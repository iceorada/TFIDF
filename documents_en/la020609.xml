<LD>Anyone who spends close to $12 million for a home to live in while
his other four are being remodeled is too out of touch to be governor of
California ("Run, Arnold, Run," by Mark Z. Barabak, May 12). If Arnold
Schwarzenegger really wants to make a difference in the lives of
children, he should donate the proceeds from his next film to the
after-school programs he touts. He may not get my vote, but at least he
would get my attention.</LD>

<TE>I have a PhD in American history from UC Berkeley. In the past four
decades I have taught at four universities and one of my books won a
national prize. But I would never pretend to be qualified for high public
office. That an actor who is known almost exclusively as an action hero
in motion pictures filled with death and mayhem is being considered for
the governorship of the the nation's largest state is a commentary on the
gullibility of the voters and the Republican Party's cynical willingness
to exploit their ignorance.</TE>

<LD>Thanks so much for the very balanced view of the difficulties faced
by our community in dealing with seriously mentally ill people ("Prelude
to a Death," by Paul Teetor, May 5). The information presented was
realistic and at the same time considered the rights and interests of
someone with a psychiatric disability and her family members. Another sad
but true aspect of mental illness is the "board and care" system that
offers living quarters for people with disabilities who are not
completely independent and whose families are unable to continue caring
for them. Thanks again for the great story.</LD>

<TE>This was not a hate crime! I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder
and know that what happened to Marie Elise West had nothing to do with
racial hatred. It had to do with messed-up brain chemicals. I hope people
will read Teetor's article and realize that the person she hit could have
been white, African American or Asian, and it wouldn't have made one bit
of difference. In fact, her delusional thinking may have led her to
believe the person was a Martian. The fact is that she did vehicular
manslaughter, whether accidental or otherwise remains to be seen, which
is in itself terrible enough. To call it a hate crime would be laughable
if it weren't such a serious accusation against a woman whose inability
to recognize that she needs medication to control a serious illness cost
the life of another human being.</TE>

<TE>What a tragic saga of a young woman being betrayed by our society. Our
Legislature passes hundreds of bills a year satisfying the whims of
effective lobbying. Where is the ACLU and other groups that are forever
lobbying on behalf of the downtrodden in our society? If there was ever a
person in need of effective advocacy, it is Marie Elise West. We always
hear about the rights of the individual being upheld; what about West's
rights to proper representation as an extremely ill woman who needs
protection from eager, politically motivated public servants? This woman
needs compassion, understanding and proper medical care--not condemnation
from a system that has thus far failed her.</TE>

<HD>The Sierra Club and the Immigration Freight Train</HD>

<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As an astronomer who studies how stars develop over tens of
millions of years, Ben Zuckerman instinctively takes the long view. What
he sees in regard to future U.S. population numbers troubles his
environmentalist's heart: As many as a billion people on the American
landscape by 2100, as many as 100 million in California, courtesy of
liberal immigration policies.</LD>
<LD>   Zuckerman, a 58-year-old UCLA professor given to running shoes and
organic rice cakes, believes environmentalists should be loudly demanding
curbs on legal immigration and an end to illegal immigration, which are
fueling the country's surging population growth. The influential Sierra
Club, to which he has belonged for more than three decades, ought to be
especially vocal on the matter, he thinks.</LD>
<LD>   Zuckerman's views conflict directly with the club's official
neutrality on immigration reform. Nonetheless, he recently was elected to
the club's board of directors with the most votes, 36,383, among the five
successful candidates, despite not being anointed by the organization's
nominating committee.</LD>
<TE>   His victory, he says, is a vindication of keen-eyed Sierrans who see
that "the No. 1 environmental problem--and it's not even close--is
overpopulation. A billion Americans is a disaster. I don't know how my
colleagues in the Sierra Club can save species and wetlands and so on
when there are a billion Americans."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the first Earth Day celebration in 1970, with American
fertility rates reaching replacement levels, environmentalists foresaw
the U.S. population being stabilized within a single generation.</TE>
<TE>   Then the immigration freight train came roaring down the track. By the
time it barreled through the 1990s, it had quadrupled traditional figures
for legal immigration, which has reached 1 million-plus per year. Illegal
immigration is estimated to be an additional 200,000 to 500,000 annually.
From 1990 to 2000, the U.S. population swelled by 13%, its largest
10-year increase ever (in the rest of the developed world, population
grew by 2.5%). According to government demographers, immigration and
immigrant fertility accounted for about 70% of the national increase, and
90% of California's.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1970s and '80s, the Sierra Club supported immigration
curbs. In the 1990s, however, the club's leadership grew shy of the issue
as it waxed in controversy. In 1998, Sierrans for U.S. Population
Stabilization, a group co-founded by Zuckerman, forced a club referendum
on the matter. The leadership pushed for neutrality, Zuckerman's faction
for support of immigration curbs. The leadership's position won, but
Zuckerman faction's received 40% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Now the club's official posture is to focus on global, as opposed to
U.S., population stabilization and to work for improved conditions in
immigrant-producing countries.</TE>
<TE>   What really motivates the club leadership, Zuckerman says, is fear.
Fear of being called racist. Fear of losing minority-group members and
fear of forfeiting financial support from big business and foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-immigration forces--including Latino politicians, the AFL-CIO and
corporations, which covet both cheap labor and more consumers--are quick
to swing the racism bludgeon. Zuckerman, a lifelong liberal and civil
rights advocate, has borne such accusations painfully. "But the average
person is overwhelmingly in favor of reduced legal immigration and an end
to illegal immigration, and this cuts across every racial line," he says.
"How can it be racist to agree with a majority of every ethnic and racial
group in the country?"</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club's timidity on the issue muddies its integrity. (How,
he asks, can the club rail against polluters for breaking environmental
laws but keep silent about immigrants who break immigration laws?) To
save itself, he says, it must refocus on protecting the American
environment and opposing growth for growth's sake, which he calls "the
ideology of a cancer cell." Emboldened by Zuckerman's victory, more
Sierrans of his persuasion are certain to run in next year's annual
election for five of the 15 board seats.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club is headquartered in San Francisco. Presumedly, the
people who run it have to commute every day through the congestion of the
Bay Area. I have to wonder, do they ever ponder the discomfort of it? Do
they really imagine, with residential development devouring space and
wildlife habitat from San Diego to Sacramento, that natural California
can survive the 50 million residents that demographers are projecting for
2025, much less the 100 million that could be living here by the end of
the century if current patterns hold?</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Hamilton, the Sierra Club's national conservation director, says
the organization remains committed to its long-standing goal of
population stabilization. It just takes a global approach now rather than
a national one. Immigration to the U.S. will dwindle, the club believes,
when conditions in immigrant-producing countries no longer compel people
to leave home.</TE>
<TE>   Or, I might point out, when conditions here become equally bad, the
swollen masses just as poor, the environment just as degraded.</TE>

real point of this intriguing article is his generosity toward 20

<LD>More popular than the Egg McMuffin, more colorful than a pack of
Skittles, the inspirational renderings of trademarked "Painter of Light"
Thomas Kinkade have captured the hearts, minds and wall space of
millions. Alas, Kinkade doesn't part with originals. (The faithful can
purchase lithographs transferred to canvas and "enhanced" with oil paint
to the tune of $660 to $10,870.)  However, a touring motor home carrying
a dozen or so original sunsets, cottages and other tableaux lets fans
gaze upon their hero's actual brush strokes, displayed to maximum effect
by dimmer-switch-operating representatives of Kinkade's Media Arts. Some
reactions at the "Traveling Museum of Light's" stop at the Thomas Kinkade
Gallery in Monrovia.</LD>

<TE>   Any other artists you like?</TE>
<TE>   Eunice: That's all I like.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry: Not really.</TE>

his paintings really stand out.</TE>
<TE>   Which one did you buy?</TE>
<TE>   "Perseverance." I've been looking for a painting with not much but
waves and storm. It's something that I can look up at. If you were a
nurse, and I'm a nurse manager, perseverance means a lot.</TE>
<TE>   What other artists do you like?</TE>

<TE>   Grace: I own his calendar. I got it as a present. I love it.</TE>
<TE>   Why do you think Thomas Kinkade is popular?</TE>
<TE>   Grace: Because he's the painter of light--the American Dream of
beautiful country houses. He even makes the city look warm and
comforting.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a favorite Kinkade work?</TE>
<TE>   Grace: I'm not sure what the name is. "Country Cottage"?</TE>
<TE>   I had a cottage in the back of our house that looked exactly like it.</TE>

<TE>   What brought you here today?</TE>
<TE>   I received a flier in the mail. I love Thomas Kinkade's work.</TE>
<TE>   Do you own any Kinkade pieces?</TE>
<TE>   "End of Perfect Day II." It's a canvas print.</TE>
<TE>   Why do you think he's so popular?</TE>
<TE>   I think there's a little bit of traditional style in his paintings and
also the aspect of being able to dim the lights.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a favorite piece?</TE>
<TE>   "Days of Peace." He's got some Native American Indians in a big valley
with the sun setting behind it. I put a bid on EBay but the reserve
wasn't met. I was the only bid.</TE>

<LD>"One day I had this vision of doing things with underwear," says
Los Angeles-based artist Caz Love. "It's one of those things that made no
sense." No matter. It was 1998 and she had previously been painting large
canvases, but the muse would not be denied, and Love's oeuvre has become
underwear, slips, corsets, bras and dresses.</LD>
<LD>   Love, 30, whose work will appear in the group show "All That Glitters"
at the Angels Gate Cultural Center in San Pedro (opening June 29), uses
text in many of the works. They incorporate conceptual, craft-based and
mixed-media elements, and range from about $1,000 to $1,800. A soft pink
dress recounts "a long, complicated dream about falling in love and all
these mystical things that are happening," says Love, who studied at
CalArts and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A little black
dress bears a vertical neck-to-hem list of women's names. Other recurring
motifs include roses and women's lips clipped from magazines. A group of
panties, strung horizontally on a pink ribbon, feature all three. "If
there's any message," she says, "it's about my personal experience, and
that I happen to be a woman."</LD>
<TE>   Love purchases many of her raw materials at area thrift shops
(panties, however, she buys new). "Sometimes," she says, "because I'm
buying, like, 15 dresses, they ask if I have a store. Then I tell them
I'm an artist." Although her pieces aren't meant to be worn, Love has had
inquiries. "My intention is three-dimensional art, whether it's sculpture
or whatever you want to call it."</TE>

<DH>A Cinematographer's Romance With Movie Magic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL VENTRE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Working in the camera department at Paramount Studios during the
early '90s, Steve Gainer often spotted tripod legs beckoning from
dumpsters on the lot. For a fledgling cinematographer who had followed
his outsize love of cameras into the movie world, those ungainly limbs
proved signposts to a gold mine of old lenses, filters and other camera
accessories tossed out thanks to the premium on storage space at studios.</LD>
<LD>   Gainer went on to become a working cinematographer, but his adventures
in back lot dumpster-diving instilled a passion for collecting antique
movie cameras, which he now puts to good use as curator of the camera
museum at the old American Society of Cinematographers clubhouse in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember driving by and seeing the ASC logo," Gainer says. "I
walked in and saw [ASC members] Stanley Cortez ["The Night of the
Hunter," "The Magnificent Ambersons"] and Vilmos Zsigmond ["McCabe &amp; Mrs.
Miller," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"] staring warily at this
long-haired freak. I got such a buzz from the place."</LD>
<TE>   The honorary society is devoted to the art of cinematography; members
(about 225, in contrast to about 6,000 members of the cinematographers
union, IATSE Local 600) are selected by invitation only. Gainer, 39,
himself has yet to join their ranks. "It requires a body of work
recognized by your peers as outstanding. I'm still a bit young--they
don't count commercials or music videos," says Gainer, who also shot last
year's controversial indie film "Bully," directed by Larry Clark.</TE>
<TE>   But Gainer couldn't stay away from the ASC, and one day building
caretaker Ben Toguchi tipped him to buried treasure in the clubhouse
crawl space. "The first thing I saw was a wooden camera," says Gainer.</TE>
<TE>   "They were used before 1912, when metal took over." Further
investigation unearthed cases upon cases of cameras, lenses, light meters
and other accessories, and a restoration obsession was born. Gainer
cleaned wood, had leather replaced at a shoe repair shop and took metal
to an aircraft-body plant for burnishing. He also kept collecting. About
three years ago, Gainer joined forces with former ASC president Victor
Kemper ("The Candidate," "Dog Day Afternoon,") to rebuild the museum,
which had been a shambles since the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the ASC camera museum has about 50 cameras on display (15 owned
by Gainer), including the only known existing E.H. Amet "sound" camera
from 1911 and a camera used in D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" and
"Intolerance." The ASC is planning to move into a new structure, freeing
its current 5,000-square-foot space for an expanded museum.</TE>
<TE>   Old-time movie magic will never be a "wrap" for Gainer, who sometimes
uses antique hand-crank cameras to shoot music videos and commercials,
and he devotes many a spare hour to his curatorial role. "I love the
styling of the old cameras, the Victorian milling and machining process,"
he says. "If I didn't have to work, I'd be here all the time."</TE>

<DH>How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in Southern California</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. KIGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom," the poet
William Blake wrote two centuries ago. Easy for him to say. Blake never
inched along in the seemingly perpetual traffic snarl of the 405, behind
the wheel of a $40,000 sport-utility vehicle that looked impressive on
the lot but which, once you got it out on the asphalt, was dwarfed by
even bigger SUVs. You're staring in your rearview mirror, for example, at
a massive Ford Excursion, 19 feet long, with 7,000 pounds of metallic
hypertrophy, chrome grillwork gleaming at you like the teeth of some
primordial beast.</LD>
<LD>   You shift uneasily in your seat, the fabric of your fashionably baggy
jeans chafing against the lush leather upholstery and take another sip of
your Starbucks Venti cappuccino. That 2,000-calorie lunch--the one you
gobbled off the extra-large 12 1/2-inch plate that has replaced the 10
1/2-incher as the restaurant industry standard--is rumbling around in
your stomach like steroid-bloated professional wrestlers locked in
violent embrace. You fiddle distractedly with the volume knob on your
400-watt stereo system as Long Beach rapper Warren G. intones, "I want it
all, all, all, all." Easy for him to say. You've already had it all, or
nearly so, but you want more. Cathedral ceilings. A 64-inch TV. A pair of
$160 Nike Men's Shox VC sneakers, the ones that look like NASA standard
issue.</LD>
<TE>   There was a time when wretched excess was the exclusive province of
divine-right monarchs and mega-millionaires. To be sure, the rich still
lead lives of otherworldly extravagance--for example, Aaron Spelling's
45-room, 56,000-square-foot Holmby Hills mansion (its footprint about as
big as a football field), or the underwater stereo system that entertains
swimmers in Bill Gates' pool. Lisa Kerkorian is demanding $320,000 a
month in child support for her 4-year-old daughter from her ex-husband,
MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian, and most people would find excessive the
$14,000 a month she says the child needs for parties and play dates and
the $436 a month she needs for pet care.</TE>
<TE>   But today the profligate rich are just one end of the continuum of
surfeit that stretches from imported suede-lined dresser drawers and
Range Rovers with imported Italian mobile espresso makers to the guy who
enhances his trailer with a working fake-log fireplace and a massive
satellite dish. Wretched excess has become a truly egalitarian motif, one
that cuts across class and cultural lines. Call it the Big Gulp Culture,
because it manifests itself not just in opulence but also in sheer
outlandish size. All around you, everything--your car, your house, your
appliances, the food you eat, the entertainment you enjoy--is oversized,
overstuffed, overdone, over-elaborate and, at times, bewilderingly
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "When do you have enough in America? Never!" says French
anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille, who has spent much of the past two
decades in this country analyzing the American consumer. "It's a culture
of excess, a permanently nouveau riche mentality. We want the biggest,
the most extreme of everything."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the super-size Zeitgeist also has spilled into some seemingly
sacrosanct aspects of our existence. If you go to religious services on
Sunday, it may be at the Forum or another arena-sized mega-church. Your
kids come home from school lugging gargantuan backpacks. The trend seems
unstoppable, even in the face of economic uncertainty and the cataclysmic
events of the past year. A survey published in Advertising Age in March,
for example, showed that even after the shock of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, 60% of consumers' spending habits remained unchanged. (In some
ways, our anxiety actually stimulated the urge to acquire. Big Toys Coach
Works, a Corona-based maker of customized vehicles, suddenly saw a jump
in demand for its line of armored SUVs, such as a $175,000 version of the
Excursion designed to withstand bullets from AK-47s and .44 magnums.)</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it's hard not to worry about the consequences of
living so large--obesity-related diseases, accidents caused by the
massiveness of our vehicles, mountains of credit card debt, the
environmental carnage we're wreaking by gobbling up resources. You've got
to wonder how much of the enmity from people elsewhere in the world is a
result of our excessive ways. And as you look down the road from 6 1/2
feet up, you've also got to wonder: How big a gulp do you have to take to
finally feel satisfied?</TE>
<TE>  We're so in love with living ever larger that it's easy to overlook how
hyperbolized our lives have become. "In France, you have a little thing
on your plate," explains anthropologist Rapaille. "In America, you get a
plate [and] think it's for five people. The first time I saw an American
walk-in closet, it was a shock for me. In France, you have an armoire to
keep clothes in. Here, you have a room. In France, everything is supposed
to be petite to be good--you have petite maison, a little house, a little
car, a little dog, a little wife. In France, when it comes to breasts,
most of the cosmetic surgery is for reduction. In America, women want to
get bigger--and they're bigger already." (During the past decade, the
average American bra size--unaugmented--has increased from 34B to 36C,
and the typical breast implant has gone up a half size.)</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Rapaille objects to American excess. The expatriate, who
has studied the effect on immigrants' values of moving to America, says
that excess is contagious. "French people love California," he notes.
"They come here, and suddenly they want to build the biggest house on the
block and drive an SUV."</TE>
<TE>   In ways both subtle and obvious, the media feed America's appetite for
more of everything. HBO's breakthrough success, "The Sopranos," features
a lumbering protagonist who lives in a "New Jersey Elegant" suburban
mansion, drives an SUV and spends much of each cable network episode
drinking to excess and consuming enormous quantities of ziti and
prosciutto. Sports heroes generally tend to be big, but being large isn't
enough for Laker star Shaquille O'Neal. He lives large behind the wheel
of a $300,000 Bentley Arnage that he had gutted and customized into a
lowrider with hydraulic switches. Looking for a pinup girl who embodies
the national mood? How about former Playboy playmate and Guess jeans
model-turned-plus-size-heiress Anna Nicole Smith?</TE>
<TE>   There's no escaping evidence of our love affair with excess. Pick a
category:</TE>
<TE>Food and Drink</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when 20 ounces of soda seemed thirst-quenching
enough. Then, in 1976, 7-Eleven tested a 32-ounce container for fountain
drinks at one of its stores in Torrance. The store sold out its entire
stock of 1,000 cups in a single weekend. Since then, the original Big
Gulp has been offered in increasingly large containers, culminating with
the 64-ounce Double Gulp. The Big Gulp cup was redesigned in 1998 after
the company discovered it was too big to fit standard car cup holders.
Starbucks unveiled its Venti (Italian for "20") coffee cup in 1996 and
the following year quietly dropped its 8-ounce Short size from store
menus. (A company spokesperson says they're still available on request.)</TE>
<TE>   Meal portions are bigger, regardless of whether you're dining in
fast-food or upscale restaurants. As recently as the mid-1990s, a 10
1/2-inch plate was standard in the restaurant industry. Today the
standard is 12 1/2 inches. Maggiano's Little Italy, an Italian restaurant
chain, uses a 15 5/8-inch model to handle its large serving of pasta,
which weighs an astonishing 1 pound without sauce. New York University
nutrition professor Lisa Young, who has studied the evolution of food
portions, says that the McDonald's Super Size portion of fries is an
ounce larger than the 1998 version. A single portion combined with a
Quarter Pounder with cheese and a super-size Coke provides half of the
2,900 recommended daily calories for a man between the ages of 25 and 50.</TE>
<TE>Shopping</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, Americans shopped in supermarkets. Today we're
likely to buy groceries in 100,000-plus-square-foot warehouse clubs,
where we pay from $30 to $100 for an annual membership. That entitles us
to stuff our shopping carts with products that are themselves
gigantic--44-pound bags of dog food and 300-tablet bottles of pain
reliever. Sales at warehouse clubs and superstores grew by nearly 50%
between 1996 and 2000, to $416 billion.</TE>
<TE>Homes</TE>
<TE>   The floor plan for a typical new house these days is 2,300 square
feet, making it 55% bigger than the average home built in 1970. Since the
late 1980s, the kitchen in a typical new California home has gone from
120 square feet to 200, and living rooms increasingly have been replaced
by "great rooms," often with a two-story atrium ceiling. "What's
interesting is that the size of the typical family has decreased by 20%,"
says Gopal Ahluwalia, an economist for the National Assn. of Home
Builders. "So the amount of space for each person has increased even
more."</TE>
<TE>   You probably didn't notice the additional expanse because the house
likely is filled with bigger furniture, appliances and fixtures. In those
gigantic kitchens, the refrigerator has gone from 22 or 23 inches to 27
inches deep--so out-sized that it sticks out from between the counters.
The great room has to be bigger, explains Ahluwalia, because you need 12
to 15 feet of space to comfortably watch a 64-inch projection TV. In the
bedroom, mattresses are nearly twice as thick as they were in the
mid-1980s. In the bathroom, the standard tub is giving way to a "garden
tub," an oval tub for two with powerful water jets. About 7% of bathroom
remodeling upgrades now include a TV or stereo. The garage is getting
bigger too--according to Ahluwalia, a three-car space is now standard.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Personal Transportation</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, when Americans still cringed from memories of the long lines
and skyrocketing prices at gas stations during Middle East instability,
Japanese compact cars ruled the highways and bulky four-wheel-drive
vehicles seemed headed for oblivion, like mastodons to the tar pits. That
year, Americans bought fewer than 250,000 SUVs, of which 10 different
models were available.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, with the Middle East in turmoil and gas prices again on the
rise, Americans bought 4 million SUVs--about a quarter of the entire
automobile market--and could choose from 61 different kinds. Most popular
are the two-ton mid-size variety--nearly twice the size of a typical
compact car. Two years ago, Ford unveiled the biggest SUV ever, the
nine-passenger Excursion. For the truly excessive, there's the H-1
Hummer, the $100,000 civilian version of the military vehicle. It's
slightly smaller than the Excursion but capable of climbing a 2-foot wall
and driving from Long Beach to downtown L.A. at 30 mph with two flat
tires.</TE>
<TE>   Why anyone might need such a thing in balmy Southern California is
another question--but not one that has kept those behemoths off the
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The impulse for excess is hardly new. Prehistoric hunters apparently
wiped out entire species of giant mammals to satisfy their craving for
meat. The Romans were notorious gluttons. In 17th century France, Louis
XIV spent the equivalent of $500 million to build a residence at
Versailles. The Gilded Age of the late 19th century spawned William
Howard Taft, the first super-sized president, and products such as Sears,
Roebuck and Co.'s "Large Gent's Easy Chair," the forerunner of today's
Barcalounger and La-Z-Boy. Credit turn-of-the-century scholar Thorstein
Veblen with coining the term "conspicuous consumption" to describe
well-to-do Americans' obsession with acquiring baubles to impress one
another. "In order to be reputable it must be wasteful," Veblen wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But back then, excess was different. Only the wealthiest Americans
could afford to consume outlandishly, and subtlety was part of the
allure. Expensive things didn't necessarily look expensive, except for
details that served as a sort of secret handshake between one member of
the moneyed class and another. "A guy like J.P. Morgan didn't necessarily
have to live in the most enormous mansion," explains Jerry Herron,
director of American Studies at Wayne State University in Michigan. "It
was the stuff inside that mattered, the antiques and tapestries whose
value the ordinary people wouldn't have understood unless he explained it
to them."</TE>
<TE>   The rise of Hollywood may have changed that dynamic. The nouveau riche
movie moguls and stars had more money than sophistication or couth, and
it showed. When silent-film director Erich von Stroheim's wife had her
hair catch fire during a "dry shampoo" treatment at a chic Hollywood
salon, for example, an attendant grabbed a fur coat belonging to an
unnamed star. "Not my coat!" the star screamed, snatching it back. In
1929, Joan Crawford decorated her new mansion in what she called "the
apotheosis of taste"--green and gold furnishings and bric-a-brac that
included 2,000 dolls, a life-size toy hen that cackled and laid eggs, and
a walking, grunting life-size ersatz piglet. "Everything I earn, I
spend!" she once boasted to a reporter. Even the most arrogantly
intellectual star of Hollywood's golden age, Orson Welles, couldn't
resist the sheer exhilaration of excess. In addition to "Citizen Kane,"
he was once credited with consuming 18 Pink's hot dogs at a single
sitting.</TE>
<TE>   The conspicuousness of that consumption helped transform excess from
an upper-class vice into a mass obsession in the years after World War
II. "We came out not just as the victor but as the biggest economic power
in the world," Herron says. "We were in a position to produce a lot of
stuff, but without a war to fight, our manufacturing capacity vastly
exceeded our need for things. So to avoid another Depression, we had to
create a need. That's the moment, I think, when ostentatiousness started
to change. Collectively, society figured out that it would take a long
time to teach a guy like my pop, who'd just come back from the service,
to start collecting art or buying antiques. It was simpler just to tell
him, 'Hey man, get yourself a bigger house and a second car.' Size and
quantity are a lot easier to understand."</TE>
<TE>   In the decades that followed, the ordinary American appetite for
excess became oversimplified and extreme. "We have a confusion between
quality and quantity," says Sylvia Stein, an executive with Consumer
Eyes, a New York-based consulting firm that has helped Fortune 500
clients develop new products ranging from telecommunications technology
to toilet paper. "These days, life moves too fast and people have too
much to do. When they go shopping, they don't have time to really look at
a product and think about it. So they go for the largest, or the fastest,
or the most powerful. Those are the things that require no sophistication
to spot. You get instant validation and gratification. It's the biggest,
so it must be the best."</TE>
<TE>   The faith in bigness has become increasingly ingrained, which itself
creates a strange sort of inflation. Marketing researcher Brian Wansink,
director of the Food &amp; Brand Lab at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, found that consumers perceive products in large
packages as less expensive than smaller ones--even though they often
aren't. As a result, they actually use 18% to 45% more than they
otherwise would.</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologist Rapaille says the desire for excess comes from the
"reptilian brain," the earliest, most primitive structures in our mental
evolution. "The reptilian wants to grab as much food as possible, to be
as big and powerful as possible, because it's focused on survival. When
it comes to a choice between the intellect and the reptilian, the
reptilian always wins."</TE>
<TE>   Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable
appetites have left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were
two decades ago, and more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and
diabetes. We're racking up mountains of debt (the late fees we pay on
credit cards have more than tripled since 1996, to $7.3 billion a year)
and burning up fossil fuels like crazy. We demand things that, deep down,
we don't really want or even use. When Stein's marketing firm surveyed
real estate agents, they discovered an odd phenomenon: People build big
houses without thinking about what they're actually going to do with all
that space. "When you look at how the family actually lives, it turns out
that they spend all their time in one corner of the place."</TE>
<TE>   Many of us are using the remaining space to remedy what J. Walker
Smith, president of the North Carolina-based market research company
Yankelovich Partners, has termed a "claustrophobia of abundance." That
is, people already own so much stuff that they're running out of places
to put it. The number of self-storage warehouses has tripled during the
past decade and a half in order to handle our orgiastic acquisitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons America's in trouble now, despite the fact that
we're one of the most religious countries in the world, is that we're
perceived as materialists and secular," said political scientist Benjamin
Barber, author of "Jihad vs. McWorld," during a recent TV interview.
"When they look at our movies, when they look at our fast food, when they
look at our MTV, they perceive an unreal America, an America that leaves
no room for spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The thesis has at least one hole as big as the sunroof in Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar's pearl-colored VX Limited Edition Toyota
Land Cruiser (complete with the optional leather interior and--despite
the Taliban's proscription of music--a CD player). Diane Crispell, an
editor for the opinion research firm Roper ASW, says survey data shows
that anti-American attitudes aren't necessarily coupled with a yearning
for austerity. "People in the Middle East, for example, are very big on
luxury brands--but they prefer European, not American, products," she
explains. "How they feel about us doesn't affect their feeling about
consumption of material goods."</TE>
<TE>   Still, we've got to worry about what the future may bring. After all,
the Web site for the Center for the New American Dream, an organization
that advocates a more moderate lifestyle, estimates that if each of the
planet's 6 billion inhabitants consumed at the level of the average
American, we would need four additional planets' worth of natural
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jay Leno is making jokes about SUVs," says product consultant
Stein, "you know that it's at last all starting to become uncool."</TE>
<TE>   But fear not, consumers. Wretched excess may not be going away.
Instead, like Mike Myers' fictional Dr. Evil, it may simply be cloned and
miniaturized. "Small is the new big," predicts American studies scholar
Herron, who recently noticed two yuppies trying to one-up each other
about the tininess of their cell phones. The hot new status car in
Hollywood is BMW's revival of the 1960s Austin Mini Cooper, a vehicle
about a third the weight of an Excursion. The new Mini, though, is
anything but minimalist--add the power glass moonroof, the CD player, the
in-dash computer navigation system, leather trim and other options, and
the price can rival that of some SUVs. Even 4 1/2 inches off the
pavement, it seems, we're still stuck in gridlock along the road to the
palace of wisdom.</TE>

<TE>Excess by the Numbers</TE>
<TE>L.A's All-Time Scoring Champ</TE>
<TE>   In his 1991 autobiography, "A View From Above," the late Laker
superstar center Wilt Chamberlain claimed that he had sex with 20,000
women, a rate of 1.2 women per day. Since Chamberlain lived for eight
years after making that statement, the total number at that rate may be
closer to 23,500. In any case, he far outperformed Giovanni Giacomo
Casanova, the 18th century musician, spy and memoirist whose surname
became a synonym for libertine. He had 132 lovers during his 61 years of
sexual activity. To appreciate Chamberlain's self-proclaimed
prodigiousness, consider that at two minutes per encounter--the typical
length for American males, according to sex researcher Alfred
Kinsey--Chamberlain spent nearly the equivalent of 12 full 82-game NBA
seasons having sex.</TE>

<DH>Heiress Joan Irvine Smith Is Emerging as an Advocate for
Environmental 'Balance'--an Unusual Role for Someone Whose Family Helped
Pave Paradise</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD E. CHEVERTON AND LAURA SAARI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a coming out, of sorts, although few of the 600 people
crowded into the Corona del Mar elementary school auditorium sensed it on
that fateful evening in mid-January 2001. To the seasoned (and probably
cynical) observer, it was just another public hearing on yet another
Orange County development plan. The "not-in-my-backyard" folks would
protest; the environmentalists would squawk; then the public servants
would depart and, soon thereafter, the bulldozers would rumble again.</LD>
<LD>   The project in question was a deal struck quietly during the Wilson
administration's waning days to demolish the old termite-riddled beach
cottages in Crystal Cove State Park, to be replaced by new cottages that
would rent for $375 a night. The developer, Michael Freed, had impeccable
environmental chops--he had created the Post Ranch resort in Big Sur, and
if you could build there, well, you had to figure you could build just
about anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   But Freed and his political allies had made a mistake, although they
would have needed an exquisitely subtle understanding of Orange County
history to anticipate it. They had decided to build in the childhood
playground of one of the county's most eccentric, irascible, implacable
and energetic citizens, one of the last Orange Countians who had actually
lived the area's fabled, bucolic, undeveloped past--an era of immense
land-holdings lorded over by bigger-than-life ranching dynasties; the
Orange County of oranges, for heaven's sake; of cattle and country roads
and unspoiled beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Freed hadn't figured on crossing Joan Irvine Smith.</TE>
<TE>   And now, here she was, standing to voice her displeasure at what this
interloper was proposing to do to Crystal Cove as the crowd thundered,
"Joan, Joan, Joan." Somehow, in the hullabaloo, Freed never got a chance
to speak. By the end of the evening, it was clear that two things had
happened:</TE>
<TE>   Michael Freed's resort was dead as a doornail.</TE>
<TE>   And Joan Irvine Smith was back where she has been, on and off, for
four tumultuous decades: in the headlines and in the thick of battle.</TE>
<TE>   Now the stakes in another ongoing development battle have sharply
escalated both for Smith and those who seem certain to cross paths, if
not swords, with her. She predicts, "There's going to be a real battle
down here with respect to development in the south part of the county."
At issue is a plan developed by the Rancho Mission Viejo Co. that would
put 14,000 houses on a prime cut of land on the historic O'Neill Ranch, a
spread not quite as big as her great-grandfather's 120,000 acres right
next door and a few miles up the serpentine Ortega Highway from Smith's
own horsy estate in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are good, close friends of mine," she says. "I'm a
tenant of theirs. I've told Tony [Moiso, who runs the company that owns
and manages the O'Neill Ranch] on more than one occasion--you've got to
go in and study this thing and have a balance. You've got to work with
these environmental communities, because they'll tie you up in court a
long time."</TE>
<TE>   The lady should know: she spent more than 30 years in court with the
various overlords of her family's Irvine Ranch. But now, fresh from the
Crystal Cove coup, Smith sees herself as a player who can bring these
intractable, warring enemies to the table, bang some sense into their
heads. "I think we're going to change the world here," she says, with not
a hint of doubt. "We're going to have a balance between the environmental
community and the development community. We're going to change
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Schoenkopf, one of the OC Weekly's acid-tongued columnists,
sees it differently, as do others around the county. "That's a little bit
bizarre coming from an Irvine," Schoenkopf says. "That's where she got
all of her money, isn't it? Didn't her family pave over all of Orange
County? Isn't that pretty much how it happened?"</TE>
<TE>   As with all things Irvine, it is--and, then again, it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   To understand Joan Irvine Smith--to understand Orange County--you need
to grasp the immensity, the pervasiveness of the original Irvine Ranch,
which encompassed more than 185 square miles of the county and reached 22
miles inland from Newport Beach to the edge of the Cleveland National
Forest. Consider how Los Angeles might be a very different place if one
man had owned fully a quarter of its surface area--and if, over the
years, through all the twists and turns of ownership, the land was still
owned by one man. It might make the entire West Side of the city look
like--well, like Irvine. Or the Newport Coast, where the current owner's
fancy for Italian Renaissance hill towns has created a cleaned-up
Urbino-on-the-Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch was first assembled in 1864 from the tatters of
drought-stricken Mexican rancheros by James Irvine (two partners were
quickly bought out), a taciturn immigrant Scots-Irishman who made his
first pile selling supplies to the plungers rushing through San Francisco
during the Gold Rush. Irvine thought it would make a fine place to
pasture sheep for his wool operation, though there's no evidence he saw
the land before he bought it.</TE>
<TE>   The land-holdings inevitably became something more than that. His son,
James II, applied the magic elixir--water--and transformed the sleepy
ranch into an agricultural powerhouse incorporated as The Irvine Co. He
also made a colossal mistake, transferring control of the ranch to The
James Irvine Foundation. It left daughter Joan Irvine Smith and her
mother, Athalie Clarke, minority shareholders. That's when the trouble
began as, over the years, the foundation's ownership was replaced by a
gaggle of Eastern moguls (among them Henry Ford II), then, in a
masterpiece of financial legerdemain, by its current owner, Donald Bren.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Irvine Smith fought them all. In 1990, she (and her mother)
cashed out for $256 million, severing her last legal ties with the ranch.
In 1994, she was listed at 341 on the Forbes magazine list of richest
Americans, with a fortune of $350 million. Now she says, "I'm way below"
that figure and "happy" to be off the list. The money has been spread
among dozens of projects: art, horses, a foundation, books--the woman is,
if nothing else, busy-busy-busy.</TE>
<TE>   At first sight, her good works seem like the high-priced hobbies of
the Very Rich. But a second glance reveals an internal logic that, as
always, tracks back to the land and its inexorable hold on this
energetic, blunt-speaking 68-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   One example: Last fall, Mrs. Smith (everyone around her calls her that
and only that) made an appearance at the Thermond Clarke Library (named
for her stepfather) at Chapman University in Orange. The occasion:
publication of "California: The Golden Land of Promise," co-written by
Smith and Jean Stern, executive director of the Irvine Museum, which was
created by Smith and is devoted to her pervasive sense of preserving, if
only on canvas, the vision of a long-ago Eden. The 5 1/2-pound, $50 tome,
once conceived modestly as the outgrowth of a pamphlet put out for a
local celebration, quickly burgeoned into the first volume in a projected
trilogy, its 365 pages sprinkled lavishly with full-color illustrations
(many drawn from Smith's lode of 4,000 plein-air paintings).</TE>
<TE>   The book ends with the founding of the Irvine Ranch, which gets 30
pages of ink compared with 20 for the Gold Rush. It's a lavish
coffee-table volume, one that a decorator might arrange precisely next to
a potted phalenopsis. Smith's goal for the book, though, fits perfectly
with her messianic zeal--the same impulse, as it turns out, that led her
to buy all of that art, create the museum and issue 11 books on
California painting since 1992. "It's a soft-sell to preserve the
environment," she says. "It's been my hope that eventually, in time, in
some way, this art will be helpful in building some sort of bridge
between the development community and the environmental community."</TE>
<TE>   Smith doesn't just plan to drop the book into the local Barnes &amp; Noble
store. Instead she muses that "maybe every school could have a book and
have CDs that kids could learn from."</TE>
<TE>   James Doti, president of Chapman University in Orange, says, "We're
working on the possibility of doing that," adding, "I know that Mrs.
Smith is already working with educators and asking them questions about
how it might best be done. She's not working in a vacuum and saying,
'Let's just do it this way and foist it on the schools.' "</TE>
<TE>   A $50 book in every California school? Talk to Joan-watchers in Orange
County and they'll agree with museum director Jean Stern: "She knows
exactly what she wants and she's willing to pay for it." Which puts the
following conversation into a certain perspective. Smith is seated in the
living room of one of her houses at The Oaks, her 22-acre equestrian
center along San Juan Creek. A Guy Rose plein-air painting hangs over the
fireplace (it's probably worth a million, Stern estimates), dozens of
images of horses and things equestrian scattered about, including a photo
of a younger Joan draped gracefully over the neck of a powerful jumper in
flight. A visiting reporter observes: "If you look back on your
great-grandfather's era, these were gigantic people. They seemed to think
big."</TE>
<TE>   "Real big!" says the heiress, a wry smile spreading across her
outdoorsy, no-makeup visage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if that's possible anymore," muses the writer.</TE>
<TE>   There is a long pause. Then, quietly, the smile widening, the heiress
says: "I think big," punctuating it with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The record of big thinking is plainly there, writ large in deeds that
hardly begin to relate the impact of her philanthropy:</TE>
<TE>   * Smith's lobbying for a master plan for the Irvine Ranch led (for
better or worse) to the creation of Irvine, the city, and the donation of
1,000 acres for UC Irvine, where a building is named for her and she has
given $1 million for atmospheric research and $2 million for the medical
school, among other largesse.</TE>
<TE>   * Her founding of the Joan Irvine Smith &amp; Athalie R. Clarke
Foundation, which has bankrolled countless good works, including $1
million for UCI's Reeve-Irvine Research Center to search for a cure for
spinal cord injuries, such as the one that paralyzed actor Christopher
Reeve (one reason she became so enamored of Reeve, she says, is because
Reeve refused to allow family members to shoot the horse from which he
fell).</TE>
<TE>   * She created the National Water Research Institute, a consortium of
Southern California water and sanitation districts that funds studies on
water use, recycling and technology--the third-largest water research
agency in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The list of her beneficiaries goes on: the museum in Irvine (put
together after a two-year, $15-million art-buying binge that one critic
called a "fury"); her horse ranch The Oaks, where, until recent years,
she hosted The Oaks Classic, jumper-horse charity events noted for their
lavish presentations for the Land Rover set, as well as the 1999 Olympic
equestrian trials. She also owns a 42-acre breeding facility near
Escondido, plus a 250-acre estate in old-money hunt country near
Middleburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   And yet there is an inevitable "and yet" about Smith. This is the
woman who, at one point in her legal battle with the ranch's owners,
slept with a 12-gauge shotgun, traveled with bodyguards and changed homes
frequently. Who obsessively banged out letters and reports--sometimes as
much as 200 pounds a day--to city officials and Irvine Co. management. In
1987, an Orange County Register profile characterized her as "once a
social gadabout, increasingly tagged as a reclusive eccentric."</TE>
<TE>   Even the creation of her museum drew flak: "I feel like cursing the
well-meaning people who brought this once-obscure work [plein-air
landscape painting] back into the public eye," wrote a former Los Angeles
Times art critic. ("I don't care. So what?" says Smith about the
carping.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the matter of the nasty and very public battle with her
youngest son, Morton, over his choice of bride. Smith disapproved and
threatened to disinherit him. Morton responded by inviting the National
Enquirer to the wedding and appearing on the "Today" show, creating, his
mother complained, a "public spectacle." (Now Smith says she and Morton
are "having a great time" and have patched up the spat.)</TE>
<TE>   Other eyebrow-lifters: Smith's accusation against parties unknown that
they had injected her top breeding stallion, South Pacific, with a rare
and deadly parasite. She offered a $10,000 reward to find the culprit;
thus far it's uncollected. Then she got new headlines by offering two
smallish Laguna seaside lots for $40 million (so far, no takers). One
impeccable observer of Orange County's rich lauds her philanthropies and
lavish tastes, then quietly wonders, as if the KGB is on the line, if
perhaps she is "crazy." Another says that dealing with Smith is like
"walking on eggshells."</TE>
<TE>   Fern Pirkle, head of the Friends of the Irvine Coast, which has long
battled the Irvine Co., joins other county Joan-watchers in wondering
what's behind the facade. "Well, one wonders, doesn't one?" Pirkle muses.
"There's always been suspicion about her motives." Smith agrees.
"Anything I do, people are skeptical," she says, although she betrays
little concern. As she's fond of saying, "That's the way the mop flops."</TE>
<TE>   Talk to Smith and you're immediately struck by her extraordinary
memory--one acquaintance calls it "almost photographic"--for names,
circumstances, who worked for which law firm, who was an ally or (more
likely) an enemy. She has a Byzantine scholar's appreciation for
double-dealing, under-the-table alliances, treachery, lies.</TE>
<TE>   She flips through a card table-sized scrapbook filled with dozens of
yellowing newspaper clippings, most detailing her battles with the old
local bulls and Eastern tycoons who so consistently, so disastrously,
underestimated the heiress.</TE>
<TE>   But, in truth, there wasn't much in her background back in the
far-simpler times of the 1950s to warn the grizzled gents that this
beautiful, athletic blond, hair worn in the de rigueur Republican flip,
would be so much trouble.</TE>
<TE>   She nearly died at birth, surviving only after an emergency
transfusion. Her father, James Irvine III, known as Jase, had contracted
tuberculosis, so Joan was turned over to her maternal grandparents and a
nanny named "Dear-dear." Two years later, Jase died. His daughter had
been christened Athalie, but at 4, she unilaterally changed her name to
Joan, taking her cue from a Mother Goose rhyme: "Here am I/Little jumping
Joan/When nobody's with me/I'm always alone."</TE>
<TE>   She spent her childhood on ritzy Oakhurst Drive in Beverly Hills. "I
had to go to Shirley Temple's birthday party every year," Smith recalls.
"I hated it." The boy next door, Joel Rapp, remembers young Joan
constantly badgering him to build forts and climb trees higher than he
wanted to go. "She was a tough little tyrant," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Later she attended Westridge, a private girl's school in Pasadena,
where classmates noted her passion for low-cut dresses and "liquid
luaus." She made her debut with the prestigious Las Madrinas in Los
Angeles, which funds research programs at Children's Hospital and
sponsors debutante balls for its volunteers. She tried college--Marymount
in Los Angeles, then UC Berkeley--but she didn't finish her freshman
year. She took private art lessons with Alberto Vargas, the famous World
War II pin-up artist. With a fortune estimated at $125 million, she
quickly caught the attention of the national media, which dubbed the
horsewoman the "rugged little rich girl."</TE>
<TE>   She lived a fairy-tale life, dancing until dawn at Maxim's de Paris;
haunting Rodeo Drive boutiques, vacationing at the Royal Hawaiian. At 19,
she married lifeguard Charles Swinden: they had one son, James, but the
marriage didn't last. She then met a handsome Navy pilot, Russell
Penniman, while spearfishing near the family cove in Laguna Beach. With
Penniman, she soared over the Andes in a single-engine Cessna, slept in
Amazon huts, hunted water buffalo and photographed the adventure for
Sports Illustrated. The marriage produced a second child, Russell, but
the union lasted less than three years. A third marriage, to contractor
Richard Burt, a former Laguna Beach High School football star, also
proved short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   She later met Morton "Cappy" Smith, a gentleman farmer,
internationally known horseman and master of the hunt in Middleburg, Va.
Smith, 19 years her senior, recalled, "I was the only person who set
limits for her." After 12 years, the marriage foundered. Smith says it
might have lasted "if I hadn't been involved in so much litigation and
traveling."</TE>
<TE>   During her childhood summers, Joan had been dispatched to the ranch.
"I had to go with my grandfather whether I wanted to or not," she
recalls. "It was a forced march. He wanted me there."</TE>
<TE>   She was "in awe" of him. "He was a hard worker and a hard man. He ran
his house and his company like a feudal court. He'd like to make sure you
were tough." When little Joan crawled up to the piano as her grandfather
was playing, he would step on her fingers. "The longer I wouldn't cry,
the better he'd like it," she remembers. A sign over Irvine's roll-top
desk read: "Often the best way to show warm sympathy is with cold cash."</TE>
<TE>   In June 1957, at age 24, Joan Irvine appeared at her first meeting of
The James Irvine Foundation board. She brought attorney Howard Friedman
along (board members refused to allow him into the meeting room). And
then she demanded that the ranch's manager step down.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd known Joan since she was a baby," foundation chairman N. Loyall
McClaren said later. "When she first came on the board, I thought she'd
be easy to handle. But from the beginning, we got absolutely nowhere. She
was pretty spoiled. From the time Joan was able to comprehend things, she
was raised by her mother and stepfather to believe she was the only
person with the brains to run this great project."</TE>
<TE>   Smith agreed. In one of her letters to McClaren, which she leaked to
the press, she wrote, "I am an Irvine. You are not. Consequently, the
present and future welfare of the company is a matter of deep personal
concern to me."</TE>
<TE>   The issue quickly became the ranch's development--or lack of it.
Orange County, by the early '60s, was exploding, all except the little
farm village of Irvine, with its bean warehouse, post office and general
store. "Last time I counted noses, there were 41 residents. That's one
less than we had 10 years ago," Bill Cook, manager of the Orange County
Bean &amp; Grain Growers Assn., said in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Irvine wanted to change that. She lobbied for donating 1,000
acres for a new University of California campus (it was hardly altruism;
she knew how Westwood had boomed after UCLA opened). She demanded that a
master plan be developed and supported hiring a first-class architect,
William Pereira. When she felt she was being cut out of a land deal, she
threatened to liquidate the company. She learned how to play the press,
making reporters shareholders for a day so they could gain access to
private meetings. She staged rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Smith went to Washington and lobbied "for eight or nine years." It
worked. A clause in the Tax Reform Act of 1969 essentially forced the
Irvine Foundation to dump its stock in the ranch. They responded by
secretly courting Mobil Oil, a move that brought Smith and her mother
back into court--and secret negotiations of their own. In 1977, Smith
sold her 22% interest for $72 million and 11% of a new company bankrolled
by high-profile investors Henry Ford II, New York investment banker
Charles Allen and shopping center tycoon Alfred Taubman, who bought the
Irvine Co. from The James Irvine Foundation. There was a fourth partner:
a young local developer named Donald Bren.</TE>
<TE>   He, too, had grown up in Hollywood (the son of actress Claire Trevor),
but there the resemblance ended. Within a year, tensions again began to
mount between Smith and the new board. She was removed from the executive
committee and blocked once again from direct access to the company. By
1983, the situation had become so acrimonious that Smith simply wanted
out. Bren offered to buy her stock, but she wanted $330 million, three
times more than he was willing to pay. So began another epic legal
battle.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, a Michigan court referee (where the Irvine Co. was
incorporated) awarded Joan and her mother $256 million. Irvine Co.
attorney William B. Campbell said it was "pretty much a clean sweep for
us." Smith retorted, "I don't see Donald has such a great victory."</TE>
<TE>   Now the woman who once fumed that Bren is a "damned liar" says of the
famously reclusive chairman's efforts at environmental preservation, "I'm
very pleased with what Donald's doing. I don't have any quarrel with
Donald. He paid me. I'm not mad at Donald and I think Donald's done a
good job." Then she bestows the ultimate accolade: "Donald is doing what
I would have done."</TE>
<TE>   Informed of the kind words, a source from within the Irvine Co. says
that the chairman respects Smith--and their argument was never personal,
just business.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Joan Irvine Smith's newest--and oldest--
battle: the land. And the question that even Smith grants is
"interesting": whether she has the diplomatic skills to "herd cats," as
she puts it, and bring together the parties divided over the proposed
Rancho Mission Viejo Co. project and other development vs. preservation
issues. On that score, the results are mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched it happen [with Crystal Cove]," says Chris Evans, executive
director of the United States operation of the Surfrider Foundation. "I
remember a particular meeting, I will never forget it. There was an issue
that many environmental groups in the county had disparate opinions
about--and, of course, that's one way that things all kinda go to hell.</TE>
<TE>   "She just basically invited them all over to the ranch, packed them in
a room--a little like Al Capone--and said, 'Hey, let's find out if
there's some piece of music we can all start playing at the same time.'
After that meeting, which she chaired, it was clear that there was a page
we could all get on."</TE>
<TE>   Others in the fractious environmentalist community see Smith's
presence a little differently. "Some people really resented her [holding
the meetings]," says Pirkle, of Friends of the Irvine Coast. "The state
parks people are pretty sensitive to this, and they've asked me many
questions, like, 'Do you think people resent her? Do you think she's
taken it over too completely?' And I've given them the same answer--that
she does tend to take things over, but as far as I can tell it's all for
the best."</TE>
<TE>   Now the formidable Joan Irvine Smith gaze turns toward the O'Neill
Ranch, those 14,000 houses. "In my conversations with Tony Moiso and
Richard O'Neill, every opportunity I get I tell [them] no matter what
[they] build, going up this Ortega Highway, with all these oak trees and
so forth, nobody is going to be happy about it." Later she adds: "I have
a good rapport with these people and I can talk with them and tell them
the same thing I told Donald [Bren], that when you look back with respect
to the various land developers, how many of them do you really remember?
Their great legacies will be what they can set aside in open space for
future generations."</TE>
<TE>   Richard O'Neill, Smith's friend, has a reply. "This ranch is the
mother of all open space." And, later, "I agree with her. So what? You
have to develop [some of the ranch] for the partners to get their money
out of it."</TE>
<TE>   It all comes down to--what did the equestrienne call it? Balance. Nice
when you maintain it. Ugly when you fall.</TE>

<HD>In Search of the Greeting Card Poets</HD>
<DH>Who's Responsible for the Verses that Announce Every Holiday
Imaginable? If You're Thinking Blue-Haired Ladies, Think Again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My wife is a greeting cards scholar, a human archive of Father's
Day and other card-sent messages for every occasion, committing them to
memory as book-burning foes do great literature in Ray Bradbury's
"Fahrenheit 451."</LD>
<LD>   No wonder it can take her an hour to select just the right card.</LD>
<LD>   My own method is a bit more pragmatic. I call it
close-my-eyes-and-pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey card buying. In and out in
five minutes.</LD>
<TE>   What I wonder after receiving cards, though, is who writes these
suckers? Who belongs to this faceless literati, and do they know their
iambics from their pentameters? Are they legitimate writers and artists
with imagination and original thoughts? Or are they hacks and
manipulators who strum heartstrings like banjos?</TE>
<TE>   I envision a greeting card mill. Inside are not writers in the usual
sense but doyennes of schmaltz, an assembly line of blue-haired
grandmothers in tennis shoes, dabbing at their eyes with hankies while
turning out verse for satin hearts and pop-up Santas.</TE>
<TE>   My card savant tells me I'm wrong and points me in the direction of
Erika Oller.</TE>
<TE>   This peek at the creative process begins, high up the food chain of
fertile minds, in Pasadena. It's where my wife and I sit on a sofa,
settling in comfortably, when a large German shepherd climbs onto her
lap. He's not moving.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a card," says Oller, a painter and former social worker.
"Only [in the artwork] he'd be twice as big, and you'd really be scared."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, this is life imitating card art. You can already buy Oller's
"Lap Dog," which portrays a massive, spike-toothed bulldog contentedly
seated on a woman in a chair like a fat Buddha while mostly blocking her
from view. The expression on her melon face says she's resigned to being
pinned down until he decides to leave. The caption: "It's Nice to Be
Close!"</TE>
<TE>   There's other evidence that Oller is guided by personal experience:
the card that shows two women on a beach, aghast at a bald man in a
bathing suit as he walks past, flaunting his titanic belly just before he
gobbles a hot dog. The caption: "Moving Violation." Oller says the man is
her brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Her keen observations, sharp wit and talent for painting have
converged in these greetings for a decade, and she's built a micro empire
of cards, cocktail napkins, coffee mugs, wallpaper, T-shirts and gift
bags.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., and American
Greetings Corp. in Cleveland are the Hertz and Avis of this industry,
controlling 53% and 40%, respectively, of a "personal expression" market
that generates $7.5 billion in annual sales. But Oller's own yield,
through Salt Lake City manufacturer/distributor Bottman Design Inc., is
stratospheric for an independent entrepreneur. It rose to 431,000 card
sales in the U.S. and abroad in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   First she creates the images--some in watercolor, some in an oil
process called monotype--then she writes the lines:</TE>
<TE>   A female dumpling embraces a cat while blissfully reclining in a chair
as three other cats watch from above. The caption: "Waiting Their Turn."</TE>
<TE>   A 400-pound cat looms on a bookcase behind two tiny women on a settee.
The caption: "Fluffy's House."</TE>
<TE>   Oller not only adores animals, she displays an acute awareness of ways
that pets relate to humans, which accounts for their prominence in her
work. "I'm more comfortable with them," she says. "People can be awfully
tiring."</TE>
<TE>   And obese. In Oller's card universe of whimsy and irony, her human
figures, especially the women, are often as wide-bodied as she is tall
and slim. And frequently tempted by food. "I always felt huge as a young
person," says Oller, 59, "and that stayed with me."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years her bestseller has been a card titled "Happily Dying of
Chocolate." Her inspiration? "Me, myself."</TE>
<TE>   Another card shows a couple on a bench, their eyes on an aging woman
with flaming red hair and sagging breasts in a mini-dress that exposes
her bird legs. The caption: "Sixty Years in Sixties Dress." Says Oller:
"I always knew it would come to this."</TE>
<TE>   Her figures are not chic, highbrow or "people belonging to clubs," she
says. "I feel for people on the outside."</TE>
<TE>   An avid reader, she visualizes scenes from the books of some of her
favorite authors, William Faulkner among them. "In one card, I have this
guy who's sort of a redneck hunched over with his shotgun, and he's on
the porch with his woman."</TE>
<TE>   Ignorant poor whites inspiring greeting card mirth? In Oller's cosmos,
everything seems possible. Everything but escape.</TE>
<TE>   I shift uncomfortably on the sofa. Big Dog is back, and this time he's
eyeing me.</TE>
<TE>   Hallmark is only one of almost 2,000 card publishers that operate in
the United States. Yet this Mt. Rushmore of personal greetings is so
synonymous with the industry that it's spoofed on the Internet by a Web
site titled "Hallmark Cards you'll never see." Sample: "Happy vasectomy!"</TE>
<TE>   If not blue-haired oldies, it's other forms of atrophy I expect when
arriving at Hallmark's headquarters in Kansas City--famous for its
graceful residential neighborhoods, beef and a pair of declining sports
franchises. It's a cautious community, pleasant enough, but about as
avant-garde as Oller's mini-dress matron. You get the picture: Kansas
City hip, a staff trying desperately to appear cutting edge while
fighting back decay.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the opposite is true. The Hallmark crowd is eclectic, its
creative staff (50 writers and 50 editors) having converged here from all
points like desert nomads at an oasis. The present staff is thick with
"formers." There's a former nun, a former minister, a former stand-up
comic. Thirty-year veteran Ed Wallerstein prepped for card writing by
getting a bachelor's in engineering. Jim Howard was a "poet on food
stamps" before joining Hallmark 26 years ago, and is now a screenwriter
with a movie. Chris Conti is a former traveling salesman and carpenter.
Renee Duvall worked in a Hallmark card shop. Linda Elrod is a former
journalist, English teacher and secretary.</TE>
<TE>   This variety just barely extends to racial makeup. One of the staff's
few African Americans is 36-year-old Lisa Langford, a former actress and
L.A. resident with a Harvard B.A. in modern European history. She
answered an Internet ad a couple of years ago that persuaded her to
exchange life as a struggling actress in the city of gridlock and palm
trees for a Hallmark moment in the Midwest. "I wanted to have a regular
check, a home and some kind of security. I wanted to stop dieting. I
wanted to stop talking in front of people who judge me."</TE>
<TE>   Langford finds Kansas City to be less friendly to blacks than Los
Angeles. But the trade-off she anticipated--boredom--never happened. She
too expected a Hallark staff dominated by "little blue-haired old ladies
pecking away at typewriters." Surprise. "I have never met a single group
of people so diverse and absolutely out of their minds. That's what makes
the contrast between Kansas City and L.A. bearable. I can walk over (to
colleagues) and be amused."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Hallmark progress report said: "Lisa has a soulful voice all
her own." Langford would add "sassy [and] quirky." How sassy and quirky?
On the cover of a striking Valentine's card in Hallmark's Mahogany line,
targeting black consumers, is a photo of five swell-looking African
American men. Inside, Langford writes:</TE>
<TE>   Oooh!</TE>
<TE>   How I love a Black man</TE>
<TE>   on my mind!</TE>
<TE>   Just the thought</TE>
<TE>   sends chills down my spine:</TE>
<TE>   Around-the-way boo</TE>
<TE>   or Mr. Uptown,</TE>
<TE>   High-toned Redbone</TE>
<TE>   to deep luscious brown</TE>
<TE>   Those beautiful</TE>
<TE>   Brothas</TE>
<TE>   just stay on my mind!</TE>
<TE>   Off-the-hook style,</TE>
<TE>   unique by design:</TE>
<TE>   'Bout it 'bout it cornrows</TE>
<TE>   and conscious dreds</TE>
<TE>   Corporate fade</TE>
<TE>   or goatees with bald heads.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful, talented,</TE>
<TE>   oh how they shine!</TE>
<TE>   No wonder my Brothas</TE>
<TE>   just stay on my mind.</TE>
<TE>   Where does the actress find her applause now? "I'm so corny," Langford
says. "I go into Hallmark stores and look for my cards."</TE>
<TE>   Langford's verse extolling the "brothas" is printed with her byline,
an unusual occasion at Hallmark. But as Ed Wallerstein explains: "You
always remember the cards you write." It's impossible to forget at
Hallmark, where the writers and artists mount their favorite creations in
their cubicles like trophies.</TE>
<TE>   The brevity is alluring for some of the writers. "It's 25 words or
less," says Wallerstein, "not like trying to write a book." Or the
screenplay for "Big Bad Love," an independent film released earlier this
year that Jim Howard co-wrote with his brother, actor Arliss Howard. It's
his first screenwriting credit, and has in common with greeting cards
"the weather of the human heart," says the 45-year-old native of
Independence, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   One of Howard's "son birthday" verses is a favorite among some
staffers. Howard, whose oldest son is 20, wrote it five years ago after
being inspired by a photo of a boy running along a fence. The verse's
ending: "And one day while I wasn't looking--a blink of an eye--you just
jumped the fence into manhood, an adult with a life completely your own."</TE>
<TE>   A more primal version of parental contact is under discussion in a
colorful conference room where 10 writers, artists and designers, ages 31
to 50, are gathered around a table, ready to playfully exorcise their
demons.</TE>
<TE>   The hour of brainstorming is free-wheeling; the topic, "son birthday"
for Hallmark's mainstream Classic line. With editorial director Carolyn
Esberg, 42, marking down ideas on a big board, the group tosses out
examples of "things that parents do that really bother their sons."</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to use hip language," someone says.</TE>
<TE>   Esberg: "Can you give me an example?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, using words like hip."</TE>
<TE>   "Making generalizations, like you're always doing this, you never do
that."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're grown and you hear that coat thing, too. You're going out
without a hat? You'll catch your death."</TE>
<TE>   "The invasion of privacy. We had only one bathroom, so my mom would
walk in on you and say, 'You don't have anything I haven't seen before.'
"</TE>
<TE>   "Watch 'Everybody Loves Raymond.' The little digs. They sound like a
compliment but they're an insult."</TE>
<TE>   Esberg: "The backhanded compliment."</TE>
<TE>   "And parent predictions. Someday you're gonna be interested in girls,
and you're gonna want that money to take them out."</TE>
<TE>   Esberg: "The whole idea is forgive us, we can't stop being parents.
That sounds promising."</TE>
<TE>   On they go, until someone comes up with the best idea yet: "We should
all take up a collection for therapy."</TE>
<TE>   As I'm often reminded at home, cards can be their own therapy. Take
Fresh Ink, the relatively new Hallmark line whose passionate editorial
director is 33-year-old Conti, a goateed poet in T-shirt and blue jeans
who was inspired to write by the verses of Robert Frost.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh Ink sells especially well at college bookstores. The typical
buyer is female, age 18 to 39, well-educated and turned off by
traditional cards. A card written by DeeAnn Stewart catches my eye; the
front is a period photo of one elderly woman speaking to another on a
park bench. The caption reads: "Is it 'butt naked' or 'buck naked'?"
Inside it continues: "These are the kinds of questions I come to you
for."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking the obscure tongue of card marketing, Conti talks about
"emotional sharability," envisioning how "butt naked" vs. "buck naked"
may seduce a potential Fresh Ink buyer. "She's a young woman standing at
the rack and looking at those cards. She picks up this one. She sees
these two old women. She thinks to herself, 'This will be my friend and
me in 50 years.' "</TE>
<TE>   In a cubicle on another floor, 52-year-old Linda Elrod, who believes
in aliens and life on other planets, says she sharpens her ear for
dialogue by watching TV. She cites as an inspiration "24," the Fox series
starring Kiefer Sutherland as a tough federal agent named Jack Bauer.
"He's no wimp. So I'm gonna pretend I'm Jack writing this card to his
wife."</TE>
<TE>   If only Elrod's fellow writer in an ajoining cubicle could look to a
TV he-man for guidance. "Here's my challenge," says Renee Duvall, 42,
facing frustrating card-writer's block over Mother's Day 2003. Like
Elrod, she's assigned to write a $5.99 card that a husband would send to
his wife. "We like to think people buying $5.99 cards like a lot of
words," Duvall says. "But I think the way men communicate is different
than the way women communicate. So if this guy's gonna plunk down six
bucks, it can't go on and on. That's the challenge." If this were a
Father's Day card to be sent by a wife, Duvall says, "I could gas on
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Loots joined Hallmark at 20, and 35 years later, she's a
company superstar known as the "Queen of Hearts" whose sentimental cards
sell big year after year. "I'm fresh on the trends, fresh on the feelings
that are timeless," she explains. "The only things that change are the
circumstances of life. It's speeded up, you're busier than ever,
relationships have changed. So how do cards address these relationships
that were hardly acknowledged 35 years ago?"</TE>
<TE>   Nourished by religion, Loots is a devout Christian who also writes
spiritual cards. But she insists that she takes her cues on relationships
from TV's "Hollywood Squares." "The humor, the trivia and the repartee
they have tell you a lot about the culture," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Loots earned her Queen of Hearts title because of her Valentine's
cards. If you want a challenge, try picturing a devotee of "Hollywood
Squares" writing this:</TE>
<TE>   Before we were married,</TE>
<TE>   I knew we'd be friends--</TE>
<TE>   I've been falling in love ever after.</TE>
<TE>   We've loved through the better</TE>
<TE>   and lived through the worse.</TE>
<TE>   We've thrived on sweet kisses and laughter.</TE>
<TE>   I've felt from the start</TE>
<TE>   so fulfilled and content</TE>
<TE>   as your lover, your partner,</TE>
<TE>   your wife . . .</TE>
<TE>   And I know in my heart</TE>
<TE>   that the best part of all is</TE>
<TE>   I married my best friend for life.</TE>
<TE>   How long did it take Loots to write that? "All my life."</TE>
<TE>   "The greeting card writer knows how to convey a feeling of trust,
empathy, love, all of these human emotions," says book editor Shirl
Thomas. "You don't have to be skilled at writing. You have to like people
and care."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas speaks with authority. She's working on her own book on card
writing, drawn from 14 years of freelancing for numerous companies. She
writes occasionally while teaching aspiring card writers in her Fountain
Valley home. Her students range from homemakers to doctors and lawyers,
from ages 16 to 90.</TE>
<TE>   Her message to aspiring freelancers: abandon your get-rich-quick
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Hallmark says its writers earn from $30,000 annually for newcomers
right out of school to "up to six figures" for those with the company at
least 25 years. They are, however, the industry's wealthy class. (The
company receives 1,200 applicants for staff writing jobs every year, but
turnover is minimal.)</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone can make a living freelancing," says Thomas, who
estimates that few of the nation's thousands of freelance card writers
make even $5,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   As Janie DeVos is learning. The former homemaker and advertising
executive has been through two years of "very, very slim" earnings while
writing for three card makers that accept up 25% of what she submits. "My
husband just started his own company, so we need to sell cards now," she
says from her home in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Some card makers ask that writers create verse to match artwork.
Others do the reverse, as in one set of lines that DeVos sold with no
knowledge of the visual: "The difference you've made in my life would
take a lifetime to explain. I'd rather take a lifetime showing you."</TE>
<TE>   Although freelancers are paid up to $450 per card, she generally takes
in about half that, says DeVos, 43, who writes daily in her loft. "I say,
OK, God, I need words. And then I start writing." Not always is the
Almighty in a giving mood. The yield: "If I write five verses that I
like, that's a good day," says DeVos, a recovering alcoholic who
specializes in "philosophical stuff."</TE>
<TE>   DeVos began pursuing this Holy Grail of card writing by reading books
and articles, taking an online Internet course and assembling a portfolio
of verses that she submitted to companies. The first one she composed, a
birthday card, was rejected. But when she finally made a sale--for
$25--she remembers the pumped-up feeling: "I'm in!" Not in big money,
though. Although DeVos has her own company, called Rainy Day Creations,
and a children's book ("How High Can You Fly?") coming out in July, the
struggle continues.</TE>
<TE>   The good news? Her hair is not blue.</TE>

<HD>Lunch With Spalding Gray</HD>
<DH>The Monologuist/Actor Returns to the City of '35-mph
Consciousness,' Glad for the Sunlight but Anxious About Its Toll on His
Psyche.</DH>

<LD>Spalding Gray feels regret.</LD>
<LD>   He says this on a breezy spring afternoon while having lunch outside
Figtree's Cafe at Venice Beach. Gray, the 61-year-old actor and
monologuist, has come to Los Angeles to perform and, as always, he is
drawn to the sea because it relaxes him and provides an opportunity to
walk rather than drive. He prefers a pedestrian perspective. In Los
Angeles, he once said, the mind-set is a "35-mph consciousness," meaning
that Angelenos couldn't properly register anything not moving that fast.
He voiced this observation a dozen years ago in his "Monster in a Box"
monologue while artist-in-residence at the Mark Taper Forum.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the performers providing the backdrop to our conversation on
the Venice boardwalk have been here for years, he notes. Hari, the
Kundalini yogi-attired, guitar-playing roller-blader, remains a moving
fixture on this concrete. The boardwalk reminds Gray of his beloved
Washington Square Park in New York City. In a strange bicoastal exchange,
he recounts how he was surprised to discover that a flame-swallowing
performer, appropriately called The Fireman, disappeared from the Village
for months only to resurface on the Venice boardwalk during Gray's
residence in Southern California in the late 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   Gray grew up in coastal Rhode Island and now lives in Sag Harbor on
Long Island, so it comes as little surprise that the sand and waves
provide an antidote to the anxiety that runs through his life and work.
This anxiety seems particularly acute since last summer, when he was
involved in a near-fatal car crash in Ireland. Gray's wife, Kathie, was
driving him and a group of friends home after dinner when their car was
struck by a veterinarian assistant's van in the rural area of Westmeath,
west of Dublin. Gray suffered a fractured skull, broken hip and nerve
damage to his leg. While he usually has difficulty offering anyone
advice, he would recommend that people always wear their seat belts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange, but this one time I didn't use it," he says. "I always
use the seat belt in the back of taxis in New York." Gray was riding in
the back seat and received injuries far more severe than the other
occupants. "I'm going through this strong period of regret now. I'm
worried that some unconscious part is doing it to myself, is demolishing
my happiness. And the accident was something that was on some level
carelessness in the sense of me not wearing my seat belt. So I regret
that. I can't get to a place where I'm angry at the man who hit me
because I'm still blaming myself."</TE>
<TE>   Gray was taken to a country hospital. "Where were all the Irish
doctors?" he wondered as his Pakistani doctors suggested that he remain
in traction for six weeks and administered morphine. As the drugs waned
and the intense pain returned, Gray agonized over the right word for what
he might be feeling. Depression seemed too run-of-the-mill, so he
mentioned to the nurse that he might be feeling, using a polite Yankee
term, "a bit blue."</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you be blue, Mr. Gray?" the nurse replied. "You Americans
are too health conscious. An Irishman wouldn't give it a second thought
that he's had this accident."</TE>
<TE>   Gray remembers the hospital being full of Irishmen who seemed to have
been in car accidents. He also recalls that they were fond of talking on
their cellular phones all day long. It was not an easy place to rest and
recuperate. His attempts at getting some healthier food than the
institutional fare proved too much for the nurse. One day she walked in
while Gray was having some greens that someone had brought him as a
snack.</TE>
<TE>   "Eating spinach out of a bag?" she exclaimed. "Now I've really seen it
all!"</TE>
<TE>   "My other bit of advice," Gray confides, "is that you should travel
with an American Express Platinum Card that pays for you to medevac out
of a foreign country if you're injured."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt culture shock is a strange sensation for a man who has
traveled to the ends of the earth to discover who he is and where he's
from. When Gray first managed a proper vacation, his mother committed
suicide. While she permeates much of his work, and often informs his
sense of regret, the master of primal narcissistic nonfiction tried to
write a novel from the most painful part of his origins. Published in
1992, it is called "Impossible Vacation."</TE>
<TE>   "Steven Soderbergh said my character in his film ['Gray's Anatomy,'
1996] was ruled by regret. It's frightening because he had read
'Impossible Vacation' and said that the character in that was ruled by
regret.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with regret is that it keeps you from living in the
present."</TE>
<TE>   To complicate matters, Gray's return to Los Angeles this spring was
part of an anniversary tour of his best-known monologue, "Swimming to
Cambodia"; it describes his experiences in Southeast Asia while acting in
Roland Joffe's award-winning 1984 film "The Killing Fields." He has found
it difficult to revisit such an older work when he's trying to come to
terms with recent events and would like to begin developing these
thoughts into a new monologue. He doesn't have a title for it yet, which
he fears may be a bad sign, but it may be his funniest work to
date--judging by portions that he incorporated into an introduction to
his March performance of "Swimming to Cambodia."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, since he first performed "Swimming to Cambodia" in
1986, the film's Academy Award-winning Cambodian actor Haing Ngor was
killed in a 1996 robbery outside his home in downtown Los Angeles. Gray
remembers how different Ngor was from the other cast members, many of
whom had to be flown from their new homes in Long Beach to the film
location in Thailand because the Khmer Rouge had killed almost all of the
actors who remained in Cambodia. While many of the refugees were cautious
and fearful to tell their stories, Ngor had a palpable anger and could
speak passionately about the atrocities and hardships he and his people
had endured.</TE>
<TE>   When Gray came to Los Angeles in the 1980s to develop his show "L.A.:
The Other" that would later become part of "Monster in a Box," Gray hoped
to interview residents who weren't involved in the entertainment
industry. Among those he spoke with were Cambodian refugees in Long
Beach, and the experience reminded him of how protective and private they
were. When one woman complained about the way people drive in L.A., she
approached him after the interview and asked that he not use any of their
taped conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The person who made the strongest impression was an elderly Japanese
American named Raymond Hirai. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was
4, and he still lived in the downtown neighborhood where he grew up. He
and his family were put in an internment camp at Santa Anita Park during
World War II. Later, Hirai's main source of income was winnings from bets
placed on races at Santa Anita. His secret was to go into the paddocks
and look the horses in the eye. He won thousands of dollars but said that
some days he would lose intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   "He called it 'throwing fish back into the sea,' " Gray says. "I asked
him how he felt safe traveling in his skid row neighborhood with all that
money, and he just grabbed me here," Gray says, indicating the fleshy
skin between his thumb and forefinger. "And I collapsed to the floor" in
pain. He regrets that he never accepted Hirai's invitation to accompany
him to the racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   Gray kept finding that everyone in L.A. had some connection to the
entertainment industry. Even Hirai mentioned meeting Charlie Chaplin and
being friends with William Holden. Some simply lied about their Hollywood
aspirations. A waitress at Canter's Deli insisted she had nothing to do
with the film business. As Gray prepared to leave, she handed him a
script she'd written.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a killer-whale love story," he says, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   as we finish lunch, an odd-looking couple parades down the boardwalk.
The blond man resembles Benny Hill and is dressed in a red velvet robe
and wears a gold crown. The overweight woman is in a turquoise gown that
looks more like a fairy godmother's outfit. They wave regally at the
passersby and then take out a video camera and film themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think they're tourists?" Gray asks.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers that driving is one of the most unpleasant aspects of
living in Los Angeles and recalls the one-hour round-trip journey he made
two times a week from his house in Los Feliz to a psychoanalyst in
Century City. (After a performance of "Monster in a Box" in Washington,
D.C., years ago, a representative from a national mental health
organization called to ask if he'd serve as their national spokesperson
because she'd "never heard anyone so articulate about their mental
illness." He declined.)</TE>
<TE>   Gray says the therapy was a highlight of his time in California,
except for the commute. "I'd have a breakthrough. But then I'd have to
get back into the car and drive for a half-hour. Since I do some of my
best writing after a session, I'd lose the energy of the material by the
time I got home."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he enjoyed acting in Los Angeles, at least he did before the
accident, which has made him hesitant to travel because he still requires
physical therapy. His extended guest run in the '90s as Dr. Jack Miller
on the CBS sitcom "The Nanny" was particularly enjoyable. Last year he
appeared in the hip-hop movie "How High" and the romantic comedy "Kate &amp;
Leopold."</TE>
<TE>   Gray lowers his sunglasses so he can get some light to help with his
seasonal affective disorder. Sunlight is an advantage that Los Angeles
has over New York, he says, but he finds that the weather has its
downside as well: "Too much sun and the lack of the seasons. I just about
had a nervous breakdown when I lived out here."</TE>
<TE>   As we watch the foot traffic, Gray describes how the local car culture
keeps people from interacting. He calls them "vicarians."</TE>
<TE>   The wind is picking up now and Gray regrets that he didn't bring a
sweater. He's worried he might catch a cold, a condition that could have
been serious only months before, when his sinus cavity was fractured in
the accident. He's concerned that getting sick would prevent him from
performing. He has no understudy. That's the unique challenge of a
one-man show.</TE>

<HD>Poor Man's Orchid</HD>
<DH>Epidendrums Don't Cost a Fortune, and Even the Novice Gardener Will
Find Them Forgiving</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among noble orchids, which can demand months of misting, feeding
and fussing before their blooms appear like gaudy queens in stiff gowns,
reed-stem epidendrums are the proletarians--the noisy, penniless cousins
who keep showing up en masse, cheerfully looking for the party. In fact,
the "poor man's orchid," the commonest of its common names, evokes just
this humble charm: Compared to other orchids, epidendrums are not
expensive. They're not exclusive. In Los Angeles, they blossom outdoors
nearly year-round in teeming hordes with minimal care. Though they flower
most from spring to fall, December still finds clouds of them in Bill
Marshall's Pacific Palisades garden. Which is why, nearly 40 years ago,
he blew off cymbidiums and went epidendrum-wild.</LD>
<LD>   On a deck outside his living room, edging a broad, flat ocean view,
clutches of red, orange, gold and violet blooms sway in the breeze: the
two-toned Epidendrum radicans, the fiery 'Notre d'Or,' 'Maili Pink,'
'Kauai Streaks,' and others he knows only as 'Red,' 'Lavender' and
'Fuchsia.' "The common types have been crossed so many times you don't
necessarily know what you're getting," says Marshall, a retired salesman
of fiberoptic telecommunications systems who has given years of his
leisure to "epi's," as he and other devotees call them. Generally, he
notes, the plants are sold by color. Novel bloom shades also arise
naturally in his garden with its busy pollinating hummingbirds.</LD>
<TE>   In the tropical Americas, from South Carolina down to Argentina,
nearly 900 epidendrum species grow wild, in settings ranging from
sea-level woodlands to lofty meadows, humid jungles and cloud forests.
Their name, which derives from a Greek word meaning "on a tree,"
describes their tendency to sprout in forked trunks and other high spots,
and to take their nourishment from the air. But they're content in
gardens, too, doing best, in Marshall's view, when grown in pots, where
it's easy to meet their needs.</TE>
<TE>   To get the most copious blooms, start with strong plants, he advises.
Look for vigorous stems, uniformly green leaves and robust roots that
might be breaking the soil surface or poking through a pot's drainage
holes. Don't be a snob about sources. One of Marshall's pets--a
floriferous salmon-pink plant--was a grocery store find. He has spotted
other treasures at farmers' markets and Home Depot. "If you know what
plants need, they'll thrive," he says. But they might even if you don't.
"These guys are forgiving," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   All orchids need lots of air around their roots, he explains. Their
preferred potting soil is open and fast-draining--a blend, say, that's
half bark chips, a quarter perlite and the rest high-quality, organic
commercial planting mix. Epi's will, however, accept a wide variety of
soils, simply "heaving up," or baring their thick white roots, faster if
the medium is too heavy. Likewise, though it's recommended, you don't
have to feed them. The organic compost in Marshall's potting mix gives
his plants a strong start. He only fertilizes those he takes to orchid
shows, using an all-purpose, balanced food at half-strength once a week
from spring through fall. "Without food, epi's bloom and bloom well," he
notes. "But if you feed them, wow!"</TE>
<TE>   Less negotiable is sun. They want hours of it, morning and/or
afternoon. (Just be careful in summer heat that their leaves don't burn;
spritz often to keep them cool; and in hot valleys, grow plants in
part-shade.) Water weekly, protect plants from frost (more than a night
or two may kill them) and cut them back when they get ratty. Marshall
admits, "They're not pretty if you let them go." Spent flower spikes will
splay like straws, roots push up everywhere, and old and new stems
compete for space with offshoots called keikis--Hawaiian for
baby--piggybacking on mother stalks. To avoid this mess, clip spent
stalks to their second ring-mark above the soil. When keikis come off
easily in your hand, detach them and pot them and they will bloom within
a year. Repot mother plants when they become unsightly. Watch for pests,
especially aphids and spider mites, both of which can be controlled with
horticultural soap or by spraying with water.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, whose epi collection once exceeded 1,000 plants, has
recently cut back to a few hundred, which spill down from his deck into
a lath house, with more pots parked along his hillside paths. Sitting
alone in its own bed on a lower terrace, his prize mother plant, E.
elongatum 'Jacques,' which has been in constant bloom for 30 years, rises
six feet above its pot. It produces at least 100 keikis a year, and while
Marshall allots some for garden club charity sales, he gives most away to
friends. Such generosity is so common among epi growers that over time,
he says, the plant is losing its "poor-man's" designation: "More and
more, it's just called the friendship orchid."</TE>

<HD>Throw Your Bobolis to the Birds and Impress Your Guests with
Homemade Pizza Crust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE GREEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are certain foods most of us never prepare at home because
they're more trouble than they're worth, particularly since we can buy
them ready-made. Ice cream, ravioli, tamales. High on the list is pizza,
due mainly to that pesky dough. The contemporary American isn't fond of
recipes that say things like "allow to rise for two hours" or
"refrigerate overnight." Nor does the thought of kneading hold much joy
for anyone but a massage therapist. Why wrestle with a yeast ball when
for $12 you can get a stranger in a beater car with a lighted sign on the
roof to deliver a perfectly good pizza to your door?</LD>
<LD>   That certainly was my attitude until I discovered that making pizza
dough is a snap and the result is a crowd-pleaser. True, frozen pizzas
have come a long way in the past decade, and prefab crusts offer the
illusion of pizza-making for the harried and the dough-a-phobic. But
these options impress no one and permit none of the smug satisfaction
that comes of baking a pie from scratch. I say fling your frozen Pucks
discus-style into the soft night air and kiss your Boboli goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   Hands-on labor for dough requires 20 minutes tops--half that if you
have a bread machine or a food processor. The only catch is that you have
to plan ahead, since dough needs at least an hour or so to rise. Make it
at your convenience and let it rise on its own time: Refrigerated dough
rises despite the chill and keeps for a week.</LD>
<TE>   It's the toppings, not the dough, that can make pizza labor-intensive.
When rushed you can utilize commercially prepared items such as bottled
sauce, shredded mozzarella and sliced mushrooms, and no one will be the
wiser. Your signature creation, the one loaded with Thai chicken, grits,
croutons, Velveeta cheese, fava beans and licorice, can always wait for a
more leisurely occasion.</TE>
<TE>   The dough itself could hardly be simpler. Cookbook and Internet
recipes abound, but most pizza dough consists of just five ingredients:
yeast, flour, salt, water and olive oil. Some also contain a sweetener,
usually sugar or honey, but that's it. Anything else is superfluous.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing pizza dough is a forgiving art, but you would never know it
from the strict and often misleading advice found in recipes. A
500-degree oven isn't necessary (450 degrees will do), dry yeast doesn't
need to be proofed, the water doesn't have to be between 105 and 110
degrees, pizza stones aren't essential for crispness, and dough doesn't
have to rise twice or live in an airtight glass bowl or be refrigerated
overnight to produce excellent crust.</TE>
<TE>   I've yet to find a recipe that reveals the best tip of all: If you
roll your dough on parchment cooking paper, you can slide the paper and
pizza directly onto an oven rack and bake perfect crust without a pan.
And what the heck, here's a helpful corollary: If the whole thing
ignites, that's not parchment cooking paper you're using.</TE>
<TE>Thin-Crust Pizza Dough</TE>
<TE>   Makes two 12-inch pizzas</TE>
<TE>   1 cup warm water</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   2 3/4 to 3 cups bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Combine water, sugar, yeast and 1 1/2 cup flour in a large bowl and
mix well. Add the oil, salt, and remaining flour. Stir until you can no
longer work the dough with a spoon. Knead for five minutes, adding small
amounts of water or flour if necessary to achieve dough that is moist but
not overly sticky. Let rise for one hour in lightly oiled bowl covered
with towel or plastic wrap.</TE>
<TE>   Divide into two equal portions. Cover with towel and let rest for 10
minutes before rolling to 1/4-inch thickness. Add your favorite toppings.
(For a classic Margherita pizza, top with 2 cups sliced Roma tomatoes, 8
ounces sliced mozzarella, 8-10 fresh basil leaves and salt and pepper to
taste.) Bake on an upper rack at 450 degrees, for 8-10 minutes or until
crust is golden. (If using a bread machine or food processor, follow
manufacturer's directions.)</TE>

<LD>A few weeks ago, I called a friend who had been working for months
without a break and proposed a spur-of-the-moment get-away. "You drive,
I'll buy dinner," I told him. I let slip the destination: Buellton. "The
home of Andersen pea soup?" he asked, with a
maybe-I-won't-be-taking-that-vacation-after-all tone.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not what you're thinking," I hastened to explain. "I want to
take you to a cowboy steakhouse for some great Santa Maria barbecue."</LD>
<LD>   "Well, then, agreed."</LD>
<TE>   From Los Angeles, the sleepy little town at the edge of the Santa Ynez
wine country is just over two hours on 101 north. The restaurant is The
Hitching Post II, a descendant of the Santa Maria-style barbecue
restaurant in Casmalia founded by Frank and Natalie Ostini in 1952 and
still run by their children. A son, Frank Ostini, opened the Buellton
steakhouse  in 1986 and turned this Hitching Post into a Central Coast
hangout for food and wine lovers.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrive, we manage to get the last remaining spot at the very
back of the dirt parking lot. We breathe in the scent of eucalyptus, pine
and, unmistakably, a trace of horse manure. This is cowboy country, after
all. Under a darkening sky, we stroll toward the front, the smells of red
oak and charred beef wafting from the kitchen suddenly making us
ravenous.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of the constant upgrade, it's pleasant  to find the place
hasn't changed since I last was here. It looks like what it is: the best
dinner house in a laid-back country town. You won't see its light
fixtures featured in the next issue of Dwell or Metropolitan Home. The
walls get the old-fashioned treatment--wallpaper--punctuated with framed
black-and-white photos of local cowpokes on horseback. In the foyer, a
posse of locals visit goodnaturedly as they wait for tables, checking to
see if any spots have opened up at the bar, where Ostini is holding
court.</TE>
<TE>   As we thread our way toward the bar, I spy two young couples on their
way to the prom. They look adorable. One of the guys is wearing a black
Stetson and chic nerdy glasses; the other sports a boutonniere and sleek
tuxedo. A waitress rushes in, calling out, "Miss, you forgot your purse."
As she holds out a minute petal-pink number, a girl in a matching satin
dress turns, giggling, to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   On the front of the menu, Ostini is listed as chef and winemaker. Not
many restaurants can boast their own winemaker. For 10 years, Ostini and
his winemaking partner, commercial fisherman Gray Hartley, were tenants
at Au Bon Climat winery in Santa Maria Valley. Last year, the two began
renting a larger facility nearby, where they make The Hitching Post
wines. They don't own any land. Instead, they buy grapes, some from the
famous Bien Nacido and Sanford &amp; Benedict vineyards. Last vintage, they
made seven different Pinot Noirs.</TE>
<TE>   You can taste several current releases at the bar and buy bottles
retail to take home, with a 20% discount if you buy by the case. The
markups aren't high. Their top Pinot Noir, the 1999 Highliner, for
example, is $50 on the wine list, $40 to take home.</TE>
<TE>   The menu isn't very big, but then it doesn't have to be. What it
offers is honest food at honest prices. Everybody gets a complimentary
relish plate, something I haven't seen since I was a kid. Nostalgic or
not, it's amazing how good a carrot or celery stick can taste salted and
chilled in ice. I also love that it's served with packaged crackers.</TE>
<TE>   Every entree comes with shrimp cocktail or soup, salad and your choice
of baked potato, fries or rice pilaf. (A "lite" option eliminates the
shrimp cocktail course for a discount of $2.) The cocktail is a heap of
pretty rock shrimp in a spunky horseradish-laced cocktail sauce. The
night's chicken-and-vegetable soup is more of a chicken chowder in a
tomato-tinged broth. The salad, too, is perfectly fine, and the Thousand
Island dressing isn't too sweet.</TE>
<TE>   I always end up ordering too much food because I won't give up
favorite a la carte appetizers. Steamed artichokes are finished off on
the grill. Smoky and charred at the edge, they're fantastic alone or
dipped into a gutsy roasted tomato-ancho chile mayonnaise. Glossy black
Santa Barbara mussels are steamed in beer and served with plenty of
juices to waltz your bread through. If you're partial to little birds,
get the juicy grilled California quails.</TE>
<TE>   The main event, though, is the beef sizzling on the Santa Maria-style
grill, a massive iron affair with chains that lower the grate over the
red oak fire. The beef is Midwestern corn-fed Black Angus, and, in this
style of barbecue, it's basted with oil and vinegar to keep from drying
out. The cooks also step up the flavor with what Ostini calls his magic
dust, which includes a little onion, garlic, three kinds of pepper and
less salt than the traditional Santa Maria 'cue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the steaks--top sirloin, New York, filet mignon--can be
ordered in two or three sizes. The T-bone is a 20-ouncer. With the
exception of the filet mignon and the flatiron cut, he keeps prices down
by not serving prime. That doesn't mean the steaks aren't full of flavor.
They're also as perfectly cooked as any steak I've ever had.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all steak here, though. Sometimes there's a massive prime rib
chop. There's also a wonderful cold-smoked pork loin from Salmon Creek
Farms that's marinated and grilled whole. And meaty pork baby back ribs
with a lovely overlay of smoke are served six days a week.</TE>
<TE>   The menu always includes a fish special--and ostrich. Yes, ostrich are
raised around here. The meat comes from the leg, and it's red, just like
steak. It chews like steak, too, but lacks the fat that makes marbled
beef speak so compellingly to our genes.</TE>
<TE>   Take a night off from calorie-counting to enjoy the terrific fries.
Deep gold and shatteringly crisp on the outside, they're light and fluffy
inside. The secret? The potatoes are blanched and then fried twice--in
beef fat. Try them with The Hitching Post's special cru of ketchup mixed
with Pepper Plant, a vinegary local hot sauce.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, if you make it that far, they have a tall, fine-textured
cheesecake with a tart raspberry sauce that tastes intensely of ripe
berries.</TE>
<TE>   The Hitching Post has it all--a lively atmosphere, personable service,
really good food and interesting wines from a hands-on
owner-chef-winemaker. Worth making the drive? Absolutely.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Gives Cops a Refresher Course on Ethics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL WEISSERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>MEXICO CITY -- Imagine a businessman in a black BMW convertible
running a red light and being stopped by a motorcycle cop.</LD>
<LD>   As the officer comes to the window, the driver, without even
pausing from his cell phone conversation, hands over a 50-peso bill
worth about $5.</LD>
<LD>   "Your bribe is waiting for you," says police ethics instructor
Miguel Alcartar, describing the all-too-common scenario to Marcos
Perez of Mexico City's motorcycle patrol. "In the past you probably
would have taken it. The driver expects you to now. What do you do?"</LD>
<TE>   Perez doesn't hesitate. "As a motorcycle officer of the Federal
District, I would brush off his money and write him an infraction,"
he yells triumphantly, stomping his foot for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   "Give him a hand!" Alcartar tells the class of 100 motorcycle
police. "When you leave here that's the choice you will all make."</TE>
<TE>   Officers have rarely exhibited such enthusiastic honesty on the
chaotic streets of Mexico City, where police corruption is rampant
and motorcycle officers are often viewed as the most corrupt of all.</TE>
<TE>   Things are so bad that the city's Public Safety Department
recently ordered its 815-strong motorcycle force off the streets,
banishing officers for more than two months of training in ethics,
human rights and public relations.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 100 of Mexico City's finest failed city physicals,
academy officials added two hours of daily calisthenics, as well as
periodic drug tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them had become corrupt and overweight and were using
cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana," said Juan Torres, the academy's
director. "They had lost sight of their goals and had forgotten their
self-respect."</TE>
<TE>   The retraining program is the latest in a seemingly endless series
of police cleanups that have seen thousands of officers across Mexico
fired for corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City officials have tried installing cameras at
intersections to spy on police and bringing in soldiers to direct
traffic. For several months in 1999, only female officers were
allowed to write tickets, on the theory that they were more honest
than men.</TE>
<TE>   To little avail. In a recent newspaper poll, 95% of those surveyed
said the word "corruption" best characterized Mexico City's
motorcycle force. In another survey, for the Mexico branch of the
watchdog group Transparency International, more than 60% said they
had paid at least one bribe to police officers last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You are driving and suddenly there are four officers on
motorcycles behind you," said Gloria Jimenez, a 41-year-old
convenience store owner who said police target her because she drives
a new SUV. "They stop you and all of them demand a bribe even though
you haven't done anything."</TE>
<TE>   Alcartar has taught police ethics for 23 years. His classes
feature chanting, slogans and inspirational anecdotes.</TE>
<TE>   "Corruption begins simply: 20 pesos here, 100 pesos there," he
says, sketching a mountain labeled "Corruption" on the blackboard and
then tracing a path straight up its face, to a summit labeled
"Pride."</TE>
<TE>   "You never know where it's going to end," he continues. "A corrupt
police officer loses his honor but he also costs his family their
honor."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the classroom, many officers say having to feed families
on salaries averaging $440 a month fosters corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, 25, has spent three years on the force. Away from
Alcartar's watchful eyes, he says he isn't sure he would turn down a
real-life bribe.</TE>

<HD>Idle Youth Coddled by '5 Cs'</HD>
<DH>Singapore: Cars, clubs, careers, condos and credit cards
dominate life. Premier says teens must 'rediscover some of the
self-reliant spirit of earlier generations.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD HARRIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SINGAPORE--Fifteen-year-old Kalliste Oh doesn't make her bed. She
also doesn't clean her room, or iron her private-school uniforms or
straighten her 50 pairs of shoes.</LD>
<LD>   That's what her family's three Filipino maids are for, she says.</LD>
<LD>   Oh says she can't perform basic domestic duties and has never held
an after-school or summer job.</LD>
<TE>   "Whatever I need, I ask for," she says, whiling away a muggy
afternoon inside one of Singapore's air-conditioned havens for teen
consumers. "It's true, I can't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   This attitude among Singapore's first generation born into
widespread wealth is causing public hand-wringing by parents and
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore's young people are probably no more coddled than their
counterparts in other wealthy countries. The difference is that in
Singapore--a nation that has gone from Third World to First World in
a single generation--spoiled youths have popped up on the radar
screen of the country's control-obsessed leaders, who demand a say in
everything from dating to the courteous use of mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently railed against children who
"grew up with a silver spoon in their mouth, a maid at their beck and
call, and a car to bring them around." Singaporean youth, he said,
must "rediscover some of the self-reliant spirit of earlier
generations."</TE>
<TE>   Only three decades ago, Singapore's national survival seemed
unlikely after it broke away from an ill-fated two-year merger with
neighboring Malaysia. The country was a slum-ridden, malaria-infested
backwater with few natural resources, no armed forces and hostile
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Lee Kuan Yew and his ardent followers in the People's Action
Party, which has dominated Singapore politics since independence in
1965.</TE>
<TE>   Under Lee's firm rule, Singapore--whose only true resource was its
position astride one of the world's busiest shipping routes--quickly
evolved into a regional transportation, business and financial hub.</TE>
<TE>   Per capita gross domestic product for the country's 4 million
inhabitants has increased about forty-fold since independence,
reaching $20,732 in 2001, according to government figures. That
figure ranks it among the highest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Homelessness and hunger have been replaced by Hermes and Harrods.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, one in every seven families has a foreign maid, the
Ministry of Manpower says. Some, like Oh's family of eight, have
several maids to watch the children and fend off the rot and mold
endemic in this tropical climate.</TE>
<TE>   The government-linked Straits Times newspaper printed an article
titled "The Instant-Noodle Generation," featuring a survey of 104
teens. When asked how dependent they were on maids, most rated
themselves about a 7 out of 10--with 10 being completely dependent.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a new government task force called Remaking Singapore has
begun studying how to spur Singaporeans beyond the "five Cs" of
Singapore life: cars, clubs, careers, condos and credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   This consumerism is on display along Singapore's famous Orchard
Road, which rivals Paris' Place Vendome, Tokyo's Ginza or New York's
Madison Avenue for luxury products.</TE>
<TE>   Also lining Orchard Road are plazas devoted entirely to teenagers.
They're crammed with food courts, video arcades, even spas.</TE>
<TE>   In the five-story mall where Oh and her friends are waiting to see
the Hollywood movie "Bandits," the girls chat on mobile phones and
ride the escalators between floors designed as movie sets. They
cruise arcades with fancy wireless interactive games played on
high-tech gadgets. Kids in the latest fashions linger in front of the
complex, some blowing smoke rings.</TE>
<TE>   Many say these youngsters are a byproduct of Singapore's driven
society. Although they may lead easy lives, that doesn't mean they're
not also industrious, particularly in their studies, says 25-year-old
Chong Tze Chien, creator of "Spoilt," a play about a Prada-shod
Singaporean woman tormented by an existential void.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, kids are spoiled. But the word has a double meaning. Kids
work very hard in school--but then they're rewarded. And they end up
pampered," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Some say spoiled children are partially a product of Singapore's
paternalistic state apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the whole story, Chong says.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taught to have more, that more is good," he says. "We know
it's wrong, but we can't pull ourselves away from it. It's like a
drug."</TE>

<HD>Albania's Deadly Family Feuds Defy Limitation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERITA DHIMGJOKA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHKODRA, Albania</DL>
<LD>Isa Haruni wakes up each morning wondering if this day will be his
last. He and his 75 male relatives are potential targets in a
7-year-old blood feud sparked by a killing committed by a cousin.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day, I kiss my children before I leave home thinking I
might not have another chance," says the merchant, his broad
shoulders slumping and dark eyes twitching.</LD>
<LD>   Haruni, 42, and his relatives aren't the only potential victims.
Under decades of communist rule, deadly family feuds were rare in
Albania, but communism is history, and nearly everyone in Albania has
a gun. Old debts are being settled, and new blood is being shed.</LD>
<TE>   The code of revenge, known as Kanun, was first laid down nearly
600 years ago by a northern Albanian prince: If a man kills another,
a male member of the victim's family must respond in kind.</TE>
<TE>   As it did in similar lands around the world, the blood feud became
a popular form of justice in a highly armed, tribal society where
government authority was weak and a man's honor was everything. Whole
families were wiped out by feuds that sometimes lasted for
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Now, although most Albanians continue to reject Kanun, the
practice has been revived in Albania, fed by the chaos and armed
insurrection that have unsettled the country since the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have sought unsuccessfully to track down military and
police weapons that spread through the population after looting
during months of unrest in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Some private groups are working to reduce bloodletting.</TE>
<TE>   One is campaigning to modify the rules of Kanun so that only a
killer would be targeted instead of all the males in his extended
family</TE>
<TE>   Headed by Emin Spahija, the Peace Missionaries Union is
concentrating on the district of Malesija e Madhe (Great Highland),
where about 120 families are said to be engaged in feuds. Spahija
meets with hundreds of villagers every week, cajoling them to pledge
adherence to limited feuding.</TE>
<TE>   South of that district, in Shkodra, with a population of about
170,000, more than 500 families--about 2,000 people--are feuding. In
one neighborhood alone, 118 children reportedly have been left
without fathers as a result of revenge killings.</TE>
<TE>   One death is too many for other anti-feud groups, which consider
Spahija's initiative an attempt to legitimize Kanun.</TE>
<TE>   "This move is unconstitutional," asserts Rasim Gjoka, a
philosopher who works full-time for the Foundation for Conflict
Resolution, a nongovernmental group that seeks to reconcile
participants in feuds. "What it says is you're allowed to kill this
man, but not this other one."</TE>
<TE>   Spahija considers his idea pragmatic.</TE>
<TE>   "Allowing thousands of men to live their lives freely and not be
held responsible for crimes committed by their relatives, whom they
probably don't even know, is an end that justifies the means," he
argues.</TE>
<TE>   Haruni's ordeal began Jan. 21, 1995, when his drunk cousin gunned
down a 33-year-old man who had slapped and insulted him. The killing
widowed a 20-year-old woman and orphaned a 2-month-old son.</TE>
<TE>   After the killing, 75 males of Haruni's extended family began what
he calls "voluntary house arrest" to keep safe from attacks. Haruni's
second son spent the first two years of his life inside the family
house.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kanun, women, children and livestock should not be
targets in feuds, but few seem to respect it these days. Recently an
11-year-old boy was killed in Shkodra in revenge for a crime
committed by his adult cousin.</TE>
<TE>   After three years, Haruni's relatives were offered a one-year
truce by the victim's family, which guaranteed that for 12 months no
one would be killed. But the family refused to extend the truce, and
Haruni's daily flirt with death began.</TE>
<TE>   "After their refusal, we decided to go out," he says. "If none of
us would work, we would not survive anyway, because there was no food
for the family."</TE>
<TE>   Haruni doubts he will see an end to blood feuds in his lifetime.
He's not sure his children will either.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you expect of my sons who spent three years in one room
surrounded by men with guns?" he asks. "My youngest son, at the age
of 5, can already load and unload the rifle faster than I can."</TE>

<LD>   Maria de los Angeles Aguilar, matriarch of a family that includes
her 13 children and 47 grandchildren, is heartened. "It's the first
rain of the year, which is good, since we had six months with no
rain."</LD>
<LD>   A grandson, 8-year-old Manuel, passes by, showing signs of
malnutrition.</LD>
<TE>   "Before, in this place, the children grew very healthy," his
grandmother says. "Now, my children, grandchildren, are very
malnourished. What will happen with the ones who come next?"</TE>
<TE>   Almost four years after Hurricane Mitch caused widespread
destruction in the region, Central America's drought has at least
30,000 Hondurans suffering from hunger, the United Nations' World
Food Program says. A drop in world prices for coffee, Honduras'
biggest export, also is hurting the farm country, it says.</TE>
<TE>   De los Angeles works long hours with her children on a melon farm
to earn just 43 lempiras a day, less than $3. While they struggle to
make enough to buy food, her home is surrounded by empty, dusty
fields where corn used to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo Osorto is the only farmer who is working his land in this
area near the Pacific Coast. "One must plant with the hope of rain.
Without it, we have no harvest and the loss is greater," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the drought damaged 1.7 million acres of grain crops,
which make up the bulk of Hondurans' diet, and many areas are short
of drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   Resting in a hammock, 3-year-old Denis Vasquez is another child
showing evidence of lack of food. His grandfather, Saturnino Lopez,
worries about Denis and the other nine grandchildren living with him
in his humble home.</TE>
<TE>   "Many times we don't have anything to eat," he says. "None of them
can attend the school, because we don't have this to spend. If you
ask the children what they ate today, they will say, 'Nothing, with
salt.' "</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the drought, western Honduras is suffering from a 60%
decline in coffee prices since 1999. The country's 120,000 coffee
producers lost an estimated $70 million last year, and an increasing
number of people are leaving farm areas to seek work in cities.</TE>
<TE>   Natividad Enamorando, a mother of five children, ages 2 to 9, says
the going is hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been able to find employment in the last weeks, and it
is very difficult to see so many days pass by that I don't have
anything to give the children to eat," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Three of her children attend school, where they get food donated
by the World Food Program.</TE>

<HD>Romanian Cemetery Newcomers Rest in Kitsch</HD>
<DH>Europe: Historic Bellu graveyard houses the remains of
nobility, and of increasing numbers of the 'nouveaux riches' with
dubious taste.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISON MUTLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUCHAREST, Romania</DL>
<LD>First they built lavish lakeside villas. Now Romania's new rich want
to strut their prosperity in the afterlife with grandiose graves and
tony tombs.</LD>
<LD>   Mausoleums of dubious taste are rising in Bellu cemetery, the
final resting place for generations of poets and princes, and its
guardians worry that the country's grandest and most genteel
graveyard is losing its aristocratic air.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Radu Dumitru, an Orthodox priest who manages Bellu,
believes it should be turned into a national pantheon this year--its
150th anniversary--to save it from disaster.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want any more kitsch here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But money decides who gets buried in Bellu, and there are no rules
on the aesthetics of graves.</TE>
<TE>   One mausoleum built in 1997 is an exact imitation of a Greek
temple, measuring 12 feet by 12 feet. That wasn't bad in itself,
except its owner then had the whole thing encased in panels of white
glass.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a faithful copy of a temple, but the glass makes it look
like a shop," Dumitru said.</TE>
<TE>   Being buried in Bellu doesn't come cheap. To rest in perpetuity at
Bellu costs at least $1,000, and a fancy mausoleum for the whole
family can run $5,000. The nation's average monthly salary is $100.</TE>
<TE>   Viorel Catarama, a furniture magnate and politician in his 40s,
has built a large tomb that resembles a swanky boutique, complete
with a facade of black marble and brass letters above the door that
say: "Catarama Family."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Filip, a photographer who has been taking pictures of Bellu
since 1977, said it has become "a cemetery for the nouveaux riches."</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1852 for Romania's political and cultural elite, Bellu is
estimated to hold the remains of as many as 50,000 people, though
nobody knows for sure.</TE>
<TE>   The 69-acre cemetery is unkempt, with its graves squeezed tightly
together. Avenues are lined with lime trees, maples, poplars and
horse chestnuts, some more than 100 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Before the collapse of communist rule in 1989, Bellu was a popular
destination for visitors seeking a glimpse of beautiful architecture
and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Renowned poet Mihai Eminescu is buried in one of Bellu's simpler
graves, which is scattered with bouquets of violet pansies and
gnarled beeswax candles. Ornate yet gracious 19th century mausoleums
belonging to the Ghica, Sturdza and Cantacuzino princely families
display the wealth of the pre-communist aristocracy.</TE>
<TE>   But many treasures have been plundered in recent years. Filip said
thieves known as the "Cemetery Mafia" stole four copper sphinxes,
each weighing close to a ton, from the grave of a World War I hero.
Slabs of marble, bronze artifacts, and sculptures are pilfered in the
dead of night.</TE>
<TE>   Metal works of art are melted down and sold as raw material;
marble is recycled for other graves. The sculptures were stolen to
order, Filip speculated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, the wife of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
reportedly wanted to demolish most of Bellu cemetery after gold coins
were discovered in a politician's vault. Ceausescu was preoccupied
with other projects, and his wife, Elena, was never able to pursue
her hunt for more coins.</TE>
<TE>   Like Dumitru, Filip thinks there should be some control over what
kind of memorials can be built at Bellu.</TE>
<TE>   "Pride pushes people to build ostentatious graves," said Filip,
who has spent hundreds of hours photographing how daylight and
twilight play on the mausoleums.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not sure he wants to end up there himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be buried there for pride, but as Bellu's
chronicler it might be fitting," he said. "But heaven forbid I have a
kitsch grave!"</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Fight Clogs Jails Along Canadian Border</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLAINE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>A flood of federal agents arriving at the Canadian border to stop
would-be terrorists instead is catching drug smugglers and small-time
criminals, and the collars are beginning to clog the local court
systems.</LD>
<LD>   The sheriff and prosecutor in Whatcom County, in the nation's
northwestern corner, have long had to deal with what they call the
"border effect," when cases too small to interest federal prosecutors
are turned over to local jurisdictions.</LD>
<LD>   But as more border agents start making more busts, local officials
fear it's only going to get worse.</LD>
<TE>   "My jail is full," said Whatcom County Sheriff Dale Brandland.
"Police officers can't arrest people on minor misdemeanor warrants
because there's no place to put them."</TE>
<TE>   County officials are hinting that, unless they get more federal
money, they just might stop handling federal cases--a stance that
counties along the southwestern border have used to secure funding
for the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Whatcom is more susceptible than most northern counties to the
border effect. It contains the Blaine border crossing, the busiest
west of Detroit, one used to illegally transport marijuana from
British Columbia to Seattle, Portland, Ore., and California--and
cocaine north to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   About 8 million people cross the border at Blaine each year.</TE>
<TE>   Of arrests made there by federal agents, 85% to 90%--about 400 a
year--are handled by the Whatcom County prosecutor's office. Jailing,
prosecuting and providing legal help for those arrested usually costs
the county about $2.3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Dave McEachran is worried that those costs are about to
climb. Last month, President Bush signed a bill authorizing 1,600 new
immigration officers along the United States' 5,000-mile border with
Canada by 2006. That includes 100 new agents for Washington this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are starting to stagger under this load," McEachran wrote to
Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) last fall. "I believe we have been
faithful and diligent partners to the federal government for years in
this battle, and now need to have our federal partners support us
financially in this effort."</TE>
<TE>   The letter contained a barely veiled threat: When the federal
government began focusing on stemming illegal immigration from Mexico
in the 1990s, several Texas counties simply refused to handle federal
arrests until the government agreed to pay for them, McEachran noted.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Justice Department compensates those counties and others
in the Southwest for every case they handle. Texas' El Paso County,
across the border from Juarez, has received $2 million in the last 2
1/2 years, El Paso County Dist. Atty. Jaime Esparza said.</TE>
<TE>   No one is suggesting that the problem along the northern border is
that serious, and McEachran said that most border cases are better
handled by Whatcom County than at the federal level.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the county needs financial support. Whatcom County
has one drug prosecutor funded by the federal government, and one
staff member. The two positions total about $100,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than the zero assistance given to St. Clair County,
Mich., where the Blue Water Bridge links Port Huron to Sarnia,
Ontario. Joseph McCarthy Jr., the senior trial attorney in the county
prosecutor's office, said that the cases his office handles--mostly
of the drug and weapon varieties--don't pose too great a burden.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added: "Any time you increase the enforcement, you're
likely to detect larger volumes of contraband.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the bridge from my office window, and I can tell you
the semi truck traffic is barely crawling. The more thoroughly you
inspect, the more you're going to find there."</TE>
<TE>   John McKay, the U.S. attorney in Seattle, said it's unlikely that
the Justice Department will start reimbursing counties in Washington
state, but there are other things the federal government can do. One
possibility: Assign a full-time federal prosecutor, and possibly even
a federal judge, to Whatcom County.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The first night he was locked up, Calvin Ollins stood on his bed so
he could see out the window. Through the double-thick glass, the
14-year-old boy watched the snow fall and cried.</LD>
<LD>   He was scared and confused. A special-ed student who could barely
read, he had no idea of how much trouble he was in.</LD>
<LD>   The eighth-grader was being held in the rape and bludgeoning
murder of Lori Roscetti, a 23-year-old medical student. It was a
"heater" case that had put pressure on police to find the killers
fast.</LD>
<TE>   Three months after the October 1986 murder, four teens were
arrested, the youngest being Calvin Ollins.</TE>
<TE>   He repeatedly denied doing anything wrong. But he says police kept
telling him his cousin, Larry--also one of the four--had implicated
him and if he admitted his role he could go home.</TE>
<TE>   So Calvin Ollins confessed. He thought he would be returning to
his mother. When that didn't happen, he tried to recant, but it was
too late.</TE>
<TE>   He, his cousin and two others--Omar Saunders and Marcellius
Bradford--were convicted. Bradford had confessed too, but says he
implicated the others after the police beat him and he was promised a
reduced sentence.</TE>
<TE>   At his sentencing, Calvin Ollins maintained his innocence. "I want
to say that I was found guilty for something that I didn't do," he
said. "And I always tell myself that I will be out one day and that
God will do something for me."</TE>
<TE>   Ollins was sentenced to life. He served nearly 15 years--more than
half his life--before DNA tests unlocked the prison doors last
December. By then, he was a half-year shy of his 30th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "To go in as a young kid and to come out as a man--it's not easy
to accept," he says quietly. "You see all the good times you could
have had ... "</TE>
<TE>   He refuses to dwell on milestones he missed--high school, learning
to drive, dating--because, he says, "you won't be able to function
like a normal human being, and then you might as well go to the grave
being defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Kathleen Zellner calls the case "one of the greatest
frauds ever perpetrated in a Chicago courtroom."</TE>
<TE>   She has filed suit on behalf of the four men, claiming authorities
manufactured phony evidence, coerced confessions and falsified lab
test results. Police and prosecutors declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   This February, police announced two men had confessed to the
Roscetti murder, and DNA tests linked them to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   During his long years in juvenile detention and prison, Ollins
never gave up hope.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're guilty, you're not expecting anything," he says. "But
when you're innocent, you're expecting something--you don't know what
or when or how it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   It almost didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   When the Innocence Project looked into the possibility of DNA
testing, Chicago police reported that evidence had been destroyed.
But Zellner, who later took on the case, knew those materials were
stored in the clerk's warehouse and had them tested.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-nine pieces of DNA evidence cleared them.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ollins has an apartment, a car and a girlfriend, Adelle.</TE>
<TE>   He works as a paralegal for Zellner, screening letters from
inmates who claim they're innocent.</TE>
<TE>   His exuberance amazes her. "He has a complete appreciation of
every day, every moment, all the small things we all take for
granted," she says.</TE>

<HD>A Horrible Accident and Its Aftermath</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: One moment a young policeman was talking to his
wife; the next, he was severely injured. Incident would test doctors,
family.</DH>
<SE>First in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>Phoenix</DL>
<LD>*</LD>
<LD>   PHOENIX -- He had been a cop only a few months when he was called
to his first major fire. An apartment was engulfed, and a bystander
shouted that someone could be inside. Another officer ran to the back
of the building while Jason Schechterle stood at the front alone,
facing the flames, feeling the heat.</LD>
<LD>   The fire devoured everything in its path. He couldn't see walls,
couldn't see ceiling, couldn't see furniture--only the inferno.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Jason peered through a window. Two bodies lay on a
charred bed, skeletons without hair, skin, features. Nothing that
resembled a human being.</TE>
<TE>   "God," he thought, "what a way to die."</TE>
<TE>   Fire had always been among his greatest fears.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cruising the nighttime streets of Phoenix, the 28-year-old
policeman punched the numbers into his cell phone, calling home.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen you in God only knows how long," Jason Schechterle
cooed to his wife, Suzie.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a lot of making up to do, buddy," she teased.</TE>
<TE>   It was their nightly call, a ritual since Jason joined the Phoenix
Police Department 14 months earlier. Suzie had opposed his idea to
quit the power company and join the force; she was worried,
naturally. But when Jason offered to give up his dream for her, she
had to support him.</TE>
<TE>   The phone calls helped calm her nerves, and on this night, March
26, 2001, they were even more flirtatious than usual. Jason had
stayed over at his partner's house the day before to help install a
sprinkler system. Now he had just two hours left on duty before
heading home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna get in bed and snuggle right up next to you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hold you to it," Suzie said, laughing, more like a
schoolgirl than a 30-year-old mother of two.</TE>
<TE>   Then the emergency tone sounded across Jason's patrol car radio,
and a call came crackling in.</TE>
<TE>   "Unknown trouble. 2735 East Thomas," the dispatcher intoned.</TE>
<TE>   No response.</TE>
<TE>   The dispatcher repeated the call and gave a rundown: Dried blood
inside an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Again, no response.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't in his immediate area. It would surely mean working
late. But it sounded like a possible dead body, and no one was
responding.</TE>
<TE>   Jason put Suzie on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "513 Henry," he radioed. "I'll start up."</TE>
<TE>   He went back to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby, I need to go. I'm en route."</TE>
<TE>   Jason flipped on his lights.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11:17 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, groceries in hand, Lawrence Tracy hailed a cab to
head home from the market.</TE>
<TE>   "24th Street and Thomas," he said, climbing in.</TE>
<TE>   The cab turned onto Thomas Road, but suddenly jerked and ran up on
a curb.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you OK?" Tracy asked, but the driver said nothing. Instead,
the cab picked up speed, lurching down the street as light poles and
signs whizzed by.</TE>
<TE>   "Slow down!" Tracy pleaded. The driver didn't respond.</TE>
<TE>   The cab flew through several green lights. Then Tracy saw the next
light, at 20th Street and Thomas, change.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow ...</TE>
<TE>   The car in front slowed to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   Red ...</TE>
<TE>   The cab swerved to avoid the vehicle. To its left, a police car
was stopped with its lights on.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy grabbed the seat and braced for impact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Fire Engine No. 5 also had just been dispatched. It wasn't
an emergency, so when a light at a highway exit ramp near 20th and
Thomas turned red, the truck rolled to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11:21 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there was a fireball.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Michael Ore's crew jumped out of the engine and began
unraveling the hose. Then Ore saw the flashing lights.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the scene of a 962 ... !" he shouted into the radio,
giving the code for an accident with injuries. "Give me a first-alarm
medical. Police car involved."</TE>
<TE>   And then: "Trapped victim!"</TE>
<TE>   Flames licked at the broken frame of the patrol car, its back seat
crushed by the impact. Inside, thick black smoke formed like a storm
cloud in the front seat. Ore couldn't see through it, but he knew
someone was inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurry up!" he yelled to his crew. "There's a man burning to death
in there!"</TE>
<TE>   Darren Boyce aimed the hose inside the car, while rookie Henry
Narvaez fought to open the driver's door. "I can't get it open!"
Narvaez shouted as a small explosion ripped through the right side of
the car, sending flames shooting in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   Ore tossed an ax to Narvaez, who broke through the window. Boyce
kept the flames at bay, but the front seat was smoldering beneath the
smoke and steam. The stench of melted plastic filled Ore's nostrils
as he and Narvaez tugged at the officer, fighting to free him.</TE>
<TE>   But he was still strapped into his seat belt, and they couldn't
get to the latch.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a knife!" Ore screamed.</TE>
<TE>   A policeman who'd just arrived sliced through the seat belt, while
a second officer loosened the legs. Together the men pulled the
officer through the window just as an ambulance drove up.</TE>
<TE>   As they shoved him onto the gurney, a piece of skin peeled off the
officer's arm -- revealing a small patch of white on an otherwise
blackened man. Ore, a 26-year veteran, was stricken.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we did this guy a favor," he thought as the
ambulance pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suzie Schechterle never heard the doorbell. She only remembers
being jostled awake and opening her eyes to the sight of her
husband's partner, Bryan Chapman. He'd been let in by her mother, who
was visiting.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie knew the deal Jason and Bryan had made when they joined the
force. If something happened to either of them, the other would
notify his wife. And now here was Bryan, kneeling at her bedside.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie sat up on her knees, cupped her hands to her mouth and let
out a shriek.</TE>
<TE>   "No-o-o!"</TE>
<TE>   "Jason's been in a very bad accident," Bryan was saying. "Another
car hit him. He's in bad shape."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie called her ex-husband to watch over their 7-year-old
daughter, Kiley, and 2-year-old Zane, her son with Jason.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at Maricopa Medical Center, she had no idea what she was
in for. As Bryan led her through the emergency room and into the
bowels of the hospital, she didn't see the placard reading "Arizona
Burn Center."</TE>
<TE>   The waiting area was a sea of police uniforms, and it parted as
Suzie passed through. She noticed the police chaplain. Was her
husband dead?</TE>
<TE>   Bryan led her through some double doors to a sink, where someone
washed her hands. She wasn't sure why. She heard a mention of fire,
and thought that perhaps Jason had been singed. The corridor smelled
of rotten eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Ushered into a conference room, she saw Jason's parents, brother
and sister.</TE>
<TE>   Then a burly man in aqua operating scrubs walked in, Dr. Daniel
Caruso. The brusque, plainspoken chief of the Arizona Burn Center
held nothing back.</TE>
<TE>   "Your husband sustained third-degree, if not worse, burns to his
head," he told Suzie, explaining that much of Jason's face had been
lost to the fire. The ears. The nose. The hands were bad too.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remove the burns," he finished, "or he'll have no
chance of survival."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso pushed some forms in front of Suzie and told her to sign.
There was no time to waste.</TE>
<TE>   He asked if she wanted to see her husband, but Suzie knew she
couldn't. Not like this. Just hours earlier, she had said it all. He
knew how much she loved him.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," she begged, grabbing Caruso before he left. "Whatever
you have to do, just save him."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do my best," the doctor replied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The team had assembled: Caruso and Dr. Kevin Foster, co-directors
of the burn unit, and Dr. Clifford Smith, the chief resident.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and Smith had been at home, getting ready for bed, when
their pagers went off. Once they got to the hospital, they called in
Foster for another pair of hands. None of them had ever seen anything
like this.</TE>
<TE>   The burns had consumed the skin, tissue and fat in Jason's head,
face and neck. His forehead was scorched right through to the skull.
His hands were seared down to the tendons.</TE>
<TE>   When Caruso first got to the hospital, he ran his gloved hands
over Jason's head. It was hard as oak--a sign of fourth-degree burns,
as severe as they get. Third-degree burns sear through every skin
layer; fourth-degree burns go further, eating through other tissue
and fat.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso was surprised this patient was alive. If a person's whole
head is burned, the airway usually gets clogged with smoke. It swells
shut, and he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   But, at least in terms of timing, everything had worked in Jason's
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters happened to be on the scene when the accident
occurred. An ambulance arrived just as they cut him out, and an
airway was quickly established. And he was young, only 28, and in
good shape.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's mind raced. As serious as the injuries were, the
treatment was the same as for any severe burn: Remove the dead skin
and graft over it with new skin. Usually, he would wait a few days
before beginning the excision to see how the burns progressed, but
these were already too serious.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor knew if he didn't operate immediately, infection would
set in and Jason could die.</TE>
<TE>   In a stark white chamber, a priest performed last rites as Jason
lay on a table under a spotlight. A feeding tube snaked into his
stomach, while a tracheotomy tube extended from his neck to help him
breathe.</TE>
<TE>   The room was stifling. Temperatures climbing above 90 degrees were
necessary to compensate for any drop in Jason's body temperature due
to the loss of skin.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso took his place at the end of the table, ready to begin on
the top of Jason's head. Foster and Smith lined up alongside the
face. Using handheld knife blades akin to cheese graters, the doctors
went to work, peeling back layer upon layer of scorched skin.</TE>
<TE>   They were looking for any sign of life beneath the burns. Dead
tissue resembles worn leather. Healthy tissue looks like medium-rare
steak.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy tissue bleeds.</TE>
<TE>   With each swipe, the realization set in of just how badly this
patient was injured. With each swipe, there was no blood.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso traded the blade for an electronic, pen-sized instrument
that cuts even deeper. He sliced through a swath of skin, and pulled
it from Jason's head.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no blood.</TE>
<TE>   Slice, pull. No blood.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Just what the hell are we doing here?" he demanded, unable to
mask his own disgust. "We're about to take off this guy's entire
face."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the doctor knew if there was a way to save him, this was
it. He worked on, though his misgivings would not go away.</TE>
<TE>   We're removing this guy's complete identity, he thought. We're
going to subject him to surviving this.</TE>
<TE>   Each doctor was thinking the same thing: If it were him on the
table, he'd rather die.</TE>
<TE>   None of them had ever excised burns this deep from a man's head
and face. They had no idea what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   But they had no choice, either: A doctor's duty is to do
everything possible. ...</TE>
<TE>   Slice, pull. No blood.</TE>
<TE>   Like Caruso, Foster and Smith switched instruments and kept
working.</TE>
<TE>   In the hot operating room, hours passed as more skin came off, and
the surgeons' few words grew more and more grim.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not bleeding," one groaned.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing," said another.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, I'm down to muscle."</TE>
<TE>   And then: "I'm down to bone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma, Arkansas Feud Over River Water Standards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAYTON BELLAMY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST SILOAM SPRINGS, Okla.</DL>
<LD>The Illinois River is drab green when it rushes into Oklahoma just
south of here, but it's not Arkansas mud that dirties the water.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma blames phosphorus from Arkansas sewage, animal waste and
fertilizer. The phosphorus promotes the growth of algae that produce
the green tint, which generally worsens as the weather warms and the
river slows.</LD>
<LD>   The color, the foul odor and the danger to aquatic life have led
Oklahoma to propose tighter water quality standards for the Illinois
and the state's five other scenic rivers--standards Arkansas would be
forced to follow.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal has triggered back-and-forth threats between the
neighboring governors--like-minded Republicans who are otherwise
friends--in the states' second major fight over the Illinois River.</TE>
<TE>   The Oklahoma Water Resources Board has approved a limit of 0.037
parts per million of phosphorus in the rivers, to be achieved in 10
years. Phosphorus levels now are nearly seven times that in places.</TE>
<TE>   The standards will take effect unless the Oklahoma Legislature or
Gov. Frank Keating strikes them down.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas must adhere to the standards under a 1992 U.S. Supreme
Court decision that said upstream states are subject to downriver
water quality regulations. That ruling stemmed from an earlier fight
between the two states.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has said the proposed standards are
impossible to achieve and will harm development. "You'd have to
bulldoze every house, business and highway in northwest Arkansas and
relocate everyone out of the area to meet those standards," he said
in April.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Huckabee twice told Oklahoma to back off on the
phosphorus standards or he would place tougher limits on chloride in
the Arkansas River, which flows east through Oklahoma into Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Keating responded by calling for negotiations, but he also
threatened to sue Arkansas if it refused to follow his state's
standards. Arkansas has since backed down, saying it has no plans to
change its chloride standards.</TE>
<TE>   Keating and Huckabee, who have gone duck hunting and eat dinner
together at governors' association meetings, tempered their tough
talk by stressing their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both doing what they think is in the best interest of
their states," Keating spokesman Dan Mahoney said. "Keating has no
ill feeling toward Gov. Huckabee."</TE>
<TE>   The two states first fought over pollution in the Illinois in 1982
when the city of Fayetteville, Ark., wanted to build a new wastewater
treatment plant on the river. Arkansas won in the Supreme Court, but
the court also ruled that upstream states are subject to downriver
states' water quality regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Fite, administrator of Oklahoma Scenic Rivers, said the
Illinois is still fairly healthy. But it is changing from a river
rich in animals to one that is filling with plants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The algae growth turns the water green, creates a foul smell and
taste and threatens fish by reducing the river's oxygen level, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fite said scientists have determined that populous northwestern
Arkansas, home to hundreds of big poultry farms, contributes more
than four times the phosphorus in the river that Oklahoma does.</TE>
<TE>   Morril Herriman, executive vice president of the Poultry
Federation, an industry group, said the proposed limit is
unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   To comply with the new standards, Arkansas would have to upgrade
waste treatment plants, restrict chicken waste and fertilizer
applications or use extensive buffer strips along the river.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas already uses some of those methods, but it is not known
whether expanding them will be enough, said Earl Smith, chief of the
water management division of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation
Commission.</TE>

<HD>Man Accused of Posing as Official at Bridge Collapse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAYTON BELLAMY</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>TULSA, Okla. -- The man wearing a green beret and camouflage fatigues
called himself Capt. William Clark from the Army's Special Forces. He
arrived two hours after an interstate bridge collapsed and said he
was in charge.</LD>
<LD>   Some emergency workers listened to him for a few days until he
disappeared from the site. Authorities said Friday that the man is an
ex-convict from Missouri who impersonated an officer to get free
food, lodging and a pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a big ego trip," said Lt. Brent Grill, lead police
investigator in Van Buren, Ark., where the man is accused of renting
rooms and not paying. "It's a fantasy of his, which becomes a reality
when he gets to play the part."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities identified the man as Billy Clark, 36, of Tallapoosa,
Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Clark allegedly arrived in Webbers Falls just two hours after the
May 26 bridge collapse and told Mayor Jewell Horne that he was in
charge. He took charge at the launch site that sent rescue boats to
where the section of the bridge collapsed into the Arkansas River,
killing 14 people.</TE>
<TE>   He already knew about one victim--Army Capt. Andrew
Clements--before any bodies had been pulled from the river and asked
to look through the victim's briefcase and laptop computer, the mayor
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept trying to say that he was in charge," Horne said. "I
finally looked at him and said, 'No, you're not. Until the governor
declares martial law, you are not in charge in this town.' "</TE>
<TE>   Crawford County, Ark., authorities issued an arrest warrant for
Clark Thursday on one charge of felony theft of services, alleging he
did not pay the $900 bill for eight rooms he had rented at a motel
May 28.</TE>
<TE>   Clark told the motel clerk the rooms were for other rescuers and
Clements' father and put "Do Not Disturb" signs on seven of the
rooms, which were never occupied, Grill said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark allegedly told Van Buren police he was a Special Forces
captain from Fort Carson, Colo., on leave from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Searcy, Ark., about 230 miles from Webbers Falls, said a
man who identified himself as a Special Forces captain went to a
dealership and said he needed a truck to transport supplies to the
bridge site. Clark left with a red pickup worth $10,600, employee
Mike Milligan said. The man's manner was very convincing, Milligan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew what he was doing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was released from the Central Missouri Correctional Center
on Dec. 11 after serving three years for stealing, said Tim Kniest,
spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Clark also
served two years of probation in 1999 for passing bad checks, Kniest
said.</TE>
<TE>   It's just the latest in a string of alleged impostors who have
bluffed their way into restricted areas after national disasters.</TE>
<TE>   A man who posed as a volunteer firefighter to gain access to the
collapsed World Trade Center was sentenced in March to one to three
years in prison. Another man was sentenced to six months in jail in
1996 for impersonating a doctor at the TWA Flight 800 crash site.</TE>

<HD>Poetry's Keepers Share Passion</HD>
<DH>Culture: Local laureates usually have day jobs and make
little money. But they're dedicated to reaching their communities
through their craft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE LUCEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEWTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Written on the wall of a parking garage. Discussed in a prison
reading group. Read aloud at a Habitat for Humanity groundbreaking.</LD>
<LD>   With words, rhyme, meter and a little unconventional thinking,
laureates are trying to make poetry a part of life in every corner of
the country, from Newtown, Pa., to Portsmouth, N.H., to Naples, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   "In the United States we've come to look at poetry as extraneous,
not at all practical," said Allen Hoey, poet laureate of Bucks
County, Pa. "There's a very long history of poets being central to
civic life."</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the poet laureate of the United States--America's official
poet who receives national attention and presides over readings in
Washington--city and county poet laureates aren't usually well known.
Most publish on a small scale, have day jobs and receive little, if
any, money.</TE>
<TE>   Past U.S. poet laureates have included Robert Penn Warren, Rita
Dove and Robert Frost. The latest is Billy Collins, who received a
six-figure advance to sign with Random House. Ten thousand copies of
his book of poetry, "Sailing Alone Around the World," were sold last
June, the month he was named poet laureate by the Library of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But regardless of fame and success, the role of educating people
about poetics is the same.</TE>
<TE>   Hoey says reading and writing poetry have always been his
passions. A professor at Bucks County Community College in Newtown,
his basement office is crammed with floor to ceiling bookshelves
filled with worn volumes of William Blake, Ezra Pound and Ted Hughes,
England's former poet laureate.</TE>
<TE>   His term lasts a year and he is the 25th poet laureate in Bucks
County, which has one of the older programs around.</TE>
<TE>   Hoey, whose shaggy hair and wire-rimmed glasses are offset by
denim jeans and sneakers, says he would like poets to be more
recognized in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a shame and an impoverishment that we don't see
poets as being vital," he says. "We're here. Try to use us more."</TE>
<TE>   Hoey treasures the moments when his position is appreciated. One
of the "coolest" experiences of his laureate tenure happened recently
when a woman approached him in the street.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'You're the poet, aren't you? This is going to be a
good day--I saw the poet,' " Hoey recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Rules surrounding laureates vary from town to town. The terms
range from one to four years and duties can include writing poems for
official occasions or developing a poetry event.</TE>
<TE>   In Northampton, Mass., Portsmouth, N.H., and Bucks County they
receive a small grant--less than $1,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the local laureates, Martin Espada, 45, is easily the best
known. The University of Massachusetts professor has published six
books of poetry and has won many awards and fellowships, including an
American Book Award. He is the first poet laureate of Northampton and
has served half of his two-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Espada says he has tried to introduce poetry to high schools and
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   "In high schools what are we focused on? Taking tests. Those kids
tend to fade away and end up in the parking lot, which is where I
spent most of my high school," says Espada, who grew up in Brooklyn,
N.Y. "I think you'll find a great potential for poetry right there."</TE>
<TE>   Naples also has a first-time poet laureate. The artistic community
appointed former minister and local writer Sheldon Flory, 74, to the
post earlier this year. Flory has already written a poem about the
town park.</TE>
<TE>   The poet laureate in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's conservative
capital, also works in schools. Iya Isoke was appointed in January by
the mayor, who since 1982 has chosen a laureate for each of his
four-year terms. As a "spoken-word poet," she tries to show kids the
similarities between rap and poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "I show the kids how to articulate their thoughts," she says. "You
can get out anger, pain, happiness--you can get all of that out
through words."</TE>
<TE>   Isoke, 34, hopes to open a spoken-word poetry club.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching people through poems is what makes the job exhilarating,
the laureates say.</TE>
<TE>   Maren Tirabassi, 51, Portsmouth's third poet laureate since the
town's program began five years ago, says she already sees changes
there.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more people think of poetry as not being exclusively
academic or intellectual but available to them," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Tirabassi says her project is to put together an anthology of
poems about Portsmouth. The laureate before her tried to add poetry
to the town's physical landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things my immediate predecessor did is poetry in
public places--poetry in the parking garage and the wharf, buildings,
coffee shops," she says. "That was his piece of getting poetry out to
people who never pick up a book. But they're parking their car and
see a Robert Frost poem and they go, 'Oh!' "</TE>

<HD>Higher Mathematics Doesn't Add Up, He Says</HD>
<DH>Universe: Physicist Stephen Wolfram argues that simple
rules, not profound equations, can explain life's mysteries. But
skeptics doubt that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT CRENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>To the countless would-be scientists whose careers foundered on the
baffling shoals of calculus, a brilliant physicist who earned his
Ph.D. at 20 and snagged a MacArthur "genius" grant at 22 seems an
unlikely source of comfort.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Stephen Wolfram has some inspiring words for the
mathematically challenged. In his self-published and unexpectedly
popular book, Wolfram argues that sophisticated mathematics has led
science astray in its effort to explain the natural world.</LD>
<LD>   "A New Kind of Science" proposes that simple rules, not complex
equations, are the key to such profound scientific mysteries as the
structure of the universe and the incredible diversity of life on
Earth.</LD>
<TE>   "With the new kind of science I have developed, it suddenly
becomes possible to make progress on a remarkable range of
fundamental issues that have never successfully been addressed by any
of the existing sciences before," Wolfram boldly asserts on Page 1 of
the 1,200-page tome that took him 15 years to write.</TE>
<TE>   So many people are interested in Wolfram's ideas that the book had
already sold out of its first printing of 50,000 copies by its May 14
publication date. Even at $44.95 a copy, the title was one of the top
10 books on Amazon.com's best-seller list two weeks after it came
out.</TE>
<TE>   Most scientists haven't read the book yet, but the few who have
remain skeptical. "It's a useful perspective, but I think he
overstates the case," said Ray Kurzweil, a computer scientist and
inventor who specializes in artificial intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Wolfram's reputation is such that "A New Kind of Science" is
selling like tickets to the Stones. After stints at the California
Institute of Technology and the Institute for Advanced Studies,
Wolfram invented Mathematica, an all-purpose technical computing
package, to do the kind of analyses described in his book. Then he
started selling it to software developers, engineers, financial
analysts and scientists of all stripes.</TE>
<TE>   "Mathematica is a very general-purpose system," said Dana Scott, a
professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. "You can
use it very, very well for a lot of experimental investigations."</TE>
<TE>   After Mathematica made him a multimillionaire, Wolfram semiretired
to an upstairs office in his Chicago home to work full-time on his
book. That was a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 years, Wolfram worked all night and slept during the day.
Occasionally he shared drafts of his book with colleagues and friends
but much of the time he lived as a recluse, shunning scientific
meetings and other gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   "The book, I hope, is fairly readable to kind of general people,"
Wolfram said in a telephone interview from his current home in the
Boston area. "It's something where I'm getting to the frontiers of
science in a way that it's accessible."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent hourlong interview, he offered opinions about
physics, evolution, the nature of mathematics, the uniqueness of
human intelligence and the best way to spot signals from beings on
other planets. He built virtually every sentence into a dizzying
edifice of abstractions, then abruptly left it unfinished so he could
start another one.</TE>
<TE>   "A New Kind of Science" is rooted in Wolfram's discovery during
the 1980s that very simple computer programs known as cellular
automata can produce strikingly complex results.</TE>
<TE>   In their most basic form, these programs take a pattern of gridded
black and white squares and add to or modify them according to a
simple set of rules. Such programs usually generate beautiful
checkered, striped and nested patterns that can exhibit incredible
intricacy.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not what Wolfram considers most important. His
obsession is the occasional cellular automaton that reels off a
random pattern of black and white squares ad infinitum.</TE>
<TE>   You can make one of these curiosities by filling in some of the
squares in the top row of a sheet of graph paper. Then move to the
next row of squares. Blacken a square unless the one directly above
it and both of its neighbors are the same color, or the one above has
a black neighbor on the left and a white neighbor on the right. Then
go to row three and repeat the process. Then row four, row five and
so on.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram has programmed computers to do this simple exercise and
similar ones millions and millions of times over. What they have
produced has amazed him.</TE>
<TE>   "What I found--to my great surprise--was that ... even some of the
very simplest programs that I looked at had behavior that was as
complex as anything I had ever seen," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   No amount of careful observation, no mathematical equation could
ever predict what the next row of squares produced by one of these
simple programs will look like. The only way to find out is to follow
the rule.</TE>
<TE>   At this point one might ask, "So what?"</TE>
<TE>   Why would a software millionaire with impeccable scientific
credentials spend years poring over such apparent trivialities?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Wolfram explains, when traditional science encounters
something with no mathematically reducible pattern it simply throws
up its hands. But his experiments show that apparently random
processes can arise from surprisingly simple rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our intuition that when we see something in nature that
looks complicated, then somehow the explanation must be complicated,"
Wolfram said. "The surprising thing that I've found is that in the
world of simple programs this is not the case."</TE>
<TE>   His book argues that nature doesn't require complicated
explanations either. If he's right, scientists should be able to
expose some fairly simple machinery buried deep inside some of
nature's most seemingly complex creations.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm trying to do here is answer some of the questions that
traditional science hasn't had much success in answering," Wolfram
said.</TE>
<TE>   After taking about 360 pages of "A New Kind of Science" to explain
some basic theory, he embarks on a grand tour of intractable
scientific mysteries.</TE>
<TE>   He starts with some relatively simple ones, such as a theory to
explain the intricate and amazingly diverse crystal patterns of
snowflakes. From there he moves on to question the importance of
natural selection in evolution and the universality of the second law
of thermodynamics, which states that natural processes, though
theoretically reversible, proceed only in the direction of increased
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts are likely to receive especially cool receptions in
the halls of academe, where attacking such fundamental and robust
principles is considered the pinnacle of quackery.</TE>
<TE>   "One could run these automata for trillions or even trillions of
trillions of iterations," Kurzweil protested in a review of the book.
"They do not evolve into, say, insects, or humans, or Chopin
preludes, or anything else that we might consider a higher level of
complexity."</TE>
<TE>   Physicists may find Wolfram's take on their field more palatable.
His notion that the universe, on the tiniest of submicroscopic
scales, is composed of a network whose connections are repeatedly
updated accounts for several oddities, including the curvature of
space-time demonstrated by Einstein.</TE>
<TE>   It will be years before anybody, including Wolfram himself, knows
whether the ideas presented in "A New Kind of Science" really are the
biggest thing since an apocryphal apple struck Sir Isaac Newton's
head. Wolfram's colleagues will have to set up their own computer
experiments, measure and observe the real world, debate the
significance of what they see and push their fields forward in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   But first they'll have to read the book.</TE>

<DL>SOUND BEACH, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Prison took a lot from Lenny Callace, but he walked out from behind
bars holding tight to his innocence and his life. For a while, at
least.</LD>
<LD>   He lost nearly six years to prison for a crime he didn't commit.
He missed the chance to say goodbye to his dying mother--"my heart"
he called her. He couldn't trust anyone anymore, his father said. The
mother of his children left him.</LD>
<LD>   Callace himself, trying to describe it, said: "I'm not right. I
snap. Last night, I had to go for a walk--2 o'clock for a walk!"</LD>
<TE>   Facing a sexual assault charge, Callace spurned a plea bargain
that would have freed him. No, he insisted, he was innocent. DNA
finally proved him right.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a free man!" Callace shouted when a judge vacated his 25- to
50-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But there were things he was not free of.</TE>
<TE>   Before prison, Callace was his neighborhood's "happy-go-lucky
guy," said Val Gallo, a friend from his days in "The Hole," an
Italian American enclave in East New York.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two when he was arrested, he was a lean guy with a blond
goatee, chiseled features and a cross tattoo on his hand from his
rough days on the streets. A sometime thief, he worked construction
and drove a cab. He had four kids, an estranged wife and a girlfriend
who left him while he was in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Free at 38, he was ecstatic at first, taking a bunch of friends to
Atlantic City in a limousine, talking about buying a house. But
slowly, his friends and family could see the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Things kept coming back," says his younger brother, Pierre. "He
went back on drugs, he was drinking, he could never live with it.
Words never really could describe the pain he was in."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, two months after he was set free, Callace tried to
explain, telling an Associated Press reporter: "I'm just glad it's
over with, but I've got a lot of hate, frustration."</TE>
<TE>   He got steadily worse, said Gallo, who lived with Callace in the
years after prison. He drank more and more-- "24-7," a pint bottle of
vodka always in his pocket. Heroin, a part of his life before and
during prison, led to cycles of rehab and relapse.</TE>
<TE>   He got $500,000 from the state for his wrongful conviction, but
what wasn't spent on lawyers went to drugs and booze. He was treated
for substance abuse and depression.</TE>
<TE>   Callace would keep watching the videotape of his half-dozen TV
appearances--he was on "Nightline," a Geraldo Rivera broadcast, talk
shows--feeling like a rock star, his brother and friends recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Telling his story, he always was angry that the real criminal
never was charged--and that the five-year statute of limitations
meant he never would be.</TE>
<TE>   "The system isn't perfect," acknowledges James Catterson, the
former district attorney, adding he was glad Callace was freed.</TE>
<TE>   When Lenny Callace died, four years after he won his freedom back,
it was by his own hand, with a needle and a high.</TE>
<TE>   He overdosed on heroin, his body was found in a parked car a few
miles from the neighborhood where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day, he had received a check for part of a government
settlement for the years he spent as an innocent man behind bars.</TE>

<HD>Pollutants Often Invade Even Pristine Peaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BRIDGES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atop Hawaii's Mauna Loa, thrust 13,680 feet into the sky, one would
expect nothing but the freshest of air, save the occasional gaseous
burp from the volcano.</LD>
<LD>   But environmental monitoring stations crowding the peak record
arsenic, copper and zinc kicked into the atmosphere five to 10 days
earlier from smelting in China, thousands of miles away.</LD>
<LD>   When industrial pollution first showed up at Mauna Loa a few years
ago, scientists were startled. Now, after intense study, they know
that the pollution that dirties the world's largest cities affects
the whole Earth.</LD>
<TE>   "It turns out Hawaii is more like a suburb of Beijing," said
Thomas Cahill, a UC Davis atmospheric scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Along the West Coast, a campaign to measure the pollutants as they
make landfall after bridging the Pacific ends this month.</TE>
<TE>   Since April, scientists have used data gathered on the ground and
from an airplane flying along the coast to measure aerosol pollutants
that waft eastward each spring, carried by the prevailing winds.</TE>
<TE>   For the United States, China is a major source. For Europe, it's
the United States, and likewise down the line, complicating the blame
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a natural human condition to point to someone else
who is causing your problems," said David Parrish, a research chemist
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "Each state
points to the state upwind and says, 'You're causing our problems.' "</TE>
<TE>   The effects can be dramatic. In May 1998, Cahill and others
measured the highest atmospheric concentrations of arsenic ever seen
in the western United States in tiny Jarbidge, Nev., population 12.
The probable source: China.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing that is going to get anyone sick. It's just that it
shouldn't have been there," Cahill said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists previously supposed that only greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide were so global in reach and effect. They now
understand that the microscopic, suspended particles of
pollutants--generically called aerosols by scientists--also wrap the
globe, even if they persist for just hours before settling to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   This class of pollutants includes soot, salts, dust and the
byproducts of the burning of fossil fuels and vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens on a small scale, but the implications are on a global
scale," said V. Ramanathan, an atmospheric scientist at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography.</TE>
<TE>   During their time aloft, the particles affect everything from
global warming to human mortality to the rainfall that ultimately
scrubs them from the atmosphere. Scientists long thought aerosols
were day-trippers, since they were assumed to settle from the
atmosphere close to their point of origin. In fact, many are. The
cloud of smoke, dust and other pollutants from the attack on the
World Trade Center didn't travel far, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   But beginning in the 1950s, scientists began noticing layers of
haze in places such as the Arctic, far from any significant source of
pollution. The haze suggested that aerosols were capable of traveling
jet-setter distances.</TE>
<TE>   Now, armed with satellites, airplanes, balloons, ship- and
land-based observatories, scientists track with accuracy the
pollutants and the winds that carry them.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's anything we've learned over the years, it's there is a
lot of long-range transport up there that no one was ever aware of,"
said Ken Rahn, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Large storms can hoist a plume of particles high enough to hook up
with the jet stream. Once high enough, dust from the Sahara or smoke
from big fires "can easily travel halfway across the globe," said
Yoram Kaufman, a senior scientist with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.</TE>
<TE>   When plugged into higher-altitude winds, the sometimes vibrant
plumes can be charted.</TE>
<TE>   The best examples are the billowing clouds of dust kicked up each
spring in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. That dust blows east, passing over
cities such as Beijing. There, the particles are frosted by various
pollutants, many of them toxic. The noxious confection continues to
blow eastward, arriving in the United States within days.</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't just China. Aerosols have been tracked from the
Sahara to the Caribbean, from Ontario to Rhode Island, from Germany
to Sweden. Within them travel toxic metals, nutrients, viruses and
fungi.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a small world. We breathe each other's air," Cahill
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the problem new: Pollutants generated by the smelting of
ores by the Greeks and Romans show up today, 2,000 or more years
later, in trace amounts in ice cores drilled from Greenland.</TE>
<TE>   "These dust plumes don't go away right away. They can be carried
over great distances and are forcing people to take a global
perspective on pollution," said Barry Huebert, a professor of
oceanography at the University of Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of aerosols are obvious in cities such as Beijing,
where the springtime mantle of dust and pollution cuts visibility to
feet.</TE>
<TE>   There, Cahill jokes, you can tell it's a sunny day if the sky is
bright brown. If it's rainy, it's still brown, just a darker shade.</TE>
<TE>   "You're living in a sepia world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny particles make for spectacular sunsets, but they also
pose a serious health hazard, as they can lodge deep in the lungs,
contributing to shortened life spans.</TE>
<TE>   Aerosols also might harm agriculture by blocking portions of the
spectrum of light from the sun, starving crops such as wheat and rice
of the energy they need to grow.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest worry, and the one least understood, is the effect
aerosols have on weather and climate.</TE>
<TE>   Some aerosols can cool the planet by shading it from the sun.
Others can warm it by absorbing and trapping the sun's heat.</TE>
<TE>   "[Aerosols] are clearly right at the center of some important
climatic issues," Huebert said.</TE>
<TE>   Aerosols also might have the ability to aid in the formation of
clouds, while retarding their rainfall, scientists reported in
December in a study in the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>   Drops of water will coalesce around aerosols in clouds but not
clump together to form the larger drops that gravity pulls from the
sky as rain.</TE>
<TE>   "We humans may be pushing precipitation away from populated
regions," said NASA's Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   The dust is not all bad news, though; the wafting plumes also
carry nutrients to regions that depend on them. On Hawaii, plant life
relies on Asian phosphorus and calcium to grow. Phytoplankton--those
bottom feeders of the food chain--in the waters off the Alaskan coast
crave Asian iron, which blows eastward literally by the millions of
tons.</TE>
<TE>   Still, scientists believe it's important to trace the origin of
the pollutants, and they say they can do that by using the unique
chemistry of aerosols as a fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   Rahn, the oceanography professor, has developed a roster of about
150 compounds, each with its own signature. With some work,
scientists can distinguish between soot from a power plant burning
low-sulfur coal from Paonia, Colo., and from a forest fire raging in
the Brazilian rain forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the scientists say these particles are coming from here,
here and here, at that point it's finger-pointing," says Ramanathan,
who has proposed a national effort to study aerosols. "That's
something we have to leave to the politicians to figure out."</TE>

<HD>Once-Proud Suburbs Fail to Age Gracefully</HD>
<DH>Towns: While outer areas grow, older communities see their
populations and tax bases dwindle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN POET</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLLINGDALE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The neatly aligned rows of attached homes were once inhabited by the
families of workers who toiled in nearby factories.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-five-year-old Tony DeVito was one of them, working at a
now-closed Westinghouse factory in nearby Lester, where hundreds of
employees made turbines. And, though plenty of people still pass the
handful of Collingdale's downtown shops on their way to the trolley
to Philadelphia, the borough's population is falling. The 2000 census
put it at 8,664 residents, down 18% from its 1970 peak of 10,605.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what it's going to be like in, say, another 10
years. I don't think this neighborhood will be any better than some
places in Philadelphia. It's heading downhill," said DeVito, standing
on the front porch of his early 1900s brick row house. "Taxes are
pretty high.... I would like to move out farther, near my brothers
and sisters."</LD>
<TE>   Across the country, old, often small suburbs such as Collingdale
that were among the first to welcome the cities' middle class are
seeing their populations dwindle or stagnate while outer suburbs
grow. The people who remain tend to be older, poorer and in greater
need of social services--from elderly care to unemployment
assistance. And that, experts say, could threaten the long-term
economic and social health of the region.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the national shift more apparent than in Delaware
County in suburban Philadelphia. The grid-like streets of its older,
inner-ring suburbs just outside the city limits are filled with older
homes. The western towns, on the other hand, are dotted with farms,
bright strip malls and brand-new developments where three-bedroom,
two-bath houses start around $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly bisected by Interstate 476, Delaware County's boroughs and
townships between the highway and Philadelphia saw a population
decline of about 2.2% between 1990 and 2000. To the west of the
highway, farther out, the number of residents grew by almost 5%.</TE>
<TE>   The trend can be seen in older cities across the country, in
suburbs outside Detroit, Pittsburgh, even Boston.</TE>
<TE>   And for every shrinking suburb such as Collingdale or Northwoods,
Mo., near St. Louis, there is a Collegeville, Pa., or Wildwood, Mo.,
outer suburbs where the population ballooned about 90% during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The explanations are numerous.</TE>
<TE>   Among the clearest is the availability of cheap land. Americans'
love for their cars and tolerance of long commutes has only bolstered
the shift.</TE>
<TE>   That's what is happening in Collegeville, about 25 miles northwest
of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Miller, a real estate agent for 19 years, said pharmaceutical
companies have drawn thousands of workers to the area. Other
residents simply prefer a place where new luxury homes sit next to
wide-open farms.</TE>
<TE>   "People tolerate the commute because they want to be in a more
rural area. We have all the conveniences here, all the shopping they
need, good schools," Miller said. "They're willing to commute to get
more house for their money."</TE>
<TE>   Those left behind by the migration create greater demand for
social services.</TE>
<TE>   "You had poorer communities being asked to provide more services
for people who increasingly couldn't pay for the services," said Bill
Fontana, executive director of the Pennsylvania Downtown Center, a
nonprofit group that encourages downtown development. "It's a real
nasty downward spiral."</TE>
<TE>   It's much the same as the downward spiral that has threatened big
cities for decades.</TE>
<TE>   But the suburb's size works against it.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these communities are small in terms of population and
tax base," so falling tax revenues can more easily hurt city budgets,
said Barry Seymour of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning
Commission in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   That's a problem facing Bucks County. Home to one of the original
car-centric suburbs, Levittown, its older bedroom communities are
competing with new housing developments 25 miles from downtown
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing was strong when the old suburbs were built in the
1950s and '60s. But manufacturers, from steel plants and their
ancillary businesses to textile mills, moved away, taking jobs with
them.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Fairless Works, a sprawling U.S. Steel plant along
the Delaware River, once employed more than 8,000 workers who each
year made more than a million tons of cold rolled steel and tin mill
products. Today, all that's left on the site, where overgrown grass
is overtaking corrugated metal buildings, is a remnant of the
business and a few hundred workers.</TE>
<TE>   But the county is trying to turn things around by helping the
communities find ways to reuse industrial sites, subsidize public
transit and use tax breaks to encourage development along the river,
said Lynn Bush, executive director of the county planning commission.</TE>
<TE>   Officials want to improve public access to the river -- the county
has about 75 miles of Delaware Riverfront -- by converting old
industrial sites to housing, office buildings or parks. Known for its
quaint antique shops and farmland, Bucks County also has an
aggressive program to save open space, funded by a $59-million bond
issue approved by voters in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to focus on what's really important to us, what
makes Bucks County special," Bush said. "We need to recognize that
it's a waste of resources to abandon the useful."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, experts say turning around the population declines and
improving the economic health of older suburbs depends on taking
advantage of their strengths, such as the quality of older houses.</TE>
<TE>   "The older suburbs have better locations, transportation, rail
services that new suburbs might not have," Seymour said.</TE>
<TE>   The same notions apply to commercial activities, such as shopping.
Unique shops and personalized service go a long way toward keeping
alive small, downtown shopping districts.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Hubing, owner of The Country Hub gift shop in downtown
Ambler, has been in business 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different feeling, a more personal feeling. That's what we
strive for," Hubing said. "The people who come in don't like malls.
We keep hearing from our customers, 'I love shopping in small towns.'

<HD>Scientists Will Try to Relocate Orca</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: A team plans to recapture killer whale found near
Seattle for a return to pod in Canada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY ANDERSEN</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>SEATTLE -- Five months after a young female killer whale was spotted
near the Vashon Island ferry dock, the federal government says it
will try to capture her this week for eventual relocation to her
native waters in Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The young orca will be captured and immobilized--in a net or by
securing her tail--and then placed on a barge for a quick trip to a
net pen at Manchester on the Kitsap Peninsula, said spokesman Brian
Gorman with the National Marine Fisheries Service.</LD>
<LD>   The government is hiring a private contractor to head the capture
team, probably a local man with experience in the multimillion-dollar
effort to reunite Keiko with his birth pod off Greenland, Gorman
said. That four-year effort has so far been unsuccessful. Keiko, star
of the movie "Free Willy," had previously lived in captivity for 21
years.</LD>
<TE>   The young female--dubbed A-73 for her birth order in her family
group, called A-pod--is to stay in the pen 10 to 14 days for
treatment of a skin ailment, worms and other apparently minor health
problems, Gorman said. She'll also undergo a series of tests and
effectively be in quarantine to ensure she doesn't take any serious
health problems back to her pod.</TE>
<TE>   She will be fed fish in the pen, some of them dead to allow
medication of the 12-foot orphan. "The other advantage of dead fish
is that you know what she's eating," Gorman said. "But the idea is to
transfer her as quickly as possible to live salmon."</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the move to Canada are still being developed, he said.
Once there, she will be kept in an inlet that has been netted off "so
she can swim freely and maintain muscle tone and wait for her pod to
appear."</TE>
<TE>   Her family group spends summers off Vancouver Island. In Canada,
she'll be tended by federal officials from Fisheries and Oceans
Canada and veterinary personnel from the Vancouver Aquarium.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been mulling intervention since A-73 was
spotted in mid-January. They weighed the risks of capture against her
long-term prospects in busy Puget Sound. For years, killer whales
were shot by area fishermen. Then, in the 1960s and '70s, dozens were
captured for display in aquariums around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The A-73 project marks the first known attempt to help one of the
animals in the wild, and it comes as the local killer whale
population is being considered for listing as an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   The population of the state's three resident pods has dropped from
98 in 1995 to 78 due to declining salmon runs, pollution and vessel
noise and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   As Bob Lohn, regional administrator for NMFS, told a media
conference May 24 when he announced the decision to proceed: "We
don't know what the prospects are, but we think it is worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers believe A-73 was orphaned last year. She apparently
wandered into Puget Sound after she was left behind by her family,
which never ventures into these waters. Without the support of her
pod, this intelligent social animal is lonely--and missing valuable
education about cooperation and survival.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that she will rejoin A-pod this summer. It is not
known whether the pod will accept her after months of separation, but
U.S. officials decided her prospects were better in her native waters
than here.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Canadian researchers--and those at the nonprofit Center
for Whale Research in the San Juans--have no prior experience with
orphan orcas managing solo.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there are two juveniles trying to survive alone in the
region--Canada's A-73 down here and a young male, dubbed L-98 for his
birth order in the San Juans' L-pod, who was spotted on the west side
of Vancouver Island in November.</TE>

<KH>CITIZEN McCAIN, By Elizabeth Drew, Simon &amp; Schuster: 182 pp.,
$23</KH>
<HD>Arizona Powerhouse</HD>
<DH>A Snapshot of Washington's Most Centrist Politician</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Ronald Brownstein is the national political
correspondent for the Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona Sen. John McCain may be the most intriguing figure in
Washington today. His challenge to George W. Bush--the overwhelming
choice of the GOP financial and elected establishment--for the
Republican presidential nomination in 2000 was the most effective
insurgent presidential campaign in a generation. McCain touched such
a popular chord, especially with moderate and independent voters,
that he returned to Congress as one of the few legislators ever whose
stature was enhanced by a losing presidential run.</LD>
<LD>   Since Bush took office, McCain has continued the ideological
odyssey that began in his 2000 race. McCain arrived in Washington
during the 1980s as a conventional small-government Republican. But,
with Theodore Roosevelt as his model, he has become increasingly open
to federal action on a broad range of problems. McCain isn't a policy
junkie, and the depth of his knowledge on some domestic issues
sometimes runs only a sound bite deep. But rarely has Washington seen
a politician rethink his fundamental beliefs so completely after he
arrived.</LD>
<TE>   This evolution has opened deep divides between McCain and most of
his Senate Republican colleagues, few of whom have voted for his
major legislative initiatives since the 2000 race. But it has made
him a magnet for Democrats looking to construct centrist coalitions
in the closely divided Senate. McCain has seized the opportunity.
Once a gadfly and maverick, he's now building more alliances across
party lines than any senator in recent memory. McCain is
co-sponsoring so many major bills with Democrats that his has become
the most hyphenated name in Washington: everything from
McCain-Hollings (airport security) to McCain-Kennedy-Edwards (managed
care reform) to McCain-Kerry (improving automotive fuel economy) to,
of course, McCain-Feingold (campaign finance reform). It's a measure
of McCain's continuing power as a symbol of reform that every
congressional Democrat seriously considering a bid for the party's
2004 presidential nomination is now co-sponsoring legislation with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, almost none of this rich story comes through in veteran
Washington journalist Elizabeth Drew's new book on the senator,
"Citizen McCain." Focusing narrowly on McCain's drive, with
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, to pass the campaign
finance reform legislation that Bush finally signed earlier this
year, Drew gets utterly lost in the details. The result is that this
thin book feels both skimpy and padded. It contains more than anyone
might ever want to know about the backstage negotiations on the rule
that governed debate on the campaign finance bill in the House of
Representatives. But it offers no history or broader perspective to
frame its ostensible subjects: McCain and the effort to limit money
in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Drew never fully grapples with the largest questions swirling
around McCain and the campaign finance reform bill. Nor does she ever
seriously question whether the new campaign finance limits (primarily
the ban on previously unregulated soft money contributions) will
change Washington as much as its authors believe, though there's
considerable evidence that ideological polarization is a greater
problem in Congress than special interest influence. Though
accurately recording McCain's sharpened skills as a legislator, the
book doesn't assess whether he's become such a lightning rod for
other Republicans that his name on a bill guarantees increased
resistance from conservatives (including those in the White House).</TE>
<TE>   "Citizen McCain" simply drops the reader into the Senate in
January 2001, explaining virtually nothing about the decade-long
legislative struggle over campaign finance reform that preceded the
final drive. Nor does it adequately consider the impact of McCain's
2000 race, which provided a critical injection of momentum for the
reform effort and undoubtedly influenced Bush's decision to sign the
bill. It doesn't help that Drew renders her story in lifeless prose
that veers toward stenography. The overall effect is like being
trapped on the Senate subway with a conscientious but very dull, and
not particularly insightful, tour guide.</TE>
<TE>   McCain is such an interesting subject, and he provided Drew with
such unusual access, that the book still has its moments. McCain
admirers will enjoy the comrades-in-the-foxhole irreverence of his
interaction with his staff. Students of Washington will be fascinated
by the way he manages his relationships with his Senate colleagues,
such as Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a sometimes ally who
became an adversary in the final struggle over the campaign reform
legislation. But the book's narrow perspective and enervating
presentation ultimately defeat even McCain. He never really comes to
life, even after the book abruptly switches gears three-fourths of
the way through to recount his role in the weeks after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. In other hands, the story of McCain and his staff
scrambling out of their Capitol Hill offices on the chaotic morning
of the hijackings might have been riveting; here the account of their
movements carries all the drama of a travel itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the largest disappointment, Drew offers few insights
about McCain's broader impact on the political landscape. No one can
predict exactly where McCain is going; even the senator, who reacts
better than he plans, probably doesn't know for sure. Some supporters
would like to see him challenge Bush as an independent in 2004. More
recently, two liberal magazines have suggested he run in 2004 as a
Democrat (a prospect that his opposition to abortion alone would seem
to make implausible).</TE>
<TE>   McCain has brushed aside all those ideas and, at 65, recovering
from skin cancer, it seems unlikely he would enlist for the rigors
and long odds of another presidential campaign. But even without
another bid for the White House, McCain is developing a
reform-oriented agenda with potentially enormous appeal to
independent and centrist voters in both parties. Even though most of
his initiatives are likely to be blocked, he could be playing a role
similar to that of the great Senate progressives of the 1920s whose
(mostly failed) legislative crusades helped define the agenda for
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Some future centrist president from
either party (or even an independent party that doesn't today exist)
may owe McCain a debt for the ideas he is developing now. But it will
take another author, with a wider lens, to track the trajectory of
McCain's thinking and explain how his evolution may tilt the balance
of power in a nation now divided almost exactly in half between the
two major parties.</TE>

<DH>THE RECKONING: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein, By
Sandra Mackey, W.W. Norton: 416 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW COCKBURN</AU>
<BD>Andrew Cockburn is the co-author of "Out of the Ashes:
The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consulted on suitable bombing targets by an Air Force general just
before the Persian Gulf War, former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia James
Akins replied that he didn't have many ideas on what to blow up but
could offer some insights on Iraqi politics and Saddam Hussein, whom
he had known for years. The general politely declined the offer,
indicating that such analysis was considered irrelevant among the war
planners. "You see," he explained to the veteran diplomat, "this war
has no political overtones."</LD>
<LD>   Fortified by willful ignorance, the United States and its allies
went to war with one straightforward political objective for Iraq:
Kill its president. The chosen instruments were laser-guided bombs
rained on Saddam's bunkers in the early weeks of the war and
assassination plan cloaked in euphemisms about "targeting command and
control centers" but confirmed by National Security Advisor Brent
Scowcroft after the war. The scheme failed, thanks to the Iraqi
leader's foresight in moving into an unremarkable house in a
middle-class Baghdad suburb at the outbreak of hostilities, and the
U.S. has been grappling with the consequences ever since.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, little has changed since then-President George Bush
issued his infamous cease-fire order on Feb. 28, 1991. There have
been few alterations in the cast of characters, from Saddam himself
and his more visible henchmen (except, of course, his favorite and
son-in-law, Hussein Kamel, murdered after unwisely returning from
exile in 1996), to the leading lights on the home team, such as
Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz. The same questions that echoed around high-security
situation rooms 11 years ago are still being asked and left
unanswered today: Who would rule Iraq after Saddam? Would the state
dissolve, to the profit of the Iranians and other neighbors? What
would our Arab allies make of a U.S. offensive? Is Iraq really a
threat to us anyway?</TE>
<TE>   Without apparent regard for these deafening political overtones,
U.S. military preparations for Desert Storm: the Sequel are grinding
forward (notwithstanding persistent foot dragging by the Joint Chiefs
of Staff). Assuming for the sake of argument that the operation goes
ahead some time next winter, those involved would do well to pack
Sandra Mackey's "The Reckoning," an admirably lucid history of Iraq,
in their knapsacks. Passing through the days of the ancient
Babylonian and Assyrian empires, whose glorious legacy has been
disinterred by recent Baghdad rulers, notably Saddam himself,
whenever they find it useful, she devotes keen attention to the
mosaic of peoples and cultures that the British hammered into a state
for their own convenience in 1923. In particular, Mackey charts the
evolution of Iraqi Shiism, which, she points out, became the dominant
Muslim sect in what is now southern Iraq only in the 19th century,
generating a center of resistance to the Sunni Ottoman Turkish
empire, which in turn structured its local rule on the Sunni Arab
minority.</TE>
<TE>   The British infamously encouraged Arab nationalism as a weapon
against the Ottomans in World War I, before welshing on the deal by
dividing up Arab lands with the French as spoils of victory. Greedy
for its abundant oil reserves, the British made sure to garner
Mesopotamia, as the area was then known, which they then cobbled into
a new country they called Iraq; to rule they selected a king, Faisal
I, a veteran of the Arab revolt who happened to be conveniently
unemployed. For Faisal's coronation, his British sponsors hurriedly
constructed a throne out of packing cases still carrying the imprint
"Asahi Beer," while a British military band played "God Save the
King," there being as yet no Iraqi national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was there much of a country. The Kurds inhabiting the northern
mountains objected to their inclusion in the new entity and had to be
brought into line with poison gas dispensed on villages by the
(British) Royal Air Force. The Shiite majority was hardly less
disaffected, thanks to its exclusion from power, which was reserved
for the Sunni elite together with a clique composed of the king's old
friends from the days of the revolt against the Turks. The mass of
people in the countryside owed allegiance more to their tribal
leaders than to the artificial administration in Baghdad. At the
lower end of the social order, the peasantry, particularly the
Shiites, lived in privation exacerbated by extreme social inequality:
In 1947 two-thirds of the land was owned by just 2,500 people. Not
long before he died, a weary King Faisal complained that "There is
still ... no Iraqi people, but an unimaginable mass of human beings
devoid of any patriotic ideas, imbued with religious traditions and
absurdities, connected by no common tie, giving ear to evil, prone to
anarchy, and perpetually ready to rise up against any government
whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Mackey is always sure-footed in charting these social tensions
while keeping us engrossed in what is often a tale of murder, hatred,
intrigue, massacre and occasional entertaining absurdity. The
favorite sport of the playboy King Ghazi, Faisal's successor, for
example, was to wire up cigarette boxes, drink trays and other
household items in the palace so as to give electric shocks to guests
who touched them. The leader of the Kurdish Barzani tribe was killed
in 1908 when his followers threw him out of an upstairs window "to
test if he was the Mahdi and if, as such, he could fly."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately the creaky edifice of the monarchy collapsed in the
very bloody 1958 revolution, ushering in a decade of military rule
with the once obscure Baath Party remorselessly extending its
influence, thanks in large part to the ruthless proficiency in
intelligence and torture of a professional assassin and a Sunni
Muslim named Saddam Hussein. In 1968 the Baath Party stepped in to
take power. Saddam was already the power behind the throne before
formally seizing the presidency with a bloody purge in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dark and macabre story, and while Mackey brilliantly
packages the complicated details, she does not lose sight of her
underlying theme: Iraq's lack of a national identity, as denoted by
the continuing disaffection of the Kurds and Shiites with domination
by the Sunnis, most notably Saddam's henchmen from his hometown of
Tikrit. Even so, Mackey perhaps makes a little much of divisions
among the communities, leaving the impression that they have been at
one another's throats for centuries. In fact, their disputes have
been with the central government, not with one another. The present
state of Iraq may have been made up of three formerly separate
Turkish vilayets but, even under Ottoman rule, they were closely
connected by trade and by tribes and clans who had people in all
three.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary history of Iraq that she relates will be a more
familiar tale to many readers: the eight-year war with Iran, the
invasion of Kuwait and the sanctions that followed the Gulf War. As
she points out, the embargo has killed a lot of Iraqis, especially
children, while corrupting Iraqi society, creating a lost generation
of young people who have known only war and deprivation and,
ironically, teaching the Iraqi people that the U.S. may be as much
their enemy as Saddam himself.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate cruelty of sanctions has been of course that, despite
public protestations in Washington to the contrary, they were never
intended to lead to the overthrow of Saddam. Rather the aim, as it
was explained to me at the CIA in 1991, was to keep Iraq weak (with
the bonus of keeping Iraqi oil off the market to the benefit of our
Saudi and Kuwaiti allies.) With a demonized Saddam still in power in
Baghdad, the policy was relatively easy to sell.</TE>
<TE>   This approach was endorsed by at least one influential ally. As
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, then Israeli deputy chief of staff, explained in
a Maariv interview in 1992, " ... Iraq will always be the same, bent
on defying the entire world. Therefore, if I have to choose between a
boycotted Iraq with Saddam and an Iraq without Saddam again supported
by the entire world, then I opt for Saddam, because Saddam will never
be helped by anyone."</TE>
<TE>   With pronouncements like this floating around, it is little wonder
that many Iraqis were able to reach the conclusion that the United
States and Israel were not only happy to have Saddam stay in power
but that there was actual collusion between the dictator and his
alleged enemies. "I tell you, Mr. Andrew," friends have whispered to
me in Baghdad, "Saddam Hussein is an agent of your CIA, and he is
guarded by agents of the Israeli secret service!" Given that the CIA
was active in supporting the February 1963 coup that gave the Baath
its first foothold to power ("We had all the Is dotted and Ts crossed
on that one," the former head of the agency's Mideast division once
told me with considerable satisfaction) and may have rendered further
assistance thereafter, this apparently implausible notion does not
sound so farfetched from an Iraqi perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The United States did make some half-hearted attempts to sponsor a
coup in Baghdad during the 1990s, all easily dealt with by Saddam's
vigilant agents. Only since the advent of the second Bush
administration has rhetoric been supplemented by what appears to be
serious planning for military action. As President George W. Bush has
remarked with fatuous braggadocio: "We're taking him out."</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, little sign that any serious thought has been
given to the kind of Iraq that would emerge from the rubble, and
Mackey has dark forebodings that the country may be torn apart in the
process. Her critical observations on the evident link between a
renewed war with Iraq and America's unquestioning support for
Israel's treatment of its Palestinian subjects are sure to draw
criticism in this country, though the Arab world will have no trouble
in making the connection. She pleads for American policymakers "to
understand the real Iraq" rather than proceeding on the basis "of
some exaggerated expectations that the removal of the despot of
Baghdad will solve all of Iraq's problems and all the challenges to
the United States in the Persian Gulf."</TE>

<LD>COUNTING STARS</LD>
<LD>   By David Almond</LD>
<LD>   Delacorte: 206 pp., $16.95</LD>
<TE>   In this evocative collection of autobiographical vignettes, David
Almond's writing exudes the same haunting mood that characterizes his
novels ("Skellig," "Kit's Wilderness," "Heaven Eyes"). Here, readers
can trace connecting threads between his published works and his
childhood experiences as a sensitive, pensive English child
preoccupied by the mysteries of religion, death and immortality.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than moving linearly, the stories, set in the author's
predominantly Catholic neighborhood, provide a spinning carousel of
surreal images connecting different eras and piecing together
fragments of memories. Town outcasts seem to change form as Almond
reveals their poignant histories. Family members who die untimely
deaths make surprising reappearances ("The week after our sister
Barbara died she was seen walking hand in hand with Mam on this road
toward the field .... [They] walked with a fluency which neither had
in their lives, for Barbara had been an invalid child and Mam was
already badly damaged by arthritis").</TE>
<TE>   Mam reemerges in one tale as a vibrant young dancer when her son
gazes at an old photograph taken during her girlhood. In another,
three deceased family members each define the word "death."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of every selection, readers will feel the presence of
the budding young writer gracefully, yet often sadly, riding waves of
change while trying to make sense of the world around him. The
montage of scenes "merge[s] memory and dream, the real and the
imagined, truth and lies" and expresses pearls of wisdom that will
remain fixed in readers' imaginations. (Ages 10 and up)</TE>

<TE>   PANDORA</TE>
<TE>   By Robert Burleigh</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Raul Colon</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt/Silver Whistle: 32 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   This superbly illustrated and tersely relayed retelling of the
Greek myth from the team behind "Hercules" emphasizes Pandora's
compulsion to know rather than to disobey.</TE>
<TE>   Pandora's curiosity about the jar did not lessen.</TE>
<TE>   Oh no, not at all!</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it grew, like a clinging vine,</TE>
<TE>   Tighter and tighter around her waking thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Colon pays homage to classical Greek forms in his serene and
powerful artwork; the paintings return to Pandora's statuesque
proportions and draped garments as faithfully as her thoughts return
to the mysterious contents of the magnificent jar.</TE>
<TE>   Verdant laurel trees give shade from a hot Greek sun; fine lines
etched onto the borders of the drawings resemble the crackling in the
glaze of ancient urns. Even the climactic scenes possess a
stop-action quality; the restraint of the compositions offers a
tantalizing contrast to the force of Pandora's obsession.</TE>
<TE>   Some young readers may be put off by the story's eerie development
and the gorgons of evil that stream forth from Pandora's jar, but
most will be drawn in, willy-nilly, by Robert Burleigh's hypnotic
text and Colon's remarkable work. (Ages 5-8)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUEENIE FARMER HAD FIFTEEN DAUGHTERS</TE>
<TE>   By Ann Campbell</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Holly Meade</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt/Silver Whistle: 32 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   Ann Campbell ("Dora's Box") extends an invitation to enter the
realm of the fairy and folk tale, with generous doses of humor: "The
day that Queenie Farmer gave birth to fifteen daughters, her beloved
prize cows got loose. Mr. Farmer went after them and never came
back."</TE>
<TE>   The action unfolds around several of Queenie's daughters'
birthdays, when the girls make requests of their mother, which she
obliges willingly ("Her girls asked for so little, and Queenie wanted
to give them so much").</TE>
<TE>   The tasks always take her six days, with the payoff on Sunday.
When she is asked to make 15 birthday cakes for their sixth birthday,
for example, Mrs. Farmer grinds flour on Monday, collects eggs on
Tuesday and so forth, until, "On Sunday, the Farmer girls ate
cake--five chocolate layer cakes, four yellow sponge cakes, three
pound cakes, two ice cream cakes, and one angel food cake" (always a
countdown from five to one).</TE>
<TE>   The girls up the ante as they mature, so that Queenie ends up
going out to find 15 husbands for her girls and then baby-sitting
their 55 offspring on Sundays. Queenie's indisputable love, energy
and ingenuity permeate the tale, while Holly Meade ("Hush! A Thai
Lullaby") makes the most of the simultaneously born siblings, the
seven-day motif and Queenie's comical yearning for her lost Holsteins
(she dresses herself and her "herd" of daughters in black and white).</TE>
<TE>   Like the narrative, the artwork mirrors the ebb and flow of life.
In the end, it's Queenie's turn, as she happily paints Holsteins all
week long (till Sunday, of course). (Ages 3-7)</TE>

<HD>What's Love Got to Do With It?</HD>
<DH>THE SEXUAL LIFE OF CATHERINE M., By Catherine Millet,
Translated from the French by Adriana Hunter, Grove Press: 210 pp.,
$23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIO VARGAS LLOSA</AU>
<BD>Mario Vargas Llosa is the author of numerous works,
including "The Feast of the Goat: A Novel" and "Letters to a Young
Novelist."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legend has it that on his wedding night, the young Victor Hugo made
love eight times to his chaste wife, Adele Foucher. As a result of
this record-breaking feat by the impassioned author of "Les
Miserables," his bride was left staunchly opposed to this type of
activity. (Her winding adulterous adventure with the
less-than-attractive Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve had more to do
with spite and revenge than carnal pleasure.)</LD>
<LD>   Scholar Jean Rostand laughed upon hearing this account of Hugo,
comparing it to feats in fornication achieved by other animal
species. For example, the romantic bard's eight consecutive effusions
pale in comparison to the 40 days and 40 nights during which the male
ape copulates with the female without resting for a single moment.
However, thanks to a seasoned Frenchwoman, Catherine Millet,
amphibians, rabbits and the other great fornicators of the animal
kingdom may have met their match in the lowly human species: someone
capable of measuring up to them--alas, even defeating them in gross
quantity of copulations.</LD>
<TE>   Who is this Catherine Millet? A distinguished art critic, 53 years
old, the Parisian editor of ArtPress and the author of works on such
themes as conceptual art, painter Yves Klein, designer Roger Tallon,
contemporary art and avant-guard criticism. In 1989 she was the
commissioner of the French section of the Sao Paolo Biennial and, in
1995, commissioner of the French Pavilion of the Venice Biennial. Her
fame, however, is much more recent. It is the result of a sexual
autobiographical book, "The Sexual Life of Catherine M.," which has
caused considerable commotion (Le Monde called it "absolutely
staggering") and topped the bestseller list in France for a number of
weeks, selling 350,000 copies. It has been eagerly awaited in America
ever since Francine du Plessix Gray praised the French edition nearly
a year ago, in the pages of Vogue, as being possessed of a style "as
elegant as any French pornography since Sade." Edmund White called it
"the most explicit book about sex ever written by a woman ... that is
the opposite of lurid."</TE>
<TE>   I will say right now that the work of Millet is of much greater
merit than one might glean from the ridiculous uproar that has helped
to publicize it and also that those who venture to read it solely for
the erotic or pornographic halo that adorns it will be disappointed.
The book is neither a sexual stimulant nor a processed imagery of
erotic ritual but an intelligent reflection, crude, unusually frank,
that at moments adopts the clinical prose of a medical report. The
author approaches her own sex life with the icy obsessive detail of
miniaturists who build ships inside bottles or paint landscapes on
the heads of pins. I will also say that this book, while an
interesting and valiant work, is not exactly pleasant to read, for
the reader is left with a vision of sex that is nearly as exhausting
and depressing as that which Madame Hugo suffered following the
marital attacks of her wedding night.</TE>
<TE>   Millet began her sex life at 17, rather late for a girl of her
generation--that of the great May 1968 social revolution. But she
began immediately to make up for lost time, making love right and
left, in every possible region of her body, at a truly maddening
pace, until reaching numbers that I imagine must have far exceeded
the thousands of women whom the compulsive liar Georges Simenon, in
his autobiography, boasts of having taken to bed.</TE>
<TE>   I insist on the numbers because she does so herself in the lengthy
first part of her book, titled simply, "The Numbers Game," where she
documents her predilection for partouzes, promiscuous sex and group
orgies. In the '70s and '80s, before the sexual liberation movement
lost momentum and fell out of fashion all over Europe with the
arrival of AIDS, Millet--described as a timid woman, disciplined and
rather meek, who in sexual relations found a means of communication
with her partners seldom achieved in other aspects of her life--made
love in private clubs, in the Bois de Boulogne, on the shoulders of
highways, in the vestibules of buildings, on public benches, in
private homes and once in the rear of a truck, where she serviced
dozens of applicants in just a few hours with the help of her friend
Eric, who managed the line outside.</TE>
<TE>   I say "applicants" because I don't quite know what to call the
author's fleeting and anonymous partners. They aren't clients, of
course, because Millet, although she lavished her favors with a
boundless generosity, never charged for them. For her, sex was always
enjoyment, sport, routine, pleasure but never profession or business.
In spite of the abandon with which she carried on, she claims that
she was not once the victim of brutality, nor did she ever feel in
danger. Even in potentially aggressive situations, she would simply
voice her displeasure so that her sentiments were respected. She had
lovers, and now has a husband: a writer and photographer who has just
published a book of nudes of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a lover is someone with whom one assumes a somewhat stable
relationship, whereas most of Millet's sex partners appear as
silhouettes in passing, seized and carelessly abandoned, almost
without the slightest conversation between the two. Individuals
without name, without face, without history, the men who parade
through this book are, much like the furtive vulvas of libertine
novels, little more than transitory penises. Until now, in
autobiographical literature, it was only libertine men who made love
in this fashion, blindly and in bulk, caring little about their
partners. This book shows us that we are highly mistaken in adhering
to the notion that chain sex, that is, sex strictly as carnal
gymnasium, void of any sentiment or emotion, is the exclusive right
of men. This may in fact be the most scandalous conceit in the book.</TE>
<TE>   I should mention that Millet does not in these pages make the
slightest display of being a feminist. She does not proclaim her rich
experience in sexual material as a victory flag, nor is it an
accusation against the sexual prejudice and discrimination which
women still suffer today. Her testament is void both of harangue and
of the slightest pretension to illustrate any general, ethical,
political or social truth. On the contrary, her individualism is
extreme and quite visible in its penchant for not making valid
conclusions for everyone based on her own personal experience,
undoubtedly because she does not believe these conclusions exist. Why
has she made public, then, via a sexual self-autopsy without
precedent, that very intimacy males and females hide under lock and
key? It would appear that it is to see if we can better understand it
this way, if it offers enough perspective to change that dark well of
first moves, ecstasies, courages, excesses and confusion into
knowledge into clear and coherent ideas. For despite the air of
liberty she has ascribed to it, for Millet, it is all still sex.</TE>
<TE>   The most disconcerting thing about this memoir is the coldness
with which it is written. The prose is efficient, lucid and often
abstract. But this coldness doesn't merely pervade expression and
reason. It is also the material, the sex itself, which breathes a
cool air and, in many places, depresses. Millet assures us that many
of her associates satisfy her, they help her to materialize her
phantoms, that she enjoys herself with them. But do they really
fulfill her, do they really give her pleasure? The truth is that her
orgasms frequently seem mechanical, resigned and even sad. She
herself implies this in a fairly unequivocal manner, in the final
pages of her book, in which she points out that despite the diversity
of people she has had sex with, she's never felt as sexually
fulfilled as while ("with the punctuality of a functionary")
masturbating. So the extended macho (now, the very fact that this
exists as an adjective is called into discussion) belief that in sex,
pleasure is found only in variation, is not always true. As Millet
might say, none of her countless partners of flesh and bone was able
to dethrone her own spined phantom.</TE>
<TE>   This book confirms what all of sexual literature has shown ad
nauseum: that sex, separate from the other activities and functions
that constitute our existence, is extremely monotone, so limited in
horizon that it ends up dehumanizing. A life polarized by sex alone
reduces the function to a basic organic activity, no more noble or
pleasurable than swallowing or defecating. Only when civilized by
culture, burdened with emotion and passion and clothed with ceremony
and ritual does sex really enrich human life, and only then do its
positive aspects mediate the ups and downs of everyday existence. As
George Bataille explained, for this sublimation to occur, it is
essential that we preserve certain taboos and rules which both
enliven and retard sex, such that physical love can be
experienced--enjoyed--as a transgression. Unrestrained liberty and
the renunciation of all theatricality and formalism in its practice,
which has been presented as a conquest in certain enclaves of the
Western world, have not contributed to enriching the pleasure and
happiness of human beings thanks to sex. It has instead made it
boring and blind, converting physical love into mere gymnastics and
routine.This is one of the most fertile and mysterious sources of the
human phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from this, it helps not to forget that the sexual liberty
displayed with such eloquence in the work of Millet is still the
privilege of few. At the same time I was reading her book, I read in
the Parisian press of the stoning of an Iranian woman whom a tribunal
of fanatic imams had found guilty of appearing in pornographic films.
We should clarify that "pornography" in a fundamentalist Islamic
theocracy consists of a woman showing her hair. The woman, in
accordance with Koranic law, was buried alive in a public square up
to her breasts and stoned to death.</TE>

<DH>THE MAIMED, A Novel,  By Hermann Ungar,  Translated from
the German by Kevin Blahut, Twisted Spoon Press: 222 pp., $14.50
paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS McGONIGLE</AU>
<BD>Thomas McGonigle is the author of "The Corpse Dream of
N. Petkov" and "Going to Patchogue."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christians and Jews have fantasies about each other. Though the
fantasies (or assumptions, you might say) that Christians have about
Jews have been much studied because of their often dire and deadly
consequences, Jewish fantasies about Christians are less
well-studied, though they weave through the novels and stories of
such writers as Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud and through the films
of Woody Allen. In the works of such artists, these fantasies are
usually sexual, harmlessly neurotic and often intensely comic.</LD>
<LD>   Now, thanks to the literary archeology of Prague-based Twisted
Spoon Press, we have a rediscovered novel by Czech Jewish writer
Hermann Ungar, "The Maimed," which focuses on the collision of sexual
obsession and religion in the life of a bank clerk. Originally
published in 1923 and accurately described by Thomas Mann as
depicting "a sexual hell," "The Maimed" is also one of the most
provocative novels I have ever read.</LD>
<LD>   Ungar, the brilliant son of a wealthy brewer from Moravia, was the
author of two novels as well as a few plays and stories. He worked as
the trade attache in the Czech Embassy in Berlin and died in 1929, at
36, of acute appendicitis. "The Maimed" enjoyed modest success upon
its publication but was quietly forgotten in the subsequent years,
which had little time for such a peculiar novel.</LD>
<TE>   "The Maimed" takes us into the mind of Franz Polzer, a bank clerk
for 17 years whose career is meticulously described as one of
routines, fear and more fear (of the outside world and of what might
possibly happen even within his rented room). And of course there had
been the servant girl when he was younger: "Once she met him on the
dark stairwell. He pressed himself into the dark niche, where a
wooden cross of the Savior was hanging. He could no longer flee. She
came to him, and she laughed because she saw that he was afraid of
her. Her hands grasped him. He did not move. Her hands fumbled at his
buttons. Polzer trembled."</TE>
<TE>   When Polzer was at gymnasium, he met Karl Fanta, the Jewish son of
a very rich man, and they became friends though "he [Polzer] knew
that the Jews murdered the Savior and that they worshiped God with
dark cruel customs. He thought it to be sinful and dangerous for a
Roman Catholic to visit the house of a Jew."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of these beliefs, the boys become lifelong friends, but
Karl sickens from some mysterious condition. Eventually, in the
course of this dark novel, he loses his legs and one arm--the
amputation of which is described in gruesome detail, with much
attention given to what will happen to the severed arm. He finds
himself totally dependent upon a wife he aggressively humiliates and
upon the thuggish, muscular servant Sonntag, a former butcher whose
prized possession is a knife that he used to kill his last calf
before becoming ecstatically religious.</TE>
<TE>   For his religious services, Sonntag dresses up in his former
butcher's bloodstained apron and declares: "The blood is on my breast
and the knife beats against my thigh. Thus I have the power to say
the name of Jesus. For there is no other atonement than the one that
comes from taking up one's sins again, for they have not been laid to
rest.... In spirit I suffer again and again the dead for which I bear
the guilt, and thus, with Jesus in my heart, with remorse, humility
and shame, I atone through the debasement of doing it all over
again."</TE>
<TE>   The bedridden Karl ends up living with Sonntag in the same
apartment where Franz has been renting a room from the young widow,
Frau Porges, who demands sex from the timid clerk in exchange for his
room. The level of creepiness is epitomized when Franz notices,
during one of her assaults on him, how "her ears lay flatly against
her head.... They were yellow like the wax of church candles, dead
flattened ears."</TE>
<TE>   One thing leads to another, of course, and the landlady becomes
pregnant. Franz watches her, thinking: "Her belly breathed with her.
The child in her belly was breathing, the living child. Soon her
belly would be opened and the child would lie before Polzer, naked,
with tubular limbs and deep creases in the flesh at the joints ....
No he did not want it."</TE>
<TE>   Murder arises from this desperate situation, but Ungar is unclear
about the identity of the perpetrator or what exactly happens. The
publishers, however, have supplied both the original ending of the
novel, in which the identity of the perpetrator is ambiguous, and a
rejected final chapter that removes any ambiguity as to who ends up
using Sonntag's knife.</TE>
<TE>   "The Maimed" is surely part of the necessary background to the far
more accomplished work of Franz Kafka, Robert Musil and the
under-appreciated Robert Walser. The disturbing sexuality, the
obsessiveness and isolated condition of the characters all seem a
little too starkly drawn, and that certain seam of ambiguity that is
the hallmark of genius is missing. "The Maimed" is an honorable minor
work of fiction, hinting at the author's future accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Maimed'</TE>
<TE>   Every week he counted his possessions: books, newspapers, old
forms, linen, clothes. He wanted to be certain that nothing had
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Polzer knew that he owned no treasures. There was no doubt that
his belongings, his patched-up linen and his shabby suits, were not
worth very much. It was hard to imagine that anyone might want to
take them. Nevertheless, he could not rid himself of this fear. It
overcame him as soon as darkness fell ....Something was hiding, the
conspiracy breathed from the darkness, and Polzer could not do
anything against it. The attack rasped, breathed, and sulked at the
door....</TE>
<TE>   Polzer longed to share his room with someone, someone whose
presence would silence the menacing solitude.... He heard the bed
creak beneath the burden of Frau Porges's body and decided to ask her
in the morning to allow him to sleep in her room. He wanted to buy a
screen that would separate his bed from hers.</TE>

<HD>The Enigmatic Emperor</HD>
<DH>EMPEROR OF JAPAN: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912, By Donald
Keene, Columbia University Press: 922 pp., $39.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER NOSCO</AU>
<BD>Peter Nosco is a professor of Japanese culture at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second half of the 19th century was the last grand age of
monarchy in Europe and Asia. In England, Victoria reigned from 1837
to 1901. In Germany, Wilhelm II was the last kaiser of the German
Empire, proclaimed in 1871. In China, the Dowager Empress Tz'u-hsi
dominated Chinese court politics from 1860 until her death in 1908.
And in Japan, Mutsuhito reigned as tenno, or emperor, from 1867 until
his death in 1912. Like Victoria, Mutsuhito became synonymous with
his place and time, but while Victoria bequeathed her name to an era,
Mutsuhito inherited his name from his. He is thus known as the Meiji
Emperor, or even more simply as Meiji, "enlightened rule."</LD>
<LD>   Little is known about Meiji's inner life and thoughts because he
kept no diary and few of his letters survive. But his biographers
have worked around this silence in the historical record. Like all
good stories, the narrative of modernity requires a beginning, and it
is common among historians of Japan to begin the story of Japan's
modernization with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, a coup d'etat
engineered by disgruntled daimyo, or feudal lords, from the western
provinces who claimed to be acting in the name of the teenage
emperor.</LD>
<TE>   The young monarch, thus, personifies the young state. At first,
they both were rooted more in the past than in a future whose
outlines were only dimly discerned. But, as Meiji grew in stature and
wisdom, so did Japan, which at his birth was made up of little more
than the islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku and by the time of his
death could lay claim to an empire that included Hokkaido, the Ryukyu
islands, Taiwan and Korea. The erstwhile conservatives who initially
surrounded Meiji came to embrace reforms that cloaked the feudal
polity in the garb of a modern nation-state, much as in public
appearances Meiji himself shunned the traditional robes of his
imperial ancestors for Western military-style garb. Juxtaposing the
modern and rational Meiji period against its Tokugawa forebears,
Meiji emerges as the physically vigorous enlightened paragon of a
militarily robust and scientifically and technologically advanced
nation-state.</TE>
<TE>   Recent biographers are also attracted to Meiji for a more
practical reason: A 13-volume official chronicle of his life was
published in Japan from 1968 to 1977, yielding a treasure trove of
information on the day-by-day activities of Japan's first modern
monarch. We know such details as which well provided the water for
his first bath; when Meiji first used chopsticks, tried painting or
used a microscope; who were the first Europeans he saw face to face
(his father had never seen a European); when he first saw the sea and
Mt. Fuji; when he first drank milk, tasted beef, listened to a
phonograph or looked through a microscope; how often he indulged his
passion for horseback riding; whom he honored by pouring sake with
his own hand; and how tall he was--but not how much he weighed, about
which he was sensitive--at the time of his death.</TE>
<TE>   We also know that he was a heavy drinker and an avid observer of
military maneuvers despite an apparent dislike of war, cared deeply
about his subjects' well-being, was indifferent to his personal
comforts and had an aversion to doctors.</TE>
<TE>   We encounter poignant reminders of how different Meiji's world was
from our own. For example, it is said he refused to allow electric
lights in his private quarters in the palace, owing to his concern
over fire. And we learn that in his personal life, Meiji had 15
children by five women, none of whom was his wife, and that of the
15, only four daughters and a son survived infancy.</TE>
<TE>   This sea of detail notwithstanding, as Donald Keene repeatedly
reminds us in his definitive account of Meiji's life and times,
"Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912," it is remarkable
how elusive Meiji the man remains. There are no more than a handful
of surviving photographs of him, despite his being by far the most
public Japanese monarch in more than a millennium, and almost nothing
in his handwriting survives, despite there being 100,000 poems
attributed to him.</TE>
<TE>   Keene reminds us that we know nothing of Meiji's feelings over the
deaths of his children, whether he ever entertained the wish to
travel abroad or even whether he liked or disliked his commissioned
portrait by Eduardo Chiossone. On political matters, Meiji is even
more opaque. Thus, even though we know that he was present during
hundreds of meetings that determined virtually every important event
in the growth of the new state and that he regarded his attendance at
such meetings as an important part of his duty, it appears that he
typically said nothing during these gatherings. One thus knows little
or nothing about his political stances or reactions. Meiji's opinion
on such matters appears to have been consulted only when necessary to
break deadlocks between politicians or between the cabinet and
legislature and, even in such instances, his counsel only
occasionally succeeded in putting an end to bickering.</TE>
<TE>   One searches for examples of the exercise of imperial
authority--after all, we are told that in 1868 he was "restored" to
direct rule--yet the best examples we find are his involvement in the
decisions against making peasants pay taxes in rice, against seeking
a foreign loan and for using a chrysanthemum (instead of a rising
sun) to decorate the boundary marker separating Japanese from Russian
territory in Sakhalin.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more troubling for those who would embrace an image of
imperial agency is the fact that, time and again, Meiji's expressed
views on matters large and small were either ignored or defied. He
appears to have been vigorously opposed to the Sino-Japanese War of
1894-95, although once hostilities commenced, he sought to support
the troops through a variety of public gestures. He apparently had
great difficulty in 1896 over as simple a matter as ordering a
20-minute postponement of his train's departure from Kyoto Station
for Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   It is thus understandable that Keene's biography of Meiji is as
much, if not more, about Meiji's times than about the man himself,
and it is here that the volume's greatest strengths are to be found.
Keene provides an utterly brilliant exposition of Japanese history
from about 1850 until Meiji's death in 1912. The broad strokes of
this narrative have long been well known, but it is Keene's
day-by-day detail that makes this the best history in English of the
emergence of modern Japan and that will happily require the rewriting
of many a university lecture.</TE>
<TE>   All the key events are here in striking detail. From the arrival
of Commodore Matthew Perry to the departure of the Iwakura Mission
overseas, from the turbulent early post-Restoration years to the
establishment of a stable state with a parliament and a constitution,
from the struggle to revise a series of unequal treaties to the
emergence of a colonial empire, and from the rise of politics to the
demise of successive generations of political leaders, there is no
important event in modern Japanese history on which Keene does not
shed new light.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Keene comes uncomfortably close to the perspectives of
the time and place he studies, so that one reads about Taiwanese
"savages" and "high-handed" Koreans or how King Sho Tai of the Ryukyu
Islands, forcibly exiled to Japan, welcomed the opportunity to be
removed from the political bickering back home. But for a work of
such length, instances like these are remarkably few.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are the silences in the historical record, and these
silences have their implications. When one tries to "see" the history
of a period as richly variegated as that of Meiji Japan through the
prism of Meiji himself, and when one acknowledges in the end that the
man at the apparent center of affairs remains something of an enigma,
one can easily slip into the dangerous conception that the history
also is enigmatic. To his credit, Keene never lapses into such
mystification.</TE>
<TE>   Keene is well known as the world's foremost authority on Japanese
literature, although it is less well known that his first scholarly
monograph was a superb look at the 18th and 19th century study of
Europe by Japanese scholars who were themselves forbidden from
traveling abroad. Keene, in turn, has done the reverse, dedicating
his life to the introduction of Japan to those who live elsewhere.
With his study of Meiji, Keene has come full circle--he has returned
to his first love, the writing of history, and he has done so
brilliantly and with all the dignity befitting his subject.</TE>

<LD>MISERABLE MIRACLE</LD>
<LD>   By Henri Michaux</LD>
<LD>   New York Review Books:</LD>
<TE>   180 pp., $13.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps Michaux has never tried to express anything," the late
Octavio Paz wrote of the poet in an essay reprinted as the
introduction to this volume. "All his efforts have been directed at
reaching that zone, by definition indescribable and incommunicable,
in which meanings disappear. A center at once completely empty and
completely full."</TE>
<TE>   Between 1956 and 1959, Henri Michaux wrote three books describing
his experiences with mescaline. The text, written during each
experience, is accompanied by line drawings that are alarming in
their immediacy. They provide another language for Michaux to convey
his terror, pleasure and sheer enervation. In the text, he wrestles
with language: "I turn the pages: Nothing. I shake the volume trying
to make the loose pages fall out," he writes, after hallucinating
colorful pictures in a book with no illustrations. He is astonished
by "the phenomenon of ideas gravitating like planets ... An idea
arrives, quickly ceases to exist. When it returns a few minutes later
it seems absolutely new."</TE>
<TE>   While he is tripping, there is an overwhelming sense of connection
with the universe and its geologic beginnings: of fire, of the
trembling Earth, of ocean torrents and whistling wind. But a reader
has the raw feeling that Michaux is being chased by language, that
the words come just a few minutes later than the experience, and by
then they are a little stale. The drawings, however, come from the
epicenter. They resemble at first electrocardiograms, then eerie
indecipherable kanji and, finally, word landscapes, letters melting
into horizons and dripping down mountainsides.</TE>
<TE>   With the epiphanies come some God-time-infinite-being
psychobabble, ideas that are either unformed or inaccessible, but
there is always the possibility that he speaks in the tongue of
angels, and for that possibility, it is worth diving headlong into
his experience.</TE>

<TE>   MANHATTAN MONOLOGUES</TE>
<TE>   Stories</TE>
<TE>   By Louis Auchincloss</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 226 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   The high society that Louis Auchincloss writes about is
Chekhovian, tainted with desperation, distraught over the gradual
loss of its entitlements. His characters are utterly unlikable down
to the last heiress; they are bitter and disenfranchised and cynical;
marriage is an arrangement, children are pawns and blue blood runs
like ice water in constricted veins.</TE>
<TE>   Besides unlikable characters, there are just too many adjectives;
the dialogue is dense with chit-chat that swamps potentially
interesting ideas. Take, for example, war as a test of manliness in
the story "All That May Become a Man." In the last paragraph, the
narrator says to the reader, "I could never compete in a woman's eyes
with a hero," a thought that might have carried the story had it not
been quite so deeply buried.</TE>
<TE>   Here is an example of the kind of obfuscation that Auchincloss
indulges in: "The shock to me was such as to throw me into a kind of
nervous breakdown, which may have necessitated my going for a time to
a sanitorium, had not a stern talk with my mother formed the
beginning of what looked to be a cure, or at least an alleviation."
Writing like this will doom a writer to mid-list. Characters,
Auchincloss' only hope in his world, get eaten in the machine of the
mystique, which is, in all fairness, what happens in real life. But
we expect more from fiction.</TE>

<TE>   THE SUMMER OF MY GREEK TAVERNA</TE>
<TE>   A Memoir</TE>
<TE>   By Tom Stone</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 245 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   It has been too long since our last good food-and-life books. I
think of John Lanchester's "The Debt to Pleasure" or "Pass the
Polenta" by Theresa Lust, not to mention the writings of M.F.K.
Fisher or Elizabeth David. Now and then it is good to have these
elegant reminders of slow meals and adventurous appetites.</TE>
<TE>   "The Summer of My Greek Taverna" is also an expatriate's tale, the
story of a writer and a painter and their two young children trying
to live in a place that inspires them. Tom Stone adds something to
his chosen genre: graphic descriptions of his own querulous doubt at
each new decision. It is too easy to forget, in the Peter Mayle
world, that these lives require a great deal of risk. There is never
enough money, never enough security, and always one is forced to run
on instinct: to trust strangers selling houses and, in Stone's case,
Greeks bearing gifts. To stick to the dream.</TE>
<TE>   I have come to believe that these memoirs, well and honestly
written like Stone's, are extremely important; for some of us, a map
of the road not taken.</TE>

<LD>A THING OR TWO ABOUT CURTIS AND CAMILLA</LD>
<LD>   By Nick Fowler</LD>
<LD>   Pantheon: 398 pp., $24.95</LD>
<TE>   The first half of Nick Fowler's ambitious, irresistibly melodic
debut novel about love in lower Manhattan resonates like a perfect
pop song: You just want to revisit it over and over again. Fowler, a
former musician, knows how to set up an unforgettable hook and then
drum it, like Bun E. Carlos, into our heads. And his writing is
studded with the kind of casually cosmic insights that parallel
universe rock stars might offer to Rolling Stone: "We know we're
grown-ups when we stop resisting the urge to become a cliche." "We
think abstraction is a detour, but maybe it's our saving grace."</TE>
<TE>   This is how Curtis, Fowler's down-and-out songwriter narrator,
talks. And in Curtis' story of "gooey love," which begins when he
runs into the model-esque Camilla and her little dachshund on Houston
Street, even gray New York is magically transformed: "Manhattan had
removed that stick of straw from its teeth and [was] now blowing her
pheromones into the wind like the fluffy spokes of a dandelion." The
energy is infectious as Curtis and Camilla blossom together. Of
course, it all goes to hell, and when it does, this remarkable book
launches into its B side: the wacky ballad of Curtis, post-Camilla,
complete with Rogaine jokes, animal rights vigilantes and an
over-the-top Indian quack doctor. It's funny stuff, but the melodies
are strained, as if Fowler had somehow become as desperate as his
heartbroken hero. But the A side--an invigorating blast of
originality, wit and heart--is a smash.</TE>

<TE>   NARCISSUS ASCENDING</TE>
<TE>   By Karen McKinnon</TE>
<TE>   Picador USA: 212 pp., $21</TE>
<TE>   Karen McKinnon's curious debut novel was inspired by Christopher
Lasch's "The Culture of Narcissism," the celebrated book that wrung
its hands over Americans' tendencies toward self-obsession. It's not
surprising, then, that "Narcissus Ascending" comes across as a mildly
fanciful case study, its bite-sized sentences roaming with terse
authority over a group of overstimulated friends on Manhattan's Lower
East Side.</TE>
<TE>   And what a grim cast they are, incessantly rehashing their days at
Berkeley, making appointments with their herbalists and, most of all,
nurturing their gossipy obsession with Callie, the beautiful
ex-friend who has betrayed each of them. If the manipulative,
crisis-prone Callie is the book's Narcissus, then Becky, the artist
who makes awful-sounding photo collages, is its ascending: As she
prepares her first big gallery show and assents to a plan to wreak
payback upon Callie, Becky threatens to turn into Callie II: the new
focus of the group's awe, anxiety and envy. And when Becky's and
Callie's roles become scrambled--and their images entwine in one of
Becky's works--we actually begin to feel sorry for the dreaded
Callie. It's this moment--when Callie's hold upon her friends extends
to the reader--that "Narcissus Ascending" leaps beyond its own
self-reflective, front-loaded obsessions. Otherwise, one wishes
McKinnon would have held up a cosmetic mirror to the clipped prose
that makes this promising story little more than a psychoanalytic
soap opera.</TE>

<TE>   LOSING GEMMA</TE>
<TE>   By Katy Gardner</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead: 312 pp., $13 paper</TE>
<TE>   "Backpackers who treated the world as a vast global playground,
laid on for their personal thrills and adventure, ran the risk of
being violently disabused." This is Esther, recalling the fateful
backpacking journey through India that she and her best friend,
Gemma, took in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In Katy Gardner's devourable first novel, a kind of a
subcontinental "The Comfort of Strangers," these twentysomething
English women learn this bitter lesson in ways that constantly
surprise the reader and themselves. In fact, it becomes downright
deadly, as Gemma falls deliriously ill in a remote Indian outpost,
refuses Esther's attempts to remove her to a safer place and decides
to throw her lot in with Coral, a creepy Australian backpacker and
possible cult member. Stung by this betrayal, Esther leaves her best
friend in Coral's care, only to return in a panic to find what looks
like Gemma's charred body in the overgrown thickets surrounding the
ruins of an ancient temple.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing Gemma" isn't so much about potentially hazardous strangers
as it is about the promises and perils of friendship. What Gardner
offers here, amid the exotic scenery and disintegrating sense of
middle-class entitlement, is a convincing travelogue of the heart, in
which two lifelong friends evolve against a strange backdrop, and one
of them--it becomes increasingly unclear which--is left behind.</TE>

<DH>THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL: Hollywood in the Fifties, By Sam
Kashner and Jennifer MacNair, W.W. Norton: 352 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is a contributing writer to Book
Review. His latest television documentary, a profile of director
Samuel Fuller, premieres on Turner Classic Movies in July.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Bad and the Beautiful" borrows its title from Vincente
Minnelli's darkly romantic, ultimately forgiving 1952 portrait of a
manipulative, infuriating Selznick-like producer. As is that film,
the book is divinely unconscious of its own deeper implications; it's
merely out for a good time, breathlessly recounting the antique dish
that surrounded Hollywood's panicky economic and popular decline in
the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   The authors dimly suspect that television's replacement of the
movies as America's mass medium of choice--the latter eventually lost
two-thirds of its audience to the former--had something to do with
the town's apparent descent into widely reported dysfunction, but
that's about it for a controlling idea in their work. They can tell
us who was sticking it to whom, but they can't tell us why that
should matter to us at this late date.</LD>
<TE>   Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair begin with an account of the fast
rise and equally fast demise of Confidential magazine, the creation
of "bottom-feeding" publisher Robert Harrison, whose previous
experience was with skin magazines that included Wink and Titter.
Seeing that the hard-pressed studios--no longer keeping stars under
long-term contracts, thus lacking long-term interest in their
well-being--were losing control over how their privates lives were
presented to the public, Harrison used scuzzy informers to dig up
what he and his readers deemed to be their juicier secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of homosexual behavior were especially interesting to him,
as were stories of interracial heterosexual liaisons. But, hey,
someone's buried prison record or a hint that this or that
personality had appeared nude in public (or had been seen necking in
a nightclub) were equally appealing. And Howard Rushmore, his chief
"investigative" reporter, a former communist turned crazily
anti-communist, was viciously active on the political front.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, Kashner and MacNair are not as dismayed by this publication
as they might be. The magazine, they write, "proved that most
mainstream reporting was like a thrown fight, with too many pulled
punches .... [P]eople wanted, needed to see the other side of the
klieg lights; stars without makeup, without glamour, without studio
protection, without the cloak of beauty, wealth, and power." It's
that italicized "needed" that disturbs. What right to know do we
legitimately have when a famous person turns down the lights and
draws the shades?</TE>
<TE>   As long as no public trust--and what public trust does a movie
star have other than to look pretty and entertain divertingly?--is
violated and no crimes (other than those against good taste and
common sense) are committed, why are they not entitled to be left
alone? The struggle for celebrity privacy is, of course, a long-lost
battle. Confidential was stopped when a group of stars, led by the
invaluable Robert Mitchum, who never gave a hoot about his image,
sued for libel, and the magazine agreed to cease and desist in its
scurrilousness. But the damage had been done. The age of the
tabloids, as Kashner and MacNair observe, had been prefigured.</TE>
<TE>   What they do not observe is that Confidential, short-lived and
contemptible though it was, signified the beginning of the end of the
long-standing, basically benign social compact that had governed the
relationship between the movies and the vast majority of their
endlessly bemused public. Though there had been real and scandalizing
crimes involving movie people before, such errant behavior didn't
affect people's unremitting desire to see movies. The censorious
Catholic-dominated movie production code had been a nuisance, a
puerility and a mystery to many--including, of course, liberal-minded
Catholics. But most Americans in the '30 and '40s went on loving
movies in quite a direct and uncomplicated way.</TE>
<TE>   In the culturally bland and contented '50s, though, some sense of
betrayal entered the picture. You can discern this in the response to
the decade's first great movie, "Sunset Boulevard." It was scarcely
the first film to take up the subject of powerful movie players in
self-destructive decline.</TE>
<TE>   But in such previous films as "What Price Hollywood?" and "A Star
Is Born," studio bosses saw to it that when stardom's torch was
passed to the younger generation, a lesson in humility and
self-possession was wrapped around it. This agreed-upon fiction about
Hollywood was essentially sweet-souled and reassuring, and America
took it to heart. It was not prepared for a movie in which the
principals ended up dead or as crazy victims of a cruel uncaring
system. It seemed--how shall we say?--tasteless. "Sunset Boulevard"
was, in 1950, no more than a modest, largely urban success. The stix
nixed it.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider the decade's last great movie, "Sweet Smell of
Success." Until it appeared in 1957, New York was, for Hollywood, a
glamorous dream: penthouses, white telephones, women in shimmering
gowns exchanging bons mots with debonair, tuxedoed males. All of
America bought into that convention. But this film--with Burt
Lancaster's viciously hypocritical gossip columnist and Tony Curtis'
scuttling press agent, conspiring to destroy lives in its
realistically portrayed, noirishly lighted streets and bars--laid
waste the old dream of luxe and lightness. Naturally, a puzzled
America rejected the film; it was a huge flop.</TE>
<TE>   Change was everywhere: The confident idiocy of Henry Aldrich in
his flivver, daubed with slang slogans, gave way to the brooding
sensitivity of James Dean in his rather more deadly hot rod; the calm
righteousness of the western hero was sicklied o'er by doubts about
gunslinging as a trade; where once a career woman like Rosalind
Russell traded wisecracks on an equal footing with Cary Grant, Doris
Day--though still a working girl--schemed to trap him in cozy
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In short, all the movies' ruling equations changed, very
occasionally for the better, more generally for the softer, more
sentimental worse. Sometimes the gossip collected by Kashner and
MacNair illuminates these changes effectively. I suspect that the
heated machismo around the Hecht-Hill-Lancaster offices, which they
detail, contributed something useful to the unyielding scabrousness
of "Sweet Smell." Similarly, the fact that Nicholas Ray apparently
had affairs, as they report, with all three of his young leads--two
male, one female--when he was making "Rebel Without a Cause" added
something to its sentimental, not to say simpering, portrayal of
adolescent angst.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly "The Bad and the Beautiful" fails to make the
connections it ought to make. Its authors, for instance, discuss in
some detail the interracial affair of Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak;
they notice that Sandra Dee's hysterical defense of her teen queen
virginity must have drawn some of its weird fervor from the fact that
she was an abused child; they note that Rock Hudson's cuddlesomeness
curdled because he was obliged to hide his homosexuality. But they do
not see the linkage between the silence and sniggering that attended
these matters and the vast movements and open conflicts they
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same way with movies themselves. They were trying, in the
'50s, to be more self-consciously serious and a little more overtly
sexy, yet somehow they appeared to be more bland and banal. Impatient
with them, the adult audience wandered away; they couldn't wait for
new narrative conventions to evolve and take hold, couldn't wait to
see if their old enthrallment might be reconstituted on a new basis.
By the early '70s, the movies were catering almost exclusively to
their last reliable habitual audience: people 25 and under, from
which stars, incidentally, have even fewer secrets than they had in
the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   There is a great history to be written about how all this began to
happen half a century ago, a compound of nuanced critical analysis
and sensitive social history. But these writers are not up to that
task. They just want to talk trash. And so an opportunity is lost, as
it so often is in writing about the movies. The '50s, in the movies,
in American life generally, are the most enigmatic of modern eras.
What in those days we dismissed or refused soberly to discuss or
pretended did not exist is precisely what we need now to get serious
about if we are to comprehend the world as it has since evolved.</TE>

<DH>THE RUSSIA HAND: A Memoir of Presidential Diplomacy, By
Strobe Talbott, Random House: 480 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDERS STEPHANSON</AU>

University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think Strobe Talbott's title smacks of John le Carre, you are
absolutely right: Russians and Americans in his book seem fascinated
by the tales of the English master of spy fiction, and "The Russia
Hand" suggests one of his twilight experts, put out to pasture at the
academic filiation of the Secret Service in the red-brick expanse of
North Oxford. That red-brick expanse, however, is the only real link
with le Carre's world. For it was at Oxford 30 years ago that Talbott
came to room with Bill Clinton, the unexpected Russia hand in
question.</LD>
<TE>   Always in awe of his friend, the self-effacing Talbott would later
serve Clinton as Russian expert and foreign policy advisor. Talbott's
credentials were impeccable. In the early 1970s, with extensive
training in Russian studies, he smuggled out and translated Nikita
Khrushchev's memoirs. From Moscow he covered the Soviet Union for
Time magazine and became a master of arms control. What he offers us
here is a detailed memoir of the eight years of Clinton dealings with
Russia and Boris Yeltsin in the wake of Soviet disintegration. Told
in a matter-of-fact tone, Talbott's story is an insider's view,
intriguing but also selectively silent to the point of distortion and
suspiciously devoid of analysis. It will jolt you back to a recent
epoch that now seems eons away, to a moment when the "Bill and Boris
Show" was center stage with its dark and unintended hilarity.</TE>
<TE>   Talbott casts Clinton as the nation's chief Russia hand because he
believes Clinton demonstrated in his surprisingly voluminous business
with that troubled country and its equally troubled president,
Yeltsin, that he knew and cared a great deal about its fate. I find
the evidence unconvincing. At no point does the Clinton in Talbott's
book reveal any probing insight or critical awareness regarding the
deeper nature of Russian problems. Endlessly gregarious, endlessly
garrulous, Clinton keeps gushing forth instead about the need to
support "Ol' Boris," as he refers to his pal.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Talbott's Clinton develops a strong and genuine affection
for Yeltsin, in spite, or perhaps because of the Russian president's
often drunken and wildly inappropriate behavior. Yeltsin, Talbott
remembers Clinton saying in the fall of 1993, when the Russian
bombarded the parliament, "has been brave and consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Later, while visiting Russia during Yeltsin's murderous campaign
in Chechnya, Clinton likens him to Lincoln, another politician
presumably trying to suppress illegitimate secession. When the
Russian people persist in electing unpalatable parliamentary
politicians, Clinton wonders when they will ever learn the democratic
ropes and vote for the right kind of people, thus forgetting the
obvious fact that the right kind, his kind, was largely responsible
for the most devastating assault on the living standards of ordinary
Russians since Joseph Stalin in the early '30s and the Nazis in the
early '40s.</TE>
<TE>   Talbott shows Clinton tenaciously clinging to the belief that
Yeltsin is a yearning democrat, whereas the only yearning Yeltsin
actually showed, aside from kleptocratic enrichment of his entourage,
was a desire to destroy the Communist Party, not quite the same thing
in these circumstances as being democratic. His considerable tactical
skills he reserved for the domestic scene, where he played a clever
political game between elite forces to preserve his own rule. In
dealing with the United States and Clinton especially, Yeltsin proved
a servile incompetent. So while Clinton in "The Russia Hand" shows
himself to have a shallow grasp of Russian realities and Yeltsin's
politics, he turns out to be the ultimate Yeltsin hand, handling the
colossally insecure Russian brilliantly while pushing the American
agenda with the greatest success.</TE>
<TE>   A certain routine soon emerges. "Ol' Boris" blusters and shows off
expansively. Talbott aptly calls this part of the performance the
Rodney Dangerfield moment, with Yeltsin bitterly complaining that "my
friend Bill" (a constant term of endearment) and the West have not
been showing Russia, and above all him, Yeltsin, proper respect. If
only Clinton had done so, the present problems would have been taken
care of long ago. Now, luckily, because of their great friendship and
leadership, the wise old team has once again saved the day for the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Saving the day typically means that Yeltsin comes round to
Clinton's original position. While Yeltsin is giving away the farm,
Clinton is only too happy to indulge the Russian's pitiful desire to
plume himself in the cloak of a world leader on equal footing.
Feeling Yeltsin's pain (no doubt truly), Clinton oozes soothing
sympathy. As Talbott says, Yeltsin's grievances are actually put
forth "to disguise how pliant he had been behind closed doors."</TE>
<TE>   Against a backdrop of Russian tumult, the rest of the story is
mainly devoted to Talbott's important dealings with various Russian
counterparts. Conducted in the spirit of Bill and Boris, these
agreements amount to pushing the Russians into accepting, with
cosmetic cover, whatever Talbott and the United States want them to
do. To what end? one might ask.</TE>
<TE>   There were of course acute issues: Bosnia, Kosovo, the bombing of
Russia's Serbian allies, preventing transfer of nuclear technology to
Iran, removing Russian troops from Eastern Europe. But the two
projects that the Clinton administration pushed with extraordinary
perseverance and conviction were the so-called market reforms
(falsely conflated with the cause of democracy) and the expansion of
NATO into, in principle, every conceivable part of the old Soviet
sphere.</TE>
<TE>   The former, in line with Clinton's one consistent foreign policy
overall, market "liberalization," was a hopeless failure and
contributed to a monumental obliteration of public resources in
Russia, along with massive impoverishment of millions of people and
the grimmest destruction of lives without actual physical violence
imaginable. "Market reform" also fueled the scandalously corrupt
transfer of wealth to a small coterie of individuals, members of the
old elite along with some new "oligarchs," who were awarded
staggering amounts of property for a pittance in exchange for
supporting Yeltsin in the crucial presidential election of 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of productive investment, this looting was followed by
enormous capital flight. This "market reform" also turned the Russian
state--because of massive international borrowing--into an abject
problem client of the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Most dominant Western voices favored the self-evident virtues of
market reform: Who could possibly be against it? NATO expansion was
another matter. Some traditionalists claimed that it would dilute the
alliance into an unrecognizable political jumble. They were right. If
it was (barely) credible that an American president would commit
nuclear suicide over West Berlin, would anyone believe he would do so
because of a future conflict between Lithuania and Russia? Yet NATO,
founded as an anti-Soviet alliance, had arguably already lost its
raison d'etre. For the present administration, it has become a mere
political instrument to be used at will.</TE>
<TE>   A second camp argued that it was wrong, or at least imprudent, to
take geopolitical advantage of Russia's temporary decline. Better
then to seek alternatives to NATO and other ways of including Moscow
and Eastern Europe in some new framework of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   This latter route was also followed in a minor key by Clinton to
make the expansion digestible to the Russians. Talbott portrays this
as a compromise, but he also says that when push came to shove, the
administration thought Moscow had no say in NATO expansion. Russian
President Vladimir Putin, doing the best he can with a very weak
hand, has now decided to play along with Washington to open up for
his real goal: long-term integration into Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Progressive diplomats at the United Nations, as I recall, found
Talbott an open-minded, honest and cooperative American policymaker,
a thoroughly decent guy. This is perhaps why he seems incapable of
probing into the private when it is clearly disgusting. Talbott does
not intrude or become polemically critical. He looks away, literally,
from what he does not want to see. When Clinton devastates him with
his wretched Monica Lewinsky affair, Talbott cannot bear to read the
stories. He looks out the window, goes for a jog and then hides the
hurt by burying himself in work. The matter never comes up again.</TE>
<TE>   Talbott also wants what he genuinely thinks is in everybody's best
interests. Precisely because he equates his interests with Russian
interests, however, he can provide no sustained reflection on the
disastrous developments in Russia or on the role of Clinton in them.
Nor can he say anything critical about the painful debasement of the
Russians in terms of professional trade craft.</TE>
<TE>   Some things, nevertheless, slip through the repressive grid.
Talbott is much more enthusiastic about advances in security, such as
NATO expansion, than about advances in markets. An aura of bad
conscience hovers over his account of marketization, though he talks
himself into believing that, errors by Yeltsin aside, the whole
bungle had been the fault of recalcitrant hardliners in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   And then he tells the brief but poignant story of catching up with
his oldest Russian friends, Slava and Rita Luchkov, in one of those
new "garish restaurants" in Moscow. After pushing through "the
hookers, hoods and high rollers" waiting to get into the casino, the
Luchkovs talk with sorrow of the hollow culture of capitalist
Westernized Moscow. Talbott, a Russophile, does not reveal his
response. He merely notes that it was the last time he got to see
Slava Luchkov. The many subsequent trips to Moscow are too hurried,
and within a year Slava is dead "at the age of fifty-seven,
approximately the median age of male mortality in Russia."</TE>

<DH>THE COMPANY: A Novel of the CIA, By Robert Littell,
Overlook Press: 894 pp., $28.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Friday, July 4, 1862, on a golden afternoon, the Rev. Robinson
Duckworth of Trinity College, Oxford, and Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a
fellow of Christ Church College, took Lorina, Edith and 10-year-old
Alice, the daughters of Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church, boating
on the Thames. "On which occasion," Dodgson noted later, "I told them
the fairy tale of Alice's adventures underground." Unlike most
children's stories of that day, the tale that Dodgson told and the
expanded version that he published as Lewis Carroll had no moral and
did not teach anything. Which may account for its success. A
moral-free universe is an important lesson unto itself, especially
when reading Robert Littell's "The Company," even though this hefty
tome shares little of its predecessor's frisky whimsy.</LD>
<TE>   The saga comes to us first as an ill-camouflaged docudrama about
the history of the Cold War. It breaks for commercials on
international conflicts, national and foreign politics, patriotism,
opportunism, treachery and underhanded activity on all sides. It also
offers a gripping tale of derring-do, office politics and intramural
warfare within "the company." Subtitled "A Novel of the CIA" (and of
the KGB, Mossad and MI6), it rides comfortably--though not
comfortingly--on current tides of questions about what our
intelligence agencies achieve. The litany of lapses and precarious
feats that Littell lays out doesn't do much to reassure, but it stirs
empathy in poor souls addicted to fumbling and misjudgment. As W.S.
Gilbert might have said but didn't, "A spook's life is not a happy
one."</TE>
<TE>   "The Company" also provides a trove of tradecraft and trade lore:
"legends," the pseudonyms and pseudo-identities agents assume;
"serials," the fables they try to pass off as information; "cutouts"
that stand between moles and those who handle them; lies and
"fluttering" lie-detector tests. If that's not enough, there are also
deceptions, betrayals, defectors and false defectors, smoke and
mirrors everywhere and quite a lot to drink. Nothing succeeds like
excess, and the CIA is there to prove it. So is "The Company."</TE>
<TE>   Like foreplay, the CIA had to be invented as we went along. Like
foreplay, it had of course been conjured up before. The United States
boasted no peacetime intelligence establishment until after World War
II. The Office of Strategic Services, improvised in 1942, could not
have been expected to predict the attack on Pearl Harbor but it might
have been expected to forecast the German offensive in the Ardennes
in 1944 and the Battle of the Bulge that followed. It didn't. On the
whole, though, stumbling through mined terrain, it proved no more
blunder-prone than other spy covens, and it gave rise, in September
1947, to the Central Intelligence Agency, intended to coordinate all
national security work.</TE>
<TE>   A camel, someone has said, is a horse designed by a committee.
Committees and compromises delivered the CIA as part of a hodgepodge
that includes separate Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence
departments, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security
Agency, State Department intelligence, a Department of Energy nuclear
intelligence unit, the FBI and other morsels of alphabet soup. Soon,
thanks to the Cold War, the new agency grew like Topsy, reaching some
20,000 in the United States and thousands more overseas. Littell
mercifully does not go into these details, though his 1997 novel,
"Walking Back the Cat," seemed to display his views in a nutshell:
"overpriced, inefficient and messy, it makes big mistakes.... But it
happens to be the only intelligence industry we have." And so a lot
of CIA retainers, especially those of the Operations Directorate
better known as the Department of Dirty Tricks, figure in his past
novels.</TE>
<TE>   Still more teem in "The Company's" multitudinous cast. They
include real-life characters like James Jesus Angleton, the obsessive
mole-hunting head of counterintelligence; and semi-fictional
characters that (unlike real-life operatives!) don't mind breaking
rules to press their covert actions in the field. For amateurs of
spy-counterspy doings, there's plenty of dry cleaning (evasive action
to avoid being followed), walking back the cat (going over an
operation to see where it went wrong), wetwork (assassination) and
overall experience, which is what we call our mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   As the Cheshire Cat told Alice: "We're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" Alice asked. "You must be
mad," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here." Here means all
over the place in the CIA's Wonderland: Berlin, Budapest, Rome,
Moscow, Washington, Crimea, the Bay of Pigs and points between,
beginning in 1950, ending in 1995. ) As for Alice et al., Lewis
Carroll is Littell's patron saint. Whiffs of Wonderland waft through
his earlier novels; here its scent is pervasive. The epigraphs are
drawn from her adventures; the KGB pedophile master spy reads his
girl-mistresses sex-time stories and the personal codes of one Soviet
agent (nom de guerre Eugene Dodgson) are lifted from his namesake's
masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 900 pages is a bit protracted for a history lesson,
especially when the book is heavy to hold up in bed. But Littell's
serial conveys none of the tedium of spying and counter-spying:
Excitement sometimes flags but only seldom, his characters come
alive, the moments of suspense work breathlessly even when we know
the outcome (we don't always), relationships vibrate and so does the
writing, reminiscent of John le Carre in his good days.
Appropriately, that master of spy thrillers gets a nod, a wink and a
prayer in the text.</TE>
<TE>   The serial peters out in 1991, not long after the Soviet Empire
petered out and the Cold War with it. Cold or hot, wars do not decide
who's right; they decide who's left. In this case, America won the
war but won the peace only dubiously, as is the case when we pick up
the peaces. Russia, meanwhile, once run by paranoiacs and the KGB, is
run by venture capitalists and other thieves, while Russians yearn
for Stalin's good old days when wages and pensions were paid on time.
The CIA soldiers on as faithfully, as fallibly, as fitfully as ever.
"Everything has a moral," said the Duchess to Alice, "if only you can
find it." Littell has found the moral, and you can find it too, on
the last page: "We screwed up less than they did. That's why we won."</TE>

<HD>Tijuana's Advocate for Change</HD>
<DH>Border: City's planning chief aims to transform the restive
metropolis with small projects followed by great ones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Carlos Graizbord used to shield his eyes when he drove by the dusty
squatter settlements clinging precariously to the hillsides of this
border city.</LD>
<LD>   The dirt roads, the makeshift homes pieced together out of tires
and plywood, the chaotic jumble of neighborhoods that sprouted of
their own accord--all of it was too much.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just the immense poverty that depressed him. It was that
fixing the untamed colonias was up to him. As the new director of
Tijuana's Institute for Municipal Planning, Graizbord had to find a
way to bring order to one of North America's most unruly cities.</LD>
<TE>   Three years later, the illegal shantytowns are still there, but
the determined planning director no longer averts his gaze. His short
tenure so far has given him hope that transforming this sprawling
metropolis--in ways both small and large--is indeed possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no bigger challenge," he said. "Maybe Calcutta. But I do
believe that if we persist with our effort, we can change the city,
slowly."</TE>
<TE>   For evidence, he looks to Avenida Revolucion, the mostly seedy
downtown strip of bars and clubs that is slowly taking on the
appearance of a pleasant pedestrian promenade.</TE>
<TE>   After the city began planting rows of neatly trimmed shrubs,
widening the sidewalks and installing benches, the local merchants
began cleaning up the facades of their shops.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Graizbord dreams of rehabilitating the Alamar River, a
polluted waterway that cuts through the northeast of the city, into a
vibrant seven-mile greenbelt with gardens, recreation and housing.
And he hopes to make the poor colonias that have cropped up all over
the city into orderly villages with paved roads, running water and
community centers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot to expect in place where a third of the city lacks
basic services like sewage lines, where half the new homes go up
unapproved, where officials worry about running out of water in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   But Graizbord, a Harvard-educated urban planner who has worked for
the cities of Riverside and San Diego, said he now believes that
small initial achievements can be followed by greater ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not quixotic and naive," he insisted. "This is extremely
complicated and difficult, but it's possible."</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana officials and urban planners on both sides of the border
praise Graizbord for bringing badly needed optimism and vision to a
restive city.</TE>
<TE>   But high hopes alone cannot overcome unpredictable politics, a
sluggish bureaucracy and a sheer lack of money.</TE>
<TE>   The planning institute gets by on a $1-million annual budget, just
enough to pay the salaries of its 40 architects, engineers and urban
planners.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, Graizbord has to try to raise money from the
private sector to bring his plans to fruition, such as a statue
commemorating local teachers.</TE>
<TE>   He's also managed to launch the streetscape project along Avenida
Revolucion and add traffic improvements to a busy intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know when he will be able to realize his dreams for the
city," said Jose Luis Castro, director of the urban planning
department at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana. "I think
the attitude of Carlos is a good one. There has to be optimism about
bettering the city."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana began as an arid border outpost in 1889, but only truly
began to grow after World War II. The city's population has about
doubled every decade since then, fueled by migrants seeking work in
the United States or in the city's foreign-owned maquiladora
manufacturing plants.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana is now a city of more than 1.2 million--the exact figure
is difficult to ascertain because of the number of illegal
settlements and migrants passing through. With growth at twice the
national average, the city population is projected to reach 2.5
million by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, city officials are trying to figure out how to
manage that growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Planning is a concept that in Mexico and Tijuana has not been
very present," said Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the City Council established the Institute for
Municipal Planning as a quasi-independent agency, designed to free
planning from the wild swings of Mexican politics.</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord, 58, was chosen as its first director.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Guadalajara, he studied architecture at the National
University in Mexico City, and then urban and regional planning at
Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. He was doing long-range
planing for the city of San Diego when the job opened up in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "I do love difficult things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Every day he makes the commute from his manicured San Diego
neighborhood of Scripps Ranch to the sparse two-story offices of the
institute, located on a frenetic Tijuana avenue. (He said he has
remained in San Diego because his wife works there.)</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord's shirt pocket is always stuffed with half a dozen pens
and pencils, which he frequently yanks out to illustrate an idea for
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Carmen, says ruefully that he regularly springs out of
bed at 6 a.m. on the weekends and rushes to the computer to e-mail
his staff a new idea.</TE>
<TE>   But he loses sleep too--about last year's severe budget cuts and
the fear that a new city administration might not be as supportive of
long-range planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I'm in an optimistic mood," he told a visitor with a grin
on a recent afternoon, his thick glasses perched on his forehead.
"Next time you come by, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord's efforts so far have earned him kudos from city leaders
anxious to show investors and tourists a remade Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "He has worked very hard against the odds, breaking the
bureaucracy of the government to achieve these projects," said Jose
Galicot, owner of a telecommunications company and president of a new
organization working to improve the city's image. "There are many
people in Tijuana who talk and don't do a thing. Graizbord is a
thinker and a doer."</TE>
<TE>   But getting things done is not always easy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a recent spring afternoon, Graizbord navigated the jumble of
unmarked streets that make up Tijuana's downtown, pointing out the
peeling billboards, the heavy electrical wires sagging in front of
windows and the cacophony of signs that leap out from record shops,
bars, souvenir emporiums and cheap motels.</TE>
<TE>   "You see all that mess?" he said, exasperated. "Let's clean up the
signs, put the electrical wires underground and add trees. Just
beautifying it will have a big effect."</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord believes that simple steps like these will act as
"detonators," slowly altering the way people perceive the city and
their investment in it.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of Avenida Revolucion, he pointed with pride to the
rows of neat shrubs that line a few blocks of the street.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Graizbord hopes to extend the streetscape project down
the length of the downtown avenue to the international border and,
one day, to a pedestrian walkway that would link to a shopping mall
north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Avenida Revolucion dead-ends at the corrugated metal
fence.</TE>
<TE>   But Graizbord hopes that the modest beginnings on the avenue
eventually will lead to grander transformations.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to fight against the backlog," he said. "We
won't rehabilitate the entire city. But we can make it a better place
to live."</TE>
<TE>   If city officials have any complaints about Graizbord, it's that
they want him to get a long-range plan for the city done faster. They
are convinced that any hope of controlling the area's growth lies in
targeting new development.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two Tijuanas," said Manuel Guevara, the city's
secretary for urban growth. "The one already built, where our parents
and grandparents live, and the second Tijuana, the one that will be
built in the next 20 years. We need to build that one better."</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord said he understands those pressures, but he's worried
that some city leaders are unrealistic about the pace of change.</TE>
<TE>   "People can't expect quick results," he said. "This isn't a
tanning bed."</TE>
<TE>   Over on Tijuana's east side, Graizbord wants to launch a
$5-million pilot project to demonstrate how the city's impoverished
neighborhoods can be improved. About 5,000 people now live in
ramshackle houses that make up the hillside colonia called 10 de
Mayo. Graizbord's staff, with the help of planners from UC San Diego,
have outlined a project that includes paving the streets, installing
water and sewage lines and rehabilitating a dry and trash-laden creek
bed into a lush neighborhood park.</TE>
<TE>   The institute has approached the nearby maquiladoras, which employ
many of the residents, to invest in the project. So far, one company
has agreed to consider the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord hopes to connect the 10 de Mayo park to a larger
ecological preserve along the Alamar River, a tributary of the
Tijuana River that frequently floods during heavy rains.</TE>
<TE>   He envisions building riverfront parks and housing, and even a
botanical garden showcasing various flora from around Mexico--plans
that evoke American environmentalists' hopes for resurrecting the Los
Angeles River. The price tag for the Mexican project: around $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   The planning institute does "excellent work, really first-rate,"
said Keith Pezzoli, a professor of urban planning at UC San Diego,
who is working with Graizbord on the 10 de Mayo project.</TE>
<TE>   "But building plans is one thing. Implementing them is another.
Where is the money going to come from?"</TE>
<TE>   The lack of money is also evident in the shortage of
code-enforcement officers--100, or about a third the number needed to
rein in illegal construction.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of oversight was evident during a recent drive around the
city. Graizbord passed a truck depot next to the Alamar River, where
a dozen large vehicles idled, disgorging thick clouds of black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we're going to do with this," he said with a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, a tractor cleared mounds of dirt from the side
of a hill that appeared sliced in half--a site of new housing
development.</TE>
<TE>   "That's illegal," he said, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   Then Graizbord suddenly brightened.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the wonderful thing," he said. "There's always something
to do. If you worked in Paris, there would be nothing left to do."</TE>

<HD>Isolated Washington Enclave Near Breaking Point</HD>
<DH>Geography: Quirk created the 5-square-mile village, where
residents must traverse through Canada to get to the rest of the
state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID AMMONS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>POINT ROBERTS, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Deb Wilkowski says she's found paradise--and it can be a royal pain.</LD>
<LD>   Point Roberts is a five-square-mile American enclave that dangles
from British Columbia, surrounded on three sides by an inland arm of
the Pacific Ocean. A round trip to the rest of Washington state and
the Lower 48 involves four international border crossings--no small
matter after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack led to tighter border
security.</LD>
<LD>   It's a geopolitical quirk created by the 1846 treaty between the
United States and Great Britain establishing the 49th parallel as the
U.S.-Canadian border. Like a piece of dough left over after
cookie-making, Point Roberts became a disconnected chunk of U.S. soil
reachable only through Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Only the Northwest Angle in Minnesota, a peninsula jutting into
Lake of the Woods, is similarly isolated--the result of a surveyor's
error in the late 1700s.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like an island--without a ferry," with both the splendid
isolation and the problems that bespeaks, said Point Roberts'
Wilkowski.</TE>
<TE>   Point Roberts, so named by British explorer George Vancouver in
1792, is a bucolic village of beach cabins and mini-mansions, a
handful of shops, one tavern and one church, a schoolhouse, grocery,
marina, fire station, golf course, and Lighthouse Marine Park, which
doesn't have a lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   There are no fast-food franchises, no stoplights, no doctor's
office or veterinary clinic, no theater, no motels, no drugstore, no
City Hall--and virtually no crime. Point Roberts has all the security
of a gated community, and people leave their houses and cars
unlocked.</TE>
<TE>   Just a half-hour drive from cosmopolitan Vancouver, Point Roberts
is sleepy and serene. Locals revel in bingo at the fire station,
strawberry socials at Trinity Church, boating, fishing, coffee
klatches and golf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a piece of heaven," one woman told Gov. Gary Locke
during a recent visit.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 people--roughly half American and half Canadian--live
on Point Roberts year-round. The Point, as it's called, swells by
about 5,000 during the summer, adding to its seasonal getaway feel.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic population includes artists, filmmakers and airline
pilots who commute to Vancouver, retirees from both countries, and a
handful of people who scratch out a living working on The Point or
commuting to Blaine or Bellingham in mainland Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no middle class here," said Wilkowski, 36, who runs the
garbage utility with her husband. "It's like growing up in the Deep
South, with haves and have nots."</TE>
<TE>   It can also be tough to live here, say townspeople who have to
cross the U.S.-Canadian border twice just to get to the nearest
American town for medical care, schools and other services. The
nearest U.S. hospital is 70 minutes away in Bellingham.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers go through a checkpoint at Point Roberts--not much delay
here--and travel about half an hour through the bustling Vancouver
suburbs and the countryside to get to a border crossing at Blaine and
back into the United States. That can take an hour or more if trunks
are being searched.</TE>
<TE>   Eight million people cross the border at Blaine each year.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, both countries cracked down on border
security. President Bush recently signed legislation authorizing
1,600 new immigration officers along the 5,500-mile border by 2006.
That includes 100 new agents for Washington this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been living and dying by that border for years," said Ron
Nielson, a 40-year Point Roberts resident, who owns the building
supply store.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred townspeople showed up for the governor's town hall
meeting recently, both to sing Point Roberts' praises and to complain
about how cut off they feel from the rest of the county, state and
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Residents asked for help establishing a health clinic, a sewer
system so they can build resort facilities, and a more extensive
public education system.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought you were going to sell off The Point to balance the
budget," ribbed Scott Miller, 41, when Locke toured his children's
school.</TE>
<TE>   The unincorporated town's homey two-room school has 35 pupils in
kindergarten through third grade. After that, parents have to stick
their kids on a bus and send them to Blaine.</TE>
<TE>   Locke heard about how hard it is on the children to spend several
hours a day on a bus, sometimes departing in the dark of early
morning. Sports, music, drama, dances and other extracurricular
activities are a logistical nightmare, parents said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkowski said the town will continue to have trouble attracting
and keeping young families. As soon as a youngster makes it to the
fourth grade, the family has to decide whether to move away, resort
to busing, commit untold hours to home schooling, or pay for a
private school in Canada, she told Locke.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkowski said later that her family will send Izaac, 9, to
private school in British Columbia. "He'll learn French, but not U.S.
history."</TE>
<TE>   Locke offered to help with economic development, implementation of
a commuter lane at the Blaine crossing, and support for extra funding
for their school.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he gently pointed out, there are trade-offs to living in a
remote area.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkowski said her family has already made their peace with that.
"We'll live here forever," she said. "We're going to make it work."</TE>

<DH>ESTHER'S CHILDREN: A Portrait of Iranian Jews, Edited by
Houman Sarshar, The Center for Iranian Jewish Oral History/The Jewish
Publication Society: 458 pp., $110</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA B. NAHAI</AU>
<BD>Gina B. Nahai is the author of several novels,
including "Cry of the Peacock," a historical novel about the Jews of
Iran. Her piece also appears in the Jewish Journal.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his introduction to "Esther's Children," editor Houman Sarshar
speaks of a time when, 6 years old and about to start elementary
school, he discovered his legacy as an Iranian Jew. It was 1973. Over
breakfast in their apartment in Tehran, Houman's father, a top
planning commissioner in the shah's Iran, noticed the Star of David
pendant--a recent gift from a grandmother--hanging from his son's
neck. He reached over and slipped the necklace under Houman's shirt.</LD>
<LD>   "If anyone in school asks about your religion," he instructed his
son, "lie. Tell them you're Muslim."</LD>
<LD>   Houman's mother, a successful and highly regarded writer,
journalist and television personality, flew into a rage at her
husband's urgings. Surely, she asserted, no one in the shah's modern,
Westernized Iran cared about a child's religion. Surely, the Muslim
hatred for Jews, the years of discrimination against "impure
infidels," the pogroms and forced conversions that had, for
centuries, been the lot of her and her husband's people had died when
Iran became Americanized.</LD>
<TE>   "Jewish, Muslim--what does it matter nowadays?" she asked in her
typically confident tone.</TE>
<TE>   But it's her next sentence that leaves the deeper impression on
Houman.</TE>
<TE>   "Just tell them you're Iranian," she said. "Iranian like them."</TE>
<TE>   "Iranian like them" is not a notion with which the Jews of Iran
have often felt at ease. The oldest community in Diaspora, Jews have
lived in Iran longer than there has been an Iran or a Persia. Their
history dates from 597 BC when King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia
conquered Jerusalem and brought back 10,000 Jews as captives from
Jerusalem and Judea. Some 58 years later, the children of those
captives would rise against their Babylonian masters and help the
armies of Cyrus the Great into victory, thus ushering in the Persian
Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Having lived in freedom in Zoroastrian Persia, the Jews found
themselves under attack when Islam arrived in AD 637. Their
persecution began with a list of obligations, Shorut, written by Umar
II, that denied social and political equality to believers whose book
was not the Koran. Friendship between a Muslim and Jew, under this
law, was considered a mortal sin. Jews were declared impure and
untouchable--a belief that was strengthened by Shiite clergy about
700 years later--and barred from any physical interaction with
believers.</TE>
<TE>   Though the laws of impurity extended to nonbelievers of every
faith in Muslim Persia, they specifically targeted and victimized the
Jews. Muslim clergy, especially Shiite mullahs, have always claimed a
holy mandate to rule. Against the traditional, more secular
monarchies in Persia and later Iran, they needed an army of
zealots--the believers--to make a show of force. The quickest and
most certain way to rally the troops, the clergy learned, was to
designate a clear enemy--the Jew--and to declare jihad. In this, the
Muslim clergy were in time emboldened by news of the Inquisition in
Europe and by news of an anti-Semitic movement called Limpieza de
Sangre, "Purity of Blood," which had grown in Spain, targeting newly
converted Jews to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1,300 years the Jews of Iran were forced to live in
specific neighborhoods and to identify themselves by wearing special
patches on their clothes or, for women, wearing thicker veils over
their faces. Declared "not Iranian" and therefore barred from holding
military or government posts, they were forbidden to leave their
ghettos on rainy days (for fear that the rain might wash the impurity
off their bodies and onto Muslim soil), to touch any food or item
that may be consumed by a Muslim or to study any language except
Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Jews had no right to defend themselves in a court of law or to
offer testimony in another's defense. The life of a Jew was, by edict
from the clergy, worth the equivalent of the market value of a cow.
Worse yet, the entire Jewish community of a vast and varied nation
was punished for the crimes--real or imagined--of any individual
member.</TE>
<TE>   The history of Iranian Jews under Islam is therefore replete with
tales of pogroms and forced conversions. Their lot improved markedly
in the mid-20th century when the late shah's father, Reza Shah
Pahlavi, under American influence, curbed the power of the mullahs
and created a disciplined standing army that, for a while at least,
kept the "believers" in check. Until then, whether suspected of
drinking the blood of Muslim children, accused of plotting to destroy
Islam or convicted of insulting the prophet (famously when a group of
Jewish children walked, in 1922, ahead of a mule that had belonged to
a servant who worked for a mullah), the Jews remained under constant
pressure, always on the brink of annihilation. If the community
survived long enough to see the shah's reign, it was by preserving
their unique identity without ever challenging the treatment they
were subjected to. They learned to be vigilant, invisible, and
silent.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most devastating consequence of this--the Jews'
inability or reticence to challenge their lot--was a decision not to
record their history for fear of angering the mullahs. (The fatwa
against Salman Rushdie, while certainly the most well-known in the
West, was by no means the first or only one of its kind.) And so, a
people that had existed on a land for 3,000 years, that had produced
poets and philosophers, scholars and scientists and physicians,
failed, ironically, to document its own existence.</TE>
<TE>   The only exception to this was Habib Levy's "History of the Jews
in Iran," written in Farsi in 1956 and out of print until an abridged
version was translated into English and released in the United States
in 1999. Levy wrote his book in the Iran of Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi, at a time when the Jews were protected and were flourishing.
That was the Iran that Houman Sarshar grew up in, the Iran his
parents worked and thrived in. It was a nation torn between its
desire to return to a pre-Islamic, tolerant, progressive past and its
deep and visceral ties with Islam. From that country, some Jews found
the means to immigrate to Israel and the West. Others lived a
middle-class existence and feared a time when the shah would be
overpowered by the clergy. Still others, Sarshar's parents among
them, thrived not so much by denying their Jewishness, perhaps, as by
hoping it would go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   It was his parents' past--the awareness that while in Iran, they
had kept their identity half-veiled--that set Sarshar on the quest to
create "Esther's Children." The Islamic revolution of 1978 wreaked
unimaginable havoc upon the lives of Iranians everywhere, it is true,
but it also forced many into exile in lands where, away from the
reach of the mullahs, they discovered strengths they had forgotten
they had. So it was for the two-thirds of Iranian Jews who left the
country in the '80s and '90s. While some continued to live by the old
rules in Iran, a group of scholars in Los Angeles set about gathering
oral histories. The result is an impressive archive collected under
the aegis of the Iranian Jewish Oral History Project, the findings of
which have been recorded comprehensively in "Esther's Children." A
collection of 25 articles written by distinguished historians and
scholars living in the West, "Esther's Children" is exquisite in
presentation and meticulous in research. It manages a fine balance
between the aesthetic and the academic, between preserving the
Iranian and presenting the Jew in every facet of life. It is not
angry or pretentious, nor is it hesitant or apologetic. It is simply
a voice that stands confident and utters, without fear or compromise,
the simple truth of a people's existence.</TE>
<TE>   It brings to life--in 458 oversized pages and 500 photographs from
personal and public archives--the rundown overcrowded neighborhoods
where the Jews lived and died in poverty and disease; the synagogues,
some of which have sat empty since the mass emigration of Jews after
the revolution; and the schools, established in Iran in the 1920s by
the Alliance Israelite Universelle when the Jews were at last allowed
to learn to read and write Farsi, French and eventually English. It
presents a young girl dressed in a traditional gown for her wedding;
a group of Polish soldiers who, having escaped Hitler's armies in
Iran, were given safe haven in Jewish homes. It depicts the tomb of
Queen Esther, wife of Ahasuerus, who married the king by hiding from
him her Jewishness and later saved the Jews of Iran from Haman's
pogrom, commemorated in the holiday of Purim.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "Esther's Children" transcends ethnic or regional
significance and stands as testimony to the most urgent question
facing the West today: What happens to a people who are unable to
fight or who choose not to bear witness to evil, a people who do
not--or cannot--fight the armies of God, a people who blink in the
face of fundamentalism?</TE>
<TE>   Unmoved by his wife's assertions of her children's rightful legacy
as Iranians, Sarshar's father turns to his son that fateful morning
in Tehran and teaches him a lesson he believes will serve him well:</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody asks you your religion," he says, "you're allowed to
lie."</TE>
<TE>   The more things change for Jews all over the world, the more, it
seems, they stay the same. Yet for the Jews of Iran--at least under
the protection of the United States Constitution, in exile and away
from the mullahs--it is possible at last to speak the truth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Chinese soldiers crossed the Yalu River in November 1950, they
fought fiercely on the side of North Korea in the war against South
Korea and its U.S.-led allies. These days North Koreans cross the
river in the opposite direction, into China, to escape the repressive
Stalinists who have brought devastation and periodic famines on their
country. The refugees create a political problem for Beijing, but one
it can resolve even as it helps bring peace to the region.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year, more than three dozen North Koreans have sought
asylum in foreign embassies in China, hoping to reach other countries
that way. (Hundreds more have reached South Korea by other means.)
Despite the desperation of its citizens and an obvious need for
development aid, North Korea still displays a diplomatic
schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   Last month a dozen U.S. Congress members who had been led to
believe they would be admitted to North Korea arrived in Beijing,
only to find the Pyongyang government would not issue them visas. The
incident puts in doubt the Bush administration's statement several
weeks ago that North Korea was ready to resume talks over issues
including its nuclear weapons programs.</LD>
<TE>   It has been eight years since Washington brokered a deal to
provide Pyongyang with two light-water nuclear reactors in exchange
for shutting down two old reactors from which it was suspected of
extracting plutonium that could be used for nuclear weapons. North
Korea's fits and starts in following up on the agreement and its
refusal to let International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors view its
facilities raise doubts about its intentions.</TE>
<TE>   China could help itself, Washington and the two Koreas by leaning
on North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to stop stalling new negotiations.
China is North Korea's main window to the world; Beijing's airport is
the only one with regular flights to Pyongyang, and China provided a
venue for a North Korean computer show. Now China has been
embarrassed by pictures of North Koreans jumping over embassy walls
to seek asylum. It has balked at calling the fugitives political
refugees, which would entitle them to asylum and humiliate an ally.
However, it has let the defectors go to third countries en route to
South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Another victim of North Korea's obduracy has been South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his
lifelong crusade for democracy in the South and his "sunshine policy"
of reconciliation with North Korea. He visited the North two years
ago in what he hoped would be the start of reunions between families
trapped in separate halves of the Korean peninsula. But Kim Jong Il
has not reciprocated. The feeling in South Korea is that Kim Dae
Jung's liberal policy is a failure, and the South should quit trying.

<LD>Nothing focuses the attention quite so promptly as a sudden, serious
pain, especially a sudden, serious pain in the upper body. We're not
talking problems of the heart here; we're talking heart problems.
Unfortunately, heart conditions are endemic in our society. Every
year 300,000 new patients develop angina--severe chest pain caused by
constriction of blood vessels feeding the heart.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of those grand medical ironies of history that relief
from the awful squeezing pain of angina came to millions not from
white-coated doctors in pharmaceutical labs but from the rougher
commercial crowd that brought us dynamite, the indelicate explosive
that does the opposite of constrict things. You may recall dynamite's
inventor was a Swede named Alfred Nobel, whose stunning PR makeover,
from Dr. Death to philanthropic creator of the Nobel Peace Prize,
could inspire currently troubled public figures.</LD>
<LD>   Some 19th century doctors noticed that dynamite workers with
angina were free of symptoms until they returned home each night.
Imagine feeling better at work. But the relief was traced to
nitroglycerin, an element of dynamite floating in factory air.</LD>
<TE>   Nitro was refined into sprays, patches and a pill which, when
placed under the tongue, dissolves and in just three endless minutes
relaxes the tightened veins to erase the pain. This is great stuff.
In fact, nitroglycerin is so cheap and effective, it's regularly
among America's top 100 medicines.</TE>
<TE>   But during 130 years of ensuing marvelous medical progress, until
this last week no one knew exactly how nitroglycerin worked. Such a
medical mystery, actually, is not a unique phenomenon. No one
understands how aspirin, morphine and digitalis perform their medical
miracles. Who cares, you say. If you're benefiting from, say,
morphine, you're not really into dissecting how it works.</TE>
<TE>   But here's what Dr. Jonathan Stamler and his fellow Duke
University medical detectives finally figured out and wrote up for
the National Academy of Sciences: Mitochondria, key molecules within
every cell, act as catalytic enzymes. They convert the nitroglycerin
to nitric oxide, which relaxes the uptight blood vessels. This
discovery won't change the world as dynamite did. But if you ever do
need nitroglycerin, it's amazing how quickly those little
mitochondria earn gratitude so much larger than they are.</TE>

<LD>The story of the county budget is interesting only if one can see it
for what it is: not as a collection of multiple-digit numbers that
must add up, but as a political document that tells the priorities of
county politicians.</LD>
<LD>   The budget struggle between Sheriff Lee Baca and the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors is about more than money. This struggle
is a long-standing power play between the board members and the one
department head who gets more popular votes than any of them. More
important, this tug of war between Baca and the supervisors is an
attempt by the sheriff to assert that law enforcement must have
primacy in the budget, and that what constitutes law enforcement is
more than paying cops and locking cell doors.</LD>
<LD>   Baca's vision of his job is admirably more expansive than the
supervisors' narrow "it's not in my district" view of their
responsibilities. That said, Baca's beefing would be more persuasive
if he hadn't overspent his budget the last two years. He inherited
some debt, but he has more people on workers' compensation than any
other area of county government. He also stuck the county with a
$27-million court settlement that resulted from keeping inmates in
jail too long and illegally strip-searching them. That problem began
before his time, but it continued on his watch.</LD>
<TE>   The supervisors, who have final budget authority, say the sheriff
must make about $50million in cuts to his $1.6-billion budget. Baca
says their cuts would reach $100 million. The week before last, Baca
seemed to throw a temper tantrum by threatening to let 400 inmates,
accused of nonviolent misdemeanors, out of jail early. He's backed
away from that for the moment; he should remember that ultimatums
usually backfire.</TE>
<TE>   Baca must find reasonable savings and identify funds he can shift.
That doesn't mean he has to sacrifice his proposed downtown homeless
shelter, programs to help mentally ill inmates, prevention strategies
and other pieces of his expanded vision of law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff complains about an antiquated county accounting system
and correctly says he needs an independent audit to guide spending
decisions. Armed with specifics, Baca can better determine how much
is adequate to run a department with nearly 15,000 employees, operate
a jail system with nearly 20,000 inmates and protect the
unincorporated county and 41 cities that contract with the sheriff.
That's his core mission, but he shouldn't give up his fight for
literacy, anger management, parenting, drug recovery, prevention and
other programs that reduce recidivism but are dismissed by critics as
social work.</TE>
<TE>   Baca isn't the man you'd want doing your tax return. As a key
county manager, he has to learn to balance a budget. But he's also
pushing the county to consider a broader idea of what law enforcement
should be. That's a battle worth waging, and it's a point that
shouldn't be lost in the swirl of numbers.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Regulation Up to Speed</HD>
<DH>As the communications industry changes at a dizzying pace,
Michael Powell of the Federal Communications Commission is facing
criticism for his deliberate pace</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Shortly after his appointment last year as chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, Michael K. Powell surprised and delighted
a cable trade show audience by performing a somersault on his way to
the podium. The spontaneous stunt--a spoof of the acrobatic act that
had preceded him onstage--was classic Powell, symbolizing the energy
that industry leaders hoped the new FCC chief would bring to the
stodgy but powerful agency.</LD>
<LD>   At this year's trade show, Powell avoided the circus acts. But he
might as well have been walking a tightrope.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen months after Powell took the helm, his honeymoon is
over. The chairman is facing bubbling frustra- tion over the pace of
his agenda from some of the same industry leaders and conservative
politicians who en- thusiastically heralded his appoint- ment.</LD>
<TE>   Powell's progress in relaxing long-standing federal media
ownership rules is a particular sore spot. After being nominated to
the FCC by President Clinton in 1997, Powell quickly became an
outspoken advocate for scrapping or relaxing the controversial
regulations that prevent television broadcasters from growing larger
or merging with owners of newspapers or cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, was named FCC
chairman by President Bush in January 2001. In his early months as
chairman, Powell strongly hinted that media ownership rules would be
phased out in short order. But today, most of the rules remain in
place, with the exception of those that a federal court has thrown
out.</TE>
<TE>   "Powell's rhetoric has really outrun the reality of what he has
done," said Randolph May, a senior fellow specializing in
communications for the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, a conservative
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an impatient Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman
of the House Commerce Committee and a longtime Powell supporter,
nudged him to pick up the pace and wrap up a rule-making process to
repeal a ban on cross-ownership of TV stations and newspapers in the
same city.</TE>
<TE>   Some broadcasters are threatening to go to court to force the FCC
into action, something once unthinkable in a Powell administration.
Broadcasters argue that they need new powers to compete against
bigger rivals, such as cable companies, in local markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is anxious to know what the rules are so we can plan for
our business," said Tony Vinciquerra, president of the Fox Television
Network. Both Fox parent News Corp. and Viacom Inc., the owner of
CBS, have overstepped rules through recent acquisitions that prevent
one company from owning TV stations that reach more than 35% of the
country's viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times, has been one of the
staunchest critics of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule.
As have several other media companies, Tribune has pursued
acquisitions that risk violating FCC rules. Tribune owns The Times
and KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles and was granted a temporary waiver
of the rules in Orlando, Fla., where it owns a TV station as well as
the Orlando Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Powell said no final action on most of
the media rules was likely until early next year, as the commission
gathers the data it will need to defend any new rules in court. No
matter what the commission decides, legal challenges are likely.</TE>
<TE>   "My timetable is not dictated by the industry preferences," Powell
said, noting that media companies complaining about his progress are
those that stand to profit the most. "There are not children dying
because these rules have not been passed within the first year that
I've been chairman.... I don't want to do this exercise four times. I
want to do it right the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in his Washington office, Powell also expressed
frustration with those who have cast him as pro-business and a
knee-jerk deregulator.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's convenient to portray everything as an ideological
agenda," he said. "It really stinks to be a moderate. If you're a
moderate in your thinking, you really do have to wrestle....Yes, I
have philosophical biases. But I am very much committed to getting a
good, balanced regime out there."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's political future, however, will hinge on his FCC record,
which thus far has been thin on major accomplishments, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old attorney, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible
congressional candidate, says he is open to running for elected
office but is wary of the fund-raising demands and intrusions on
privacy that accompany campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Powell defends his FCC record. His greatest accomplishment? "I'm
still here," he said with a laugh. Much of his work has been done
behind the scenes, he said, to make the agency stronger and better
managed. Employee attrition at the 2,000-person agency dropped to 40
last year, compared with an annual average of 140, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters praise Powell for his recent efforts to advance the
roll-out of digital television, which has been stalled by
cross-industry squabbling. And even critics cite his integrity,
intellect and charisma.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also notes that his plate is full with a wide range of
issues, including freeing the communication spectrum, now held by
broadcasters, for use by wireless companies; and propelling the
media's transition to digital technologies, including the build out
of cable networks for high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough job," said former FCC Commissioner Harold W.
Furchtgott-Roth, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, a Washington think tank. "In a lot of areas he's headed in
the right direction--very slowly," Furchtgott-Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said media ownership rules remain on the front burner, but
he added that the issue is one of the most intractable and
misunderstood faced by the commission. Past commissions have not had
the courage, he said, to tackle the long-simmering dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Many television executives chalk up the delay to politics and in
particular to a power shift in the Senate in favor of the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, however, said the delay had been caused largely by a
string of rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia that have thrown virtually every TV ownership rule into
question. In three rulings during the last 15 months, the court has
suspended or questioned five key rules, including the 35% national
broadcast cap, the 30% national cable ownership cap and the ban on
cross-ownership of cable systems and broadcast stations in the same
market.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been absolutely imprudent to move hastily without
the completion of key court cases that were pending on these issues,"
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Courts traditionally have deferred to the FCC in formulating such
rules, but the recent string of rulings signaled a seismic shift by
the appeals court, which is demanding that the commission defend its
policies with solid evidence about the risks of media consolidation
and cross-ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The rules were crafted during the last five decades to encourage a
diversity of viewpoints and locally based programs on television and
to prevent large media companies from dominating the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   But media companies say the rules have outlived their usefulness.
As a commissioner, Powell agreed that new rival technologies, such as
cable, satellite and the Internet, have dramatically increased the
number of television channels and information outlets entering the
home.</TE>
<TE>   As long as competition exists, Powell and others advocate removing
government rules and letting the free market determine what voices
are heard on television.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules cannot be justified," said Barry Faber, general counsel
of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., a Baltimore-based station owner
that recently won a legal challenge of the FCC's so-called duopoly
rule. That rule bans companies from owning two television stations in
the same market unless there are at least eight other stations in
that market.</TE>
<TE>   Sinclair's suit originally was filed during the Clinton
administration, but Faber said he had noticed little change in policy
at the FCC under Powell. As a result, Sinclair has asked a federal
court to suspend the rule pending the FCC's review.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still concerned about how long the FCC will take to act,"
Faber said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell faces criticism from some key Democrats, such as Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, and from consumer groups that
contend that the consolidation of media has reduced the number of
independent voices on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Powell is driven by his intellectual beliefs, but he's short on
the soul-searching required by his office," said Jeff Chester,
executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a media
watchdog.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Hollings blasted Powell for attempting to
change the media ownership rules, saying Powell would be better
suited to lead the Chamber of Commerce than a regulatory agency.</TE>
<TE>   A comprehensive media ownership study is underway at the FCC.
Powell created a media ownership task force and has ordered several
studies to measure the effect of cross-ownership and consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes time," he said. "Every one of these rules is the cousin
of the other. While industry can separate them if it's in their
interest to do so, I can't."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics worry that Powell, a former antitrust lawyer at the
Justice Department, is overly cautious and should worry more about
the end game. He tends to avoid confrontation, analysts say, and
building consensus takes longer.</TE>
<TE>   Powell may be a victim of his past criticisms of media ownership
rules, which created high expectations for quick action.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, he's trapped by his own rhetoric," said former FCC
Chairman Richard E. Wiley.</TE>

<LD>The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing six key media
ownership rules:</LD>
<LD>   National Television Ownership</LD>
<LD>   * Rule: Prohibits any single company from owning TV stations that
reach more than 35% of the national audience.</LD>
<TE>   * Status: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled in February that the cap was "arbitrary and capricious." The
rule remains in effect, but the FCC must justify it.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership</TE>
<TE>   * Rule: Prohibits ownership of a broadcast TV station and a daily
newspaper in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   * Status: Among the media companies that have a waiver is Tribune
Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times and KTLA Channel 5. There are no
current legal challenges to the rule, but the FCC announced in
September that it would consider repealing the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Cable-Broadcast Cross-Ownership</TE>
<TE>   * Rule: Restricts joint ownership of a cable system and broadcast
station in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   * Status: Overturned by the D.C. appeals court in February.</TE>
<TE>   Local Television Duopoly</TE>
<TE>   * Rule: Prevents companies from owning two local stations in the
same market unless there are eight other local stations serving it.
Fox network parent News Corp. and CBS parent Viacom Inc. have
aggressively pursued duopoly station ownership. News Corp. owns two
TV stations in seven cities; Viacom owns two stations in six cities.</TE>
<TE>   * Status: In April, the D.C. appeals court ordered the FCC to
justify the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Horizontal Ownership</TE>
<TE>   * Rule: Prevents cable and other pay-TV operators from serving
more than 30% of the market.</TE>
<TE>   * Status: Reversed by the D.C. court in March 2001. The FCC opened
an inquiry in September to revise the cap, which has been mandated by
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Vertical Ownership</TE>
<TE>   * Rule: Prevents cable and other pay-TV operators from carrying
their own programming or programming produced by affiliated companies
on more than 40% of their systems.</TE>
<TE>   * Status: Reversed in March 2001 along with the horizontal cap.
Under FCC review.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although a broad variety of political issues and grievances in the
San Fernando Valley and Hollywood are pushing a split from Los
Angeles, business issues are driving the secession movements.</LD>
<LD>   And arguments and campaigns over business issues--taxes,</LD>
<LD>   fees, bureaucracy, unions, pensions--will make this a long, hot
summer and fall.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes are high. The consequences for business and Southern
California's economy if the San Fernando Valley were to break away
are unknown. But they are unlikely to be minor, since the Valley
boasts about 50% of all the manufacturing in Los Angeles County, 15%
of the county's work force, plus higher average and median incomes
than the rest of the region.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, if both the Valley and Hollywood secede, Los
Angeles' population would be reduced by 40%. The city's political
influence and that of its mayor's office would be diminished, of
course. That could reduce access to federal programs for the region.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, political diminution of Los Angeles would lead to
greater power and influence for the governor and Legislature and the
county supervisors, who, in addition to their other duties, function
as administrative agents of state government.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of such potential political shifts are yet to be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   Business issues are easier to grasp, although it should be said
that the business problems seem hardly serious enough to cause a city
to break up. To be sure, businesses and residents in the Valley have
grounds for complaint about neglect from Los Angeles City Hall. And
arguments about those complaints will decide the election in
November.</TE>
<TE>   But right now, the very threat of secession is spurring action to
solve some problems. Business and Los Angeles government are
collaborating to clean up a long-standing mess on taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Business taxes are a main bone of contention citywide. Los Angeles
imposes higher taxes on business than any other community in Southern
California. That fact is particularly grating to companies in the San
Fernando Valley because neighboring Burbank imposes some of the
lowest taxes and fees on business in the region, according to the
annual survey of business costs published by Kosmont Cos., a Los
Angeles consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some Valley businesspeople believe that taxes could be lowered
after secession, but that is unlikely. In fact, taxes in a Valley
city would almost surely be higher, at least initially, says
consultant Larry Kosmont. For legal reasons, a Valley city could not
impose a document transfer tax "and so will start out $31 million in
the hole," Kosmont points out, and might have to resort to other
taxes to make up the differences. (Doc transfer taxes, imposed
on sales of property, affect homeowners as well as business--a
demonstration of how closely business and general public issues are
linked in the secession dispute.)</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: Nothing will change on taxes or other
matters during a nine-month transition period if secession wins in
November.</TE>
<TE>   The form of Los Angeles business taxation also is an issue. The
city imposes a gross receipts tax, meaning that retail concerns such
as car dealers pay taxes on the sales price of vehicles they sell in
the city, not on the profit from the sale or on their dealership's
revenue after deducting staff and equipment costs. Similarly,
lawyers, accountants and other service providers pay taxes on their
billing totals, before deducting costs.</TE>
<TE>   Tax Problems Appear</TE>
<TE>   to Be Solvable</TE>
<TE>   But businesses that sell outside the city, such as car dealers in
Burbank or lawyers in Beverly Hills, pay lower taxes.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason Bert Boeckmann, owner of Galpin Motors in North
Hills, and David Fleming, a prominent attorney in Studio City, are
leading supporters of the Valley Vote movement.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even on taxes, details behind the issues offer a different
perspective. Valley businessmen Marvin Selter, a consultant and civic
leader, and Sanford Paris, a developer of industrial property, serve
on a business tax committee organized by the Los Angeles mayor's
office. The committee soon will propose alternatives to the gross
receipts tax.</TE>
<TE>   One alternative could be a per-employee tax similar to what
Beverly Hills, Burbank and other cities use, Selter says. Also,
reforms of state law, which take effect in January, could help Los
Angeles reduce its taxes on business, says Jonathan Kevles, head of
economic development in Mayor James Hahn's office.</TE>
<TE>   So the tax problem appears solvable short of municipal
divorce--although as one expert points out, the solutions have been
talked about for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond taxes, a major business gripe is about Los Angeles' city
bureaucracy, which delays permits and inspections and adds
tremendously to business costs. Complaints are not confined to the
Valley. Indeed, it is hard to overstate the anger and contempt that
many small to medium-sized businesses express at city government.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, the Latham &amp; Watkins lawyer who is a leader in the Valley
secession movement, says a new Valley city would have "better
services at lower costs" because it could start fresh, reducing
staffing of city offices and negotiating a more reasonable deal with
Los Angeles' municipal unions.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming focuses particularly on pensions, a city budget issue that
touches business and all taxpayers. Los Angeles' pension system
offers city workers retirement after 30 years of service at 70% of
highest pay plus health benefits for life. "No business can afford
that anymore, and the city can't either," Fleming says. He would
negotiate "a different pension deal for new hires," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleming and Valley secession face union opposition. Miguel
Contreras, head of the Southern California AFL-CIO, says he will work
to bring 220,000 union members to the polls to vote against
secession. "And only 15,000 of those are city workers," Contreras
adds.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession would be bad. We should solve our problems as one
house," Contreras says. Unions would undoubtedly represent municipal
employees in a new Valley city, but negotiating with two major city
halls instead of one could divide and weaken union power.</TE>
<TE>   The long campaign over secession is only beginning, and as yet
most businesspeople remain uncertain and skeptical on the issue. "I
don't hear a unified outcry from the business community," says Bruce
Ackerman, president of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando
Valley, a private economic development organization of more than 125
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Mosher, president of Precision Dynamics, a large Pacoima
firm that makes medical devices, is "totally" for secession. "The
Valley has been a patsy for that downtown crowd that takes our money
for every cockeyed scheme, like this NFL foot- ball.... " Mosher
says, referring derisively to a proposal for the city to offer
reclaimed land for a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   But other businesspeople take a wait-and-see attitude. Harvey
Berg, head of ACI Billing Services, a Northridge firm that makes
software that facilitates billing for long-distance
telecommunications, says he has a long-running lawsuit against the
city over how his business should be classified for tax purposes. Yet
the delivery of city services for his 90-employee company, which has
$40 million in annual sales, has been fair on the whole, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Businesses Worry About Incentives</TE>
<TE>   Doing business in a smaller city such as Burbank, Glendale or
Calabasas would be cheaper because they impose lower taxes and fees,
Berg notes. But whether that would be true for a new Valley city
remains to be seen, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Paris, owner of Encino-based Paris Industrial Parks,
says that though the city's bureaucracy can be a pain in the neck,
reform is clearly possible. Paris cites Andrew Adelman, who as head
of building and safety has made simple and productive changes, such
as assigning one inspector to a construction project instead of three
or four.</TE>
<TE>   Paris says a new city would give the Valley an "opportunity" to do
a better job, but there's no guarantee the opportunity would be ful-</TE>
<TE>   filled.</TE>
<TE>   Many businesspeople worry about the consequences for their
companies if the Valley decouples. Ricon Corp., for example, is a
manufacturer of wheelchair lifts that employs 450 workers in a
factory on the site of the old General Motors plant in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   Ricon got tax breaks and training grants from City Hall and
discounts from the Department of Water &amp; Power because it was the
first tenant to build on the GM site.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Valley becomes a new city, "will my company lose those
incentives?" asks Ricon Chief Executive William Baldwin. "I've been
unable to get a straight answer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," says Kevles of Hahn's office. "It's just
one part of the vast amount of uncertainty surrounding the secession
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Kevles fears that the whole region will suffer a downturn in
investment as companies and investors from around the country back
away from the bewildering local scene.</TE>
<TE>   However, economist Shirley Svorny of Cal State Northridge
dismisses such concerns, noting that the county is made up of 88
cities now. One or two more won't deter investors, she maintains.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the possibility of secession, not to mention possible years
of transition for cities to accommodate their new status, could very
well discourage investors locally and nationally.</TE>
<TE>   So the question arises why Los Angeles has to break up if the
reform of the offending tax system is already underway and
improvement in the city government's responsiveness to business and
local concerns is attainable. Reform rather than rupture would seem a
better way.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, the Valley's Economic Alliance has been
seriously studying other models of urban reform. London, for example,
has transferred authority for education, social services, housing,
some local transit and other services to its 32 local boroughs. The
main functions of the Greater London Authority now are economic
development, transportation and metropolitan police.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs Considered</TE>
<TE>   Fall-Back Position</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore is striving for decentralized regional administration
that retains the central core city.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles today many experts--from City Councilwoman Wendy
Gruel, who represents a Valley district, to state librarian and
historian Kevin Starr--are calling for the city to form boroughs for
local administration and control.</TE>
<TE>   And they could be on to a solution, although not for the present,
says Ackerman of the Valley's Economic Alliance. "Boroughs have zero
chance today, but they are the fall-back position if the secession
vote fails--or even if it passes," Ackerman says. Fleming says the
proposed Valley city would have boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Los Angeles, the city and county and its $350-billion
annual economic output, face a critical choice in the November
election. Many may hope that the city's residents and business owners
would try to solve problems together, but it remains to be seen
whether a majority of voters share such hopes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From several recent stories in The Times, we discover that Vivendi
Universal, the huge media and water management conglomerate from
France, has been hiding investment losses, among other things, in
off-balance-sheet accounts. Shades of Enron, Andersen and Global
Crossing, to name a few.</LD>
<LD>   What makes this particularly troubling is that this old French
water management company is one of the largest operators of municipal
water systems in the U.S. And once again, a huge corporation beholden
to shareholders more than consumers was contracted with the delivery
of a public utility and caught red-handed in another version of
corporate three-card Monte.</LD>
<LD>   Though California's biggest cities have not privatized their water
districts with Vivendi, this latest development makes one wonder what
could have happened if it had been otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   We were scammed by the electricity providers last year. Could we
have been held hostage by another greedy corporation, paying out
hundreds of millions in executive bonuses, over water "shortages"?</TE>

<TE>   Re: "Directors Determine CEO's Worth," June 2:</TE>
<TE>   The situation is even more egregious.</TE>
<TE>   Take the example of Bruce Karatz of KB Home. Karatz has been CEO
of the company since the time of its initial public offering in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   From January 1992 through December 2001, an investor in an S&amp;P
index fund would have seen a $10,000 investment grow to a value of
$33,710.</TE>
<TE>   A conservative investor in a 10-year money market account would
have seen the value of $10,000 grow to $19,672. The same investment
in KB Home would be worth $19,353, less than the insured money market
instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite this mediocre performance throughout the '90s, during
which time Karatz was consistently ranked among the top in executive
pay packages, the KB Home board of directors felt obliged to offer a
retention package or "signing bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Signing bonus for what? Why offer a 30-year veteran employee a
retention package when his performance has been mediocre at best?</TE>
<TE>   I thought the board's responsibility was to do all it could to
protect the interests of the shareholders and enhance shareholder
value.</TE>

<TE>   Restating Analyst's</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Ties</TE>
<TE>   I would like to address a number of the issues raised in
"Analyst's Global Crossing Ties Accentuate Concerns," June 1.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Jack Grubman did not have an "unusually cozy
relationship" with our company and was not involved in decision
making. Grubman was a leading Wall Street analyst at one of the firms
that advised Global Crossing on various transactions.</TE>
<TE>   He had no authority at Global Crossing, and in only one case, the
US West tender offer, did he advise the entire management team on the
selling of stock. In that tender offer, our founder and chairman,
Gary Winnick, and other members of management sold only half the
number of shares they were entitled to sell in the offer so that all
shareholders could benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman did not have a hand in the hiring of Robert Annunziata as
chief executive of Global Crossing. Jack Scanlon, a former Global
Crossing CEO, who now is CEO of Asia Global Crossing, actually
recommended Annunziata to the company.</TE>
<TE>   Your assertion that Grubman had a strong relationship with Winnick
is overstated and misleading. While Winnick did speak with Grubman a
number of times, it was not on a daily basis, and contrary to your
article, Winnick has had a longer and closer working relationship
with John Otto, a well-known and respected investment banker at
Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   We hope that this will set the record straight and correct any
further misperceptions created by your article.</TE>

<HD>Buying Stock of Companies in Bankruptcy Is a Loser's Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'd like your opinion on investing in companies that have
filed for bankruptcy, especially those in Chapter 11. I have tried to
follow some of these companies in the newspaper but have had trouble
finding information. Their stocks are especially cheap, but is it
realistic to expect a return at some later date?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: In a word: no.</LD>
<LD>   Buying the stock of companies in bankruptcy proceedings is a
loser's game. In fact, professional investors are continually amazed
at how many small investors seem to be willing to lose their shirts
this way.</LD>
<TE>   In the vast majority of corporate bankruptcies, shareholders are
left out in the cold. It's the creditors who wind up owning the
company, not the people who own its stock.</TE>
<TE>   Professional and institutional investors understand this, and they
are usually long gone by the time a company formally files for
Chapter 11 reorganization (which often turns into a Chapter 7
liquidation). Even when a company successfully reorganizes, its
liabilities are usually much larger than its assets, leaving nothing
for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Yet consistently after a bankruptcy filing, you'll see millions of
the company's shares change hands as small investors insist, against
all reason, that their stock will be worth something at day's end.</TE>
<TE>   This happens even when companies signal to investors, or tell them
outright, that their shares are worthless. Such was the case with
EToys, the failed Internet retailer that all but sent telegrams to
investors telling them their shares were toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for weeks afterward, posters on Internet message boards
insisted that they would get something for their shares, because the
EToys name had some value. They were right in one sense: EToys sold
its name and other assets to KB Toys Inc., but the proceeds went to
EToys' creditors and investors didn't see a dime.</TE>
<TE>   On Medicaid, Yes,</TE>
<TE>   California Is Different</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently answered a question from a woman who was taking
care of her elderly mother and who worried that the family home might
be lost if the mom went on Medicaid. Your answers were correct if you
were talking about federal Medicaid rules, but some states are more
generous.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, Medicaid is called Medi-Cal, and the
period during which an asset transfer may be penalized is only 30
months, rather than the federal program's 36 months. Also, in
California a home may be transferred to anyone, not just a
care-giving child, without a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   A: You're quite right: Some states diverge from the federal
Medicaid rules, which is why I suggested that the original writer
check with an attorney who specialized in elder-law issues before she
took any action. The National Assn. of Elder Law Attorneys at
www.naela.com can offer referrals.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a Tip: Don't</TE>
<TE>   Be Such a Cheapskate</TE>
<TE>   Q: With so much talk about Social Security going broke, we need to
make sure that contributions are made by all employees and employers.</TE>
<TE>   So why are tips allowed to go unreported? I'd guess 90% of tip
income is never declared, and the recipients avoid the 7.65% Social
Security tax as well as income taxes. By banning tips, businesses
would be forced to pay their workers a living wage and report that
wage to the appropriate tax agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start educating consumers about this unfair practice, which
we tolerate because of social pressure. I hear waiters say, "I've
been stiffed" so frequently that I'd like to give these freeloaders a
piece of my taxpaying mind.</TE>
<TE>   A: So says the man who obviously never toted a tray in his life.
Listen, buddy, if you don't want to tip your server, don't eat out,
or stick to fast-food restaurants. Tipping is customary and expected
in this country, and those who stiff waiters--no matter what their
rationale--are just plain cheap.</TE>
<TE>   The Internal Revenue Service has cracked down on restaurants that
allow their employees to hide tip income. Of course, it's always
possible to hide some cash, but the percentage of unreported tips is
hardly 90%.</TE>
<TE>   It might be nice if the U.S. adopted the European custom, in which
the service charge is included in the meal. But we haven't, and
you're not going to win anyone to your cause by continuing to stiff
servers who depend on tip income to support themselves and their
families.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to increase the chances your tip will be reported,
forgo cash and put your meal, and your tip, on a credit card. At
least that way you're leaving a paper trail the IRS can follow.</TE>
<TE>   Where's That Tax</TE>
<TE>   Refund? Look Here</TE>
<TE>   Q: Approximately two months ago I filed my federal income tax
return with the expectation of obtaining a $2,850 refund, but so far
I haven't received a check. Is there a telephone number I can call to
check on its status?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sure. Just call the main IRS hotline at (800) 829-1040. The
recorded prompts will guide you through the process. If you filed
using a 1040, 1040A or 1040-EZ form, you also can check the status of
your refund on the IRS' Web site at www.irs.gov.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS changed a lot of its mailing addresses this year, but many
people sent their returns to the old addresses, leading to delays.
Which, once again, is an argument in favor of electronic filing,
because you receive IRS confirmation within 48 hours that your return
has landed in the right place and been accepted.</TE>

<HD>Nissan Accelerates Assault on U.S. Market</HD>
<DH>Autos: Japan's No. 3 car maker appears to have turned a
corner as it readies new models and improves efficiency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SMYRNA, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Steve Fisher runs his fingers along the paint jobs of the Altima
sedans and Xterra sport utility vehicles that hum past him on the
assembly line at the Nissan Motor Co. factory here. He spends an
average of 66 seconds on each vehicle as it passes by--up to 465
times a day--checking switches, panel fits and connections under the
hood.</LD>
<LD>   Occasionally a screw doesn't line up, a hose fastener is broken or
there's a chip in the paint. But Fisher, who has worked here for 11
years, rarely finds defects--perhaps no surprise, because this plant
has been ranked the most efficient car factory in the U.S. seven
years in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Exhaustive quality exercises, scores of robots and the industry's
first fully automated paint shop are part of the arsenal behind the
No. 3 Japanese auto maker's forthcoming assault on the U.S. market.</LD>
<TE>   Nissan already has announced more upcoming new models than any
other auto maker except global leader General Motors Corp.: the
much-anticipated Z sports car; the Murano "crossover," a blend of car
and sport utility vehicle; the Quest minivan replacement; a full-size
pickup truck; and a full-size SUV.</TE>
<TE>   On the luxury Infiniti side, Nissan has the G35 coupe and M45
sedan, the FX45 crossover and an upscale version of the full-size
SUV.</TE>
<TE>   That's nine new vehicles that will hit the U.S. market between now
and mid-2004.</TE>
<TE>   With its recent new models, the company has been "hitting home
runs, with the products very well received," said Jeff Schuster, an
auto industry analyst with J.D. Power &amp; Associates in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts praise Nissan for its efficiency at Smyrna and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear platform sharing, 'lean' manufacturing and flexible
tooling such as Nissan is doing ... it ensures things like quality,"
said Catherine Madden, an auto manufacturing specialist with
forecaster DRI-WEFA.</TE>
<TE>   But the news on the quality front is not all rosy for Nissan. In
J.D. Power's annual Initial Quality Satisfaction survey--a ranking of
problems reported during the first 90 days of ownership--released
last month, Nissan fell from No. 3 to a tie for No. 6 as domestic
auto makers gained ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always focused on the long-term quality, durability and
reliability," Bill Kirrane, general manager for the company's Nissan
division, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of complaints such as wind noise, which are more
design-related than things that might take the car out of service,"
he said, referring to the J.D. Power findings. "But we'll look at
things we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts agree that productivity and success in the market
are separate issues and that the buying public pays little attention
to benchmarks such as factory efficiency. Nonetheless, after years of
financial decline and not getting its products right, Nissan is back
in the U.S. market with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "They've brought excitement back to their product lineup, which
has jump-started everything else," Schuster of J.D. Power said. "They
haven't had a miss yet in the new products they've launched under the
revival plan."</TE>
<TE>   Three-Year Plan Is</TE>
<TE>   Realized in Two Years</TE>
<TE>   To fuel this product assault on America, Nissan is adding
higher-margin Maxima sedan production to Tennessee and tripling
production at its engine plant about an hour from Smyrna. The company
also will assemble the new minivan, large pickup and SUVs at the
sprawling factory it is building in Mississippi, drawing largely on
lessons learned here about quality and productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "The layout of Nissan's plant areas allows a person to do the most
work in the least space," said Ron Harbour, president of Harbour
Associates, a Detroit-area research firm that publishes a closely
watched report on auto factory efficiency. "They minimize excessive
walking, put tools close to workers. The safety is right, the
ergonomics are there, the parts are easy to put on, they minimize
fasteners. The byproduct is pretty high quality and pretty high
productivity."</TE>
<TE>   That's good news for a company that was teetering on bankruptcy
just a few years ago. Before French auto maker Renault bought a
controlling stake in Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer lost money in
seven of eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan President Carlos Ghosn, sent to Japan by Renault to turn
around the company, devised a revival plan calling for heavy cost
reductions, plant closures, an overhaul of product design and the
product lineup and additional manufacturing efficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan realized the main goals of the three-year plan in just two
years: to get back in the black in the first year, reach 4.5%
operating profit margin and halve the $13 billion in automotive debt.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, less than three years after Ghosn took over, Nissan
reported a record net profit in fiscal 2001, ended March 31, of $2.96
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Nissan's ups and downs, the Smyrna plant, just outside
Nashville, has been remarkably consistent in turning out cars and
trucks more efficiently than any other factory in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Harbour report ranked Nissan in 2000 as the most efficient
manufacturer for the seventh year in a row, reducing assembly hours
per vehicle by 7.1% to 17.37. Its Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. ranked second and third, followed by the
joint-venture plant that Toyota and GM operate in Fremont, Calif.,
and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   If the Detroit-area Big Three of GM, Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group were as efficient as the Smyrna
plant, they could shed 95,138 workers, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Having achieved his goals a year early, Ghosn is pushing the
"Nissan 180" plan: to sell an additional 1 million or more cars and
trucks each year worldwide, reach 8% operating profit margin and
bring automotive debt to zero.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan's U.S. plants are a big part of the strategy. The Smyrna
factory produced Frontier pickups at a rate of 120,000 a year when it
opened in 1983; last year it rolled out 400,000 Altimas, Frontiers
and Xterras. With the Maxima coming in January, Smyrna production
will increase again, to 500,000 vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The new Canton, Miss., factory will add 250,000 trucks. Production
at Nissan's engine plant in Decherd, Tenn., will be tripled to
750,000, and the factory will become the sole engine supplier to the
company's two U.S. assembly plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Altima is a key to Nissan's growth. It used to be an
underpowered and undersized mid-size sedan, available with only a
four-cylinder engine. But the Smyrna-built model launched earlier
this year has a sleek, high-tech look, comes with an optional
six-cylinder engine rated at 240 horsepower and boasts a rear-seat
area with more legroom than any other model in its class.</TE>
<TE>   The Smyrna plant can be easily adapted to produce more vehicles
that are in demand, a point that is crucial as Nissan aims the Altima
at the segment leaders: Honda's Accord and Toyota's Camry.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Smyrna apart, industry experts say, is the level of
automation in assembly and painting and the continuous quest to make
things better and quicker.</TE>
<TE>   In the fully automated paint shop, some robots open and close
doors while others, resembling elephant trunks, snake over the
bodies, spraying primer and topcoat.</TE>
<TE>   Paint areas are extremely sensitive to contamination; the
slightest condensation, or even vapor from workers' deodorant, can
cause cratering. But automation and continual improvements have
resulted in a consistent 98% defect-free first run in Altima
painting, the company says.</TE>
<TE>   Plant workers designed and built their own "line-side limos," or
platforms that move alongside cars on the assembly lines at certain
locations, carrying tools and workers at adjustable heights to make
access to the vehicles easier.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan also follows its own version of "just-in-time"
manufacturing, a hallmark of Toyota's lean production system. Three
years ago, the Smyrna plant kept a five-day inventory of Xterra
parts, but "now it's about 2.5 days, and for the Altima, we've gotten
it down to 1.6 days," said Randy Knight, the plant's stamping
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Efficiency Adds to</TE>
<TE>   the Bottom Line</TE>
<TE>   John Reagan, department manager for Xterra body assembly, gives
another example of how the plant's performance is improving.</TE>
<TE>   The Xterra originally was scheduled to be produced at a rate of 17
an hour. But because of the SUV's popularity, workers made further
productivity gains, such as adding conveyor belts and robots, and
boosted the rate to 25 units an hour, increasing Xterra production by
about 33,000 a year, Reagan said.</TE>
<TE>   Workers even maintain a "Supplier Wall of Shame" on which problems
with incoming parts are detailed. In one case, for instance, they
determined that a worker at a supplier had used peanut oil to help
insert a piece into a receptacle. It "caused a chemical reaction that
made the support feet fall off," said a note on the wall. The problem
was brought up with the supplier and corrected.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing the number of defects and the time workers spend on
assembly may not have a direct effect on market share, but it adds
slowly and surely to Nissan's bottom line, said Michael Flynn,
director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at
the University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't buy cars because of the efficiency of a
factory--people buy them because of the product," Flynn said. "But
efficiency is a very important competitive element. In good times,
you make more money; in bad times, you lose less."</TE>

<HD>Locking In a Low Student Loan Rate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Interest rates on student loans will fall to an all-time low next
month, presenting indebted college graduates with an opportunity to
lock in a low rate for the life of their loans.</LD>
<LD>   The change will save the average student borrower
hundreds--possibly even thousands--of dollars, experts said. Those
who are heavily indebted, such as Brooke Gurland-Garrow of Brooklyn,
N.Y., who ran up $100,000 in student loans while working her way
through medical school, will save considerably more.</LD>
<LD>   "The interest rates when I was in medical school [in the late
1990s] were 8% to 10%," Gurland-Garrow said. "I remember thinking
that this was killing me. But what are you going to do? I had to
borrow. I'm really fortunate rates have dropped so much."</LD>
<TE>   Cuts Are Extra Help</TE>
<TE>   for Recent Graduates</TE>
<TE>   When student loan interest rates are adjusted July 1--as they are
every year--they'll fall nearly 2 percentage points to the lowest
levels in history. Depending on the type of loan and when it was
made, rates will range from 3.46% to 4.86%.</TE>
<TE>   The rate cut couldn't come at a better time for college graduates,
who are facing a tight job market at the same time that average loan
balances have soared, said Ellynne Bannon, director of the CalPIRG
higher education project. About 64% of all students borrow to finance
college today, Bannon said, and their average loan balance has nearly
doubled to $16,928 over the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that student loan rates are headed for all-time lows--and
probably won't fall much further--presents borrowers with a
potentially lucrative decision. Although student loan rates are
variable and can rise or fall each year, borrowers can lock in a
fixed rate by consolidating their loans, Bannon said.</TE>
<TE>   There are no fees involved, but the interest rate on a
consolidation loan can be one-eighth of a percentage point higher
than on a variable-rate loan. Also, unlike mortgages, which can be
refinanced as many times as a homeowner wants, student loans can be
consolidated just once. So if interest rates drop after a borrower
consolidates, he or she misses out on the lower rate.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, most borrowers would be wise to wait until next
spring before deciding whether to consolidate their student loans to
lock in this year's rate. Here's why:</TE>
<TE>   The annual adjustment of student loan rates is based on the
three-month Treasury bill rate set at the Treasury's final auction
each May. If interest rates fall over the next 12 months, borrowers
will be able to tell by the results of the May 2003 auction whether
the student loan rate will be adjusted higher or lower the following
July 1.</TE>
<TE>   If the rate is expected to rise, borrowers still would have time
to consolidate their loans, locking in this year's low rate. If it's
poised to drop, they can wait for their variable-rate loans to be
adjusted lower.</TE>
<TE>   There's one exception. Recent graduates whose loans still are in
the deferment period--the six months after graduation when payments
on student loans are deferred--may want to consolidate right after
the July adjustment. The reason: If you consolidate while in
deferment, your rate is 0.6 percentage point lower than it would be
after the grace period. That would make the rate on a recently
secured Stafford loan--the most common type of student loan--just
3.46%, said Maureen McCarthy Mellow, an education funding expert with
Academic Management Services in Swansea, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidating Typically</TE>
<TE>   Ends Grace Period</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, consolidating generally ends the deferment
period (unless the borrower consolidates through the government's
direct-loan program), so the borrower usually needs to start paying
back the loan right away. That said, for someone who has a job, the
rate break can make the accelerated repayment worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, all that's required to qualify for a consolidation loan
is that the student (or parent, if that's who is repaying the loan)
has student loan debt that is not in default. Some lenders also
require that you have a minimum amount of debt, such as $7,500 or
$10,000.</TE>
<TE>   To consolidate, the borrower must first go to his or her lenders
to inquire about consolidation. If there are several lenders, the
borrower can choose whichever lender offers the most advantageous
terms or best service. (Terms don't vary dramatically from lender to
lender. But some offer more repayment options than others. Some give
interest rate breaks to graduates who are willing to repay with
automatic debit plans, or offer attractive services such as
calculators on their Web sites and toll-free phone counseling.)</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers are generally offered four repayment plans on a
consolidated loan:</TE>
<TE>   * Standard repayment, which requires the balance be paid in full
within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Extended repayment, which stretches fixed payments over 12 to 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   * Graduated repayment, similar to extended repayment, except the
payment amount gradually increases.</TE>
<TE>   * Income-contingent repayment, which bases monthly payments on
what the borrower can afford.</TE>
<TE>   Stretching the payments beyond the standard 10 years means a
borrower will pay more in total interest, cautioned Mo Barakat,
senior financial advisor with American Express in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But if that allows a borrower to contribute more to a 401(k) plan
or to save for a near-term goal such as buying a house, that's a
reasonable trade-off, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who have a cash-flow crunch, [stretching out payments
with a] consolidation makes sense because then they can get on with
the other goals in their life, like saving for a home or a wedding,"
he said. "To expect young people to postpone other goals for a decade
or more while they pay off their student loans is just too much."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, student loans have no prepayment penalties, so it can
make sense to stretch out the repayment over the longest period
possible and pay off the balance early, if possible.</TE>
<TE>   Most lenders have loan counselors who can walk graduates through
the consolidation process, McCarthy Mellow said.</TE>

<HD>In His Own Words: Michael Powell's Changing FCC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since becoming chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in
January 2001, Michael K. Powell has vowed to overhaul the agency.
Powell, the son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, faces the
daunting task of crafting a series of rule changes about media
ownership. Last week he sat for an interview in Washington with Times
staff writers Edmund Sanders and Sallie Hofmeister.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Do you see yourself campaigning for public office one
day?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I'm not doing this so that I can run. I can see conditions
in which I could be induced to, but I do not have it listed as an
ambition of mine. I love government. The tough thing is there gets to
be a point where there aren't many of those types of jobs left, and
you've got to run for something. [But] there are a lot of unappealing
aspects: seeking money all the time; subjecting yourself and your
family to the trials and tribulations of it all.</LD>
<TE>   Q: What are the differences between serving as an FCC commissioner
and being chairman?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's a much more intense leadership responsibility. I have to
develop a federal budget. I have to hire and fire everybody. Keeping
morale high here, keeping them trained, so some phone company doesn't
pull your best people away is tough.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the FCC's top priorities?</TE>
<TE>   A: Broadband is No. 1. That means everything, not just DSL and
cable modems. The second is the continuing difficulties of
[competition]. People have lost sight of the fact that a few years
ago, there was no suggestion of competition in this space at all. We
[have] had a monopolized communications system not because somebody
took over the world, but because it's been government policy since
1917 to have one.</TE>
<TE>   The third one is spectrum. [This] is becoming extraordinarily
important real estate. Technology has finally solved some of the
thorny problems with using spectrum, so there are ever more
interesting applications and technologies that people want. How do we
redo the system in a way that spectrum can move more fluidly into its
higher and better uses?</TE>
<TE>   Fourth is this fascinatingly intractable [issue] of [developing] a
media ownership regulatory model.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some media executives and legislators are calling for the FCC
to deal with everything from payola in the radio industry to setting
a new decency standard. Is this your role?</TE>
<TE>   A: We try to be a little more focused on things that are going to
have consumer impact, as opposed to industry-to-industry stuff. We
often get people who try very aggressively to bring us in on
industry-to-industry disputes. You have to really focus and ask, "Is
this really a dispute about public policy?" or "Is this Disney wants
this, and these guys want that?"--where it's all about who's got the
leverage.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you talk about the criticism that the FCC is moving too
slowly to create new media ownership rules?</TE>
<TE>   A: The [appeals] court has said don't come back without a better
ability to empirically defend the choices you make. How do you do
that? You have to go out in the market and get that information. I've
been very careful about not letting industry players tell public
policymakers what the time frame is. If I was purely ideological
about this, I could just start knocking them [the rules] all out of
here. Or worse, do nothing and let them run into the court. But that
would bother me. If I'm going to get rid of a rule, I'm going to take
responsibility for making that judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Sen. Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee that oversees the FCC, says you are moving too fast toward
deregulation. What's your reaction?</TE>
<TE>   A: Are there places where we don't agree? Yes. It's more
remarkable that there aren't more conflicts like this. I come from a
family that teaches if you're not getting people upset, you're not
moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's your response to critics who say you are a conservative
ideologue?</TE>
<TE>   A: I pride myself on being judicious, meaning I'm open-minded and
I struggle with problems in a hard, rigorous way. If you were an
ideological liberal or an ideological conservative, things would fall
into boxes a lot cleaner and you wouldn't care about whether these
people didn't like it or these people did.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why have you pushed so hard on high-definition TV when there is
no public outcry for it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Long before I got here, the government went down this road on
digital TV. My job and responsibility is to try to make it go, and
make it go as quickly and efficiently as it can. We can sit around
and say nobody cares, but that's not a solution. The broadcasting
community has a lot of competitive challenges. If it doesn't harness
its digital future, it will find itself in enormous trouble. And that
will be a consumer public policy problem. If broadcasting remains
important to consumers, it's because 33% of people still need it, or
because when there's a tornado, that's where you're going to get
news. Its survival cannot be guaranteed by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Should broadcasters be able to use digital spectrum for
purposes other than HDTV to help pay for the transition to digital?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm not opposed as a policy matter, but there are legal
constraints about how much they can do. I'm a fan of making as much
creative flexible use of [the spectrum] as you can to respond to the
kind of competitive pressures that are going to exist. But it will be
extremely disappointing and infuriating if all that means is "Brady
Bunch" reruns. I don't think members of Congress and others who gave
out $70 billion in spectrum were doing it for that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the past you have been a critic of the public interest
standard. Since it is the yardstick used by the FCC to approve
mergers and set policy, what role does it play today?</TE>
<TE>   A: If I came to you and said AOL and Time Warner want to merge,
now make sure it's in the public interest, what would you do? One of
the things we're doing right now is developing competitive merger
guidelines that we will make public, so the industries will see the
kinds of things we're going to look at and evaluate in reaching that
decision. We need to do this because when it's open-ended, so is the
lobbying and the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A lot of free over-the-air TV, including sporting events and
other marquee programming, has moved to cable. Do you care?</TE>
<TE>   A:  The question we have to be cold and sober and willing to ask
is: "Do consumers care?" About 84% of Americans now subscribe to
cable and satellite [TV], and every year it seems to be 2% to 3%
more. What are we going to do when it's 95%? At some point, you do
have to begin to focus your policy interest on where your citizens
are. NBC is almost as much a cable company as it is a developer of
content for broadcast. My children don't know any difference between
Channel 4 and Channel 64.</TE>

<LD>Ex-CEO of Tyco Charged</LD>
<LD>   With Evading Taxes</LD>
<LD>   L. Dennis Kozlowski, the mega-rich deal maker who built Tyco
International Ltd. into a huge conglomerate, was charged with evading
more than $1 million in sales taxes owed on purchases of artwork.</LD>
<TE>   In a 12-count indictment in New York State Supreme Court,
prosecutors alleged that Kozlowski engaged in an elaborate scheme
with several art dealers to avoid paying New York state and city
sales taxes on at least six paintings worth $13.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, 55, resigned as chief executive of Tyco the day before
the charges were announced. As CEO, he was awarded a pay package last
year worth about $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded not guilty to charges of sales tax violations,
falsifying business records, tampering with physical evidence and
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Says His Firm</TE>
<TE>   Acted Within the Law</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer subpoenaed Perot Systems Corp.
for more information about the company's role in marketing techniques
to exploit weaknesses in the state's electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Company Chairman H. Ross Perot, in an interview with The Times,
said his firm's activities were legal and sanctioned by state power
grid officials.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems helped develop the computer systems for the
California Power Exchange and the California Independent System
Operator.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) released a 44-page computerized
sales presentation produced by Perot Systems' energy services unit
that touted ways to boost profit in California's electricity markets
by taking advantage of holes in market rules or protocols.</TE>
<TE>   The document unleashed a political uproar, and Gov. Gray Davis
called on federal regulators to investigate the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Perot said current and former executives would cooperate in the
investigation. The two-time presidential candidate said his company
developed the energy marketing techniques based on publicly available
information about California's deregulated energy market.</TE>
<TE>   Jobless Rate Down;</TE>
<TE>   Gradual Recovery Seen</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.8% in May and employers
added 41,000 jobs, the Labor Department said, but almost no one was
taking the new numbers as evidence that the economy is recovering
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Government analysts accompanied the monthly figures with a
sweeping revision of past reports that indicates that the department
missed about one in every five jobs lost since the start of the
recession in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the new hiring in May was by temporary employment
agencies--hardly a vote of confidence that the country is coming back
on all cylinders.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that we're in the early stages of a tepid
recovery," said Los Angeles economic consultant Donald H. Straszheim.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's Fate Rests</TE>
<TE>   With Jury in Houston</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began their deliberations in the federal
obstruction-of-justice trial of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in
Houston after prosecutors and defense attorneys battled about the
firm's intent when it shredded documents last year related to Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   To convict the company, the jury must find that an Andersen
employee "corruptly persuaded" another to destroy evidence with the
intent to conceal it from regulators. If convicted, the 89-year-old
accounting giant would lose its right to audit public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Two Courts Deal Fresh</TE>
<TE>   Setbacks to Big Tobacco</TE>
<TE>   A West Coast appeals court upheld a verdict against Philip Morris
Cos. and restored an $80.3-million damage award that the trial judge
had trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate decision, a San Diego judge fined R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. $20 million after finding that the country's No. 2
cigarette maker was targeting teenagers by advertising Camel and
other brands in magazines such as InStyle, Spin and Hot Rod.</TE>
<TE>   The fine is believed to be the first financial penalty imposed for
a violation of the 1998 settlement that freed the nation's tobacco
companies from lawsuits filed by the attorneys general of 46 states.</TE>
<TE>   RJR's top lawyer said the company would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris also said it would appeal the Oregon Court of
Appeals finding that the trial judge had erred in paring the verdict
to $32 million in a suit filed by survivors of Jesse D. Williams, a
Portland school custodian and longtime Marlboro smoker who died of
lung cancer in 1997 at age 67.</TE>
<TE>   New York Arrests Have</TE>
<TE>   Links to Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   The former producing partner of actor Steven Seagal was accused of
taking part in a Gambino crime family plot to extort money from a
Hollywood film figure, later identified as the action star.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Julius "Jules" R. Nasso came in a sweeping
indictment whose broader purpose is to crush organized crime's hold
on local waterfronts, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Named with Nasso in the 68-count federal indictment charging
racketeering, fraud and extortion was the crime family's acting boss,
Peter Gotti, brother of imprisoned "Dapper Don" John Gotti, now
serving a life prison term in Joliet, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, 49, of Staten Island, N.Y., was arrested and charged with
two counts of conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion
of a figure in the motion picture industry.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson Joins Coalition</TE>
<TE>   for Music Artists' Rights</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson became the latest pop star to jump on the artist
rights band wagon, accusing his record company, Sony Music, of
questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson recruited the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York-based
activist, and lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. to launch an initiative
to "emancipate" him and other recording artists from unfair
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The pair's sudden involvement in a growing artist rights movement
that began in California 18 months ago could bring additional trouble
for the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of the Sony Corp. unit declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   USC to Close High-Tech</TE>
<TE>   Business Incubator</TE>
<TE>   USC officials have decided to shut the school's technology
business incubator, known as EC2, on June 30. The project helped more
than two dozen technology firms get their starts.</TE>
<TE>   Officials cited several reasons cited for closing the incubator,
including falling investment yields that reduced available funding
and the dot-com collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in the fall of 1995, it was one of the first high-tech
business incubators in Los Angeles. It was funded by the USC
Annenberg Center for Communication.</TE>
<TE>   Trader Agrees to Face</TE>
<TE>   Charges in New York</TE>
<TE>   Amr I. "Anthony" Elgindy, the Encinitas, Calif., speculator
accused of using FBI secrets to manipulate stock prices, agreed to be
taken to New York, where he and four others face charges of
racketeering, fraud, extortion and obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, 34, waived his right to an extradition hearing. He was
being held without bail in San Diego, and it was unclear when
marshals would take him to New York. Three alleged accomplices have
surrendered in New York or promised to appear there.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Leaders Skirt the Issue of Complicity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger Mahony's spin doctors have helped him write a good
full-page advertisement addressing the problem and the solution the
Catholic Church is now facing (Page A23, June 6).</LD>
<LD>   I am impressed with his plan to address this problem now and in
the future. However, in closing, Mahony mentions "... the great harm
that has been done to so many people by this small number of
priests." Now we are back to the Catholic position of invincible
infallibility. Mahony isn't saying he or the Catholic hierarchy did
anything wrong. It was "them." Just a small number of priests.</LD>
<LD>   I don't believe a participating wrongdoer can hide behind even a
good solution.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas E. Allen</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was both outraged and disgusted reading the Catholic Church's
proposal for dealing with child sexual abuse ("Bishops Call for Abuse
Crackdown," June 5). The U.S. bishops' Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual
Abuse certainly reinforces the fact that the sexual abuse of children
continues to be the perfect crime. Allowing some priests, under
bizarre conditions, one past sexual abuse occurrence borders on the
ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   Forgiveness and redemption notwithstanding, the time has come for
the Catholic membership to steadfastly question its hierarchy's
authority in this matter. Our society has a zero-tolerance policy in
the area of child sexual abuse and the rule of law dictates that we
all abide by it, even the mighty Catholic Church. In this citizen's
opinion, the bishops' response is unacceptable and must be rejected
... or tragic consequences will escalate.</TE>
<TE>   Edna M. Tobias</TE>
<TE>   Hermosa Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The bishops' call for defrocking and reporting to authorities any
future commission of sexual abuse by a priest says nothing about any
equally heinous and illegal future act of complicity by a bishop.
Since compliance by a bishop is voluntary and the need to protect the
hierarchy's power and preeminence is inherent in the system, where's
the reform?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Leader of Breakaway Bid Has a Hollywood Flair," June 5: What a
wake-up call, reading about Gene La Pietra and the Hollywood
secession movement. It is now painfully obvious that The Times is in
the pocket of City Hall in its anti-secession perspective.</LD>
<LD>   How about discussing the issues of secession as opposed to
highlighting the private life of a highly motivated, dedicated and
inspiring humanitarian like La Pietra? It's so tiresome being served
up a daily dose of selective news based on the agenda of City Hall
and its anti-secession advocates.</LD>
<LD>   How about sticking to the salient issues and not retreating into
coloring all the good intentions of a well-meaning individual? It is
glaringly obvious to anyone who has lived or worked in Hollywood
since 1962 (as I have) that the city has been neglected. Ask anyone
who lives and/or works there. Having started out with no opinion
regarding secession, I am now a rabid secessionist--thanks to all the
issues raised by its chief advocate, La Pietra. More power to him and
to the citizens of Hollywood.</LD>

<TE>   Only a few days after a Times reporter described the shallow
newspaper coverage of Valley secession (May 31, June 1) we now have
Steve Lopez's June 5 column as an example of a continuing problem
("You Wanna Start Your Own City? Goodbye and Good Luck"). Lopez makes
fun of Mayor James Hahn for visiting a small "One L.A." rally in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez also states sarcastically that "it's time to cut the Valley
loose." Rather, it might be more helpful to say "goodbye and good
luck" to Lopez and hire a columnist who thinks it is more important
to analyze the divisive issues in our city than it is to be flippant.</TE>

<LD>"The Business of America Is Out of Control" (Commentary, June 5) was
perhaps one of the most ridiculous commentaries I've read in quite
some time. To suggest that customers are rebelling against corporate
greed by essentially trashing store shelves does nothing short of
excuse those individuals--who are nothing more than rude, lazy and
inconsiderate to their fellow human beings who are in the unfortunate
position of "toiling" in retail. These sorts of customers are too
lazy to rebel against anything.</LD>

<HD>Prison: For Punishment or Rehabilitation?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Must Reexamine Manson Follower," June 4: So Superior Court
Judge Bob N. Krug needs the state Board of Prison Terms to be more
specific about the reasons for denying convicted murderer Leslie Van
Houten parole, stating that it wasn't enough merely to claim that she
was unsuitable for release because of the gravity of the crime. Try
telling that to Rosemary LaBianca's family.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't aware that there had to be any further reason to keep
people behind bars other than for the simple fact that they broke the
law. We have this sick notion in our society these days that prison
is for rehabilitation. It is not. People do time behind bars to serve
justice. Van Houten is in jail for her unbelievably heartless and
savage crimes, not to be rehabilitated. Van Houten was originally
sentenced to death. She should be on her knees thanking God every day
that she was spared that fate.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Cavanaugh</LD>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the court's ruling on Van Houten's parole board hearing:
I find it truly repugnant that Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer can continually defy the courts. Where is the Democratic
Party leadership in Sacramento? The court ruled that the parole board
had to follow the law and state the reason for denying parole for Van
Houten. It also ruled that according to the law the parole board must
state what the inmate can do to improve his or her chances to gain
parole. The parole boards are not doing this.</TE>
<TE>   My question to the attorney general and the man sitting in the
governor's office: Do you think all residents of California are
stupid? You are breaking the law, and you are using your office to do
it. Will the voters continue to stand for this? I pray daily they
will not. And, I am a Democrat.</TE>

<LD>Re "Filling the Need for Speed," June 5: I have been motorcycle
riding on Sundays with the same group since the early 1970s. Usually,
Ortega Highway in Orange County is part of the ride. Agreed, there
are occasional idiots, as can be found in any complex endeavor where
a training class has not been conducted, but they are few.</LD>
<LD>   Motorcyclists are a friendly and responsible group. We are polite
with the California Highway Patrol officers and they are friendly and
polite to us--even inquisitive as to our thoughts about certain
bikes. The Harley riders and sport bike riders are each out there for
fundamentally the same reason, and we are all friendly with one
another, whether it be at the Roadhouse on Ortega Highway or Cook's
Corner in Santiago Canyon.</LD>

June 5: Excuse me--Jerry Taylor and Roger Berliner think that
President Bush will even think about making sure that "the energy
bill that emerges out of the upcoming conference committee does not
contain this $40-billion taxpayer gift to a few at the expense of the
rest of us"? This is the energy president. He is all for the big

certainly doesn't care that the American taxpayer will pay for this

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Putting the Rapid Back in Rapid Transit," June 4:</LD>
<LD>   While waiting for an MTA bus at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax
Avenue after spending another fine Friday evening at the L.A. County
Museum of Art, I had the most curious experience. At the Metro Rapid
bus stop is an electronic marquee, and it was announcing that the
next Metro Rapid bus would be at the stop in five minutes. A veteran
of MTA bus service, I was not only skeptical, I chuckled: Another
grand idea by the MTA, announcing approaching buses. I was certain
that the announcement was off and had probably been stuck for hours
at "Five minutes for the next bus."</LD>
<LD>   But then it changed to four minutes, and then three minutes. I
thought to myself that there was a fat chance that an MTA Metro Rapid
bus would be at this stop in the announced time. Then it read two
minutes. And then the marquee boldly pronounced that the bus was
approaching. I was incredulous at the nerve of the MTA to announce
that a bus was approaching. There was no way on Earth that the MTA
could have engineered a working bus stop.</LD>
<TE>   I looked up Wilshire Boulevard and there was the bus, coming to my
stop. I could not believe it--it worked. I nearly missed the bus as I
almost fainted from the shock of the whole ordeal of experiencing the
timely efficiency of this MTA bus route, but I revived myself to
board and began my journey home.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Hetz</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For about a year I took the Metro Rapid line back and forth to
work from 14th Street in Santa Monica to Beverly Drive in Beverly
Hills and nearly always found the ride itself a pleasure. However,
actually getting on the bus was often difficult. Metro Rapid may take
great pride in its speed, but it ought to be more concerned with
actually picking up and dropping off riders.</TE>
<TE>   Few things are more annoying to a bus rider than to run a long
Beverly Hills block only to see the bus speed off when your
fingertips touch the door; to walk to the bus stop while being passed
by five buses tailgating or passing one another, only to wait more
than 30 minutes for the next bus; or to be refused entry to a bus
waiting at a light, only to again wait 30 minutes at the official
stop.</TE>
<TE>   And not once did I see the use of the much-advertised device that
delays signals from turning red. I suggest the following: No Metro
Rapid bus should follow within sight of its predecessor; drivers
should wait for runners; buses already waiting at a red light should
be allowed to let passengers on or off as long as it does not delay
them. This last suggestion would do much to alleviate rider
frustration at being passed by numerous buses while walking to the
widely separated official Metro Rapid stops. I sent these suggestions
to the MTA many months ago, but of course never got a reply.</TE>

<DH>Intoxicated about the future, some Marshall High seniors
snub drugs and drink</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deafening Eminem rap is ricocheting off the walls of the John
Marshall High School gym packed with 850 partying teenagers in
Hawaiian garb--girls in coconut bras and low-slung sarongs; guys in
pink and yellow hibiscus-popping shirts and leis. For Marshall
students, this is the party of the season--the Aloha Dance--a
farewell fete for seniors making the jump into the real world.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's college or moving out of the house or nailing down a
job--or in many cases, all three--the class of 2002 is outta here
June 27, graduation day. But right now, on a recent late Friday
night, all that matters is get-your-freak-on dancing 'til midnight.</LD>
<LD>   For many soon-to-be grads, the annual dance is a much-anticipated
get-together--affordable at $10 a pop and free of the stress
associated with last month's prom at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel.
Prom night easily costs a couple more than $500 for the right look,
limousine, dinner tickets and after-party fun.</LD>
<TE>   A little more than two weeks after Marshall's May 4 prom, an
18-year-old Tustin high school senior named Cathy Isford died after
taking Ecstasy for what she told her sister would be the last time
and mixing it with alcohol at a prom after-party. The tragedy struck
fear in the hearts of parents and educators, but, perhaps
predictably, didn't seem to hit home with as much force among the
prom-going public.</TE>
<TE>   At Marshall, which straddles Silver Lake and Los Feliz, news of
Isford's death "just kind of flew by," said 18-year-old student body
president Sherllene Aquino. "Things like that seem to be so common
nowadays. It's sad that we accept it just as it is. But people make
choices."</TE>
<TE>   Here, at the Aloha Dance, where at least two armed campus police
officers are on duty, soda and fountain water are as good as it gets.
But no one is complaining. Ten administrators and staff have their
radar on, always moving, dropping into cliques of kids, scanning the
crowd for anything suspicious or anyone who shouldn't be there--like
the kid who jumped the fence and had to leave when he couldn't
produce ID.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside the darkened gym, students are packed shoulder to
shoulder at a close-encounters dance-athon fueled by deejays spinning
everything from techno to salsa under a spinning strobe light that
hovers in a corner like a UFO. Eau de high school spirit--that funky,
dance sweat smell--fills the space.</TE>
<TE>   At about 10 p.m., the house lights come up. It's time for the
evening's main attraction, the coronation of the Aloha King and
Queen. Students shout for their favorites and go wild--jumping,
shoving, clapping, hugging each other--when Jeff Maniego and Idalia
Hernandez are crowned the royal duo. Away from the crush, they both
agree their idea of a good time is dancing and being drug-free.</TE>
<TE>   "Ecstasy? I would never do it. Never," 17-year-old Maniego says as
he adjusts a newly placed straw hat on his head as the crowd's
favorite. Maniego plans to study criminal justice at Cal State
Northridge and hopes to become an FBI agent. "I'm the wussiest person
in the world. I will not drink. I will not smoke," he says. "Sure,
the pressure is there to do all that, but none of that interests me.
I would never let my parents down."</TE>
<TE>   Neither would Hernandez, also 17, and set on a career in the music
industry. "There's definitely a lot of people who want to bring you
down, but you have to be strong on the inside," she says. "If you're
not strong enough, then you only have yourself to blame for going
down that destructive road."</TE>
<TE>   Other seniors agree. But, hey, this is a full-throttle dance--and
seriously, not the right time or place to talk seriously. Not when
you want to act silly and find friends and hug them and gossip and
pose for photos and then get lost in the music that is making your
socks fall to your ankles.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the dance, half a dozen seniors--who like 80% of
their 700 classmates are college-bound--gathered to talk about the
pressures they have faced as high schoolers. The Cliffs Notes
version? Growing up is hard (although their language is much
crasser), but you can get through it if you lead, not if you follow.
Be yourself. Don't show off, don't procrastinate, make friends with
your teachers. Have fun, but act responsibly. Know your limits and
the consequences when it comes to drinking and drugs. And even though
they get frustrated with their nosy parents, a lot of them credit the
adults in their lives with keeping them out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty much a clean teenager. I don't drink, don't smoke,"
says Geri Sadek, 17, who plans to study broadcasting at Cal State
Northridge. Sadek says she's been around friends that "have drank too
much and say offensive things when I try to be a good friend and help
to keep them out of harm. But what does that do to you? You're being
a mother. But if you go to a party and find out that your friend has
gotten drunk--or worse--you naturally want to try to take care of
them."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not worth it," she says about drinking and taking drugs.
"What's so great about showing off to your friends and then dying
because you drank or did drugs? Big deal."</TE>
<TE>   She says her parents grilled her about her prom night, both before
and after. "Parents tell you they trust you, but they also have
doubts," Sadek says, adding that her mom, especially, "keeps me on
check. I have a cell phone, and I get, like, four messages every,
what, 45 minutes? I've been brought up under so many strict rules at
home that I can't imagine staying out after 11:30 p.m., even if I
try. Honestly."</TE>
<TE>   On prom night, Sadek says, she and eight girlfriends made the
evening memorable by wearing garters and flashing the elasticized
ruffle every now and then. "You don't have to get drunk, take drugs
or do anything like Ecstasy which will screw you over beyond belief,
to have fun. Why would anyone want to mess up when you have the
opportunity to go to college? I now have the chance to make something
of myself."</TE>
<TE>   She's also looking forward to sharing an apartment with her
classmate, Aquino, the student body president, who also will attend
Northridge. "I hardly go out and party," Aquino says. "My parents
trust me. They ask me where I'm going and what time I'm gonna be
home, but they don't really factor in drugs and alcohol and all that
because they know me. I don't do that kind of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   She says her friends "talk about certain things you shouldn't try
just to have fun. There are other ways of having fun without having
to go straight to drugs or alcohol. Sometimes they listen. Most of
the time they don't," she says, adding that no matter "how close you
are to your friends, there's just this wall there when it comes to
stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   Kory Daldalyan, 17, will attend Cal State Los Angeles and major in
biology and music. He plays piano and for the last three years was a
linebacker for the Marshall football team. This year, he was voted
prom king.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a balance in everything, including partying," he
says. "If you're with a group of friends and you're all sober and
having a good time with each other, you're strong. But, like, if
you're alone, you're the target."</TE>
<TE>   He says his experience with some friends who drink and do drugs
has taught him that "a lot of teenagers don't know their limits. They
drink to have a good time because it gives them a buzz" and makes
them "party harder."</TE>
<TE>   On occasion, he's been able to discourage a few friends not to go
overboard. If they pay attention, they're real friends, he says. "But
if they're like, 'Ah, forget that, leave me alone' and curse you out
and threaten to fight you, then they're not your friend anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Charles-Jordan Manigo, 17, an athlete, agrees. "I don't know why
people do it. Maybe because everybody else is doing it," says Manigo,
who wants to study kinesiology at College of the Canyons in Santa
Clarita and hopes to own sports rehabilitation centers one day. "I
don't find that fun because you don't remember anything afterwards.
When I feel that my close friends are about to go overboard, that's
when I'm like, 'OK, c'mon, let's go. I'll drive you home or you can
sleep at my house.' I'm not their parent, but I tell them I don't
like drugs. I don't like the way people look when they are
intoxicated or when they are on drugs or how they act."</TE>
<TE>   Manigo credits his mother, Carol, for keeping him straight. "I
know she would kill me" if he ever succumbed to drinking and using
drugs. He says he would disappoint her, his grandmother and embarrass
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Common sense tells him, "If you have any doubt before you're gonna
do something, then you know that you shouldn't be doing it." Besides,
he adds, with a completely straight face: "I'm scared of my mom."</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Flores, 17, has been accepted at UC Riverside, where
she'll study psychology. Her senior prom exceeded her expectations.
"My dad is an LAPD officer. He didn't let me go to the prom in my
ninth-, 10th- and 11th-grade years, so when it came to my 12th-grade
year, I was ready for it."</TE>
<TE>   And her friends were ready for a warehouse after-party she hosted,
complete with laser lights, a fog machine, a deejay and plenty of
security, including her father, Joel Flores.</TE>
<TE>   She's appreciative that her parents agreed to the party, where
punch was served and guests "acted responsibly." They know many of
her friends and cared enough to be present to make sure "everything
was fine. I wouldn't be the person I am today without my parents,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Nydine Campana, 17, says she's cool with her parents wanting to
know what she's up to. "I want my parents to have the whole
discipline issue going on with me, to let me know what's right and
wrong, teach me morals and all that," she says. Campana wants to
study business and journalism at either Cal State Northridge or Santa
Monica College.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of my friends who do drugs, who drink, who are
having sex and their parents don't know. Parents are so not aware
what their kids are doing. I think parents should be more involved
with their kids and ask questions," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Like others, she worries about friends, especially "if they are
under the influence" of alcohol or drugs. "If you see that they are
going over their limit, you sit there, talk to them, try to get their
mind off of it. It's my job as a friend to be understanding and
help."</TE>
<TE>   But at the Aloha Dance, there's no need for that. Campana is here
to dance. "That's my thing, my natural high." She's also here to say
goodbye. "That's what aloha means, right?" she asks, and just as
quickly corrects herself. "It also means hello, you know, like the
next phase of our lives that waits for us."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At the age of 18, most future magazine editors and publishers leave
home for college. Not Jules Rutledge: He was off to spend a few years
in another sort of institution: jail. His is not your run-of-the-mill
media resume, but then FELON, his magazine, isn't your usual
publication.</LD>
<LD>   For three quarterly issues, FELON, an acronym for From Every Level
of Neighborhoods, has glared from newsstands nationwide and flown out
of the magazine's bare Harlem storefront office. The magazine is set
to be published every other month, starting this summer. "The word,
the name, is like a stop sign," says 29-year-old Rutledge, tapping on
his desk, which is bare save for a deck of cards, a warden-size key
ring and an incessantly buzzing cell phone. "And the magazine, it's
all about being real with society. I keep correspondence with a lot
of incarcerated people, people I met in jail. And they didn't have a
voice on the outside, and there wasn't a magazine that was being
real. Now there is," he says, leaning his big, black-T-shirted frame
back in his office chair.</LD>
<TE>   A recent crop of independently owned and run magazines has
emerged--Don Diva, FEDS (an acronym as well, for Finally Every
Dimension of the Street), and now FELON, aimed at what's popularly
referred to as the "urban" market. These publications feature
profiles of established and emerging black celebrities, especially
denizens of the world of hip-hop, often on a tight budget that comes
from album and fashion advertising and newsstand sales (FELON costs
$4.99). Rutledge, who after prison ran a delivery service, a cell
phone and beeper store, and a security business out of his Frederick
Douglass Boulevard storefront, was a founding partner in Don Diva
magazine. He left, as he says, "due to creative differences"--his
aversion to the magazine's inclusion of women's nudity and
"glorification of violence"--and set up his own shop.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a void in publishing when it comes to black
youth culture and the American poor, and these magazines are helping
to fill that void," says Bakari Kitwana, author of "The Hip Hop
Generation: The Crisis in African American Culture" (Basic Civitas
Books, 2002) and a former national affairs editor of the
groundbreaking hip-hop magazine the Source.</TE>
<TE>   Kitwana says that central to that general void is a discussion of
prison culture. "Prison culture spills in to hip-hop culture. Inside
and outside, the boundaries between prison and the larger culture
have blurred, and yet there's no experience of that culture in
American popular culture by and large, unless it treats it as
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Enter FELON. The magazine forms its identity not just from its
eye-catching and brow-raising name, but from Rutledge's personal
connection to incarceration. While he insists that the magazine isn't
political, Rutledge's empathy is the magazine's imprint. (He
estimates he writes 70% of the content.) An introduction to a Q&amp;A
with rapper Chi-Ali is an impassioned play-by-play of his sentencing
to 40 years after being captured in the Bronx after more than a year
on the lam. Most interviews in the magazine allude to or explore
imprisonment. And Rutledge includes stories in detailed legalese
about cases of former Black Panthers and other men in prison, urging
hearings and follow-ups. "I have some good news from one of our
comrades that had a capital murder in Alabama. He was found guilty
the first time around and sentenced to death by the electric chair!"
he writes. "And he's no longer on Death Row or faces life in prison,
so one day he should be able to take his kids to the movie and the
park!" Rutledge says he's in no way trying to gloss over the crimes
that have landed men in jail, but rather that he's challenging a
system he believes incarcerates the innocent along with the guilty,
and hands down sentences to both that he deems overly aggressive and
unjust.</TE>
<TE>   He refuses to discuss his own crimes, saying only that he spent
three years in jail as an adult and that his high school experience
was interrupted by a year in a juvenile prison.</TE>
<TE>   Terrance Rutledge, the magazine's managing editor, wanders into
the office in a bright blue terry cloth ensemble and gleaming white
sneakers, and sits beside his brother. He insists that the magazine
isn't about the prison system or the culture it spawns, and carefully
explains that not everyone in the magazine is a felon (despite his
brother's theoretical musing, "it's one thing to live life and not
get caught for it, and another thing to have a felony--you could say
they all have felonies, I guess"). The magazine isn't about and for
felons, he maintains; it's just an acronym. "But it is about not
forgetting the comrades--the people who go to jail and are
forgotten," he says. With a solemn nod, Jules adds, "When you're on
the inside, there's no hope no more."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, FELON can appear menacing on the newsstand. On
the current cover, staring out from under the banner "Men of
Respect," are the faces of rap impresarios like Fat Joe, the CEO of a
record company called Terror Squad, and Irv Gotti, the CEO of Murder
Inc., along with Jalil Mantaqim, an imprisoned leader of the Black
Liberation Army. Displayed beside bubble-gum pink teen mags, and a
parade of chipper celebrity smiles, FELON hardly looks like a
publication with public service as its mission.</TE>
<TE>   But that's just how Jules Rutledge describes his magazine--some
cautionary tales from people who have been deep into a cycle of crime
and violence, words to the wise from the genuine source, like Pee Wee
Kirkland, a street basketball legend and criminal who tells his
readers, "You end up going from being a thug to being a gangster,
like I did. You spend the rest of your life either at home or in
prison wondering where did it all begin. I'd rather put a bullet in
my head than to glorify or relive the life I lived, or hurt again the
people I hurt."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a teacher wrote to the magazine to say she'd like to use
it as a teaching tool at her Brooklyn school (although she can't
because there are "too many errors in the articles," she
writes--there's even a typo in her published letter, and each issue
is riddled with such flaws).</TE>
<TE>   At FELON's heart is a desire to speak to people inside the prison
system as well as those outside of it. For the next issue, Jules
Rutledge will travel to prisons nationwide to visit 10 men who have
been sentenced to 200 to 300 years apiece--with the intent to talk to
them about his experiences on the outside, and to communicate their
stories to his readers.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside, they'll get to sit down with someone who publishes a
magazine and talk. All they get from the outside is the TV, you know,
the Soul Train awards. I need to show there's no difference between
us two. They need something to give them hope. And respect." The
insistence upon respect is clear: On each cover appears a
cinema-style rating of "R" beside a warning: "Restricted: requires
honor, loyalty, and respect." A tough demand from a title like FELON,
but one it seems determined to earn.</TE>

<LD>Annette Reed's students at Oakmont Elementary in Claremont have these
suggestions and comments on teasing.</LD>
<LD>   * One day I was waiting in the handball line and someone said,
"You stink at handball." He hurt my feelings. I play very hard and
beat a lot of people now. I like it when I win on the handball court.
(Jacob, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * People tease my friend about having curly hair. It hurts her
feelings a lot. She's been teased since kindergarten. She says she'd
pay $1,000 to get straight hair. But she still has curly hair.
(Samantha, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * My friend has been teased when he cries and throws a tantrum.
People call him a crybaby and he does not like it one bit. They keep
on calling him crybaby and he just keeps on crying. (Scott, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * My friends teased me about my name. I felt sad and mad. Some
third-graders even called me stupid. (Ariel, 7)</TE>
<TE>   Two of Ken Takata's second-graders at Eucalyptus Elementary in
Hawthorne had the following experiences.</TE>
<TE>   * One time, my sister called me "dumb nut" and "freak of nature."
I had to relax by breathing deep through my nose. I got away from her
so I wouldn't lose my temper. (Bryant, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * Some kid called me four eyes because I wear glasses. I told him
to stop. He didn't stop, so I told the teacher and he got in trouble.
(Natnael, 8)</TE>
<TE>   Students at Charnock Road Elementary in Los Angeles sent these
comments.</TE>
<TE>   * I have never been teased, but if people did, I'd ignore them. If
they did it again, I'd warn them by saying, "This is the second time
you teased me, and I'll tell if you do it again." (Nicolas, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * Yes, I have been teased by many people. Sometimes they are just
playing with me, and sometimes they're doing it to make fun of me.
When I was little, I used to hit people, but I stopped because it was
wrong to do that. So when people tease me, I tell my mom or dad, a
teacher or an adult. (Bilal, 8)</TE>

<HD>Books in the 'Hood</HD>
<DH>The Los Feliz library is collecting every possible volume
that in some way relates to the local area</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some libraries are known for their trove of presidential papers or
rare old prints. The Los Feliz branch of the Los Angeles Public
Library has ambitions closer to home. For the last three years, the
library's staff and a growing number of its users have been building
a collection of books about the surrounding neighborhood. The Los
Feliz in Literature Collection now includes about 300 titles and can
be found in a well-marked nook near the library's windows.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl Yonezawa, senior librarian at the branch, oversees the
project. In her quiet way--a good trait in a librarian--she has
encouraged local authors, business owners, politicians and other
regular borrowers to contribute by donating books and related
materials to the cause.</LD>
<LD>   Rip up another myth about the city. Neighborhoods do exist here,
lots of them. In Los Feliz, as in any number of small communities,
people are as loyal to their home turf as they are to their brand of
running shoes.</LD>
<TE>   "I had the idea for a Los Feliz collection from the time we opened
our building in 1999," says Yonezawa. Officially the territory
extends from Griffith Park south to Franklin Avenue, and west from
Hyperion Avenue to Western Avenue. Yonezawa, however, doesn't hold to
a strict definition because some regulars at the Los Feliz branch
live in nearby Silver Lake, where they don't have a public library of
their own.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other L.A. library branches also have assembled
collections about local history and culture. Little Tokyo's holdings
include the city's largest on Japanese American culture. The Goldwyn
Hollywood branch is the best place to learn about Hollywood history.
Chinatown's extensive focus on California's Chinese community
includes books written in Mandarin and Cantonese as well as in
English.</TE>
<TE>   "Each branch tries to respond to the community where the library
users live," says Yonezawa. But it is the senior librarian who gives
a collection its shape and color. "Los Feliz is a very eclectic
neighborhood," she says. "In this library, anything goes. Books on
henna tattoos and books on how to crochet both circulate."</TE>
<TE>   Library services were introduced to Los Feliz in 1924, but the
books were always housed in a rented space. The permanent address at
Hillhurst and Franklin avenues is the former site of an apartment
house where actor Leonardo DiCaprio grew up.</TE>
<TE>   From the day the new library building opened, Yonezawa began
tending the collection like an angler with time on her side. "If
people come in and say, 'I'm new here,' I walk them down to the Los
Feliz collection," she says. When she can, she slips in a word about
the book donation drive. "Patrons tell us they've read a book that
includes the neighborhood," says Yonezawa, 47. "Sometimes they'll
donate a copy."</TE>
<TE>   To call more attention to the project, Yonezawa began a "lounge
chair literature" series and invited Paula Woods, a popular detective
novelist who lives in the area, as the first guest. Woods had just
published "Inner City Blues," which includes a car chase scene in Los
Feliz. After the program she gave an autographed copy to the library.</TE>
<TE>   That set a standard. "If a book even mentions Los Feliz, it fits
in," Yonezawa says. Mention is a key concept here. Carolyn Weathers'
novel "Crazy" uses the library for one scene. That was more than
enough for her book to make the cut. Other books in the collection
don't mention the area at all. "White Oleander," a dark coming-of-age
novel, qualified because author Janet Fitch lives near the library.</TE>
<TE>   With such a wide-open approach to collecting, the range of topics
has grown in broad and quirky directions. Councilman Tom LaBonge,
whose district includes Los Feliz, has donated books on the Los
Angeles River and Sunset Boulevard. "It's my local branch," he says
of Los Feliz. "And I grew up using the public library. I try to help
out."</TE>
<TE>   Since the hills above the library are dotted with houses designed
by 20th century master architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard
Neutra and R.M. Schindler, books about their work are cataloged under
the Los Feliz collection. A cookbook put out by Franklin Avenue
Elementary School was a recent donation.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the neighborhood is part of East Hollywood. Early
stars of the silver screen, including W.C. Fields and Deanna Durbin,
lived in the area at one time. That gives Hollywood tour guide books
a place in the collection.</TE>
<TE>   True crime stories that took place in Los Feliz add an edge. In
August 1969 the Charles Manson "family" murdered actress Sharon Tate
in her Benedict Canyon home. Two nights later they tore through Los
Feliz, killing Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Abee, who lived in Los Feliz 10 years ago before he moved to
Echo Park, set several stories from his "King Planet" near the
library. One of them uses Griffith Observatory for a backdrop. Abee
describes the view from there as if it were a turnout on a scenic
drive. "You can see the whole city," he says. From the library
windows you can see the observatory dome. "Los Feliz is one of the
city's bohemian areas, with an outsider energy that attracts me. You
can be totally yourself."</TE>
<TE>   At Skylight Books on Vermont Avenue, a quick walk from the
library, the section on Los Angeles is a centerpiece. Kerry Slattery,
general manager of the independent store, a haven for local writers,
offers shoppers a deal: Buy a book for the Los Feliz in Literature
Collection and get a discount as well as a tax deduction form.
Slattery says her customers inspire her. "A lot of people who live in
Los Feliz have been here all their life," she says. "There's a fierce
loyalty. They're very involved in the neighborhood. If they're new
here, they want to know more about the area. They've got a strong
sense of the local history."</TE>
<TE>   Slattery and Yonezawa work as a team. The store's newsletter has
plugged the library's special collection, and the library invites
Slattery to set up a table during "lounge chair literature" meetings
to sell the book being discussed. "Pearl and I have a similar view of
our role in the neighborhood," Slattery says. "We see ourselves as
community-oriented. If I'm out of a book they want, I tell them to
check the library. And Pearl tells people that Skylight Books is
around the corner."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Fever Is a Slam Dunk for Civic Pride</HD>

<LD>At the TGI Friday's bearing Magic Johnson's name, they'll begin
lining up this afternoon long before the Lakers begin to play,
knowing it will take hours to get into the bar, never mind getting a
beer or finding a seat with a view of the game on TV. These, a
regular tells me, are die-hard fans who never miss a Lakers game.</LD>
<LD>   Across town, at my neighborhood version of the chain, the crowd
last week was considerably more eclectic, maybe less sophisticated,
but certainly just as much in love with this team, this game.</LD>
<LD>   A pair of blond women were perched at the bar, accepting the
good-natured ribbing of a buddy, who said they wouldn't know a jump
shot from a jump ball. Along one wall was a group of Latino men
wearing soccer jerseys, lining up empty Coronas on the windowsill
behind them. Outside on the smoking patio, a stocky black woman in a
backward cap and a Lakers jersey lighted a cigarette for a guy with
spiky blond hair, nose and eyebrow rings and a skateboard resting
near his feet.</LD>
<TE>   And I found myself appreciating the spectacle almost as much as I
enjoyed the game.</TE>
<TE>   The parties are as much a reflection of our passion this season as
purple-and-gold flags on cars and a jam-packed Staples Center on a
day when the game is actually being played in a gym 3,000 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   On days like today, as the Lakers try to take the third game of
this championship series, a city threatening to splinter into pieces
jams together with its own unruly version of civic pride.</TE>
<TE>   USC professor Todd Boyd ran into the phenomenon last Sunday as he
was rushing through the Dallas airport to make his plane back to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I encountered this mass of people crowded outside the bar in the
concourse. I knew what they were doing, and I tried to avoid them
because I was taping the game [at home] and didn't want to know what
was happening." But once the game ended, everyone filing onto the
plane seemed to be crowing about the Lakers' win or babbling into a
cell phone, replaying the basketball game with friends. Even the
pilot announced the score of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd has made a career of studying sports, particularly
basketball, and their influence on our culture. He teaches in the
university's film school, has edited two books on sports and culture
and is writing another, to be published next spring, on basketball
and American culture. To hear him tell it, our communal preoccupation
this playoff season reflects not just our affection for the Lakers
but our collective longing to bond, to be part of something that is
larger than a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports is one thing in society today that tends to cut across
lines of race, class, even gender," said Boyd. "It's one of the few
things we can rally around that reflects a city's identity."</TE>
<TE>   So during the playoffs, public places where we watch the game
"become the equivalent of a town hall meeting, an old school
community center, at least for the moment. People from all walks of
life are in the same space, their attention focused on the same
thing. It feeds our desire to be part of the crowd, to be connected
to something in a city where everyone tends to go their own way."</TE>
<TE>   If last weekend is any example, Staples Center will be filled
today with thousands of fans who have stood in line for hours to buy
tickets to watch the arena's giant TV screens as the Lakers play in
New Jersey. "Obviously they can't see it as well as they could if
they were watching their own TV at home, but people want to feel like
they're participating," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   In arenas, airports, restaurants, bars, the crowd makes the
contest more than just a basketball game, more even than an exercise
in civic pride. "It's entertainment," Boyd says. "A party, a
celebration, a chance to release some anxiety." And it doesn't even
matter if you understand the game.</TE>
<TE>   Real basketball aficionados won't likely be perched on bar stools
today to watch the game, but holed up alone or with a few friends in
front of their TVs. You can count Boyd among them. For him,
basketball is not just a subject of study but a personal passion. And
a game is a "solitary experience," best enjoyed alone.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are around, they tend to talk and distract me from my
mission, which is to see the game," he said. "It's just not the same
when you're surrounded by a bunch of people who are there for the
beer or the camaraderie or the public celebration and don't know that
the reason the Lakers [struggle] is their inability to defend the
pick-and-roll."</TE>
<TE>   For Boyd, that unfamiliarity "sort of kills the vibe."</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, it's an ignorance that lets us believe, for a
few hours at least, that we're one big, happy family. And that may
not keep the Valley, the Harbor and Hollywood in L.A.'s grasp, but it
certainly keeps the vibe alive.</TE>

<LD>Placido Domingo didn't have to sing a note at the Society of Singers'
11th annual Ella Awards Gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. As guest of
honor, he was in front of the footlights as singers from every
musical genre paid tribute to the tenor's stellar career.</LD>
<LD>   The award, named for Ella Fitzgerald, its first recipient in 1989,
recognizes an artist whose achievements in the music world are
matched by dedication to community and humanitarian causes. Domingo,
who serves as artistic director of both the L.A. and Washington,
D.C., operas, is the first opera singer to be so honored. Past
awardees have included Julie Andrews, Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Peggy
Lee and Frank Sinatra.</LD>
<LD>   Domingo, whose past laurels include Kennedy Center Honors and the
French Legion of Honor, described this one as personally significant
"because so many talented singers have not been as lucky in their
lives as I have. They have given so much; then their circumstances
change and in the end they have so little. It is a beautiful thing to
help them."</LD>
<TE>   The event raised $500,000 for the Society of Singers, which has
provided scholarships and aid for needy professional singers since
its founding by Ginny Mancini in 1984. Among those who have benefited
is basso James Butler, who has been aided since suffering two strokes
two years ago. Butler, who came from New York to perform at the
event, is now studying to become a signer for the deaf.</TE>
<TE>   Others offering musical tributes included Patti Austin, Kristin
Chenoweth, Nnenna Freelon, Rodney Gilfry, Julia Migenes, New York
police officer Daniel Rodriguez and the Society of Singers choir,
which backed the stars on "It's a Grand Night for Singing," the
evening's finale. Emcees for the May 30 event were Florence Henderson
and Garry Marshall; Mancini, Jeanne Hazard and Marc R. Staenberg
co-chaired the event.</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Alive</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 guests turned out for "L.A. Alive," a black-tie
dinner and auction that netted $1.3 million for the Music Center's
Fund for the Performing Arts. This year's extravaganza was staged
June 1 in an enormous tent at the home of Anne and Geoff Palmer, a
historic Beverly Hills estate built in 1913.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Fein, Carolyn Miller and Carol Weller chaired the gala
committee, which planned the biennial fund-raiser. Wallis Annenberg
and Charles Miller served as honorary chairmen.</TE>
<TE>   Fein and her crew have fine-tuned the silent auction over the
years. "We take pride in our quality," said Fein. "And sometimes it
requires diplomacy." If Aunt Beulah offers her hand-crocheted
antimacassars, Fein and her clever crew will package them with
something else that is very appealing. "We would never hurt anyone's
feelings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Van de Kamp, chairman of the Music Center, emceed the
evening, which featured a dinner catered by Wolfgang Puck and a live
auction conducted by Sotheby's Richard Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Three couples were honored for their contributions to the Music
Center: Sherry Lansing and William Friedkin, Mary and Norman Pattiz,
and Maria Hummer and Bob Tuttle.</TE>
<TE>   Among those in the crowd: Joanna and Sydney Poitier, Nancy and
Richard Riordan, Alice Huang and David Baltimore, Lonnie Anderson,
Evelyn and Mo Ostin, Ariana Huffington, Judith and Steven Krantz,
Jane and Robert Pisano, Lili and Richard Zanuck, C.Y. Lee, Janis and
Howard Berman, Edye and Eli Broad, Ginny and John Cushman, and Alyce
Williamson--who had the winning bid on Shaquille O'Neal's autographed
Laker jersey, which she wore home.</TE>

<TE>   Tony Awards West</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, wow, wow, fellas. Look at the old girl now, fellas,"
ever-avuncular Walter Cronkite said in a line stolen from "Hello,
Dolly!" as he presented the Julie Harris Lifetime Achievement Award
to his longtime friend Carol Channing. The award was presented on
behalf of the Hollywood theatrical community at last Sunday's West
Coast Tony Awards party. More than 300 attended the sixth annual
event, which raised $100,000 to benefit Aid for AIDS and the Actors'
Fund of America. This year's dinner and live telecast was staged at
the Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, not far from the Las Palmas
Theater, where Channing first bloomed as the "gladiola girl" in "Lend
an Ear" in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by old friends (including Cynthia Corley and Al Checco,
her co-stars in "Lend an Ear"; Jerry Herman, composer of "Hello,
Dolly!"; and event emcee Jo Anne Worley--Channing's onetime standby
as Dolly), Channing, 82, said: "I'm the happiest person in the world
tonight. Four years ago, I received the Tony for lifetime
achievement, but this award means more to me than anything because
this is where my career began."</TE>
<TE>   Event co-chairs were Ted Abenheim, J. Alexander Strautman and
David Westberg. Also in the crowd: David Michaels, Gretchen Wyler,
Karen Morrow, David Huddleston, Katherine and Fayard Nicholas, Bruce
Vilanch, Keene Curtis, Betty Weston, Dale Olson, Ariane Shovers,
Jomarie Ward, Henry Polic, Kevin Spirtas, Stuart Damon, Jason Graae
and designers Jerry Skeels and Randy McLaughlin.</TE>

<TE>   Art of Dining</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating his work as artist and teacher, supporters of the
Orange County Museum of Art honored John Baldessari at the 15th
annual Art of Dining benefit, which netted $450,000 for the
facility's exhibitions and education programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles artist is "known as one of the fathers of
conceptual art," museum curator and acting director Elizabeth
Armstrong told more than 400 guests attending the gala in a tented
pavilion near the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.
"His art has been a paragon of current ideas and sensibilities since
the '60s--and he has been a highly influential teacher and mentor to
several generations of artists."</TE>
<TE>   Baldessari praised the Newport Beach-based museum's current
exhibit, "2002 California Biennial," and told the crowd that its
support of the visual arts enriched the community.</TE>
<TE>   Philanthropist Henry T. Segerstrom, founding chairman of the
performing arts center and chairman of the National Business
Committee for the Arts, was also honored at the $1,000-per-ticket
dinner on June 1 that featured a champagne reception and
entertainment by vocalist Diane Schuur.</TE>
<TE>   As lights played on the pavilion walls, guests dined on rack of
lamb at tables spread with Egyptian cotton and set with square stone
chargers and gleaming stainless steel cutlery. Artworks by sculptor
Guy Ferrer and glassblower Caleb Siemon were used as centerpieces.
"We wanted our event to have a cutting edge," said Joan Riach, gala
co-chairwoman with Diane Coon and Erin Trunel.</TE>
<TE>   Guests included Al Milano, Darrel and Marsha Anderson, Chuck and
Twyla Martin, Gil and Victoria LeVasseur Jr., and Paul and Daranne
Folino.</TE>

<TE>   HomeAid</TE>
<TE>   HomeAid Orange County presented Rainbow of Hope Awards to
supporters of shelters for the homeless at a black-tie gala on June 1
that raised $165,000.</TE>
<TE>   Honored during the event at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport
Beach were Centex Homes, Morrison &amp; Foerster, Basenian/Lagoni
architects and BCI Framing and Drywall. Volunteer Jennifer Henry and
Mary's Shelter, an Orange County haven for homeless pregnant teenage
girls, also received awards at the gala chaired by Michelle Pate.
Proceeds will be used for HomeAid's programs to build and renovate
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Since it was founded in 1989 by the Orange County Chapter of the
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, HomeAid has completed
34 shelters. Eight more are in the works.</TE>

<LD>"It's a good day for making cookies," said Grandmother.</LD>

<LD>   "Can I make one extra-special cookie?" Rosie asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course," answered Grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   When that was done, Grandmother put the cookie sheet in the oven

<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion.</BD>
<DL>CANBERRA, Australia</DL>
<LD>When an American visitor here spoke recently about "the GWOT," his
no-nonsense Aussie hosts were confused, not having heard the U.S.
military acronym for the "Global War on Terrorism." Of course,
Australian military leaders have their own alphabet soup. They talk
about "the ICAT," the "International Coalition Against Terrorism."</LD>
<LD>   GWOTs and ICATs might sound like the kinds of exotic animals
Australia is famous for, but the two pieces of jargon highlight a
potential problem in the worldwide struggle against terrorism. It's
no accident that the Pentagon uses the word "war," while the
Australian military uses the word "coalition." This piece of language
trivia opens a window on little-recognized but serious tensions
between Washington and the military leaders of one of its staunchest
allies.</LD>
<LD>   What accounts for the different acronyms is not that Australians
shrink from the idea of war or take the threat less seriously than
Washington does. In fact, the Aussies are up to their eyeballs in
whatever you call the struggle against terror.</LD>
<TE>   Their military is operating at its highest pitch since Vietnam.
Australia's special-operations units, ships and planes are deeply
involved in the war in Afghanistan; its Special Air Service Regiment
was on the ground there from day one.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, geographically and in other ways, Australia may be
closer than the U.S. to the sources of extremism and violence that
make up the present-day terrorism threat. Although there has been no
Sept. 11 here thus far, Australians see the danger to themselves as
real.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that the idea of coalition is important to Australia,
especially where the U.S. is concerned. After all, this country has
fought alongside the U.S. and Britain in every major conflict since
World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, many of Australia's senior military leaders
believe that the Bush administration, in its rush to fight a war, has
forgotten about the idea of partnership. Especially the notion that
partnership involves listening.</TE>
<TE>   Australian officials believe that their location and long years of
close involvement with some of their predominantly Islamic neighbors
give them valuable insight into the current problem of terrorism.
They think Washington takes too little advantage of this insight. And
they worry that President Bush is being sold a bill of goods by some
other supposed allies in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia and Malaysia have drawn praise from Washington for
joining the war on terrorism, but Australian military officials say
both countries have used the GWOT as a screen for domestic political
crackdowns while doing little to combat global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the 'evidence' from Malaysian and Indonesian security
agencies gives every appearance of being manufactured for domestic
political and diplomatic purposes," said Greg Fealy, a former
Australian intelligence analyst, now a research fellow on Indonesia
at the Australian National University.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphatic anti-terrorism policy" pursued in Washington, Fealy
wrote recently, is exploited by the security services "to justify
Draconian steps against alleged 'terrorists,' [thereby running] the
risk of alienating an already skeptical Islamic community."</TE>
<TE>   "People being arrested in Malaysia are just part of the Islamic
opposition," another analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   Such insight may be lost on the Bush administration, many here
believe, because the president--and American leaders in general--are
in the habit of looking to Australia for troops and diplomatic
support but not for analysis and advice.</TE>
<TE>   That is true in the area of understanding the games being played
in a place like Malaysia and in the larger realm of strategic
thinking. In both respects, Australian military leaders believe their
views are not being heard.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dibb, director of the Strategic and Defence Studies Center at
Australian National University and the former head of the Australian
Joint Intelligence Organization, flat out dismisses the central
assumption behind Washington's response to Sept. 11. "We are not in a
radical new strategic era," Dibb says. He decries the Australian
reflex to scrap its established national security interests to retool
for the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   With war looming between India and Pakistan and a real possibility
of conflict not just between North and South Korea but between China
and Taiwan as well, Dibb questions what he calls one of the great
American and European myths about Asian defense: the obsolescence of
major war.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's military leaders are frustrated by the Bush
administration's indifference to their insights and also by the fact
that any kind of open break with the U.S. is unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no possibility for an ally like us not to stand next to
the United States," a senior officer said. In a world with a single
superpower, Australians also know that they have to pay an insurance
premium for U.S. protection. Still, some things grate.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the military resent what they see as an imperious U.S.
attitude, and this resentment has strained relations between the
Australian military and the civilian government of Prime Minister
John Howard, who is doing back flips to show unquestioning support
for Bush. He called Australia "America's deputy sheriff" in Southeast
Asia. So the military here doesn't see him as a real ally in getting
its message through to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But spending a week with the Australian Defence Force, as I
recently did, makes it pretty clear why Americans in uniform have
always sought out their Aussie counterparts in a crisis. It's a
combination of professionalism and companionship. From the ranks
through the generals and admirals, there is an openness and
engagement that make partnership attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Special Air Service Regiment fought alongside the U.S.
in the Vietnam War and other in difficult and unpopular missions,
such as Somalia in the 1990s. The regiment went to Kuwait on Oct. 11
last year, and its troops were the first allied soldiers to go into
Afghanistan on the ground, fighting alongside the U.S. up through
Operation Anaconda this year.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Australia is providing 1,100 military personnel in or
near Afghanistan, including F-18 fighter jets for air defense of the
U.S. bombers based in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and aerial
refueling planes flying from Kyrgyzstan, a country one defense chief
jokingly said he didn't know existed before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before his departure for an Asia summit meeting in
Singapore last week, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz noted
that "for some of our friends in East Asia ... the war on terrorism
seems in some ways perhaps remote."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz certainly wasn't referring to Australia. At the same
Singapore summit, Australian Defense Minister Robert M. Hill
described Australia's increasing efforts to work with "governments we
believe are going to seriously address these issues," specifically
Indonesia. "We see we have a particular responsibility in this part
of the world to make a positive contribution," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all their cooperation, Australia's military leaders are
unhappy. "I worry about Bush going over the deep end," says one of
the country's highest-ranking military officers.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls Australia's costly participation in the Vietnam War and
draws a blunt parallel with its mechanical political allegiance in
the war on terrorism. "I'm not sure 'All the way with LBJ' " is best
for the nation, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Paying too little attention to how the GWOT looks from the Land
Down Under may not be best for the U.S. either.</TE>

<HD>Mr. McCain Goes to Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CIEPLY</AU>
<BD>Michael Cieply, a Los Angeles journalist, writes
regularly about the film industry.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so many months ago, I had the pleasure of watching, in a Senate
hearing room, as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) took eight quavering
studio chiefs to the woodshed over their companies'
not-very-defensible practices in selling violent films to kids. I can
remember thinking at the time that McCain, then chairman of the
Commerce Committee, was, at least briefly, the most powerful man in
Hollywood. Overnight, the entertainment industry came up with a tough
new marketing and ratings policy. And the studios made a perceptible
shift in their production choices, backing away from teen-oriented
gore-fests like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream," and
moving toward the less egregious fare on this summer's schedule:
"Scooby-Doo," "Pumpkin," "Mr. Deeds" and so on.</LD>
<TE>   But power in Hollywood is a slippery thing--and this year,
apparently, the equation has changed. McCain has become what the
industry calls "a seller." He's peddling film rights to his
3-year-old autobiography, "Faith of My Fathers," which was optioned
to two independent producers best known for their remake of the war
drama "The Thin Red Line" and for a series of financial mishaps that,
as reported recently in the New York Times, landed the men or their
companies in Bankruptcy Court four times. The ultimate "buyers,"
however--the people with the power to "green light" the film--are
those same eight studio chiefs and their brethren. At least one of
them will have to put cash and muscle behind McCain's life story, if
it's ever to become a major motion picture or a television event.</TE>
<TE>   McCain's flyboy adventures and years of torture as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam may or may not be the stuff of great entertainment.
But they certainly give some wily media conglomerate a dirt-cheap way
to buy leverage over a politician who caused the industry significant
grief in the recent past.</TE>
<TE>   In examining McCain's film deal, the news media have made much of
the senator's having naively stumbled into business with Robert
Geisler and the recently deceased John Roberdeau. In court, the two
drew no fewer than three contempt citations, and, during the filming
of Fox's "The Thin Red Line," they were banned from the set by the
director and excoriated in a widely reported news release on
production company letterhead as "impostors and confidence men."</TE>
<TE>   More remarkable, though, is McCain's willingness to make himself a
supplicant to the very moguls he so recently called on the
carpet--and at the same time handing Hollywood enormous potential
power over his political future, notwithstanding his permanent
crusade against the power of money in politics.</TE>
<TE>   The senator would surely argue that he doesn't stand to profit
from any deal his producers ultimately make with a studio or network.
His $80,000 in option money has already been pledged to charity, and
it's reasonable to expect that he'd be just as careful with the
larger payments due on production. Yet the hundreds of thousands of
dollars a company might pay for rights to McCain's book (which was
co-written with Mark Salter) are nothing compared with the potential
myth-building value of a heavily marketed feature film or miniseries
that could put this war hero's story on the screen just as he begins
mustering his next presidential run. Who needs campaign dollars when
you've got AOL Time Warner or News Corp. or Disney touting your
finest moments on billboards or television inserts across the nation?</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, publicity of that sort will be all the more precious as
the McCain-sponsored strictures on soft-money contributions take
effect. Corporations and wealthy individuals may not be able to buy
favor with wheelbarrows of cash to the political parties any more.</TE>
<TE>   But they can certainly pick up an option on a willing politician's
book and dangle the carrot of a big-screen production for years on
end while playing the development game. Stay off the industry's back,
and your project may just bubble to the top of the stack. Get uppity
in the hearing chamber and, well, the script just didn't work for us.</TE>
<TE>   So even as his first-wave of campaign finance restrictions was
being signed into law, McCain was mimicking that most depressing
Hollywood cliche, the entertainment reporter who's hawking the
studios a screenplay on the side.</TE>
<TE>   He ought to know better, having been burned so badly in the past
from accepting the largess of failed savings and loan executive
Charles H. Keating Jr., a scandal that supposedly taught him how
desperately we need campaign reform.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope he pulls "Faith of My Fathers" from the movie market
before some studio embarrasses him by saying yes, and he starts
drafting a new raft of federal laws to regulate script sales.</TE>

Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Western leaders tried last week to reassure the world that tensions
between Pakistan and India need not lead to war. But in India and
Pakistan, where a million troops from the two countries glowered at
each other across the border, sabers continued to rattle. In a public
debate in Islamabad, the former chief of the Pakistan army, Gen.
Mirza Aslam Beg, declared: "We can make a first strike, and a second
strike or even a third." The dreadful vision of nuclear war left him
unmoved. "You can die crossing the street," he observed, "or you
could die in a nuclear war. You've got to die someday anyway."</LD>
<LD>   Across the border, India's defense minister, George Fernandes, in
an interview with the Hindustan Times, once voiced similar
sentiments: "We could take a strike, survive and then hit back.
Pakistan would be finished."</LD>
<LD>   Indian Defense Secretary Yogendra Narain took things a step
further in an interview with the Indian magazine Outlook: "A surgical
strike is the answer." But if that failed to resolve things, he said,
"we will retaliate and must be prepared for mutual destruction."</LD>
<TE>   Some find this talk of nuclear war terrifying. But while foreign
nationals stream out of both countries and numerous world leaders
call for peace and restraint, few Indians or Pakistanis are losing
much sleep. Thousands of artillery shells exchanged since the
beginning of this year may have changed--or destroyed--the lives of
border residents, but elsewhere in both countries the effects are
barely perceptible. Stock markets have flickered, but there is no run
on the banks or panic buying of necessities. Schools and colleges,
which generally close at the first hint of a real crisis, are
functioning normally.</TE>
<TE>   Why this nonchalance? A fatalistic Hindu belief that the stars
above determine our destiny, or the equivalent Muslim belief in jabr
(predestination), certainly accounts for part of it. Conversations
and discussions often end on the note "what will be, will be," after
which people shrug their shoulders and move on to something else. But
other reasons may be more important.</TE>
<TE>   Close government control over national television, especially in
Pakistan, has ensured that critical discussion of nuclear weapons and
nuclear war are not aired. Instead, in Pakistan's public squares and
at crossroads stand missiles and fiberglass replicas of the nuclear
test site. For the masses, they are symbols of national glory and
achievement, not death and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear ignorance is almost total, extending even to the educated.
Some students at the university in Islamabad where I teach said, when
asked, that a nuclear war would be the end of the world. Others
thought of nukes as just bigger bombs. Many said it was not their
concern, but the army's. Almost none knew about the possibility of a
nuclear firestorm, about residual radioactivity or damage to the gene
pool.</TE>
<TE>   Because nuclear war is considered a distant abstraction, civil
defense in both countries is nonexistent. Indian Adm. L. Ramdas, now
retired and a leading peace activist, caustically remarked: "There
are no air raid shelters in this city of Delhi, because in this
country people are considered expendable." Islamabad's civil defense
budget is a laughable $40,000, and the current year's allocation has
yet to be disbursed. No serious contingency plans have been devised,
plans that might save millions of lives by providing timely
information about things like escape routes, iodine tablets and
sources of nonradioactive food and drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   Ignorance and its attendant lack of fear make it easier for
leaders to treat their people as pawns in a mad nuclear game. How
else to explain Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's recent
exhortations to his troops in Kashmir to prepare for "decisive
victory"? His nuclear brinkmanship has been made possible by
influential Indian experts seeking to trivialize Pakistan's nuclear
capability. Such analysts have gained wide currency--they offer
instant security to all who choose to believe them.</TE>
<TE>   The reasoning of the "trivialization school" goes as follows:
Pakistan is a client state of the U.S., and Pakistani nuclear weapons
are under the control of Washington. Hence, in an extreme crisis, the
U.S. would either prohibit their use by Pakistan or, if need be,
destroy them. At a recent meeting this January in Dubai, I heard
senior Indian analysts say that they are "bored" with Pakistan's
nuclear threats and no longer believe them. K. Subrahmanyam, an
influential Indian hawk who has advocated overt Indian nuclearization
for more than a decade, believes that India can "sleep in peace."</TE>
<TE>   Indian denial of Pakistani capabilities is not a wholly new
phenomenon. Two months before the May 1998 nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan, as part of a delegation from Pugwash, an international
organization of scientists concerned about nuclear war, I met with
India's then-Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral in Delhi. In response
to my expressed worries about a nuclear catastrophe on the
subcontinent, he repeatedly assured me--both in public and
privately--that Pakistan did not have the capability of making atomic
bombs. He was not alone in his thinking. Senior Indian defense
analysts like P.R. Chari had also published articles before May 1998
arguing this point, as had the former head of the Indian Atomic
Energy Agency, Raja Ramana.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan proved the doubters wrong. Forced out of the closet by
the Indian tests, Pakistan's nuclear weapons gave the country a false
sense of confidence and security. This encouraged it to launch its
secret war in the Kargil area of Kashmir. In fact, this war will be
recorded by historians as the first that was initiated by nuclear
weapons. Although India wanted to respond, the existence of
Pakistan's deterrence sharply limited its options.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In a global climate deeply hostile to Islamic militancy, new
possibilities opened up to India. Seeking to settle scores with
Pakistan, India now began to seriously consider cross-border strikes
on militant camps on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control in
Kashmir. To sell this to the Indian public, denying the potency of
Pakistan's nuclear weapons became essential.</TE>
<TE>   But to fearlessly challenge a nuclear Pakistan requires a denial
of reality. It is an enormous leap of faith to presume that the U.S.
has the will--or even the ability--to destroy Pakistani nukes.
Tracking and destroying even a handful of mobile, nuclear-armed
missiles is no easy feat.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, even though the U.S. Air
Force had aerial photos of the missile locations and its planes were
only minutes away, it reportedly could not ensure more than 90%
effectiveness in a surprise attack against the Soviet missiles on the
island. More recently, in Iraq, U.S. efforts to destroy Iraqi Scuds
had limited success. There is no precedent for a country trying to
destroy another's nuclear bombs. This would be fantastically
dangerous because one needs 100% success--a remaining nuke could
unleash catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Fight or flight? Biological evolution has programmed us for two
elemental responses to external threats. Without fear there is no
flight, just fight. The brave are doomed. Ignorant and fearless,
India and Pakistan could well add a new chapter to well-worn
textbooks on the theory of nuclear deterrence.</TE>

<HD>The Best Way to Bust Up L.A.</HD>
<DH>The boroughs would have real power, with control over
basic city services. L.A.'s government structure was brilliantly
designed for a different era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL KOTKIN and FRED SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at
Pepperdine and at the Milken Institute. Fred Siegel is a historian at
the Cooper Union for Science and Art in New York City. Both were
consultants to the Hertzberg plan.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The months leading up to the Nov. 5 election don't bode well for Los
Angeles. The bruising battle over Valley and Hollywood secession will
probably inflame the city's existing racial, class and ideological
divisions. Likely to be overlooked in such a debate is the central
question undergirding the secessionist impulse--the quality of
governance in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles' government has a reputation as one of the least
efficient and most expensive in the nation. The city ranks at or near
the bottom in virtually every cost category, from services to the
cost of doing business here, according to the Kosmont Cost of Doing
Business Survey and the Reason Foundation. The city also suffers from
a lack of political trust and from a low rate of political
participation. A recent study of "civic capital" in 40 U.S. cities by
Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam found that Los Angeles
ranked near the bottom when it came to trusting other people and
civic engagement.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, neither side in the secession battle has a plan to
deal with these failures. The anti-secession side seems committed to
scare tactics, while secession advocates have not made a convincing
case for a new city other than to cite the failures of the old. To
save Los Angeles in the long term, the city needs to find ways to
make its governance more local, less bureaucratic and more reflective
of the diverse needs of its neighborhoods. In short, it needs a
framework for a new, more flexible system of governance.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Democrat who
represented Sherman Oaks, has worked out the basic outlines of such a
system. In essence, his plan would jettison the City Council
framework and replace it with a borough system. Each of the nine
boroughs in the Hertzberg plan would serve as a kind of local
municipality. The boundaries of the boroughs would be drawn to keep
communities of geographic interest together. For example, Van Nuys,
which the new Valley city would break up into several districts,
would be kept whole in a proposed mid-Valley borough.</TE>
<TE>   The boroughs would have real power, with control over such basic
city services as housing, community development, parks, recreation
and cultural affairs. A five-member council elected from districts of
roughly 82,000--a size amenable to grass-roots campaigns--would run
each borough. The representatives would be part-time legislators, a
feature that would open the door to citizen-politicians. Local
residents could call on their own "little city hall" to deal with
their problems. People from Watts, San Pedro or Granada Hills would
no longer have to trek downtown in search of basic services.</TE>
<TE>   Critical services best controlled from downtown--police, fire,
water, ports, airports and final zoning authority--would be handled
by a council of borough presidents made up of the nine borough
presidents. The council would be a forum for balancing local and
citywide interests. The mayor would retain his expanded executive
authority under the recently adopted charter. The proposed council
differs from the current system in that each borough president would
be someone with responsibility and operational control of a district.
In other words, accountability would be introduced into the system.</TE>
<TE>   Those who believe that only elites should hold power will resist
Hertzberg's call for the diffusion of city government power. Those
living off the current dysfunctional system--political consultants,
some union officials, well-connected developers, to name a few--will
find Hertzberg's plan equally noxious. So, too, will some die-hard
secessionists, whose primary motivation often seems more about
"getting even" than about creating a better and more responsive
government.</TE>
<TE>   Others will claim that Hertzberg's approach is too radical, too
untested. Yes, the plan calls for a sharp departure from the status
quo. Yet other great cities have adopted similar borough systems. In
London, which did not have a central government until recently, local
services have long been successfully provided on a borough basis. In
New York City, quality-of-life services, such as garbage collection
and street repairs, were most reliably delivered when the city had a
strong, functioning borough system. Furthermore, the city's recent
revival owed much to the decentralization of its parks, sanitation
and business services.</TE>
<TE>   New York City's borough system has atrophied over the years, no
longer providing the strong sense of local civic identity that once
knit together polyglot populations. Manhattan's overweening
power--economic, cultural and political--is partly to blame. In the
face of that dominance, borough governance was scaled back.</TE>
<TE>   True, Hertzberg's plan faces an uphill battle to make it on the
November ballot. Given the time constraints, only the City Council
can add the proposal to the ballot. The question, then, is whether
the council would contribute to its own possible demise. But Los
Angeles, with its polycentric economy, is ideal for a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Hertzberg plan probably will contend that it
flies in the face of the political traditions and folkways of Los
Angeles. Such an argument, however, underestimates both the degree of
change in the city during the last 100 years and L.A.'s reputation as
a first-class innovator in government.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' governmental structure was brilliantly designed--for
a different era. Nonpartisan commissions, sophisticated use of
zoning, adoption of economies of scale to develop more efficient
services, all worked reasonably well as late as the 1970s. Borough
proposals, dating back to 1906, were periodically floated in response
to the city's geographic and population growth, but as long as the
progressive-era system worked, there was little incentive to change
it.</TE>
<TE>   But today's dispersed post-industrial economy, and the city's
far-reaching diversity, make the centralized councilmanic system a
barrier to future success. For one thing, the need for
centralization, as many in the private sector have long recognized,
has been reduced by the digital revolution, which allows for
information to be shared and accessed as never before. Local boroughs
do not need large cadres of clerks and professional interveners to
develop their databases or reach educated decisions; most of the
needed information, and processing tools, exist on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the progressive system was designed for a city that was, for
the most part, dominated by middle-class Anglo Protestants, largely
from the Midwest. The assumption was that uniform systems and
approaches would work citywide, since most people shared the same
cultural inclinations. This is no longer true in Los Angeles, where
not only race but also cultural sensibilities, desire for urban
amenities and interest in density vary from section to section.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the borough system rests on the building block of Los
Angeles that works for most Angelenos--their neighborhoods. In
surveys, Angelenos usually express satisfaction with their
neighborhoods even while feeling ambivalent, or worse, about the city
as a whole. Each of us identifies with the issues we face in our
communities. Whether it's mothers in East Los Angeles fighting to
improve their children's education, or senior citizens in Woodland
Hills lobbying for a traffic light, the energy of this city draws on
our sense of place and connection to where we shop, where our
children play, where we worship and where we find everyday meaning in
our lives. Hertzberg's borough plan strives to capture the vibrancy
of our communities and translate it into a system of governance.</TE>
<TE>   The larger notion of Los Angeles--with all its symbolism--can best
be built on a bedrock of local governance. The Hertzberg plan
provides that bedrock.</TE>

<KH>TERRORISM</KH>
<HD>Domestic Spying Catches No One</HD>
<DH>All this snooping never uncovered any plot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER H. PYLE</AU>
<BD>Christopher H. Pyle, who teaches civil liberties at
Mount Holyoke College, is the author of "Military Surveillance of
Civilian Politics, 1967-1970."</BD>
<DL>SOUTH HADLEY, Mass.</DL>
<LD>It all seems so innocent. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft wants to unleash
the FBI to surf the Web for possible terrorists. And it could be,
except for the insidious fact that each time politicians have
"unleashed" an investigative agency, even for the best of reasons,
bad things have happened without improving security.</LD>
<LD>   In 1970, I wrote an article about the Army's surveillance of civil
rights and anti-war movements. Its domestic-spying program employed
1,500 agents and was undertaken without authority from Congress, the
president or even the secretary of the Army. My name was soon added
to President Nixon's "enemies list" for a tax audit. The Army tried
to monitor my incoming mail. Shortly before I was to testify before
North Carolina Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr.'s subcommittee on constitutional
rights, Army colonels falsely informed committee staffers that I had
fathered illegitimate children.</LD>
<LD>   It was the stuff of intimidation--and it worked most of the time.
Many former FBI agents said they would only provide information to
the Senate subcommittee if their identities were not disclosed; few
dared testify in public.</LD>
<TE>   In 1972, I was hired by Ervin's committee to analyze the
information, stored on six computers, that the Army had obtained from
its domestic political spying. The files showed that the Army had
clearly violated the privacy and free-speech rights of hundreds of
thousands of law-abiding Americans. But they also revealed how
useless the spying had been--not one report pointed to any foreign or
criminal involvement in domestic political protests.</TE>
<TE>   Other domestic-spying programs have been similarly fruitless. In
the 1950s and 1960s, the FBI, the Army, the CIA and many police
department "red squads" clipped newspapers and attended public
meetings with the aim of identifying people sympathetic to
communists. Their agents also infiltrated many law-abiding groups in
search of "reds" or fellow travelers. The Army, whose only domestic
duty was to put down riots, eventually spied on every demonstration
of 20 people or more. But all this snooping never predicted a riot or
uncovered any plot, communist or otherwise, to turn a lawful protest
into a criminal attack.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, the FBI undertook more than 500,000
counterintelligence investigations against domestic political groups.
Not one produced an indictment. Yet the investigations gradually
changed the character of the agency, from one chiefly concerned with
law enforcement to one centered on spying.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, the more the FBI thought of itself as an intelligence
agency, the less it felt restrained by law. Without a statutory
charter, Justice Department guidelines or meaningful legislative
oversight, the bureau conducted thousands of burglaries, called
"black bag" jobs, and opened hundreds of thousands of first-class
letters. It also bugged, without warrants, people not suspected of
any crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon's secret plan, hatched in late 1970, to use the FBI, Army
and CIA to spy on critics of the Vietnam War ultimately contributed
to his downfall, sent his attorney general to prison and persuaded
the FBI to adopt the very guidelines that Ashcroft now finds
"outdated" in the war against terrorism. But without those
guidelines, harassment and dirty tricks are likely to be acceptable
again as long as they are directed against suspected terrorists and
their sympathizers and as long as the Bush administration can
plausibly deny authorizing them.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that would be OK if the spying helps protect us from
terrorists. But the opposite is more likely to occur. The
investigations Ashcroft envisions are almost certain to inundate
analysts with so much irrelevant information that they won't be able
to separate meaningful signals from the static.</TE>
<TE>   Whether there was a significant intelligence failure leading up to
Sept. 11 remains to be seen. If there was one, however, it probably
resembled the failure that left Pearl Harbor unguarded Dec. 7, 1941:
the inability to collate and analyze useful signals from many sources
in time to prevent a surprise attack. One of the great benefits of
the "outdated" FBI guidelines was that they protected the bureau from
wasting limited resources vacuuming up domestic political trivia.
Good intelligence work, like good sleuthing, requires a disciplined,
focused, well-coordinated exploitation of promising leads.</TE>
<TE>   The war against Al Qaeda will not be won at home. Mohamed Atta,
the director of the Sept. 11 attacks, didn't reveal his plans in an
Internet chat room. So, instead of unleashing FBI agents to spy on
Middle Easterners in the United States, the government should hire
hundreds of foreign-born linguists on a contract basis and send them
off to track down leads in Pakistan, Indonesia or Kashmir. Other
linguists should be hired to analyze the results, much as we used
Japanese Americans to read Japanese code traffic during World War II.
And most of these linguists should not be integrated into existing
agencies. They should be assigned to new units free of the usual
bureaucratic impediments to curiosity, imagination and initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Would such measures prevent another terrorist attack in the United
States? Probably not, but they will do more good and less harm than
assigning English-only white guys to hang around New Jersey mosques
or to monitor chat lines in Peoria.</TE>

<HD>Slouching Toward Annihilation</HD>
<DH>The war against terrorism has radically altered the
India-Pakistan dynamic-- and not for the better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AHMED RASHID</AU>
<BD>Ahmed Rashid is the author of "Jihad: The Rise of
Militant Islam in Central Asia."</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Despite the continuing shuttle diplomacy that aims to defuse tensions
between India and Pakistan, it's not difficult to imagine how war on
the Indian subcontinent would begin--and, more frightening, how it
would end.</LD>
<LD>   India might launch punitive airstrikes and commando raids on the
camps of Kashmiri and Pakistani militants based in Azad, or Pakistani
Kashmir. Pakistan, in turn, could retaliate, hitting army bases in
Indian Kashmir. After weeks of fighting, with neither side able to
claim an advantage in the mountainous terrain despite raids and
counter-raids across the disputed Line of Control, one side might
attempt to break the logjam by crossing the international border and
invading the other. Or India's navy might blockade Pakistan's only
artery to the outside world, the port of Karachi.</LD>
<LD>   India's huge advantage in soldiers and armor would quickly win it
territory, which could force a desperate Pakistani military to use
tactical nuclear weapons on concentrations of Indian forces. The
world's first nuclear war could begin as easily as this.</LD>
<TE>   The two countries' 55-year-old dispute over Kashmir, a legacy of
the partition of British India in 1947, has led to two wars, many
crises, military mobilizations, threats and counter-threats. This
history has lulled the international community into believing that
the current crisis is just a repeat of the previous shadow dances. In
truth, never has the situation been so fraught with danger.</TE>
<TE>   The radical new element in this crisis has nothing to do with the
territorial dispute over Kashmir. Rather, it is the post-Sept. 11
world and the international war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   India is furious that the world has ignored Pakistan-based Islamic
extremists who have continued to stage bloody acts of terrorism in
India and Kashmir since Sept. 11. New Delhi says it cannot join the
world in fighting Al Qaeda when the world pays no attention to these
attacks on its soil. At the same time, India believes that it can
continue to ignore the plight of the Kashmiri people, who have
suffered more than 40,000 dead over the last 13 years of conflict. It
is using the global war on terrorism to further push back any serious
dialogue with the Kashmiris and a possible resolution to a conflict
with its own people.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's military regime believed that it could comfortably
carry out a policy U-turn: drop its support for the Taliban and join
the U.S. alliance to topple the Taliban and the world and India would
look the other way while it backed Kashmiri and Pakistani militants,
who have turned the Kashmiris' genuine political struggle for
self-determination into a jihad. The Pakistani army's refusal to
understand how much the world had changed after Sept. 11, coupled
with its failure to articulate a new strategy that would enhance the
political struggle in Kashmir, rather than militancy and terrorism,
gave India the opportunity it sought to finally deal with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf divides militants into three
camps: Al Qaeda and the Taliban; the sectarian extremists inside his
country who have butchered thousands of innocent Pakistanis; and the
"freedom fighters" of Kashmir. The world now tells him that there are
no such distinctions. This reality should have been clearer much
earlier. The Pakistani militant groups that fight in Kashmir also
fought for the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The 29 Arab Al Qaeda operatives arrested in Pakistani last month
were given sanctuary by the largest Pakistani group fighting in
Kashmir. The fact is, all these groups are now closely interlinked,
no matter how hard the Pakistani state strains to differentiate them.</TE>
<TE>   Its military's poor tactics have turned the entire world against
Pakistan, although the real victims are the poor, hapless people of
Kashmir, whose political struggle is now equated with terrorism. By
serendipity, India has won the international community to its side
and isolated Pakistan, but that has not made it more amenable to
reducing tensions because for many Indians there is a wider agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-line Hindu fundamentalist wing of India's ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party has long contended Pakistan has to be beaten
militarily so it will never again rise to question India's hegemony
in South Asia. For these hard-liners, the issue is not merely
terrorism: It is also beating Pakistan into final submission.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, moderate Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
has twice taken major initiatives to talk to Pakistan. His failure
has strengthened the Hindu fundamentalist wing. The BJP's recent
electoral defeats in regional elections and the killing of some 1,000
people--mostly Muslim--in Gujarat state by Hindu fundamentalists have
further weakened Vajpayee's influence on the power brokers in New
Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf also is on the ropes. Last month's rigged referendum
that made him president for the next five years, the fear of another
rigged general election in October and the army's unwillingness to
share real power with civilians have turned the country's major
political parties against him and continued army rule. For the first
time in Pakistan's history, and despite the experience of three wars
with India, Pakistanis are not rallying around the army to defend the
motherland. They are instead demanding Musharraf's resignation. The
sad logic of many ordinary people in both countries is that Musharraf
and the BJP would prefer a diversion, such as a limited war, rather
than the continued weakening of their domestic political positions.
Neither side sees the logic of backing off their brinkmanship. So
enormous is the lack of communication between the two countries that
anything could spark a conflict--a missile test gone wrong, another
terrorist attack like that carried out on India's parliament or a
macho junior officer on the Line of Control wanting to teach his
adversary a lesson. The need for international intervention in the
dispute has never been greater, not just to prevent a war but to
force the two sides to finally resolve the Kashmir dispute. It was
the direct intervention of then-President Clinton that finally ended
the Kargil Heights crisis in 1999, when he called Pakistan's
then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   It will now take the direct intervention of President Bush, not
his aides, to end this conflict. Bush needs to call the Indian and
Pakistani leadership to Washington, meet with them in a neutral third
country or travel to the region himself. Nothing else will
de-escalate the tension.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Role for America: The World's Top Cop</HD>
<DH>Democracy won, the president is saying to our enemies. You
got a problem with that?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a political analyst for CNN.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Don't call President Bush an isolationist. Some people were tempted
to do that during the 2000 campaign, when the Republican candidate
criticized Bill Clinton for overextending American commitments and
turning the U.S. into "the world's policeman."</LD>
<LD>   In his commencement address June 1 at West Point, the president
gave a major foreign-policy speech that extended Washington's
commitments and defined a U.S. role in the world that sounds an awful
lot like police work. "We must uncover terror cells in 60 or more
countries, using every tool of finance, intelligence and law
enforcement," he told the graduating class.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Bush described a far bigger vision than Clinton's. "All
nations that decide for aggression and terror will pay a price," the
president said. "We will not leave the safety of America and the
peace of the planet at the mercy of a few mad terrorists and
tyrants."</LD>
<TE>   Bush's speech sounded a lot like President Harry S. Truman's
address to Congress on March 12, 1947, when Truman said: "I believe
that it must be the policy of the United States to support free
peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities
or by outside pressures." Truman's speech defined the Truman Doctrine
that guided U.S. foreign policy for more than four decades. Bush
aimed to do no less in his address last week. He laid out the Bush
Doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Truman's speech was occasioned by an immediate crisis. In the
aftermath of World War II, Eastern Europe had come under Soviet
domination. Greece and Turkey were in imminent danger of falling to
communist subversion.</TE>
<TE>   Truman went before Congress to request $400 million in economic
and military assistance for the two countries. Truman added: "I am
fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United States
extends assistance to Greece and Turkey." Henceforth, the U.S. would
assume the burden of leading the free world in a global confrontation
with communism. It was a decisive break with the historic pattern of
American isolationism. A policy of endless, shadowy confrontation
with no prospect of victory in the foreseeable future. The Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Many doubted the American people would support such a policy.
Americans like short wars with clear-cut victories, not long,
twilight struggles. But the public confounded the political experts
and saw the Cold War through to the end--44 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, the president called for the most dramatic
reorganization of government since 1947. That year, the U.S. found
itself poorly organized to fight the Cold War. The result was the
National Security Act of 1947, a monumental piece of legislation that
created institutions that guided the U.S. through the Cold War: the
Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National
Security Council. Like the Cold War, the war on terror is a long-term
commitment. And a fundamental departure from past policy. Just as in
1947, government has to be reorganized to fight another endless,
shadowy confrontation with no prospect of victory in the foreseeable
future.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's West Point speech was heard in Washington as an elaborate,
coded justification for a U.S. strike against Saddam Hussein. Coded?
The president never mentioned Iraq, though the implication was clear
when he said: "The gravest danger to freedom lies at the perilous
crossroads of radicalism and technology."</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a predicate for an attack on Iraq," Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the next day. Possibly, although the
president continues to insist that "no plans" for such an attack are
on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Was Bush simply trying to dramatize his case against Iraq by
dressing it up in grandiose rhetoric? More likely, he was trying to
generalize from Iraq to make the case for a broader U.S. mission.
Just as Truman did with Greece and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   What is that mission?</TE>
<TE>   It is nothing less than the defense of civilization against
barbarism. "More and more, civilized nations find ourselves on the
same side, united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos,"
Bush said. Who's on Bush's list of "civilized nations"? "The United
States, Japan and our Pacific friends, and now all of Europe" made
the list. But so did "a new Russia ... our partner in the war against
terror." And potentially China, whose "leaders are discovering that
economic freedom is the only lasting source of national wealth." And
who, in time, the president said, "will find that social and
political freedom is the only true source of national greatness."</TE>
<TE>   Who's on the other side? The Islamic world? The president
repudiated that idea. "There is no clash of civilizations," he said.
"The peoples of the Islamic nations want and deserve the same freedom
and opportunities as people in every nation."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side are terrorists and rogue nations whose aim is to
throw the civilized world into chaos. Individuals and regimes with
evil intentions, not cultures. Many people suspect one reason Bush
put North Korea on the "axis of evil," alongside Iraq and Iran, was
to keep the list from being exclusively Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't Bush arguing for the superiority of our values over those of
others? Yes. Clearly and nondefensively. No post-modernist relativism
here. "The 20th century ended with a single surviving model of human
progress," Bush said. One based on "nonnegotiable demands of human
dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, respect
for women and private property and free speech and equal justice and
religious tolerance." Democracy won, Bush is saying to our enemies.
You got a problem with that?</TE>
<TE>   An alliance of the world's great powers looks very much like an
alliance to preserve the status quo. That is, after all, why radicals
hate us. They see the United States as the world's pre-eminent
status-quo power. The U.S. fought wars to reverse acts of aggression
and restore the status quo in Kuwait and Kosovo. If you desperately
want to change the status quo--as, say, the Palestinians do--then the
U.S. is not your ally.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Bush had something new to say. He argued that the
U.S. cannot be a status-quo power. It has to position itself as a
source of change and hope in the world. "America stands for more than
the absence of war," the president said. "We have a great opportunity
to extend a just peace by replacing poverty, repression and
resentment around the world with hope of a better day." Compassionate
internationalism!</TE>
<TE>   In one respect, the Bush Doctrine goes way beyond the Cold War.
And that's where it gets controversial. Bush explicitly rejected the
Cold War policies of deterrence and containment. Too passive. "We
must take the battle to the enemy," the president said, "disrupt his
plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge."</TE>
<TE>   Before they emerge? Yes. Because the alternative is too dangerous.
If Iraq is acquiring weapons of mass destruction and has expressed
the intention of using them, do we just stand by and wait for Hussein
to commit an atrocity? Do we go after terrorists before they commit a
crime, or do we wait for another Sept. 11? Bush ordered the future
Army leaders at West Point "to be ready for preemptive action when
necessary.' Just like the FBI is now supposed to go after "threats,"
before any crimes are committed.</TE>
<TE>   Will Americans support the Bush Doctrine? Rhetorically they will,
as long as the country feels threatened. But there is not a lot of
pressure on the administration to match the rhetoric with action,
except from conservatives. The idea of preemptive strikes makes most
Americans nervous. Remember, the Cold War became unpopular when it
turned into a hot war, in Korea and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "In the world we have entered," the president said June 1, "the
only path to safety is the path of action. And this nation will act."
In the case of the Truman Doctrine, the test came in Greece and
Turkey. They were saved. In the case of the Bush Doctrine, Iraq is
shaping up as the crucial test. Bush has to show the world that he's
not bluffing.</TE>

<HD>Crossing Over the Fowl Line</HD>
<DH>Just between us chickens, what are the rules?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't smirk. Empathize. Walk in the other fellow's shoes a while.
Look at things from someone else's perspective.</LD>
<LD>   OK, I'm trying now. I've got myself in a suit and tie and a
Washington frame of mind. I'm imagining now what it's like to plunge
into the fight over a once-teensy and much-mocked little industry
that sprouted from hippies and has now gone mainstream. It's organic
foods. No grinning, because pound for pound this industry is growing
faster than the technology racket.</LD>
<LD>   At least one purveyor has zoomed from practically zero to more
than $100 million in a year, capitalizing on the public's appetite
for wholesome nutrition. And overall, sales of organic foods have
grown an average of 23% a year over the last 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   But there is a problem: The country hasn't been able to agree on
what organic means.</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, the federal government has spent 12 years
dickering about it. We've had false starts, public outcries and
bureaucratic foot-dragging. But now, belatedly, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture is on track to clarify matters. Organic farmers want
it. Consumers demand it. Common sense insists upon it.</TE>
<TE>   So beginning Oct. 21, meat and dairy products can be labeled as
organic only if the animals are fed 100% organically produced and
genetically unaltered feeds, and no supplemental antibiotics or
hormones. Organically raised animals cannot be fed animal parts or
manure.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, any one of us could have saved them 11 years and 11 months to
come up with this definition, but empathize. This is Washington.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Same thing: This is Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is ever quite as it seems. This is where 12 years' work
comes down to the 12th hour and just a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   We're talking about carving loopholes in standards that haven't
even taken effect.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Melinda Fulmer recently disclosed that an
influential chicken company in Georgia wants to cash in on the
organic craze but cannot exactly meet the test. It's hard to find
organic chicken feed, you see. And it doesn't cost chicken feed to
buy it either. So Fieldale Farms has asked the government for a
"waiver." It would like to sell perhaps up to 300,000 chickens a
week, calling them organically raised when they are not.</TE>
<TE>   The perspective on this is pretty simple: If a consumer is willing
to pay, say, twice as much for an organic chicken, a fellow could
drive profits right through the old coop roof if his only cost was to
change the labels.</TE>
<TE>   In California and scattered other states that have set up their
own patchwork standards for organic food, the results would be even
greater confusion. Consumers in these states would see their local
regulations superceded by the new federal standards, and suddenly
non-organic chickens would show up on the shelves proudly labeled
organic.</TE>
<TE>   Don't smirk. This is why lobbyists live so well.</TE>
<TE>   The office of Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman says it will
consider the loophole request just the same as it considers all
requests, because government cannot close the door on people, chicken
farmers included.</TE>
<TE>   But a deputy said that doesn't mean Veneman will really consider
it, as in make a decision now or anytime. "There is nothing on her
desk," the deputy explained. And besides, Congress just ordered up a
study of the availability of organic feed, and who knows what that
means. Veneman's aide couldn't say. Unfortunately for Veneman,
another underling had already put things in writing a little
differently. In a letter to the Georgia chicken grower, the second
deputy allowed that situations may arise "where there is
justification for a change in the national standards to help the
market perform more efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Efficiently? Where did that word come from? The new standards for
organic food make no mention of efficiency as far as I can see.
Organic agriculture is by its nature inefficient. But remember, we
are not in Kansas anymore, Toto.</TE>
<TE>   It's an old story. You could look back at our securities laws.
Originally written in common-sense language to protect investors,
they have been hollowed out by decades of wheedling by lawyers and
lobbyists and provincial members of Congress. Today, almost anything
short of outright embezzlement lays in a vast area of regulatory
gray.</TE>
<TE>   No thanks. I tried on the shoes. There's a barnyard smell to them.</TE>

<AU>DENNIS M. CLAUSEN</AU>
<BD>Dennis M. Clausen is a professor of American literature
at the University of San Diego and author of "Prairie Son" (Mid-List
Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After my parents were divorced in the early 1950s, my mother, three
sisters, brother and I moved into an old farmhouse that had been
placed on top of concrete blocks on the edge of a small Midwestern
town. In the winter, there was no way to keep the cold from pouring
into the uninsulated walls and the pitted, cracked linoleum floors.</LD>
<LD>   Mom could not work; a childhood disease had destroyed her right
hip joint. We lived on what Dad could send in child support. When his
check arrived, we paid our rent. Then we concentrated on how we would
feed ourselves and pay the utilities. Clothing was hand-me-downs from
other families.</LD>
<LD>   My brother and I planted a garden to supplement our food supply
and roamed the countryside looking for wild rhubarb, asparagus and
raspberries. We tramped through the ditches outside of town,
searching for empty pop bottles that could be turned in for refunds.
A paper route brought in an extra dollar or two every week. Doctor?
Dentist? Out of the question. In spite of our best efforts, we could
not make ends meet.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, someone from the welfare department came to interview us.
Within days, we received a letter that said we would receive $30
every month. That money was often the difference between eating and
not eating.</TE>
<TE>   One cold winter day, an elderly farmer who worked as a volunteer
for the welfare department brought a box of groceries over to our
house. As he placed it on our kitchen table, he said: "All of us need
a helping hand at one time or another. Someday, it will be your turn
to help others." I sensed that he was trying to protect our dignity
as we accepted his charity.</TE>
<TE>   As the national rhetoric about the poor grows increasingly cruel
and mean-spirited--and the wealthiest Americans have more money than
ever before--I remember the humiliation and painful loss of pride I
felt when our family had to go on welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the same politicians who vote against welfare
assistance for the poor often support billions of dollars in tax
breaks and other corporate welfare for the wealthy. So I am bothered
by the mean-spiritedness of these attacks on the nation's truly needy
and by the callousness of those who have never experienced poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, I am bothered by the pejorative labels and
caricatures that strip the poor and their children of dignity as they
struggle to survive. Given a better and more just world, most people
would be gainfully employed and self-supporting. Illnesses,
accidents, lost jobs, economic downturns and deaths often rob people
of their means of support. For these poor, welfare is not "a black
hole," as some have labeled it, but rather an investment in our
nation's future.</TE>
<TE>   My evidence is personal and anecdotal, but here is what welfare
assistance did for our family: Virtually all of my mother's children
and grandchildren have graduated from college. They include a college
professor, a social worker who was instrumental in helping develop
the Minnesota Battered Women and Abused Children Organization, a
personnel director for a wholesale distribution company, several
successful self-employed businesspeople, a North Dakota teacher of
the year, a family-practice nurse practitioner, a real estate agent,
a registered nurse, a paralegal and a computer programmer.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare assistance we received in the 1950s was an investment
in our family's future. We have repaid that investment many times
over with our own tax money and commitment to our communities. If he
were still alive, that old farmer who survived the Great Depression
could teach Congress something about real welfare reform.</TE>

<HD>Petty Politics May Cost the Rest of Us a World-Class City</HD>
<DH>Self-interested City Hall ploys play into secessionist
hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the secessionists who want to break Los Angeles into several
smaller cities are eventually successful, then what happened last
week could prove pivotal in their campaign.</LD>
<LD>   I am not referring to the official approval for Hollywood to join
the San Fernando Valley in holding a secession election in November.</LD>
<LD>   That is no small matter, to be sure. There will now be two
organized campaigns in two parts of the city working to persuade
voters in the Valley and Hollywood to break away, and voters in the
rest of town to let them go. But everyone could see the Hollywood
vote coming once the Local Agency Formation Commission concluded two
weeks ago that Hollywood could pay its bills if it were to become a
city.</LD>
<TE>   That is why it was so infuriating to see that even as the vote
affirming LAFCO's study of Hollywood's finances was looming, the
powers that be at City Hall, encouraged by some powerful downtown
political activists, continued to go blithely about their
self-centered business as if secession were an annoyance rather than
a real possibility.</TE>
<TE>   I refer to the continued jockeying among Los Angeles City Council
members Jan Perry, Nick Pacheco, Ed Reyes, Mark Ridley-Thomas and
Nate Holden over how council districts will be drawn in and around
Los Angeles' central core. They squabbled like kids in a sandbox last
week, with a final council vote on redistricting scheduled for
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have forgotten, some months ago a citizens'
commission presented members of the City Council with new maps for 15
districts based on population changes found in the 2000 census. The
commission did so under a provision of the new City Charter that was
intended to minimize the influence of personal political ambitions or
rivalries on the redistricting process.</TE>
<TE>   The citizens' commission came up with maps that could be faulted
as politically correct--they were drawn to minimize any potential
conflicts between African American and Latino council candidates, for
instance. But they also took into account the strong secession
sentiment in the Valley by putting five full council districts there.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, a reasonable compromise worked out by citizens with no
vested interest in who's up or who's down in City Hall.
Unfortunately, a handful of council members with districts near
downtown could not leave well enough alone and started tweaking the
lines to claim bits and pieces of expensive real estate from rookie
Councilwoman Perry, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   Normally these petty internal maneuverings might have been kept
inside City Hall. But some movers and shakers who seem to consider
downtown their personal bailiwick--among them Cardinal Roger Mahony,
businessman and arts patron Eli Broad and Staples Center developer Ed
Roski--started a heavy-handed campaign in support of "their"
councilwoman, insisting that downtown must remain in one district.</TE>
<TE>   Where were these guys when Van Nuys was divided among five
districts the last time the City Council map was redrawn?</TE>
<TE>   I'm not equating Van Nuys with downtown because any such
comparison is obviously apples versus oranges. But how about the
hypocrisy of powerful guys who can get a phone call back from anyone
in town whining about the fact that they might have to deal with two
or three council members rather than just one? It just breaks your
heart, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I don't give two hoots who represents downtown.</TE>
<TE>   But I do think it would be nice if the city of Los Angeles were to
remain reasonably whole. And the more Perry and other council members
squabble over a few blocks downtown, the more residents of the Valley
and Hollywood--and just maybe other parts of town someday--will
conclude the secessionists are right, and further, that the denizens
of City Hall really don't care what the average Angeleno wants.</TE>
<TE>   And if voters carry that attitude to the polls in November, you
can kiss the City of Angels, as we have known it, goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   And then where will Mahony, Broad, Roski and the like be, without
a "world class" city to lord over?</TE>

<HD>Will Ballots or Bullets Rule?</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan's fate hinges on the outcome of this week's
loya jirga.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. ALEXANDER THIER</AU>
<BD>J. Alexander Thier is a consultant for the
International Crisis Group in Kabul and a former United Nations
official in Afghanistan.</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>One morning with Gen. Atiqullah Baryalai in the eastern province of
Logar, a few hours south of Kabul, provides more insight into what's
going on in Afghanistan than a month of meetings in the capital, with
its Land Cruiser traffic jams, international military patrols and
Starbucks.</LD>
<LD>   "Atiq," as he is called, and those like him stand in direct
contrast to the aspirations of the vast majority of Afghan people.
After 23 years of conflict, Afghans are getting ready to choose a new
government, one that they desperately hope will be beholden to the
people, not to the favorite weapon of the warlords, the Kalashnikov.</LD>
<LD>   A loya jirga, or grand assembly, is convening this week to choose
a transitional government. The hopes of most Afghans and the world at
large are singularly focused on the loya jirga; expectations are
unreasonably high.</LD>
<TE>   However, visions of a great leap forward are misplaced, and the
danger of misstep is serious. At best, change will be incremental; at
worst, if the outcome is rejected by key power-brokers, Afghanistan
could tumble back into the factionalist conflict of the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Atiq. He is a warlord, but not just any
warlord. The uniforms, his new satellite phone--one could even say
his confidence--have been provided by the U.S. military in exchange
for his help in hunting Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Atiq intends to go to the loya jirga. He even talks of being
president of Afghanistan. If he doesn't get what he wants, will he
cooperate with the new central government?</TE>
<TE>   The main expectation of most Afghans and of the international
community is that the loya jirga will produce a more balanced
government than the one created in Bonn last December, where the
United Nations coaxed the various Afghan factions into a six-month,
post-Taliban provisional administration. But this outcome is far from
assured.</TE>
<TE>   Intense power struggles are taking place at all levels to shape
and even subvert the outcome. Few results will satisfy all parties.
For example, there will probably be deep discontent among Pushtuns,
Afghanistan's largest ethnic group, with any result that excludes
former King Mohammad Zaher Shah and keeps the security ministries
(defense and interior) in the hands of the Panjshiri Tajiks who
control Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a strong role for the ex-king and a loss of key posts
may be unacceptable to the Panjshiris and key former Northern
Alliance constituencies. It's a potential collision course, one that
will take immense diplomatic pressure and compromise to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there's been almost no progress on strengthening the
central government. As the U.S. and the rest of the coalition battles
continue, there is little hope that local and regional commanders
will reduce their forces.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the opposite appears to be happening. Factional fighting
has recently erupted in the southeast, north, center and west of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Most Afghans have little recent experience with representative,
let alone democratic, institutions, and the legitimacy of the loya
jirga will be judged on the outcome rather than on the fairness of
the process itself.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has a critical role to play in deploying, in concert,
international diplomatic and military influence to help Afghans make
this crucial step forward. Intense diplomatic effort is needed to
establish a dialogue among disgruntled factions and to forge a common
vision of an acceptable, if not ideal, outcome for the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   But that must be accompanied by swift, definitive security steps
to nip factional fighting in the bud, lest a few small fires lead to
a conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   If the outcome of the loya jirga is fair, Atiq says he will accept
it. If not, the warlord lifestyle seems to be treating him fairly
well.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan people hope that the international community will
convince Atiq to accept the outcome, whether he likes it or not.</TE>

<LD>On June 1, one of public radio's most popular programs, Garrison
Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion," originated from the Greek
Theatre in Los Angeles. His show, as usual, was great, but Los
Angeles and the Greek Theatre were not.</LD>
<LD>   We were among the hundreds of guests who did not get into their
seats until well after the broadcast had begun (we missed 40 minutes
of the two-hour show). The tickets were expensive. We had left home
early to get there on time. Why didn't we? Because it took us an hour
and a half to drive just two miles in horrendous traffic from the 5
Freeway to the Greek Theatre via Los Feliz Boulevard and Hillhurst
Avenue. There were no accidents. There simply was no traffic
control--not an officer in sight--and a parking system that was
inefficient beyond belief.</LD>
<LD>   Keillor had large crowds for his programs in recent years in
Claremont and Pasadena. Those communities had no problem handling
traffic. What in the world is wrong with L.A. and the Greek Theatre?</LD>

<AU>DINA KHAYAT</AU>
<BD>Dina Khayat is managing director of Lazard Asset
Management Egypt and a member of the executive board of the Cairo
Peace Movement.</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>When I was a child in Cairo during the 1960s, we were taught
geography that showed maps of "Palestine" but made no mention of
Israel except as an aggressor and a ravager of Palestinian and,
therefore, Arab rights. As a puzzled 6-year-old I had to rely on
imagination alone to conjure up the image of an "enemy" talked about
everywhere, but one that I could not find anywhere on a map.</LD>
<LD>   We were hemmed in--not literally, but in a more enduring sense,
intellectually and culturally. That intellectual wall produced a
generation that grew up beside a faceless neighbor they profoundly
distrusted. And just like any introverted society, we failed to
develop, to learn from new ideas, instead just repeating over and
over our anachronistic mantras of anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism,
anti-imperialism. The result was an intellectual, economic, cultural
and spiritual void.</LD>
<LD>   It had not always been so. I come from a country that long thrived
as an open society. There have been Christians in Egypt since St.
Mark first came in AD 43; before Gamal Abdel Nasser took power in a
bloodless coup in 1952, there were Jews, Syro-Lebanese, Greeks and
Italians, all of whom contributed to a culturally rich and diverse
Egypt. When they were gone, Egypt was the poorer for their absence.</LD>
<TE>   Then came President Anwar Sadat. When he took that fateful trip to
Jerusalem in 1977, our collective anticipation, emotion and wonder
were as great as if his plane were landing on Mars. Suddenly our
prospects were brighter; the world was a potentially friendlier place
as he was asked (now famously) upon his arrival what took him so
long.</TE>
<TE>   In seemingly quick succession, there followed the Camp David
accords and the return of the Sinai, and with it, an influx of
Israeli tourists to Egypt. I remember a camping trip in Sharm el
Sheik in the late '80s when we saw as many cars with Israeli plates
as we did Egyptian cars. The Bedouins serving breakfast at the camp
were as fluent in Hebrew as they were in Arabic--and as comfortable
with one as with the other. This is how it should be, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   These are the images that colored my upbringing, my passing from a
gray childhood to a young adulthood full of promise. In 1993, the
Oslo accords promised more progress and hope. In 1995, I finally made
my own trip to Israel. I traveled from Washington, where I had held a
rewarding job but yearned for the Middle East in general and my Egypt
in particular. Eyes wide, I took in the sights of Mediterranean Tel
Aviv, the familiar whiff of sea, fish and falafel. I made friends
with whom I stay in regular touch today--friends I called immediately
from the U.S. to express grief and condolences after Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   My friends said Rabin's death was a devastating loss--but that the
extremists would never win. For a while it seemed they were right. We
were all on the right track, with increasing openness pointing toward
the articulation of a hitherto undreamed-of vision of regional
integration, peace and economic cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened to these dreams? What has the Middle East come
to?</TE>
<TE>   My own lofty ideas for participating in the "New Middle East" have
been put on hold by circumstances. The current violence is an
extremist's fantasy--and a horrible vindication for their destructive
impulses. After so many years of hope, it is shameful--and sad--that
the only ones in a position to say "I told you so" are the extremists
on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   I am not alone here: I know there are many of you out there, many
who watch with horror every day this seemingly unstoppable war, the
now daily verbal assault of extremism. We all cringe at the physical
and intellectual devastation that this tragic conflict will leave
behind.</TE>
<TE>   We have all lost in past decades. Lost the opportunity to get to
know each other, lost the chance to work together--to contribute to
each other's prosperity and sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in these bleak moments, all it would take is for us to
recognize that we share a common future. Let us work together to
reach a true resolution that will end the conflict permanently. Let
us think beyond the current crisis and imagine the future we want.
That's the only way we'll get it.</TE>

<HD>Landlords Urged to Tighten Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA BURTOFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of recent FBI warnings about terrorist threats at
apartment buildings, national organizations representing the rental
industry have sent their member landlords tips on improving security.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Culkin, executive vice president of the National Apartment
Assn., based in Alexandria, Va., said his group hopes to heighten
awareness for employees and residents so that anyone and anything
unusual will be reported to apartment-management offices and to
federal authorities.</LD>
<LD>   And Jay Harris, vice president of property management for the
Washington, D.C.-based National Multi Housing Council, which
represents owners of large groups of buildings, has provided
recommendations for apartment managers. Here's how the actions might
affect you:</LD>
<TE>   * Rental applications: If you are a student, you may be asked to
submit documentation from your college stating that you are attending
class full time. Management companies are concerned that if an
individual signs up for one course, even if he or she never goes to
class, and then obtains a rental unit, the address can be used to
prove that the individual has a U.S. residence.</TE>
<TE>   If you've been out of high school or college for a few years, the
list of previous landlords you provide is more likely than in the
past to be checked completely.</TE>
<TE>   If you are moving in with others but are not responsible for part
of the rent, you may still be expected to submit an application.</TE>
<TE>   * Outdoor parking lots: Additional surveillance may begin. Safety
patrol officers could be looking for cars that aren't usually in the
lot. Don't leave packages in your car that could be mistaken for
bombs.</TE>
<TE>   More lighting may be added. The downside is that it could be so
bright that you may need to purchase blackout linings to put behind
your apartment drapes.</TE>
<TE>   * Underground garages: Expect additional surveillance. If the door
is usually kept open during the day, you may find it is locked and
that you need a special key or card for entry.</TE>
<TE>   You may receive notice that ID stickers or tags must appear on
your car. You may be told about new procedures for towing
unidentifiable cars. That would apply to outdoor lots, too.</TE>
<TE>   * Entries: If the lobby has been open during the day, you may find
that it is now locked and that you are given a limited number of keys
that may not be copied. Some entry points to your building may be
closed.</TE>
<TE>   * Carts: Those left in the garage to assist residents taking
groceries to their units might be removed. Residents would need to
buy their own carts and store them in their cars. Luggage carts kept
in the lobby may be stored elsewhere; residents could be told that
only the doormen or porters can use them.</TE>
<TE>   * Package rooms: Residents could be asked to pick up deliveries
promptly, and attendants could be notified to return or discard
unclaimed items. If you will be traveling, ask a neighbor to pick up
packages for you.</TE>
<TE>   * Laundry rooms:  These areas may become accessible only by key.</TE>
<TE>   * Swimming pools: If there is an attendant or guard, you may be
asked to show a picture ID, especially if your building is near a
college. Students tend to leave town for the summer, and some will
sneak in subtenants. Sublets are allowed in some places but not all.</TE>
<TE>   The management office might not know those people are in the units
until the subletting tenants try to use the pool. If there is a
picture ID made by and registered in the office, it becomes a
safeguard--not only for pool use but also for the property.</TE>
<TE>   * Empty apartments: Staff members or safety patrol officers could
check apartments regularly to make sure they are secure and vacant.</TE>
<TE>   * Unattended areas: Storage rooms and areas where housecleaning
and maintenance supplies are stored could be declared off-limits to
all but identified residents, employees and other designated people.</TE>
<TE>   * Deliveries: Front-desk personnel may begin to require delivery
people to sign in, leave a picture ID and sign out. If you are
expecting food delivery, a prescription from the pharmacy,
dry-cleaners pickup, etc., you should mention the new rule when you
place an order.</TE>
<TE>   * Contractors and others entering the building through a loading
dock: Whether they are doing work on behalf of management or your
individual unit, they may be asked to sign in, leave a picture ID and
sign out.</TE>
<TE>   Firms that provide workers on the premises routinely, such as
housekeepers, safety patrol officers, painters, carpet-cleaning
services and gardeners, may be asked to provide proof that employees
are checked for criminal records and are bonded.</TE>
<TE>   Regular contract employees might be asked to wear identifying
uniforms or name tag with picture while on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   * Movers may also be asked for a picture ID.</TE>
<TE>   * Informational meetings: Tenants might be invited to hear safety
experts talk and answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Keys: Procedures for obtaining keys might be tightened.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Second-Home Market Remained Hot in 2001</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of second homes, including vacation homes and investment
property, declined last year but remained above historic norms, and
prices of second homes rose sharply, according to the National Assn.
of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   There were 359,000 single-family second-home sales last year, down
4.8% from a record 377,000 sales in 1999, according to the NAR's
biennial survey "Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers," which will be
published later this month. However, last year recorded the
second-highest sales total since the series began in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   "The second-home market is extremely hot and will be for some time
to come," said NAR President Martin Edwards Jr.</LD>
<TE>   NAR predicted that the demographic impact alone from large numbers
of people in their 40s and 50s entering the second-home market could
potentially add 100,000 to 150,000 housing starts each year through
the end of the decade. However, given the limited availability of
desirable locations that can be developed, builders active in this
market indicate actual construction starts have been about half of
that level.</TE>
<TE>   NAR reported that 5.5% of all homes sold last year were second
homes, and estimated that half of those were for recreational use and
half were held as rental property.</TE>

<LD>The Keston California Infrastructure Institute has been formed at the
University of Southern California's Lusk Center to address the
infrastructure challenges faced by the state.</LD>
<LD>   The Keston Institute was funded with a lead gift from Michael and
Linda Keston. Michael Keston is an adjunct professor in the USC
School of Policy, Planning and Development and chairman and CEO of
the real estate investment firm Larwin Co. in Encino. He was named
chairman of the board and senior fellow of the institute.</LD>
<LD>   California's population is projected to increase by 5 million
people per decade and reach 45 million by 2020, according to the Lusk
Center. Recent studies conclude that California's infrastructure is
inadequate to support its rapidly growing population and economy.</LD>

<HD>'Ratification' Is Fraught With Peril</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: There are 50 units in our planned community development
encumbered with deed restrictions. The board pre-plans each annual
homeowner association meeting so members are unable to fully
participate. Board members enlist friends to make predetermined
motions and seconds from the floor. To create a rushed environment,
meetings are held in a public place with time restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   At last year's annual meeting, a friend of the board made a motion
from the floor to ratify all the actions of the board for their
two-year term, and another friend of the board immediately seconded
it. In my 30 years of attending annual meetings, this was the first
and only time a motion to ratify was made. Most of us did not know or
understand the meaning of "ratification," and the board did not
explain.</LD>
<LD>   The board's goal was to hurry a ratification vote because of
unscrupulous actions taken throughout their two terms. The vote
ratified those actions.</LD>
<TE>   Members asked questions about the management company, our bank
records and the various contractual agreements that were made and
were matter-of-factly told, "We are the board, and the law says
homeowners don't have a right to know, so we don't have to tell you."
Some voted against it, but the majority were pressured into voting
for ratification, even though they had no clue what it meant or what
they were voting for. The management company was present and
documented each vote. I kept my own tally.</TE>
<TE>   At this year's annual meeting, a motion was made to amend last
year's minutes to include the ratification vote breakdown. The board
refused and said it don't know what the last annual meeting votes
were and that no one kept a tally.</TE>
<TE>   I find its actions suspicious. What is ratification, and did I do
the right thing in voting against it? How does this ratification vote
affect the homeowners who voted for or against it?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: "Ratification" is arguably the most dangerous word
associated with deed-restricted property located within a common
interest development or planned community setting.</TE>
<TE>   In the corporate and legal sense, ratification means approval of
all board actions, even if those acts were unauthorized, fraudulent
or incur liability to the association and all its homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote for board elections, a ratification vote is
probably the most important vote homeowners can make, and it has
far-reaching implications for all homeowners. Merely asking that the
board's acts be ratified is not enough to warrant voting in favor of
ratification.</TE>
<TE>   Should a lawsuit against the board result from a breach of that
contract, the entire association may be liable, because it has
ratified the board's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Acts that might be illegal and result in liability only for an
offending board member can lead to liability for every homeowner if
those acts are ratified.</TE>
<TE>   Among the legal requirements for ratification is a full
explanation of what act is being ratified. California courts have
said that regardless of the capacity to understand transactions, one
must have notice of those transactions before he or she can be held
to assent to them. Notice means the board has the duty to describe in
detail every act for which ratification is being sought and deliver
that description to each homeowner who is being asked to ratify.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no specific wording in the Davis-Stirling Act
requiring that board acts be ratified or requiring this type of
notice, the cases interpreting ratification votes make that notice
requirement mandatory. The board's failure to include in the minutes
a record of the vote on ratification may be indicative of its efforts
to hide actions that could conceivably result in homeowner liability.</TE>
<TE>   Although no law requires the board to maintain voting records for
any time period--and the California Senate recently rejected such
legislation after near unanimous passage by the Assembly--your
board's admission that it did not keep the votes could establish that
the parameters for approval or ratification were not met.</TE>
<TE>   If the homeowner does not understand the actions being ratified or
the board fails to explain them satisfactorily so that homeowners are
confident voting for ratification, then rejection is the homeowner's
safest option.</TE>
<TE>   A legal parallel is when one co-signs for a loan and the borrower
defaults. It is the co-signer who has to pay. The same applies to
homeowners when a board member signs a contract without authority,
then later asks for ratification. When homeowners ratify that act,

<LD>La Bella Toscana (the Tuscan Beauty) is the last available estate of
nine built in a newly developed gated community in Rancho Santa Fe,
which tops the Census Bureau's list, released last week, of the 10
wealthiest communities in the United States. With 1,200 households,
Rancho Santa Fe has an average per capita income of $113,132.</LD>
<LD>   The house was developed by a rancher who was the visionary behind
one of the first indoor shopping malls, during the '60s, in the
Midwest. After building several personal luxury homes, he decided to
develop a community of estates in Rancho Santa Fe. He picked the
locale for its reputation, through the Robb Report and Barron's
magazine, as one of the best places to live in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   After pacing the site of his proposed project there, he concluded
that the area had a true flavor of Tuscany, which is why he called
his development Tuscan Estates. It is seven miles east of the Pacific
Ocean.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: Built by San Diego-area builder Jim Sylvester,
this house is the largest and priciest in its community, where asking
prices started at $6 million before the other eight homes were sold.
The smallest home site is two acres. The smallest home size is 10,000
square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $11.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Size: With about 22,000 square feet of living space, the home has
five bedrooms, 6.5 bathrooms in the main villa; a detached
two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom guest villa; a detached office villa; and a
garage with 10 car spaces. It sits on five acres with a gated
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home, surrounded by manicured grounds and
landscaping to provide privacy, has 11-foot-high hand-carved Honduran
mahogany front doors; an 1,850-square-foot master suite; a butler's
pantry; a free-standing staircase connecting the music room and main
floor to the upstairs office suite; a two-story library; a media
room; a billiard room with a wet bar and wine cellar; a pool with a
waterfall and a spa; and a pool pavilion with a bathroom, shower and
changing room. Landscaping includes three rose gardens and a fruit
orchard, including olive and date trees.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Rita Rudner and her husband, producer Martin Bergman, have
sold their Beverly Hills home for close to its $2.4-million asking
price.</LD>
<LD>   Rudner has just begun her second year of a $20-million, four-year
contract to appear as a headliner in Las Vegas at the Cabaret Theatre
of New York-New York Hotel &amp; Casino.</LD>
<LD>   The couple are getting ready to move into their newly built
three-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot penthouse overlooking the Las Vegas
Strip, and they plan to retain their three-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot
Palm Desert home, which they built in 1998. That home overlooks a
private golf course and lake.</LD>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills home that Rudner and Bergman sold has five
bedrooms and 6.5 baths in 6,000 square feet, including a guesthouse.
The Mediterranean-style estate also has a pool, media room and indoor
driving range. The couple had owned it since it was built in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Rudner, in her mid-40s, appeared in the Broadway productions of
"Mack and Mabel," "They're Playing Our Song" and "Annie" before she
became a stand-up comedian in 1980. Since then she has starred in
three solo HBO comedy specials and, in 1992, she wrote the first of
three books. Her most recent, a comic novel, is "Tickled Pink"
(Pocket Books, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   Rudner and Berman co-wrote the screenplay for the 1992 movie
"Peter's Friends," in which she co-starred with Emma Thompson and
Kenneth Branagh, who directed the film. Rudner and Berman also
co-wrote the USA Network movie "A Weekend in the Country" (1996). She
co-starred in the film, which Bergman produced and directed.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Polan, an associate manager at Coldwell Banker's Beverly
Hills North office, represented Rudner and Bergman in their sale.
Danny Harvey and Joyce Essex of the same office represented the
buyer, a TV executive.</TE>
<TE>   The Storer House in Hollywood, designed by late architect Frank
Lloyd Wright, has been sold for nearly its $3.5-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Joel Silver, who had owned the house for 17 years, sold
the house to a business executive described as having "a great
understanding and appreciation for historical landmark architectural
property."</TE>
<TE>   Silver, who produced the "Lethal Weapon" films and other movies
such as "13 Ghosts" (2001) and "The Matrix" (1999), meticulously
restored the house with the help of architect Eric Wright, Frank
Lloyd Wright's grandson.</TE>
<TE>   The house, an example of Wright's pre-Columbian or early Modernist
architecture, is one of four houses built in L.A. by the late
architect using patterned concrete blocks. Designed in 1922 for
homeopathic physician John Storer, the house has three bedrooms, a
den and three bathrooms in about 3,000 square feet. The home also has
a pool, which was originally planned but not built until Silver
bought the property.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Feder of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, represented both
sides of the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa has purchased a home on four acres in
Beverly Hills for about $12.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   During the early '90s, London financier Robert Manoukian, once an
emissary of the sultan of Brunei, had plans to build a
46,000-square-foot estate on the site. Manoukian's plans caused a
neighborhood furor. The home was never built.</TE>
<TE>   Two houses on the four-acre site were built after the site was
subdivided in 1953. One was built by architect William Pereira; the
other was owned at one time by the late screenwriter Nunnally
Johnson. Manoukian planned to build a pool and a tennis court in
place of the houses.</TE>
<TE>   The property bought by Kresa also still has its original
18,000-square-foot Spanish-style house, built in 1927. The 40-room
house was once owned by actor James Coburn, who lived there for about
15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa plans to refurbish the former Coburn home and remodel the
two houses on the remaining lots, Westside sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kresa's leadership, Northrop Grumman Corp. has taken over 14
companies in the last decade, amassing a business that has interests
in every aspect of the nation's military. Northrop's recent bid to
take over TRW is on hold until September while it reviews financial
information.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian of Prudential John Aaroe Estates, Beverly Hills,
represented Kresa in his purchase, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Williams, a KCBS Channel 2 weathercaster, has sold his
Hollywood Hills home for about $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Seen regularly on the station's weekend newscasts, Williams, in
his mid-30s, is probably best known for his comfortable style during
live weather remotes from various communities throughout the L.A.
area.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, son of the late legendary defense attorney Edward
Bennett Williams (a former owner of the Baltimore Orioles and
Washington Redskins), is looking to buy another house in the same
area.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Beverly Hills designer Lynn Palmer, he completed
a total renovation in 1997 of the house he just sold.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1976, the contemporary villa has three bedrooms and 3.5
baths in about 2,700 square feet. The house--which also has a gym, a
pool and views from downtown L.A. to the ocean--is on a hill
overlooking Sunset Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Robinson of DBL Beverly Hills had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Blasi, who stars as a young single mother and Latina doctor
in the Lifetime TV series "Strong Medicine," has purchased a Hermosa
Beach home for $849,000, and she has listed her former home in the
Laurel Canyon area at $879,000.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional-style home in the canyon has three bedrooms in
2,800 square feet. It also has canyon views. Built in 1979, it was
recently remodeled.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 2001, the Mediterranean-style Hermosa home has two
bedrooms in about 1,800 square feet and panoramic ocean views. The
lower level has an office with south-facing windows.</TE>
<TE>   Before "Strong Medicine," in its third season, Blasi, 28, appeared
in a recurring role on the CBS soap "The Bold and the Beautiful," and
she had guest-starring roles in "Drew Carey," "Becker" and "Frasier."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she starred in the Showtime film "Noriega: God's
Favorite." She recently starred in "The Vagina Monologues" at the
Apollo Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Kroger of the Sunset office, DBL Realtors, and Nick Segal,
with DBL in Santa Monica, have the listing on the canyon home. Tina
Williams and Gary Brutsch, both with Shorewood Realtors, had the
listing on the Hermosa house.</TE>
<TE>   "The Newport Beach real estate market is on fire," said Bill Cote
of the Cote Realty Group in Corona del Mar, an area of Newport Beach.
Cote, who tracks all single-family sales in Newport Beach of more
than $3 million each, said that to date this year, there have been 27
sales for more than $3 million each; for all of last year, there were
36. In April of this year, there were 11 sales at more than $3
million each, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a comparison, Cote gave these numbers for four other years in
which $3-million-plus houses were sold in Newport Beach: 17 (1997);
13 (1998); 25 (1999); and 38 (2000).</TE>

<DH>A couple are torn between remodeling their tiny Venice home
or moving to a more affordable area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul and Mary Beth Trautwein have enjoyed walks to the beach and
restaurants for the three years they've lived in the arty community
of Venice. But with the birth of a daughter two years ago, and with
Paul, a Web master and graphic designer, now working full time from
home, the Trautweins' 800-square-foot bungalow is no longer quaint.
It's cramped.</LD>
<LD>   "We are running out of room here. My office space is now in our
bedroom, and that's not conducive for a client meeting," said Paul,
38, who gave up his office to provide a bedroom for daughter Edith.</LD>
<LD>   The couple--who bought their two-bedroom bungalow for $239,000 in
1999--are now torn between undertaking a major remodel to add space
or leaving the neighborhood they love. "I'd almost forgo my needs,"
Paul said, "just so we could stay here."</LD>
<TE>   The couple's fantasy is to add a second story to their existing
home that would include a master bedroom, a second bath and an
outdoor deck--especially important because the house sits on a lot of
only 2,200 square feet. All told, the remodel would add about 500
square feet and cost about $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   A much less costly option would be to convert the bungalow's
200-square-foot garage into office space for Paul. But the city of
Los Angeles requires homes built in that era to have at least a
one-car usable garage.</TE>
<TE>   A third option--by far, the Trautweins' least favorite--is to
move. "We would prefer building another bedroom here," said Mary
Beth, a graphic designer who works for the Getty Museum designing
exhibitions. "But it feels like it would be beyond our reach."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Khoshnam, president of KEC Financial, a mortgage company
based in Tarzana, recommended the couple solve their space problems
by moving. "To remodel will be difficult for them," Khoshnam said.
"They should sell and buy a new home."</TE>
<TE>   Converting the garage into office space, he said, wouldn't add
value to the home, and undergoing a major rebuild could take from
four to eight months, during which they would have to rent elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have not [undergone major construction before]," said
Khoshnam, who also has a contractor's license, "it will not be a
picnic."</TE>
<TE>   Even though adding a second story to the property would most
likely increase its value, Sandy Berens, a real estate agent with
Coldwell Banker's Marina del Rey office who specializes in the Venice
area, worried that the Trautweins would not be able to resell the
bungalow to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd have to list the house someday in the $540,000 range to
make it worth their while," she said. Instead, Berens recommended the
Trautweins sell the bungalow now--listing it at $425,000 or more--and
take advantage of the current sellers' market. If so, she said, they
could make a nearly $200,000 profit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's against all odds that this house would be worth that,"
Berens said. "We may never see this kind of market again." Remodeling
now and trying to recoup those costs later, when the market may not
be so hot, she said, "doesn't make sense to me.... They should move.
They've made an incredible profit."</TE>
<TE>   But the Trautweins--who married five years ago after moving to Los
Angeles from Philadelphia--appear split on that. "Mary Beth is in
favor [of moving]," Paul said, "but I am reluctant. I love this
house. I love our neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the couple was open to looking at properties in Culver City
and, reluctantly, the San Fernando Valley. Based on the Trautweins'
excellent credit, Khoshnam, the mortgage broker, pre-approved the
couple for a $220,000 loan. That loan, along with an approximate
$200,000 they would have in equity from the bungalow, would let them
shop for homes in the $350,000 to $450,000 price range while
increasing their monthly housing cost by only $300 a month to $1,700.</TE>
<TE>   But as many buyers in the market have found, inventory is tight.
Berens was able to find only six homes in the Culver City, Venice and
West Los Angeles areas in the Trautweins' price range with three
bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the most sought-after price level in town," Berens
said. "First-time buyers are looking at that price level, as are
young couples selling their first homes and moving up."</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the homes would increase the Trautweins' living
space, none had two baths and many were in poor locations, near
freeways or on busy streets.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the extra bedroom," Berens said, "but the space is
probably only a couple of hundred of square feet more [than] what
they have now."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Berens suggested what Paul feared the most: that the
Trautweins look in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much a fact that you can get more for your money in
the Valley," said Dorene Martin, a real estate agent with Coldwell
Banker's Studio City office who works frequently with Berens. "We are
seeing a lot of Westsiders from Westwood, Brentwood and Santa Monica
who are figuring that out now."</TE>
<TE>   A property search in the San Fernando Valley found 11 properties
from $349,000 to $425,000 ranging in size from 1,266 to 1,891 square
feet--a few that were more than double the size of the Trautweins'
bungalow. The homes were in Burbank, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Tarzana
and Valley Village. One house in particular, on a tree-lined street
in Van Nuys for $359,000, was on a 7,000-square-foot corner lot and
had a fenced swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   "They would have loved this house," said Martin of the property
that sold to another buyer in a matter of days. "I don't know anyone
who wouldn't have loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Martin said there are some Westsiders who simply won't move
to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "For some people, there is a perception that the Valley is the
suburbs, and they are resistant to that and the commute," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trautweins felt that although the homes in the Valley were
"cute," they weren't thrilled with their locations and found that
many needed repairs and that the homes didn't offer them enough for a
complete lifestyle change.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think the houses were so much bigger," Mary Beth said.
"And there was no street scene. Here in Venice, people can walk
around. I like that.... The Valley just doesn't make sense for us."</TE>
<TE>   But the Trautweins learned after crunching numbers that adding a
second story to their bungalow may not make sense either.</TE>
<TE>   Khoshnam recommended the couple take out a new first mortgage for
$300,000 to cover the cost of the remodel and what they owe on the
bungalow. But a $300,000, 30-year fixed loan with an interest rate of
6.75% would increase their monthly mortgage payment to $2,300--out of
the Trautweins' reach.</TE>
<TE>   A less costly option would be for the Trautweins to take out a
home-equity line of credit for $150,000 at a 4.9% adjustable interest
rate for the remodel. That second loan would amount to an additional
$620 in initial monthly payments on top of their current $1,300
mortgage--or $1,920 total.</TE>
<TE>   But Khoshnam warned against that. "Interest rates may go up and so
will the payment. [The home-equity line of credit] is only a
short-term solution," he said, and it's also out of their price
range.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Trautweins hadn't factored in the cost of
relocating during the remodel--which could increase their monthly
living expense by $1,500 to $1,700 a month for a comparable rental.</TE>
<TE>   The remodel would be within their budget, Khoshnam said, only if
they found a contractor who could do the job for $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, the Trautweins have decided to stay in Venice and
work on ways to bring down the cost of the remodel, including having
Paul do some of the work.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned we're not ready to spend $150,000 for a remodel,"
he said. They plan to continue to look for properties in the Culver
City area and research which neighborhoods have the best elementary
school for Edith.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, they said, they aren't going to be pressured into
selling a house they love. "We're going to continue working on our
house and not be so reactionary to the market," Mary Beth said. "If
our house goes down in value, other houses will too. It all
fluctuates wildly."</TE>

<TE>   This Month's Home Buyer Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Subjects: Paul, 38, and Mary Beth Trautwein, 37</TE>
<TE>   Occupations: Paul is a freelance graphic designer and Webmaster

College. Mary Beth works for the Getty Center in exhibition design.</TE>
<TE>   Combined Gross Income: $64,749 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Goal: The Trautweins need more space for Paul's business and for

<TE>   The Problem: Mary Beth and Paul love their Venice neighborhood and
are hesitant to move, even if it means having a larger home with a
yard. They are debating adding a second story to their home--a major
renovation that could take from four to eight months--or moving to a
new area such as the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   What Options the Experts Recommend</TE>
<TE>   * Capitalize on today's strong seller's market and sell the
bungalow now.</TE>
<TE>   * Since there is nothing available in their price range in the
Venice area, look for a larger home in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   * Research public elementary schools on the Web at

<HD>What Median Buys</HD>
<DH>The Southland has hit a record $258,000 for this benchmark
figure.  That gets anything from small to sprawling--depending on,

<LD>Estelle Clay learned just how competitive the current housing market
can be when she put her three-bedroom Bellflower condo on the market
early this spring and eight offers above the asking price quickly
rolled in.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the elementary school administrator, pre-approved for
a home loan and armed with a 15% down payment, still was stunned to
find herself on the losing end of three successive bidding wars for a
newly constructed home in a development nearby. She landed a house
there on the fourth try, but only after offering to pay far more than
the $268,000 asking price.</LD>
<LD>   Clay, like many frustrated home buyers today, wasn't competing for
an entry-level home, nor was she vying for a million-dollar mansion.
She simply sought a home priced at what is now the median for
Southern California, a challenge that grows harder every day.</LD>
<TE>   Low mortgage interest rates and ever-shrinking inventory have
pushed the median price of homes in Southern California up 15.7% over
last year to a record $258,000, according to DataQuick Information
Systems. The median price is the amount at which half the homes sold
for more and half sold for less.</TE>
<TE>   The year-over-year increase was the strongest since June 1989,
when prices reached $174,000, up 16% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Further fueling interest in home buying, the average rate for a
30-year fixed mortgage with one point in Southern California was
6.48% last week compared to 7.02% a year ago, said Earl Peattie of
National Financial News Services.</TE>
<TE>   But the low rates aren't enough to offset the high price of
houses, so frustrated buyers find themselves scrambling to purchase
homes they can afford. Sellers, meanwhile, are turning down perfectly
good offers because they can't find move-up homes in their price
range.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exuberant market," said John Karevoll, a DataQuick
analyst. "But we're scraping the bottom of the barrel for inventory."</TE>
<TE>   So what can you get for $258,000? That depends on where you look
in Southern California, where homes in that range run from cramped to
considerable, according to DataQuick research.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County's Huntington Beach, for example, an
872-square-foot one-bedroom home sold in April for the Southern
California median price, while in Riverside County's Temecula, a
four-bedroom home with 2,200 square feet went for the same price.</TE>
<TE>   In Arcadia, a two-bedroom home in 866 square feet was purchased in
April for $258,000, while in Paramount, a four-bedroom
2,055-square-foot home was bought for the same price, according to
DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   "It blows your mind when you see what homes cost," said Candice
Peck, 26, a San Clemente first-time buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Peck and her 27-year-old husband, Darren, both teachers, recently
found a 1,077-square-foot two-bedroom condo in the Orange County
beach community for just below Southern California's median home
price. The couple initially was worried about finding an affordable
home after an 800-square-foot two-bedroom unit where they formerly
rented sold for about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Had they looked in the Riverside County community of La Sierra,
they might have quickly found the four-bedroom 2,700-square-foot
house that Teer One Properties agent Rita Gutteriez just sold for
$255,000. But the Pecks held out for their cozy condo, even though it
took much longer to find it.</TE>
<TE>   "We lucked out with our place," Candice Peck said. "We thought
we'd have to move to the desert."</TE>
<TE>   The Pecks' agent agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I shake my head in disbelief," said Debbie Ferrari, the Pecks'
Prudential California Realty agent, about the hoops buyers must jump
through to clinch a deal. "Sellers won't consider contingency buyers
anymore. Recently I've seen buyers with all cash get turned down in
multiple-bidding situations."</TE>
<TE>   To improve their prospects, move-up buyers should sell their homes
before looking for new ones, said Suzanne Gracie, an agent at
Prudential California Realty in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Gracie's clients, Kate and Bruce Halling, recently attempted to
buy a new home in Torrance before selling their Harbor City home but
had to terminate the deal when their buyers suddenly backed out in
mid-escrow.</TE>
<TE>   The couple eventually sold their two-bedroom 978-square-foot home
for $257,000 before moving up to their new Torrance home, which cost
$438,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We sweated out the whole process," Kate Halling said. "You're
competing with buyers that have no contingencies. We were appealing
to the sellers only because we had a 20% down payment."</TE>
<TE>   Even if buyers come in with 20% down, many are stretching to make
the monthly payments, experts say. Buyers who put 20% down on a
$258,000--or median-priced--home, for example, must earn at least
$60,000 a year to qualify for a loan, said David Soleymani, managing
director of First Capital Corp. in Santa Monica. The monthly payment
in that scenario is $1,305.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers who can afford only a 10% down payment for that same house
must earn $72,000 a year and will pay $1,563, Soleymani said.</TE>
<TE>   First, however, buyers must find something to buy. And that's the
toughest hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agents across the Southland bemoan the lack of
available homes, affordable or otherwise. In the San Fernando Valley,
for example, there were only 2,459 home listings in April, compared
with 9,752 listings during the last home-buying peak in April 1989,
according to Mary Lou Williams of the Southland Regional Assn. of
Realtors, which tracks such data.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Santa Clarita, which for more than a decade has attracted
buyers who couldn't find affordable homes close to metropolitan Los
Angeles, less expensive houses are harder to come by, said Rod
McIntosh, a Re/Max of Santa Clarita agent.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have 15 condos available at any given moment, but now
we have about two," McIntosh said.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers seeking homes in the $258,000 range in the Santa Clarita
Valley are lucky to find entry-level older houses, McIntosh said, and
probably will compete with several other bidders.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long time since buyers could find homes, period, in
that range in Studio City and Sherman Oaks, although occasionally
condos become available on the fringe of those two Valley areas, said
Judy Drabin, an agent with Re/Max Grand Central in Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get there the minute the place is listed," Drabin
said, and in all likelihood, it will go for about $5,000 more than
the asking price. Ana Marie Colon, an agent at ERA Rocking Horse
Realty in San Fernando, said that fewer than a handful of listings
are available in the median-price range in northeastern San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   That's still better than the Westside, said Edie Kirschner, a
Coldwell Banker agent in Brentwood, where no homes are listed in
Southern California's median-price range. The last home Kirschner saw
listed near that price was a one-bedroom Wilshire Boulevard condo in
Westwood, which sold for $294,000.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach
and El Segundo, said Steve Goddard, an agent at Re/Max Beach Cities
Realty in Torrance. The best buyers can hope to find in the
median-price range near that area are 50-year-old homes in Gardena or
Lawndale, he said, with three bedrooms in 1,200 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the brisk pace of sales, agents say the home-buying and
selling experience is not a particularly positive one today, even for
agents. Buyers complain that they're being ripped off; sellers think
they've undersold their homes just 30 days after the deal is done and
prices have already gone up next door.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't great for anyone," said Coldwell Banker agent Anita Rich
of Studio City. "We're working four times as hard as we used to for
one sale. We're scrounging all over to make deals."</TE>

<HD>Rings on Wood? Grab the Mayo</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you tried unsuccessfully to remove white rings from fine wood
furniture or built-in surfaces? Contrary to popular belief, a white
ring results from damage to the waxed finish and not to the wood.
Here's a trick to removing those rings.</LD>
<LD>   First, make sure that the surface is clean and dry. Next, place a
small amount of mayonnaise directly over the ring. Cover the area

minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Remove the plastic wrap and lightly rub the mayonnaise into the
finish using a nylon scouring pad and work in the direction of the
grain. Wipe up all the mayonnaise with a soft cloth and restore the
luster to the area with some lemon oil or paste wax.</LD>

<LD>   Series: Monday, 4:15 p.m.; Tuesday, 4:15 p.m.; Wednesday, 4:15
p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Site: Tropicana Field, St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   Matchup: Moments after batting practice concluded Wednesday, 14
players filed into the Devil Rays' training room, where Manager Hal
McRae told them to relax and have fun. That night, the worst team in
the major leagues had 16 hits in an 8-6 victory over Toronto, only
the third time in 19 games the Devil Rays had scored eight or more
runs. With a .248 average with runners in scoring position and a lack
of power and speed, Tampa Bay has presented a less-than-formidable
challenge. The Devil Rays were batting an American League-worst .233
through Tuesday. They stranded 62 runners and converted 65 hits and
21 walks into 20 runs the previous six games.</TE>

<TE>   Matchup: Despite a nagging left knee injury that keeps him out of
the lineup on occasion, left fielder Brian Jordan started the weekend
having hit .420 (21 for 50) with three doubles, two triples, two home

straight games, third baseman Adrian Beltre went on a tear in
Colorado last week, going 8 for 15 with two homers and six RBIs in
three games. Right fielder Shawn Green has cooled considerably since
his weeklong tear from May 21-26, going four for 21 in seven games
before the weekend.</TE>

<HD>This Truly Is Rare Site for U.S. Open</HD>
<DH>Golf: For $39, the public can play the Black Course, which
will serve as the U.S. Open host and is anything but ordinary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG FERGUSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>If not for a public golf course on Long Island, the game might be
missing Tiger Woods.</LD>
<LD>   Earl Woods was in the twilight of his military career at Fort
Hamilton when a staff officer suggested he try golf. They went to
Dyker Beach, where the father of golf's best player was introduced to
the game.</LD>
<LD>   "I got hooked the very first day," Earl Woods said.</LD>
<TE>   He passed on that passion to his son, who likewise honed his game
on public golf courses in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The heritage of Woods' golf comes full circle at the 102nd U.S.
Open, which will be played for the first time at a truly public
course--on Long Island, no less.</TE>
<TE>   Bethpage State Park is owned by the taxpayers and open to all for
only $39 on the weekend, quite a change from the snooty country clubs
that have come to symbolize professional golf.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder they call this championship the "People's Open."</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Open is supposed to be open to everybody, and it should
be played on a public golf course," Woods said. "I think that's
absolutely wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the players: They won't have to sleep in their
cars, which is what everyday people do to secure a tee time on the
Black Course.</TE>
<TE>   "None of our guys would sleep in a car," Brad Faxon said. "Nobody
can relate to that."</TE>
<TE>   No, but many of the 50,000 fans will be able to relate to this
U.S. Open course that will test the world's best players over 72
holes.</TE>
<TE>   "At places like Augusta, all they can do is watch and wonder what
it's like to play," two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen said. "I'm
sure there will be a lot of guys who go, 'I was in that bunker,
Tiger, and I made 9.' "</TE>
<TE>   The most famous landmark on the course is a sign posted by the
first tee that says, "Warning: The Black Course is an extremely
difficult course which is recommended only for highly skilled
golfers."</TE>
<TE>   Just how difficult it is for these "highly skilled" golfers
remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Course will play as a par 70 at 7,214 yards, the longest
in U.S. Open history by one yard over Congressional in 1997. Its 70
bunkers are so expansive that it required about 9,000 tons of sand to
fill them. The fairways will be pinched to about 25 yards, framed by
ankle-deep rough. The greens, however, are relatively flat, leading
some to believe that without windy, brittle conditions on Long
Island, the U.S. Open scoring record of 72 (last set by Woods at
Pebble Beach) is in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to see a lot of train wrecks," USGA executive
director David Fay said. "There's a good possibility of low scores.
The question is, can someone hold it together for four rounds?"</TE>
<TE>   That's one thing about the U.S. Open that never changes, whether
it's played at a country club or a municipal course.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Open is widely regarded as the toughest test in golf, and
for good reason. No other tournament puts such a premium on par. Only
12 players have finished a U.S. Open under par dating to 1995, the
last time it was held on Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Open is more than just a golf tournament," Davis Love
III said. "It's a test of mettle, your patience, your guts. If the
scoring is easy, it would be like any other week. But the U.S. Open
is a test of everything you've got. That's why it's hard to win, and
why we want to win so bad."</TE>
<TE>   The idea to bring the U.S. Open to a public golf course was
planted about a month before the Open was played at Shinnecock Hills
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Fay, who grew up playing at Bethpage, invited 10 of his staff to
meet him unannounced at the Black Course. He wanted their reaction to
a course that Fay always believed could go "belly to belly" with
private clubs such as Winged Foot and Baltusrol.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure my childhood memories weren't just misty,
to be sure the Black was as good as I remember, and it was," Fay
said. "It was clear this was something special."</TE>
<TE>   The only hitch was getting the Black in U.S. Open shape. Normally
that's the burden of the club, but Fay was working with a state
government that doesn't have that kind of money to throw at a public
golf course.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA provided $2.7 million to cover most of the renovations,
and Rees Jones volunteered his services to refurbish and restore the
Black to its original state by using aerial photographs from 1938,
just two years after it opened.</TE>
<TE>   Every hole was tweaked, with the most dramatic change coming at
No. 18. Jones added about 60 yards, and the fairway is only 16 yards
wide as it passes through an enormous cluster of bunkers. The size of
the green also was drastically reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "We want it to be a hole that could change the event, and I think
that's what we've accomplished," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Fay's only lament?</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions are going to be superb," he said. "I'm a little
disappointed. I was hoping it would be a tad scruffier."</TE>
<TE>   The architect of the Black is muddled--the USGA and Bethpage say
it was A.W. Tillinghast. Research by Golf Digest magazine points
toward park superintendent Joseph Burbeck, with Tillinghast as the
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever was behind the Black probably had no idea it would ever
hold a U.S. Open. Then again, a U.S. Open played on a public course
only makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   The National Golf Foundation estimates that 73% of all golf
courses in the United States are public. Its research also shows that
four of five players--and there are about 27 million at last
count--play most of their golf on municipal tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "This was long overdue," Fay said.</TE>
<TE>   The public has had access to other U.S. Open venues, but at a
steep price. Pebble Beach and Pinehurst No. 2 are both resorts that
cost close to $400 a round.</TE>
<TE>   All anyone needs at Bethpage Black is $39 ($31 on weekdays) and a
little luck, not to mention sleepless nights, to get a tee time. It
gets about 30,000 rounds a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows that you don't have to have a multimillion-dollar,
daily-fee golf course or a country club to provide a good
experience," Jeff Maggert said.</TE>
<TE>   It all begins Thursday when the 156-man field starts from split
tees, meaning half of the field will have to start on a brutal
stretch of holes that includes two of the longest par 4s in U.S. Open
history--No. 10 at 492 yards, No. 12 at 499 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Then, it won't matter whether Bethpage is public or private. It's
all about grinding around a championship course and trying to post
the lowest score, just like always.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Open is about staging a national championship on great
golf courses, and we're going to what everybody says is a great golf
course," David Duval said. "If there's any symbolism, it's that
everybody has access, and that the USGA is not discerning between
public and private. They're choosing a championship golf course."</TE>
<TE>   The good news is it will stay that way.</TE>
<TE>   For the next three years, Bethpage has an agreement not to raise
the rates, except for inflation.</TE>

<HD>That Was 30 Years Ago, Tiger</HD>
<DH>Woods aims to be first since Nicklaus to take first two
legs of Grand Slam</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG FERGUSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The number is still one of the most staggering in golf. Tiger Woods
was 15 strokes better than everyone else in the U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach, the largest margin in 142 years of major championships.</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, the gap between Woods and his peers seems as
wide.</LD>
<LD>   "Tiger is good, but the whole world isn't going to fall down
forever," Jack Nicklaus said. "They'll figure it out. It's going to
happen."</LD>
<TE>   That brings up two questions heading into the 102nd U.S. Open at
Bethpage State Park, where Woods will try to become the first player
since Nicklaus in 1972 to win the first two legs of the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Who? And when?</TE>
<TE>   The gap has closed at times. There have been seven majors played
since Woods' historic victory at Pebble Beach, and he has only won
four of them.</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen won the U.S. Open last year and ended Woods' record
run of four consecutive majors. David Duval, the only other player
besides Woods to be ranked No. 1 the past four years, won his first
major at the British Open. The other went to David Toms, whose
victory at the PGA Championship kept Phil Mickelson
zero-for-the-majors.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the "bad" news.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says his swing is starting to round into the kind of form he
had in 2000, when he won nine PGA Tour events and three consecutive
majors, setting a scoring in each of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty close," he said. "Summer of 2000, I think my long
iron game was just a touch more sharp than it is right now. But it's
coming."</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie got a close look at it in Germany, when he lost
to Woods on the third playoff hole. They played the 18th hole at St.
Leon-Rot four times--once in regulation, three times in the
playoff--and Woods was never in trouble off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   "The four two-irons he hit on the last hole were probably the most
impressive four shots I have ever seen in golf," Montgomerie said.
"They actually finished in the same space. Very, very impressive,
indeed. If that's the standard that we have to attain, well, we all
have a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   The fact Woods is the only repeat winner on the PGA Tour this year
is a sign that no one else is particularly close to entering his
domain.</TE>
<TE>   The only threats have come from Els and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion whose game has been solid all
season, held off a hard-charging Woods at Doral and won the next week
against a strong European field in the Dubai Desert Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson won his first tournament after a five-month break at the
Bob Hope Classic, and his name has become a fixture on Sunday
leaderboards. He even went so far as to question the mettle of his
peers earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen anybody step up to the plate and challenge Tiger
the way I have," he said. "He's the best player in the game, and I am
not going to back down from him. I see these other guys wilt, and
it's just unbelievable to me that they haven't been able to play
their best golf when he's in contention."</TE>
<TE>   Nice speech, but Mickelson had his chance at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everyone did.</TE>
<TE>   Woods entered the final round at Augusta chased by five of the
next six players behind him in the world ranking. He never trailed.
He was never challenged.</TE>
<TE>   The gap grew.</TE>
<TE>   "They were playing Tiger. They should have been playing the
course," said Nicklaus, who managed to stay awake watching the back
nine on TV. "He didn't do anything the last nine holes except stay
out of harm's way. Nobody challenged him. Piece of cake."</TE>
<TE>   Els, who tried to make a move on No. 13 at Augusta and instead
took triple bogey, could not have agreed more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the biggest problem of the tour at the moment,"
Els said. "Guys get kind of sucked into his game plan. I'm sure he
doesn't play myself or Mickelson or the players. I think he plays the
golf course and plays to the best of his ability.</TE>
<TE>   "And I think that's why there's such a big gap."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Open is the one major that has given Woods the most
problems. Despite shattering several records at Pebble Beach, that
was his only U.S. Open where he finished under par, and only his
second top-10.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Course at Bethpage will be the longest in U.S. Open
history (7,214 yards, par 70), by one yard over Congressional in
1997. Woods was never a factor in that U.S. Open, starting with a 74
and finishing in a tie for 19th.</TE>
<TE>   That was his first chance at a real Grand Slam--all four majors in
the same year. He gets his third crack at it this week.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't focus on four in a row," Woods said. "You can't win all
four in one week. People don't realize you have to win four different
tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether Woods can stack up to the Black--and if
anyone can measure up to Woods, especially on the back nine of a
major championship.</TE>
<TE>   While he has finished third in the majors on two occasions (Royal
Birkdale in the 1998 British Open and Pinehurst No. 2 in the 1999
U.S. Open), Woods has won all seven times when he has had a lead on
the back nine Sunday at a major. His record when he has at least a
share of the 54-hole lead is astounding--23-2 on the PGA Tour, 7-0 in
the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to beat Tiger Woods mentally," Montgomerie said.
"You're not going to beat him physically. You're not going to beat
him by outdriving him. You're not going to beat him with putting,
chipping or iron play. The only way to beat Tiger is by shooting a
lower score than he does."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds simple enough. Getting it done is quite a chore.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Golf Digest, Tom Weiskopf described the
hopeless feeling of competing against Nicklaus in the majors, which
sounds a lot like what some of today's best players face against
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Going head to head against Nicklaus in a major was like trying to
drain the Pacific Ocean with a teacup," Weiskopf said. "You stand on
the first tee knowing that your very best golf might not be good
enough."</TE>
<TE>   The first time Nicklaus was in contention for a major, as a
20-year-old amateur, he was paired with Ben Hogan and finished second
to Arnold Palmer in the 1960 U.S. Open. He beat Palmer for his first
of 18 majors in a playoff at the 1962 U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two decades, Nicklaus waged memorable battles with
Palmer, Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson and Johnny Miller. He
was a runner-up 19 times in the majors, four each to Trevino and
Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Who will be Woods' rival?</TE>
<TE>   Will he have any?</TE>

<HD>Some 'Idol' Thoughts</HD>
<DH>The show's most outspoken talent judge says, 'If they ...
want to be told the truth, they will be told.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BMG Records executive Simon Cowell became the guy everyone loved to
hate last year as the acerbic judge on the successful British TV
series "Pop Idol." And now the Englishman will be offering up
critical barbs on the U.S. version of the unscripted series,
"American Idol: The Search for a Superstar," premiering Tuesday on
Fox.</LD>
<LD>   During one of the auditions, for example, he tells a young hopeful
that she should hire a lawyer so she can sue her vocal coach.</LD>
<LD>   Cowell says he's just trying to give the contestants, ages 16-24,
"constructive" criticism.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not there to stop someone from chasing their dream," he
says. "If they believe they are great, good luck to them. But if they
come to our audition and they want to be told the truth, they will be
told."</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 singers have auditioned for "American Idol" at
talent searches held in Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York,
Atlanta, Dallas and Miami. Besides Cowell, the judges include singer
Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, a Grammy Award-winning music industry
veteran and former executive at MCA Records. KYSR-FM (98.7) afternoon
DJ Ryan Seacrest and comic actor Brian Dunkleman are the hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Following the two-part premiere, viewers will determine each week
whether constants advance to the next round by casting their votes
via phone. The winner will receive a recording contract with RCA.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell has found that contestants are a bit more aggressive here
than in England. Though he was once threatened by a rejected
contestant in the U.K., he admits he almost got beaten up after the
New York audition by three participants who were angered by his
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't do the show without security," he says. "I have spent
a fortune on my teeth, and I intend to keep them."</TE>
<TE>   His outspoken opinions have also irked the other judges. "Randy
has already offered to beat me up," Cowell says gleefully. "Paula has
threatened to walk off because of my attitude. I think Paula's
problem is that there is a lot of sexual tension between the two of
us. I felt it on the first day I met her."</TE>
<TE>   Seacrest and Dunkleman provide moral support for the hopefuls.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not, obviously, here to judge the talent or give them the
nod to go on the next level," says Seacrest. "We are there to hang
out, ask them how they are feeling, talk about their nerves and
really be their friends. Both Brian and I have had the opportunity to
have some wonderfully energetic and exciting moments and, at the same
time, some very difficult moments when the kids didn't have what it
takes and they were destroyed, their hearts were broken."</TE>
<TE>   Co-executive producer Nigel Lythgoe, who also did the British
version, says "American Idol" is not a retread of two other recent
series about music hopefuls, WB's "Popstars" and ABC's "Making the
Band."</TE>
<TE>   "With 'Popstars' and 'Making the Band,' you have to constantly
think, 'Will this person fit into a band?' " Lythgoe says. "Here you
are looking for an outstanding individual. The second thing is that
at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what the judges think
because once the top 30 contestants are there, the public takes over
and the public decides on the top 10. Then each week, the public
knocks one of them out."</TE>
<TE>   Lythgoe maintains that "American Idol" is less a talent show and
more a slice of human drama, "like the kid who turned up and said to
the judges, 'Both my parents are deaf and they'll never hear me
sing.' And he sang 'When I Fall in Love' and signed it at the same
time. It was just beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   There have also been numerous humorous incidents, especially
revolving around contestants lying about their age during the
audition process.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one guy who was 53 telling me he was 23," Lythgoe says. "I
said, 'I don't think so.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, this guy was not 53; he was 73 if he was a day," Cowell
adds. "I am telling you, we have gotten all shapes and sizes."</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol: The Search for a Superstar" can be seen this week
on Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 9 p.m. on Fox. Beginning
next week, it moves to its regular time slot of Tuesdays at 9 p.m.
and Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. The network has rated it TV-G (suitable
for all ages).</TE>

<HD>By and for the Whole Inuit Village</HD>
<DH>For a movie based on a tale told by elders, a Canadian
filmmaker relied on the teamwork used in hunting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS BEALE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was between hunting seasons above the Arctic Circle, so Zacharias
Kunuk was able to take a few days off and fly south to publicize his
new film. Hunting season is important for Kunuk, the world's most
famous, if not only, Inuit filmmaker. The 44-year-old Canadian may
have won the Camera d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival for his
astonishing debut, "The Fast Runner," but he is a country boy at
heart.</LD>
<LD>   Although Kunuk has been a professional video maker for more than
20 years, he still lives in Igloolik, a small community near Baffin
Island, and spends his free time hunting seal, caribou and whale,
like his ancestors did. In fact, as far as Kunuk is concerned,
hunting and filmmaking have a lot in common.</LD>
<LD>   Filmmaking is about teamwork, he says, "just like how we hunt. A
group of us go out there and try to get one seal. Somebody is
standing at the seal hole, while other people are trying to scare it
to them. There has to be teamwork, otherwise it wouldn't work."</LD>
<TE>   This is a long speech for Kunuk, a short, dark-skinned man with
weathered features and a bowlegged, rolling gait that makes it look
as if he has just stepped off the deck of a ship. He has a natural
cultural reserve that he expresses in long pauses before answering
questions, and short, often mystifying responses. Which is one reason
Kunuk was in New York with Norman Cohn, his cinematographer and
business partner, a transplanted New Yorker who has lived in Canada
for years and acts as a sort of ethnographic interpreter. (The two
were in New York in April for an early screening of the film.)</TE>
<TE>   Not that "The Fast Runner," which opens Friday in Los Angeles and
New York, needs much explanation. The first feature film shot in
Inuktitut, Kunuk's native language, and featuring an all-Inuit cast,
it has visual panache and an incident-filled story line that plays
like a cross between "Peyton Place" and "Once Upon a Time in the
West." Based on an Inuit tale that Kunuk first heard as a child, "The
Fast Runner" tells the story of Atanarjuat, a young man blessed with
the gift of speed, who falls in love with a woman promised to another
man.</TE>
<TE>   This universal plot line is fleshed out with occult elements, sex,
fratricide, murder and revenge. Two sequences have already attained
cult status on the film festival circuit, where "The Fast Runner" has
been greeted with ecstatic reviews: One is a head-punching contest
that looks like an Inuit version of an extreme sport; the other is a
magnificent chase scene in which a naked Atanarjuat flees across
miles of sea ice pursued by two men bent on killing him.</TE>
<TE>   "The film is about love, jealousy, murder and revenge," says
Norman Cohn. "What else is there? It's not a surprise that the world
responds to the film. It's not a film about some ethnic
particularity."</TE>
<TE>   True, but "The Fast Runner" also acts as a crash course in Inuit
culture, pre-European contact. The film is filled with scenes that
show how igloos are built, clothes are made, hunting is performed. It
is, in a sense, Kunuk's gift to his people, former nomads who now
live in towns, wear westernized clothing and have access to the
Internet and satellite TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really expected ['The Fast Runner'] to get out of my
community," Kunuk says. "I was making the film for my community.
Sharing the film with the outside world, that's great."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the younger Inuit who appear in "The Fast Runner,"
Kunuk is a product of two distinct cultures. He grew up in sod houses
and igloos, living the nomadic lifestyle of his parents. But at age
6, Kunuk was sent to Igloolik, a town of 1,200, for schooling. There
he grew up as a John Wayne fan, thanks to the 16-millimeter movies
shown weekly at the local community center. Later, he established a
reputation as a talented carver.</TE>
<TE>   It was carving that took Kunuk to the outside
world--Montreal--where he sold his work to a local gallery and used
the money to buy a TV set, VCR and video camera. Back home, he began
to make films about his community, culminating in "Nunavut," (Our
Land) a 13-part TV drama set in 1945 about the clash between
traditional Inuit life and the arrival of the "modern" world. (The
1995 series aired locally only.) In 1990, Kunuk, Cohn and two Inuit
partners had created Igloolik Isuma Productions, an Inuit video
company that has made several films about local culture.</TE>
<TE>   Kunuk and Cohn don't seem overly surprised by the reviews for "The
Fast Runner": The New York Times called it a masterpiece. It's not as
if they've been living on the moon all these years; they've been
making films, all right, it's just that their work has been shoved
into the "ethnographic" category. Because of this, it seems as if
they came out of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't two 20-year-olds," Cohn says. "We'd been at this for a
long time. And we know that the people who make 'Planet of the Apes'
aren't any smarter or more talented than we are. We knew we had
actors and the technical skills. It wasn't our fault that other
people didn't believe us."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Kunuk: "We were seeing all the Hollywood movies. We thought
there are human beings making these; so can we." Not that production
of "The Fast Runner," which cost $1.9 million and was shot on digital
wide-screen video, didn't run into its share of problems.
Pre-production began in 1995, but the film wasn't finished until
nearly five years later. Kunuk and Cohn had funding problems
involving a private investor that delayed shooting for a while--the
film received both Canadian government and private funds--and there
were stoppages related to weather and other factors. In total, the
shoot took 150 days.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike what Cohn calls the "military" style of Hollywood
filmmaking, the production of "The Fast Runner" took on an almost
communal aura. The script was cobbled together from eight versions of
the Atanarjuat legend that village elders told Kunuk.</TE>
<TE>   Cast and crew lived in tents and ate what was caught or killed for
them by local hunters, like the characters in the picture. Costumes
and props were rendered in authentic detail (the film is not
time-specific but is set before the arrival of Europeans).</TE>
<TE>   The acting and directing process was equally democratic. Nearly
all the performers had appeared in other Igloolik Isuma productions,
or as Kunuk puts it, "Norman had been shoving the camera in their
face for 10 years. They were used to it." This led to a directing
style based on an Inuit cultural assumption that Cohn describes as
"once you've grown up to a certain age, everybody is assumed to know
what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Kunuk's seeming bravado, he admits that making the film
was a learning process, and that he expects to be more polished the
next time. Besides, Kunuk was more worried about the reception the
film would get at home. "My greatest moment and my scariest moment
was when we finished the film and showed it to our people," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, three screenings held in Igloolik in December
2000 proved a success. More than 1,500 people saw the film, 300 more
than the town's population. Of the reaction, Kunuk reported: "A lot
of people cried. A lot of people patted us on the back." Next up for
Kunuk and Cohn is a film about the first contact between the Inuit
and Christian missionaries.</TE>
<TE>   The project, in the research stage now, will be shot in video not
only because it's the format Kunuk and Cohn feel most comfortable
with, but also because, says Kunuk, "the place where we are, if we
shot in film and wanted to see our rushes, it would take two weeks to
get them."</TE>
<TE>   The director is asked if he has a favorite scene in "The Fast
Runner," and he gets a faraway look in his eyes while contemplating
his answer.</TE>
<TE>   Finally he says no, he doesn't have a favorite sequence. But then
he adds: "My proudest scene is when we called the actors to the set.
They were coming over the hill in all their costumes. You could
imagine that's how it must have looked like in the past."</TE>

<HD>'Twilight Zone,' in Living Color</HD>
<DH>Two episodes from the classic black-and-white TV series are
debuting on the Southern California stage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Koenig's love of theater has beamed him into a backyard in
North Hollywood. Jumbo jets roar in the evening sky, sometimes
drowning his mild, reedy voice as he coaches 13 actors through a
rehearsal on the lawn.</LD>
<LD>   The man who played Ensign Chekov on "Star Trek" is on a mission to
go where no Los Angeles stage director has gone before. Into another
dimension. A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind.
Into, well, "The Twilight Zone."</LD>
<LD>   Rod Serling's beloved black-and-white television series rarely has
been done as live theater. Now it is having its Southern California
stage premiere. At the helm is the erstwhile navigator of the
Starship Enterprise. As a fixture on "Star Trek," Koenig owes his
fame to perhaps the only tube-spawned science-fiction/fantasy
franchise that has proven hardier and more omnipresent than "The
Twilight Zone." But Koenig also is a veteran stage actor and director
who has enjoyed good reviews in both capacities.</LD>
<TE>   He has his work cut out for him now.</TE>
<TE>   "The Twilight Zone" will premiere as a late-night attraction
during the next four weekends at the Circle Theatre, a 90-seat house
in North Hollywood's El Portal Center for the Arts. The scripts to be
played are "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" and "The Odyssey of
Flight 33," both from the original series that ran on CBS from 1959
to 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Suspending disbelief is crucial for sci-fi productions.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, audiences must be induced to believe that a
14-foot-tall, light green brontosaurus made of plaster and wood and a
6-foot alligator with its jaws agape are not really there. They don't
belong in "The Twilight Zone"; they're the main set pieces for the
theater's concurrently running prime-time attraction, "Criminal
Minds," which concerns escaped convicts biding their time at a
deserted miniature-golf course in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig's solution will be to boldly go where he, at least, has
never gone before. He plans to dispense with props and scenery--the
usual vestiges of stage realism--and let the actors pantomime all of
the action, whether it is piloting a desperately lost passenger
airplane ("Flight 33") or raising a shotgun to fend off the night
terrors that suddenly take hold of a placid, suburban neighborhood
("Maple Street").</TE>
<TE>   "I've never tried this before, and I don't know if this is going
to work," Koenig, 65, says over a late-morning snack of date-nut
bread and decaf ice coffee at a diner in Studio City. If it does,
people will ignore the giant critters that belong to another play.
"You use that old formula: the more you believe in it, the more the
audience is gonna believe in it."</TE>
<TE>   With "Criminal Minds" claiming dibs at El Portal, Koenig and cast
adjourn on a recent evening to the home of one of the "Twilight Zone"
actors. There, in the backyard, with loose-fitting blue jeans and a
black "Macbeth" T-shirt on his small, slender torso and a New York
Yankees cap on his head--they've been his team since 1947--he takes
up the task of helping his players become believers who will not need
props and a set to be believed.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig talks about how, through movement alone, the actors can
portray a mob as a single body or organism beginning to implode under
the weight of its own fear. "I want a sense of the stage constantly
moving," he tells them. "People sizing each other up--and they dare
not turn their backs on each other."</TE>
<TE>   "Maple Street," for Koenig, holds discomfiting echoes of Payson
Avenue, the upper Manhattan street where he grew up. His father, a
Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, was an avowed Communist, although his
living came from that most capitalistic of pursuits, the buying and
selling of assorted dry goods and machinery. As Joseph McCarthy
hunted for Communists and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg died in the
electric chair as Soviet spies, fear took hold in the Koenig
household. It didn't help that threatening notes were appearing in
the family's mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't avoid a pervasive anxiety that at times immobilized
me....There was no one I felt I could trust," Koenig recalled in his
1997 autobiography, "Warped Factors: A Neurotic's Guide to the
Universe."</TE>
<TE>   Fear--of terrorists, not Communists--is again a backdrop to
everyday American life.</TE>
<TE>   "That is perhaps why I chose the ['Maple Street'] episode," Koenig
says. "It's about fear and what it leads to, the hate and the
prejudice and ultimately the destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Fantasy was one of Koenig's childhood escapes, and in 1967 he
became part of one of the most far-reaching fantasies of all. Pavel
Chekov joined the Enterprise crew during the second of the original
"Star Trek"'s three seasons. The producers wanted a Russian to
complete the show's idealistic vision of a diverse sampling of
humanity's best and boldest united--along with the occasional
Vulcan--in an enlightened quest of discovery. Preferably a Russian
who looked like Davy Jones, the teen heartthrob of "The Monkees."
Koenig knew the casting director and fit the bill. He could do the
accent--it was how his parents sounded--and he was as cute as a
Monkee.</TE>
<TE>   Through the TV series and most of the seven "Star Trek" films that
included Chekhov, Koenig was frustrated by his character's lack of
dimension--even for a sidekick. He says 1986's "Star Trek IV: The
Voyage Home" is where Mr. Chekov finally caught a break and got to be
a real person. "That was the greatest fun for me, all I would have
wanted for that character."</TE>
<TE>   He does not impugn his calling card--"If I wasn't that person from
'Star Trek,' you probably wouldn't be interviewing me"--but he always
has sought other creative outlets. Among them are writing for
television and film and playing a recurring role as a bad guy on the
1990s "Star Trek" offshoot, "Babylon 5."</TE>
<TE>   For the last three years, Koenig has played Scrooge in a seasonal
production of "A Christmas Carol" in Thousand Oaks; he says the
Trekkies eat it up when he does Scrooge's transformation scene at
"Star Trek" conventions around the globe. From those conclaves--he
says he appears at eight to 10 a year, on average--he reaps "a
considerable portion of my income." Koenig will miss the opening
weekend of "The Twilight Zone" because he's booked at a convention in
Sao Paolo, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig's other stage credits include playing Tom Sawyer in "The
Boys of Autumn," a two-man play in which Mark Twain's boyhood pals,
Tom and Huckleberry Finn, meet as old men who haven't seen each other
in 50 years. In 1990, a Times reviewer hailed the "vivid and even
sublime performances" of Koenig and Mark Lenard, who had played
Spock's father on "Star Trek." In 1996, Koenig directed an Actors
Alley production of "Three By Tenn," an evening of short plays by
Tennessee Williams. The Times review credited him with "insightful
staging [that] brings warmth and compassion to characters alienated
by their overheightened sensitivity."</TE>
<TE>   The Actors Alley connection brought Koenig into "The Twilight
Zone." The venerable troupe, headquartered at El Portal, is now known
as the Company Rep, and Judy Levitt, Koenig's wife of 37 years, is a
member. Five young actors who are current or former Company Rep
members recently spun off their own nonprofit production company, 4
Letter Entertainment. Late last year they sought--and were
granted--the rights to stage any of the "Twilight Zone" scripts by
Serling, who wrote 92 of the 156 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal, says executive producer Tammy Dahlstrom, is to turn
"The Twilight Zone" into a late-night franchise--acted by Company Rep
members--that will run throughout the year. The payoff, they hope,
will be to instill the theatergoing habit in people who otherwise
wouldn't have bought a ticket to a play.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty guarded with the rights to 'The Twilight Zone,' "
CBS spokesman Chris Ender said. "It's very rare. This is an isolated
case to help out a local, nonprofit theater."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Polak, secretary of the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation in
Serling's hometown of Binghamton, N.Y., says he gets a couple of
e-mails a month from theaters and schools that want to stage episodes
of "The Twilight Zone." He directs them to CBS--but denials are
routine. The only exception Polak knows of is Theater Schmeater, a
nonprofit company in Seattle that has been running "The Twilight
Zone" as a late-night attraction since 1994 in a 72-seat converted
garage.</TE>
<TE>   Artistic director Sheila Daniels says most of the shows sell out,
and that some of the Zoners go on to check out the company's other
productions. Years ago, Jonathan Zadok lived in Seattle and was a
regular at the "Twilight Zone" nightcaps. Now, as artistic director
of 4 Letter Entertainment, he is importing the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Original episodes of "The Twilight Zone" play 20 times a week on
cable's Sci Fi Channel; UPN's upcoming fall schedule includes a new
incarnation of "The Twilight Zone" as a weekly, hourlong drama on
Wednesday nights. Host Forest Whitaker will deliver the on-camera
introductions and epilogues that were Serling's trademark.</TE>
<TE>   For Koenig, the Serling monologues are an inviolable part of "The
Twilight Zone" experience and will be performed on stage--although
not as impersonations of "The Twilight Zone" creator, who died in
1975. Otherwise, the director says, his goal is to re-imagine the
stories as fresh pieces for the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to replicate the television series would be an egregious
mistake. It's a very minor concern that the audience might be
anticipating certain kinds of performances based on their memory of
the show. The fun of this is giving it its own life that stands
apart."</TE>

<LD>Young women wearing coveralls take their places in front of a vast
white wall that will, when it comes time for performance, become an
apocalyptic video montage. This may be a theater rehearsal, but
electronics are everywhere: Projectors occupy niches in the wall,
cords thread over the ground like so many Medusa's snakes, and 10
tiny TV monitors rest on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Director Travis Preston picks up a handheld microphone and
narrates the sequence of events for his body-miked actors. "Ladies of
the army," he says, speaking to the supporting players, "the audience
is coming into the space." He's referring to the smaller of two
cavernous areas in a mammoth warehouse near downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   As they walk to and fro in the long, narrow room, the young women
intone fragments of Shakespeare's text. In performance, they will don
masks bearing the face of Lear.</LD>
<TE>   "Does Lear walk thus, speak thus?"</TE>
<TE>   "So young and so untender?"</TE>
<TE>   "Are you our daughter?"</TE>
<TE>   The chorus forms an undulating line across the length of the room.
"A little lighter on the vocal texture, ladies," says Preston,
observing their movements from a perch midway through the space.</TE>
<TE>   "My wits begin to turn," says a regal voice, cutting through the
babble. The forbidding figure enters, striding through the waves of
bodies, who remain trance-like in her presence. She is King Lear,
played by veteran actor Fran Bennett, the longtime Guthrie Theater
player known more recently to L.A. audiences from her outings at
South Coast Repertory, L.A. Women's Shakespeare Company and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Bennett is no ordinary Lear. Directed by Preston and
staged environmentally, in six sites in a 30,000-square-foot former
power plant just off the 5 Freeway, this "King Lear" features
postmodern aesthetics, a suspended car wreck and an array of other,
similarly outsized effects. It opens Friday at the Brewery Arts
Complex.</TE>
<TE>   Four years in the making, the production is one of the theater
community's most highly anticipated events this season. However, it
will be a tough ticket; only 140 people can see each show during its
short run. Naturally, a lot of aspirations are riding on it. But more
than the usual wishes for a well-received production, those involved
hope the success of this "King Lear" will prove there is, indeed, an
appetite here for this kind of large-scale avant-garde work--and will
justify their plans to produce more such events.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. The budget is $450,000--much bigger than
anything Valencia-based California Institute of the Arts has done,
including 2000's Richard Foreman-Sophie Haviland world premiere, "Bad
Behavior," which was produced with a student cast for a fraction of
the budget, at $65,000. What's more, "King Lear" is an even bigger
show than that number suggests. Produced in the circumstances of,
say, a major regional theater, this same show would cost more than
twice that amount, because it would lack the advantage of
cost-sharing with an academic institution.</TE>
<TE>   However, the nearly half-million dollars is seen as seed money for
future productions. "King Lear" is intended to serve as a calling
card for a new producing entity, the Center for New Theater, the
professional producing umbrella for the School of Theater at CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the center has several commissions out. Foreman, one of
the American avant-garde theater's most important artists who is best
known for his New York-based Ontological-Hysteric Theater, will
collaborate with musician Michael Gordon on a musical theater piece
called "What to Wear," which will have its first workshop next year.
Chen Shi-Xheng, director of a highly ambitious international
opera-theater opus, "The Peony Pavilion," is adapting a script called
"Peach Blossom Fan" by Edward Mast. Also, CalArts faculty members
Preston, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks
("Topdog/Underdog") and puppet artist Janie Geiser have projects in
the works.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do something that was a real announcement that the
center was arriving," Preston says. "In the past, movements in the
theater have often coalesced around productions of Shakespeare. We
needed to demonstrate that we could approach a work of sufficient
scale."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the plan was to present "King Lear" in the Roy and Edna
Disney CalArts Theater, or REDCAT, the CalArts-controlled theater
under construction at the Walt Disney Concert Hall complex. REDCAT is
intended to be CalArts' home away from home, giving L.A. the focal
point for experimental performing arts that the city has long lacked.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Center for New Theater is a key part of the
programming there, the site made sense for the kickoff production.
But ultimately that didn't work out. There were two major delays, due
to construction problems and a change in contractor. Finally, in
October, it became clear the center wasn't going to get enough
rehearsal time in the space.</TE>
<TE>   But within six weeks, center officials found a new venue--and the
funds to pay for it. "It was an 11th-hour rescue by an anonymous
contribution to pay for the Brewery space," Susan Solt, Center for
New Theater producer and artistic director, says of the new site, and
the $100,000 tab that came with it.</TE>
<TE>   Director Preston and his colleagues see their mission as giving
this type of high-end avant-garde theater a permanent home in L.A.
It's a daring venture, given that such fare has long been
conspicuously absent from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   That's not because L.A. audiences haven't shown an appetite for
it, as well-attended events such as the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival
and 1987 Los Angeles Festival have demonstrated. Even a lecture by
the iconoclastic Robert Wilson, internationally known stage and opera
director, was standing-room-only at UCLA's Wadsworth Theater in the
early 1990s. Similarly, the work of the late director Reza Abdoh,
seen mostly at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, had a devoted and
enthusiastic following.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in recent years there has been an almost complete
dearth of internationally recognized experimental fare--apart from
the occasional piece at UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts, or at
any number of smaller-budget venues across town. Indeed, while there
is experimental and avant-garde work in L.A., the overwhelming
majority has long been done in smaller venues on smaller budgets.</TE>
<TE>   But the kind of work that can be found regularly in New York and
to an increasingly greater extent in many of Europe's cultural
capitals remains conspicuously absent from a city as large, diverse,
dynamic and wealthy as Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There are simply not organizations in L.A. that have defined
their charge in this way," CalArts President Steven Lavine says. "And
because there are not organizations, then you don't develop audiences
and donors who define their interests in that way." The Center for
New Theater has taken on that mantle. The only question is whether
L.A. is interested.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the theater community are optimistic. "It's exciting to
have people daring to chart new territory," says Robert Egan, Mark
Taper Forum producing director. "I think that kind of experimentation
in the theater is important. They've got their work cut out for them.
If they deliver on their promises, there'll be an audience."</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be more excited about the idea of CalArts making a
bigger place on the L.A. scene for this kind of work," concurs Bart
DeLorenzo, artistic director of the Evidence Room, one of L.A.'s most
aesthetically adventurous smaller theaters. "To see work like that
created here is a great new flavor for L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in black on black, a lightweight sweater thrown casually
over his buff shoulders, Preston sits in the towering space of the
Brewery warehouse. It is a vast, imposing and gloomy place--and yet
he seems to find this kind of menacing environment almost
comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Preston has the pose of the avant-gardist down cold. The brow is
slightly furrowed, the head tilted just so. The corners of his mouth
are turned down in pensive, presumably existential or
deconstructionist, thought. It all fits the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Until he laughs, that is. Then his smile melts away the hard
edges. His warmth shows through and blows the impression altogether.
It's clear why this director gets such committed performances from
his actors--actually, actresses--and why they do his often extreme
bidding. Preston requires a very tightly controlled physicality from
his actors. It's not naturalism, and it's not for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   He's also asking his cast to follow him to the darker side of
Shakespeare. "There's no question that my reading of 'Lear' is an
extremely dark one," he says. "It responds to my personal sense of
catastrophe in contemporary history."</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare's tale of the aging monarch whose willful demands on
his daughters cause his own personal diaspora is removed from its
particular time and place in this production. Since 1999, Preston and
New York-based writer-dramaturge Royston Coppenger have been working
on an adaptation of the text, cutting and reshaping the classic. "The
general philosophy of this adaptation has always been to emphasize
certain aspects of the play that seemed most exciting and
contemporary," he says. "Instead of smoothing out the rough edges in
the play, I've tried to highlight them.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning, this was intended to be a site-specific
production that interacted with its location in downtown L.A., and I
believe that liberates us from certain aspects of representation that
are traditionally associated with Shakespeare," he continues. "So,
for example, in most cases, the 'connecting tissue' of the play has
been excised--all those scenes in which we're informed of changes in
locale or time."</TE>
<TE>   Such changes underscore the play's timelessness--and help explain
why Preston didn't stage "King Lear" sooner. "I felt it transcended
the boundaries of traditional theater space," he says. "I wasn't
going to do the play at Center Stage in Baltimore or at the Yale Rep,
because I felt that the problem of Shakespeare's works is that when
we read them, they're of overpowering imagination, and when we see
them, we're bored to death."</TE>
<TE>   Sheer scale alone suggests why this "King Lear" won't likely be
boring. Like it or loathe it, it will be a "Lear" of its time and
place. "It's a 'Lear' for L.A.; a 'Lear' in L.A.," Preston says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a 'Lear' that's happening on the side of the 5 Freeway in a
building that was discarded. My principal image of catastrophe was a
car wreck--the image that we have on the side of the road that
freezes your blood when you see those overturned cars. We're bringing
the highway in. I'm even going to do a live feed of the 5 Freeway for
the final scene."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Preston is conscious of the history of the text
and comments on it through his use of an all-female cast. In
Shakespeare's time, his plays were performed by all-male casts. "I
felt I could get a harder, and in my view a truer, reading if I had a
female cast."</TE>
<TE>   Solt, the center's producer-artistic director, and Preston go back
to their school days together at Indiana University and the Yale
School of Drama. Solt spent eight years as film director Alan J.
Pakula's producer in New York, but gave up her movie career to become
dean of the School of Theatre at CalArts in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Preston, now head of CalArts' directing program, is an
internationally recognized director of theater and opera whose
unconventional stagings typically use enhanced sound techniques and
visual imagery incorporating film and video. Preston's most recent
productions include "Boris Godounov" and Luigi Nono's "Al Gran Sole
Carico D'Amore," both at the Hamburg State Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Preston's 1996 staging of the Alban Berg opera "Lulu," presented
in the immense Royal Riding School of Christiansborg Castle in
Copenhagen, became a phenemenon because he had Lulu tell her
paramour's fiancee that he was breaking off their engagement--by
scrawling the information on her naked body and parading around the
stage. The New York Times called the production "the highlight of
Copenhagen's opera program for the year." It also said, "Mr. Preston
dealt skillfully with the space by having the cast appear and
disappear through trap doors, while he found novel ways of occupying
the vast stage, not least in one scene by filling it with large,
icon-like paintings of Lulu."</TE>
<TE>   1996 was also the year that Solt lured Preston to CalArts, and
that's when the two hatched the scheme for the Center for New
Theater. "New York was progressively becoming more and more
conservative," Preston says. "New work could be presented there, but
L.A. was a place where new work could be created.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought about a center that would be ambitious to the
maximum," he adds. "We were looking in the direction of international
co-productions, not the avant-garde being ghettoized in small spaces
with limited resources, but something that had the possibility to
produce things of scale."</TE>
<TE>   About the time Preston came to CalArts, Solt and CalArts President
Lavine began recruiting other theater faculty to the Valencia
institution. "Over the last six years, we have recruited an
extraordinary new faculty in the school of theater, all of whom have
been attracted by the possibility of doing a kind of edgy
cross-disciplinary work that is more associated in people's minds
with, say, the Brooklyn Academy of Music than regional theater,"
Lavine says. "Many felt they had to go to Europe, and they've been
persuaded to move to L.A. by this combination of teaching and
professional activity."</TE>
<TE>   These people form the basis of the faculty of the theater school
and the core of the Center for New Theater, including Joan MacIntosh,
a noted actress of the American avant-garde whose 35-year career has
included roles on Broadway. They are also the key players in the cast
and design team of "King Lear."</TE>
<TE>   Having these artists on salary is the single factor that makes
this project affordable. "The subsidy that we are really benefiting
from is the notion that CalArts will hire professional artists to
teach," Solt says. "We've essentially borne the cost of this on the
back of staff contracts of the School of Theater."</TE>
<TE>   The team of faculty artists was supplemented with roughly half a
dozen guest artists, including several cast members and
writer-dramaturge Coppenger.</TE>
<TE>   "King Lear" may even have what's known in the business as "legs."
"There are Europeans, potential co-producers, presenters and
festivals who are coming to this event," Preston reports. "New York
is a known quantity to them, so L.A. is undiscovered territory, and
they're really interested in it."</TE>
<TE>   Based on his "King Lear" experience, Preston is bordering on
bubbly. In fact, his enthusiasm is threatening, once again, to spoil
that avant-garde persona. "I'm convinced that there's now in L.A. a
critical mass of artists and intelligentsia ready for things to
ignite," he says. "There's an incredible kind of openness to things
new. It's also not tied to the stodgier side of European influence.
I'm totally enthusiastic about what's possible," Preston adds. "I
don't think it could happen anywhere else, honestly."</TE>

<DH>Filming a play is risky enough. When it's 'The Women,' an
anachronistic cat fight presents special challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The audience attending the very last Broadway performance of Clare
Boothe Luce's "The Women" leaned forward expectantly. On stage was
actress Jennifer Tilly, sloshing around in a sudsy bathtub. Despite
the business at hand--a phone call to a lover, a nasty exchange with
her stepdaughter, a catty conversation with a friend--the central
question was: Is she wearing anything? The answer, when it was
finally delivered, elicited an audible gasp.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed excessively coy for me to be in the bathtub rolling
back and forth for 20 minutes and not stand up," Tilly says now.
"It's a shocking moment because you [the audience] think you're safe.
People think that I'm going to be in the bath the whole time and then
when she stands up, it's like, 'Aahhh.' "</LD>
<LD>   This one scene excepted, "The Women," which was taped for PBS and
will air June 18 at 9 p.m., is not about the clothes women are not
wearing, but about what they are wearing. (They were designed by
Isaac Mizrahi.) And about what they say and do while wearing them.</LD>
<TE>   "The Women" is a cat fight among high-society friends, written by
a woman, Luce, who was on intimate terms with this social circle,
first as an editor for Vanity Fair, then as wife of Time co-founder
Henry Luce and finally as a congressional representative from
Connecticut. Her career suggests a woman who was, in a manner of
speaking, her own man. The play was first performed on Broadway in
1936 but is best known from director George Cukor's 1939 film
adaptation, starring Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell,
Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard. Those are tall high heels to
fill.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole run people would say, 'You were just like Rosalind
Russell' or 'You were nothing like her,' " says Kristen Johnston, who
starred in this version, which had a limited run at the end of 2001
and the beginning of this year and received mixed reviews. "It was
shocking to me how popular the movie is. It's got a whole legion of
fans. It's like a cult classic. There were actually a lot of good
friends of mine who confessed that they'd seen the movie 10 or 20
times. I don't know if they were coming out of the woodwork or it's
everyone's dirty little secret guilty pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the story is the insufferably noble Mary (Cynthia
Nixon), whose husband is having an affair with a trollop, Crystal
(Tilly). Mary's "friends" include the grotesquely gossipy Sylvia
(Johnston), who's having an affair of her own; the permanently
pregnant Edith (Jennifer Coolidge); the serial divorcee Countess De
Lage (Rue McClanahan); and Mary's amusingly cynical mother, Mrs.
Morehead (Mary Louise Wilson). The men in their lives, almost all of
them philanderers, are omnipresent but never on stage. You have to
wonder how they put anything over on these women. In a sense, they
don't. The enemy is within.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cynical about women and also sort of despairing about women
who are raised to have the wrong values," Nixon says. "I think why
Mary gets duped is that she has friends who aren't really friends.
They are just women she has fallen in with because their husbands are
business associates or they have the same level of income. She never
stops to ask whether they have her best interests at heart. She's so
blissfully unaware, so invested in her husband and her children, that
she never bothers to think about who her friends are. She doesn't
really need friends. And then when she's stripped of her husband and
her home and her place in life, she makes some real friends who not
only help her get her man back, but talk the truth to her."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon is talking about the relevance of the show, which at times
is perilously close to anachronistic--or politically incorrect.
Johnston for one thinks that it's not "today" or "now," but that it
"makes people really glad we no longer live in an era where women, to
hold onto their status, have to hold onto a man. I know it's true,
being a woman in her early 30s who is not married and has everything
she could want."</TE>
<TE>   Tilly is not so sure. "If you look at Hollywood and the power
wives and the Beverly Hills wives, a lot of their status and identity
is who they're married to," she says. "And you also look at the girls
who call themselves actresses, but basically their one goal is to
land a powerful man who can keep them in Versace."</TE>
<TE>   All agree that everybody enjoys a good cat fight, which may be the
unstated reason why PBS chose to make "The Women" the second
installment in its Stage on Screen series. (The first was last
season's live broadcast of "The Man Who Came to Dinner.")</TE>
<TE>   According to Judy Kinberg, who produced "The Women" for PBS (the
play itself was directed by Scott Elliot, the television production
by Jay Sandrich), the appeal of the show is that audiences are
familiar with the Cukor movie and with these particular actresses.
Nixon is on the HBO hit "Sex and the City." Johnston previously
co-starred on the long-running sitcom "3rd Rock From the Sun."
McClanahan is best known for her TV stint on "The Golden Girls." And
Tilly regularly appears in feature films (most recently as Louella
Parsons in "The Cat's Meow").</TE>
<TE>   Many of these actresses started on stage, found fame and fortune
in other venues, and now possess enough name recognition to get a
production off the ground. They are doing what they love, they have
the time and wherewithal to do it, and they're introducing audiences
to the pleasures of the theater.</TE>
<TE>   PBS is on a similar mission. According to Kinberg, "We're taking
you into theater in a very deliberate way so that a broader audience
can share the theater experience. And we don't pretend that it is
anything else. It is what it is. So we don't aim to make it less
theatrical."</TE>
<TE>   Which is to say that the show's broad acting style--it's played
almost as a farce--hasn't been toned down for television.</TE>
<TE>   Tilly was worried about the cast shortchanging the live audience
by pulling back for the cameras. In fact, she says, the filming
suppressed the cast's natural impulse to let it all hang out at the
end of a run and may have inhibited audiences too. In other words, it
seemed to enhance the play's dramatic qualities (to the benefit of
Nixon, whose role is essentially straight) while tamping down some of
the comedy (to the detriment of Coolidge, whose marvelous turn as a
bovine socialite doesn't come across in quite the same way).</TE>
<TE>   The last four performances were filmed, although only the final
two were used, the first two being technical run-throughs. Ten fixed
cameras were deployed. The stage lighting was altered because it was
too "hot," or bright, for the cameras. The actresses were fitted with
radio mikes, a considerable feat given how many costume changes there
were (or not: Tilly's mike was hidden in her wig during the bathroom
scene). There will be nips and tucks in the final product to
accommodate the allotted air time. Jason Alexander is the host and
interviews the principal actresses during intermission.</TE>
<TE>   None of this necessarily interferes with the TV viewer's
theatrical experience. What may get in the way is the decision to cut
between characters. All those cameras were busily trained on
actresses talking and reacting, but not necessarily in the same
frame. There are few, if any, wide-angle proscenium shots.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that television can give you is focus," Kinberg
says. "When you're in a theater, you're at the mercy of the actors
and the director in terms of focus. But we get to decide that for
you, which can be very helpful. It can add clarity to a production.
So there are reaction shots in the production. As soon as you put a
camera on somebody, you're offering a point of view. Every form has
its--I hate to use the word 'constriction'--every form has its rule,
and we use cameras."</TE>
<TE>   Which leads, inevitably, back to Tilly's bathtub scene. Her big
moment was actually shot between performances in an empty theater,
with Tilly's back to the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over and done, but I still wake up in the middle of the
night going, 'Maybe I shouldn't have stood up,' " Tilly says. "It was
what it was, and that's the great thing about theater. It's something
that people remember in their heads." As for filming it, she adds,
laughing, "I didn't want them to, but they didn't want to either."</TE>

<HD>She's Ready (She Says)</HD>
<DH>Mexico's Paulina Rubio dearly wants to be a pop star here.
Does she have what it takes?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paulina Rubio takes an absent-minded bite of a glazed Krispy Kreme
and gazes at her picture on the cover of Cosmopolitan en Espanol. The
Mexican pop singer studies her image with the fascination of a
storybook character wondering who's the fairest of them all.</LD>
<LD>   Here, backstage at the Shrine Auditorium where she's about to
rehearse a dance routine for her new English-language single, "Don't
Say Goodbye," Rubio doesn't look at all like the voluptuous sex
kitten of her revealing, titillating celebrity photos. She's
surprisingly small and skinny, her jeans and white blouse fitting
loosely on her bony frame.</LD>
<LD>   The truth about her fleshy curves suddenly comes into focus:
Paulina, the sexpot pinup adored by fans on a first-name basis, is
largely a creation of camera angles.</LD>
<TE>   In the Cosmo photo, Rubio assumes the lusty pose of a
self-confident temptress, a hint of wildness in her tiger-striped
blouse, her wraparound suede skirt with the cave-girl cut, and
especially in her exotic, feline eyes. Her look says she knows what
she wants, a statement punctuated by a tousled mound of hair
cascading down her shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this because this is my mom's hair," says the daughter of
Mexican actress Susana Dosamantes. "Very Barbarella. Very '60s."</TE>
<TE>   Rubio laughs, then makes a motion like cracking a whip, relishing
the role of Wonder Woman taming the savage beast.</TE>
<TE>   She's come a long way from the cute child star who was Mexico's
sweetheart in the 1980s. She sang of puppy love as part of the
teeny-bopper group Timbiriche, a product of Televisa, then Mexico's
media monopoly. For almost a decade, from pre-adolescence to
womanhood, Rubio and the group were like a Latin Brady Bunch for kids
of that generation, who grew up along with their TV idol.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Rubio stood out for her bouncy energy on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Since going solo in the early 1990s, Rubio has starred
occasionally in Spanish soap operas but has struggled to find an
adult audience for her music. In interviews, she repeatedly proclaims
herself a citizen of the world with global concerns from littering to
nuclear proliferation. Yet she sings mostly lightweight stuff made to
fit radio formats, not fight for social change. She promotes herself
as a liberated woman and committed feminist, yet brazenly sells
herself as a sexual object.</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised in an environment in which women were always the
ones who pulled the family through," says Rubio, who is scheduled to
perform at Saturday's Wango Tango concert at the Rose Bowl. "The
stereotype of the Mexican woman as fragile, full of children and
powerless has completely disappeared. I believe I am a woman with a
strong character who knows the value of discipline and decisiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Those traits take on even more importance now as Rubio attempts to
become the next Latin artist to crack the coveted crossover market in
the U.S. Her new English-language album, "Border Girl," is scheduled
for release June 18, the day after her 31st birthday.</TE>
<TE>   If she succeeds, Rubio will be the first Mexican performer to make
the great leap into the English-language pop market. Most of her
crossover colleagues--Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias, Gloria
Estefan--have been East Coast Latinos with Caribbean or Iberian
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio, who last year had the biggest-selling Latin album in the
U.S., "Paulina," arrives in the wake of the astonishing success of
Shakira, the Colombian spitfire who proved language was not a barrier
to crossing musical boundaries. Unlike Marc Anthony or Iglesias,
raised as bilingual Hispanic Americans, Shakira had to teach herself
English before writing the songs for "Laundry Service," her crossover
album that has sold 2.4 million units in the U.S. alone.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that Shakira made it seem like a cinch.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, it looked as if Latinos had a crossover road map. Get
the backing of a multinational record label, assemble a team of
seasoned producers and writers, hire a hotshot manager (Freddy DeMann
of Madonna fame in Shakira's case), get a powerhouse radio station
like KIIS-FM to give your strategy a jump-start, make the talk-show
rounds with your charming accent ... and voila, another Latino
superstar climbs the Hot 100.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the hard part comes in making music that millions will
want to buy. For a seasoned artist such as Rubio, crossing over can
be like starting over.</TE>
<TE>   "You walk a fine line," says Jerry Blair, a former Columbia
Records executive who's working on Rubio's team as a consultant to
Universal. "You just want to broaden the artist's appeal while still
staying true to her fans who love her music that she's made up until
now."</TE>
<TE>   In the past few years, Rubio has taken all the steps to get ready
for this moment.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, she left her longtime label, EMI, where she had
floundered during the past decade with four lackluster albums. Her
move to Universal yielded the smash hit she needed to be seriously
considered a crossover candidate. Released in 2000 after a four-year
recording hiatus, "Paulina" was produced by the production company of
super-hot songwriter Estefano and has sold more than 2 million
worldwide, according to the label.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio then parted company with the architect of that lucrative
label deal, her longtime manager in Mexico, Dario de Leon, who urged
her not to neglect old fans in favor of new ones. Less than a year
ago, she jumped to the Puerto Rico-based management team of Angelo
Medina and Ricardo Cordero, who helped shepherd Ricky Martin's
career.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes her special?" asks Cordero. "Her spontaneity, her
joyful spirit, her intelligence, her drive and her whole way of
life--marked by perseverance, hard work and devotion to her
vocation."</TE>
<TE>   Rubio will need all the motivation she can muster, says Cordero,
as she tries to conquer new markets in the U.S. and Europe while
tending to her existing base. Latin fans and Latin radio programmers
could defect if they interpret Rubio's quest for English acceptance
as a cultural betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Some artists like Marc Anthony dismiss the very idea of crossover,
arguing that they were born bicultural and perform naturally in both
languages. But the record industry certainly believes in the concept,
developing specific strategies to help artists "cross over" from one
market to another, be it from country to pop or Spanish to English.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio now faces the inevitable comparisons with Latin performers
who preceded her on that crossover road. So how does she measure up?</TE>
<TE>   Artistically, the Golden Girl pales against her competition.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't have Marc Anthony's powerful voice, Martin's
sensational dance moves or Shakira's respected songwriting skills.
She doesn't have J. Lo's body or the cosmopolitan appeal of Julio
Iglesias.</TE>
<TE>   So what does Rubio have going for her?</TE>
<TE>   She's got that fire in the belly, a relentless drive to succeed
against the odds.</TE>
<TE>   It's an inner strength and conviction that have made survivors of
the Dosamantes women, says Rubio, who was born in Mexico City and now
has homes there, in Miami and Barcelona. Her role model is her
grandmother, a strong, turn-of-the-20th century woman who, she
recalls, was widowed at 17 yet emerged, after having sacrificed an
opera career, as the provider for her eight younger siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why she supported my mother's career," says Rubio,
casually biting her fingernail. "And that's why my mother supported
me."</TE>
<TE>   Although she has not married and has no children, Rubio has
maintained a longtime relationship with Ricardo Bofill Jr.,
ex-husband of Chabeli Iglesias, Enrique's sister. Their relationship,
started when the Spanish architect and aspiring filmmaker was still
married, caused an international scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in marriage," she told a Madrid celebrity
magazine earlier this year. "My parents divorced very young, and I
don't want to fail in the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Rubio says her music has always been focused on her feminist
message of independence aimed at young, modern women. But you
wouldn't know it from the new album's sappy, lovesick songs with
titles such as "I'll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)" and "Casanova"
("You're the center of my obsession," goes one line). Almost all the
tunes, contributed by a variety of writers, project an old-fashioned,
pre-liberated girl whose essence is tied up in getting or keeping a
man.</TE>
<TE>   In "Border Girl," she sings:</TE>
<TE>   I was lost, now I'm found</TE>
<TE>   And baby in your arms I'm on solid ground....</TE>
<TE>   Every step that I take is to you</TE>
<TE>   I'd go anywhere you want me to.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, at the height of her Latin album's popularity, Rubio
told an interviewer for the Spanish edition of Rolling Stone that she
didn't care what men thought of her because "men feel threatened by
successful women, and that's why we have machismo." She hoped to
create a sense of community with women through her music, she
explained.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that article was accompanied by overtly and aggressively
sexual photographs of her, including a cover in which she's wearing
only the guitar on her back, and an inside spread of her topless,
clutching her breasts and wearing red panties labeled "PUNK."</TE>
<TE>   In person, Rubio exhibits a sweeter seductiveness. During an
interview in a dressing room at the Shrine, she sometimes cocks her
head to the side, toying with her long, curly strands of dirty blond
hair. Sometimes she intimately touches a questioner's knee.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio has the sort of worldly, pouty-lipped beauty of a Brigitte
Bardot, but she's no dumb blond. She's quick-witted, switching
between Spanish and English as she impatiently anticipates questions,
a sharp-tongued defense always at the ready. Her Spanish can be
coarse, peppered with the well-placed, rapid-fire profanities common
to the street talk of Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio is an avowed admirer of Madonna and invites comparisons to
the Material Girl's daring sexual persona. But her concept of erotica
is not always as complex as Madonna's elaborate psychosexual dramas,
with their sacrilegious images and Catholic bad-girl guilt.</TE>
<TE>   For Rubio, sexuality on stage is sometimes simply a matter of
being naughty and lifting up her skirt to show the audience her
underwear, as she did during the "Navidad Con KLVE" show in December
at the Wiltern Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "And you didn't like it?" Rubio shoots back sharply before a
question is even posed.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that it could be construed as a cheap thrill for
her fans, designed to distract from her lip-synced vocals at that
show.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, maybe I'm cheap sometimes. I don't care," says Rubio,
occasionally slouching in the couch, her sharply pointed boots on the
table. "Whoever doesn't like it, well too bad. I'm not going to
change because of anyone. On stage, I feel free to do whatever I want
to do ... I feel like a fish in water."</TE>
<TE>   She reconsiders. In fact, she doesn't even believe in the word
"cheap," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Then how would she characterize teasing the audience by exposing
her underwear?</TE>
<TE>   "Natural," answers Rubio, without missing a beat.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage at the Shrine, more magazines are circulating featuring
Rubio on the cover. There's Miami's Ocean Drive and there's People en
Espanol, which dubbed her one of the world's most beautiful Latinas.</TE>
<TE>   "Cover girl, cover girl, cover girl!" exclaims Rubio's publicity
agent, holding up the magazines and delighting in the orgy of fresh
press.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we now have a Cover Girl contract?" asks Rubio, musing about
her new cosmetic endorsement possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   On a video monitor, she sees her dancers out on the stage, already
rehearsing what is to be the opening number of the Alma Awards, a
program honoring Latinos in the arts that aired earlier this month on
ABC.</TE>
<TE>   "Ay, ay, I need to be there," she says, with the concern of a
mother hen.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio makes her way onto the stage, then down the steps into the
theater where her staff and the show's production crew occupy a few
rows in the center. She soon makes a joking aside to her manager
about the interview question that seems to have gotten under her
skin. "He says I'm cheap because I show my panties," Rubio kids, "but
he doesn't know how much they cost."</TE>
<TE>   No comment from the staff.</TE>
<TE>   The star slouches in a seat, popping a Coke can and munching on
Doritos. She flips through her magazine coverage and keeps one eye on
the stage action.</TE>
<TE>   The dance routine at one point calls for Rubio to come down into
the audience and grab a muscular young man from the front row. He
appears to be a hapless fan taken by the hand back to the stage, but
he then goes into a dazzling breakdance bit. Rubio's choreographer,
filling in for her during the first run-throughs, uses only the steps
on one side of the stage to go get the breakdancer and return.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio sees a better way.</TE>
<TE>   "I can make it more exciting," whispers Rubio in Spanish to her
manager. ("Yo la hago mas de emocion.")</TE>
<TE>   For the show, dressed in skimpy short-shorts and a revealing top,
Rubio goes down the other side of the stage, then marches
dramatically back across the entire front row like a tigress on the
prowl. She stops to get her man, extending her arm on the beat with a
commanding snap to her wrist, like cracking a whip.</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple change that makes a big difference in magnifying the
impact of her performance, which could have been overshadowed by the
male dancer.</TE>
<TE>   "That was easy," she says when asked about making the change.</TE>
<TE>   Easy if you were born to be Barbarella.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It seems fitting that San Diego billionaire Irwin M. Jacobs, a former
university professor who built his fortune from digital wireless
communications technology, would communicate the stunning news via
e-mail:</LD>
<LD>   "The amount we have in mind is $100 million."</LD>
<LD>   Symphony executive director Douglas Gerhart cried when he found
the Dec. 26 missive in his e-mail when he stopped by his office over
the holidays. He knew that Jacobs, 68-year-old founder and chief
executive of Qualcomm Inc., and his wife, Joan, 69, planned to make a
sizable gift to the symphony--"but I dared not dream of $100
million," the largest single donation ever made to a symphony
orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   Gerhart did not tell anyone about the e-mail for a few days. "It
was such an enormous, life-changing event for the San Diego Symphony,
and I wanted to process it for a while," he admits. "I needed a few
days to absorb it and celebrate it very privately."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of other symphony supporters spilled tears in their
champagne when Gerhart made the announcement Jan. 14, before a
gathering of about 1,500 people at Copley Symphony Hall. "People I
did not even know came up to me with tears in their eyes, talking
about how they dreamed of a day like this one," Gerhart says.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra closed the ceremony by playing Dvorak's "New World"
Symphony, one of Irwin Jacobs' favorite pieces and certainly apt for
the moment. Although the gift will be made over time--$5 million a
year for 10 years, followed by a $50-million bequest--when all the
money's in the bank, the donation will result in The San Diego
Symphony, with an annual budget of $8.8 million, sitting atop an
endowment about twice that of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which has
an operating budget of about $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Jacobses also plan to donate $2 million annually for orchestra
operations during the next 10 years, raising their total contribution
to $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as jaw-dropping as the gift might be, the donation
represents neither the first chapter--nor the last--in the story of
the San Diego Symphony. Just six years ago, the orchestra found
itself in the midst of a very different chapter: Chapter
11--bankruptcy--forced the organization to shut down for two years
beginning in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was that the first time the orchestra had faced financial
disaster. Although the board of directors stopped short of filing for
bankruptcy, the San Diego Symphony ceased operations in 1987 to raise
money to pay off its many creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written in the press about the orchestra's Chapter
11 filing--but little about how it was able to come back to life,
four years before the Jacobs donation made philanthropic history.
Symphony officials and the Jacobses themselves describe their
donation as the result, rather than the cause, of the orchestra's
rebirth.</TE>
<TE>   Call this story Chapter 12: the tale of how, from the 1996
bankruptcy to the symphony's rebirth in 1998, the musicians, the
community, a key $2-million donor, local politicos and a popular
thirtysomething conductor with innovative--some call them
crazy--ideas rallied to save The San Diego Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   How do you bankrupt a symphony orchestra? The same way you
bankrupt any other business: Spend more money than you've got.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the San Diego Symphony, the number of opinions on
how black turned to red is roughly equal to the number of people you
ask. Chalk it up to some combination of weak board leadership, faulty
management, a slate of expensive guest artists, and an aggressive
audience-building campaign that slashed ticket prices but ate into
potential revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Although a symphony goes bankrupt just like any other business,
the game of rebuilding a nonprofit arts organization must be played
by different rules. This is especially true of a symphony
orchestra--because no matter what the financial constraints, a
symphony still needs the same number of musicians to be a symphony.
You can't save the company by laying off the string section.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is further complicated by musicians' union contracts
and audience expectations: An orchestra must commit to an annual
season of performances, eliminating flexibility in matching supply to
demand.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the San Diego Symphony's bankruptcy is typical,
observes Charles Olton, chief executive and president of the American
Symphony Orchestra League, a New York-based service organization. "I
think that the success of a nonprofit organization is fundamentally
dependent on the quality of leadership," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Olton says statistics refute the common misconception that
orchestras are closing in mass numbers because the classical music
audience is dying off. Actually, the audience for classical music has
never been bigger, according to the league's statistics. It reports
that 32 million people attended a symphony concert in 2001, up from
27 million 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Olton says that only 10 major orchestras among the league's
900-orchestra membership have gone bankrupt in the past 15 years. He
adds that many of the orchestras that went bankrupt have regrouped
and come back to life. Some cities that lost orchestras to financial
difficulties formed new organizations with new names: Kansas City
Philharmonic, for example, dissolved in 1982, to be replaced by a new
orchestra, Kansas City Symphony, later that year.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the Sacramento Symphony folded in 1995 and was
never revived. But another local orchestra, the Sacramento
Philharmonic, was formed in 1997, with a different administration
and, for the most part, different musicians. The financially troubled
San Jose Symphony announced on Tuesday that it will go dark for an
estimated six to 18 months, beginning Saturday, for reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Although the league's Olton says the symphony orchestra world
remains generally healthy, he acknowledges that unique challenges
face an orchestra in its quest for survival.</TE>
<TE>   Because it relies on donations as much as earned income, an
orchestra must win the support of the community. It also must be
financially sound. Orchestra donors must believe they're not throwing
good money after bad, and that their dollars can be leveraged into
future gifts--a particularly difficult sell for a strife-ridden
orchestra that has already closed its doors twice.</TE>
<TE>   It took that kind of reassurance for the Jacobses, longtime donors
to the San Diego Symphony, to finally commit to the impressive sum of
$120 million.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that has always been important for us is: What
kind of acceptance is there in the city?" Irwin Jacobs said in an
interview at his office at Qualcomm headquarters in San Diego. On the
table next to him is one of the latest innovations using Qualcomm
technology, the camera phone--already being sold in the Far East and
due in the U.S. in about six months.</TE>
<TE>   Framed on one wall hangs a cartoon that ran in the San Diego
Union-Tribune: a musical score bearing the title "The San Diego
Symphony Endowment Sonata by Irwin and Joan Jacobs." The musical
notes are replaced with little dollar signs.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the musical community celebrates their donation, Irwin and
Joan Jacobs point to an earlier, more modest gift to the San Diego
Symphony--$2 million from local businessman Larry Robinson in
1997--as the first step in building the confidence necessary for them
to sign that very large check.</TE>
<TE>   There was another brief chapter in the symphony's history just
before Chapter 11--Chapter 7. On May 31, 1996, the symphony filed for
Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which would have called for the liquidation of
all of the orchestra's assets to pay off creditors.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 31, 1997, that bankruptcy was converted to Chapter
11--under which the organization is relieved of the immediate
pressure to sell assets, allowing for the possibility of
reorganization. The change was made possible largely through the
efforts of Robinson, who was determined to save the symphony despite
what he calls stiff opposition from some San Diego community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   One of the symphony's valuable assets was Copley Symphony Hall,
formerly the Fox Theater, a 1929 French Rococo-style movie house
given to the symphony in 1984. Another was the orchestra's music
library.</TE>
<TE>   In dollars, the sheet music used by the orchestra is worth
somewhere between $100,000 and $300,000, but to the musicians, the
library is invaluable. "It's the heartbeat of the orchestra," says
the symphony's librarian, Nancy Fisch. "All the music has the
markings of the musicians on it, the fingerings and bowings for the
strings; if they play the flute, where they take their breaths. All
of this is missing when you buy new music."</TE>
<TE>   The music also contains corrections, as well as marks and notes
made by noteworthy music directors and guest directors, and often
their valuable signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Those involved in the decision-making--including a mayor's task
force of musicians, orchestra officials and community
leaders--describe the debate between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 as long
and contentious. While both sides believed that San Diego needed an
orchestra, some believed that goal could best be accomplished by
starting over with a completely new organization.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including donor Robinson, saw things differently.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, Robinson, who was to become the orchestra's chief
financial savior, did not get involved with the orchestra until just
after the bankruptcy. An old acquaintance, former UCLA music
professor Jack Wheaton, had been named president of the musicians'
union serving San Diego, and invited Robinson to lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a fan of the symphony but certainly not a regular
participant," Robinson said. "But that started my curiosity as to why
the organization had slipped into bankruptcy, and why it was so
desperate." As a result, a few weeks later, Wheaton invited Robinson
to a meeting of the symphony's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "I listened to these people for an hour or so and said, 'This is
hopeless,' " Robinson recalled by telephone from his home in Rancho
Santa Fe. "These people were in a very bad mind-set--their lawyers
had persuaded them that all they could do is file a Chapter 7
bankruptcy, which is a liquidation.</TE>
<TE>   "My background is law, though I haven't practiced law for a long
time, and my simplistic notion was that things didn't have to be so
absolute. The lawyers were setting about to sell the assets.... I
said, 'If the die is cast, there won't be anything left to
resuscitate.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robinson came up with this idea: He would donate $2 million to the
orchestra to pay off outstanding bank loans. The banks had agreed to
partially forgive the debts if some portion was paid.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson would also purchase Copley Symphony Hall for about
$100,000. He didn't plan to keep it--just to provide a safety net
against creditors in case the financially fragile symphony suffered
another bankruptcy. He plans to eventually deed the building back to
the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson says some members of the mayor's committee--including
then-Mayor Susan Golding--fought his plan at every turn. (Golding did
not return calls for comment.) He still sounds wounded when he
recalls those days: "I felt utterly isolated and alone."</TE>
<TE>   Others involved in the situation, including Irwin Jacobs, describe
the conflict as a simple difference of opinion. In either event,
Robinson's plan won out.</TE>
<TE>   Symphony observers are unanimous on this point, however:
Robinson's plan would not have worked without the cooperation of the
musicians, who went unpaid for weeks before the bankruptcy but
remained ready to support the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of this has to be the willingness of a lot of the musicians
to stick around and hope," says Jim Plank, a symphony percussionist
since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   "There were financial pressures; a few people took jobs with other
orchestras," Plank says. "When the orchestra resumed, there were some
different faces there, no question--but a surprisingly large number
of the same faces, given the length of time."</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of that sort of leniency in the community, says
Judge Louise Adler, who presided over the bankruptcy. "I wasn't
pushing it very hard, because I thought that the stages of grief, if
you will, had to be gone through in order for people to realize it
was worth trying again," she says. "No one was pushing, the creditors
weren't pushing--and of course the biggest constituency of creditors
was the musicians themselves."</TE>
<TE>   After Robinson's donation, other donors, including the Jacobses,
rallied to contribute the additional several million needed to launch
a comeback season in 1998--beginning with a series of outdoor summer
pops concerts at Navy Pier, followed by concert series at Copley
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's donation "was the key gift in getting things started,
keeping the hall, keeping the music library intact--and, to us,
indicating that there was other support around the city," Irwin
Jacobs said. Adds Joan: "That was very important to us; we had begun
to feel that we were the only ones who thought it was important
enough."</TE>
<TE>   "If we had failed, it certainly would have secured the idea that a
symphony could not exist in San Diego. We only had one shot at this,"
Jung-Ho Pak says.</TE>
<TE>   Pak, 40, recently completed his final season as artistic director
of the symphony; he announced his resignation last March, saying he
wanted to pursue other opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   But for the last six years--including the two the symphony went
dark, the young Californian led an aggressive campaign to update the
orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony needed more money--but Pak insists that equally
important to its rebirth was a new marketing approach. While the
orchestra continued to rely on traditional programming, Pak's reign
broke with tradition in terms of presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Pak was 34 when the symphony went bankrupt. He had served for
about a year as assistant conductor to Yoav Talmi. From 1996 to 1998,
Pak remained based in San Diego while continuing his other
commitments as music director of New Haven Symphony in Connecticut
and in academic posts at USC and the San Francisco Conservatory of
Music. At the same time, he served as the volunteer champion of the
San Diego Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing experience to see such a major city lose an
orchestra," Pak observes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were struggling with a tremendous amount of distrust and
disdain. One of my first jobs was to go out in public and speak at
every Rotary Club, every women's group, and just tell my story, over
and over.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of orchestras believe they have a right to exist. Having
watched an orchestra go through a bankruptcy, I don't believe that at
all," Pak continues. "I believe an orchestra has to continually prove
its relevance."</TE>
<TE>   Once the symphony had the money to start back up, Pak says there
was still much work to be done to update the orchestra. One technique
involved rigging rock-concert-style video screens at Copley Symphony
Hall. "I created a special video element within the show each
week--we'd bring in a three-camera, in-house video team, so at
intermission you would see an up-close interview with the guest
artist," Pak says. "I think that's the future of the performing arts;
we have to use every tool in our arsenal to try to reach the
audience."</TE>
<TE>   Among Pak's pet projects was the Light Bulb series, which employed
a variety of nontraditional means to help audiences connect with the
music. Pak frequently invited leaders from nonmusical fields to
appear with the orchestra. One concert, titled "The French
Connection," brought a French chef on stage to cook, illustrating
some of the parallels between food and music. For a Halloween
concert, Pak invited the county coroner to conduct "Dance of the
Dead" from Gounod's "Funeral March of the Marionettes." Copley Hall
was decorated as a haunted house.</TE>
<TE>   The Jacobses remain good-naturedly skeptical about some of Pak's
onstage stunts (the technology-minded couple likes the video screens,
comparing them to the use of supertitles to translate opera into
English), but symphony officials say that Pak's nontraditional
approach helped increase attendance at pops concerts as well as the
orchestra's regular season of classical fare.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's why public opinion changed; the endowment gift was
a byproduct of how the Jacobses saw that a city could finally love an
orchestra," Pak says. "If we had not been successful in terms of
turning around people's perception of the symphony, garnered larger
audiences, garnered younger audiences--I don't think they would have
jumped into the deep waters of an endowment."</TE>
<TE>   Pak's decision to leave the San Diego Symphony was announced
months before the Jacobses' gift--and he says it would not have
changed his mind. He chose to leave partly because of the fatigue
caused by his multiple careers--and a 3-year-old daughter--and partly
because "I had a vision of creating an even more theatrical and
dramatic experience with classical music. I'd like to try that with a
different kind of an organization--the model of a symphony orchestra
is surprisingly corporate. I'm still a dreamer, I'm still an
entrepreneur. I'm still as crazy as ever."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego is the nation's seventh largest city. While the American
Symphony Orchestra League does not provide specific rankings for
orchestras based on either budget or musical reputation, the
organization confirms that, in budget, the San Diego Symphony ranks
in its second tier--meaning that it falls somewhere between the 25th
and 40th largest orchestra in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Its musical status is less easily assessed--but even supporters
acknowledge that the San Diego Symphony is not yet a world-class
orchestra. "Heard often over the past three decades, the San Diego
ensemble remains promising--and no more," wrote Times reviewer Daniel
Cariaga of the orchestra's first winter concert in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   While many of its musicians returned after the bankruptcy, some of
the most talented left the city to join other major musical groups.
Observers believe it will take 10 years to see whether the Jacobses'
donation launches the orchestra's operating budget and artistic
reputation into the same rank as the city's population.</TE>
<TE>   On the management side, board members and staff seem to have
confidence in Gerhart, hired two years ago after turning around
bankrupt orchestras in Birmingham, Ala., and Tulsa, Okla. Gerhart is
an executive cautious enough about the future that he has announced
the $100-million gift as the halfway point toward a campaign to raise
an endowment of $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Jacobses' operating-budget donations will allow for staff
expansion, and new office space, and aid in the symphony's plan to
rebuild its stage floor--a $480,000 undertaking approved before the
donation was in place.</TE>
<TE>   Artistic progress may take a little longer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a superb gift that will give the symphony the financial
underpinning to focus on making art, developing a fine orchestra and
getting a good music director," says Ian Campbell, general director
of San Diego Opera. "I think a decade from now, and it will take that
long, we will have a very high-quality symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anybody who thinks money solves artistic issues overnight
is crazy, because orchestras are made up of people," he adds. "But
because the symphony will be more stable, they will attract many good
candidates every time a vacancy occurs."</TE>
<TE>   Although the change won't happen overnight, it could happen more
quickly than the usual replacement-by-attrition. Currently,
substitutes fill 28 of 79 positions. The plan is to fill those slots
with permanent members after a new music director is appointed to
approve the new hires.</TE>
<TE>   The donation should allow the symphony to entice a more attractive
candidate for the job. Warren Kessler, a San Diego urologist who is
past chairman and a former symphony board member, is heading up the
search committee, and says the process could take more than a year.
In the interim, Kessler says, potential candidates will be invited to
join the orchestra as guest conductors.</TE>
<TE>   Guests in recent and upcoming concerts include Daniel Hege, music
director of New York's Syracuse Symphony Orchestra; David Robertson,
music director of France's National Orchestra of Lyon; and Miguel
Harth-Bedoya, associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   The current musicians' contract expires in 2006 and calls for the
gradual expansion of the season from 26 work weeks to 41. The
contract also raises base salaries from $25,950 to $45,750. That
security should make the orchestra more competitive in attracting top
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what it means is that the community will start looking at
the symphony differently," says Richard Levine, orchestra cellist
since 1973. "Everyone won't have to preface everything they say about
the symphony with 'financially troubled'; we can be the San Diego
Symphony."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin and Joan Jacobs firmly agree. "The whole mix of the
population is changing. We're not a Navy town anymore," Joan says.
"And people are retiring here; they're coming from the East where
they are accustomed to going to the symphony."</TE>
<TE>   With a wink, Irwin makes a reference to Qualcomm Stadium, the
city-owned facility that was renamed in 1997 after Jacobs' company
agreed to pay $18 million to complete an expansion project. "Some
people think it's more important to have a stadium, or whatever. But
it's amazing how many people have written to us and said that they're
so happy that the symphony is going to be stable, and that it will be
here for many years to come."</TE>
<TE>   He adds that he hopes the donation will help lure a new music
director of the stature of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Esa-Pekka
Salonen and San Francisco Symphony's Michael Tilson Thomas. "If we
have three here in California, people are going to have to rethink
their whole idea of culture out here," he says. "That's good
competition to have."</TE>

<HD>Why Pay to See Our Own Art?</HD>
<DH>LACMA was once free to the public--and should be again.
It's economically feasible and would deepen our museum experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In August 1978, facing a drastic cut in its budget in the wake of
passage of the tax-slashing Jarvis-Gann Initiative, Proposition 13,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art began charging a general
admission fee. Before, LACMA had been free. Now it would begin to
charge $1.50 for an adult to come through the door.</LD>
<LD>   Within a month, attendance slid by 44%. Early the next year, The
Times reported LACMA figures showing that the average number of daily
visitors to the museum's galleries had plummeted from 1,400 to 370.
Fourteen hundred daily visitors had meant an annual attendance of
just under a half-million--a pretty healthy number in a county with a
far-flung population then at 7.5 million. Initiating a general
admission fee plainly had a devastating effect.</LD>
<LD>   Today, more than two decades later, the county's population has
swelled to nearly 10 million. Where did attendance at LACMA stand for
the year 2001? According to a museum spokesman, it hovered just below
a half-million--roughly the same as it was 25 years ago, before the
general admission fee was put into place.</LD>
<TE>   Something is wrong with this picture. When you frame it with the
fact that LACMA today earns a trifling 3% of its annual operating
budget from general admissions, charging the fee seems just plain
dumb. As the region's population has exploded, the county's art
museum has made enormous strides in establishing its international
reputation through acquisitions, building expansion, exhibitions and
scholarship. But the number of people going through the door now
isn't much greater than it was when Jimmy Carter was in the White
House and "Annie Hall" copped the best picture Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Any museum professional will tell you that attendance figures are
notoriously slippery. Counting heads is an inexact science. One-time
visitors are different from repeat visitors. Attendance can be
artificially spiked.</TE>
<TE>   An example: In the months before Proposition 13, "Treasures of
King Tutankhamun," which launched the modern phenomenon of
blockbuster art museum shows, was so popular at LACMA that scalpers
were hawking special admission tickets on the sidewalk in front of
the Wilshire Boulevard museum.</TE>
<TE>   Other exhibitions with marquee value, like 1999's nearly
back-to-back Picasso and Van Gogh presentations, pushed LACMA's
attendance toward the 1-million mark. When the dust settled and the
program schedule returned to normal, so did attendance, which hovered
around half that 1999 peak in each of the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics are dodgy. And the quality of a museum experience
trumps quantity at any rate. Artistically, the Picasso and Van Gogh
exhibitions were undistinguished. Neither measured up to last year's
surprising "Purism in Paris, 1918-1925" or the first-ever survey of
Neapolitan Baroque painter Luca Giordano, which didn't have the
general public beating down the doors. Measuring success by
attendance figures is the art museum version of Nielsen ratings.
Commercial entertainment is mistaken for aesthetic value.</TE>
<TE>   Still, what happened a generation ago in the wake of Proposition
13 should not be forgotten. LACMA today is in the midst of pondering
the complicated launch of a massive capital campaign, whose goal is
expected to be at least $300 million. The money will be used to raze
the existing dysfunctional campus, construct an exciting new building
with the potential to be a civic landmark and enhance the rather
small endowment for operations and acquisitions by $100 million. As
the plan proceeds, one thing is clear: The general admission charge
has got to go.</TE>
<TE>   There might have been good reason for it in the fiscally uncertain
period after Proposition 13. Beyond force of habit, though, what
justification could be advanced now?</TE>
<TE>   It may seem shocking--even heretical--to assert that LACMA's list
of top priorities should include elimination of its general admission
fee. I would submit, though, that the sense of shock is itself a sign
of what has been lost.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between rich and poor has grown into a chasm in the United
States during the past 20 years, and much of L.A.'s population growth
since then has been at the poorest end of the economic spectrum. No
one should underestimate the barrier erected by general admission
fees.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the issue isn't just a matter of affordability. It also
concerns a more fundamental relationship with art. Once upon a time
public art museums were regarded as a civic service, whose closest
kin was a public library. Creating admission fees and hawking
membership categories that provide "free" visits changes the tenor of
the place. It becomes "their" museum, which "we" are invited to join.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly 130,000 paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings and
other works in LACMA's collection are actually like the books and
periodicals stored at the public library. They're not owned by the
museum's board of trustees or professional staff. The collection is
owned by the people of Los Angeles County--you and me--and currently
we are charged a fee to see the art we own.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to charge admission to see a special, temporary
exhibition. It's quite another to impose a fee on visiting the
museum's permanent collection. Imagine the pandemonium if the library
started to charge admission. Yet we've come to expect to pay to get
into the museum's galleries, just as we expect to pay for a movie, a
baseball game or another commercial entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   When adjusted for inflation, LACMA's original admission fee of
$1.50 translates into about $4.25 today. But LACMA now charges adults
$7 each. That's in line with many other large art museums around the
country and in Southern California, where the tariff ranges from $6
to $10. The cost of a ticket to a movie theater seems to be the
approximate benchmark.</TE>
<TE>   But do we have to pay? Is there really a critical need? Have
general admission fees to visit an art museum's permanent collection
galleries, as opposed to special exhibitions, simply become an
essential feature of civic life in the United States?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is no--at least, not everywhere. Many of America's art
museums are free to enter, and not just billionaire museums like the
Getty.</TE>
<TE>   There's Washington's National Gallery, of course, where admission
fees are forbidden by its federal charter. Ohio's great Cleveland
Museum of Art is also free, as is the exceptional Toledo Museum of
Art across the state. In Texas, the Contemporary Arts Museum and the
Menil Collection in Houston have no admission charge, and neither do
Fort Worth's Kimbell, Amon Carter and Modern Art museums. The
Minneapolis Institute of the Arts and the Saint Louis Art Museum are
free.</TE>
<TE>   The Saint Louis Museum's famous motto is even chiseled in stone
above the front door: "Dedicated to Art and Free to All."</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the San Jose Museum of Art abolished its admission fee.
Attendance doubled immediately--and has stayed that way.</TE>
<TE>   According to a San Jose spokesman, the change in entry status had
some unexpected consequences. The museum did expect membership in
lower-priced categories to dip--probably because they're often taken
out by museum regulars with tight incomes who want to avoid repeated
admission charges. And dip they did. But, surprisingly, memberships
in upper categories actually increased.</TE>
<TE>   How to explain it? The museum no longer just promotes membership
as a cost-effective discount plan to gain entry, but as a way to keep
admission free for everyone--an appeal that strengthens the social
fabric. Committed members stepped up to the plate. Total revenue from
memberships, which accounts for about 6% of the museum's annual
budget, remained steady.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose museum also found corporate sponsors to help
underwrite free admission. The Packard Foundation offered a
one-to-one challenge grant of $100,000; in 24 hours, it had been
matched--three to one. Underwriting proved to be an attractive
corporate gesture, even in a region experiencing significant economic
difficulty in its battered high-tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   In Great Britain last fall, after four years of legislative
maneuvering, entrance fees were abolished at all national museums. In
five months, attendance nationwide rose 75%. The BBC reported that in
London alone, an extra 1.4 million visitors had poured through the
doors of the city's museums.</TE>
<TE>   When London's Tate Modern opened in May 2000 following a blaze of
international publicity, it became the most-visited art museum in the
world. With 5.25 million visitors in its first year, it had three
times the attendance of its nearest European rival, the newly
refurbished Pompidou Center in Paris. Admission to the Pompidou is
$9.25; Tate Modern is free.</TE>
<TE>   No two art museums are alike, of course. The San Jose Museum of
Art is a small, community-oriented facility with 5,000 members and a
$5-million budget. LACMA is a big, internationally recognized,
encyclopedic museum with 80,000 members and a $40.5-million annual
operating budget. The needs and aspirations of different museums vary
widely, and so do the range of enticing activities in different
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, anyone who has visited free art museums in Washington,
London, Toledo or St. Louis knows that the experience one has with
the permanent collection is qualitatively different. Looking at art
becomes more casual, less event-oriented. As museum-going is
integrated into daily life, a quiet thrill accompanies stepping
across the threshold. The ineffable sense of communal ownership of
cultural patrimony, which is essential to civilized society,
blossoms. It gets short-circuited by ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   When LACMA unveils a remarkable 18th century Spanish sculpture of
a Pieta that is the only one like it in any American museum, as it
did in March, you're more inclined to drive over for a look if
there's no admission fee. If there is--well, odds are you'll wait
until the next blockbuster before dipping into the permanent
collection galleries, or until you can spend a few hours to justify
the expense.</TE>
<TE>   That is, if you go at all. Art's pleasure dissolves when it gets
entangled with logistical hassles.</TE>
<TE>   Art museums might be nonprofit institutions, but every museum has
a bottom line. And that might be the most remarkable fact of all: We
are talking here about a relatively small amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   According to a LACMA spokesman, the scant 3 percent of its $40.5
million annual budget that derives from general admission fees
fluctuates slightly from year to year, but in 2001 it produced just
$1.2 million in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA officials have discussed the possibility of dropping the
fee, but no plan is presently in the works.</TE>
<TE>   If a cost-benefit analysis was to be performed on what has been
gained and lost in the last 25 years, surely LACMA would abolish
general admission tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>It Can Be Easy Building Green</HD>
<DH>An architect finds 13 buildings that are kind to the
environment</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LeTRAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Ten Shades of Green" at the Orange County Museum of Art,
architecture follows a new dictum: Form follows function--and global
survival.</LD>
<LD>   "Buildings are one of the biggest polluters of the environment,"
said guest curator Peter Buchanan, an independent London architect
and writer who proposed the show in response to the potential threat
of global warming. "Green design is building with a conscience," he
said.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty percent of energy consumed and greenhouse gases emitted in
the world are from buildings, Buchanan said, adding that the United
States alone contributes up to one-fourth of the planet's emissions.</LD>
<TE>   Promoting green building design has become an important cause for
the Architectural League of New York, an organization that presents
exhibits and public education programs on architecture and design.
The league accepted Buchanan's proposal and produced the 12-stop
traveling exhibition, which will continue on to Boston and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalie Genevro, league executive director, said Buchanan was
commissioned to guest-curate the show because he is a green issues
advocate and has broad appeal to technical and lay audiences.
Buchanan selected 13 buildings, based on aesthetics and environmental
friendliness. Most are European projects, and most were built within
the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition's title comes from the 10 criteria it establishes
for assessing greenness. Primary among them is energy efficiency: the
use of "natural" air-conditioning or solar heat, for example.
Buildings are also judged on their use of recycled materials and
renewable resources, and on the way they react to and operate in
their environments. Buchanan says one way to summarize green
principles is to think in terms of thermodynamics, the way heat can
be transferred into other kinds of energy and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Each project is represented by photographs, drawings and a scale
model in cross-section, which allows a visitor to see, for example,
how the University of Nottingham in England uses wind power and its
lakeside site to create a cooling system. The architects discuss
their projects on interactive computer displays.</TE>
<TE>   What's crucial to Buchanan is that these buildings accomplish
green goals without compromising style.</TE>
<TE>   "Green design is not a straitjacket," Buchanan said. "American
architects have complained that green buildings are ugly. We want to
show people that green architecture can be beautifully designed and
conceptually sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   In his view, the Commerzbank headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany,
has it all. Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the silvery
triangular structure is covered in reflective glass. It's 53
stories--the tallest skyscraper in Europe--and among its most
important green elements is an atrium, a hollow core that fills the
bank's offices with natural light from all sides while creating
better air circulation. Foster also added atrium "sky gardens" on
some floors to freshen the air and provide public gathering places.</TE>
<TE>   Another building in the exhibition, the Beyeler Foundation Museum
in Basel, Switzerland, is embedded in a park-like landscape. The
classical design by Renzo Piano features an all-glass roof and
perforated steel panels that control the natural lighting in the
galleries.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnaert Building in Utrecht, Netherlands, by the Dutch firm
Neutelings Riedijk Architecten, is a wave-like horizontal structure
made of insulated concrete. The building collects rainwater on the
roof, and the water drips into a pool in the building's central hall.
In the summer, the rainwater is used to cool the building. It is
pumped through a circulatory system, absorbing heat, which it then
releases on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Four homes are showcased in the exhibit: three in the United
States and the fourth in Nova Scotia. The Wescott/Lahar House in west
Marin County uses thick, well-insulated walls made of bales of straw
to conserve energy. The Cotulla Ranch House in La Salle County,
Texas, is built to recycle rainwater by collecting it in cisterns.
The Palmer House in Tucson manages temperature with thick walls, uses
native landscape and has an economical evaporative cooling system.
The Howard House in West Pennant, Nova Scotia, recycles local
materials, such as corrugated steel from boat sheds and barns.</TE>
<TE>   Why are most of the exhibition's projects from Europe? Genevro
says that in general, Europe is ahead of the curve on green design
because its natural resources are more limited and architects are
more aware of the problem and more motivated to find solutions. But,
she adds, an increasing number of U.S. buildings are beginning to
meet green standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The exhibition is consistent with our own mission," said Peter
Templeton, a program manager with the U.S. Green Building Council, a
nonprofit advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan's criteria are similar to those the council uses to
certify buildings. In the last two years, 20 buildings nationwide
have been granted green status and 350 others are being considered
for approval.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Santa Barbara, the Donald Bren School of Environmental
Science and Management,  designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca
Partnership, received one of the council's highest ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "The current interest of green design isn't a passing fad,"
Genevro said. "Our resources are limited, and we can't go on with the
sprawl and consumption of land the way we have been."</TE>

<LD>I'm a 72-year-old retired white male without a lot of understanding
or appreciation of rap music, much less any love for Eminem, based on
previous accounts I had read about him and his work. But after
reading Robert Hilburn's article ("Chilling Out--for Him," June 2), I
think I can see the good side of a young man I'd just about written
off as anyone I'd want to see, hear, meet or know.</LD>
<LD>   You have presented well some of his own substantial comments about
the artistry and thought that goes into rap, which a lot of us old
fogies have written off as frenzied drivel without taking the time to
understand it.</LD>
<LD>   The next time that I come into contact with anything connected
with this young man, I will look with interest, with an understanding
of the personal life experience, depth and purpose underlying his
words.</LD>

<HD>The Days of 'Blaxploitation'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As an African American actor, I found your article on the resurgence
of the "blaxploitation" genre interesting and unsettling ("Cinema
Soul Mates," by Anne Valdespino, May 26). The fact is, despite their
pretensions to "black empowerment," most of these movies were
laughably bad.</LD>
<LD>   Why would any truly creative person attempt to find inspiration
from such dreck when there are far more interesting, original and
noteworthy stories concerning the black experience in America that
have yet to be told?</LD>
<LD>   True, in the '70s white-run studios profited immensely from these
cheaply made films, but the implication in the article is that now,
some 30 years after the fact, it would be OK to do these types of
films again as long as black people are making the dough.</LD>
<TE>   Exploitation is exploitation. The thought of any studio having an
"urban division" to crank out such crap as a "producer" in your
article wistfully suggests is repulsive. The last thing any black
artist needs is to be placed in a ghettoized category in a system
where it is difficult enough to find quality work as it is.</TE>

<LD>Re "From Here to Cologne" (by Paul Brownfield, June 2): I am one of
several American screenwriters working in Germany for the past 10
years, with nine produced TV movies.</LD>
<LD>   While these "writers of a certain age" were collecting residual
checks every week, many of us working writers who were never accepted
in our own country wrote in Germany, France and elsewhere to make a
living. We don't have the benefits of residuals, "reparations" or the
WGA. We have to write to eat.</LD>
<LD>   Now your article has opened the floodgates for every mediocre
writer to get on the phone with anyone who sounds vaguely German. I
don't believe one can write German stories in Malibu by simply
changing the names to Heidi and Hans.</LD>
<TE>   But then, those cultural differences would require these writers
to actually live there, do the work or, worse yet, to think.</TE>

<LD>In response to Boris Menart's contention that, sans sampling, Moby is
"John Tesh," I direct Menart to listen to "Animal Rights" and see if
he thinks the comparison holds (Letters, May 26).</LD>
<LD>   For someone who purports to be from a record company, Menart
should know better than to judge an artist based on sound snatches he
may have heard on a TV commercial or only on one CD. Too many of
Moby's critics haven't taken the time to listen to his back catalog
and judge his work as a whole. They're content to jump on the "he
only samples" bandwagon. That would be akin to a person hearing only
"Eleanor Rigby" and saying the Beatles simply were only stealing from
the classical masters.</LD>

<LD>On behalf of film technicians everywhere, let me apologize to Jim
Bosche and to the many other Los Angeles residents who get routinely
disturbed by our work (Letters, May 26).</LD>
<LD>   When working, we try to keep in mind that wherever we film, we
will undoubtedly disturb (and often upset) residents who live near
our sets. We try to keep that to a minimum, but it happens. That's
not our goal, it's just a byproduct of making movies and television
shows.</LD>
<LD>   I am forever amazed, however, that residents of L.A. routinely
complain about film production. Would Bosche rather the lights in his
window were shining in a Vancouver window instead?</LD>
<TE>   Please try to learn to live with the occasional intrusion and be
glad that we have the business in our town. For our part, we'll try
to keep the noise down.</TE>
<TE>   RICK STRIBLING</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For about the past 100 years, Jim Bosche's neighborhood, the
executive producer's and every other neighborhood in L.A. have been
our movie back lot. No one is exempt. If you move to Akron, Ohio, you
can't complain about the smell of burning rubber. You live in L.A.,
the movie-television-commercial-making capital of the world. That's
what we do here, and it smells like jobs and money for thousands and
thousands of industry people. We film here. Love it or leave it!</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we need to show consideration to residents, but similarly,
these residents need to show consideration to the film industry (and
its revenue), which is being pushed out of L.A. by greed and
bureaucracy, lured by lower costs in Canada and other continents. I
regret that Bosch didn't receive notification. Apparently,
notification was posted in his lobby, with copies left with the
doorman for distribution. I am told the neighborhood association was
informed and compensated. The solution is not to ban filming or
demand money, but to work with the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp. (L.A.'s permitting entity) to keep filming in L.A.</TE>

<LD>In "Before the Critics Have Their Say" (by Victoria Looseleaf, June
2), Douglas Nielsen was quoted as saying, "Viola Farber said she
stopped choreographing because she couldn't decide whether to turn
left or right." Nielsen has either misquoted Farber or the quote was
taken out of context. I understand the point he is trying to make,
but Farber never stopped choreographing until shortly before her
death in December 1998.</LD>
<LD>   What she said was, "When I am working on a new dance, if I can't
decide whether to turn left or right, I stop choreographing for that
day."</LD>
<LD>   Farber choreographed two new works during the 1997-98 season and
performed in New York in 1998 until a month before she died at age
67. Something as insignificant as not being able to decide whether to
turn right or left would never have stopped her from choreographing.</LD>

<HD>A Long Career Moved by the Spirit</HD>
<DH>At 79, Marion Scott is still seeking that unexplainable
link connecting dance, dancer and viewer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to dancer-choreographer Marion Scott, who turns 80 next
month, "You can dance as long as you can move." These days, the
veteran performer--who over the years has undergone three hip
replacement surgeries and suffered debilitating depression--is
nothing if not true to her word.</LD>
<LD>   Coming off the high of receiving the Lester Horton Lifetime
Achievement Award in April, Scott is ready to unveil "Inspired by
Isadora," the sixth installment in a series she calls Spirit Dances.
Opening Friday for a three-night run at Highways Performance Space in
Santa Monica, the series was conceived in 1999 by Scott and a nucleus
of dancers. She directs the improvisatory concerts, and, oh yes, she
dances in most of the programs as well.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent weekday, Scott ushered a visitor into her 16th-floor
Westwood apartment, walking with a hint of a limp. She's tiny, just 5
feet, and dressed in dancer gear--black leggings and a tunic splashed
with color--with her long gray hair pulled back into a neat bun.</LD>
<TE>   The Spirit Dances series, she explains, is one expression of the
"if you can move, you can dance" idea, an attempt to connect dancer,
movement, theme and audience with as little as possible in between.</TE>
<TE>   "To do a real spirit dance is risky," Scott says. "It's not
knowing. You ask spirit in, and sometimes spirit doesn't come. But
when it works, the spirit goes to the audience and they're connected.
Each performance is different, making it always interesting and
direct."</TE>
<TE>   It's an apt process for a woman who, despite her dictum and her
self-proclaimed passion for dance, has had to dig deep to stay on her
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Scott says her muse came to her when she was 5 or 6, growing up in
Chicago. Her father managed a hotel, and her mother loved art and
music. One day in a dance class, she had a transformative
experience--and again, she uses the concept of spirit to explain it.
"A spirit came to me and told me I was beautiful," she says, her blue
eyes sharp and sparkling. "Before, I felt I was ugly. Suddenly I felt
like a whole other being."</TE>
<TE>   It set her course. As soon as she finished high school, she left
Chicago for New York City and a career in modern dance. She studied
with, among others, Jose Limon, Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. She
danced in Graham's company as well as with modern dance pioneers
Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman. She also was assistant to Helen
Tamiris, becoming a lead dancer in the Tamiris-Nagrin Company from
1959 to 1963.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the need to make her own dances led her to found
the Marion Scott Dance Company, which numbered up to 10 dancers
during the troupe's 20-year run. It was based in New York and known
for its innovative, boundary-pushing movements. In 1962 Dance
Observer magazine noted Scott's ability to excite an audience.
"Aftermath," it said, "was packed with emotional intensity." In 1963,
Scott was awarded the Doris Humphrey Fellowship at Connecticut
College, which was then the only existing award for modern dance
choreography.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the biggest honor at the time," Scott recalls. "I knew I
was on my way."</TE>
<TE>   While she was choreographing and running her company, Scott was
also managing a family. She married businessman Ivan Rosalesky, moved
to New Jersey and had two children, Lynn and Peter. But she never
stopped dancing--until her late 40s, when she was sidelined by
crippling arthritis in her hip. Forced to retire, she gave up her
company in 1968. It would be 17 years before she would perform again.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott didn't leave dance behind altogether. In 1969 she joined
UCLA's dance department as professor and resident choreographer. Her
children were in college, but Scott's husband wasn't ready to retire.
So she shuttled between the two coasts.</TE>
<TE>   While she was in academia, Scott's choreography continued to be
performed, and she created new work. As part of a university research
grant in 1983, she went to Bali to study masked dance. From this trip
came "Triune," which Scott mounted at various venues, including Royce
Hall, in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But she still couldn't perform. Her arthritis had worsened, and in
1972 she underwent her first hip replacement surgery, followed by a
second in 1975. She sought out massage therapy, and counseling for
depression. Finally, in 1985, she formed her second company, Visions
Inter-Arts and got herself back on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with my bad hip and depression, I began to think about how
to get back into dance, which was my life, my passion," Scott says.</TE>
<TE>   Visions, an all-women, multidisciplinary performance collective,
lasted three years and presented works by, among others, performance
artist Rachel Rosenthal, former Scott student Hae Kyung Lee and
Scott.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Times dance critic Lewis Segal wrote that a Scott solo on
a Visions program "developed from weighty groveling to buoyant
gestures of affirmation ... a statement of one woman's connection to
something beyond the personal."</TE>
<TE>   But soon Scott was again grappling with the continuing ravages of
arthritis. She retired from UCLA in 1986 and disbanded Visions a year
later. "My body was such a struggle," she says. "But you can learn
just by keeping going. In the mid-'90s I went to a performance by
[Japanese butoh dancer] Kazuo Ohno. He was 89 years old and wearing
shorts. He had a not good body, but when he moved I felt he had no
bones, no muscles, no limbs. It was a perfect spirit dance. The
audience wouldn't let him leave the stage."</TE>
<TE>   That night, Scott says, she realized she could return to the
stage. Contacting her former student Roberta Wolin-Manker, who became
her assistant and co-producer, she put together Spirit Dances. The
dancers change from program to program, although Wolin-Manker, Linda
Gold and Diane Takamine appear in most of them. The series has no
restrictions on age or body type, but does ask its participants to
have a willingness to invite the unknown--spirit--into the mostly
unstructured work.</TE>
<TE>   The programs, which take place about twice yearly, are often based
on themes. "The Crones" was about older women dancing; in another,
Scott revisited the impact of masks on movement.</TE>
<TE>   The current Spirit Dance is something of a departure in that it
was inspired by a person, Isadora Duncan, not a concept. It features
a video collage about Duncan, created by Allegra Fuller Snyder, and
four Duncan dances performed by third-generation Duncan dancer
Kathryn Cassis, whom Scott met by chance at a party.</TE>
<TE>   "I invited her to the studio and showed her some of Isadora's
dances," Cassis explains. "Marion thought it would be beneficial for
her dancers to try and feel how Duncan worked and moved."</TE>
<TE>   Scott, who has returned to teaching a monthly class, says she is
also trying to show that Duncan is still valid today. One work on the
program, choreographed and performed by Scott, is inspired by Duncan
and set to a Schubert song.</TE>
<TE>   The program for Spirit Dances 7 isn't set yet. But Scott says she
will continue to produce the series for as long as she can. "I'm
looking at my own mortality, but in the meantime it's wonderful to be
able to do what you love. You reach for the impossible. You never
make it," she adds, "but you always reach."</TE>

<HD>Riverside Band Gets a Boost From a British Friend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has Alan McGee done it again?</LD>
<LD>   First the maverick record executive anointed the Hives as rock's
next big thing by releasing a U.K. compilation drawn from the Swedish
band's two independent albums. The Hives became a sensation in
England, and the excitement traveled to the U.S., where Warner Bros.
Records recently snapped up the band.</LD>
<LD>   Now McGee has taken another band from an exotic,
off-the-beaten-track locale and compiled material from its two indie
albums for a release from his Poptones label. And interest in the
group is heating up.</LD>
<TE>   Another band from Scandinavia? Nope. This one's from ...
Riverside. With its edgy, rock-soul sound, the BellRays have
consistently been a top pick among Southern California rock-scene
insiders for years. Largely through touring, the quartet has sold
10,000 copies each of its last two albums, "Let It Blast" and "Grand
Fury," but the group had not been able to stir much interest on a
larger level.</TE>
<TE>   McGee believes that's about to change.</TE>
<TE>   "The BellRays have got off to a great start in the U.K. and are
now getting daytime radio play on [BBC] Radio 1," says McGee, who ran
the storied Creation label and discovered Oasis, among other acts.
"The U.K. has become once again the shop window for the world's new
rock music, as we have seen with the Hives, the White Stripes,
B.R.M.C. and the Strokes. It's for me the most vibrant and exciting
time in music for the last 25 years. The BellRays are poised in the
U.K. to be the next big band, [though] only time will tell."</TE>
<TE>   Singer Lisa Kekaula isn't counting on anything, but says the McGee
connection has changed the BellRays' lives, at least for the
immediate future. They've just gone to Japan for a week to do shows
with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, as well as to be filmed on tour
for a feature that will be broadcast on Japanese TV. They'll soon
head to England and Europe for a month that includes a high-profile
performance at McGee's new Death Disco Dance Club in London.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really weird when you're in the eye of the storm," Kekaula
says. "We now have these obligations, but I've still got to take my
daughter to school, so we have to reevaluate the way that everyday
life is."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she says, U.S. record executives are
reevaluating the BellRays. Since the Poptones collection, "Meet the
BellRays," came out last month, the band and its manager, Margaret
Saadi, have been fielding an increasing number of inquiries about its
label status.</TE>
<TE>   "Alan's involvement gives something a cool factor," says Tom
Sarig, MCA Records vice president of A&amp;R. "I don't know if it means a
damn about sales. He put a lot of stuff out on Poptones, but the
label was going under before the Hives. However, Alan putting a
record out would definitely make me listen to it."</TE>
<TE>   The BellRays, though, are in no hurry to make a deal. They plan to
record a new album this summer, and hope to have it out in
October--whether released on their own or under a new deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the point now where we're going to need to look at how
to facilitate doing business for larger numbers," Kekaula says.
"We're taking it one day at a time. I definitely want people to be
able to get our records. That's always been my goal."</TE>
<TE>   FRESH HORSES: There have been a lot of changes in and around the
Wallflowers between the release of the band's last album, 2000's
"Breach," and the making of its next, due in September.</TE>
<TE>   Guitarist Michael Ward left before sessions started. Longtime
manager Andy Slater (who co-produced the last album with Michael
Penn) became president of Capitol Records. And Tom Whalley left his
job as president of Interscope Records, the band's label, to be
chairman of Warner Bros./Reprise.</TE>
<TE>   The guitarist role hasn't been filled (leader Jakob Dylan did most
of the new album's guitar parts, with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready
adding a few), and the band signed on with new manager Pat Magnorella
(Weezer, Green Day, Goo Goo Dolls).</TE>
<TE>   The production and label changes occasioned a couple of reunions.
To produce, Dylan selected the team of Toby Miller and Bill
Appleberry--Miller was a founding guitarist of the Wallflowers but
left in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "When he left the band, it left a hole in how it functions," Dylan
says. "When we had discussions about producers, there was no one I
was more eager to work with."</TE>
<TE>   At Interscope, Dylan has re-teamed with Mark Williams, the
company's senior executive in charge of A&amp;R, who had been the
Wallflowers' A&amp;R representative for its first album at Virgin
Records.</TE>
<TE>   "I encouraged him to do things differently, come from a new
approach in how he wrote and how they made the record," Williams
says. "Jakob wrote two really great all-out rock songs, and there are
some moodier pieces--one called 'Health and Happiness' has a feel to
me like a Tom Waits song."</TE>
<TE>   Don't, however, tie these changes to "Breach's" disappointing
sales--little more than one-tenth of the 4.1 million sold by its
predecessor, 1996's "Bringing Down the Horse."</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of factors that go into sales," Dylan says.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that affect the making of this record? No, all that is
peripheral and people are far too obsessed with numbers."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Fiona Apple is starting work on her third album, with
Jon Brion back in the production chair. No release date has been
set.... French composer Michel Colombier has been spending a lot of
time with Madonna lately. He scored "Swept Away," the remake of Lina
Wertmuller's '70s film starring the singer and directed by her
husband, Guy Ritchie. He also arranged and conducted strings for her
"Can't You See My Mind," the theme from the upcoming James Bond film,
"Die Another Day." He's done three orchestral arrangements for
Madonna's next album, and he and her record producer, Mirwais, are
talking about collaborating on a new film score....</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Gabriel is following in the footsteps of her father (he's
Peter Gabriel) and has recorded a seven-song EP, with plans for an
independent release. The sessions were produced by New York
singer-songwriter John Washburn (a friend of Gabriel's sister,
filmmaker Anna Gabriel), who describes the music as "artsy-pop" with
engagingly "personal and oblique" lyrics....</TE>
<TE>   Two former members of the Verve--bassist Simon Jones and
guitarist-keyboardist Simon Tong--are anchoring a new band, the
Shining, with a debut album produced by Youth due in the fall. The
group will make its U.S. debut with shows July 8 at New York's Bowery
Ballroom and July 11 at L.A.'s Troubadour.</TE>

<TE>   Cervantes' "Don Quixote of La Mancha" is flavored with circus and
vaudeville, and accompanied by live percussion as Miami's
International Hispanic Theatre Festival makes its Los Angeles debut.
Kicking it off is Brazil's Pia Fraus Teatro in "Farsa

with projected English titles, the production runs Friday through
next Sunday at the Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. Pia Fraus Teatro's
family show, "Bichos do Brasil/Critters of Brazil," a puppet
menagerie of rainforest animals moving to a Brazilian beat, will be
presented at the amphitheater Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   Vox Femina gives two performances this month of a program offering
two world premieres. The first premiere is three new pieces by
composers Joan Szymko, Dave Kopplin and Karen Hart under the single
title "The Tolerance Project." Roger Bourland's "The Alarcon
Madrigals (Book II)" is the other premiere. Performances are today in
Norman L. Pattiz Concert Hall in L.A., and June 22 at the Zipper Hall
in downtown L.A. Iris Levine conducts.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   "H.C. Westermann," a traveling retrospective opening today at
MOCA's Geffen Contemporary in downtown Los Angeles, looks at the late
sculptor's nearly 30-year career through sculptures that combine
assemblage and traditional construction techniques from carpentry and
woodworking. The exhibition, covering the 1950s through 1981,
features about 100 sculptures and 20 works on paper that often
confront the social and political realities of the era.</TE>

<LD>   DJ SHADOW</LD>
<LD>   "The Private Press"</LD>
<TE>   MCA</TE>
<TE>   With his stunning second album, DJ Shadow has created a true
shadow world. On the long-awaited follow-up to his groundbreaking
1996 debut, "Endtroducing," the Bay Area DJ hasn't merely assembled
sounds. He's pieced together bits of lives--or lives' ghosts--that he
found on vinyl recordings, ranging from a melancholy 1951 audio
letter to obscure artifacts from pop's legion of no-hit wonders. In
his hands, these are echoes of peoples' hopes and dreams, woven into
a work as emotionally evocative as it is sonically arresting.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to the sophisticated experiments of found-sound
manipulators the Tape-Beatles or People Like Us than to Moby or
Fatboy Slim, Shadow nonetheless shares the latter pair's dance music
and hip-hop grounding and populist leanings. The only piece with real
song structure is "Six Days," marrying a colorful relationship-as-war
lyric by obscure '70s Liverpool band Colonel Bagshot with oddball
psychedelia from just-as-unknown U.S. '60s artist Dennis Olivieri.</TE>
<TE>   But this is hardly a difficult album. "Fixed Income," with
electro-funk pulse, a harpsichord passage and barely audible spoken
lines, rivals David Holmes' darkly breezy soundtrack work. "Un Autre
Introduction," "Monosylabik" and "Mashin' on the Motorway" offer
audio chop-shop whimsy. "Walkie Talkie" simultaneously honors and
mocks hip-hop swagger. But tying it all together is an underlying
sense of sadness and celebration as Shadow (who headlines L.A.'s
Mayan Theatre on Wednesday) gives new life to these spectral
mementos.</TE>

<TE>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</TE>
<TE>   "Divine Secrets of the</TE>
<TE>   Ya-Ya Sisterhood" soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   DMZ/Columbia</TE>
<TE>   "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack producer T Bone Burnett
proved himself a musical archeologist and synthesist extraordinaire,
and he reaffirms that in "Ya-Ya Sisterhood."</TE>
<TE>   The film covers a span of some 60 years and territory from urban
New York to rural Louisiana. That yields an invigorating and diverse
batch of songs with a wider stylistic range than "O Brother," while
reflecting the same passion for American music sources.</TE>
<TE>   Even though six decades separate the ancient-sounding track by
Cajun musician Blind Uncle Gaspard and a new number Bob Dylan wrote
for this album, "Waitin' for You," they're linked by the traditional
Cajun waltz form as well as the unadulterated emotions they stir.</TE>
<TE>   Tracks bounce across the decades with ease, from World War
II-style big-band swing (Macy Gray's delightful take on "I Want to Be
Your Mother's Son-In-Law") to '70s British folk-rock (Richard and
Linda Thompson's achingly lovely "Dimming of the Day") and '90s
cabaret electronica (Vincent &amp; Mr. Green's ominous "Drug State").</TE>
<TE>   Just as Harry Smith did a half century ago with his revolutionary
"American Folk Music Anthology," Burnett shows up musical boundaries
for the meaningless marketing constructs they are.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   ALBITA</TE>
<TE>   "Hecho a Mano"</TE>
<TE>   Silva Screen/Times Square</TE>
<TE>   This Cuban singer-songwriter was once the glamour girl of Miami's
high-powered Latin music machine, produced by Emilio Estefan for
Sony, tailored by Armani, coiffed and packaged as a South Beach
showcase. Those days ended in 1999 when she and the company parted
ways after her disappointing sales.</TE>
<TE>   Albita's career crash evokes the old Spanish folk saying, No hay
mal que por bien no venga. Indeed, good things can come from bad, and
we have this new album to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   The title captures the state of her art: Made by Hand. This is a
finely crafted work, burnished rather than glossed. The songs, all
written and arranged by Albita, are warm, intimate and soulful.
Without the pressure of courting radio play, they feel organic,
taking unexpected turns and lasting as long as they need to. Some are
stunning, such as "Son Sin Concepto" (Son Without a Concept), with
its arresting, enigmatic monologue, and "La Magia de Ochun," with its
dark doubts and soul-wrenching, reluctant plea to Santeria, the
Afro-Cuban religion.</TE>
<TE>   Albita's tailored five-piece band, plus the singer on guitar,
creates a spare yet sophisticated acoustic sound, evoking her Cuban
country roots. Far from nostalgic, though, this album gives us Albita
reborn, more natural and honest but still sophisticated.</TE>

<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   RAPHAEL SAADIQ</TE>
<TE>   "Instant Vintage"</TE>
<TE>   Universal</TE>
<TE>   Saadiq would rather lay back than throw down. He's got a touch of
Smokey Robinson's liquid satin in his phrasing and a complete absence
of grit. His voice is a supple instrument that commands your
attention because it insidiously draws you close and then envelops
you. That's why despite a wildly successful tenure with Tony Toni
Tone and a somewhat less earth-shattering stint in Lucy Pearl,
Saadiq's voice is more recognizable than his name.</TE>
<TE>   Can Saadiq's politesse make it in a bump-and-grind world? This
album (in stores Tuesday) is really one long, tastefully arranged
quiet storm. The drums tap out gentle rhythms, guitars strum minor
chords, and Saadiq sings imploringly to his lover like a man who
doesn't want to ruffle any feathers.</TE>
<TE>   His lyrics lean toward time-tested love cliches: "You should be
here, babe/Girl, you know you drive me crazy," he sings, but the real
message is to be found in the gentle funk of tracks such as "Still
Ray," with its tinkling, waterfall piano trills and trombone accents,
and "OPH," a casual celebration of kind herb.</TE>
<TE>   "Instant Vintage" is so unassuming that it practically dissolves
upon impact.</TE>
<TE>   Saadiq plays the El Rey Theatre in L.A. on June 17.</TE>
<TE>   --Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Dirty Vegas, "Dirty Vegas," Capitol. Dirty Vegas is the band
featured in that ubiquitous Mitsubishi TV commercial, and while it
would be easy to begrudge the English trio its success, it would also
be unfair, as the band's debut album is much more than "Days Go By."
There are a number of surprises here, notably the '80s-flavored
techno beats on the sonically joyful "Ghosts." Inspired as much by
Pink Floyd and the late-'80s Manchester scene (Happy Mondays) as the
dance world, "Dirty Vegas" is a promising debut.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *** Sierra Maestra, "Rumbero Soy," Riverboat/World Music Network.
Before there was Buena Vista Social Club, there was Sierra Maestra,
the seminal group that gave us Jesus Alemany of Cubanismo and Juan de
Marcos Gonzalez of Afro-Cuban All Stars. After 25 years and 14
albums, the Havana ensemble remains true to its rootsy
formula--tight, traditional percussion, pure and piercing trumpet and
four-part vocal harmonies. This strong new effort (recorded in France
and somewhat marred by muddled sound) features guest vocals by Buena
Vista alumni Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, and unobtrusive rock
embellishments by New York guitarist Marc Ribot and British producer
Chris Birkett. A.G.</TE>

<LD>   MICHEL LEGRAND</LD>
<LD>   "Michel Legrand</LD>
<TE>   by Michel Legrand"</TE>
<TE>   Decca</TE>
<TE>   No one is going to accuse Legrand of being a great jazz pianist,
but his performances of his own film music prove so urgent,
distinctive and emotionally charged as to make them indispensable.
Better yet, he plays solo here, which allows him to radically
reinvent classics such as "The Summer Knows" (from "The Summer of
'42") and "The Windmills of Your Mind" (from "The Thomas Crown
Affair") in personal, idiosyncratic ways.</TE>
<TE>   Although he brings a touch of Duke Ellington to "Watch What
Happens" (from "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"), a hint of Debussy to
"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?" (from "The Happy Ending")
and a bit of Rachmaninoff to "I Will Wait for You" (also from
"Cherbourg"), these influences simply underscore the stylistic range
of his music. Add to this the delicacy of Legrand's keyboard touch,
the subtlety of his harmony and the ingenuity of his voicing, and you
have Legrand tunes reinterpreted as only a composer could.</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   BOB BROOKMEYER</TE>
<TE>   "Waltzing With Zoe"</TE>
<TE>   Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the acknowledged giants of orchestral writing still
toil in the recording studio, and Brookmeyer stands among the best of
them, as every track of this tour de force affirms.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the New Art Orchestra, Brookmeyer presides over a radiant,
rambunctious big band in shrewdly conceived compositions. One marvels
at the momentum and rhythmic drive he brings to the finale of
"Seesaw," the puckishness and harmonic astringency of "Child at
Play," and the sublime colors and ethereal tone he sustains in "For
Maria." Here is the rare large-ensemble jazz recording in which
everything works, from the originality of the compositions and the
high craft of the arrangements to the thorough musicianship and
technical elan of the players.</TE>
<TE>   Brookmeyer packs so much musical information into every cut that
multiple hearings are required to savor the detail of his work.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   HAMIET BLUIETT</TE>
<TE>   "Blueblack"</TE>
<TE>   Justin Time</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has heard Bluiett perform live knows that he reigns as
one of the more magisterial baritone saxophonists in jazz, but his
horn sounds even mightier when he's playing with Baritone Nation, the
reed quartet that raises Cain throughout this thunderous recording.
To hear Bluiett and fellow reedists James Carter, Patience Higgins
and Alex Harding playing at full tilt, as they do during several
passages of a whimsical retooling of "My Girl," is to gain new
respect for the sheer force and color of the baritone sax. Listen to
the way-down-low notes on "Humpback," the ebullient dance rhythms on
"Zippin' " (both penned by the great Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson) and
the bristling counterpoint on "LG's Place," and it's clear that these
four saxophonists hardly need a rhythm section. Nevertheless, they
have a dynamic one in Kahil El'Zabar, who proves virtuosic on African
drums and provocative on improvised vocals. Although the idea of a
baritone band might seem like a novelty, Bluiett and friends persuade
listeners that such an ensemble can sound as natural as any.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   TOM HARRELL</TE>
<TE>   "Live at the Village Vanguard"</TE>
<TE>   RCA Victor</TE>
<TE>   By now, Harrell's gifts as composer, arranger, trumpeter and
improviser are well established, but they're expressed with
particular clarity on this live recording. With the exception of an
occasional intonation problem, Harrell's quintet offers controlled,
often poetic accounts of original tunes that demand no less. If the
exotic scales of "Asia Minor" and the pervasively melancholy spirit
of "Where the Rain" attest to Harrell's skills at writing superior
melodies, "Design" reminds listeners of the ingenuity and
unpredictability of his uptempo music.</TE>
<TE>   As always, Harrell's trumpet lines are works of art in themselves,
and nowhere more than in the standard tune "Everything Happens to
Me," which Harrell dispatches with a gauzy tone and nonchalant
phrasing that are distinctly his.</TE>

<HD>Breaking Out of the Emo Ghetto</HD>
<DH>Faced with health problems and a genre that felt confining,
the Promise Ring chose a radical--and lush--new direction</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indie rock fans tend to believe that artists who don't toil for major
labels are untethered by expectations and free to do just about
anything they please. This may hold true for many artists, but for
the Promise Ring, indie-rock fandom has been more of a crutch than a
boon.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to have a fan base, but it's hard to attract new fans
if people already assume you have an audience," says the Milwaukee
quartet's drummer, Dan Didier, 27. "But it's more important to make
the band happy. If John in Kansas doesn't like the record, it's not
gonna affect me."</LD>
<LD>   This isn't hostile rock star ingratitude, just the pragmatic talk
of a band trying to shed old expectations for new vistas. As one of
the most prominent practitioners of the subgenre called emo, the
Promise Ring has accrued a fan base that has grown comfortable with
guitarist Davey von Bohlen's astringent pop songs. His cryptic lyrics
sketch relationship troubles from the perspective of someone who
would rather sing about his feelings than confront them.</LD>
<TE>   The band's first four albums, beginning with 1996's "30 Degrees
Everywhere," are full to bursting with frisky power-chord energy. But
its latest, "Wood/Water," is either an act of career sabotage or a
giant leap forward--perhaps both. Lush, melancholy, more ambitious
and less callow than the Promise Ring's previous efforts, it sounds
like nothing else in the band's oeuvre. To a man, the Promise Ring
had grown weary of carrying the emo mantle for its fans and of trying
to please its constituency before its own needs were met.</TE>
<TE>   "You lose your perspective; you see you like everyone else sees
you," says Von Bohlen, 27, sitting with his bandmates around the pool
of a Hollywood hotel. "We were the band that goes up there and does
emo, but there is a world of things you can do with a guitar."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the catalyst for the band's rebirth was
something the members--especially Von Bohlen--could have done
without.</TE>
<TE>   "I recorded 'Very Emergency' from pill to pill," says the
guitarist, referring to the band's 1999 album. "I was going through a
bottle of headache pills every two days. That record hurt to record.
Every show supporting it was just awful. Think about having a
headache, then screaming and yelling for an hour."</TE>
<TE>   After suffering from debilitating migraine headaches for more than
a year, it got to the point where Von Bohlen couldn't see clearly or
even walk, and in mid-2000 an MRI revealed a fist-sized brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Didier and guitarist Jason Gnewikow feared for their friend's life
and wondered if it was time to go back to their day jobs. "I thought,
'Well, we had our run, but it's over now,' " Didier says. "I didn't
expect Davey to come back to the band. Not that I didn't have faith
in him, but I thought that would be enough for him."</TE>
<TE>   Von Bohlen underwent three operations in two years to remove the
benign mass. In April he endured the final operation: A plastic
prosthetic plate was inserted into his skull to replace an infected
fragment the surgeons had removed. Although Von Bohlen is now
headache-free and feels great, a deep declension near the front of
his skull serves as a permanent war scar.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it changed all of us," says Von Bohlen, who met Gnewikow
and Didier when they were all playing in different high school punk
bands. (Original bassist Scott Schoenbeck was replaced by Ryan Weber
last year.)</TE>
<TE>   "But it didn't change me any more than it changed these guys. What
happens is, your spectrum of what you care about becomes much
smaller. Like, I don't care if Spin gave this record a bad review.
That might have bothered us before, when we thought career was
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Gnewikow and Didier felt emboldened by Von Bohlen's recovery. If
their leader could survive a brain tumor, anything was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to shake things up, the Promise Ring left its label,
Delaware-based Jade Tree, and signed with Anti, a division of L.A.'s
Epitaph Records.</TE>
<TE>   The move to one of the top U.S. independent labels figures to
raise its commercial prospects. (No Promise Ring album has ever sold
more than 45,000 units.) But just as important was the first decent
recording budget in the band's career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to record an album in two days," Von Bohlen says. "We
never had time in the past to put any extra stuff on our albums. If
two people disagreed about something, that argument would have to end
in five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Didier, "The performances would have been better, because
it's hard to record when you know every take has to be perfect."</TE>
<TE>   The Promise Ring decamped to Farnham, a rural hamlet outside
London, to live and record in a country house with Stephen Street, a
producer whose credits include albums with the Smiths and Blur.
Street helped the band explore new approaches to arranging tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a percussion loop that served as a click track for us to
play to in the song 'What About April,' " Von Bohlen says, "and
Stephen just thought it would be better to leave it in the final
track. It changed the whole vibe of the song."</TE>
<TE>   Freed from the constraints of being a leading figure in the emo
movement, Von Bohlen as a songwriter relied less on the elliptical
feints he had used in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more direct in terms of putting what I really think on
paper," he says. "I feel like the lyrics are married to the music
better than they have been. I'm getting better at putting them in the
right place."</TE>
<TE>   The negative review that ran in Spin notwithstanding, "Wood/Water"
seems not to have had the divisive effect on their audience that the
band feared. The musicians also feel good about the fact that
Wilco--a band they revere--has, like the Promise Ring, upended
expectations with its boldly murky new release, "Yankee Hotel

<DH>With a string of casualties offsetting its box office
triumphs, MGM gambles mightily on 'Windtalkers'</DH>

<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a moving tribute last July, President Bush stood in the Capitol
Rotunda, where he presented the nation's highest civilian honor--the
Congressional Gold Medal--to four surviving members of the original
29 Navajo "code talkers," whose daring exploits with the Marine Corps
in World War II helped defeat Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Among the invited guests that day were director John Woo, actor
Nicolas Cage and other cast members of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's
$100-million-plus wartime action film "Windtalkers," which tells the
story of how the Marines used the Navajo recruits' complex, unwritten
language as a secret code against the Japanese military in the
Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   MGM had been counting on news coverage of the solemn ceremony to
create public awareness of this little-known piece of history as the
studio prepared to launch an advertising blitz for the film, which
was scheduled to open in November over the Veterans Day holiday. Then
terrorists struck on Sept. 11, and MGM pulled "Windtalkers" from its
fall schedule and gave it a new release date of June 14--Flag Day.</LD>
<TE>   The question that has haunted MGM ever since was, did it make the
right decision?</TE>
<TE>   Rated R for "pervasive graphic war violence," Woo's film is an
edgy psychological drama packed with epic combat scenes. It seems a
proper fit for the more serious fall season. But releasing the movie
in summer, when theaters are still crowded with youth-oriented
popcorn movies is a strategy fraught with danger. Especially
bothersome for MGM is that other studios decided not to delay the
release of their war movies because of Sept. 11--a strategy that
seemed to have no ill effect.</TE>
<TE>   For MGM, the smallest of Hollywood's seven major studios,
"Windtalkers" represents an enormous gamble. Woo and Cage certainly
have the track record; they teamed up with John Travolta in 1997 in
the action-drama "Face/Off," which grossed $112 million. But MGM is a
studio that is attempting to regain its footing after three
embarrassing box office misfires, which included two high-profile
Bruce Willis films, "Bandits" and "Hart's War," and the
effects-driven remake "Rollerball"--this for a studio that only
releases between 10 and 15 films a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Hart's War," the flameout was so embarrassing that
even the filmmakers questioned MGM's marketing of the film, claiming
the studio tried to get the public to believe the intense courtroom
drama with racial overtones was a Bruce Willis action film. Indeed,
an in-house MGM document obtained by The Times shows that selling it
as an action film was part of the studio's pre-release marketing and
distribution plan for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Tiffany of Hollywood studios, MGM today operates out of
an office building in Santa Monica, where bigger-than-life images
taken from some of the studio's famous films grace the subterranean
walls of the parking garage. Despite its small size, MGM is still a
major brand name in the world of entertainment, the roar of its lion
on the opening credits familiar to moviegoers everywhere. With a
library of 4,100 films, the company's storied history includes such
Academy Award winning movies as the 1935 "Mutiny on the Bounty," "An
American in Paris," "Gigi" and "Ben-Hur."</TE>
<TE>   For MGM employees, the past 18 months have been unsettling. One
week, they're rejoicing over "Hannibal," which opened in the spring
2001 with $58 million at the box office, the biggest debut ever for
an R-rated film, and another week they're ducking under desks hoping
they don't get blamed for a stinker like "Original Sin."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 2001, MGM's slate of films for the year had grossed
$448.5 million in total domestic box office, a vast improvement from
the measly $95.3 million the studio chalked up the previous year. But
the sobering reality was that two films had accounted for more than
half the 2001 total. "Hannibal," co-produced with Universal Pictures,
was responsible for $165.1 million, and the breezy Reese Witherspoon
comedy "Legally Blonde" surprised everyone by grossing $96.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   After last summer's Martin Lawrence comedy "What's the Worst That
Could Happen?" sputtered to a dismal $32.3 million, MGM's top brass
quickly ousted the heads of marketing and distribution, both industry
veterans who had a hand in the success of "Hannibal" and "Legally
Blonde." In their place, the studio installed Robert Levin as
president of worldwide theatrical marketing and distribution. Levin
is a veteran marketing executive who served previously at Sony
Pictures Entertainment and Disney. By year's end, there was a shakeup
in the publicity department as MGM brought in Jamie Geller-Hartoff to
head that post.</TE>
<TE>   The studio argued that this new marketing and publicity team would
be better equipped to handle a ramped-up slate of films in the
pipeline. But even with a new team, MGM's moves have been
second-guessed in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   It began after Sept. 11. As news bulletins flashed across
television screens chronicling America's new war on terror, MGM Vice
Chairman Christopher McGurk and Levin weighed the risks to their
company if "Windtalkers" were to be released in early November.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a massive television schedule planned," Levin recalled.
"Sept. 28th was the date we would have had to book solid all that
television. That was close to an $18-million decision. That was two
weeks after Sept. 11. If you recall, Washington was not sure what
would happen next."</TE>
<TE>   What if there was another terrorist attack the week before the
movie came out and all the networks replaced highly rated
entertainment shows like "ER" and "Friends" with 24-hour,
commercial-free news coverage?</TE>
<TE>   "What do we do?" Levin said in a recent interview. "If we pull the
movie, we essentially lose $18 million. If we leave the movie, do we
have enough power [via available TV spots] to open the movie
properly?"</TE>
<TE>   MGM blinked.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, MGM probably should have taken the gamble and
released the movie last fall. The terrorists did not strike U.S. soil
in the months that followed. The country slowly got back on its feet.
By early November, life was returning to a semblance of normalcy and
people once again were flocking to the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind Enemy Lines," a 20th Century Fox movie about a U.S. pilot
shot down in the Balkans, became a modest hit, and Columbia's "Black
Hawk Down," a retelling of the tragedy-marred U.S. involvement in
Somalia, was a critical and box office winner.</TE>
<TE>   By February, however, the public's appetite for war movies began
to wane. Proof of that was "Hart's War," which debuted in seventh
place. Weeks later, the Mel Gibson Vietnam War drama, "We Were
Soldiers," fell far short of Gibson's usual box office potential. The
film has grossed less than $80 million domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these omens and the restrictive R rating, Levin argues
that "Windtalkers" could become a breakout hit because (a) it isn't
like anything else out there this summer, and (b) Woo's built-in
action fan base won't be disappointed by the gripping battle
sequences the director stages.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether being the last war movie out of the starting gate
could hurt "Windtalkers," he replied: "I think that this film, while
being a movie centering on war, has its own unique relationships.
It's not just a war film. I think if we were coming out in May
instead of June, it would be a greater concern, but I think the more
time that passes, it doesn't feel like 'Black Hawk Down' or 'We Were
Soldiers.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Cage plays Joe Enders, a Marine whose unit is cut to
pieces because of his indecision about whether to fall back. Later,
haunted by that fateful day, Enders is assigned to guard a Navajo
(Adam Beach); unknown to the code talker, Enders has also been given
orders to kill him should he be in danger of capture.</TE>
<TE>   Woo fills the screen with intense combat, utilizing 700 extras and
more than a dozen cameras at times to document a single battle. Much
of it is standard Hollywood shoot-'em-up stuff. But there is also a
serious underpinning to the movie--the racism met by the code talkers
who shipped out overseas to fight for America. Although MGM
executives will only confirm that the film's production budget came
in at more than $100 million, insiders peg the budget at $118
million. Studio President Michael Nathanson notes that MGM's
investment is really closer to $80 million because it has sold off
some of the foreign rights.</TE>
<TE>   One thing MGM will need to do to make "Windtalkers" a breakout
hit, is build momentum that was lost last year.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the studio brought Woo, Cage and other cast members,
as well as eight former code talkers, to Washington, D.C., for the
movie's premiere on Tuesday at the Uptown Theater. The invited guests
included high-level politicians and members of the executive branch.
A day earlier, studio executives had joined Woo and the code talkers
for a session with Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, after arriving on the south lawn of the White House in
the presidential helicopter, Bush greeted Woo, Cage and other cast
members, along with MGM executives. Bush even invited Cage to step
behind the ropes and join him in posing for press photographs.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Colin Powell met with MGM
executives and the "Windtalkers" cast (minus Cage) at the State
Department.</TE>
<TE>   While many in Hollywood root for MGM to return to some semblance
of its past glory, recent events do not augur well for the studio.</TE>
<TE>   In October, MGM had high hopes for Barry Levinson's bank-heist
black comedy "Bandits." With a proven director, a top-notch cast in
Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett, and a quirky plot, the
movie wasn't an easy sell, but it had star power and received
generally positive reviews. The movie opened to a respectable $13
million its first weekend in release, but quickly flattened out and
grossed only $41.5 million in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Then in early February, MGM rolled out John McTiernan's
high-octane "Rollerball," but after poor advance word and reviews,
the film tanked.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, "Hart's War," in which Willis co-starred with the
hot young actor Colin Farrell, opened with a dismal $7.8 million.
Most studios would drool to have one Bruce Willis movie, let alone
two. But somehow MGM managed to bungle both.</TE>
<TE>   Because of "Bandits," MGM was determined not to see "Hart's War"
fail, especially because Willis was being paid $21 million for only
six weeks of work. (According to a source close to the studio, Willis
was paid more than $40 million for his two MGM films.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the filmmakers' protests, however, Levin chose to sell
"Hart's War" strictly as a Willis action film, ignoring the fact that
it was an intense courtroom drama set in a wartime POW camp. That had
the effect of turning off Willis' core fans, who expect a big
shoot-'em-up, and it also meant that those who might have enjoyed a
courtroom drama stayed away.</TE>
<TE>   Producers David Ladd and David Foster agreed that the movie they
made was a courtroom drama. "They sold a picture that wasn't there,"
Foster said. "It was a misleading, deceptive campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Ladd, who has been at MGM for 13 years, added: "I certainly
thought there were good commercial visual elements, but the movie was
a courtroom drama-thriller."</TE>
<TE>   In an internal MGM marketing and distribution plan for the film
dated Jan. 8, the studio ticked off the key elements in the movie,
from Willis as the star and its patriotic theme, to expected good
reviews and a suspenseful, unexpected plot twist.</TE>
<TE>   But the document also noted the "cheatable action" in the film.
Under the heading "Challenges," the document states: "Enough moments
to create an action sell to open the picture, but in reality a
'cheat.' "</TE>
<TE>   Levin said it is "disingenuous" on the part of the filmmakers to
criticize the marketing because they were all in on the discussions.
"There may have been disagreements, but it was not done without their
knowledge." The filmmakers say they strenuously fought the decision
but were overruled by Levin.</TE>
<TE>   MGM has high hopes for the 20th James Bond film, "Die Another
Day," which stars Pierce Brosnan and Oscar winner Halle Berry, and
opens Nov. 22. But Bond is not a new franchise, and, unlike years
past, "Die Another Day" will face stiff competition, sandwiched
between two powerhouse sequels--to "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of
the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   The studio recently struck a deal with Berry for her to star in
and produce two movies--a remake of the 1974 "Foxy Brown" and the
character study "Brown-Eyed Girl."</TE>
<TE>   And, even though the marriage has not yet struck pay dirt, MGM has
signed a first-look deal with Willis' production company, Cheyenne
Enterprises, to develop movie and TV projects through comic book king
Stan Lee's company, Pow! Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   As for recent mistakes made by MGM, Levin says that it's time to
move on: "For me to be put in a defensive position on movies that
didn't work, I'll just say, 'It didn't work.' "</TE>

<DL>CHARTRES, France</DL>
<LD>I was hooked on this small hilltop town when I heard about the river
jousting.</LD>
<LD>   Gazing down from the center of town, I was tracing the curves of a
long-demolished Roman amphitheater. Then my digital companion, a CD
audio tour guide I had picked up from the local tourist office,
informed me that Roman Empire-era residents of the town packed the
amphitheater not only for speeches and plays but also to watch
floating jousting matches on the Eure River below.</LD>
<LD>   I turned off the CD player and pondered this quirky historical
tidbit: Two thousand years ago, Romans were waging mock battles on
boats on this small, meandering river. This, I realized, was a town
worth getting to know.</LD>
<TE>   Only 53 miles southwest of Paris, Chartres is typically a day trip
for visitors to the French capital. But a better idea is to spend a
night or two away from the crowds that throng Paris and savor the
calmer atmosphere of Chartres.</TE>
<TE>   It is a small town--its economy is largely based on tourism
centered on its renowned cathedral, along with agriculture--but its
rich history, charming, walkable streets, interesting medieval
churches, museums and galleries focusing on French art, history and
stained glass provide ample diversion for an overnight traveler.</TE>
<TE>   As in most European cities, the layers of history in Chartres sit
unceremoniously on top of one another: A Roman amphitheater gives way
to narrow medieval streets; Gothic churches sit beside 20th century
houses. It's a town of so much history that officials dug up a Roman
building site in front of the cathedral a few years ago and, after
detailing its contents, covered it up again with dirt.</TE>
<TE>   But the town's history wasn't the main thing on my mind as I left
Paris in early March to spend three days here. I had become
interested in labyrinths and decided to make a pilgrimage to see the
cathedral and the labyrinth that graces its nave. My wife, who's not
much of a labyrinth walker, agreed to stay at home in Baltimore with
the kids.</TE>
<TE>   I sat on the left side of the train and watched Parisian suburbs
dissolve into forests and farmland. Finally, Chartres'
cathedral--with its green copper roof and two utterly dissimilar
towers--rose majestically in the distance above the Beauce
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   When I arrived in late afternoon, the town of 42,000 residents
bustled with energy, students heading home from school, workers
leaving offices. And everybody, it seemed, clutched a freshly baked
baguette.</TE>
<TE>   I made the easy walk from the station to Chartres' small, modern
commercial district to drop my bag at the Hotel de la Poste. In
minutes I was headed to the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Chartres' spiritual heritage runs deep. Druids once worshiped
here, and by the 8th century the town had built a Catholic cathedral,
although it was destroyed by the Duke of Aquitaine after a dispute
among nobles.</TE>
<TE>   Another cathedral was burned by Viking intruders, and a splendid
medieval church on the site was destroyed by fire in 1194. The
townsfolk moved quickly, rebuilding the existing cathedral in only 25
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Cathedral of Our Lady is considered by many to be the
unsurpassed jewel of Gothic architecture. I entered through the Royal
Portal--its extravagant west entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the entranceway's sculptures, which depict a range of
biblical figures, have been replaced with models; others are pocked
and eroded. A statue of Jesus over the center door has lost a chunk
of its left arm.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everywhere, dirt and soot obscure the beauty of its
exterior, giving it a somber appearance. Thankfully, recent
restoration work on the north facade has revealed the much more
welcoming, cream-colored limestone the cathedral's builders used.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Adams, an American writer, wrote in his 1904 treatise on
Chartres: "The cathedral has moods, at times severe." Indeed, at
first glance, the interior is severe--jaw-droppingly huge, dark and
cool. Voices echo off the stone surfaces, and there's a faint smell
of burning candles.</TE>
<TE>   The interior was built on a superhuman scale. An oversized 18th
century high altar in the style of Bernini dominates the view down
the nave. The vaulted ceiling rises more than 10 stories. Massive
columns stand like sentries up and down the church.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Adams noted, "Chartres is all windows"--roughly
three-quarters of an acre of stained glass in hundreds of panels
spilling gentle, colorful light into the harsh space below. The
windows include tributes to obscure saints and more familiar biblical
references, including a violent depiction of the Good Samaritan story
and a retelling of Noah's Ark, complete with a beautiful
rainbow-colored sea and a pair of tusked elephants. Bring a pair of
binoculars, for you could spend hours tracing the windows' stories.</TE>
<TE>   I was delighted to find windows depicting the 12 signs of the
zodiac and aspects of life in the 13th century--a barebacked man
threshing wheat, winemakers stomping grapes, a farmer preparing to
slaughter a pig with an ax. For a congregation that couldn't read,
these surely would have illuminated the services in the awe-inspiring
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow the windows survived the fires and wars that rocked
Europe. Chartres officials protected them during the last century's
world wars by removing the stained glass for safekeeping elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Another survivor is tucked inside a gold case in a small chapel: a
tattered remnant of the cathedral's relic, a piece of white cloth
said to have been worn by the Virgin Mary when she gave birth to
Jesus. The relic was considered to be a symbol of divine protection
for the town and, so the story goes, miraculously survived the 1194
fire.</TE>
<TE>   After exploring the cathedral, I was ready to walk the labyrinth.
Chartres' reputation as a destination for spiritual pilgrims has been
revived in recent years, thanks to the labyrinth that was inlaid into
its stone nave around 1200.</TE>
<TE>   Labyrinths are circuitous paths that lead the walker into a center
space and out again. Hundreds of years ago, pilgrims traveled the
stones of Chartres' labyrinth--often on their knees--as a substitute
for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   Today, interest in the labyrinth as a meditation tool has surged,
and Chartres has the best known of the surviving ancient paths. But
the people of Chartres seem to care little about theirs. Except on
most Fridays, the labyrinth is covered up with folding chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Although I had seen many pictures of the labyrinth, I hadn't
expected its sheer aged look. Made of two colors of stone--a lighter
one for the path and a darker, blue-black marble for the borders--the
labyrinth is cracked and rutted, a twisting moonscape.</TE>
<TE>   I moved through the path alone and pondered the countless walkers
who had gone before me--monks, nobles, soldiers, nuns--feeling a
sense of communion with pilgrims across eight centuries.</TE>
<TE>   That evening I took a long walk through the labyrinthine streets
of the old town before settling in for dinner at the Brasserie
Chatelet. I enjoyed its specialty: a large bowl full of mussels and
fries, accompanied by draft Belgian beer. A steaming, velvety tarte
Tatin concluded a perfectly fine--and inexpensive--meal.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Saturday, I went to the huge open-air food
market in the Place Billard. It seemed every resident of Chartres was
there, each toting a basket or pulling a shopping cart.</TE>
<TE>   I was sorry that I had eaten breakfast at the hotel when I saw the
array of fruits and vegetables, as well as crepes, oysters on the
half shell, breads, cheeses and pates. Nearby, on the Rue des
Changes, where centuries ago bankers aided pilgrims by exchanging
currencies, farmers were selling live animals--ducks, geese and
chickens.</TE>
<TE>   Next I spent several pleasant hours retracing Chartres' history,
using the well-produced CD audio guide. It led me on a rigorous trek
down the hill from the cathedral, through winding alleys to the banks
of the Eure, where mills and tanneries once flourished, and back up
again.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 years ago, Chartres was a settlement of the
Carnutes--ancient Gauls for whom the town is named. It later fell to
the Romans, who called it Autricum. As I followed the walking tour, I
saw little visible evidence of Roman occupation. But along the way I
glimpsed the long-gone medieval wall that surrounded the cathedral to
create a religious city within the city. There was also a trace of
the Porte Guillaume, the massive medieval city gate, which was blown
up by the German army as it retreated during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The CD guide led me to three other churches in town. St. Andrew's,
which dates back to the 1100s, sits cozily by the Eure. In the 13th
century, when the church needed to expand, it simply built an
addition over the river. Although the addition is long gone, you can
still see portions of supporting arches of this piece of audacious
civil engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly higher up the hill rests the Church of St. Peter, a dank
Gothic stone masterpiece, which features 29 impressive stained-glass
windows from the 13th and 14th centuries, and St. Aignan Church, an
airy, barrel-vaulted structure with an interior of brightly painted
wood. Both need significant restoration, and my head spun as I
contemplated the financial burden these historic structures--and the
cathedral--place on this small town.</TE>
<TE>   One stop that left me dissatisfied was at the Rue aux Juifs, the
center of the town's onetime Jewish ghetto. Chartres was no kinder to
Jews than the rest of medieval Europe, expelling them entirely in
1394 after years of persecution. But the matter-of-fact audiotape
gave no glimpse of the life they led here.</TE>
<TE>   Chartres abounds in information, though, about vitrail, stained
glass. The International Stained Glass Center occupies the main floor
of a former medieval storehouse a block from the cathedral. The
barn-like building displays delicate ink drawings of newly designed
French churches and their stained-glass windows, as well as an
interesting collection of traditional and abstract windows.</TE>
<TE>   A short walk away, La Galerie du Vitrail had an impressive
collection of original stained glass and reproductions of some panels
in the cathedral, with many of the pieces priced at less than $200.</TE>
<TE>   During my walk I grabbed lunch on the go--a soggy tuna sandwich,
washed down with an Orangina, followed by cappuccino and an eclair.
There were, of course, countless patisseries and coffee shops for
snacks along the way.</TE>
<TE>   I ended my solo tour in midafternoon at the Musee des Beaux-Arts,
a fine arts museum housed in the former home of Chartres' bishops.
The museum is creaky and dusty, but there were treasures worth
perusing. Many of the names of the painters--Francisco de Zurbaran,
Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin, Maurice de Vlaminck and Chaim Soutine,
among others--were barely familiar, but their work was impressive.
There was also a nice collection of intricate enamels, old
harpsichords and a startling depiction of one of the many fires that
roared through Chartres, this one in 1836. But my favorite was a 17th
century oil of "un jeune garcon," a young boy holding--what else?--a
gnawed-on baguette.</TE>
<TE>   For my last night in town I splurged at the slightly upscale Le
Pichet, on a quiet street a block from the cathedral. The kitchen
produced a marvelous cassoulette, a seafood stew with potatoes and
carrots in a garlic-laced broth. Onion soup came with butter-drenched
croutons.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I took a last look at the cathedral, grabbed
another tuna sandwich for the road and walked down the hill to catch
my train for Paris. I had crossed the Atlantic to see the
labyrinth--and it had lived up to its billing. But I had not been
prepared for the subtle pleasures of Chartres itself. What better
reward for a traveler than unexpected delights?</TE>

<DL>SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA, Chile</DL>
<LD>I worship deserts. In my native New Zealand, a rain-free day is a
small miracle, so my sodden soul soars when I feel that dry heat and
behold those azure skies.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine my bliss in Chile's Atacama Desert, a behemoth that
stretches for about 2,000 miles and where, in some places, there has
never been a drop of recorded rainfall.</LD>
<LD>   By April of this year, I had spring fever and was ready for a
break, preferably someplace exotic. So two friends and I signed up
for some world-class pampering in Chile, which had enticed me for
years. By night we would stay at a top-notch lodge, eat superb food
and drink fine wine, but during the day we would engage every muscle
in vigorous athletic pursuits.</LD>
<TE>   Stephanie Tuck, a recently escaped music editor for a tragically
hip New York magazine, and Wickham Boyle, an author whose book on
9/11 raised money for Ground Zero schools, and I flew into Santiago,
stayed one night, then headed northward to Calama, an inland mining
town and hub for central Atacama travel. The hotel van met us at the
tiny, busy airport, and we set out for San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the Atacama looked lifeless, flat and gray. It
reminded me of the moon, which I always thought desolate after the
thrill of man's landing on it subsided. After 40 minutes of this
monotony, the van crested a hill, and suddenly we were in the
surrealist drama of the Chilean badlands.</TE>
<TE>   Boulders bathed in red light, twisted escarpments and silky dunes
exploded below. To the right, a gorge was populated with grotesque
shapes, whittled by winds over eons of time. To the left were fields
of cracked mud and fingers of ocher sand reaching across to the
snowcapped Andes. And smack in the middle was a pod of greenery
encircling adobe houses: San Pedro de Atacama, an oasis of 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro is perched at 8,000 feet in the central part of the
Atacama Desert of northern Chile, about 50 miles from the Bolivian
border. It gets minimal rain--a whole inch a year--but is endowed
with springs, geothermal waters and rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the altitude, the weather is moderate. Daytime
temperatures range from 69 to 76 degrees year-round; the warmest
months are November through March, summer in South America. Nighttime
temperatures can drop as low as 30 degrees in the winter months of
August through October. The inch of rain comes mainly in January.</TE>
<TE>   We were staying at the Explora, a place I had heard about from
other adventurous friends. Although it was more expensive than the
smaller, less glamorous hotels in San Pedro, we rationalized that
when you factor in all the meals, drinks, transfers, equipment and
guides, the tab for a four-day stay--$1,296 per person--was
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   The Explora company is known for its singular lodges. Nine years
ago it built the 30-room Explora Patagonia in Chile's Torres del
Paine National Park, a contemporary, upscale hotel that attracts
active luxury travelers to the bottom of the world. In 1998 it opened
the 50-room Explora Atacama, a haven of understated elegance from
which to undertake explorations.</TE>
<TE>   The Explora philosophy is environmental immersion through active
journeying. The management likes to provide you with a serene but
knowing guide, some gorp and water, and a method of self-transport
and wave you on your way. And when you finish your excursion in some
gorgeous location, staffers are there waiting for you with chilled
beverages, antipasto platters, dry towels and an air-conditioned van
to ferry you back to the hotel for your swim, your massage and your
epicurean meals.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at midday, we were ushered into the bar to meet with
Paula Valdes, Explora's charming head guide.</TE>
<TE>   "There are five choices this afternoon," she said. "You can
horseback ride, take one of two hikes, go on a photographic safari or
mountain bike. If you want to climb the volcano, I suggest you do it
near the end of your stay and work up to the altitude."</TE>
<TE>   El Toco volcano, a one-morning ascent to 18,372 icy,
oxygen-starved feet, is a source of fun for stalwart sorts, some of
whom don't make it and have to be shouldered down to an oxygen tank
in the van.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, that won't be me," said Wicki, ever the pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do it," said Steph, ever the overachiever.</TE>
<TE>   For that day, however, we chose acclimatization with a mild
three-hour hike through the Kari Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   To get there, we were required to bound down a steep sand dune
like adolescents in a Mountain Dew commercial. Below was a cracked,
flesh-toned plain covered with dazzling white salt crystals. The
Atacama used to be under the ocean, and sodium chloride remains in
the earth. When it rains or when the night air produces moisture, it
rises to the surface, staying put like a permanent dusting of snow.</TE>
<TE>   We climbed through the rocky corridors, grottoes and narrow,
salt-crusted fissures as the sun sank and the rocks glowed a feverish
red.</TE>
<TE>   We intended to be at the Valle de la Luna, or Valley of the Moon,
for sunset, a short drive by van from Kari Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   As we struggled up to a knife-edge ridge overlooking Valle de la
Luna, the nearly full moon hung fat in the darkening sky on one side
while the sun seeped behind a ridge on the other. The climb was only
300 yards, but the 9,000-foot altitude made it slow going.</TE>
<TE>   It was worth every labored breath when we reached the top. The
creased umber canyons lay below us, the lights of San Pedro glimmered
in the distance and the Andes grinned gap-toothed from the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   I rose early to bike the mile from Explora into San Pedro. On the
outskirts of town I passed houses molded of adobe with thatched roofs
and rows of corn in the garden. The Atacamanos sat in small doorways
or leaned on gates crafted from crooked sticks. Gauchos on ponies
stamped terracotta clouds from the dusty roads, and bowlegged
grandmothers in flat-topped hats and woven shawls lumbered by laden
with baskets of food.</TE>
<TE>   In the tiny town center, established about 450 years ago by the
conquering Spaniards, narrow alleys twist past bars and shops. The
Iglesia San Pedro, a quaint, whitewashed 18th century church, stands
on a colonial plaza opposite the entrance to the artisanal market, a
row of dim stalls selling the local crafts--saddle blankets, cactus
wood statuettes and alpaca sweaters. Despite its size, the town is
clearly set up for foreign and Chilean tourism. Hip restaurants
serving international and local cuisine line the streets, as do small
hotels and adventure outfitters.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped at the Museo Gustavo le Paige, El Dorado for
pre-Columbian buffs. Le Paige, a Belgian priest with a penchant for
archeology, helped the local people stake a claim to their artifacts
and organize this museum, reputed to be one of South America's best.
The San Pedro area was part of the pre-Hispanic Tiwanaku, Atacaman
and Incan civilizations, and the arid air has preserved the museum's
mummies, tools, textiles and pottery with spooky intactness. One
diminutive mummy, the doorman told me, is nicknamed Miss Chile:
"She's thin, she's got great hair, and people love taking her
picture."</TE>
<TE>   When I returned to the hotel, a fine-looking man on a fine-looking
horse was riding out of the bar and through the lobby. He rose in the
saddle, tipped his hat, said "Buenos dias" and rode off into the
lounge.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred to me then that the hotel had been designed around
horses. The Explora Atacama has won awards for its design, and I knew
that Pedro Ibanez, the wealthy industrialist owner, is an avid
horseman. I now understood why there are ramps and immense sliding
stable-like doors everywhere. Even the guest rooms skirted a
courtyard, like the grand estancia stables of old, and the wall
decorations were the tasteful, hand-loomed saddle blankets of the
local cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   Horses and the irregular angles of the Andes were the
architectural inspiration. The hotel's fireplaces tilt in diagonal,
and the roof lines are irregular and imperfect, like the seamless
eccentricities found in nature. There are skylights in unexpected
places, hidden rooftop patios with serene views and meandering
pathways of quietude.</TE>
<TE>   The horseman was Miguel Yarur, Chile's former national equestrian
champion, demigod of the stables, horse whisperer extraordinaire. It
turned out he was riding through the lobby to indulge a photographer,
but, I was assured, the hotel was indeed designed for such whimsy.</TE>
<TE>   I had forfeited a trip to El Tatio geysers that morning because I
couldn't tolerate the four-hour round-trip drive. I later regretted
it. A group left at 4:30 a.m. to reach the geysers by sunrise, when
the fumaroles jet to life. When Wicki returned, she raved about the
hazy extraterrestrial feel of the place and about a close encounter
with a fox and several vicunas.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Steph and I hiked four miles into the Guatin Puritama
valley. We climbed past pre-Incan ruins, over small waterfalls and
beneath the plumes of pampas grass and hoary cactuses, ending with a
swim in Puritama Hot Springs. A chain of pools spilled subterranean
mineral water down the mountainside, waters that have been used as
elixirs for centuries. The Incas apparently used the Puritama as a
place of peace to settle disputes and lower stress--the original day
spa.</TE>
<TE>   We returned to the hotel for lunch and siesta. Explora's French
chef serves exquisite meals, balanced to be light on the stomach but
high in protein for maximum energy. My favorite was pataska, a
locally derived dish of corn and potato. On the highbrow end, the
duck confit was heavenly.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon we went riding, something I have done sporadically
since I was a girl. These days I seek destinations where you can
escape the liability-limited, plodding trail rides of the United
States. The Atacama has a reputation for genuine horsemanship.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel, who was leading the ride, strode out of the stables to
meet us. He was compact and strong, with the kind of masculinity that
seemed to discombobulate women of all ages. The effect was compounded
when he dropped to his knees to strap on my half-chaps. Pure Latin
chivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "Hola, Amanda," he said as he knelt at my feet. "You ride, no?" It
sounded more like a command than a question.</TE>
<TE>   I equivocated. I ride adequately, but in the presence of a man
like Miguel, it would not do to overstate one's ability. Further,
Miguel trained the horses, and you could practically see them
genuflect when he walked by.</TE>
<TE>   He flicked his head, and a groom appeared with Mascota, a lanky,
highly bred Chilean-English mix. Mascota handled with almost
clairvoyant grace, possibly the best-mannered horse I have ridden.
Our merry band was enamored of our mounts; we were enamored of the
sunshine and the clear air and the empty plains before us; and we
were all a little enamored of Miguel.</TE>
<TE>   We rode for several miles into Valle de la Muerte, Death Valley,
another expanse etched with shadows and clefts. We passed quite a
sporting tableau: sand boarders, mountain bikers and hikers. We rode
hard, Miguel's war horse Caesar leading the charge, galloping up sand
dunes, splashing through streams and racing across the desert. It was
challenging and intoxicating.</TE>
<TE>   The riders gathered to drink heartily in the bar that evening.
Pisco sours are the Chilean drink of choice, and Miguel poured a mean
one. I had read that pisco, a 90-proof brandy distilled from wine
grapes, "loosens tongues while sharpening wits."</TE>
<TE>   "Please," I thought, "let the latter be true."</TE>
<TE>   Javier, a gentle, ponytailed guide, was assigned to take the women
mountain biking to Sejas Lagoon the next morning. (Steph, having to
make hard choices, had given up on the volcano climb, preferring to
go biking.) We packed our bathing suits and bathroom slippers,
straddled the latest-model mountain bikes and headed across the
landscape plains.</TE>
<TE>   We cycled 16 miles past tussocked plains, pedaling furiously
through deep tracts of sand and over crusty salt flats. And just as
the landscape became utterly barren, we arrived at an aquamarine
thermal lake, ringed in toadstool configurations of razor-sharp salt
crystals--hence the slippers. The salt can cut skin to shreds. We
dove in, slippers on, scaring off a flock of flamingos, which wheeled
above us in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   We bobbed about in the weirdly buoyant saline water, warmed by hot
vents from below, soaking out the pisco.</TE>
<TE>   It was our final day, and the mountain biking was merely the first
in a crescendo of activities.</TE>
<TE>   The previous night, Miguel had leaned over the bar with a smile
and said, "You want a muy peligroso ride tomorrow, Amanda?"</TE>
<TE>   "Why, yes," I, or probably the pisco sours, had replied, cavalier
at the word "dangerous." "Muy peligroso. No problema."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be--how you do say--saltar."</TE>
<TE>   "Jumping," I said. "Right."</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't jumped in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   After our morning excursion to Sejas Lagoon, a small group of us
set off in midafternoon to Quebrada de Diablo, Devil's Canyon. We ran
the horses across the desert and loped them through narrow box
canyons. They jumped up rocky ledges and over small rifts. They
climbed stolidly upward over moraine and along precarious cliff-side
tracks. These were magnificent beasts, so well trained it was
mind-boggling. The ride was dangerous indeed, and if just one of
those horses had spooked there could well have been an ugly ending.</TE>
<TE>   We climbed until we had a view like no other, a 360-degree
panorama of ravines and volcanoes, lakes and salty wastelands, and
green, green oases.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbling off the horses at sunset, we gingerly mounted bikes and
rode into San Pedro for a drink at Adobe, our favorite town bar, with
a roaring fire under a palapa. At night the town comes alive. Chilean
bohemians take to the streets; backpackers gather to swap
dollar-a-day fables; ponytailed astrologers gaze into telescopes;
locals sell silver jewelry; and hippies of every nation waft about in
parachute pants and muslin head scarves.</TE>
<TE>   The moon was full, so we skipped dinner and drove instead to Valle
de la Luna to witness the desert bathed in sterling light. At the
summit, Javier emerged from the shadows toting pisco sours. There was
no escaping the stuff.</TE>
<TE>   At midnight we returned to the hotel to find that Miguel, the
gallant, had whipped up a platter of sushi.</TE>
<TE>   I am aware that things taste better when you have been seduced by
the magnificence of nature and have exerted yourself to the point of
delicious exhaustion. I know that travel makes things more flavorful,
more chimerical.</TE>
<TE>   But that was the best sushi I have ever eaten. Right there in the
middle of the driest desert on Earth.</TE>

<HD>3 Cruise Lines Slash Prices for Europe, the Mediterranean</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Times staff</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three luxury cruise lines are cutting prices by half or more on
Mediterranean cruises this summer and fall to lure American travelers
abroad.</LD>
<LD>   "Bookings have been very slow in the Mediterranean and Europe,"
said Jessica Agate, editor of CruiseReports, an industry publication.
"Consequently, cruise lines are doing heavy discounting."</LD>
<LD>   Among the deals:</LD>
<TE>   * Silversea Cruises (www.silver sea.com), considered an
ultra-luxury line, is offering an 11-day Barcelona-to-Athens trip for
$3,695 per person. The price before discounting was $7,395. Prices
for a seven-day Sept. 11 sailing from Athens to Nice will begin at
$2,495 instead of $4,995.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still hesitant to travel overseas," said spokesman
Brad Ball. "We're trying to get them traveling again--and we want
them to see our ships. So we're being very aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   * SeaDream Yacht Club (www.seadreamyachtclub.com), a new line that
features small, upscale ships, has marked down many of its
Mediterranean voyages by 50%. A seven-night June 15 cruise from Nice
to Barcelona is $2,100, down from $4,200.</TE>
<TE>   "Travelers are nervous. We're trying to overcome that," said
spokeswoman Ernie Beyl.</TE>
<TE>   * Crystal Cruises (www.crystalcruises.com) has a 12-day sailing on
Oct. 1 from Athens to Rome that has been cut from $6,390 per person
to $3,495."Business has been lighter in Europe this year, but people
are realizing it's a great time to take advantage of our prices,"
said spokeswoman Mimi Weisband.</TE>

<LD>FORT WORTH--Sharpshooter Annie Oakley, Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, singer Patsy Cline and artist Georgia O'Keeffe are
among those who will be honored this weekend when the National
Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame opens its expanded $21-million
facility.</LD>
<LD>   The museum honors 159 women who "exemplify the pioneer spirit of
the American West." Hall of Fame members include artists, writers,
entertainers, ranchers and rodeo cowgirls.</LD>
<LD>   Since its origination in the Texas panhandle town of Hereford in
1975, the museum has focused on the lives of Western women who have
distinguished themselves.</LD>
<TE>   O'Connor, an El Paso, Texas, native, grew up on her family's ranch
in southeastern Arizona, learning to ride, shoot and herd cattle. She
later attended Stanford Law School and served in the Arizona Senate
before becoming the first female member of the U.S. Supreme Court in
1981.</TE>
<TE>   The new museum, which includes three galleries, a theater and an
activities area for children, is closed Mondays and holidays. Hours
are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through
Saturdays and noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $6 for adults, $4
for children 6 to 18. (817) 336-4475, www.cowgirl.net.</TE>

customers a reason to frequent its Web page.</LD>
<LD>   Those are three reasons that make those airlines' Internet sites
favorites, according to Jupiter Media Metrix, which recently released
a study that measures consumer behavior.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, the top sites have done a nice job, making it easy to
book on their sites and making it a good experience," said Jared
Blank, a travel analyst for Jupiter. "The fares are displayed early
on in the process. If you have questions ... the phone number is
displayed, or an e-mail. They have components of a lot of things you
would want from a travel agent."</LD>
<TE>   Getting the lowest fare isn't the only reason why some people are
loyal to a particular airline's Web site. "What this index is about
is that there are things other than price," Blank said, including
customer service and the convenience of the flights. "It's all of
these things combined."</TE>

<HD>Life in the Slow Lane on Lopez Island</HD>
<DH>Two weary urbanites find that a journey to the San Juan
Islands in Washington can be short but sweet</DH>

<DL>LOPEZ ISLAND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Escorted by sea gulls and a cool, salty breeze, the ferry snaked
around evergreen-cloaked islands as passengers gathered on the front
deck to gape at Mt. Baker's volcanic dome.</LD>
<LD>   It was a view we almost missed. Before the ferry ride came a
flight to Seattle and a 90-minute drive north to Anacortes. It had
seemed like too much hassle for a weekend getaway, at least at first.</LD>
<LD>   But we gambled. By the time the boat pulled into Port Stanley, our
worries had vanished with the gulls.</LD>
<TE>   Last month John and I wanted a quiet place to celebrate our first
wedding anniversary and to unwind from weeks of overtime and
deadlines at work. Lopez Island--and the journey to it--proved to be
the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three main San Juan Islands, Lopez is the smallest and is
best known for its flat, bicycle-friendly roads and pastoral beauty.
(Orcas is the largest in the archipelago, and San Juan Island has the
bustling county seat.)</TE>
<TE>   Lopez Island's main village consists of little more than a food
market, three restaurants, a bakery, a thrift shop and a couple of
boutiques. Lest one forget the proximity to Seattle, two espresso
cafes and two bookstores (one new, one used) round out the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez also has the fewest accommodations, which increased our
chances of avoiding crowds. Our lodging looked like a bargain too: an
open-beamed cabin surrounded by cedar and fir groves for $89 plus tax
per night. Nearby was a waterfront gazebo and a small private beach
with another view of frosty Mt. Baker. This was the solace we sought.</TE>
<TE>   We flew to Seattle, drove toward the ferry and, anticipating
limited provisions on the island, detoured through Seattle's Pike
Place Market one Saturday morning for handmade ravioli, asparagus, a
baguette and sweet Washington apples. A sack of fryer-hot doughnuts
from the market's Daily Dozen Doughnut Co. topped off our menu.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of our visit, before school-is-out crowds had
descended on the San Juans, the chances of driving onto the first
ferry that showed up were good. (Peak-season round-trip fares are $27
for a car and driver, plus $9.60 for each additional passenger.)
Between the Fourth of July and Labor Day, we were told, those in the
know bring a book and a beach chair and show up early.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez Island is the closest to Anacortes, and after just 45
minutes on the ferry we pulled off in our rented sedan, passed the
scent of sizzling burgers at the Fogged Inn takeout counter and made
our way to the Blue Fjord Cabins on the island's southeast side.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-mile drive past cows, sheep and hand-painted "Eggs for
Sale" signs hints at Lopez's agricultural roots. Today the farms
visible from the road are more likely to be B&amp;Bs than poultry
producers, but the pastoral feel remains. We learned later that
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has poured millions into a compound
here with more than 25,000 square feet of living space, but the
291/2-square-mile island gives no hint of being a retreat for the
wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   With its "Lopez wave"--a half-wave exchanged by passing
motorists--and otherworldly respect for bike riders, the place more
closely resembles the quaintness of 1970s Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
or the sleepy friendliness of the rural South. Locals told us that
visitors in spring and fall tend to be stressed-out Seattleites, and
summer brings camping families and international travelers who stay
for a week or more.</TE>
<TE>   One of the two Blue Fjord Cabins was our home, a spacious
wood-paneled place with a queen bed, bathroom, kitchen and deck. (We
never saw the occupants of the other cabin.) The furnishings were
basic but comfortable, with some nice touches such as freshly ground
coffee and an accompanying pot. The rate was slightly lower than
those of other lodgings on the island, perhaps because of the
distance from the ferry.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping our bags, we considered our options: nap, hike or
watch the sunset from the beach. We happily chose all three, walking
to Shark Reef Park on the island's west side before dusk. We shared
the craggy rocks with another couple and watched dozens of seals
splashing around for fish, with San Juan Island stretching green and
shadowed in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   A wrong turn out of the park extended nature's show, and as we
stopped to turn around, two bald eagles soared in wing-extended
splendor.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is Lopez Island's unpretentiousness more evident than at
the Islander Waterfront Restaurant, where the simple menu consists of
steaks, burgers and other straightforward American fare. The service
is genially slow, the tables are full of unhurried customers, and
Foosball and pool tables at one side of the room encourage customers
to linger.</TE>
<TE>   Hungry after our sketchy brunch of doughnuts, we devoured the
house specialty of fish and chips--good, thick slabs of local halibut
and hand-cut potatoes--at a table overlooking Fisherman Bay marina.
Afterward we joined a crowd of Seattle Mariners fans ensconced in
front of a big-screen TV, never revealing that we wanted the visiting
Red Sox to win.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday we went to the north side of the island and hiked Spencer
Spit State Park's well-marked trails along the beach and into the
woods.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan to head over to San Juan Island's busier Friday Harbor
village was thwarted by our misconception that everything here must
operate on island time. The prompt 1:10 p.m. ferry, which takes
passengers and bicycles for free, was pulling away as we arrived, and
the next departure was three hours away.</TE>
<TE>   Instead we sought sustenance in slivers of Greek pizza at Holly
B's Bakery and exercise in a bicycle ride around the island. The Bike
Shop in the village rents all-terrain bikes or tandems--$25 for 12
hours, $30 for a full 24. For an extra $6, owner Margaret Devoe will
deliver the bikes to disembarking passengers at the ferry landing
three miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Gently rolling hills and interchanging views of water and shaded
forest made for a rewarding ride, although a desire to spend the last
couple of hours of daylight reading by the water kept us from
finishing the island's carefully marked 33-mile loop. Good rest stops
for the weary include the Lopez Island Vineyard &amp; Winery, which has a
tasting room and the oldest vineyard in the San Juans, and the tiny
Lopez Island Historical Museum, which chronicles the island's
transformation from Native American fishing and hunting ground to
prosperous farming community.</TE>
<TE>   If our cabin had been less inviting, our dining choice that
evening probably would have been the Love Dog Cafe in Lopez Village
for its enticing fish and pasta specials and candlelight setting.
(Its quirky name comes from a line in a poem by 13th century
philosopher Jalal ad-Din Rumi: "There are love dogs in this world no
one knows the names of, give your life to be one.")</TE>
<TE>   Instead, our anniversary toast came on the Blue Fjord's deck with
only Mt. Baker and a couple of sea otters as witnesses. We retired
well before our usual sleeping hour, knowing the ferry would arrive
early (and punctually) the next morning to return us to the big city.</TE>
<TE>   Back home we felt rested, invigorated and relatively confident
that next year's anniversary escape will involve a ferry ride and a
cabin with a view.</TE>

<LD>Life on the go with children can be a challenge, but these items may
make the experience easier and/or more fun. Prices do not include
shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Cub tub: Kel-Gar's new Snug-Tub Deluxe, designed for children who
can sit up unassisted through the toddler stage, is an inflatable
vinyl inner tub that is great when traveling. The 21-ounce Snug-Tub
fits inside a standard bathtub and measures 32 by 21 inches when
inflated. It folds to 9 by 7 by 2 inches thick. The tub has a
built-in vinyl ring-toss game and an inflatable fish that squeaks
when squeezed. There's a built-in drain plug and a suction cup so it
can be hung up to dry.</LD>
<LD>   Snug-Tub Deluxe is $23; (800) 388-1848, www.kelgar.com.</LD>

<TE>   Wild nights: This cute bear-head knapsack metamorphoses into a
cozy 57-by-30-inch children's sleeping bag when the innards are
pulled out. The bear head can be used as a pillow, and it has long
bear paws that accommodate a child's arms. The Snooze Zoo sleeping
bag has a fleece exterior and flannel lining. The animal head has
adjustable shoulder straps and three pockets for pajamas and
storybooks. It comes with a detachable mini flashlight and a stuffed
bear for cuddling. A leopard version also is available. Too bad they
don't make these for grown-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Snooze Zoo bear (item No. 10366) or leopard (No. 10365) is $74.95
from AJ Prindle &amp; Co.; (866) 774-8278, www.ajprindle.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safe transport: Booster seats are a must for toddlers in cars, but
what about youngsters who may be too small for safety belts but too
grown-up (at least in their own minds) for boosters? The SafeSit is a
plastic device that repositions a regular seat belt to fit a child.
Attaching at the point where the car's shoulder and lap belt meet, it
pulls the shoulder strap down and away from the child's head and neck
and keeps the lap belt at the hip so it doesn't ride over the
abdomen. The SafeSit fits children 50 pounds or more--about 5- to
8-year-olds--and easily detaches so you can transfer it from one car
to another.</TE>
<TE>   SafeSit seat belt adjuster is $19.95 from Blue Ridge
International; (800) 222-9056, www.safe fit.com.</TE>

<TE>   Family fix-up: Adventure Medical Kits, a manufacturer of first-aid
packs, has developed a kit for families. The Family II model has
materials to care for blisters and wounds and also includes bandages
with cartoon characters, diaper pins, syrup of ipecac to induce
vomiting after ingestion of poison, and a digital thermometer. A
50-page booklet, "Caring for Children in the Outdoors," addresses
health and safety issues of different age groups--how far a youngster
can be expected to hike, life-threatening pediatric circumstances,
correct medication dosages etc. The 9-by-6-by-2-inch-deep blue
zippered nylon bag has an external zippered pocket, built-in carry
straps and plastic belt loops.</TE>

like a sling (with a wide, padded adjustable strap), the lightweight
carrier has an internal harness with full body support along its
length. The infant is secured into the carrier before the adult puts
it on. The machine-washable carrier has an internal terry cloth
lining and pillow, two pockets for baby gear and a snap-together

<LD>Swimming, splashing and wading can make summer travels memorable,
whether the water of choice is a hotel pool, the ocean or a river or
stream.</LD>
<LD>   But of course, swimming is not without risks. Besides drowning,
the obvious hazard, there are rarer but still real risks such as
shark attack. Late last month, a surfer was attacked by a great white
shark at Stinson Beach in Northern California, reminding swimmers
that the ocean is not theirs alone.</LD>
<LD>   But a savvy swimmer can minimize the risks.</LD>
<TE>   To lessen the chance of drowning at hotel pools or at beaches,
swim in view of a lifeguard, says Brant Bass, a lifeguard lieutenant
with the City of San Diego Lifeguard Service. In fact, the U.S.
Lifesaving Assn.--with which the San Diego service is
affiliated--puts the risk of drowning at a beach overseen by USLA
lifeguards at 1 in 18 million.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking alcoholic beverages before or during swimming and other
water recreation substantially increases the chance of drowning,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Alcohol is involved in a quarter to half of all teen and adult deaths
associated with water recreation. In drownings of teen boys, alcohol
is involved half the time, the CDC estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol seems also to play a role in risky nighttime swimming in
the ocean, says John Everhart, a lifeguard sergeant with the San
Diego lifeguard service. "Intoxicated people will jump off the pier,"
he says, "often on a bet from their friends." Ocean swimming at
night--when no lifeguards are on duty--and swimming while inebriated
are high-risk activities, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Inexperience in ocean swimming creates another drowning risk. Pool
swimmers are often unfamiliar with rip currents, Bass says, and
swimmers who are just adequate in a pool are typically not very good
ocean swimmers. "You need to be a good, strong pool swimmer before
swimming in the ocean," he says. "Our last several drowning [victims]
have been very poor swimmers."</TE>
<TE>   Even a strong swimmer can get into trouble in rip
currents--seaward-going currents that can pull swimmers under.
"Eighty percent of our rescues, at least in San Diego, are in rip
currents," Bass says.</TE>
<TE>   How do you recognize a danger zone? "It's tough to give a blanket
statement of what a rip current looks like," Everhart says. "To the
untrained eye, it can look like the safest place to swim because the
waves are not breaking there [as they are in surrounding areas]."
Other warning signs, according to the CDC, include water that is
discolored, unusually choppy, foamy or filled with debris. And
suspect rip currents around big rocks or a pier, Everhart adds.</TE>
<TE>   If you find yourself in a rip current, Bass says you should "swim
parallel to the beach, toward any waves, and then in to shore." And
most of all, he says, try not to panic. "Signal the lifeguard you
need assistance by raising your arm and yelling," Everhart adds.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also suggest restricting ocean swimming to designated
areas, which are usually marked by buoys. Check the weather forecast
before heading out to do ocean swimming. Do not swim if you see
lightning, Everhart says.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't know whether an area is frequented by sharks, your
best bet is to ask the lifeguard, Bass says. Don't rely on hearsay
from other swimmers or surfers. Depending on your destination, he
also suggests asking about other ocean animals you might not want to
share the water with, such as stinging jellyfish.</TE>
<TE>   Everhart strongly cautions inexperienced swimmers to avoid rivers.
"Swimming in rivers is incredibly dangerous," he says, although most
travelers and swimmers don't realize it. "There's no letup in the
current. It can take you under or pin you against an object [near the
shore]. And I'm not aware of any rivers, at least in Southern
California, with lifeguards."</TE>

<HD>Following the Lesser-Known Path in Alta Laguna Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked between Laguna Beach and Laguna Hills, Aliso and Wood Canyons
Wilderness Park is a 4,000-acre reminder of what undeveloped Orange
County looked like a century ago. More than 30 miles of dirt roads
and trails wind past the park's canyons, ridges, oak woodlands and
year-round creeks.</LD>
<LD>   Most visitors use the Alicia Parkway entrance and begin their
adventures from the canyon bottoms. But I'm going to discuss a less
crowded way to go: from a second trail head at Alta Laguna Park,
perched atop a ridge on the west boundary of Aliso and Wood Canyons
Wilderness Park. Handsome little Alta Laguna has water, restrooms, a
picnic area, a play area for the kids and plenty of parking--not to
mention superb views.</LD>
<LD>   Hikers should be warned that the Aliso and Wood Canyons park is
popular with mountain bicyclists. Beginning riders cruise the nearly
flat canyon bottoms, and advanced riders careen down steep ridgelines
and along rocky tracks shared with hikers. Pedestrians have the right
of way but still need to keep an eye out.</LD>
<TE>   The route I'm suggesting can be shortened or lengthened according
to your time and inclination. Four trails extend from the park's West
Ridge and offer loops of varying lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From Pacific Coast Highway
(California 1) in Laguna Beach, drive east on Park Avenue and climb
two miles. At Alta Laguna Boulevard, turn left. After a block, turn
right into Alta Laguna Park.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The most eager among us can get right to the hike by
stepping out onto wide West Ridge Trail, but I recommend following
the more roundabout trail to Carolynn Wood View Knoll and taking in
the panoramic vistas. You'll see Laguna Beach to the south, the Palos
Verdes Peninsula to the north, and San Clemente and Santa Catalina
islands to the west. Gaze east to the San Joaquin Hills and the
communities of Aliso Viejo and Lake Forest; behind the hills and
suburbs rise the Santa Ana Mountains and their two most distinctive
peaks, Modjeska and Santiago, which form Old Saddleback. On a clear
day, hikers may be able to pick out Mt. Wilson and Mt. Baldy.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to slope restoration efforts, these hilltops are healing
from off-road vehicle use from before the creation of the park. While
enjoying the view, realize that the knoll's purpose is more
utilitarian than aesthetic: Below ground is a reservoir containing
about 3 million gallons of water.</TE>
<TE>   My 5-year-old son recently wandered off the trail and began
shouting "Goats! Goats with big horns!" I figured Daniel's overactive
imagination had kicked in again or, uh-oh, I had kept him out in the
sun too long. But sure enough, dozens of goats were nibbling the
brush--low-tech vegetation thinning in advance of fire season.</TE>
<TE>   From atop the knoll, a path corkscrews down to a spur road
connecting to West Ridge Trail. A half-mile descent leads north to a
park bulletin board, bench and signed intersection with Mathis Canyon
Trail. If you're not up for a long hike, retrace your steps back to
the car.</TE>
<TE>   If you're game, follow Mathis Canyon Trail as it drops southwest
quickly. It's a hairy ride for mountain bikers and even steep for
hikers. The trail finally levels out, and a better-graded dirt road
leads to the grassy, oak-dotted bottom of Mathis Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Turn north on Wood Canyon Trail through the heart of the
wilderness park. Follow the mellow path along a seasonal creek,
gently climbing 21/2 miles to the north end of the park and a
junction with Cholla Trail. Bear left and head up Cholla Trail to the
ridgeline. Return to your starting point with a final 21/2-mile walk
along West Ridge Trail.*</TE>

<HD>Getting Lost in the Web of Internet Fare Searches</HD>
<DH>Simultaneous test runs for identical itineraries on
selected sites yield very different results. Hint: Be flexible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My task seemed straightforward: Search Internet sites for the lowest
round-trip air fare between LAX and Chicago's Midway Airport
departing May 30, returning June 3.</LD>
<LD>   But of course, it wasn't.</LD>
<LD>   I used www.expedia.com and www.travelocity.com and the
airline-owned www.orbitz.com, plus some individual airline sites and
Sidestep, a program that retrieves low fares on the Internet sites of
airlines, consolidators and other sources. (You can download it free
at www.sidestep.com.) I performed the searches May 9 within a
half-hour of each other.</LD>
<TE>   I'll put aside for the moment who won the race. Here are some of
the lessons I learned:</TE>
<TE>   Now you see it, now you don't: That's what happened with a
Southwest Airlines $195 fare from LAX to Midway nonstop that I found
with Sidestep. When I searched for fares for one person, the $195
ticket was displayed. When I searched for fares for two travelers, it
wasn't; instead, a $200 Northwest Airlines fare was the cheapest.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen this happen every now and again," says Phil Carpenter,
vice president of marketing for Sidestep. There's no way to know what
was going on, he concedes, because fares may change minute by minute
under the complex "yield management" system that many airlines use to
raise prices as demand rises. But he speculates that the $195 seat
was the last one available at that rate on that flight.</TE>
<TE>   "Yield management seems to be more of a black art than science,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson: Different variables create different results. Furthermore,
if you see a fare you like, book it because it may not be there two
minutes hence. (This creates difficulty for readers of The Times'
Travel section's weekly "Lowest Air Fares" chart, which is compiled
several days before the Sunday paper arrives on the doorstep. Many
low fares may be sold out by then.)</TE>
<TE>   Giving it another try, I enlisted my colleagues May 24 to search
for the lowest round-trip fares between LAX and New York's JFK,
departing June 22 and returning June 29. To the sites above we added
www.trip.com and www.hotwire.com, an airline-owned site that displays
fares without specifying the airline and exact times until after you
make the nonrefundable booking. We did all our searches within half
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   We turned up more aberrations and frustrations. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   The special fare that wasn't there: I saw a $258 round-trip
LAX-JFK fare under "Fare Sales by City" on America West's site,
www.americawest.com. I could click on the price or on another button
called "Book It!" When I clicked on "Book It!" and chose my flights
from a list the site generated, the fare was $373.02. When I clicked
on "$258RT," the site sent me to a page where no such fare was
listed.</TE>
<TE>   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack says the $258 figure
indicates that fares start at $258, but that low price may not be
available on all flights. "I know it's a pretty arcane system,"
Nowack says. She did not know why the "$258RT" link didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson: Things aren't always what they seem, so don't do the
low-fare celebratory dance until you've booked it.</TE>
<TE>   It's all a matter of time: Southwest, known for low fares, is also
known for withholding its fares from other Internet sites. Had I
relied on Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity in my LAX-Chicago search, I
would have missed what was apparently the cheapest flight,
Southwest's; only Sidestep showed me Southwest fares.</TE>
<TE>   But I was surprised that in the LAX-JFK search, America West, at
under $300, showed up as the low fare on Expedia, Sidestep and Trip
.com but not on Orbitz, where the lowest fare was $390 (using
American and United), or Travelocity, where the lowest fare was
$361.42 using a "name-brand airline" that it didn't identify.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz spokeswoman Carol Jouzaitis says the America West fare
probably failed to show up because we entered specific flight times
(10 a.m. outbound, 3 p.m. return) in our search. In that case, Orbitz
searches flights two hours before and after the specified times. At
1:55 p.m., the America West departure was outside that time window.
It was a similar story at Travelocity, where we specified "within two
hours" on the departure. Of course, we had entered the same flight
times on Expedia and Trip.com--and we got the America West fare.
These two sites, plus Sidestep, appeared to cast a wider net when
times were entered.</TE>
<TE>   Jouzaitis suggests customers search for "anytime" or use the
default settings of the sites to increase the chance of getting a
24-hour search of options. "Once you put in times, we're searching
different stuff because we seem to be using different assumptions,"
she says of the travel sites.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, each Internet site has its own search
paths: some by city, some by airport, some by hour, some by general
time of day. You can't make exactly comparable searches.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson: If you're looking for the lowest fare, be as flexible on
your times (and even departure and arrival cities) as the site
allows.</TE>
<TE>   Let us count the ways: Orbitz, Sidestep, Travelocity and Trip.com
displayed our flight choices as round trips. But with Expedia, we had
to first choose our departing flight, then the return flight, with
potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of combinations. We found the
process tedious. But Suzi LeVine, Expedia's director of product
marketing, says research shows that customers, especially business
travelers, prefer to choose the flights separately. She points out
that one of the eight boxes displayed above fare searches, labeled
"Top Picks," will display round-trip options if you click on it.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson: Click on all the little boxes or combinations of boxes.
You never know what you'll find.</TE>
<TE>   The whole process of searching various sites was frustrating in
its complexities and idiosyncrasies. "We have to guess what your
needs are," Orbitz's Jouzaitis says in explaining why different sites
display things differently.</TE>
<TE>   As for the scores: For the LAX-Midway round trip, Sidestep found
the lowest fare, $195, on Southwest. For the LAX-JFK round trip,
Hotwire was lowest, at $259, if you were willing to buy without
knowing the times or the airlines; otherwise it was Expedia by a
nose, with a $291 America West fare.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention we enlisted a travel agent in the LAX-JFK search?
Using a computerized reservation system, or CRS, available only to
agents, she spotted two America West fares, one $293.50 and another
$268, which was labeled an "instant purchase fare."</TE>
<TE>   When I called America West and the CRS operator, spokeswomen there
told me they had never heard of such a fare.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although we have traveled extensively, one of our favorite places
remains Cambria and, in particular, Moonstone Beach ("Cambria's
Seaside Stage," Weekend Escape, May 26). For many years we have
visited there at least once a year, and we always stay at the
Fireside Inn. We walk on the cliffs, savor the sea air and watch the
sunset.</LD>
<LD>   We have dinner at the Sea Chest and were surprised you were
disappointed. We think it is one of the best seafood restaurants we
have known. Maybe the chefs were having a bad day. Give it another
try.</LD>
<LD>   Incidentally, the first time we were in the Sea Chest years ago
was for dinner as we drove north on Highway 1 to Carmel. Sitting at
the counter with his wife was Otis Chandler, digging into some fresh
oysters. I was impressed. If the Sea Chest was good enough for the
then-publisher of The Times, it was surely good enough for me. Your
article inspired us to plan another visit. We will stay at the
Fireside Inn and dine at the Sea Chest.</LD>

<TE>   My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Fireside Inn in
December. Unbeknownst to the (extremely pleasant) hotel clerk, we
were celebrating a special wedding anniversary. Without requesting it
and at no additional cost, we were given one of the three
ocean-facing rooms. This made for a truly special visit.</TE>

<HD>Miramar No More</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maureen Foster's letter ("Nostalgia for a Santa Barbara Resort," May
26) about missing the Miramar in Santa Barbara made me want to weep,
as I do every time I drive north into Santa Barbara and look for the
dear, familiar blue sign beckoning from the beach side just before
the San Ysidro exit. Alas, no more sign, no more lolling on the
beachfront deck waiting for room service to deliver the BLTs, and no
more reasonably priced access to the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   In its last year, I made a point to stay at the Miramar several
times, and drove up just for lunch the week the dining room was to
close, to dine before all the silverware disappeared as souvenirs.</LD>
<LD>   Now, painful as it is, I always get off at San Ysidro and drive
along the construction fence, where the old bungalows sit forlornly
and the deserted beachfront buildings still face the gorgeous waves.
It breaks my heart that so many loyal Miramar fans could have enjoyed
her graces for so much longer had not greed been the driving force.</LD>

<LD>The acacia photo (My Best Shot, May 26) caught my attention. I too
traveled to Kenya and Tanzania at a tense time: two weeks after the
embassies were bombed. The Tanzanians couldn't have been friendlier.
It is a wonderful country to visit, and they sorely need our tourist
dollars.</LD>

<HD>Dishing Up the World in Melbourne</HD>
<DH>Ethnic cuisines spice up this Aussie city that's home to
more than 100 nationalities</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM ZETTER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Sydney and Melbourne have long been rivals in everything from
business and culture to weather and sports. Sydneysiders crack that
the only good thing to come out of Melbourne is the Hume Highway
exiting town. Melburnians point out that the same highway, which
connects the two cities, also comes out of Sydney.</LD>
<LD>   But if the two cities didn't have enough to bicker about already,
they now can add food to the list.</LD>
<LD>   Food is a national obsession in Australia, and the talent of some
of the nation's chefs has put the island continent on the culinary
map.</LD>
<TE>   The trend began in Sydney in the '80s with world-class results,
but Melbourne is trying to grab the baton. The number of food
festivals, markets and restaurants in the city attests to its
fixation.</TE>
<TE>   But the real surprise is not the gourmet offerings of this former
culinary wasteland; it's the variety of its ethnic cuisines.</TE>
<TE>   Housing a mix of more than 100 nationalities, the city has food
and flavors to match. And it's all set against a Victorian backdrop
of manicured gardens, turn-of-the-century trams and houses adorned
with intricate iron lace balconies.</TE>
<TE>   With 2,500 restaurants in Melbourne, you'll find everything from
Balinese to Lebanese, Fijian to Greek, along with a generous helping
of modern Australian (a fusion of local produce and foreign spices
using classic French, Italian and Asian cooking techniques).</TE>
<TE>   Even better for Americans is the value, since the Aussie dollar is
worth only about 56 U.S. cents.</TE>
<TE>   When I spent four weeks with friends in Melbourne in February, I
had just been laid off from a job, so the prospect of inexpensive
eats was appealing. And coming from San Francisco, where the ethnic
offerings are not always as varied as you would expect, I was
interested in trying a range of flavors.</TE>
<TE>   My first stop, though, was a conventional one. Lygon Street is the
city's version of Little Italy, packed with family-run restaurants
serving heavily sauced tourist fare.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration waves, following relaxation of the White Australia
policy after World War II (it wasn't completely abandoned until the
1970s), have deposited a number of other ethnic enclaves around the
city: Little Saigon on Victoria Street in Richmond; Chinatown in the
CBD (Central Business District); the Greek section of Lonsdale
Street; the Ottoman Empire (Turks and Lebanese) on Sydney Road in
Brunswick; and Bollywood (Indian) in Dandenong. Not to mention the
burgeoning industrial neighborhood of Footscray, home to Vietnamese
and Ethiopians.</TE>
<TE>   As I walked down Lygon weaving a path around waiters and
pedestrians, an Italian barker cooed softly from his doorway perch.
"Ciao, bella," he said, gesturing toward an empty pavement table that
apparently had my name on it.</TE>
<TE>   But on this hot summer night, passing the gantlet of restaurant
hawkers, all I wanted was gelato. I found my treasure at Casa del
Gelato, a gelateria with the warmth of a neighborhood pub. Standing
on the corner and scooping the cool, creamy mounds from a cone--peach
and ricotta, two specialty flavors of Casa del Gelato owner Ottorino
Pace--I could smell the thick aroma of toasty espresso and sauteed
garlic in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The capital of the state of Victoria, Melbourne was founded by
John Batman in 1835 as a British outpost and purchased for a pittance
from Aborigines who made their home on the mud flats of the Yarra
River. Named after Lord Melbourne, Britain's prime minister from 1835
to '41, it was Australia's capital from 1901 to 1927, before
Parliament moved to Canberra. Despite Sydney's iconic opera house,
Melbourne, with 3.2 million residents, stakes a strong claim to being
the country's intellectual and artistic hub. Add to this its numerous
parks, relaxed attitude and multicultural edge, and it's easy to see
why so many immigrants prefer it to Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   And Melbourne has many other attractions beyond its food.
Moonlight Cinema, in the city's 157-year-old Royal Botanic Garden
alongside the Yarra River, is a great mix of bucolic setting and
celluloid classics. The city is also mad for sports. If the townies
aren't gearing up for the Australian Open tennis tournament or
Australian Formula One Grand Prix--a loud spectacle that runs through
town--then footy (Australian Rules football), bike riding, sailing
and golf consume them.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Melbourne, the countryside offers spectacular views along
the Great Ocean Road, which rivals Highway 1 in California. Or you
can take bicycle tours of the country's renowned Yarra Valley
wineries; swim and surf along the Mornington Peninsula; take a day
trip to Phillip Island to see the nightly parade of waddling penguins
as they emerge from the sea; or observe other pudgy critters at the
Koala Conservation Centre.</TE>
<TE>   Following my brief Italian sojourn on Lygon, my friend Paul and I
decided to head to the city center for Greek food. Melbourne is said
to have the largest Greek population outside Athens. Feeding these
Mediterranean appetites is a host of restaurants ranging from
traditional tavernas serving souvlakia and saganaki to more modern
venues mixing it up with kangaroo and octopus.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best Greek restaurants is Kri Kri Mezethopoleion. Named
after a type of endangered goat on the island of Crete, Kri Kri
bravely infiltrated Chinatown a couple of years ago and has been
holding its own among the dim sum establishments ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Mezethopoleion ("the place for small dishes") refers to meze,
tapas-style items that let you sample many flavors. At Kri Kri we had
a mini feast: a creamy fava bean puree and a deliciously chewy
saganaki (cheese coated in flour and fried), followed by zucchini
fritters, tender lamb cutlets and eggplant with spicy olives and
feta. Loukoumades (honeyed fritters with walnuts) completed the meal.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of dim sum, no culinary experience in Melbourne would be
complete without this Chinese tradition. So one morning I headed to
the banks of the Yarra. The city is filled with Chinese restaurants
offering yum cha ("drink tea") sessions, generally between 11 a.m.
and 3 p.m. But Red Emperor, with its split-level dining room and
beautiful river views, is one of the best.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived early and watched as dozens of bamboo baskets rolled
from the kitchen. The trick was to resist filling up on satay and
spring rolls early in the game, to save room for the prawn dumplings
and pork buns that came later.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Australia's South Pacific location, a world of exotic
ingredients fills its menus and stores. At an Asian market on
Victoria Street, I found tapioca sticks and hard brown rounds of palm
sugar twice the size of a hockey puck. There were also dried fish
lips and mussels in plastic bags. Produce markets are stocked with
unusual tropical fare, too: breadfruit, purple passion fruit and
plump, red, succulent dragon pearl fruit. There's also durian, which
reportedly "tastes like heaven and stinks like hell." The fruit has
rubbery porcupine-type quills and dense, rich flesh that tastes like
a cross between cream cheese and onion.</TE>
<TE>   Because 90% of Australians live along a coast, there is also an
abundance of interesting and fresh seafood, such as barramundi fish,
Balmain bugs (like lobster), parrotfish, eel, Queensland mud crab,
yabbies (freshwater crayfish) and blue swimmer crabs.</TE>
<TE>   For my next culinary venture, I decided to go Balinese and visited
Warung Agus. A warung, in Bali, is a casual place where neighbors
gather to gossip and eat. The restaurant fits this description and at
the same time is an oasis of color and warmth in a gray part of town.
Consisting of two small rooms adorned with bright fabrics and
handicrafts, the family-owned venue is redolent of spices and
tropical flowers.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Jackie and I began with a platter of perfectly cooked
calamari. Then we tried biri biri panggang (juicy lamb in a fragrant
tamarind and palm sugar sauce) and quail stuffed with lemongrass,
candlenut and ginger. All the while, a steady stream of the house
specialty floated by our table--fish fillets baked in foil, seasoned
with lemon and a mix of spices.</TE>
<TE>   Staying in the same culinary region, I went a few nights later to
Lemongrass, an upscale restaurant that features Thai royal cuisine.
This type of food is time consuming to prepare, requiring that each
dish look as artful as it tastes. Lemongrass meets this requirement
with impressive results, but the royal treatment can be pricey ($22
for a scampi dish).</TE>
<TE>   Paul and I ordered mieng kanah, a dish consisting of fresh kai lan
leaves that diners layer with toasted coconut, cashews, lime wedges,
pomelo and ginger and drizzle with a palm sugar and shrimp paste
sauce before wrapping and eating. Each bite delivered a burst of
sweet, sour and bitter flavors and a mix of textures.</TE>
<TE>   Having eaten my fill of Asian food, I turned to the Middle East in
search of the perfect tabbouleh. I found it at Abla's.</TE>
<TE>   Abla is Abla Amad, owner of a 20-year-old landmark and author of
"The Lebanese Kitchen." Her fresh, light tabbouleh set everything
right in the world. In fact, she has gone on record as saying the
cracked wheat salad has the same restorative powers as chicken soup.
She's also known for a sweet chicken and rice dish with almonds and
spice. And don't leave her dining room without trying kibbeh nayeh, a
Lebanese version of steak tartare.</TE>
<TE>   Middle Eastern food is popular in Melbourne, so on my last night I
went with friends to Kilim Turkish Restaurant, another relaxed place
with tented interior, kilim-covered walls and embroidered pillows.</TE>
<TE>   We ordered the meze platter with seven savory, colorful dips,
including the piquant pancar (mashed beets, yogurt and garlic) and
biber (red pepper, yogurt and garlic) served with fingers of pide, a
soft, focaccia-like bread. Then we tried chili mussels in white wine,
and iskender--thin strips of grilled lamb tossed with seasoned tomato
chunks and cool garlic yogurt laid over crunchy bread. Each bite was
smoky and tart.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, as we closed the restaurant, I thought back over my
whirlwind culinary tour. I was, as they say Down Under, one happy
little Vegemite.</TE>

<AU>JAMES DANNENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A criminal, it is said, often returns to the scene of his crime. I
can attest to that, at least in my case. I don't even have to return,
actually; the evidence of my mischief greets me every day, sitting
snugly in a corner near my computer, haunting me even as I type these
words.</LD>
<LD>   I'm looking at a dull gray block of stone, perhaps 6 inches,
chiseled into a rounded shape and weighing about 8 pounds. The side
on which it rests is flat, rising like a pyramid that seems to nestle
into a pair of curved horns. From one perspective, it looks like a
pedestal bearing a ram's head or perhaps seashells.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't meant to rest on the floor. No, this piece of carved
stone originally adorned the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   You may well ask how this priceless part of French history, hewn
from rock centuries ago by some anonymous artisan toiling to please
his exalted God, came to reside in my study in Kailua on the windward
side of Oahu.</TE>
<TE>   I stole it.</TE>
<TE>   In my defense--and, as a judge, I know something about this--I
might argue that I was young, that I was under duress, that I meant
no real harm. But judgment is yet to be rendered, and if brought to
the bar I would likely plead no contest.</TE>
<TE>   My first visit to Paris was in 1964, when I was a callow youth of
19 from Wisconsin. It was an ill-fated trip from the beginning. It
was my first trip abroad, and I immediately experienced an aching
combination of culture shock and homesickness that colored every
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Even London, my first stop, seemed sinister and hostile. Crossing
the channel to France weaned me from the meager linguistic comfort of
understanding--for the most part--what people were saying.</TE>
<TE>   This was the France of Charles de Gaulle, then in the process of
withdrawing from NATO and kicking American air bases off sovereign
French soil. Never mind that we had saved his cookies during World
War II. Never mind that we were lining up to spend millions of
dollars in tourist revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The official line was that Americans were Coca-Cola-swilling
bumpkins with too much power and money, and the French weren't about
to like us.</TE>
<TE>   By this time I had linked up with a traveling companion, my old
school pal Doug, and acquired a car, a Hillman Imp. Once in Paris,
however, there wasn't much to do other than park it and find a cheap
hotel, the cheaper the better. (My collection of parking tickets
might well have broken the bank had I paid them, but I managed to
avoid "le Denver boot.")</TE>
<TE>   We found a hotel on the Left Bank, on the Rue St. Jacques near the
Pantheon. "Dingy" would be too bright an adjective for the place, but
it seemed OK to a couple of college boys. The bare lightbulbs
illuminating the stairwells and hallways were on timer switches so
finely tuned as to force a sprint to the next switch to avoid a
blackout. The beds bowed like hammocks. The facilities were down the
hall, and in those days the French had a long way to go to catch up
to America in the plumbing and toilet-paper department. Fortunately,
our room had a little sink that allowed for the occasional full-body
sponge bath.</TE>
<TE>   We spent most of our days walking around the town, stopping in
museums, marveling at landmarks and attractions, and grousing about
the girlfriends we'd left at home.</TE>
<TE>   Doug's French was pretty good, certainly much better than mine.
Yet it seemed that everyone we ran into, from hotel clerks to waiters
to folks from whom we asked directions, had difficulty understanding
us. And when they did understand, they mocked our accents and usage.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that 1964 was the summer the civil rights movement
kicked into high gear. I remember a fleeting image on French TV of
officials dragging the car of three slain civil rights workers out of
a Mississippi swamp.</TE>
<TE>   The French, it seemed, were critical of America's record on race
relations, and we endured more than one lecture. We felt passionately
about civil rights, so the lectures rang hollow, especially because
we could see that Africans (and Arabs) in Paris seemed to fare no
better than minorities did in the American South.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the food.</TE>
<TE>   It was in this area that the cultural divide between France and my
adolescent America most clearly manifested itself. In 1964 most of
America was strictly meat and potatoes. France was definitely
undiscovered culinary country for these two Midwestern boys.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything on the menus seemed strange, unfathomable and
foreign in all senses of the word. We usually went for the
conservative, finding solace in the few familiar items we could make
out. Omelets and steak frites made up a substantial part of our diet.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we should have been more adventurous, but our situation
had deteriorated to the point where we were prepared to do cultural
battle with the Gallic philistines. Waiters preferred to sneer at our
food quandary rather than guide us through the gateway to gustatory
revelation. Well, if we wanted Coca-Cola with our dinners, that might
be cause for derision in their eyes, but we came to feel that we were
defending our national identity with such gestures. The lines were
drawn.</TE>
<TE>   It also didn't help that we were cheap.</TE>
<TE>   One evening it all came to a head when we were dining in a Chinese
restaurant. We had eaten there before, mainly because it was
inexpensive. After we ordered our usual--egg rolls and rice--we
noticed that the waiter, a Chinese man who also mocked our French,
was engaged in a heated discussion with the manager. He then came
over to our table and said, in French, "You don't order enough. You
have to leave."</TE>
<TE>   It took a while to figure out what he was saying, but when we
realized they were kicking us out, we were dumbfounded. I admit we
were cheap, but the place wasn't full, and we were otherwise
presentable. I actually wore a corduroy sport coat, didn't have long
hair and had recently bathed.</TE>
<TE>   The injustice was not lost on us, and we were quick to see this
humiliation as part of a broader cultural conspiracy. We were
innocent Americans set upon by Old World bullies unappreciative of
our selfless touristic gesture, not to mention our saving their bacon
in the war.</TE>
<TE>   We walked the streets of the Left Bank in despair, reminding each
other how much we disliked this heartless city, when we found
ourselves behind Notre Dame. A gate was open, and spread out on the
ground were numerous stone objects, apparently part of a renovation
project. There were gargoyles and other stone pieces that had
obviously fallen off or been removed from the cathedral walls. Doug
joked that we ought to take one of the gargoyles just to spite them.
They were far too big, weighing hundreds of pounds. But I noticed a
smaller piece in a corner and, without thinking, snatched it up and
carried it all the way to the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Back in our room it dawned on us that we had probably broken
numerous laws and might end up spending the rest of our youthful
years in a French jail, an unattractive idea. Returning the piece
seemed risky, and we weren't about to turn ourselves in. We couldn't
mail the thing home. It was too heavy for our luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Because I was planning to ship the car home, I simply put the
piece in the trunk. If it disappeared on the way, as I fully
expected, that would be that.</TE>
<TE>   Leapfrogging to the end of that chapter, when I got my car back a
few months later, I found my chunk of Notre Dame in the trunk, just
where I had left it. Nearly 38 years later I still have it.</TE>
<TE>   Attitudes change. People change. Ironies abound.</TE>
<TE>   After those dark days as a cultural refugee, I vowed never to
venture past the U.S. border again. How quickly a few years and a
little experience can change one's perspective. In time I came to
appreciate French history, culture and, of course, cuisine. Over the
years I have returned to France at least 20 times, exploring
virtually every corner of that beautiful country. My French still
isn't very good, but I can get by. Contrary to my earlier experience
and to contemporary mythology, most French folks have been friendly
and helpful. There is much to love about the place.</TE>
<TE>   Mind you, I wouldn't call myself a Francophile. The French are as
weird as any people, and every culture has its darker corners, but
these days I don't trip over myself trying to find them.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements in French plumbing and a strong dollar haven't hurt
either.</TE>
<TE>   My French malaise was mostly of my own making. I was the victim of
my own bad attitude, as are many tourists who travel to a foreign
destination in hopes of finding what they already have at home.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me back to the evidence of my ancient transgression.
So now that I've come clean, exactly what am I to do with my little
piece of historical plunder?</TE>
<TE>   These days folks seem sensitive about the removal of national
treasures, and for good reason. Whether it's the theft of icons from
Angkor Wat in Cambodia or the poaching of threatened animal species
for body parts, there is little to debate about this seamy traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But is there some sort of statute of limitations at work here? The
British Museum has no intention of returning the Elgin Marbles to
Greece, nor has the Louvre offered to repatriate its ancient Egyptian
collection. On the other hand, museums in the U.S. and elsewhere are
still confronting the problem of art stolen during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   I admit to having grown fond of my piece of history, but in the
end I suppose I will return it if I can figure out a reasonable way
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Though I'm no longer worried about confronting the gendarmes, I
think it's safe to say that I have rehabilitated myself. I appreciate
the wrongfulness of my juvenile acts and have come to respect the
culture toward which I showed such immature disdain.</TE>
<TE>   And I hardly ever order Coca-Cola with dinner anymore.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: "A handy hammock"--that's what Leo Wozniak calls this
makeshift siesta spot at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport.
The Pomona resident was lining up to board a plane in February when
he and his wife, Sally, noticed the scene out the window. Although
the napper seemed mighty relaxed, other employees worked hard to
accommodate travelers in light of new security measures, Wozniak
says. "Exceptionally patient" airline agents at the gate kept older
fliers at ease while their bags were searched, and screeners at a
security checkpoint were polite and efficient--and thorough enough to
find a key-chain-size Swiss Army knife that Wozniak had accidentally
left in his wife's purse.</CP>

<HD>Forget the Explorers Club if You Need to Ask 'How Risky?'
or 'How Much?'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not easy to get into the Explorers Club. Robert E. Peary and
Matthew Henson had to make it to the North Pole, doing so on April 6,
1909. Oceanographer Robert Ballard found the wreck of the Titanic in
1985, Sir Edmund Hillary climbed Mt. Everest in 1953 and Thor
Heyerdahl sailed from Peru to Polynesia on a raft in 1947.</LD>
<LD>   For a less daring traveler like me, getting accepted into the
Explorers Club is the stuff of fantasy. The august group was
incorporated in 1905 in New York as something of a gentlemen's club
where big-game hunters and adventurers gathered to swap stories, says
John Reilly, a mountaineer, historian and 21-year member. Now it has
about 3,000 members, most of them field researchers seeking
information about the world.</LD>
<LD>   Currently members are searching for U.S. military aircraft lost
during World War II in the Pacific islands of Palau, crossing the
frozen Bering Strait in a specially designed off-road vehicle,
testing deep-water submersibles in the Bahamas and descending the
18,000-foot inner gorge of the Zangbo River in southern Tibet.</LD>
<TE>   "People want to get in because they've climbed Everest or been to
the North Pole," says club President Richard Wiese, a naturalist and
documentary filmmaker. "But in this day and age, that doesn't mean
anything. We're more interested in someone digging in the La Brea Tar
Pits or studying butterflies in Griffith Park."</TE>
<TE>   Members, it seems, must also have adventurous palates. Wiese says
the instinct to explore can be correlated with one's willingness to
eat exotic dishes--that is, saying "Yes, I'll try it" when offered a
plate of mealy worms.</TE>
<TE>   Eating exotic food has become a cocktail hour ritual at the club's
annual dinner in March at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Last year
tempura-fried Chilean rose tarantula in ponzu sauce was on the menu.
Some guests ended up in the emergency room after developing allergic
reactions to the South American treat, which should have had the hair
removed before cooking, it was later discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Membership has other privileges, including the chance to meet
famous people at club functions: oceanographer Sylvia Earle,
astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard, who made
the first nonstop balloon flight around the world in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are thousands of other members doing amazing work ...
who aren't so well known," says Lesley Ewing, head of the Northern
California chapter. "It's always energizing to meet them and talk
about your plans. They never say 'Impossible' or 'That's already been
done.'"</TE>
<TE>   Members also are given access to club headquarters, which are in a
landmark Tudor Revival townhouse on New York's Upper West Side. Some
years ago I was lucky enough to get a tour. I saw the first-floor
lounge, where members gather for drinks. At the rear of the lobby is
the globe Heyerdahl used to chart the course of the Kon-Tiki across
the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The bell from the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Bear, used by Adm.
Richard E. Byrd on his second expedition to Antarctica from 1933 to
1935, rings in all club events, including the vaguely cabalistic
tribute ceremonies in which members line the building's staircases,
holding candles and whispering the name of the honoree. Then they
gather by the fireplace in the library, drink a toast and dash their
cognac snifters into the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Peary's sledge is on the third floor. A photograph of the
ill-fated expedition to the Arctic led by Adolphus W. Greely, which
started with 25 men in 1881 and ended with seven in 1884, is on the
fourth, and the bulk of the library on the fifth. It has about 5,000
maps and 22,000 volumes, including a pristine copy of "La Description
de l'Egypte," commissioned by Napoleon and published between 1809 and
1825. Also in the library are reports by members who have carried the
Explorers Club flag all over the globe and beyond, including a 2002
trip on the space shuttle Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Club flags are given to members embarking on nonprofit
expeditions; a flag can be reused when another club-approved trip
comes up. Flag 14, for instance, went from Chiapas to the Yucatan in
Mexico in 1927, into deep water with oceanographer Ballard and to the
top of Mt. Everest in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   For nonmembers the club sponsors lectures and a documentary film
series on conservation, exploration and science at the New York
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Both give members and other featured speakers the chance to
exercise their storytelling skills--the "I went over the mountain and
you'll never guess what I saw" part of their job as explorers, says
club President Wiese.</TE>
<TE>   If you have plenty of cash, you can consider going on an adventure
with the Explorers Club Travelers, which offers about 10 trips a year
to amazing places. The tour company was the first to take clients on
a circumnavigation of Antarctica and to see the wreck of the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming trips include a visit to the German battleship Bismarck,
sunk in 1941 and lying at a depth of 15,000 feet between England and
France (July 25 to Aug. 8, $28,000, excluding air fare), and another
Antarctic circumnavigation on the polar icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov
(Nov. 26 to Feb. 1, for $34,950). For more information, contact
Explorers Club Travelers, P.O. Box 938, 47 Main St., Suite 1,
Walpole, NH 03608; (800) 856-8951, www.explorers.org.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it costs dearly to travel in the footsteps of Explorers
Club members. I would rather read about their exploits and get
someone to let me into the lounge for a drink in front of the
fireplace.</TE>

<LD>If you are a student or an independent or budget-minded traveler,
Canada has a number of ways to save while seeing the country this
summer.</LD>
<LD>   A three-day backpacker excursion from Calgary into grizzly bear
territory and a four-day backpacker trip from the city of Vancouver
to Vancouver Island (where you may be able to whale-watch and hike in
a 1,000-year-old forest) are two of the opportunities for adventurers
traveling student-style who want to explore the Canadian wilderness
this summer.</LD>
<LD>   True North Tours is best known for its six-day backpacker minivan
tours through the Canadian Rockies. Its Rockies tour, called the
Rocky Express, picks up travelers at hostels in Calgary, Banff and
Lake Louise and takes them on a scenic ride through the mountains,
visiting the Columbia Ice Fields (which are larger than the
44-square-mile city of Vancouver), searching for wildlife and
stopping for hikes and other mountain activities. For about $138, you
will get transportation, guide services and park entrance fees.
Five-night hostel accommodation packages are available for $51.50.
Passengers must contribute $13 to a food kitty for communal meals.</LD>
<TE>   True North offers three departures a week until Oct. 7. A
three-night version of this trip is also available. Contact True
North Tours; (403) 912-0407, www.truenorthtours.com.</TE>
<TE>   New this year is a three-day trip from Calgary south to Waterton
National Park, which costs $74, or $64 if you purchase it with
another True North tour. Waterton hugs the U.S. border with Glacier
National Park, and together they form the International Peace Park,
which straddles the border. Here where the prairies meet the Rockies
is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, where
the Indians of the North American plains killed bison by chasing them
over a precipice and then carving up the carcasses in a camp below.
It's also grizzly bear country.</TE>
<TE>   Bigfoot Adventure Tours, a Vancouver-based flexible transportation
network for backpackers, students and independent travelers, has
stretched its Island Explorer tour to four days. This trip offers sea
kayaking, hiking in a 1,000-year-old forest, relaxing in natural hot
springs and whale watching. Groups leave from Vancouver and ferry to
Nanaimo for one night, then move to the west coast to spend two
nights in Tofino before heading down for a last night in Victoria.
You can hop off at this point and take the ferry to Seattle, or stick
with the group and return to Vancouver. The transportation and guide
cost $131.</TE>
<TE>   Bigfoot offers backpacker bus services over several routes on the
mainland, linking Whistler, Kamloops, Jasper, Banff, Revelstoke,
Kelowna, Vancouver and Seattle. A three-day trip from Banff to
Vancouver costs $96. Stops are made in Revelstoke and Kelowna, where
there are opportunities to watch wildlife, hike, swim, canoe and go
houseboating. Bigfoot groups include a maximum of 24 passengers.
Contact Bigfoot Adventure Tours Inc.; (888) 244-6673,
www.bigfoottours.com.</TE>
<TE>   Moose Travel Network is Canada's national hop-on, hop-off
backpacker bus service. There are no age limits, but it's geared to
18- to 34-year-olds. Those who have international student, youth and
youth hostel identity cards can get discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Moose's minivan service travels routes in eastern and western
Canada about three times per week until Oct. 15. Stops will be made
at hostels, where you are guaranteed a bed in a coed dorm room and
where you can prepare your own meals.</TE>
<TE>   Moose's eastern Canada route travels from Toronto to Kingston,
Montreal, Tadoussac (where there's good whale-watching), Quebec City,
Mt. Tremblant, Wakefield, Maynooth (for canoeing in Algonquin Park)
and back to Toronto for $268. Moose's western Canada pass links
Vancouver to Whistler, Kamloops, Valemount, Jasper, Banff, Revelstoke
and Kelowna for $262. As with all Moose passes, a student or youth
discount is available. Both passes can be combined into the Canada
Pass, which costs $504, but you'll need to travel between Toronto and
Vancouver yourself. VIA Rail has a special prairie rail link that
lets Moose customers travel between Toronto and Vancouver for $284,
or $272 for students. Stopovers are permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Moose also offers shorter routes in eastern and western Canada,
and rail links for the Maritime provinces and Gaspe Peninsula.
Contact Moose Travel Network; (888) 816-6673 for eastern Canada or
(888) 388-4881 for western Canada, www.moosenetwork.com.</TE>
<TE>   This summer VIA Rail Canada, (888) VIA-RAIL, www.viarail.ca, is
offering students with international student identity cards a 35%
discount on economy-class tickets, and student rates for
Canrailpasses, which are valid for 12 days of unlimited travel within
a 30-day period. Greyhound Canada, (800) 661-TRIP (661-8747),
www.greyhound.ca, is offering students with ISIC cards a 25% discount
on regular fares. Those who have recognized hostel cards (such as VIP
and Nomads) can get a 10% discount.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Wilderness Trips, which is owned by Travel CUTS (part of
the Canadian Federation of Students), operates two- to 10-day canoe
and sea kayak adventures in Ontario that depart from Toronto in
15-passenger vans. Contact (416) 960-2298,

<HD>'Railway to the Clouds' Captured the Imagination of
California</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the decades known as the "Great Hiking Era," from the 1890s to the
1930s, a visionary and avid hiker built a "Railway to the
Clouds"--which for a time became Los Angeles' foremost amusement
ride.</LD>
<LD>   Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine Lowe and a partner conceived the
world's first electric-powered mountain railway, the Mt. Lowe Scenic
Railway above Altadena, which was considered one of the world's
greatest engineering feats of the 19th century. They carved out a
wonderland of hotels, a zoo, an observatory, a grand pavilion, a
searchlight that played on the valley below and trails in the San
Gabriel Mountains. The seven-mile railroad traversed severe mountain
slopes and transported millions of sightseers willing to pay as much
as $5 each round trip. For four decades, it was Southern California's
leading tourist attraction. But fire, flood, an earthquake, a
rockslide, the Great Depression and the decline of rail transit led
to its demise.</LD>
<LD>   The railway idea began in 1888 when Lowe, a gifted scientist and
devoted family man, moved from New Hampshire to Pasadena with
intentions of retiring at age 55. He built a 24,000-square-foot
showplace on Orange Grove Boulevard, where he dreamed and gazed
longingly at the snow-capped peak of Mt. Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   He had served the Union forces as a reconnaissance balloonist for
President Lincoln during the Civil War. Demonstrating the value of
the balloon, he took the first aerial photographs and pioneered
aerial mapping.</TE>
<TE>   Despite only a fourth-grade education, he made a fortune from
inventions and patents dealing with steel, hydrogen gas and
refrigeration. He also helped organize two banks.</TE>
<TE>   But retirement didn't come easily to an inventor who could not
stop inventing. Lowe hooked up with a civil engineer, David Joseph
Macpherson, who had been looking at the same mountain with an eye
toward constructing a railway.</TE>
<TE>   Together they hiked the ridges and canyons and fished the streams.
Inspired by the beauty of this hikers' paradise, where roaring
waterfalls carved the cliffs of Rubio Canyon, both men decided that
other sightseers should experience it. Two Mt. Wilson landowners who
operated a toll road to rugged camping grounds refused to give Lowe
and Macpherson the right-of-way. Undeterred, the pair moved their
ambitions four miles east to Oak Mountain, later renamed Mt. Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the majestic mountains proved more challenging than restful.
In 1891, with Lowe's imagination and money and Macpherson's
engineering skills, they began their project.</TE>
<TE>   A crew of 50 men blasted through rock with dynamite, dangling from
ropes over the cliff face to chip out holes for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   In less than two years, the railway spanned about three miles,
from the Altadena Junction on Lake Avenue to Echo Mountain. In two
more years, it reached the base of Mt. Lowe, nearly four more miles.</TE>
<TE>   The idea soon captured the imagination of Pasadena too: The peak
was officially renamed Mt. Lowe in December 1892.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, 1893, the Mt. Lowe Scenic Railway opened to music
played by the Pasadena City Band, which rode in the first cable car
from Rubio Canyon to Echo Mountain. Eerie echoes reverberated off the
canyon walls as the white railway car disappeared into a low bank of
clouds while the band played "Nearer My God to Thee."</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 white-knuckled passengers held on tight as the car
began its ascent from Altadena Junction, north through the poppy
fields and into Rubio Canyon. There, they disembarked to enjoy the
amenities at the Rubio Hotel and pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Guests danced in the moonlight and ventured up the sunlit canyon
on wooden walkways to marvel at the landscape and waterfalls. Others
boarded two "airships," aptly named Echo and Rubio, on the great
cable incline for a breathtaking 3,000-foot ride up a 62% grade to
the Echo Mountain resort area.</TE>
<TE>   Atop Echo Mountain stood Lowe's "White City," so named because the
white electric lights of the hotel, zoo, power plant, observatory and
the world's largest searchlight could be seen as far away as Catalina
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Guests thrilled to the sound of their voices reverberating around
Echo Mountain, enhanced by a metal megaphone on a stand. Visitors
could enjoy the surrounding scenery on more than 30 miles of hiking
trails.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1895, Lowe completed the final 3 1/2 miles of the
railway to Crystal Springs, a forested cove at the base of Mt. Lowe.
The line followed the natural contours of the mountainside over 18
trestles and 127 hairpin curves, including the Grand Circular Bridge
and Horseshow Curve, to the Ye Alpine Tavern, which was flanked by
cozy private bungalows.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors watched sunsets from Inspiration Point, where a number of
telescope-like sightseeing tubes pointed to spots in the valley
below. Others walked to a nearby farm where silver foxes were bred
for the fur market, or rode horses on the trails.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the railway line's success, it proved a financial drain.
Lowe spent $700,000 on the venture, and two years after its
completion, he had to mortgage all he owned--including his home, the
Pasadena Opera House and several gas companies throughout the
state--in a desperate attempt to remain solvent. Still, he lost
control of his empire and died in obscurity in Pasadena in 1913, at
the age of 81.</TE>
<TE>   After the turn of the century, Henry E. Huntington, builder of the
vast Southern California Pacific Electric railway network, bought the
Mt. Lowe railway and linked it to his trolley line.</TE>
<TE>   The Echo Mountain hotel was already gone, destroyed in 1900 by an
electrical fire caused by a defective stove vent. That was the first
of several disasters to befall the project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1905, a violent windstorm and fire destroyed the trestles and
all the buildings on Echo Mountain except the observatory and
telescope--which would be badly damaged by the wind more than two
decades later.</TE>
<TE>   A flood and rockslide in 1909 destroyed the Rubio Hotel and
pavilion, where caretaker and railroad agent Fred Drew was living
with his family. When a bolt of lightning struck the east wall of the
canyon, it sent a ton of rocks cascading down on the building. Drew
and his wife were seriously injured but were able to save their
5-year-old son, Thayer--only to see him crushed to death as he ran
back to rescue his dog. The boy's body was found clutching its
remains.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel and pavilion were replaced with a car barn.</TE>
<TE>   The railway's demise began in 1936, when a fire gutted 13 cottages
and the Ye Alpine Tavern (by then renamed Mt. Lowe Tavern). Two years
later, heavy rainstorms took out most of the railway tracks.</TE>
<TE>   During its 43 years, the narrow-gauge railway attracted tourists
from around the world and carried 3.1 million passengers without a
single accident. As many as 1,500 people made the trip in a day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the railway site was listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. Mt. Lowe enthusiasts have published books, collected
memorabilia, cleared trails and rebuilt a shelter at Inspiration
Point to ensure that the memories and rich stories associated with
Lowe and his railroad will endure.</TE>

<HD>OCTA Needs a Battle Plan</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CenterLine proponents got a boost late in May when an independent
study suggested that the controversial light rail system would create
more than 29,000 jobs and pump $3.2 billion into the local economy.
Of course, the county would have to spend considerable seed
money--$1.5 billion in capital costs and $625 million for operating
and maintenance costs--to generate that return. But the rosy
prediction prompted Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who doubles as chairman
of the Orange County Transportation Authority, to praise CenterLine
as "not just a transportation project. It is an economic engine."</LD>
<LD>   A final vote on the scaled-back 18-mile line that would run
through Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa won't come for more than a
year. There were solid reasons why the original CenterLine proposal
stalled. Despite the hundreds of informational meetings, extensive
mailings and surveying work, OCTA failed to develop a consensus on
the need for the costly public works project. The challenge will be
to make a more persuasive case this time or abandon the project once
and for all.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents last time scored points because OCTA in effect said
"trust us" instead of sitting down with residents and effectively
countering charges that CenterLine would divide communities, generate
pollution, create safety hazards and, in the end, do little to
relieve jammed highways. All along, there have been questions about
how the project would pencil out. If the long, costly and frustrating
battle over the closed El Toro Marine base proved anything, it was
that really big ideas must be thoroughly debated before a take-
it-or-leave-it proposal is handed to the people.</TE>
<TE>   The economic report from Cal State Fullerton effectively marks
CenterLine's return to the political spotlight. The rail line was
mothballed early last year after it became apparent that OCTA lacked
support for a controversial proposal to build a longer (35 miles) and
more expensive ($2.3 billion) line that would have extended through
Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Now, even CenterLine supporters recognize that the light rail
system must be sold more on what it will mean for individual
residents than on macro economic factors.</TE>
<TE>   If CenterLine makes economic sense, the rail system could be an
important element in a public transportation battle plan that also
must include buses, vans and continued improvements to the county's
freeways. But that's a big "if."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, those who would rather have OCTA limit its
projects to highway improvements must recognize that the agency's
charge is to get people, not just automobiles, moving. OCTA,
meanwhile, must continue taking steps to ensure that public
transportation across the board is improved.</TE>
<TE>   Rail lines draw heat because they're inherently expensive. Last
year, OCTA sent scouts to determine how Denver and Dallas secured
public support for rail lines. OCTA might also consider visiting
Pasadena, where the 14-mile Gold Line that runs to downtown Los
Angeles is scheduled to begin service in July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA must tell residents how the "CenterLine Lite" project will
improve the transportation picture. The agency should start by
explaining why residents should support a scaled-down version. A year
ago, OCTA argued that the 35-mile line made sense because it would
run through cities that house more than half of the county's work
force and a third of its population. Opponents surely are going to
question the shorter line's economics, so OCTA had best have the
answers ready this time.</TE>

<LD>The Pacific rolls majestically onto Orange County shores, marking the
passage of time in a sunny place. It reminds residents who catch a
passing glimpse in any season of its power and place in their lives.
The approach of the summer season brings even closer encounters, as
thousands flock to the beach to test the waters and get relief from
the heat.</LD>
<LD>   But lurking behind the beauty are summer safety hazards related to
the hidden power of the sea. Big swells generated by distant oceanic
conditions hit the beaches and create tides that can carry swimmers
out to alarming distances. Rip currents create strong flows of water
potentially causing swimmers to panic if they lack the expertise to
swim out of them safely. These currents also can propel swimmers into
the hazards awaiting on rocks, piers, pilings and jetties.</LD>
<LD>   For many, the lifeguard is the traditional first line of warning
and protection against this array of waterfront dangers--to give
advice on water conditions, to deliver first aid and to carry out the
traditional role of performing rescues. But having lifeguards costs
money, and there is mixed news this season. While local beaches seem
adequately covered, state beaches are not as well staffed.</LD>
<TE>   Six state beaches in Orange County will have fewer lifeguards this
summer because of the state deficit, literally a sign that it is
harder to hit the beach running when dollars become scarcer. City
beaches are better off, and San Clemente has even had the wherewithal
to hire some extra lifeguards from a strong group of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But even on Orange County beaches where full staffing is possible,
safety should not be taken for granted. That's especially so in
locations that may be short on personnel. Protection from powerful
currents and hazardous shoreline conditions often is a matter of an
individual's willingness to learn about local conditions and to make
intelligent choices on where to swim. A lot can happen on busy days,
or in waters just beyond protected areas.</TE>
<TE>   A day at the beach is supposed to be fun, but without proper
education on local conditions and taking due precaution, it can be
dangerous. Whether there are fewer lifeguards, as is the case at
state beaches, or an adequate number at city sites, water safety
really is everyone's concern. Beachgoers shouldn't rely only on the
lifeguard stand to deliver them from waterfront troubles. Instead,
they should exercise common sense to avoid many surf-related
problems.</TE>

<LD>Irvine has approved plans to plant 12,350 houses near the former El
Toro military base, gradually swelling the city's population by a
third. Energy companies that own land straddling the border between
Orange and Los Angeles counties near Brea want to build more than
3,500 homes on land that's now home to mountain lions, bobcats and
coyotes.</LD>
<LD>   Huge developments are part and parcel of Orange County, but the
latest generation of housing developments is sure to stoke Orange
County's love-hate relationship with suburban sprawl. The UC Irvine
Annual Survey will be released in the fall, and it's a solid bet that
growth and development, high housing costs and traffic congestion
will again top the list of local concerns. With more of the county
built out, planners must rise to the challenge of fitting new
development into the remaining buildable land.</LD>
<LD>   Those who've already got their castle and want to pull up the
drawbridge will be lobbying city and county planners to just say no
to further development. Those arguments don't hold water, though,
because housing is in short supply. The two projects represent
significant pieces of the county's remaining land-use jigsaw puzzle.
The so-called Northern Sphere near the former base would largely
complete the process of building Irvine; the developments proposed in
and around Brea would fill in empty space separating Orange and Los
Angeles counties.</LD>
<TE>   The proposals must be tackled on a regional basis. Planners in
Diamond Bar already have sent a letter to Orange County planners to
remind them that what happens to the unincorporated tract near Brea
will have a ripple effect on residents in Los Angeles, San Bernardino
and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the additional traffic on highways and the added
demand for public services. Developers and planners also must be
mindful of the 31-mile wildlife corridor stretching from the
Cleveland National Forest to the Whittier Narrows region. They also
must provide services for future residents who will need parks and
open space in an area where undeveloped land will only grow more
scarce. A plan floated by Nuevo Energy Co., which wants to build 914
homes on land near Brea, has shocked environmentalists. The company,
which boasts that it has developed a "conservation-minded plan,"
proposed open space including nearly 300 oil wells that will continue
to pump for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, developers and planners must find creative ways to ensure
that new developments address the crucial issue of affordable
housing. The county should take its lead from Fannie Mae, which has
earmarked $2 trillion nationwide to make housing more accessible for
immigrants and other underserved households where home ownership has
been difficult to achieve. Local planners owe it to future
generations to keep the dream of home ownership alive.</TE>

<HD>Bren's Irvine Land Gift: Too Little Too Late?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Orange County Billionaire With Space to Spare," John Balzar
column, May 29:</LD>
<LD>   Donald Bren has made a billion dollars by creating urban sprawl.
Now Bren is going to pave over the last pristine rural area of the
Santa Ana Mountains to make way for 2,000 homes--in the same area
that you say he is preserving.</LD>
<LD>   What he did was give away land he could not make a buck on, put
out some slick brochures and use the Nature Conservancy as a cover.
Can't this fellow be happy with the billion he already has?</LD>

<TE>   John Balzar waxes eloquent on behalf of Donald Bren, Orange
County's biggest, richest developer. During the 30 years I have been
a resident of Irvine, liberals have reviled Bren. Why? He is
"greedy," "rich" and, worst of all by far, a "conservative." Better
yet, a "right-winger." When it comes time to take massive gifts of
land from Bren, leftists thank him profusely. When Bren donates
hundreds of thousands of dollars to our schools, the liberals are all
smiles.</TE>
<TE>   The next time Bren wants to build homes or commercial buildings,
the liberals will once again revert to their vile epithets and
NIMBYism.</TE>
<TE>   John Jaeger</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's not go overboard with praise for Donald Bren's gift of open
space. It is very nice of him to give land that probably less than 2%
of the population will ever use or see.</TE>
<TE>   Bren believes that "legroom means different things to different
people." To me that means not destroying the hills of Newport Coast,
the blight of all blights on the landscape. Miles and miles of pink
stucco and tile roofs are not my idea of paradise.</TE>
<TE>   The absolute shame of all time is the development of the land from
Corona del Mar to northern Laguna Beach. What was wrong with that
pristine view of hills and ocean? It was the single stretch of Coast
Highway where one's eyes could just rest and not be assaulted by the
commercialization of our coastline.</TE>
<TE>   John Balzar can be as thrilled as he wants to be and kiss Bren's
feet. But for me, it is much too little, much too late.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Fourth Teacher Sickout at Capistrano Unified," May 31:</LD>
<LD>   The callous and cynical disregard of the Capistrano Unified School
District's superintendent and Board of Trustees for teachers is
resonant in the words of their spokesman, David Smollar. Seeking fair
remuneration is no "game," and picketing and demonstrating are not
"fun." The district's delay in passing through money already paid to
it by the state has made us angry. We teachers have asked for very
little--a 2.5% raise--but the administration has given us nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. James A. Fleming, in a letter sent to parents of our
students, labels us "greedy." But he avidly accepts a salary of
$185,000--only $10,000 less than that of the mayor of New York--plus
thousands more in annual housing and vehicle allowances. While
Fleming asserts there is no money for teachers, he cashes the checks
from the state and plans new district offices. Meanwhile, the
teachers, who have propelled this district to the top in student
performance in California, work for salaries that are below the
median in Orange County. Teaching is my calling, my career and my
livelihood. I am good at it and I deserve to be well-paid for it.</LD>
<TE>   Linda Yeargin</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recently, many schools in the Capistrano Unified district were
plagued with a barrage of sickouts by teachers protesting an unfair
district decision not to increase teacher salaries in proportion to
inflation. The major problem I have with the district's decision is
that the teachers are simply requesting a pay increase that would
mirror the inflation that is affecting our whole economy.</TE>
<TE>   These teachers have not chosen their profession for the money, and
shouldn't be seen as selfish. They do a difficult and sometimes
unrewarding job, and they should be paid appropriately. They have
helped us students numerous times, so I am urging all of you to
support them in their struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Chigozie Amadi</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Dana Hills High School staged a strike, or--cough--a
sick day. In support of these teachers, some students did not come to
school. Many people might say that, of course, the students would
take this opportunity for a ditch day, and not take this sign of
support seriously. But many of these students actually were trying to
make a point.</TE>
<TE>   With only two weeks until finals, each class period becomes more
important, and it hurts students when they do not come to class.
Also, many of the students that did not come to school were the honor
students, who supposedly care more than anyone else about their
grades.</TE>
<TE>   Some students really do care about their teachers and the way they
are being treated, or, in this case, mistreated. Every student has
had at least one good teacher who made some sort of an impact, as
well as more than one extremely hard-working teacher.</TE>
<TE>   The last people who should be treated with lack of appreciation
are teachers. For these reasons, students at Dana Hills also decided
to strike.</TE>

<LD>Re "Church Not Solely to Blame in Scandal," Commentary, May 12:</LD>
<LD>   I have neither heard nor read anywhere that the Roman Catholic
priests, bishops and cardinals are the only ones to blame in this
tragedy. As you point out, parents have a responsibility to be
vigilant with regard to their children. But I find it repugnant that
a "rush to stereotype Catholics" is offered as an explanation for
attacks on the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   Any large organization draws additional scrutiny. Furthermore,
believers united under the mantle of moral leadership demand that the
very notion that church leaders might be preying upon their most
vulnerable members should be swiftly and openly investigated.</LD>
<TE>   The decisions to simply counsel and relocate priests was no more a
solution than rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.</TE>

<HD>Church Fights Cypress: Good Versus Evil?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Faith Goes Undiminished in Quest for a New Church," June 3:</LD>
<LD>   I have been fascinated by the situation in Cypress. The Cottonwood
Christian Church wants to build a huge cathedral for thousands of
worshippers, and the city desires a revenue-producing retail center.
All I keep hearing from the pro-Cottonwood people is how this nation
was founded on religious freedom, and that it is God's will for this
cathedral to be built, even if most Cypress residents don't want it.
The supporters continually tell me it's anti-Christian to be against
the church.</LD>
<LD>   What I wonder is if these Christians would feel the same way if it
were going to be the Cottonwood Islamic Center and bring thousands of
Muslims from all over Southern California to Cypress. Somehow I doubt
their devotion to religious freedom would be as strong.</LD>
<TE>   Darlene Lee</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The biggest tragedy in the debate is that Cypress has prevented
Cottonwood Christian Center from obtaining fair-market value for its
land. Perhaps the city did advise the church it would not rezone the
land for a religious facility, and perhaps church leaders did not
listen. But offering $14.6 million for land that is surely worth more
is grand larceny.</TE>
<TE>   If this land is so valuable, as the City Council says, why is the
city offering only $18.62 per square foot? The going rate for
less-desirable vacant land in Cypress is $23 to $25 per square foot.
Why would Costco or anyone else negotiate in good faith to buy the
land if they know that the city will seize it for far less than
market value?</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Chia</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Christian pastor, I understand the frustration that the
congregation of Cottonwood Christian Center feels toward Cypress. But
their frustration should at least in part be directed toward their
church leadership. It is obvious that Cottonwood Christian Center did
not do its homework. Cities have the right to develop themselves as
they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   If they were trying to tear down a church, that would be a
different story, and I would defend that church's right to continue
to stand. It is wrong to demonize the Cypress City Council, because
this is not a good-versus-evil fight.</TE>
<TE>   This just may be poor judgment on the part of church leaders who
acted hastily.</TE>

<TE>   La Mirada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am aghast. Who gave Cottonwood the right to declare that this
battle over a piece of parking lot is a matter of "good versus evil"?
Satan has taken the form of the Cypress City Council? I thought this
was a Christian church, but the words and actions of the church
haven't been in keeping with the Christian faith. Neither has their
smear campaign, their knocking on doors and preaching to the public
and the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress residents are tired of being harassed and bad-mouthed by
this mega-church that is trying to bully its way into Cypress. This
issue really is black and white. The city, in order to keep services
the way they are--and the way citizens expect them to be--needs tax
revenue. To get that tax revenue, one of two things needs to happen:
Cottonwood agrees to pay taxes, or a big-box retailer is built.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna Jung</TE>
<TE>   Cypress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am not a Cypress resident or a member of the Cottonwood
Christian Center, but I am a U.S. citizen who cherishes all that our
country stands for. On that basis I find the behavior of the Cypress
City Council reprehensible. We ought to be models of good government
for the young people who will one day be leaders. I suggest that the
city leaders take time out to consider their decisions. Their image
would improve if they did what was correct rather than what is deemed
expedient.</TE>
<TE>   Costco, meanwhile, is guilty by its silence. Let's show some
courage.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Miller</TE>
<TE>   Downey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cypress City Council justifies its decision to seize land from
the Cottonwood Christian Center by saying "the city depends on
sales-tax revenue." That isn't much different from a bank robber who
pleads innocent because he needed the money.</TE>
<TE>   We who value liberty will speak by refusing to do business in
Cypress and with Costco. I do hope Costco realizes why I did not
renew my membership last month.</TE>

<LD>Re "Solomona Should Get Maximum Sentence," Letters, June 2:</LD>
<LD>   Bill Hoffine is right about a societal message being sent, but
wrong about the needed message. The right message is clear: If you

You can't always count on law-abiding citizens to control their
anger.</LD>

altercation. A 17-year-old is not a harmless prankster, and the
presence of two young men can be life-threatening.</LD>
<TE>   These young adults were out looking for trouble, evidenced by the
fact that another person previously had chased them in his car after
they threw something at him. These young men "sowed the wind and
reaped the whirlwind" for their cruel actions.</TE>

<HD>CenterLine Boon or Bust for Orange County?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "CenterLine Would Be a Track Star, Study Says," May 31:</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the CenterLine light-rail plan in Irvine are missing
the point. Light rail attracts business and housing development
because it is inflexible. Investors know that a rail station
operating today will be there 50 years from now. No one will build
more than a newspaper vending machine at a bus stop because the bus
route might disappear next month.</LD>
<LD>   Those who argue that monorails are cheaper should investigate the
system a private consortium is building in Las Vegas. It will have
passenger capacity comparable to CenterLine's but is budgeted at $150
million per mile, versus $85 million per mile for CenterLine. A
cheaper system is possible, but by that reasoning, the cheapest thing
to do is nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County can no longer afford to do nothing about rail mass
transit. Opponents have a chance of winning at the ballot box if the
vote is held before the Gold Line from Pasadena to downtown Los
Angeles is up and running. That rail line will make it obvious that
well-designed light rail can be a great success.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Schumacher</TE>
<TE>   Dallas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Transportation Authority first tried to sell
CenterLine as a solution to "traffic congestion." When its
environmental impact study failed to support the plan, OCTA changed
the focus to "improving mobility."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA avoids defining mobility in its public relations efforts
because CenterLine will make mobility worse for bus riders. It will
lengthen their travel time because existing bus routes will be
replaced with feeder buses that will force riders to transfer to the
CenterLine. Passengers will then have to transfer to another feeder
bus to reach their destination.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton, a vocal CenterLine supporter, has generated
an economic forecast study for CenterLine. The same kinds of studies
were generated by airport supporters who wanted to convert the El
Toro Marine base into an international airport.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, OCTA Chairman Todd Spitzer, who fought to protect
Irvine from planes at El Toro, is now leading efforts to build a rail
line through Irvine neighborhoods. He wants Irvine residents to
believe that a train outside their bedroom windows would be good for
them. Neither planes nor trains are good neighbors.</TE>

<TE>   Every day there are declarations for or against toll roads,
trains, airports and freeways. We now have a wonderful opportunity to
create a transportation infrastructure that will serve our present
and future needs. The old models of transportation are obsolete.
Science has learned how to neutralize gravity, construct underwater
pressure tunnels, create high-speed monorail systems and computerize
trucks and cars so they can safely reach their destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Effective transportation systems are vital for economic and human
growth. We live in a world of unlimited potentialities, yet we keep
building obsolete methods of transporting people and goods. Now is
the time to draft transportation systems that are safe, effective and
can change to meet future needs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Our Air-Traffic Woes Aren't Going Anywhere," Letters, June 2:</LD>
<LD>   After 10 years of planning for an airport at El Toro and wasting
more than $50 million in taxpayer money, and just three months after
a majority of Orange County voters junked the El Toro Airport plan
through Measure W, some people still don't get it.</LD>
<LD>   Sore losers like William Kearns, who still believe that another
airport is needed in Orange County, should explain why John Wayne
Airport is operating at only half its capacity. If he and his Newport
Beach cohorts really want jumbo jets flying in and out of the county
around the clock, they can organize and start collecting signatures
to expand John Wayne Airport. It's already there and it's underused.</LD>
<TE>   Kearns can call me. I'll volunteer to help collect signatures as I
did with Measure F and Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Castelo</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   William Kearns' letter states that the El Toro base has "operable
runways ... that already have been paid for by taxpayers." Previous
misleading oratory by Kearns and other pro-airport folks was what
turned me against the airport. The flat-out mistruths, half-truths
and innuendo were misleading to the point of lying. And I'm a pilot
and aircraft owner who loves aviation.</TE>
<TE>   The runways at El Toro are not operable for a commercial airport,
and Kearns knows it. The east-west runways have a slope that is the
equivalent of an eight-story building. Planners stated the runways
would be raised at one end and lowered at the other, meaning a
complete rebuild at massive expense. That isn't "operable."</TE>
<TE>   The north-south runways are too close together for instrument
operation, so one of them would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the
stated 18-million passenger capacity. The taxiways and tarmac setback
areas don't comply with current design and anti-terrorism
requirements, so they would need to be demolished and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   I predict that should an airport ever be built there, barely one
chunk of existing concrete will remain. The freeway and roadway
infrastructure that would be built to accommodate the surface traffic
would be huge, and the net result would be a totally new facility at
great expense.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Wrong Route to an Airport," Editorial, June 2:</TE>
<TE>   The Times' editorial was as indirect and confused as William
Kearns' companion letter on the same subject was clear and direct.
Both essays identified Orange County's failure to accept its regional
airport responsibilities. But neither recommended the necessary
action that must be taken--the creation of a true Southern California
Regional Airport Authority. The SCRAA must be a state agency, not a
voluntary association of cities and counties, like the current SCRAA,
or the larger Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns correctly called for El Toro's reactivation, but it's
probably up to the governor and state legislature to save El Toro,
either through legislative action or a regional ballot initiative.
The entire region should be empowered to vote on regional airport
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of El Toro's fate, an umbrella agency is needed to
ensure that all of Southern California's counties adequately provide
for air transportation in an environmentally sensitive and
politically transparent manner. The state should act now, and it
wouldn't hurt a bit if The Times said so too.</TE>

<LD>Re "Paradise Found in a Trailer Park," May 20:</LD>
<LD>   The recent article on disappearing coastal trailer parks could
leave the casual reader with the wrong impression about the future of
the El Morro trailer park at Crystal Cove State Park. Lumping the
former Treasure Island and other privately owned trailer parks
together with El Morro implies that they share the same fate. Nothing
could be further from the truth.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that El Moro Canyon will be returning to public
use after Jan. 1, 2005, for anyone who can afford a tent and some
firewood. The park was acquired by the state in 1978, so while other
trailer parks are being replaced by hotels for the wealthier, this
little slice of paradise has been set aside for all of us, forever.</LD>

<LD>Re "Tailor Teaching to the Child," Editorial, May 26:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial caught an often-omitted detail in terms of
children's learning deficits--the teachers who refer children for
batteries of tests. The insinuation is that classroom teachers are
not qualified to make these decisions.</LD>
<LD>   I hope Mel Levine's program will sharpen teachers' abilities to
discern and analyze these learning deficits. Perhaps Levine's
training will lend credibility to the classroom teacher. The next
step would be to increase the number of school psychologists. I wish
there were a matching $7 million for schools to carry out these
ideas.</LD>

<LD>Re "Will Teachers Learn to Quit Bellyaching?" June 2:</LD>
<LD>   I am incensed that Kelly Oberlin and others expect public school
teachers to donate hundreds of hours of their time each year simply
because they "chose the teaching profession."</LD>
<LD>   I think she should ask all of her "teacher friends in Santa Ana"
to apply for teaching jobs in south Orange County where they will
"enjoy" inflated costs of everything. A teachers without a working
partner can forget about buying a home. Dana Point, for example, just
agreed to pay its city manager $125,000 a year, a $600 monthly travel
expense and give him $250,000 to help buy a home.</LD>
<TE>   Our children are not valued that much and no such deal will ever
be made for a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   As to "hurting our kids," I invite Oberlin to volunteer her time
for makeup tests, tutoring, club advising and then write to tell us
about the extra hours that she gladly took away--without pay--from
her family.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Rouse</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In her letter, Kelly Oberlin accuses teachers of "shirking their
responsibilities and shortchanging our kids." One of the biggest
challenges teachers face is the public's ignorance about teaching.
Test scores aren't high enough. Kids are dropping out. California
kids score among the lowest in the country. Teachers are failing
their students.</TE>
<TE>   Why are teachers blamed when they have so little control over
their environment? I teach in a wonderful district, yet my job
becomes more difficult every year.</TE>
<TE>   There is no money for new computers, yet we are expected to teach
the technology standards. Classrooms are not air-conditioned, so we
teach when the room temperature hits 90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   We teach from textbooks chosen for us that are written by people
who have never been in a classroom. We are told there isn't enough
money to buy workbooks for every child so we are given one to
copy--but there isn't enough money for paper. When teachers run out
of copies for the month, many pay for their own copies. Most teachers
spend at least $1,000 of their own money for classroom supplies each
year.</TE>
<TE>   We have no control over any of these things, yet we go on
teaching. There aren't many professions in which you are required to
complete five or more years of college, yet remain at the mercy of
people who have little or no experience in your field. And you have
to rely upon a union to fight for everything you need to do your job.</TE>
<TE>   I challenge Oberlin or anyone else who thinks teachers are
"bellyaching" to visit a classroom.</TE>

<HD>Lake Arrowhead Is Driest Ever Going Into Summer</HD>
<DH>Resources: Four years of drought have taken a toll, and
rising water use has made matters worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Wagner edges his boat around Lake Arrowhead's shallow rim and
grimaces. In this privately owned playground of wealthy lowlanders
and retirees, hundreds of boat docks are high and dry in the muck.</LD>
<LD>   On the north shore's exclusive coves, the lushly landscaped
mansions sit far from the water's edge, their forlorn piers ringed by
sprouting marsh grass. Some homeowners on one shallow bay have moved
their docks closer to the water so many times they've come close to
touching noses with their neighbors on the other side.</LD>
<LD>   Lake Arrowhead has never been drier heading into the summer
season. And the worst is yet to come: Now nearly 13 feet below
normal, the lake is expected to lose at least six more vertical feet
by September's end.</LD>
<TE>   The dry spell has spurred an unprecedented conservation plan that
soon could force fines on water scofflaws. It has prompted the public
water and sewer agency that serves Arrowhead Woods to search for a
secondary water source to supplement the San Bernardino Mountains
lake. And, it is bringing trouble to a paradise defined by
entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the worst it's been since the lake filled in 1922," said
Wagner, a civil engineer who helped form the homeowners' Arrowhead
Lake Assn. nearly a quarter of a century ago and serves on its board.
"It's too important to ignore."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike surrounding San Bernardino Mountains communities, which
rely on wells drilled deep into the cracked mountain granite and
supplement their supply with state water, Arrowhead Woods' 7,600
homes and businesses rely on lake water alone for drinking and other
uses. And no one else has a legal right to touch it.</TE>
<TE>   Residents call it a blessing and a right. Now it also has become a
burden.</TE>
<TE>   Arrowhead Woods was developed in the 1920s and burgeoned in later
years under the ownership of wood and paper conglomerate Boise
Cascade. Cary Grant learned to water ski on these waters. Liberace
owned a home here, lining his boat dock with decorative piano keys.
And a steady stream of celebrities and retired executives have sought
refuge in gated lakefront enclaves. More modest cabins, built in
earlier years, also dot the shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning, only Arrowhead Woods homeowners have had
access to the reservoir, and today they must join the Arrowhead Lake
Assn. to go boating. Weekend tourists can take a guided jaunt around
the lake, but are not permitted to venture out on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Four years of drought have taken a toll, and increased water
consumption has made matters worse. Since 1975, annual water use has
tripled, outpacing population growth sixfold, said Gary Valladao,
general manager of the Lake Arrowhead Community Services District.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County planning officials say they are processing
more proposed development projects for Lake Arrowhead than
ever--complete with lush lawns and landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "People come up here to escape and not think about mundane things
like water," said Wagner, who doubts that the conservation measures
will hold.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Perrin's business, Kiwi Docks, is moving about eight docks a
day as the water level falls, he said. About 500 of the lake's 2,500
docks are already mud-bound, and that number is sure to rise. Many
docks can't be moved any farther, setting off a scramble to find boat
slips for lease at prices that, in some cases, have nearly doubled to
as much as $4,500 for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Though some residents are happy to offer a slice of shoreline for
another dock, Perrin has encountered hostile homeowners who believe
they own the beach rights and have threatened litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Wallace, a Newport Beach engineer whose family has kept a
house on the lake since the 1920s, is among the lucky ones: He has a
friend with an extra dock slip. Others, like retired construction
magnate Eugene Yeager and his wife, Billie, have allowed neighbors to
side-tie their boats onto their dock, one of the few that remains
usable in upscale Rainbow Point.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news hasn't even sunk in yet with many Arrowhead Woods
residents, more than half of whom live here part time. The yacht club
opened its doors just this weekend, and many residents will arrive in
coming weeks--just in time to find their $350 annual dock bill from
the Arrowhead Lake Assn. in the mail and their dock in the mud.
"That's when the hollering will start," Wagner said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the lake--still nearly 170 feet deep in places and at
least 85% full--is far from empty. Real estate is booming, with sales
of lakefront homes running at a record pace, said Bruce Block,
Coldwell Banker's managing broker. And Tom Houske, who runs the water
ski school his father-in-law founded in the 1940s, expects his
business to pick up because so many residents won't have their own
boats in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Arrowhead Village, a hamlet of outlet stores, restaurants and
lodging, has fared better so far this year than last, said Kirk
Coult, vice president of Irvine-based GC Properties, which took over
management of the village on behalf of new owners in February. His
company has already signed leases with 10 new businesses, including
an upscale restaurant, a pharmacy and a dance studio.</TE>
<TE>   But if consumption habits don't change, the problem will only
worsen with the next drought, said Bob Bernier, water operations
supervisor for the Community Services District.</TE>
<TE>   The district's board in late April declared the community's first
Stage 2 drought alert, limiting outdoor watering to three days a
week, restricting car washing and other activities and laying the
groundwork for a system of fines if residents fail to comply. Surveys
will help pinpoint the community's biggest water hogs and tailor
conservation measures toward them, Bernier said.</TE>
<TE>   "We see some very large bills for people who don't live up here
full time," Valladao said. "There certainly are people who want it
all. They want the lawn, they want the landscaping and they'd like to
have access to the lake."</TE>
<TE>   But even aggressive conservation is unlikely to get at the root of
expanding water use: the wave of development around the lake.
Arrowhead Woods has 7,600 water connections now, with 10,000 allowed.
Whether the water supply can sustain that kind of growth, Valladao
said, is "the big question."</TE>
<TE>   Water officials are hoping the current crisis will finally get
residents interested in finding other water sources--whether from
local wells, the State Water Project's Lake Silverwood or by
augmenting the lake's supply with treated wastewater.</TE>
<TE>   "Toilet to tap" water, though clean and safe, is politically
distasteful. Other solutions have a large price tag: $20 million or
more, enough to turn off local voters. And those who don't live on
the lake or own a boat are not likely to be willing to pay for lake
improvements, although all of Arrowhead Woods would pay the cost. But
if measures aren't taken now, the window could close on the chance to
solve the problem, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to lose the opportunity, now that the community is
interested," Valladao said. "At first there was some thought that,
'Oh, it's going to rain eventually, so why worry?'</TE>
<TE>   "As we started our analysis, we really began believing that
there's a significant problem. We're committed to developing a
long-term solution to try to stabilize the lake level."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Ride Is Smaller But Still Joyous</HD>
<DH>Volunteers: The annual fund-raiser ends with cheers in
Santa Monica. The event also caps a painful chapter sparked by
financial questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California AIDS Ride concluded its seven-day, 575-mile trek
Saturday in Santa Monica, ending a tumultuous year for an event that
has become the granddaddy of cycling treks in support of AIDS
research.</LD>
<LD>   After a 12-month period that has seen the loss of a major
corporate sponsor, the withdrawal of the two major beneficiaries and
the launch of a competing ride, the ninth annual AIDS Ride was
subdued in comparison with past events.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, more than 2,000 cyclists attended closing ceremonies at
the Los Angeles Coliseum. On Saturday, friends and families cheered
715 riders from the bleachers of Santa Monica City College's Corsair
Field.</LD>
<TE>   For those who rode, many for the first time, the buzz that came
from pushing themselves to the limit for seven days straight was not
easy to kill. Before the closing ceremonies, they added silk leis,
Mardi Gras beads, feathered hats and even angel wings to their
long-sleeved red shirts and bicycling shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen years ago, I never thought that I'd make it to age 41,"
said Scott Deshong of Los Angeles, who said he was riding in honor of
15 friends who had died of AIDS. "But here I am."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gary, 43, of Danville, said the ride was an opportunity to
meet new friends, many of whom signed his shirt in black ink. "I
wanted to challenge myself," he said. "And I wanted to ride for the
cause, to raise money for AIDS research."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the question of how much of the money raised by riders--each
of whom must contribute or solicit $2,700 in donations--actually goes
to research and AIDS charities has been the source of ongoing
controversy for Pallotta TeamWorks, the California AIDS Ride's
producer. The for-profit organization, which describes itself as
"sort of a fund-raising company, sort of an event productions
company," organizes 24 events in the U.S., Canada, Africa and Europe,
supporting such causes as breast cancer, suicide prevention and
support for foster children.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a group of Florida AIDS charities dropped Pallotta
TeamWorks after only 11.83% of money raised went to charity. Sponsors
of the Washington, D.C., AIDS Ride have said they will sever ties
with Pallotta TeamWorks after this year's ride, which will begin June
13. And a class-action suit has been filed by participants in four
AIDS Vaccine rides, who say that only $8 million of the $28 million
raised during those events went to charity.</TE>
<TE>   In California, such criticism has meant the splintering of the
AIDS ride into two competing events. In October, the two charities
that have benefited from the California AIDS Ride--the Los Angeles
Gay and Lesbian Center and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation--broke
ties with Pallotta TeamWorks, saying unexpected cost overruns had cut
into proceeds from the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, the groups announced that they would hold a
competing ride in May 2002, two weeks before the California AIDS
Ride.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta TeamWorks unsuccessfully sued to block the new AIDS/Life
Cycle Ride, which drew 670 riders and raised $4.4 million. Last week,
the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation
and Pallotta TeamWorks issued a joint statement that they had
resolved "all of their outstanding differences pertaining to the
California AIDS Ride. The Center and the Foundation wish to
acknowledge Pallotta TeamWorks' pioneering efforts in helping to
raise millions of dollars in the fight against AIDS/HIV."</TE>
<TE>   Both the California AIDS Ride and AIDS/Life Cycle Ride will return
next June. Organizers of the California AIDS Ride said 18 charities
across the state, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, will share an
estimated $2.7 million raised from this year's event.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, rider Diane McClain, who has worked on and off for
AIDS Project Los Angeles since 1989, tied congratulatory balloons, a
gift from her partner, to her bicycle helmet before entering Corsair
Field.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the ride had gone, she shook her head. "It was rough,"
said the 41-year-old. "I got sick and didn't do yesterday. But I got
through it, bad knees and all."</TE>

<HD>Herman Cohen, 76; Film Producer Made Horror Movies Targeted
at Teens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Herman Cohen, a Hollywood producer and writer who launched the
terrorized-teenager subgenre of horror movies in 1957 with the cult
classic "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," starring an unknown actor named
Michael Landon, has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, who had throat cancer, died June 2 at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "In the '50s, he was one of the kings of the drive-in horror
movies, and his pictures helped put [American International Pictures]
on the map," said film historian Tom Weaver, who interviewed Cohen
several times.</LD>
<TE>   Among the best-known of the seven films Cohen produced for AIP, in
addition to "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," are "I Was a Teenage
Frankenstein," "Horrors of the Black Museum" and "How to Make a
Monster."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen also produced a number of thrillers in England in the '60s,
including "A Study in Terror," "Berserk," starring Joan Crawford, and
"Trog," a box-office bomb notable for being Crawford's last picture.</TE>
<TE>   A onetime teenage movie theater usher and assistant manager in
Detroit, Cohen had progressed from producing low-budget independent
films in the early '50s to more mainstream fare--including "Crime of
Passion," starring Barbara Stanwyck--before finding his niche in
teenage horror.</TE>
<TE>   The switch came after an old friend, James H. Nicholson of the
fledgling AIP, invited Cohen to produce a picture for the studio.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, according to Weaver, Cohen had been analyzing changes
in the film industry and discovered that nearly 72% of the audience
was between the ages of 12 and 26.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen knew horror pictures were popular with young audiences, but
felt that having a cast of teenage characters, including teenage
monsters, would greatly boost box office potential.</TE>
<TE>   The lead character in "I Was a Teenage Werewolf" is a likable yet
troubled teenager who undergoes hypnotherapy to cure him of his bad
temper, only to have the evil doctor give him an experimental serum
that transforms him into a bloodthirsty werewolf.</TE>
<TE>   Landon made his film debut cast as the werewolf. The "Werewolf"
script was co-written by Cohen and Aben Kandel, who are listed in the
credits under the pseudonym Ralph Thornton.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen even planned to give the producing credit to "Ralph
Thornton" after friends in the industry warned him he'd be ruined if
he had his name attached to a film called "I Was a Teenage Werewolf."</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen changed his mind about not taking the producer credit
after Bob Hope, Jack Benny and other comedians heard of the movie's
title before the film was released and began making fun of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We started getting calls from Time magazine and Look magazine,
and they wanted to talk to the producer of 'I Was a Teenage
Werewolf,' " Cohen told Weaver in a 1991 interview for Fangoria
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "My secretary said, 'Herman, what do I tell them?'</TE>
<TE>   "Well, when Time and Look and Life started calling for the
producer, I decided that the producer was going to be Herman Cohen."</TE>
<TE>   Made for less than $100,000, "I Was a Teenage Werewolf" became a
surprise hit that earned more than $2 million at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Six of Cohen's post-"Werewolf" movies featured a teenager who is
manipulated by or transformed into a monster by an evil adult.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always felt that most teenagers think that adults--their
parents, or their teachers, anyone who was older and who had
authority--were culprits in their lives," Cohen said in the 1991
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I felt that way when I was a teenager, and in talking to
many teenagers, I found out that that was how they felt," Cohen said.
"And so, in doing pictures primarily for the teenage audiences, I
thought that this theme would strike them just right."</TE>
<TE>   Like Alfred Hitchcock, Cohen frequently made uncredited cameos in
his pictures--he's the man with the crime scene photos in "I Was a
Teenage Werewolf."</TE>
<TE>   And as co-writer of many of his films, he often named characters
after relatives and friends. Brash and funny with a big,
radio-broadcaster voice, Cohen took out his dislike of having to pay
high taxes by naming the vicious mad scientist in "Konga" Decker,
after his accountant.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit-born Cohen began his motion picture career at age 12,
when he started helping out the janitor at a local movie house after
school in exchange for free passes for himself and his family.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, he was working as an usher, and by 18 he was managing the
theater. He went on to become assistant manager of the Fox Theater in
Detroit, a 5,200-seat movie palace that he bought in 1981 and owned
for 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   After wartime service in the Army, Cohen worked as sales manager
for the Detroit branch of Columbia Pictures and, after moving to
Hollywood, he joined the publicity department of Columbia Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his first screen credit in 1951, as assistant producer
of "Bride of the Gorilla," and a year later served as associate
producer of "Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen stopped producing movies in the '70s and formed Cobra Media,
a domestic distribution firm, in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a brother, Aaron Cohen of Las Vegas, and a
sister, Dorothy Droz Mills of Southfield, Mich.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Make Gains Against 2 Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Hazards: Residents go home as Saugus blaze slackens. Los
Padres fire 40% contained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS and HOLLY WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firefighters battled a 21,000-acre wildfire amid rising winds near
Ojai on Saturday, while a well-placed backfire and strong marine
layer apparently helped them get the best of another large blaze near
Saugus.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by a steady breeze and extremely dry chaparral and pines,
Ventura County's Wolf fire in the Los Padres National Forest
continued to creep along steadily as firefighters worked to carve
more lines around the week-old blaze, which was about 40% contained,
according to California Department of Forestry officials.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from a dozen county, state and federal
agencies battled the blaze, aided by cooler temperatures and higher
humidity. Favorable weather conditions changed by midafternoon, when
gusts kicked up to 25 mph and raised concerns the blaze would spread
toward the Sespe Condor Sanctuary and Mutau Flats, a privately-owned
complex of six cabins. Both sites are about five miles from the fire.</LD>
<TE>   Bulldozers had carved a line around the cabin community, and
wildlife officials were monitoring condor chicks nesting within the
sanctuary, according to Ruth Norman, a spokeswoman with the
California Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   The Sespe Wilderness remained closed indefinitely, while
California 33 through Ojai was reopened Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 23,500-acre wildfire that began on Copper Hill Road
in San Francisquito Canyon was 55% contained late Saturday, and about
1,300 of 2,000 firefighters at the blaze were sent home. The
Saugus-area fire will not be fully contained, however, until
firefighters can cut a line around its entire perimeter, expected by
Friday, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy that it's not going anywhere right now," said
Capt. Henry Rodriguez, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. "There's always the possibility that it could pick up
from some hot embers, but we're keeping resources on the scene for
unexpected flare-ups," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Humidity from the overnight marine layer was so thick early
Saturday that firefighters battled one hot spot on Spunky Canyon Road
under the cover of fog. Those conditions changed to stiff winds by
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,100 Green Valley residents evacuated on Friday were kept
from their homes again for part of Saturday, although a controlled
burn gave them a margin of protection.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of favorable conditions, about 150 firefighters
launched flares into the hills at the edge of the tiny community,
then kept the flames under control until they burned away potential
fuel for the wildfire near homes.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Valenzuela, 43, a Green Valley resident who stayed through
the evacuation, said the backfire began only 40 yards from his house.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I heard a loud whoosh, and this pine tree went
up in flames, like a Roman candle," he said. "I was thinking, shoot,
those flames might come in my direction. There's no guarantee that
this will go the way they want it to."</TE>
<TE>   With the same thought in mind, crews kept a wary eye on the
hillsides late Saturday, as winds began kicking up again.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities lifted their evacuation orders at 6 p.m. and a caravan
of cars and trucks could be seen snaking through the canyon roads
back into Green Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As the caravan made its way up the winding roads, dozens of fire
engines and water tankers were making their way down. Grateful
residents honked, waved and gave them a thumbs-up.</TE>
<TE>   Warren and Cathay BeMiller, who as co-owners of the Heart N' Soul
Coffee House in Green Valley provided refreshments to firefighters,
stood on their patio and yelled out "welcome home" as the first
residents returned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see you back home," Warren called out to Mary Wall
as she pulled into town.</TE>
<TE>   She replied: "Thanks for taking care of the firemen so that they
could take care of our town."</TE>

<LD>Firefighters battled a 21,000-acre wildfire amid rising winds near
Ojai on Saturday, while a well-placed backfire and strong marine
layer apparently helped them get the best of another large blaze near
Saugus.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by a steady breeze and extremely dry chaparral and pines,
Ventura County's Wolf fire in the Los Padres National Forest
continued to creep along as firefighters worked to carve more lines
around the week-old blaze, which was about 40% contained, according
to California Department of Forestry officials.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from a dozen county, state and federal
agencies battled the blaze, aided by cooler temperatures and higher
humidity. Favorable weather conditions changed by midafternoon, when
gusts kicked up to 25 mph and raised concerns the blaze would spread
toward the Sespe Condor Sanctuary and Mutau Flats, a privately-owned
complex of six cabins. Both sites are about five miles from the fire.</LD>

<HD>Victims of Plane Crash Near Santa Paula Identified as Ojai
Retirees</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Former water district manager and his wife
were killed soon after takeoff Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people killed when their small airplane crashed shortly after
takeoff from Santa Paula Airport were identified Saturday as Ojai
retirees Charles and Barbara Curtis.</LD>
<LD>   Both died from injuries sustained in the crash, said James Baroni,
a senior deputy coroner's investigator.</LD>
<LD>   According to officials and friends, the couple were planning to
fly their four-seat Grumman Tiger to Minden, Nev., for a two-day
vacation.</LD>
<TE>   An aircraft salesman at the airport reported seeing the couple
taxiing on the runway between 9:30 and 10 a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   By 11:30 a.m., an oil company worker had spotted wreckage of the
plane about five miles south of the airport on a rugged slope below
South Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the crash, people working near the airport reported
overcast skies, a low cloud ceiling and fog.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash remained under investigation Saturday by
National Transportation Safety Board officials. Investigators are
looking into several possibilities, including weather conditions and
pilot error.</TE>
<TE>   Baroni said the autopsy of Charles Curtis, 74, showed no
indication he suffered a sudden medical emergency, such as a heart
attack or stroke.</TE>
<TE>   The crash investigation is expected to take several weeks,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   News of the deaths stunned the couple's friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Curtis had retired from the Navy after a military career
that began near the end of World War II. He served on the Ventura
County River Water District Board, along with his brother, John
Curtis, who is board president.</TE>
<TE>   Before retiring in December 2000, Curtis was the water district's
general manager for 13 years. He joined the five-member board in
August to fill a vacancy created by the death of another member.</TE>
<TE>   "He was well-loved. We are a small organization, just four people,
and we all looked to him kind of like a dad. This is just
devastating," said Janet Schaefer, who runs the district's small
office on Old Baldwin Road.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Curtis, 68, worked two days a week as a supervisor at the
Second Helping Thrift Store in Ojai, part of the Help of Ojai
organization that assists senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Hill, an activities director for Help of Ojai, said she
saw the couple Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I live down the street and I was driving to work and they drove
past me," Hill said. "She's a great volunteer and this is going to be
a huge shock to the people who work with her."</TE>
<TE>   Friends said the couple had been married more than 20 years and
each had children from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen Funeral Home in Ojai is handling the arrangements.</TE>

<HD>Signs Point to a Dangerous Fire Season</HD>
<DH>Nature: Lack of rain has left Southland vegetation at its
driest level in decades. Firefighters brace for a potentially busy
summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundred-foot flames leaping from ridgelines, huge choppers circling
overhead, exhausted firefighters trudging toward makeshift camps: The
grimly familiar sights of a Southern California late summer have
become the blight of late spring, and even residents beyond the range
of falling ash are bracing for the months ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The same grim conclusion comes from front-line firefighters and
from weather experts sitting at cutting-edge computers. Conditions in
the woods now are those of tinder-dry September, not milder, moister
June. The dozens of routine fires that have been quenched after
charring a few acres confirm it as much as the conflagrations that
have so far consumed more than 45,000 acres--the equivalent of more
than 70 square miles--around Saugus and Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   In northern Los Angeles County, the Copper fire has swept over
more than 25,000 acres, destroying at least nine homes and prompting
the evacuation of 1,100 residents.</LD>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the Wolf fire roared through the rugged back
country of the Sespe Wilderness, burning more than 20,000 acres.
Other wildfires have consumed more than 11,000 acres in the region
since the beginning of May.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the potential before us for a fire season of historic
proportions in Southern California," said Matt Mathes, a spokesman
for the U.S. Forest Service. "The fast growth of these fires, the
long flames, the intense heat, are unusual. The rate of spread is
high, the release of energy from brush is high and the dryness of the
vegetation is almost off the charts."</TE>
<TE>   In mid-April, officials throughout much of Southern California
opened fire season a month earlier than usual.</TE>
<TE>   After a winter of scant rain, it was more than an exercise in
bureaucratic caution. Even in the spring months, firefighters noticed
some disturbing signs. Fires burning beside streams were just as
furious as those in areas that weren't supposed to be cool and moist.
On a foggy morning with 85% humidity in Orange County, a small grass
fire raged unabated.</TE>
<TE>   "It surprised me so much that I had to go out there and see it for
myself," said Capt. Steve Miller of the Orange County Fire Authority.
"It was pretty indicative of just how dry things are."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County resident Jeanne Porter gazed with dismay at the
brown hills surrounding her home. "Dead ground," she called them,
adding that there hadn't been even a trickle in Trabuco Creek since
winter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the driest year I've ever seen," said Porter, a 24-year
resident of the canyon. "It's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Fire Department spokesman Joe Luna sounded the same
theme. The dry grasses blanketing the county and the dry skies last
winter created "a design for disaster," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 600 acres went up in smoke during the county's last fire
season. That's 3% of the land charred by the Wolf fire alone, with at
least five months left before rains are likely.</TE>
<TE>   From his office at the Interagency Fire Weather Center in
Riverside, Forest Service meteorologist Ron Hamilton pores over
records dating to 1924 and can find little precedent for the region's
current plight. The last four years in Southern California rival only
the early 1960s, the driest of Hamilton's recorded dry spells. And
the figures most worrisome to firefighters--those gauging moisture in
the plants that feed the fires--have rung alarm bells throughout the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "We can expect record dryness in fuels," Hamilton said. "We've
never seen them lower than we see them now, particularly at the
higher elevations."</TE>
<TE>   Supervising a five-member team and analyzing computerized graphs
with arcane titles like "1,000-Hour Dead Fuel Moisture," Hamilton
said the arid conditions are part of a normal, if not entirely
predictable cycle. "It's not something with a name, like El Nino," he
said. "Maybe El Dry-o."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it's called, this fire season will cost taxpayers
big-time.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the two major blazes still burning has so far cost a
total of at least $6.2 million, divided among federal, state and
local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has poured more money into Forest Service firefighting
efforts since the devastating fires at Los Alamos, N.M., and in
Montana two summers ago. Over the last two years, California's
forests have acquired an additional 30 firefighting crews, eight
helicopters and 56 fire engines, said agency spokesman Mathes.</TE>
<TE>   Local departments rely on the assistance of their counterparts
around the state to ease the burden. Meanwhile, the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention dips into an emergency
fund and routinely asks the Legislature for more.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the budget year, they make us whole," said
department spokeswoman Karen Terrill. "It's just a part of the
process."</TE>
<TE>   So is the dry spell, some scientists say. Tree rings reflect
"strongly developed dry periods" in California well before weather
records were kept, said Dan Cayan, director of climate research at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Cayan has his eye on another cycle that might spell relief. He
said the waters of the tropical Pacific seem to be warming,
suggesting an El Nino and the possibility of heavier-than-usual rains
in California next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't really help us this summer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ojai's Soule Park, the firefighters knew that all too well as
they took a breather from searing heat and the possibility of twisted
ankles, broken bones and inhaled poison oak.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning against a green Forest Service truck as his crew from
Tahoe National Forest wolfed down sandwiches, Jack McKenzie was still
streaked with black grit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still fresh," he said, "but this is the beginning of a long
season."</TE>

Riverside, Forest Service meteorologist Ron Hamilton pores over
records dating to 1924 and can find little precedent for the region's
current plight.</TE>
<TE>   The last four years in Southern California rival only the early
1960s, the driest of Hamilton's recorded dry spells. And the figures
most worrisome to firefighters--those gauging moisture in the plants
that feed the fires--have rung alarm bells throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We can expect record dryness in fuels," Hamilton said. "We've
never seen them lower than we see them now, particularly at the
higher elevations."</TE>
<TE>   Supervising a five-member team and analyzing computerized graphs
with arcane titles like "1,000-Hour Dead Fuel Moisture," Hamilton
said the arid conditions are part of a normal, if not entirely
predictable cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something with a name, like El Nino," he said. "Maybe El
Dry-o."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it's called, this fire season will cost taxpayers
big-time.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the two major blazes still burning has so far cost a
total of at least $6.2 million, divided among federal, state and
local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has poured more money into Forest Service firefighting
efforts since the devastating fires at Los Alamos, N.M., and in
Montana two summers ago. Over the last two years, California's
forests have acquired an additional 30 firefighting crews, eight
helicopters and 56 fire engines, said agency spokesman Mathes.</TE>
<TE>   Local departments rely on the assistance of their counterparts
around the state to ease the burden.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Prevention dips into an emergency fund and routinely asks the
Legislature for more.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the budget year, they make us whole," said
department spokeswoman Karen Terrill. "It's just a part of the
process."</TE>
<TE>   So is the dry spell, some scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   Tree rings reflect "strongly developed dry periods" in California
well before weather records were kept, said Dan Cayan, director of
climate research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Cayan has his eye on another cycle that might spell relief. He
said the waters of the tropical Pacific seem to be warming,
suggesting an El Nino and the possibility of heavier-than-usual rains
in California next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't really help us this summer," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gardeners Find Fertile New Ground at Schools</HD>
<DH>Manhattan Beach: After school district decides to sell
community gardens, longtime planters cut a deal to cultivate plots on
three campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sweet peas have gone to seed. The last of the lettuces have been
uprooted. And the once carefully tended community garden plots on
school district property in Manhattan Beach are now abandoned, with
only weeds sprouting on land being sold to help the school weather a
budget crunch.</LD>
<LD>   Closed down last month after a quarter-century at the northern
edge of Mira Costa High School, the Manhattan Beach Community Garden
and the Pea Patch Seniors Garden are going to be reincarnated on
three elementary school campuses. Under the terms of an agreement to
be signed this week, the gardeners will be given new plots at Grand
View, Meadows and Pacific schools, which already have campus gardens
that can benefit from the arrangement.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel like this is a case of being dealt lemons and making
lemonade. This really is a better situation than we had before,
because we will be more visible and we can help bring the benefits of
gardening to the younger generation," said Ann Barklow, a community
gardener who helped negotiate the new plots after efforts to save the
old gardens failed.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, things looked grim for the gardeners, many of whom
are elderly or have no room to grow corn, tomatoes, fava beans or
kale at home in the South Bay beach cities, where land is scarce and
pricey.</TE>
<TE>   The Manhattan Beach Unified School District, which had allowed
gardeners to use the small strip of surplus land, found itself facing
large cuts in state funding this year. Believing they could get up to
$1.6 million for the land, which is large enough for three houses,
district officials told the gardeners they had to be out by May 31.</TE>
<TE>   The eviction notice set gardeners scrambling for help from the
school board, the city, the local health district--and anyone else
who might help them raise money to buy the land or provide another
site that could accommodate the approximately 80 plots.</TE>
<TE>   They ran out of time, but as the gardeners gathered on May 30 at
the Mira Costa site to collect their tools and seedlings and to hold
a farewell party, negotiations were underway for the next generation
of gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "The district felt very bad about needing to sell the property and
[officials] wanted to see if there was a way to help out. I had
several principals approach me about having the gardeners move onto
their sites," said Marika  Bergsund, the district's garden
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Though there was no place big enough to accommodate all the
gardeners, the school district agreed to squeeze some new plots next
to student gardens at three of its five elementary campuses. The city
agreed to clear the sites, build new beds, and install irrigation
systems and fencing. The plots could be ready by July, just in time
for the community gardeners to move in and help maintain the school
gardens, which sometimes slide into neglect during summer break.</TE>
<TE>   District officials believe the students will learn from the older,
more experienced gardeners and expect both generations will benefit
from spending time with each other. There are plans to teach
youngsters how to compost and how to attract beneficial insects in
lieu of using pesticides--which will be forbidden in the new campus
gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "From the schools' perspective, this is just wonderful," Bergsund
said. "The older gardeners will bring a world of experience and
interests. And, as a secondary benefit, our children will get to
spend time with older adults, something we believe will benefit the
entire community."</TE>
<TE>   The community gardeners' arrival comes just as Manhattan Beach's
school gardens program is, well, growing and blossoming.</TE>
<TE>   Begun 2 1/2 years ago with a small grant from the state Department
of Education and money from the Beach Cities Health District, the
project has spread to all of the district's elementary schools and
will soon be added at the middle school. The gardens provide lessons
in nutrition and give students the chance to sample what they have
grown.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very affluent community but a densely packed one--not
many students have tomatoes growing at home," Bergsund said. When
some of the students at Pacific School first saw the tomato plants,
they asked Bergsund if they were strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   Community gardener Barklow hopes the program will expand to other
area schools--she already is talking with district officials in
neighboring Hermosa Beach about helping plant butterfly, native
wildflower and edible leaf gardens at Hermosa Valley School. She also
would like to see the gardens produce enough to help feed the South
Bay's elderly shut-ins and the needy, and to add raised plots for
gardeners who use wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the community gardeners have decided not to
participate in the new program, many are enthusiastic and have been
meeting to make plans and appoint a representative for each site to
act as a liaison with the host school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the gardeners, an architect, has offered to design the
community gardens at each site. Officials believe they can carve out
about 60 plots over the three campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Because they will be sharing their space with students, the
gardeners must undergo fingerprinting, be tested for tuberculosis,
wear ID badges while on campus and comply with other requirements
spelled out in the contract, which is subject to review annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me the school district has made us a pretty nice
offer," said Rudy Weaver, a retiree who enjoyed tending his flowers
and vegetables at the Mira Costa site.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the seniors wonder if gardening alongside youngsters will
work, but Weaver said, "Most of us are pretty happy that we are going
to get gardens, even though we had to go through a lot to get them."</TE>

<HD>Pupils Develop 'Habits of Heart' During Skits</HD>
<DH>An after-school and summer program uses role-playing to
teach sensitivity, empathy and compassion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kahlil Franklin doesn't know it yet, but he and his classmates are
about to take a crash course in social justice.</LD>
<LD>   In a skit designed to teach cultural sensitivity, Kahlil, 10, will
play the head of a janitorial company that is not paying immigrants
the same as their native-born counterparts. Melissa Douglas, 10, will
play an immigrant demanding equal pay for equal work.</LD>
<LD>   The issue might seem a bit intense for fifth-graders, but at the
Children's Enrichment Program, a nonprofit after-school and summer
program in Baldwin Hills, today's lesson is as rudimentary as reading
and writing.</LD>
<TE>   All lessons here are rooted in what they call habits of
heart--inherent qualities such as sensitivity, empathy and
compassion--and culminate in some sort of community service project.</TE>
<TE>   Every two weeks, the children tackle a different habit of heart.
They define the quality and get a clear understanding of what it
means before moving on to academic assignments and arts activities
meant to further expose the child to that human trait.</TE>
<TE>   During the conflict resolution and community service phases, they
learn how to apply habits of heart to real-life situations.</TE>
<TE>   It's called full circle learning, and Kahlil and Melissa are
almost there. But first Kahlil, the executive, and Melissa, the
oppressed laborer, must meet at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   They are positioned at opposite ends of a laminated sheet of paper
placed on the floor, known as the conflict resolution bridge.</TE>
<TE>   On the bridge--which resembles a hopscotch outline--there are
phrases such as I want ... I feel ... the reason I feel is ...</TE>
<TE>   With each step they take forward, the children repeat the phrase
and create their own ending, explaining their position. By the end of
the exercise, the two are face to face at the bridge's center and are
supposed to find some sort of peaceful solution.</TE>
<TE>   Kahlil and Melissa get off to a rough start.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be paid equally," Melissa says, and takes a step toward
Kahlil.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to get out of this country," Kahlil answers.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't pay us equally, and my family's dying of starvation and
sickness," Melissa says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not our fault your country doesn't have the same things we
do," Kahlil says. But after they have finally discussed it face to
face, Kahlil abruptly changes course and is swayed by Melissa's
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   They shake hands.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to explain his sudden shift, Kahlil tells his teacher, "It
just didn't sound fair that people from different countries are
getting paid less. It sounds like some Americans are being greedy."</TE>
<TE>   In real life, compromise is never that simple, but the exercise is
more about learning to solve conflicts than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its 10th year, the Children's Enrichment Program was
inspired by the 1992 riots, said Teresa Langness, executive board
chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "The building we're located in was at the fringes of the riots,"
Langness said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of fear, trauma, a little bit of a sense of
futility," she added. "There wasn't a sense that each of us had the
power to make the world better. We thought we needed to nurture their
learning and show them opportunities for community service."</TE>
<TE>   Langness, a 47-year-old freelance writer, was working at the Los
Angeles Baha'i Center when she and several others active at the
center saw this need.</TE>
<TE>   A few months after the riots, with donated space from the Baha'i
Center, the Children's Enrichment Program opened its doors. With a
lack of affordable, adequate child care in the area, the program had
no trouble filling its 15 spots.</TE>
<TE>   The program has grown to 30 children, all too young to remember
1992 and busy doing good deeds. Most of the participants are from
nearby Baldwin Hills Elementary School, except in the summer, when
the programs enrolls kids from all over Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the children, ages 6 to 11, have read to the
blind, volunteered at a senior citizens home and raised money for an
organization that donates wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   After a homeless woman with six children spoke to them about her
situation, they each brought in clothing, books and underwear for her
children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about creating a well-rounded child," said Jeri Reed, whose
10-year-old son, Jaleel, has been in the program since first grade.
"He's always been an even-tempered child, but this reinforces his
personality. He's more helpful and cooperative, and he knows why it's
important. He's not just doing it because an adult told him to."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, the lesson on cultural sensitivity comes
full circle.</TE>
<TE>   The children prepare for a visit to the Longwood Manor
Convalescent Hospital, where they will entertain their "adopted
grandparents" with rousing renditions of "Lean on Me," "This Little
Light of Mine" and "You Are So Beautiful," followed by a
question-and-answer session with the adults about culture.</TE>
<TE>   Class extroverts Keegan McFadden and Kyle Key, both 9, ham it up
for the seniors, most of whom stare at them seriously. One man,
wearing Mardi Gras beads, sings along and a woman claps to the beat.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle, Keegan and Jade Romain, also 9, interview a very patient
Charles Kessee, 62. They ask him what he likes best about his culture
and what their cultures share in common.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all originally from the Southern Hemisphere," he tells
them. "Africa was the first civilization, you know." The children
listen politely as he tells them about life in Los Angeles 30 years
ago and about his struggles to provide for his many children.</TE>
<TE>   Kessee said he enjoys the children's visits.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very enthusiastic kids," Kessee said. "Some of us just
don't get a chance to see our grandchildren, so this is nice."</TE>

<HD>George L. Graziadio Jr., 82; Noted Philanthropist
Co-Founded Southland-Based Imperial Bancorp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNETTE HADDAD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George L. Graziadio Jr., the feisty, risk-taking shopping center
developer who co-founded his own bank out of frustration with the
poor service that large banks offered entrepreneurs like himself and
in the process built one of Southern California's largest financial
institutions, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Graziadio, who was also a major donor to charities and
universities, particularly Pepperdine, died of cancer Thursday at his
home on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   He was chairman of Comerica Bank-California, which until last year
was Imperial Bancorp, the Inglewood-based financial institution
Graziadio founded with long-time partner George Eltinge in 1963 to
serve small and medium-size businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Detroit-based Comerica acquired Imperial Bancorp for $1.3 billion
in stock.</TE>
<TE>   By specializing in loans to niches of key Southland industries
such as entertainment and technology, Imperial had grown into one of
the region's biggest banks, with $7.4 billion in assets and 15
branches.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Graziadio gave $15 million to the business school at
Pepperdine University in Malibu--at the time one the largest gifts
ever to a business school. Pepperdine later named the school for him.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vernon, Conn., to Italian and Irish immigrants, Graziadio
grew up living above his grandfather's Italian grocery. He began
working for his father, a real estate auctioneer, at 14.</TE>
<TE>   Graziadio settled in California after World War II and met
Eltinge, who was already involved in commercial real estate
development, in the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Graziadio impressed Eltinge by luring a prime tenant to an Eltinge
shopping center at Crenshaw Boulevard and Imperial Highway in Los
Angeles. Their partnership evolved from that experience. They went on
to build about 100 shopping centers in California and elsewhere in
the West, mostly for Kmart stores.</TE>
<TE>   The "two Georges," as they were known in business circles,
appeared a strange match. The wiry and soft-spoken Eltinge was often
described as the dreamer, while Graziadio, a heavyset 6-footer,
referred to himself as "the nuts-and-bolts guy." Eltinge died in 1994
at age 76.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, after years of frustrating encounters with cautious
lenders, they founded Imperial by collecting $1.25 million from
family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's lending policies catered to the underserved "middle
market" of small and medium-sized companies and created a lucrative
business by making loans to targeted niches within California's
changing industrial mix, from risky tech start-ups to local garment
makers and movie projects.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the bank's entertainment division grew to be the largest
financer of feature films in the world, and Imperial was an early
lender to a fledgling Web portal that became Yahoo Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial also earned a reputation within the industry as a
super-aggressive "go-go" lender that often made deals with customers
whom other banks would have turned away as bad credit risks.</TE>
<TE>   Graziadio would brush off such criticism, saying his bank tended
to think more about business than image.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd prefer to make 10 $10,000 loans than one $100,000 loan,"
Graziadio told The Times in 1997. "That way you have 10 customers who
go tell 10 other businesspeople about you."</TE>
<TE>   Graziadio and his partner had a lot of fun, especially in the
early days of running the bank.</TE>
<TE>   For one bank opening, they brought in a full-grown lion (which was
the bank's mascot). Another time, they dropped $1 bills out of a
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Ever the effusive businessman, Graziadio refused to retire even
after he entered his 80s.</TE>
<TE>   "The thrill of the chase is more important than getting to the
goal," he told the Los Angeles Business Journal in 1996. "Retirement,
quite frankly, has never been a goal of mine."</TE>
<TE>   Immensely proud of his Italian heritage, Graziadio donated more
than $650,000 to Cal State Long Beach to create a Center for Italian
Studies, which also bears his name, and a chair of Italian language
studies. The boardroom at Imperial Bancorp's headquarters on La
Cienega Boulevard was probably one of the few in America where there
was a constant smell of garlic coming from the executive kitchen,
observers have noted, because Graziadio served Italian food at
company meetings.</TE>
<TE>   An aviation buff, he paid about $25,000 to join 30 other
aficionados on a 24-hour trip around the world on the Concorde to
celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Western
Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his contributions to others that may have more lasting
value.</TE>
<TE>   His donation to Pepperdine allowed the business school to increase
the size of its faculty by 30% and help it become the biggest such
school west of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Graziadio praised Pepperdine's "resourcefulness,"
which he said appealed to him as an entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   "His vision and leadership propelled the Graziadio School to a
preeminent position among business schools worldwide," Pepperdine
President Andrew K. Benton said in a statement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Graziadio was honored for his charity work by
dozens of organizations.</TE>
<TE>   He was named the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s humanitarian of the
year in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a founding director of the Torrance Memorial Medical
Center Health Care Foundation and a member of several local boards,
including that of the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, he received the Horatio Alger Award in Washington.
Other recipients have included President Eisenhower and Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Graziadio is survived by his wife of 59 years, Reva; daughters
Mary Lou Area and Alida Calvillo; son G. Louis Graziadio III; nine
grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held Tuesday at Pepperdine's Firestone
Fieldhouse.</TE>

<HD>Signe Hasso, 91; Swede Acted for Leading Movie Directors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signe Hasso, a Swedish-born stage and film actress who played strong
leading ladies in American movies in the 1940s, most notably in
George Cukor's "A Double Life," has died. She was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Hasso died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Her father and grandfather died when she was 4, and her mother
supported the family by making waffles. Hasso lived with her mother,
grandmother, sister and brother in a one-room apartment in Stockholm.</LD>
<TE>   At 12, she fell into acting work somewhat by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "A playmate of mine who used to act took ill. She was the niece of
a stage manager, and so he asked her if she knew of any other little
girl who could act, and she gave him my name," she told the Swedish
Press.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 12 then and didn't want to go and neither did my sister, so
my mother flipped a coin. I lost," she said. "My mother promised me
an orange if I would go. They were very rare in those days. And so,
with an orange in my pocket, I went to the Royal Dramatic Theater."</TE>
<TE>   Her audition for the role in a Moliere play was a success. She
started earning a living as an actress and, despite her family's
economic situation, was able to attend one of the better schools in
Stockholm.</TE>
<TE>   At 16 she was back at the Royal Dramatic Theater as a student--the
youngest acting pupil in its history. By age 19 she was married and
had a baby.</TE>
<TE>   Hasso found work in Swedish films and in theater throughout
Scandinavia.</TE>
<TE>   She came to Hollywood in 1940 and signed a contract with RKO, but
few acting roles materialized.</TE>
<TE>   As she later said, she was nearly out on the street when she
decided to go to New York, where she found work in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of World War II, she returned to Hollywood and
signed a contract with MGM. Over the next few years Hasso worked with
some of the industry's leading directors.</TE>
<TE>   She made Fred Zinnemann's "The Seventh Cross" with Spencer Tracy,
Cecil B. DeMille's "The Story of Dr. Wassell" with Gary Cooper, Henry
Hathaway's "The House on 92nd Street" with Lloyd Nolan, and Richard
Brooks' first movie as a director, "Crisis," with Cary Grant.</TE>
<TE>   But her favorite and the movie that critics apparently liked best
was 1947's "A Double Life." It starred Ronald Colman as an actor so
immersed in playing Othello that his stage character takes possession
of his off-screen personality. Hasso played his wife, and Colman won
the best actor Academy Award for his performance.</TE>
<TE>   After the death of her son in a car accident in 1957, Hasso
returned to Scandinavia to work in theater and movies.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the rest of her American career was spent in character
roles on television, including the miniseries "QB VII" and the movie
"Evita Peron."</TE>
<TE>   A writer and lyricist, Hasso made perhaps her final TV appearance
last year in a documentary on her legendary friend and countrywoman,
actress Greta Garbo.</TE>
<TE>   Information on survivors was not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills Boy, 14, in Street</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Garden Grove youth is shot while paying a
cabdriver. The killer may have followed him home from an Internet
cafe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old Garden Grove boy was fatally shot early Saturday
morning by a gunman who apparently followed the youth's taxicab when
it left a local Internet cafe, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Fernandez was shot about 12:50 a.m. at the intersection of
Lampson Avenue and Adelle Street as he paid the taxi fare for himself
and three friends, said Sgt. Mike Handfield of the Garden Grove
Police Department. He was taken to UC Irvine Medical Center in
Orange, where he died of multiple gun wounds.</LD>
<LD>   Edward had spent the evening with seven friends at the I.C.E.
Internet Cafe in the 12200 block of Brookhurst Street. He had arrived
there about 6:30 p.m. to watch the NBA Finals. Dozens of youngsters
were at the cafe playing video games, shooting pool and cheering the
Lakers or the New Jersey Nets, said manager Quang Nguyen, who worked
the night shift Friday.</LD>
<TE>   But the atmosphere of celebration was interrupted by a group of
youths who were loitering in front of the cafe, Nguyen said. He saw
at least four cars slowly cruising in the parking lot outside. The
occupants of the cars were loud and intimidating, he said. Nguyen
called the Garden Grove police gang unit, saying the youths looked
like gang members to him and he was afraid they might harm his young
customers.</TE>
<TE>   When police responded, the youths drove off, Handfield said. He
added that the police could not confirm if those youths were involved
in the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   It was also unknown whether any of the youths in the cars were
gang members. Handfield said Edward and his friends were not believed
to have gang connections.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen said the cafe had closed earlier Friday as a precaution
because he felt something bad could happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we want is this place to be safe, but when kids
are going to cause trouble, they do it anywhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Nguyen acknowledged that Garden Grove has a 10 p.m.
curfew for minors. He said that Edward and his friends had gone in
and out of the cafe during the evening, that he was not there the
entire time, and that the last time they came in, shortly before
midnight, he told them they would have to go home. Police said they
would investigate why the youngsters were at an Internet cafe that
late in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids were in violation of the curfew law, and the cafe was in
violation of the ordinance that requires children to leave after a
certain hour," Handfield said.</TE>
<TE>   The boys waited outside for the cab, which took nearly half an
hour to arrive, Handfield said. During that time, they exchanged
dirty looks with the passengers of a black compact car in the parking
lot. Police say the car followed the cab, which took Edward and three
friends close to the home of one of the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Eyewitnesses and neighbors say that a passenger in the black car
approached the cab as soon as it stopped at the 12500 block of Adelle
Street. The three friends walked on ahead, but Edward remained in the
cab to pay the fare. The gunman approached the taxi and shot Edward
several times.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Alderete, 19, who lives in the area, said he heard at least
four gunshots. He came out to the street minutes later to see Edward
lying on the ground with wounds to the chest.</TE>
<TE>   But neither he nor other witnesses were able to provide police
with a detailed description of the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon, a few flowers and two candles lay on the
sidewalk where the shooting occurred as neighbors fretted over the
most recent violent incident in an area that they say is plagued by
gangs, violence and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to raise two good kids in here and I don't think this
is the place for them," said Phyny Canyavong, 25, who moved to the
neighborhood four months ago. He said he struggled to explain to his
5-year-old son the meaning of the candles burning near his home.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Garden Grove took steps to regulate Internet cafes,
restricting the number of computers, setting a mandatory closing time
of 2 a.m. and requiring surveillance cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The changes followed several crimes, mostly in parking areas of
the cafes, which draw video enthusiasts who play computer games. The
most serious incident was the Dec. 30 stabbing death of a 20-year-old
outside the PC Cafe on Garden Grove Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent incident shocked Edward Fernandez's family.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's uncle, John Ochoa, said his nephew was an avid football
and baseball player, and a devout Christian who was never drawn to
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to understand why things happen the way they do," he
said. "He was the victim of random violence."</TE>

<HD>On Secession Issue, the Real Potholes Are Leaders' Failures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While tooling along last week with the radio going, I heard a
Hollywood secessionist work herself into a lather over the pothole at
the end of her street. For a moment, I thought I was on the East
Coast, where the weather carves craters big enough to decide
elections.</LD>
<LD>   I never expected to find pothole politics in Southern California.
Then came secession, and now I keep hearing that the pothole is a
symbol of broken-down government in Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not sure what roads these folks are traveling, because I cover
a lot of ground by automobile and have not encountered any impasses.
What's a few chuckholes, anyway? Half the drivers out there are in
SUVs the size of German panzers. They could cruise Bryce Canyon
without testing the springs.</LD>
<TE>   That's not to say city services are fine and dandy. They could
stand some improvement, same as with every other city I've known. In
Los Angeles, which was stretched into distant frontiers by barons and
thieves, it's fair to wonder if we're just too big to function
cleanly.</TE>
<TE>   So no, secession isn't a completely nutty notion, although the
borough proposals are smarter by a mile. Either way, it's refreshing
that people are talking about something other than a Laker
three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with these fiddlers, unfortunately, is that Nero is
their muse.</TE>
<TE>   On one side we've got L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn, whose plan for more
left-turn lanes is perhaps his most ambitious work to date. At the
occasional rally to save L.A., Hahn can't seem to draw more than 50
people, and I'm beginning to wonder if some of them are cardboard
props.</TE>
<TE>   Then you've got the titans from Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller is Better," reads a proclamation on the secessionists'
official Web site. The new Valley city is likened to San Diego,
Dallas, San Antonio and Phoenix, and then we get this little gem of
an observation: "When you enter these cities the blight, the poverty,
the crime, the gangs and the graffiti virtually disappear."</TE>
<TE>   We're lucky these guys aren't travel agents. I once spent three
weeks in Phoenix, chasing a story about how the ambush murder of a
white cop by Latino drug dealers nearly touched off a race war in a
gang-ravaged part of town.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE is peddling a safe and happy place where you can have
every little thing your heart desires, even after you vote for Prop.
13 and every other tax-cutting measure. The only problem is that no
such place exists.</TE>
<TE>   Cities are gloriously imperfect, evolving places, forever in
conflict with their own histories, and that is their appeal. They
stumble and strive, they falter and thrive. You want a spoonful of
sugar, go somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is spectacular in a thousand ways and flawed in just
as many, but the fixes for education and dirty air and the daily
nightmare of getting from here to there aren't even on the table in
all the talk of secession.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, redraw the boundaries if you must, change the rules,
whatever.</TE>
<TE>   But building a newer and better Los Angeles, one in which the
quality of life is significantly improved for everyone, has nothing
to do with whether it's carved into smaller pieces. It begins with a
complete re-imagining of how we get places, and Mayor Hahn's
left-turn lanes are not the inspiration I'm talking about.</TE>
<TE>   The rail line that moves the most people in Southern California is
at Disneyland. We've got a transit authority that spent a fortune in
court to avoid buying more buses, and we've got a mayor who lacked
the spine to support a perfectly sensible new busway in the Valley,
simply because a few neighbors objected.</TE>
<TE>   As motorists, we're champs. Some people in the world are eating
grass soup while others look skyward for falling nukes, and here in
sunny Southern California we've got a pothole posse worried about
throwing out their front-end alignment.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what, folks. It was America's insatiable thirst for oil that
led directly to the national security threat we all fear today. Saudi
Arabia grew the bulk of the terrorists who came after us on our own
soil, and still, the U.S. looks the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   So we can keep buying their oil.</TE>
<TE>   So we can avoid a single personal sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   So we can keep inching along in tank-size cars on ever-busier
stretches of the Hollywood, Harbor and Ventura freeways.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost like sending checks to the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Where are L.A.'s screaming populists on these counts?</TE>
<TE>   The city can and should re-imagine itself in ways that suit our
needs and those of a changed world. But where are the politicians
willing to connect the dots, scold us, challenge us, lead us?</TE>
<TE>   Stuck in traffic, maybe, if not swallowed whole by these potholes
I keep hearing about.</TE>

<LD>The latest wave of thousands of tiny red pelagic crabs that have been
washing up on Southern California beaches in recent weeks drew stares
at Orange County beaches Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The crabs, which migrate north on warm currents from Baja, "swim
like a lobster, have claws like crabs but they also resemble shrimp,
except they are bright red," said Chris Clarke, Huntington Beach
marine safety supervisor. The crabs periodically wash ashore, die and
get carried back into the surf. They appear every six to 10 years in
a pattern that's entirely natural.</LD>

<HD>Birds in Westminster Are Frustrated, and This Woodsman
Blames the City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In any dispute between city bureaucracy and a 76-year-old bird lover
with cats named Henrietta and Mr. Finnegan, is there a question which
side to be on?</LD>
<LD>   So, I'm with Thaddeus Laird in his gripe against Westminster, not
knowing for sure if he's right but admiring his passion.</LD>
<LD>   Laird was looking out his window last week when he saw a
tree-trimming crew coming by on Pyle Circle, where he and his wife
have raised a family over the last 38 years. The crew set its sights
on a 30-foot Australian pepper tree next door and began doing its
thing. Laird was aghast, knowing the tree to be the home of three
sets of doves, a mockingbird couple and a pair of hummingbirds.
"There were five families there," he says.</LD>
<TE>   I'd normally be skeptical of someone's certainty about such a
thing, but Laird assures me that he's a woodsman from way back,
having grown up in Savannah, Ga., and then becoming a craftsman in
wood. He convinces me by showing me dozens of wooden bowls,
containers and other items he's made over the years. In addition, he
pulls out a third-place ribbon he won at the 1994 Orange County Fair
for a lovely bowl. OK, the man knows his wood and his trees.</TE>
<TE>   I ask him to describe what he saw with the cutting crew.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," he says. "I was really quite perturbed. They
came in like the Army. Two big trucks with cherry-pickers. They just
devastated the trees, really. They bumped the little birds out of
their nests. The cats didn't mind. They got a few of the babies."</TE>
<TE>   Laird is a little short on evidence. He can't produce a fallen
nest for me, because, he says, the truck that trails the
cherry-picker scoops up the fallen limbs and grinds them into mulch.
That's where the nests went--along with an unknown number of baby
birds, he says.</TE>
<TE>   That makes his case a circumstantial one. "You got anything else?"
I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "A baby bird got knocked right out of the tree," he says. "I went
to pick it up, but Henrietta beat me to it. So, [the bird] didn't go
to waste. It went back to nature."</TE>
<TE>   Any other proof of what happened?</TE>
<TE>   "Doves have been flying around ever since," he says, "looking for
a new mate. They're frustrated. You can tell a frustrated bird."</TE>
<TE>   A good reporter would have asked a follow-up question, but I
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fowler, the public works director for Westminster, couldn't
have been more cordial in discussing Laird's complaint. Problem is,
Fowler hadn't heard anything about it until I called and, as a
result, couldn't do much about it.</TE>
<TE>   He says, however, that the city's tree-trimming policy is to avoid
cutting down branches where birds are nesting. In his four years on
the job, Fowler says, he's never heard a complaint about birds being
rousted by the crews.</TE>
<TE>   The workers on Laird's street probably were from a private company
under contract to the city, as opposed to being city employees,
Fowler says. A person who took my call at the company said no one was
available to respond to Laird's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the matter rests. Laird still was unhappy at week's
end, questioning why crews would be cutting trees this time of year
when, according to him, "they're in early bloom." That period, he
says, runs roughly from late April to mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   Laird concedes that he didn't complain to City Hall. Fowler says
he would have been happy to discuss the matter had Laird telephoned.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing more tree-trimming now than in recent years," Fowler
says. "We're catching up. There was a time when we didn't have funds
and weren't doing any tree-trimming."</TE>
<TE>   Laird is a former Marine recruiter and postal carrier. He faces
eye surgery later this month and has a bit of a hearing problem. As
we stand outside his house, he spots a mockingbird on a phone line
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "When I used to have teeth, I could whistle what he wanted to
hear," he says.</TE>
<TE>   We shake hands, and I ask Laird if he can put the birds' nest
incident behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I rebound quickly," he says. "But this aggravated the crap out of
me."</TE>

<HD>RFK Jr. Urges Shoppers to Buy Organic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged consumers Saturday to buy organically
grown and raised food to promote clean water and support family
farms.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy, president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, launched the Pure
Farms-Pure Water campaign at the Health &amp; Harmony Festival, along
with George Siemon of Organic Valley, a national brand owned by a
number of organic farmers across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy said many small family farms are turning to organic
farming to stay alive.</LD>
<TE>   "The American landscape is now being transformed with a few large,
multinational corporations that are taking over produce production,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, an environmental attorney and son of the slain senator,
said pesticides and fertilizers used by the corporations are finding
their way into the country's waterways. He hoped the campaign would
encourage consumers to spend their money on organic food.</TE>
<TE>   To carry the "USDA Organic" label, food must now meet U.S.
Department of Agriculture standards.</TE>
<TE>   The standards were to be implemented over 18 months beginning in
February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The rules ban pesticides, genetic engineering, growth hormones and
irradiation of organic foods, and require dairy cattle to have access
to pasture.</TE>
<TE>   The federal guidelines replace a hodgepodge of state rules and
varying private certification standards.</TE>
<TE>   But some farmers have said they could be harmed by the
one-size-fits-all government standards.</TE>

<HD>Security Is Tight at Redwood Run Biker Festival</HD>
<DH>Safety: Authorities are on guard against a repeat of
violence between the warring Mongols, Hells Angels motorcycle clubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARBERVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Thousands of motorcyclists who came to this Northern California hill
country for an annual biker festival were met with unprecedented
security this weekend as authorities guarded against a repeat of
violence between the warring Mongols and Hells Angels gangs.</LD>
<LD>   California Highway Patrol helicopters and aircraft patrolled the
skies over the riverside festival site 12 miles south of Garberville.</LD>
<LD>   A Mendocino County Sheriff's Department official said staffing had
been doubled to about 80 officers, while festival organizers said the
fear of violence led to a slight decline in attendance. By Saturday
evening, there had been no reports of violence and no Mongols had
arrived.</LD>
<TE>   The historically peaceful Redwood Run, which this year marks its
25th anniversary, annually attracts more than 7,000 leather-garbed
bikers, ranging in background from San Francisco professionals to
hard-core outlaw club members.</TE>
<TE>   Some bikers sleep in tents. Others bunk in local hotels and dine
at restaurants with extensive wine lists. The unifying factors are
the Harley-Davidson bikes that most ride.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my fifth Redwood Run," San Francisco plumbing salesman
Paul Seifert, 41, said as he stood next to his 1990 Harley
Electraglide on Garberville's main drag. "I come here to relax, watch
the bands and have a mellow time."</TE>
<TE>   The Redwood Run is the first major West Coast biker meeting since
an April shootout at a casino in Laughlin, Nev. Two Mongols and a
Hells Angel were killed. A second Hells Angel was gunned down on the
road outside town.</TE>
<TE>   Since the April 27 incident, state and federal law enforcement
officials say they expect more trouble between the two gangs, which
appear to be fighting over territory in central and Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Two motorcycle events planned in Ventura County were canceled last
month. But state law enforcement officials are gearing up for another
big biker event set for July 5-7 in the Central Coast city of
Hollister, which is expected to draw 50,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Redwood Run organizer Doug McCauley, a contractor and member of
the Kiwanis Club that sponsors the event, dismissed fears of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement has been a little too intense since Laughlin and
the general post-9/11 paranoia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCauley said, however, that he had instructed guards at the front
gate to prevent members of the Mongols gang from entering.</TE>
<TE>   The Mongols, a largely Latino club centered in Southern
California, do not generally roam this far north, while several Hells
Angels chapters, from Vallejo, Sonoma and Daly City, arrive in large
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   McCauley added a heliport to the festival site to aid in emergency
evacuations if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Mendocino County Sheriff's Lt. Thomas Allman estimated that 100
Hells Angels members and prospective members were at this year's
Redwood Run event.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, we had a few Mongols but we haven't seen any
since," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Allman said he has worked the Redwood Run event for 16 years. Like
McCauley, he thinks that state and federal officials have been overly
concerned about the possibility of violence here.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal authorities, he said, had to be dissuaded from
coming to Mendocino County in force and taking over.</TE>
<TE>   "They must have thought we were Andy Griffith and Barney Fife,"
Allman said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday evening, deputies had made fewer than a dozen arrests,
almost all drug and alcohol violations by bikers as they were leaving
the festival grounds, Allman said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the activities were limited to the festival. An
estimated 2,000 bikers do not attend the sold-out festival, but come
to drink in the ambience.</TE>
<TE>   One Hells Angels chapter rented a cottage at the upscale Benbow
Inn, dining late into the night on 16-ounce "Harley Special" steaks
offered by the hotel, which has a 500-label wine list.</TE>
<TE>   For two days, the sign leading into this town is changed to
"Harleyville" and, to the delight of local merchants, the streets are
packed with free-spending bikers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those assembled at the main festival site, a former dude
ranch on the Eel River, settled into a routine of heavy beer drinking
and pot smoking, sometimes shedding their clothes to bask in the
afternoon sun.</TE>
<TE>   Because the festival takes place on private property, sheriff's
deputies do not patrol the grounds, leaving the main security to a
Sacramento motorcycle association.</TE>
<TE>   This delights the Hells Angels, who have a half-century running
battle with law enforcement at all levels.</TE>
<TE>   What has not been pleasing, said a Hells Angel named Addison, who
was manning a souvenir booth for the group's Vallejo chapter, is
extra security added outside the festival site because of the
Laughlin incident.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Hells Angels, Addison, who declined to give his last
name, would not say what he or other members would do if a Mongols
club member walked into the Redwood Run event.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a question without an answer," Addison said to the
nodding agreement of another Hells Angel sitting at his side. "It is
like asking what I will do if it rains tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>Saugus Blaze Halted as Weather Turns</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: With the 23,500-acre burn area partially
dampened, grateful residents of Green Valley return home Saturday.
Winds still a threat in Ojai fire.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aided by a second day of cooler temperatures and higher humidity,
firefighters got the upper hand Saturday on the 23,500-acre wildfire
that began on Copper Hill Road in San Francisquito Canyon, allowing
residents to return to their homes.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the 1,100 residents who fled Thursday returned to the
Green Valley area while as many as 1,300 of 2,000 firefighters who
had battled the 4-day-old blaze were sent home. The Saugus-area fire
was 55% contained, but firefighters must still cut a line around its
perimeter, expected by Friday, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire destroyed at least nine homes.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very happy that it's not going anywhere right now," said
Capt. Henry Rodriguez, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. "There's always the possibility that it could pick up
from some hot embers, but we're keeping resources on the scene for
unexpected flare-ups," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Humidity from the overnight marine layer was so thick early
Saturday that firefighters battled one hot spot on Spunky Canyon Road
under the cover of fog. Those conditions changed to stiff winds by
the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Valley residents evacuated on Friday were kept from
their homes again Saturday, although a controlled burn gave them a
margin of protection.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of favorable conditions, about 150 firefighters
launched flares into the hills at the edge of the tiny community,
then kept flames under control until they burned off the potential
fuel near homes.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Valenzuela, 43, a Green Valley resident who stayed through
the evacuation, said the backfire began only 40 yards from his house.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I heard a loud whoosh, and this pine tree went
up in flames, like a Roman candle," he said. "I was thinking, shoot,
those flames might come in my direction. There's no guarantee that
this will go the way they want it to."</TE>
<TE>   With the same thought in mind, crews kept a wary eye on the
hillsides late Saturday, as winds began kicking up again.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities lifted their evacuation orders about 6 p.m. and a
caravan of cars and trucks could be seen snaking through the canyon
roads back into Green Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As the vehicles headed up the winding roads, dozens of fire
engines and water tankers were making their way down. Grateful
residents honked, waved and gave them a thumbs up.</TE>
<TE>   Warren and Cathay BeMiller, who as co-owners of the Heart N' Soul
Coffee House in downtown Green Valley provided refreshments to
firefighters, stood on their patio and yelled "welcome home" as
residents returned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see you back home," Warren BeMiller called out to
Mary Wall as she pulled into town.</TE>
<TE>   She replied, "Thanks for taking care of the firemen so that they
could take care of our town."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, firefighters battled a 21,000-acre wildfire amid rising
winds near Ojai on Saturday, which officials said was 40% contained
as of Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by a steady breeze and extremely dry chaparral and pines,
Ventura County's Wolf fire in Los Padres National Forest continued to
creep along as firefighters worked to carve more lines around the
week-old blaze, according to California Department of Forestry
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from a dozen county, state and federal
agencies battled the blaze, aided by cooler temperatures and higher
humidity. Favorable weather conditions changed by midafternoon, when
gusts kicked up to 25 mph and raised concerns the blaze would spread
toward the Sespe Condor Sanctuary and Mutau Flats, a privately owned
complex of six cabins. Both sites are about five miles from the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Bulldozers had carved a line around the cabin community, and
wildlife officials were monitoring condor chicks nesting within the
sanctuary.</TE>

<HD>Simon Takes Stand Against Offshore Drilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. said Saturday that
he is against any new oil drilling off the coast of California, and
pledged to work with the Bush administration to negotiate buyouts of
36 undeveloped federal leases off the state's southern coast.</LD>
<LD>   "I strongly oppose further offshore oil development and additional
drilling, and it is time to phase out our offshore oil platforms,"
Simon said in a speech before a conference of radio and television
journalists. "Further development could endanger our coastline--and
with it our quality of life, our beaches, our marine life, and
essential industries like tourism.</LD>
<LD>   "By contrast, our proven onshore reserves are nearly 15% of total
reserves in the nation. That's where the state should be working to
improve production, on shore."</LD>
<TE>   The 36 undeveloped leases, which cover plots of sea floor off the
coasts of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, have
been a source of controversy between California and the federal
government for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   They are currently the subjects of a legal and political battle
between Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and the Bush administration. They
also provide a natural point of contention between Simon and Davis,
as Simon attempts to convert his victory in this spring's Republican
primary into a general election win over the incumbent Davis. Simon
won the primary largely on the strength of his conservative support,
but to win in November, he will need the backing of moderates and
some Democrats, because Democrats hold a commanding majority among
registered voters in California.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton rejected Davis'
request that the federal government buy back offshore drilling
rights, as it did last week in Florida. President Bush pledged $235
million to buy back offshore oil and gas leases in Florida, where his
brother Jeb is governor and running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Davis has passed up opportunities to negotiate with the
federal government over the undeveloped leases, and claimed that his
opponent has permitted offshore drilling to increase under existing
state and federal leases. "He claims to be against new drilling,
while his administration has dramatically expanded drilling with
dozens of new wells and existing wells that have been deepened or
re-drilled during his administration."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign said 11 new wells have been drilled from offshore
oil platforms in state waters and that 25 existing wells have been
deepened or re-drilled since Davis took office.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's press secretary, Roger Salazar, said the Davis
administration has a legal obligation to honor the existing leases,
which allow for new drilling to take place as long as it passes state
scrutiny in terms of safety and environmental guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "The state doesn't have the right to block that," Salazar said.
"These companies own these leases, so they have the legal right to
drill on the leases they own. If the state were to block them, they
would have to have the legal resources to do so, or it would
constitute a 'taking.' The state obviously honors its commitments,
but the governor doesn't want to see any new ones."</TE>
<TE>   A Davis administration official said the existing leases don't
leave much opportunity to prevent new wells from being drilled. "On
an ongoing basis, it's very difficult to turn down wells in specific
existing leases," said Paul Thayer, executive officer of the State
Lands Commission. "All these leases go back at least as far as 1968,
and once they're already developed, there's this implication that the
state has authorized the development.</TE>
<TE>   "For [Simon] to try to turn this issue on its head is not only
ludicrous, it's the height of hypocrisy," Salazar said. "Bill Simon
is so steeped in oil and gas money that he drips when he walks."</TE>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged Saturday that he has investments in energy
companies, but said he does not have an interest in firms that drill
for oil off the California coast. According to his campaign, Simon's
holdings do include interests in SeaRiver Maritime, an oil tanker
business that is an Exxon subsidiary; and in Seacor Smit Inc., a firm
specializing in oil spill cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's comments on this issue followed quickly on the heels of
Davis' rebuff by the Bush administration. And Simon suggested
Saturday that he could have better success than the governor when it
comes to negotiating for California's interests with the Republican
White House. "I probably would have tried to contact the
administration orally, instead of just firing a letter over the
transom," Simon said. "I would re-contact the [Bush] administration
and try to do it without the paper shuffle by trying to transcend the
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has thus far successfully used the courts to block any new
oil platforms off California's coast, rejecting settlement talks and
vowing to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The
Bush administration has asked a federal court to allow new drilling.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign has been in recent contact with representatives
from the White House and the Interior Department on the issue, said
Sean Walsh, a senior GOP strategist who was on hand for Simon's
address.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said the issue of offshore drilling provides
Simon with a simple, noncontroversial way to reposition himself
toward the political center.</TE>
<TE>   "In the catechism of California politics, this is an easy one.
He'd have to be a damn fool not to oppose offshore oil drilling,"
said Democratic political strategist Bill Carrick. "This allows Simon
to look like he's independent from the [Bush] administration and the
hard line environmental policies that aren't popular in California,
and also to make sure voters on the coast of California know he cares
about this."</TE>
<TE>   "He's trying to inoculate himself against Davis' strongest charge,
which is that Simon is out of step with the positions and opinions of
California," said USC political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "I
think it is very interesting that he is making the argument that he
can get more out of the Republican administration than Davis can.
Clearly, it's true."</TE>

<HD>Students Use Peer Pressure to Douse Teen Smoking</HD>
<DH>Health: Some youths have become activists to keep
classmates from lighting up. The local movement mirrors state and
national trends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day Layza Lopez had her sixth birthday party, her father, only
35, clutched his chest in pain and was rushed to the hospital with a
heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   He survived, but was told he must quit the smoking habit he picked
up as a youth if he wanted to avoid further damage to his health. He
did stop, and it made an impression that Layza, now 17, never forgot.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the first true sign that smoking was bad, if my father
stopped doing it," Lopez said.</LD>
<TE>   She has since become a warrior in the campaign to head off other
teens from developing an addiction to nicotine that can devastate
them later in life.</TE>
<TE>   She is a pest around her smoking friends, a blunt messenger of the
ways smoking is just so uncool. And she is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   In California, more than any other state, social pressure against
lighting up has filtered to young people. That, along with costs and
other factors, is driving smoking rates among teenagers to the lowest
levels on record.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, only 5.9% of youths 12 to 17 reported smoking a cigarette
in the previous 30 days, according to newly released data from the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   That compares to 11% in 1994, the first year such surveys were
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   California is leading a national trend that finds smoking rates
falling sharply among teenagers, after a rise during the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, 28% of high school students say they have smoked in
the last month, down from 36% in 1997, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute the decline to higher cigarette prices, removal
of Joe Camel-like tobacco advertising that appealed to young people
and creative anti-smoking campaigns that deglamorize the activity.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of young people like Layza Lopez are involved in
education programs designed by teens for teens.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids have come to see a number of drugs as dangerous in the last
several years; peer norms are changing," said Lloyd D. Johnston, a
principal investigator at the University of Michigan Institute of
Social Research, which recently produced a national survey charting
the decline in teen smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, during the time that Congress was considering tobacco
legislation, there was a great deal of exposure of what was going on
in the tobacco industry and kids saw themselves as being
manipulated."</TE>
<TE>   California has pioneered legislation limiting smoking in public
places, chilling the climate for smokers of all ages. More young
people in the state grow up in an environment that is far less
tolerant of secondhand smoke and in homes where nonsmoking parents do
not pass along the habit.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of youth smoking is generating intense interest. In an
effort to influence more youths, state Assemblyman Paul Koretz
(D-West Hollywood) recently introduced legislation to raise the legal
age for purchasing tobacco from 18 to 21, after such a move was
endorsed by the California Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge last week found that the R.J Reynolds
Co.--makers of brands such as Camel, Winston and Salem--had violated
the terms of the 1998 tobacco settlement prohibiting magazine ads
aimed at teens, and fined the company $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Researching Addiction</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that many youngsters are still too easily lured into
taking that first puff. And, compared to adults, they say, it is just
as hard, maybe harder, for teenagers to kick the habit.</TE>
<TE>   New medical research is finding that adolescents can develop
cravings after a few draws and become addicted within weeks.
According to a University of Massachusetts study, they are far more
likely than others to fail in efforts to quit. According to the
American Lung Assn., 67% of teens who smoke say they want to quit and
70% wish they had not started. Researchers are trying to find out if
physiology may play a role.</TE>
<TE>   Gevorg Kbulchyan, 17, and a senior at Los Angeles' Francisco Bravo
Medical Magnet High School, says he dreams of waking up one day and
not having cravings, of finishing a meal or a movie and not reaching
for a pack. At his peak, he would go through 25 to 30 cigarettes a
day, not thinking of eating.</TE>
<TE>   He's been caught on campus a few times, recently with a lighter,
and had to attend mandatory smoking education classes. If caught with
tobacco, students face suspension, transfer and even court fines.</TE>
<TE>   On a previous occasion, he had to watch a video of people with
diseased lungs hooked up to a breathing machine.</TE>
<TE>   Then he got a chest infection and an X-ray revealed that his own
lungs were affected.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor asked me if I smoked, but I wouldn't admit it in front
of my mom," Kbulchyan said.</TE>
<TE>   He made a resolution to cut back on nicotine, but he has not yet
won the battle. He started smoking when he was 14, influenced, he
said, by a family of smokers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something you're proud of," Kbulchyan said. "When you
start, you don't think it's going to affect you." He puckers his nose
and adds, "Sometimes I smell my jacket and think, 'How can people
stand me?' "</TE>
<TE>   On another day and in another room at Bravo, volunteers from the
Regional Youth Consulting Firm--a group sponsored by the Proposition
99-funded tobacco control organization L.A. LINK--are taking the
fight to its source, planning their own media campaign to counter
tobacco marketing.</TE>
<TE>   They're not happy with their Internet site, comparing it poorly to
the flashy Web site of tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson. "I thought
the whole point was to outdo big tobacco," one girl said.</TE>
<TE>   The youth group developed a series of radio and television ads
dubbed the Toxic Comedy Campaign and enlisted professional comedians
to help them make their point. Their commercials refer to the tobacco
companies by name and end with the tag line "You're killing us ...
(Really)." The spots, which have aired on radio and youth-oriented
cable stations such as MTV, BET and the Comedy Channel, have been
nominated for awards and this month will be presented to a Swedish
government delegation as a model.</TE>
<TE>   But the students now are concerned about whether their group can
survive. Fewer smokers means reduced revenues from Proposition 99
cigarette taxes to fund anti-smoking programs. In addition, Gov. Gray
Davis has proposed cutting $46 million from the state's tobacco
control budget.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we make a dent and let them know that we're out here,
we feel like we're achieving something," said Lopez, who has taken
her zeal to the point of boycotting Kraft food products because it is
owned by Philip Morris.</TE>
<TE>   The youths talk about talk about how easy it is for youngsters to
be seduced by images that appear grown-up and sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was smaller, my sister and I used to think the tobacco ads
were so cool; we would hold crayons and pretend we were smoking,"
said Evelyn Orellana, a 16-year-old Bravo sophomore who says she's
never smoked.</TE>
<TE>   In East Los Angeles, the students in Operation Store Front--an
elective peer education program--take their anti-tobacco case to
local convenience stores and service stations, asking managers to
pledge they will not sell cigarettes to anyone under 18.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, about 15 Roosevelt High School students
marched to confront managers at a nearby gas station that displayed a
large red-and-white Marlboro sign in the driveway and on the pumps
and a Kool sign at the checkout stand. Visible tobacco ads are
illegal within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds and other sites
that children frequent.</TE>
<TE>   The students handed the perplexed cashier a memo signed by all the
students seeking a meeting with the manager.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Susana Reynoso said some stores take down signs but tell
her that cigarette companies come and put them back up. Still, the
students have kept up the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the stores around the high school have taken down signs,
and they no longer sell cigarettes to minors," Reynoso said. "The
kids really enjoy what they're doing, and it's working. The stores
get nervous when they see us coming."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 46 states and major tobacco companies entered into an
agreement that restricts tobacco advertising and promotion and
requires companies to fund ads discouraging young people from
smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed Messages</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco makers contend they are doing their part to dissuade
children from smoking. Philip Morris, for example, created a separate
department devoted to youth smoking prevention that reports directly
to its chief executive. Howard Willard, senior vice president in the
department, said the company rigorously tests its ad campaigns with
focus groups of youngsters and parents to ensure they are getting
across the message. In addition, the company says it does not do
product placement in movies, is working with retail stores to reduce
the visibility of cigarettes and has reduced its magazine advertising
spending by 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The American Journal of Public Health devoted its entire June
issue to youth smoking and tobacco marketing. Studies cited in the
journal found that industry-produced advertisements to discourage
smoking--such as the Philip Morris "Think. Don't Smoke" campaign--are
not effective at reducing youth smoking.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, ads produced by anti-smoking groups, funded by the
tobacco settlements, were found to be far more effective.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, experts are troubled by the pull exerted on teens
when popular actors such as Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts light up on
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Although the movie industry has challenged the notion that such
exposure promotes smoking, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School in
a recent study concluded that children who viewed the most smoking
images in movies were more likely to have smoked.</TE>

<HD>Educators Laud Alternative to Stanford 9 Test</HD>
<DH>Schools: Capistrano teachers say exam linked to pupils'
skill level, not grade level, is key to growth, while state version
is too general.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the state's standardized testing program comes under mounting
criticism, a few school districts have been quietly using a separate
model that proponents praise as superior.</LD>
<LD>   In the Capistrano Unified School District, one of the first in the
state to administer the alternative test, educators say students have
raised academic achievement by a grade level in the six years since
the program was adopted.</LD>
<LD>   "It really is an accountability tool for us," said Austin Buffum,
deputy superintendent of education in the south Orange County school
district. "If you devise a system that focuses on growth, guess what?
Achievement grows."</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts
voted to look at alternatives to the controversial Stanford 9 test, a
major component of the Academic Performance Index. The annual index
ranks schools and determines who gets monetary awards based on gains.
Any such move would be largely symbolic; statewide standardized
testing is mandated under California law.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford 9, due to be replaced next year by a similar test,
has been criticized as discriminatory against poor and minority
students, many of whom attend overcrowded schools and speak little
English.</TE>
<TE>   Buffum said the test works as a general measuring device but is
too imprecise to be useful in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The district's test, given in addition to the Stanford 9, measures
similar basic skills such as reading, language and math.</TE>
<TE>   Like the state test, it compares the performance of local students
against a national average. But unlike the standardized test, the
Capistrano exam is tailored to a student's skill level, not the grade
level.</TE>
<TE>   So while all fourth-graders in California take the same Stanford 9
test, for example, students in Capistrano take tests that differ in
difficulty level, depending on their skills.</TE>
<TE>   If the Stanford 9 is a measuring stick that determines where most
students in a certain grade fall, the Capistrano tests are a set of
incremental rulers that pinpoint each student's growth throughout the
school year.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is crucial in providing a curriculum to students,
Capistrano officials said. The Stanford 9 mostly tells teachers
whether their students are average--seldom a revelation to school
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The yearly Stanford 9 results "are a foregone conclusion," said
Silvia Mazzeo Pule, principal at San Juan Elementary School in San
Juan Capistrano. The campus, where 86% of the students are still
learning English, ranks toward the bottom of the academic index. The
state test, Pule said, "doesn't guide instruction at all."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the district test is given three times a year to keep
tabs on what students know and what they need to learn.</TE>
<TE>   The district test is credited with increasing San Juan's
performance in the Stanford 9s. The school has met its growth targets
two years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not only low-performing students that benefit from the
targeted approach, Capistrano officials said. Students who score high
on the Stanford 9 should still have improvement goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot bask in the results" of Stanford 9, said Helene Dykes,
principal of Tijeras Creek Elementary School in Rancho Santa
Margarita, which ranks among the highest in the state's academic
index. "We are being rewarded for good demographics."</TE>
<TE>   Dykes' staff use the district test to determine what children are
ready to learn.</TE>
<TE>   For example, two years ago, 84 fifth-graders were ready to take
algebra lessons in the sixth grade. Last year, the number doubled to
169.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly represents a slice of what we are talking about,"
said Jeffrey Bristow, executive director of elementary instructional
services.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are teaching more precisely....It is much better than
throwing award money at it."</TE>
<TE>   The Capistrano test is based on a model developed by Portland,
Ore.-based Northwest Evaluation Assn., a nonprofit group formed in
the mid-1970s by school districts in search of better assessment
tools.</TE>
<TE>   The association keeps a databank of 40,000-plus test questions
that districts can choose from to design exams around their
curriculum and cultural sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a district in Southern California would probably not
choose an item that uses snow to pose a test question.</TE>
<TE>   More than 800 districts in 32 states, including 20 in California,
have used or use the test, according to the association, but to
varying degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano administers the exam from second through eighth grades.</TE>
<TE>   Alameda City Unified School District, the first to adopt the test
nearly a decade ago, gives the test only at low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives more information, better information, sooner," said
Donna Fletcher, Alameda's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Buffum said he agrees with the need for school accountability,
"but why not adopt a system that actually helps students learn?"</TE>

<HD>'Railway to the Clouds' Captured Southland's Imagination</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the decades known as the "Great Hiking Era," from the 1890s to the
1930s, a visionary and avid hiker built a "Railway to the
Clouds"--which for a time became Los Angeles' foremost amusement
ride.</LD>
<LD>   Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine Lowe and a partner conceived the
world's first electric-powered mountain railway, the Mt. Lowe Scenic
Railway above Altadena, which was considered one of the world's
greatest engineering feats of the 19th century.</LD>
<LD>   They carved out a wonderland of hotels, a zoo, an observatory, a
grand pavilion, a searchlight that played on the valley below and
trails in the San Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   The seven-mile railroad traversed steep mountain slopes and
transported millions of sightseers willing to pay as much as $5 each
round trip.</TE>
<TE>   For four decades, it was Southern California's leading tourist
attraction. But fire, a flood, an earthquake, a rockslide, the Great
Depression and the decline of rail transit led to its demise.</TE>
<TE>   The railway idea began in 1888 when Lowe, a gifted scientist and
devoted family man, moved from New Hampshire to Pasadena with
intentions of retiring at age 55.</TE>
<TE>   He built a 24,000-square-foot showplace on Orange Grove Boulevard,
where he dreamed and gazed longingly at the snow-capped peak of Mt.
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe had served the Union forces as a reconnaissance balloonist
for President Lincoln during the Civil War. Demonstrating the value
of the balloon, he took the first aerial photographs and pioneered
aerial mapping.</TE>
<TE>   Despite only a fourth-grade education, he made a fortune from
inventions and patents dealing with steel, hydrogen gas and
refrigeration. He also helped organize two banks.</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't Stop Inventing</TE>
<TE>   But retirement didn't come easily to an inventor who could not
stop inventing. Lowe hooked up with a civil engineer, David Joseph
Macpherson, who had been looking at the same mountain with an eye
toward constructing a railway.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they hiked the ridges and canyons and fished the
streams. Inspired by the beauty of this hikers' paradise, where
roaring waterfalls carved the cliffs of Rubio Canyon, both men
decided that other sightseers should experience it. Two Mt. Wilson
landowners who operated a toll road to rugged campgrounds refused to
give Lowe and Macpherson the right-of-way. Undeterred, the pair moved
their ambitions four miles east to Oak Mountain, later renamed Mt.
Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the majestic mountains proved more challenging than restful.
In 1891, with Lowe's imagination and money and Macpherson's
engineering skills, they began their project.</TE>
<TE>   A crew of 50 men blasted through rock with dynamite, dangling from
ropes over the cliff face to chip out holes for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   In less than two years, the railway spanned about three miles,
from the Altadena Junction on Lake Avenue to Echo Mountain. In two
more years, it reached the base of Mt. Lowe, nearly four more miles.</TE>
<TE>   The idea soon captured the imagination of Pasadena too: The peak
was officially renamed Mt. Lowe in December 1892.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, 1893, the Mt. Lowe Scenic Railway opened to music
played by the Pasadena City Band, which rode in the first cable car
from Rubio Canyon to Echo Mountain. Eerie echoes reverberated off the
canyon walls as the white railway car disappeared into a low bank of
clouds while the band played "Nearer My God to Thee."</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 white-knuckled passengers held on tight as the car
began its ascent from Altadena Junction, north through the poppy
fields and into Rubio Canyon. There, they disembarked to enjoy the
amenities at the Rubio Hotel and pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Guests danced in the moonlight and ventured up the sunlit canyon
on wooden walkways to marvel at the landscape and waterfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Others boarded two "airships," aptly named Echo and Rubio, on the
great cable incline for a breathtaking 3,000-foot ride up a 62% grade
to the Echo Mountain resort area.</TE>
<TE>   Atop Echo Mountain stood Lowe's "White City," so named because the
white electric lights of the hotel, zoo, power plant, observatory and
the world's largest searchlight could be seen as far away as Santa
Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   Miles of Hiking Trails</TE>
<TE>   Guests thrilled to the sound of their voices reverberating around
Echo Mountain, enhanced by a metal megaphone on a stand. Visitors
could enjoy the surrounding scenery on more than 30 miles of hiking
trails.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1895, Lowe completed the final 3 1/2 miles of the
railway to Crystal Springs, a forested cove at the base of Mt. Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   The line followed the natural contours of the mountainside over 18
trestles and 127 hairpin curves, including the Grand Circular Bridge
and Horseshow Curve, to the Ye Alpine Tavern, which was flanked by
cozy private bungalows.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors watched sunsets from Inspiration Point, where a number of
telescope-like sightseeing tubes pointed to spots in the valley
below. Others walked to a nearby farm where silver foxes were bred
for the fur market, or rode horses on the trails.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the railway line's success, it proved a financial drain.
Lowe spent $700,000 on the venture, and two years after its
completion, he had to mortgage all he owned--including his home, the
Pasadena Opera House and several gas companies throughout the
state--in a desperate attempt to remain solvent. Still, he lost
control of his empire, and died in obscurity in Pasadena in 1913 at
age 81.</TE>
<TE>   After the turn of the century, Henry E. Huntington, builder of the
vast Southern California Pacific Electric railway network, bought the
Mt. Lowe railway and linked it to his trolley line.</TE>
<TE>   The Echo Mountain hotel was already gone, destroyed in 1900 by an
electrical fire caused by a defective stove vent. That was the first
of several disasters to befall the project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1905, a violent windstorm and fire destroyed the trestles and
all the buildings on Echo Mountain except the observatory and
telescope, which would be badly damaged by the wind more than two
decades later.</TE>
<TE>   Deadly Rockslide</TE>
<TE>   A flood and rockslide in 1909 destroyed the Rubio Hotel and
pavilion, where caretaker and railroad agent Fred Drew was living
with his family. When a bolt of lightning struck the east wall of the
canyon, it sent a ton of rocks cascading down on the building.</TE>
<TE>   Drew and his wife were seriously injured but were able to save
their 5-year-old son, Thayer, only to see him crushed to death as he
ran back to rescue his dog. The boy's body was found clutching its
remains.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel and pavilion were replaced with a car barn.</TE>
<TE>   The railway's demise began in 1936, when a fire gutted 13 cottages
and the Ye Alpine Tavern (by then renamed Mt. Lowe Tavern). Two years
later, heavy rainstorms took out most of the railway tracks.</TE>
<TE>   During its 43 years, the narrow-gauge railway attracted tourists
from around the world and carried 3.1 million passengers without a
single accident. As many as 1,500 people made the trip in a day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the railway site was listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. Mt. Lowe enthusiasts have published books, collected
memorabilia, cleared trails and rebuilt a shelter at Inspiration
Point to ensure that the memories and rich stories associated with
Lowe and his railroad will endure.</TE>

<HD>Tijuana's Advocate for Change Brings Hope to a Restive City</HD>
<DH>Border: Civic planning chief aims to transform sprawling
metropolis with modest initial projects followed by greater ones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Carlos Graizbord used to shield his eyes when he drove by the dusty
squatter settlements clinging precariously to the hillsides of this
border city.</LD>
<LD>   The dirt roads, the makeshift homes pieced together out of tires
and plywood, the chaotic jumble of neighborhoods that sprouted of
their own accord--all of it was too much.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just the immense poverty that depressed him. It was that
fixing the untamed colonias was up to him. As the new director of
Tijuana's Institute for Municipal Planning, Graizbord had to find a
way to bring order to one of North America's most unruly cities.</LD>
<TE>   Three years later, the illegal shantytowns are still there, but
the determined planning director no longer averts his gaze. His short
tenure so far has given him hope that transforming this sprawling
metropolis--in ways both small and large--is indeed possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no bigger challenge," he said. "Maybe Calcutta. But I do
believe that if we persist with our effort, we can change the city,
slowly."</TE>
<TE>   For evidence, he looks to Avenida Revolucion, the mostly seedy
downtown strip of bars and clubs that is slowly taking on the
appearance of a pleasant pedestrian promenade.</TE>
<TE>   After the city began planting rows of neatly trimmed shrubs,
widening the sidewalks and installing benches, the local merchants
began cleaning up the facades of their shops.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Graizbord dreams of rehabilitating the Alamar River, a
polluted waterway that cuts through the northeast of the city, into a
vibrant 7-mile greenbelt with gardens, recreation and housing. And he
hopes to make the poor colonias that have cropped up all over the
city into orderly villages with paved roads, running water and
community centers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot to expect in a place where a third of the city lacks
basic services like sewage lines, where half the new homes go up
unapproved, where officials worry about running out of water in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   But Graizbord, a Harvard-educated urban planner who has worked for
the cities of Riverside and San Diego, said he now believes that
small initial achievements can be followed by greater ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not quixotic and naive," he insisted. "This is extremely
complicated and difficult, but it's possible."</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana officials and urban planners on both sides of the border
praise Graizbord for bringing badly needed optimism and vision to a
restive city.</TE>
<TE>   But high hopes alone cannot overcome unpredictable politics, a
sluggish bureaucracy and a sheer lack of money.</TE>
<TE>   The planning institute gets by on a $1-million annual budget, just
enough to pay the salaries of its 40 architects, engineers and urban
planners.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, Graizbord has to try to raise money from the
private sector to bring his plans to fruition, such as a statue
commemorating local teachers.</TE>
<TE>   He's also managed to launch the streetscape project along Avenida
Revolucion and add traffic improvements to a busy intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know when he will be able to realize his dreams for the
city," said Jose Luis Castro, director of the urban planning
department at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana. "I think
the attitude of Carlos is a good one. There has to be optimism about
bettering the city."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana began as an arid border outpost in 1889, but only truly
began to grow after World War II. The city's population has about
doubled every decade since then, fueled by migrants seeking work in
the United States or in the city's foreign-owned maquiladora
manufacturing plants.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana is now a city of more than 1.2 million--the exact figure
is difficult to ascertain because of the number of illegal
settlements and migrants passing through. With growth at twice the
national average, the city population is projected to reach 2.5
million by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, city officials are trying to figure out how to
manage that growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Planning is a concept that in Mexico and Tijuana has not been
very present," said Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the City Council established the Institute for
Municipal Planning as a quasi-independent agency, designed to free
planning from the wild swings of Mexican politics.</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord, 58, was chosen as its first director.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Guadalajara, he studied architecture at the National
University in Mexico City, and then urban and regional planning at
Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. He was doing long-range
planing for the city of San Diego when the job opened up in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "I do love difficult things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Every day he makes the commute from his manicured San Diego
neighborhood of Scripps Ranch to the sparse two-story offices of the
institute, located on a frenetic Tijuana avenue. (He said he has
remained in San Diego because his wife works there.)</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord's shirt pocket is always stuffed with half a dozen pens
and pencils, which he frequently yanks out to illustrate an idea for
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Carmen, says ruefully that he regularly springs out of
bed at 6 a.m. on the weekends and rushes to the computer to e-mail
his staff a new idea.</TE>
<TE>   But he loses sleep too--about last year's severe budget cuts and
the fear that a new city administration might not be as supportive of
long-range planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I'm in an optimistic mood," he told a visitor with a grin
on a recent afternoon, his thick glasses perched on his forehead.
"Next time you come by, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord's efforts so far have earned him kudos from city leaders
anxious to show investors and tourists a remade Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "He has worked very hard against the odds, breaking the
bureaucracy of the government to achieve these projects," said Jose
Galicot, owner of a telecommunications company and president of a new
organization working to improve the city's image. "There are many
people in Tijuana who talk and don't do a thing. Graizbord is a
thinker and a doer."</TE>
<TE>   But getting things done is not always easy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a recent spring afternoon, Graizbord navigated the jumble of
unmarked streets that make up Tijuana's downtown, pointing out the
peeling billboards, the heavy electrical wires sagging in front of
windows and the cacophony of signs that leap out from record shops,
bars, souvenir emporiums and cheap motels.</TE>
<TE>   "You see all that mess?" he said, exasperated. "Let's clean up the
signs, put the electrical wires underground and add trees. Just
beautifying it will have a big effect."</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord believes that simple steps like these will act as
"detonators," slowly altering the way people perceive the city and
their investment in it.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of Avenida Revolucion, he pointed with pride to the
rows of neat shrubs that line a few blocks of the street.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Graizbord hopes to extend the streetscape project down
the length of the downtown avenue to the international border and,
one day, to a pedestrian walkway that would link to a shopping mall
north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Avenida Revolucion dead-ends at the corrugated metal
fence.</TE>
<TE>   But Graizbord hopes that the modest beginnings on the avenue
eventually will lead to grander transformations.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to fight against the backlog," he said. "We
won't rehabilitate the entire city. But we can make it a better place
to live."</TE>
<TE>   If city officials have any complaints about Graizbord, it's that
they want him to get a long-range plan for the city done faster. They
are convinced that any hope of controlling the area's growth lies in
targeting new development.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two Tijuanas," said Manuel Guevara, the city's
secretary for urban growth. "The one already built, where our parents
and grandparents live, and the second Tijuana, the one that will be
built in the next 20 years. We need to build that one better."</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord said he understands those pressures, but he's worried
that some city leaders are unrealistic about the pace of change.</TE>
<TE>   "People can't expect quick results," he said. "This isn't a
tanning bed."</TE>
<TE>   Over on Tijuana's east side, Graizbord wants to launch a
$5-million pilot project to demonstrate how the city's impoverished
neighborhoods can be improved. About 5,000 people now live in
ramshackle houses that make up the hillside colonia called 10 de
Mayo. Graizbord's staff, with the help of planners from UC San Diego,
have outlined a project that includes paving the streets, installing
water and sewage lines and rehabilitating a dry and trash-laden creek
bed into a lush neighborhood park.</TE>
<TE>   The institute has approached the nearby maquiladoras, which employ
many of the residents, to invest in the project. So far, one company
has agreed to consider the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Graizbord hopes to connect the 10 de Mayo park to a larger
ecological preserve along the Alamar River, a tributary of the
Tijuana River that frequently floods during heavy rains.</TE>
<TE>   He envisions building riverfront parks and housing, and even a
botanical garden showcasing various flora from around Mexico--plans
that evoke American environmentalists' hopes for resurrecting the Los
Angeles River. The price tag for the Mexican project: around $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   The planning institute does "excellent work, really first-rate,"
said Keith Pezzoli, a professor of urban planning at UC San Diego,
who is working with Graizbord on the 10 de Mayo project.</TE>
<TE>   "But building plans is one thing. Implementing them is another.
Where is the money going to come from?"</TE>
<TE>   The lack of money is also evident in the shortage of
code-enforcement officers--100, or about a third the number needed to
rein in illegal construction.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of oversight was evident during a recent drive around the
city. Graizbord passed a truck depot next to the Alamar River, where
a dozen large vehicles idled, disgorging thick clouds of black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we're going to do with this," he said with a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, a tractor cleared mounds of dirt from the side
of a hill that appeared sliced in half--a site of new housing
development.</TE>
<TE>   "That's illegal," he said, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   Then Graizbord suddenly brightened.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the wonderful thing," he said. "There's always something
to do. If you worked in Paris, there would be nothing left to do."</TE>

<HD>Tustin Trendy? Census Proves It</HD>
<DH>Population: Once rural, then suburban, city brings census
figures to life. Population is not only growing, but shifting by
income, class.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeanne and Earl Brown moved into a single-story house in a new
subdivision near Tustin in 1957, intending to leave Santa Ana's
growing bustle for a quiet spot amid orange groves that seeped
perfume when the trees were in bloom.</LD>
<LD>   It was country then, as rural as a Merle Haggard song, with starry
skies at night and air that smelled of farm instead of freeway.</LD>
<LD>   That's all gone. The Browns didn't know it, but they were the
leading edge of a wave of suburbanization that has forever altered
Orange County and other formerly rural areas that surround Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Now the Browns are witnessing another metamorphosis: The
urbanization of suburbia, as the quiet neighborhoods that replaced
orange groves fill ever more densely with young--and often
immigrant--families.</TE>
<TE>   "People who live here now don't remember when it wasn't like
this," Jeanne Brown, 78, said as she sat at a heavy oak table in the
Tustin Area Historical Society Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the changes," she said, "but you can't tell anybody
what it was like before, with nothing but orange groves from here to
Santa Ana."</TE>
<TE>   The Census Bureau has released 2000 data tracing the shifting
human tide in Southern California. The most striking change since
1990 has been the massive flow of classes and cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Middle-class families moved inland in search of cheaper housing,
leaving older urban core neighborhoods to new immigrants and the very
poor, and the coastal regions and hillside developments to the
well-to-do.</TE>
<TE>   Although the changes are widespread, few places embody these
shifts more than Tustin, which in the '90s underwent a profound shift
from predominately white, middle-class suburbia to something more
like the rest of the broad sweep of Los Angeles--a dense polyglot mix
of class and cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the changes that occurred in different parts of Southern
California converged here. The population grew, but faster at the
high and low ends of the economic scale. And ethnic diversity
continued to increase, leaving English-speaking whites a minority in
large swaths of the regions.</TE>
<TE>   As Tustin's population grew by a third, to 67,504, the number of
white residents fell from 32,136 to 30,264, dropping them to minority
status. Most of Tustin's new residents are Latinos, whose numbers
have more than doubled to 23,110--and Asians, with a population of
10,194.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the number of Tustin residents with bachelor's
degrees or more increased. So did those who never finished high
school. Median family income grew 7.5% to $60,092, propelled
primarily by gains among the wealthy--families earning more than
$150,000 nearly quadrupled to 1,581. Yet, the number of families
living in poverty spiked from 532 to 939, or 76.5%.</TE>
<TE>   But like most places, Tustin's history--and its changes--extend
far beyond 1990, the benchmark against which most of the 2000 census
results are measured.</TE>
<TE>   It encompasses two histories, actually--the past of the place
itself, and the lives of its people.</TE>
<TE>   A half-century ago, before the nation tilted to the Southwest and
people tumbled toward California, 1,143 people lived in Tustin--70%
of whom were considered rural residents, according to the 1950
census. Only 41 were foreign-born, compared with the 22,521
foreign-born residents counted in the 2000 census. Two residents in
1950 were black; four others were listed as "other races." Latinos
were not counted separately, though with only 41 foreign-born
residents, the Latino population was probably minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   Pat McCoy remembers. He runs McCoy Sheet Metal, where nine workers
turn out customized copper roof pieces and other architectural
details for million-dollar homes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from the business his grandfather started in 1928
in a small, wood-frame building on the south side of Tustin's Main
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the customers arrived on horseback and were looking, mainly,
for metal irrigation systems for their farms and orchards.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy, born in 1940, grew up in the business, sweeping out the
shop when he was 12, then working on the floor to learn the trade. He
took over from his father in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember working summers in high school, watching people go up
and down the street on horseback," said McCoy. "When I first started
working here, there were five or six [citrus] packing houses within a
mile of each other. Every one of them is gone."</TE>
<TE>   There have been other, more subtle changes. He hears more
languages spoken on the street, and sees fewer middle-class families
in Tustin neighborhoods. It's reflected in his own work force.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy sees the biggest change in Tustin's demeanor. The sleepy
village of his youth has been consumed by the megalopolis of Los
Angeles, with little open space left. Housing developments stand
where orange groves once dominated.</TE>
<TE>   As Tustin has evolved into suburbia, it has lost something, some
longtime residents say.</TE>
<TE>   Main Street is still a core area of small businesses, such as
antique shops and restaurants, but they are interspersed with vacant
lots where buildings once stood. City officials are proposing a
$2.2-million renovation of what they call "Old Town," hoping to give
it a cachet similar to the Orange's picturesque--and
thriving--historic downtown. Some older residents applaud the effort,
but are guarded about the chances of success.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the new main drag is Newport Avenue, an artery
perpendicular to Main Street that lies a few blocks to the east,
where strip malls are filled with such familiar names as Diedrich
Coffee and Office Depot, as well as locally owned restaurants and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in Tustin are most pronounced in neighborhoods south
of the Santa Ana Freeway, an area bounded on the west by the Costa
Mesa Freeway and the city of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Jhonatan Hinojosa, 22, his wife and their 2-year-old son moved
into a one-bedroom apartment here last year after spending about four
years living with his sister in the same complex.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa is the wave of the future, as counted in the 2000 census.
A native of Mexico, he quit school to work in Mexico City, then moved
to the United States in 1995 at age 15.</TE>
<TE>   After a short stay in Oxnard, he moved in with the sister in
Tustin in 1995. After working for a time as a gardener, he landed an
$18-an-hour job in construction.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa said gangs have begun to form in the dense neighborhoods.
But with more frequent police patrols, he's confident crime won't
become a problem. His rent recently jumped from $700 to $925 a month,
and although some neighbors are looking for a cheaper place to live,
he's staying put.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he wants to raise his family, eventually in their
own home.</TE>
<TE>   On Copperfield Drive, a few blocks east of Hinojosa's apartment,
Ed Eloe, 62, has seen Tustin's changes firsthand. He and his wife
moved here in 1976 to raise their three children while he served as a
Marine pilot and then as a systems engineer for Raytheon, working on
flight simulators and similar devices before retiring four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the Eloes moved in, the subdivision of one- and two-story
homes was 5 years old. Most of the original white owners have given
way to a range of ethnicities. "I see a man from India walking
around, but I don't know where he lives," Eloe said, taking a break
from trimming roses in his immaculate front yard. "Tustin is getting
more and more diverse, especially this side of the 5--it's getting
very international."</TE>
<TE>   The only aspect he dislikes is the congestion. Getting anywhere is
difficult. He and his wife have talked for two decades about moving.
Then he remembers things like the small orange grove that still backs
up to his yard, where blossoms fill the air with sweetness as Eloe
tends to his own plants.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we're still here," Eloe said.</TE>

<TE>   His father and grandfather hired from the local labor pool of
mostly white men; McCoy's staff now includes two Mexican Americans,
an African American and a woman--unusual in the male-dominated
metalworking industry. Nearly all of them commute from the Inland
Empire, priced out of the housing market in the county in which they
make their living.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy sees those shifts as part of an evolution that picked up
pace in the '60s and '70s, reaching sprint speed in the building boom
of the '80s before settling back during the recessionary '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball started rolling and it hasn't stopped," McCoy said.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy sees the biggest change in Tustin's demeanor. The sleepy
village of his youth has been consumed by the megalopolis of Los

<TE>   The pace of life in Tustin agrees with Hinojosa, who prefers it to
Oxnard or Santa Ana, which he said were more crowded and had more
crime. Two of his siblings also live in the apartment complex;
together they have seven children--a knot of cousins to grow up
together.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa said gangs have begun to form in the dense neighborhoods.
But with more frequent police patrols, he's confident crime won't
become a problem. His rent recently jumped from $700 to $925 a month,
and although some neighbors are looking for a cheaper place to live
he's staying put.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he wants to raise his family, eventually in their
own home.</TE>
<TE>   "I would first try to buy in Tustin," Hinojosa said. "If not, I
would try Irvine, but I will buy in this county. I have no interest
in moving anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   On Copperfield Drive, a few blocks east of Hinojosa's apartment,
Ed Eloe, 62, has seen Tustin's changes first-hand. He and his wife
moved here in 1976 to raise their three children while he served as a
Marine pilot and then as a systems engineer for Raytheon, working on
flight simulators and similar devices before retiring four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the Eloes moved in, the subdivision of one- and two-story
homes was 5 years old. Most of the original white owners have given
way to a range of ethnicities.</TE>
<TE>   One German and two Vietnamese live on Eloe's street; several
Latino families have moved into houses farther into the development.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a man from India walking around, but I don't know where he
lives," Eloe said, taking a break from trimming roses in his
immaculate frontyard. "Tustin is getting more and more diverse,
especially this side of the 5--it's getting very international."</TE>
<TE>   The only aspect he dislikes is the congestion. Getting anywhere on
roads clogged by traffic is difficult. He and his wife have talked
for two decades about moving.</TE>
<TE>   Then he remembers things like the small orange grove that still
backs up to his yard, where blossoms fill the air with sweetness as
Eloe tends to his own plants.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we're still here," Eloe says.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed, 6 Hurt in Head-On Collision</HD>
<DH>Accident: Minivan crashes into a station wagon near
Camarillo Airport. A Los Angeles couple and their four children
suffer injuries.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people were killed and six members of a family were injured when
a minivan collided head-on with a station wagon Saturday afternoon
near Camarillo Airport, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The crash occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on 5th Street, just east
of Pleasant Valley Road, the Ventura County Fire Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Two unidentified men in the Subaru station wagon died at the
scene. They were described as being in their 30s.</LD>
<TE>   "We were just scrambling to try and make sense of this chaotic
mess," said county Fire Capt. David Kromka. "There were lots of
people, passersby, who were trying to help and ... so many injured."</TE>
<TE>   At the scene, firefighters found four children--two boys and two
girls, ranging in age from 9 months to 9 years--lying outside the
Chevy minivan with bruises, cuts and broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   Several passing drivers apparently spotted the crash and stopped
to assist the injured, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The children were taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard and to Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo. Fire officials
said their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters had to use tools to extricate the children's parents,
who were trapped in the front seats of the minivan. The two adults
were flown to Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The names and conditions of the family members, who were from Los
Angeles, were not immediately available. The parents' injuries were
described as critical.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the crash left the blue minivan on its side and the
white station wagon crumpled.</TE>
<TE>   Police said it appeared that the minivan had crossed double yellow
lines into the path of the station wagon. No drugs or alcohol appear
to be involved.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Winery Presses On</HD>
<DH>Business: Daughter of Old Creek Ranch vintners and husband
are reopening tasting room on weekends and reviving the vineyard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winemaking flows through Carmel Whitman's veins.</LD>
<LD>   Her great-grandmother was an Italian immigrant who squeezed her
own red wine in the basement of her Detroit home. And for more than a
decade, her mother, Carmel Maitland, owned and operated the Old Creek
Ranch Winery on an 800-acre cattle ranch at the southern edge of the
Ojai Valley.</LD>
<LD>   So when the winery was shutting down two years ago, torpedoed in
part by a voracious pest that had ravaged its vineyard, she just
couldn't bear to see it end.</LD>
<TE>   "It was Mom's dream to make a success of this," said Whitman, who
along with her husband, John, has resurrected the winery and plans to
reopen it June 29. "We didn't want to let that fade away."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just about keeping Maitland's dream alive, it's also
about tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Old Creek, which released its first vintage in 1981, had become an
institution in the Ojai Valley. It was rooted in winemaking
traditions dating to the late 1800s, when early settlers built a
winery on the property that outlasted Prohibition and didn't shut its
tap until sometime during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the foundation remnants and broken walls of that building
stand today, a stone's throw from Old Creek's tasting room.</TE>
<TE>   John K. "Mike" and Carmel Maitland bought the ranch in 1976 and
launched their winery a few years later. When her husband was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease a few years later, Carmel Maitland
almost single-handedly ran the ranch and winery, while caring for him
until his death in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In that time, and until her death in 1996, Maitland made good wine
and better friends.</TE>
<TE>   She created a place that would become a landmark for locals and a
destination for wine drinkers from all over, loyalists who would line
her tasting room or pack a lunch and sit on the deck overlooking the
sun-bleached property.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard from a number of people who were sad the winery had gone
away," said John Whitman, who, when he's not producing wine, produces
television shows in Los Angeles. "In the end, we didn't want to see
it [stay] shut down. We wanted it to continue, for the tradition of
the ranch and in memory of my in-laws."</TE>
<TE>   The Whitmans aren't new to this.</TE>
<TE>   When Maitland died at age 74, she left the ranch and winery to her
son, Mark, and daughter, Carmel. The siblings and their spouses took
over the winery operation, launching a learn-as-you-go crash course
in winemaking and vineyard management.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a radical change," John Whitman said. "I tell people, 'One
day I was buying grapes by the pound, the next day I was buying them
by the ton.' "</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture worked well until early 2000, when it became
apparent that Old Creek would lose its vineyard to Pierce's disease.
Spread by a bug known as the sharpshooter, the disease has devastated
wine grapes throughout the state and by 2000 had wiped out most of
Old Creek's 20-acre vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Maitland wanted out of the business and the Whitmans
considered following suit. But by the summer of 2000 they committed
to buying him out and giving the winery another go.</TE>
<TE>   They took over sole ownership in October and, for the first time
since closing the winery in August 2000, will open it on Saturdays
and Sundays for tasting and sales.</TE>
<TE>   The winery will offer its first vintage produced under new
ownership, a 2001 Chardonnay. It also will sell a 1999 Merlot and
1999 Cabernet Sauvignon produced under the previous ownership
structure.</TE>
<TE>   When it sells out of the 350 cases it has available, the winery
tasting room will close until June of next year, when it will reopen
with an estimated 450 cases. By June 2004, the Whitmans plan to have
1,000 cases for sale, allowing them to remain open year-round.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to stay small, at 1,000 cases a year," John Whitman
said. "What we can do at 1,000 cases is make a good wine and have
lots of fun doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Like most other wineries in Ventura County, Old Creek is having to
rely on wine grapes bought from other parts of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Setting up in strip malls and industrial parks, local wine
producers have managed to carve a niche in California's competitive
wine industry, squeezing out superior vintages in a county better
known for its lemons and strawberries than its Syrahs and Sauvignon
Blancs.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural officials say there are fewer than 30 acres of wine
grapes in Ventura County, as local growing conditions are better
suited to producing more profitable fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the emergence of the disease-spreading sharpshooter has
made growers shy away from the idea even more.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitmans are undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   Although the last of Old Creek's vineyard, just 2 1/2 acres now,
is drying and shriveling, they talk of staking a new vineyard high
atop a grassy hill with brilliant views of the Ojai Valley and the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they are excited to be reopening and
reestablishing the winemaking operation.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother made a lot of friends over the years, and we inherited
many of them," Carmel Whitman said. "The first vintage was 1981, and
a lot of these people have been coming from the beginning, so they
are thrilled that tradition can continue."</TE>

<AU>TOD BROWN</AU>
<BD>Bishop Tod Brown is head of the Diocese of Orange.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bishops from throughout the United States will meet in Dallas on
Thursday through Saturday to officially come to grips with one of the
most tragic and daunting crises ever to occur in the Roman Catholic
Church in America. It will be our job to formulate a comprehensive
policy for dealing with priests who are guilty of sexual misconduct
with minors.</LD>
<LD>   As we prepare to convene, we are filled with great individual
sadness and collective contrition for the violence done to so many
young lives and the innocence lost as a result of the actions of men
under our supervision. We are determined to do all we can in our
capacity as shepherds to make sure the church is, always and
everywhere, a safe place.</LD>
<LD>   I believe the draft charter on sexual misconduct that was released
last week is a good first step toward establishing a strong national
policy. I am hoping that in our discussions, the policy will be
strengthened.</LD>
<TE>   I would like the national policy to be similar to the policy we
have adopted in Orange County, and I hope to see a strict auditing
component to ensure compliance and consequences for noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, I am confident that the bishops of the United States
will come away from their meeting with an official policy that is
just, fair, workable and unambiguous. We owe America's
Catholics--indeed, all Americans--nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, I want to assure the people of the Diocese of Orange,
and all citizens of Orange County, that the strict policy the diocese
currently has in place for dealing with cases of sexual misconduct
with minors will remain in force--no matter what provisions are
offered at the Dallas meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The policy of the diocese is this: no priest, or any employee of
the diocese, who is guilty of sexual misconduct with minors will be
allowed to remain in active ministry or church employment.</TE>
<TE>   This policy already has resulted in the removal of some priests in
this diocese.</TE>
<TE>   This same policy has been adopted by many dioceses in the United
States and has come to be known as zero tolerance. However, it
represents much more than a punitive measure. It is the first step in
what can be true healing for our distraught and angry people, and a
true rebirth for the Catholic church in America. But much more must
be done. We must listen and acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   The church is not only cardinals, bishops and priests, but the
entire people of God. And many of these people have been violated,
either through direct action or through the resulting blow to their
trust. Their pain has to be taken on as our pain, their outrage our
outrage.</TE>
<TE>   We must be willing to hear, and act on, the hard, unflinching,
uncomfortable truth. Above all, we must continue to seek the
forgiveness of the victims of abuse and do everything in our power to
help them heal. It will not be easy. But it must be done.</TE>
<TE>   As a local church, we have promised to be an institution that is
transparent, ever aware that trust is not built by harboring secrets,
by withholding pertinent information or by attempting to deflect
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The church is, or should be, all about loving pastoral care, about
becoming a true imitation of Christ. Only by being forthcoming can
the church truly open its arms to all victims of abuse and to the
alienated.</TE>
<TE>   The church's framework is to be one of fairness. When claims of
abuse are made, they will be thoroughly examined. It is our
responsibility to strive to be the servants of truth, for while we
must be swift and decisive in dealing with all legitimate charges, we
also must acknowledge that to accuse is not necessarily to condemn.
We exist under the rule of both church and civil law.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic church is at a critical crossroads. I have no doubt
that the church will weather the crisis, but the faithful cannot help
but wonder in these grim days what the church will look like when it
finally emerges on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   It is quite clear to me, and to many of my brother bishops, that a
return to the pre-scandal status quo is simply unacceptable. We--all
Catholics--have a priceless opportunity, even in the midst of this
sad period in our history, to take the stinging lessons that we have
learned and to make the church what it was always meant to be: a
place of truth, love, trust and holiness.</TE>
<TE>   By becoming a more open, receptive, vigilant, collegial and
pastoral church, we will once again reaffirm the spirit and promise
of Vatican II and the legacy of Pope John XXIII, who made it his aim
to throw open the windows of the church and fill it with the fresh
air of open discourse, broad cooperation, pastoral responsiveness and
a strong and active faith.</TE>

<HD>Governor's Race Trip Back in Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. PITNEY JR.</AU>
<BD>John J. Pitney Jr. is professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College and author of "The Art of Political
Warfare."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some commentators have likened the current California gubernatorial
race to the 1966 contest. Like Gov. Gray Davis, Pat Brown tried to
ensure he'd face a weak challenger by undercutting his supposedly
stronger rival in the GOP primary. Bill Simon's supporters take heart
from this comparison, since the weak Republican was Ronald Reagan.</LD>
<LD>   This comparison has problems. California was much more Republican
in those days, and Simon lacks Reagan's charisma and rhetorical
skill.</LD>
<LD>   Another analogy works better: the 1982 New York gubernatorial race
between Democratic Lt. Gov. Mario Cuomo and Republican businessman
Lew Lehrman. Like Davis, Cuomo was a tough-minded veteran of
statewide office. Like Simon, Lehrman was a wealthy think-tank
conservative. (If you go to a speech at the Heritage Foundation in
Washington, you are sitting in the Lehrman Auditorium.)</LD>
<TE>   Also like Simon, Lehrman had no experience in elected office and
shallow roots in the state he wanted to lead. Lehrman had come to New
York from Pennsylvania, just as Simon came to California from New
York.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, the think-tanker fought in a GOP primary against a
less-conservative Irishman with strong support from a major suburb.
Orange County's GOP activists generally backed former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan. Members of the moderate New Majority
organization wanted a like-minded candidate to lead the party.
Despite their issue differences, strong conservatives such as Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher also backed Riordan, thinking that he would have the
best shot at Davis.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1982 New York race, many moderate Republicans lined up
behind former U.S. Atty. Paul Curran, who also had the blessing of
the then-powerful Nassau County Republican machine. And yet in both
cases, the conservative insurgent beat the party moderates on their
own turf. Lehrman won Nassau County, and Simon won Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   What does the comparison tell us about the upcoming general
election? Both Davis and Simon can find hopeful signs.</TE>
<TE>   For the incumbent, the good news is obvious: Cuomo won in November
1982. He did unusually well in Nassau County, nearly erasing the
plurality that state Republicans needed to offset the Democratic edge
in New York City. Davis hopes to perform a similar feat in Orange
County, much as he did four years ago. And county Democrats should be
happy to learn that Cuomo's performance foreshadowed gains in the New
York GOP's onetime suburban stronghold. This year marked the first
time that Nassau County Democrats have held the county executive's
chair and a majority in the county legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Cuomo's 1982 victory came in the face of a massive
spending advantage by Lehrman. In the current race, Simon has little
chance of matching Davis' war chest, much less overwhelming it.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, the good news is that Lehrman scored as well as he did:
47.5% to Cuomo's 50.9%. This showing was remarkable because Lehrman
was running as a Reaganite in a liberal state during a bad year for
the GOP. In that recession election, the GOP lost dozens of House
seats.</TE>
<TE>   How did Lehrman come so close? His campaign spending helped a
great deal but was far from the whole story. As Californians Michael
Huffington and Al Checchi can attest, money alone does not decide
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrman's personal wealth, however, did benefit him. As with
Nelson Rockefeller before him, New Yorkers figured that he was too
rich to go on the take. Simon's fortune is reportedly not in their
league, but he has the opportunity to portray himself as unbought and
unbossed.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrman was less aggressive than Cuomo. Like Simon in 2002, he was
earnest to the point of dorky, but the contrast with his Democratic
opponent may have worked in his favor. Cuomo often came across as
mad-dog mean, especially in their first debate, where he mocked
Lehrman's gold wristwatch and dismissed his detailed issue statements
as "term papers."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has also shown a self-destructive streak of nastiness. In a
Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate 10 years ago, he ran
commercials comparing Dianne Feinstein to notorious tax cheat Leona
Helmsley. The ads backfired, helping elect Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Two differences between the 1982 and 2002 elections provide
glimmers of hope to Simon. First, the midterm climate is more
favorable to the GOP, with President Bush registering strong approval
in California. Second, whereas Cuomo's record was largely free of
ethical issues, Davis has faced harsh questions about his
fund-raising practices.</TE>
<TE>   Davis remains a heavy favorite, but the race could tighten. Both
sides may start looking for lessons in a race that took place a long
time ago in a state far, far away.</TE>

<LD>Ahmadou Toumani Toure, the former paratroop officer who overthrew a
dictator in Mali a decade ago, returned to power after an election
landslide in the impoverished West African country.</LD>
<LD>   Toure, 54, took office from President Alpha Oumar Konare, 56, who
stepped down after serving 10 years as allowed by the constitution.
That rule has come to be seen as a model of democracy in Africa.</LD>
<LD>   With the two men appearing to be on the best of terms, the
ceremony was a reversal of the inauguration in 1992 at which Toure
handed to Konare the reins of the landlocked former French colony.</LD>

<LD>Thousands of demonstrators, including Indonesian, Mexican and African
peasants, marched through Rome two days before an international food
summit, to demand new tactics in the war on hunger.</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization summit is
pushing the goal of halving world hunger by 2015. But protesters
accuse world leaders of putting trade above agriculture. "It is not a
problem of quantity of food, it's an economic and political problem,"
French farmer Jose Bove said.</LD>
<LD>   Genetically modified crops are expected to be one of the most
controversial summit issues. Crowd estimates varied from 10,000 to
40,000.</LD>

<HD>Bush Refuses to Set Mideast Timetable</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, says a target
date for statehood would give Palestinians hope and curb extremism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Saturday rejected an appeal from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to set a timetable of two to three
years to create a Palestinian state and conclude the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</LD>
<LD>   After talks Friday night and Saturday morning at Camp David, the
two leaders were at odds over a goal shared by key Arab allies to set
a target date for a final settlement. Giving Palestinians a sense of
hope, Mubarak reasons, would undermine extremists who have waged a
campaign of terror.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not ready to lay down a specific calendar, except for the
fact that we've got to get started quickly, soon, so that we can
seize the moment," Bush said at a joint news conference on a scenic
lane in the rural Maryland compound.</LD>
<TE>   In a series of meetings this spring with the leaders of Jordan,
Saudi Arabia, Morocco and now Egypt, the Bush administration has been
under growing pressure to provide a framework for peace and a date to
end the half-century-old conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world generally is anxious about an open-ended process
that could drag on indefinitely--and in turn fuel rather than defuse
Islamic extremism. In contrast, Israel wants a step-by-step approach
that doesn't offer any rewards until certain conditions, particularly
security, have been met.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Monday,
in one in a series of talks at the White House in advance of a
U.S.-orchestrated international Mideast conference, possibly in
Turkey this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak had proposed a deadline for Palestinian statehood in late
2004, after the U.S. presidential election, or early 2005, to
conclude the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   After their weekend talks, Mubarak again called for Washington to
come up with a vision that would bridge the serious divisions between
Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to a strong American engagement in the coming
phase to implement this vision," the Egyptian leader said.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak also has urged the administration to consider declaring a
Palestinian state before any final agreement on key obstacles, such
as the status of Jerusalem and the new state's final borders.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has repeatedly rebuffed that request. The president said
the United States is instead looking at how to go about launching a
"political dialogue" that could then pave the way for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Mubarak also disagreed sharply over Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. Bush again appeared to reject Egypt's
request that Arafat be given a chance to let his people be the
arbiter of his success in reforming the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak said that Egypt and the Arab world are working very hard
to push Arafat to take the critical steps, which include reining in
militants, eliminating corruption, introducing greater democracy and
accountability, and opening up what often appears to be a one-man
decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a chance would prove that he is going to deliver or not,"
Mubarak told reporters. "If he is going to deliver, I think everybody
would support him. If he is not going to deliver, his people will
tell him that."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush countered that Arafat has consistently disappointed the
United States and let down his people. "Therefore, my focus is on the
reforms necessary to help the Palestinians," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he wants to start immediately building the basic
institutions for the eventual emergence of a Palestinian state. That
initial step would give hope to Palestinians and signal to the wider
Mideast region and the outside world that coexistence and defeating
terrorism are possible, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "My view is that if the Palestinian people have a government that
is transparent and open and willing to serve the people, Israel will
be better off, Egypt will be better off, America will be better off,
and we're more likely to achieve peace," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also noted that there is "plenty of talent"
elsewhere among the Palestinians--a statement reflecting the growing
exasperation that Arafat, after repeated promises, has failed to stop
the bloodshed or begin restructuring his government.</TE>
<TE>   After a week that witnessed yet more attacks against Israelis,
Bush also bluntly called on Arafat to do everything in his power to
stop a wave of suicide bombings. "I mean everything," he repeated,
with clear annoyance in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States has worked longer with Egypt than any
other Arab country, the wide gap in positions was the strongest
undercurrent at this key session.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, speaking at length in Arabic, railed against Israel and
charged its government with assassination and "illegal confiscation"
of territory.</TE>
<TE>   To prove that Israel is a serious partner in peace, Mubarak said,
the Sharon government must end its army's crackdown on Palestinians
and pull back Israeli troops to positions occupied in September 2000,
when the current intifada against Israeli rule began.</TE>
<TE>   Israel should also end "assassinations and the repeated
incursions" into the Palestinian territories and halt all settlement
activities there, including the illegal confiscation of land, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Breaking Away From Herder Mentality</HD>
<DH>Africa: The tiny kingdom of Lesotho wants to bring boys off
the hills and into the classroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEYATEYANENG, Lesotho</DL>
<LD>Until Molefe Sejane got his first taste of proper school this year,
the 13-year-old's only classroom was the vast open plains far up in
the hills from his home. His self-taught "lessons" were repetitive:
the care and feeding of five sheep.</LD>
<LD>   But Molefe got lucky. The uncle who had raised him recognized that
the boy's future lay in counting sums, not sheep, and allowed him to
give up full-time herding for learning. Education has increased his
confidence and his ambition.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of other boys in this tiny mountain kingdom are less
fortunate. Grinding poverty in rural areas has forced families to
sacrifice their sons' education in favor of protecting their
livestock--in most cases here, a family's only source of wealth.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a serious problem," said Kimberly Gamble-Payne, the UNICEF
representative in Lesotho. "About 20% of the school-age boys are out
of school for one reason or another, and the most common cause is
herding."</TE>
<TE>   A cultural norm that has metamorphosed into an economic necessity,
the practice of making all boys shepherds has made Lesotho an anomaly
in Africa. Here, girls are given the opportunity over boys to attend
school, and women are in general more literate than men.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to protect children's rights to education, and to
redress the academic balance between the genders, the Lesotho
government has launched a full-court press to get boys educated. Free
elementary school education was introduced in 2000 through third
grade, and the government, which last month won a landslide victory
in general elections, plans to enforce compulsory primary schooling
for all children by next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody needs some form of learning. If you are not literate,
you are living in the shadow of other people," said Thakane Tsilo, a
informal education trainer with the Lesotho Distance Teaching Center,
a government-funded organization that teaches literacy to people
without access to a formal education. About 80% of the group's
students are "herd boys" who don't attend school.</TE>
<TE>   Boys as young as 6 are sent to the mountains to look after
livestock, including sheep, goats, cattle and donkeys. While some
boys shepherd during the day and return home in the evening, many
live away from home for months at a time in makeshift shelters that
form so-called cattle posts. Others are hired out by their family and
live lonely and precarious lives, looking after other people's
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Lesotho ranks among the poorest 50 nations in the world, according
to U.N. statistics. An economy based on subsistence agriculture means
that livestock defines a person's social status.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle are particularly held in esteem because they are used for
payment of marriage dowries. They're also slaughtered to mark
occasions such as births, deaths and weddings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to have a herd boy to take care of these precious
[animals]," said Pius Fako Masupha, chief of Ha Mamathe, a settlement
within Teyateyaneng where he estimates there are as many as 2,000
herd boys. "You will find a herd boy in each and every family that
has cattle."</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1880s and the discovery of diamonds and gold in South
Africa--which surrounds tiny Lesotho--herding was primarily a man's
job. But with the precious minerals came mines and an opportunity for
employment, and thousands of Lesotho men flocked to the pits. With
women and children left behind, it soon became the responsibility of
the boys of the household to tend the livestock.</TE>
<TE>   "Most who end up being herd boys are from poor families," said
Tsilo, the literacy trainer. "And if families are poor, they usually
hire out their boys."</TE>
<TE>   Some of them earn as little as $120 a year for herding--usually
never seeing a cent of that money themselves--and often live alone in
the mountains, braving the harsh, snowy winter elements and hunting
for food when their supplies from home run out. Sometimes they share
their dismal accommodation and scant supplies. None has access to
schooling, health care or other basic social services.</TE>
<TE>   "Some human rights groups have called [herding] a contemporary
form of slavery," Gamble-Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   And the dangers are vast. Cattle rustling has become a major
problem, literacy program officials said. The boys often become
targets of physical abuse by the attackers. Dozens have been killed
while on duty in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider herding one of the most hazardous forms of child
labor," Gamble-Payne said. "Unlike the old days, when stock theft was
done with bows and arrows and slingshots, now it's done with guns.
There's a lot of violence."</TE>
<TE>   The boys tend to herd from around age 6 to 15, when they go off to
circumcision school. This traditional male rite of passage, in which
the boys are also taught the responsibilities of manhood, lasts for a
couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   "After that they feel they have crossed over from being boys to
men," Tsilo said.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, it would then be off to the mines in South Africa,
but a massive retrenchment of mine jobs has meant that few young men
are left with any choice but to go back to herding.</TE>
<TE>   The physical and mental isolation they experience at cattle posts
often breeds unhealthy behavior and attitudes, sociologists here say.
Many are so introverted and traumatized by years of isolation, or of
living only among boys, they find it difficult to re-integrate into
society as young men when they finish herding.</TE>
<TE>   Their lack of schooling and etiquette often leads to social
discord.</TE>
<TE>   "The strain caused by the disparity between the literate and
employable woman and the disempowered man is creating a lot of
problems at home," Gamble-Payne said. "Violence against women has
increased exponentially."</TE>
<TE>   Lesotho is a patriarchal society, where a married woman still
needs her husband's signature to get a passport, or a loan.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to restore some of the herd boys' rights, the
government has established several learning posts throughout the
country's most far-flung regions. Here, community volunteers tutor
the boys in basic literacy, counting and other life skills. Other
tutors, typically older women, hold classes in their home compounds
for those boys lucky enough to return to their families each evening.</TE>
<TE>   Molefe had a year of such tutoring before he started school. Other
boys, who have never seen the inside of a proper classroom, just seek
to learn the basics.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to read and write for themselves so that they can apply
for any jobs if they are advertised," said Maau Lekopa, 72, a
volunteer tutor who holds evening classes in her living room.</TE>
<TE>   Many older men have been inspired by the eagerness of herd boys to
learn and have also started attending the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Tsoteng Khetheng joined Lekopa's classes last year when he was 52.
A herder all his life, he never attended school. Now he wants
desperately to learn to read and write.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will help me in many aspects of my life," said
Khetheng, who recently found work as a driver but has been unable to
pass the test for his license. "Education is more important than
herding."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest challenges is getting most people to believe
that, educators and government officials say. Rural people rely on
livestock to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the issue of making people appreciate the rights of
herd boys and sensitization to the conditions under which they are
working," said Itumeleng Kimane, a sociologist at the National
University of Lesotho. "People generally feel children are children.
They should be seen and not heard. So it's been difficult to change
people's perception toward child labor."</TE>
<TE>   Government plans to mandate primary education for all children is
one move to counter such feelings. Authorities are also investigating
the possibility of introducing organized commercial farming that
could offer some relief to children forced to do agricultural chores,
such as herding.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tlohang Sekhamane, Lesotho's government secretary:
"Subsistence farming will become less, in favor of commercial
farming. And when that happens, children will have no role in this."</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen-year-old Molefi Mopeli, who has looked after his family's
cattle since he was 8 but now divides his days between herding and
schooling, said he welcomed the opportunity to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "I like animals," he said. "But I love going to school more."</TE>

<HD>Late Inca Outpost Is Found in Peru</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Remote site might have been a home of rulers
and one of the civilization's last refuges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep in an inaccessible canyon in the remotest area of Peru, a
British-American team has discovered what appears to be one of the
last refuges of the Incas before their civilization was destroyed by
the Spanish in 1572.</LD>
<LD>   Tipped off to the site's location by a native mule handler, the
team hacked through dense forest with machetes for a week before
finally descending 6,000 feet into a gorge on the Yanama river and
encountering the jungle-shrouded city.</LD>
<LD>   The site, called Cota Coca, is the second Inca settlement whose
discovery has been announced in the last two months. In March, a
National Geographic Society team revealed the discovery of a
mountaintop settlement at Cerro Victoria. The new site is twice as
large, however, and much better preserved.</LD>
<TE>   Cota Coca, whose discovery was revealed Thursday by Britain's
Royal Geographical Society, might have served as one of the homes of
the Inca rulers from 1532, when Manco Inca led a rebellion against
the Spanish conquerors, until 1572, when the last Inca ruler, Tupac
Amaru, was executed.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been a key outpost in the guerrilla warfare
conducted against the Spanish during that period, said British
archeologist Hugh Thomson, a fellow of the royal society, who led the
expedition with American archeologist Gary Ziegler. "It would have
served as a jumping-off point from which they could have harassed the
Spanish traveling on the royal road between Cuzco and Lima," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the site was a "once-in-a-lifetime experience," Thomson
said. "With so much of the world discovered and mapped, it's
reassuring to feel that there are still places that we don't know
about."</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the most exciting thing I have ever found," said
Ziegler of Colorado, who finances his explorations by organizing
archeology-based tours to Peru. Both of the expedition leaders are
experienced Inca experts who have been working in Peru for at least
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Cota Coca is located at an altitude of about 6,000 feet near the
junction of the Yanama and Blanco rivers in the rugged Vilcabamba
region of eastern Peru, about 100 miles west of the Inca capital,
Cuzco. It is on an isolated bench, or mesa, about 1.5 miles long,
carved out by the Rio Yanama in its mad rush to join the Rio Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence from the site suggests that the Incas built a road
linking Cota Coca to the former capital of Choquiquirao, only a few
miles downriver. A road in the opposite direction led toward Vitcos,
a secondary Inca city.</TE>
<TE>   The Incas built an extensive network of such roads, as many as
24,000 miles' worth. The roads were up to 14 feet wide and, when
conditions permitted, were paved with flat, fitted stones and
retained by stone walls.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the road between Cota Coca and the two nearby cities was
washed away by the Yanama river, however, and what remains is hidden
by dense overgrowth.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason no one has ever found this site before is that it lies
at the bottom of a very deep valley," Thomson said. "The river has
eroded the valley wall so badly that the valley is no longer
passable--you can't go up and down the valley. The only way to get
there is to descend directly from the mountain above."</TE>
<TE>   The site "is sort of a missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle," he said.
"We knew there had to be roads leading into and out of this area, and
a road leading through to the Rio Apurimac. This ruin rather neatly
fitted the jigsaw. It's very much the missing piece."</TE>
<TE>   The team, which also included veteran British archeologist
Nicholas Asheshov and Australian explorer John Leivers, spent nearly
a week hacking away the brush from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Under the brush, they found more than 30 stone buildings,
including a 75-foot-long kallanka, or meeting house, grouped around a
central plaza. Outside the central area are more well-made
rectangular houses.</TE>
<TE>   Two large walled enclosures, each about 100 by 175 feet, might
have been pens for passing llama convoys.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important discovery because it is a sizable center of
good-quality, late-Inca masonry," said John Hemming, a former
director of the royal society.</TE>
<TE>   Before it served as a possible refuge for Manco Inca and his
followers, Cota Coca was probably a regional administrative center
and way station for high-ranking travelers, Thomson said. In general,
the layout is functional rather than ceremonial.</TE>
<TE>   Some buildings in the outlying sectors might have housed resident
administrators, record keepers, workers and servants living and
working at such an outpost, he added. The sizable number of closely
grouped round and oval structures might have been lodging for workers
and storehouses for corn and other commodities.</TE>
<TE>   "What was remarkable was that the site was completely unlooted
when we arrived," Thomson said. "That's very, very rare in Peru. We
could see on the surface that it was untouched. Normally, at a site
like this there are huge holes everywhere where the looters have
been."</TE>
<TE>   The team did not do any excavations to look for artifacts. "That
would have been irresponsible," Thomson said. The team did find a few
grinding stones on the surface and some pottery shards.</TE>
<TE>   "These things have to be done like a lightning strike--get in,
clear the site and map it," he said. Careful excavation will be left
to a future expedition, either by the team or others. For the moment,
the area is being protected by the government to prevent looting.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson noted that "few of the Inca settlements in the area have
been properly excavated. What is remarkable is how little we still
know about the Incas compared to most of the other ancient
civilizations, not only the Egyptians and the Greeks, but even the
Maya and the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of that is because they lacked writing, but it is also
because less work has been done on them. It feels to me as if we are
still on the cutting edge of making new discoveries about their
civilization." A report on the expedition is on the society's Web
site at www.rgs.org.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Next in Line to Attempt to Ease Tensions in South
Asia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld took the handoff Saturday from
Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of State, as America's
relay diplomacy to end the crisis between India and Pakistan appeared
to be yielding its first results.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld is due in South Asia within the next few days for the
latest phase of talks aimed at cooling tensions between the two
nuclear rivals. He lingered more than a day in Estonia to hear the
impressions of Armitage--who had stopped on his way home from the
region to confer with Rumsfeld.</LD>
<LD>   Officially, Rumsfeld was in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, to take
part in talks with Baltic and Nordic defense ministers. But it turned
into a convenient way station to pick up the latest information from
Armitage on progress in the U.S. effort to lower the danger of war
between India and Pakistan in their dispute over the Himalayan region
of Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   Armitage sounded slightly upbeat about the situation as he arrived
in Tallinn on Saturday. He said that India was considering returning
some of its recalled diplomats to Pakistan soon and that it might
also make unspecified "military gestures" to assuage fears of a war
breaking out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you couldn't say the crisis is over, but I think you
could say the tensions are down measurably," Armitage said in
Tallinn, according to the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage had met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Thursday and Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in New Delhi on Friday. The time of
Rumsfeld's arrival in South Asia hasn't been specified. He is
scheduled to leave Tallinn today but plans to stop over in the Middle
East to confer with U.S. allies there.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld refused to comment on the India-Pakistan situation,
deferring to Armitage: "Whatever he says, I agree with."</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan have come under intense diplomatic pressure to
step back from the precipice of war. In addition to Rumsfeld and
Armitage, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin tried to play peacemaker when they met with the Indian
and Pakistani leaders in Kazakhstan on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee has demanded that Pakistan end its support to militants
in that country who he says are responsible for cross-border
infiltrations and attacks in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir
and in India itself.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, however, insists that Pakistan doesn't support
terrorist groups and has been doing everything in its power to
prevent attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's stop in Estonia was considered a strong hint that the
three Baltic states--Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania--would be at the
head of the list when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meets in
November and decides on which countries to invite next to join the
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest opinion is that the enlargement should include a large
number of countries," Rumsfeld told reporters.</TE>

<HD>West Bank Couple Were Shot to Death on Their Doorstep</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Pregnant wife, soldier are latest victims of
Palestinian incursions into Israeli settlements.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARMEI TZUR, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Yael Sorek and her husband, Ayal, probably heard the gunfire from
within their drab trailer on the outskirts of this Jewish settlement
in the West Bank. Despite the dead-of-night darkness, they went to
the door, still in their pajamas.</LD>
<LD>   Two Palestinian intruders gunned them down, spraying their mobile
home with bullets. Seconds later, an Israeli army patrol roared onto
the scene. In a 10-minute gun battle, the soldiers killed one of the
Palestinians, and the other fled.</LD>
<LD>   One soldier was killed in addition to Yael, 24, who was in the
late stages of pregnancy, and Ayal, 23, an off-duty soldier from an
elite infantry unit. Two other settlers and five soldiers were
wounded.</LD>
<TE>   The attack at Karmei Tzur early Saturday was the latest in a
string of deadly raids on Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip carried out by Palestinians who want to eject Jews from
Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Soreks lived in one of 10 trailers scattered on a slope a good
200 yards from the fence that encases Karmei Tzur. Its establishment
is part of a plan to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
despite U.S. and other international calls for an end to the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the Israeli navy said it intercepted two armed
Palestinians swimming in the Mediterranean toward the Dugit
settlement in the Gaza Strip, killing at least one of them, and three
other Palestinians were killed in an explosion near another
settlement in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   And late Saturday, at least two Palestinian gunmen tried to
infiltrate the Yitzhar settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus.
At least one of them was killed, and four Israeli soldiers nearby
were wounded, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks came as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon prepared
to depart for meetings in Washington with President Bush. Sharon's
office condemned the attacks and, as is customary, blamed them on
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and his inability to
stop violence. Sharon is expected to try to persuade Bush to agree
with Israel's plans to remove Arafat from the regional equation.</TE>
<TE>   The cluster of trailers attacked early Saturday was placed outside
Karmei Tzur in February 2001, the army said, and was named for Shmuel
Gillis, a doctor from the settlement who was killed at that time in a
Palestinian ambush.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to secure these settlements, but it's not impossible,"
said Brig. Gen. Amos Ben-Avraham, the Israeli army division commander
for the region. "Sometimes we succeed, and sometimes we don't."</TE>
<TE>   The mobile homes were deserted Saturday at midday. The one where
the Soreks had lived was roped off with police tape. Blood was
splattered by the door on the wall of the trailer and on the patch of
pavement in front. Residents had used blankets and sheets, weighted
down by plastic canisters and wooden chairs, to try to cover the
blood. Because Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath, no one could clean up
until after nightfall, an army spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Also because of the Sabbath, no one from the staunchly religious
settlement would speak to reporters Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Avraham, the army commander, said two Palestinian assailants
apparently crossed a barren valley from the south and slipped into
the Karmei Tzur outskirts about 2:30 a.m. No fence protected the
trailers, and an army watchtower that guards them is staffed only
during the day.</TE>
<TE>   An army patrol did notice the intruders, however, and was rushing
toward them when they opened fire, Ben-Avraham said. One Palestinian
armed with an M-16 and a knife was apparently the one who killed the
Soreks, while the second assailant, armed with a Kalashnikov,
escaped. The gun battle lasted long enough for both Palestinians to
repeatedly change magazines, firing off more than 100 rounds,
Ben-Avraham said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Avraham said the Soreks must have come to the door when they
heard the gunfire. Their bodies were found at the doorway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One assailant escaped toward the Palestinian village of Halhul,
less than two miles to the south. The army imposed a curfew on Halhul
and was carrying out house-to-house searches.</TE>
<TE>   At the Soreks' mobile home, olive-colored laundry hung on the
clothesline. They were apparently a studious couple; their small
trailer was full of religious books. A tiny kitchen filled one end, a
small bed the other. A menorah sat on the microwave.</TE>
<TE>   Karmei Tzur, a collection of red-roofed houses established in
1984, sits amid Palestinian villages about four miles north of
Hebron. Flanked by vineyards, it is home to about 100 Jewish
families.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 150 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip have been frequent targets of Palestinian militants.
Palestinians--and many Israelis--want the settlements dismantled as
part of a comprehensive peace agreement. The settlements chop up
Palestinian land and make a territorially contiguous Palestinian
state impossible.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon, who has championed the settler movement for decades,
refuses to consider evacuating the settlements. Studies by Israeli
human rights organizations B'Tselem and Peace Now showed that about
three dozen settlements have been created in the 15 months since
Sharon took office.</TE>

<HD>One Afghan Woman's Determination Can't Be Veiled</HD>
<DH>Government: At this week's grand council, delegate
Lawangina Rahman will stress that the time has come for the female
voice to be heard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QALAI NAJARAN, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Hidden beneath her long blue burka, which billows in the wind as she
follows her father at a respectful distance, Lawangina Rahman is an
unlikely leader of a revolution.</LD>
<LD>   It is only when she lifts the veil and begins to talk about the
risks she is willing to take for freedom that you are struck by the
full strength of her courage.</LD>
<LD>   Rahman, 28, is on a journey from the village of Surai Zaidek in
remote southeastern Afghanistan, where remnants of the radical
Islamic Taliban regime and its Al Qaeda allies, and centuries-old
customs, are still firmly entrenched.</LD>
<TE>   With her father, Ahmad Khan, 53, as escort, she is making her way
to Kabul to join the emergency loya jirga, or grand council, which
will convene Monday to choose Afghanistan's new leaders. In a huge
air-conditioned tent last used as a beer hall in Munich, Germany, an
ethnic Pushtun woman from a village of 350 people will stand to
address about 1,500 other delegates, and the watching world.</TE>
<TE>   And she will say it is time that Afghan women are heard.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman's father persuaded her to become a delegate.</TE>
<TE>   He also deflected the flak when villagers got upset that a woman
would have the cheek to leave her husband's home and stick her nose
in men's business at the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   She admits that it is frightening, especially because she is
defying dangerous people, Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters who still
move through the mountains above her two-room house.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Rahman's husband, Saheb Khan, a farmer, supported her.
His family did too. Then the neighbors came calling.</TE>
<TE>   "They told my in-laws, 'To enroll a woman in the loya jirga is a
scandal,' " Rahman said through an interpreter. "They had a lot of
complaints, so my in-laws told me to forget this job.</TE>
<TE>   "Then my father told them that they had already agreed to let me
go, that he had given my name to the loya jirga people and it was not
appropriate to change it."</TE>
<TE>   The village relented, and at 3 a.m. one recent day, Rahman
embarked on the most daring passage of her life without waking her
three children--daughter Mina, 7, and sons Sahebullah, 5, and
Wahebullah, 2--to say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to serve my village women and also serve my country,"
said Rahman, a 10th-grade graduate who works in her village's simple
Swedish-funded health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Our country has been in critical condition during 23 years of
war, and we have suffered a lot," she said. "And now we must join
with men, so that we can rebuild our country sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman's father was a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet-backed
Afghan army that fought the moujahedeen rebels in the 1980s, and then
served two years under the moujahedeen government that followed the
Soviets' withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that in the badlands of Paktia province, to which his
daughter must return when the grandeur of the loya jirga ends,
principles won't keep you alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I educated my daughter. I enrolled her in school so that she
would serve her country, her people," Khan said, and he paused a
moment under the weight of a burden they now shoulder together.</TE>
<TE>   "Paktia is a mountainous area, and in such a [dangerous] place, no
one can take the step we've taken," he continued. "But we took this
step because we were determined to take part in the loya jirga, even
if we are killed."</TE>
<TE>   To make sure that women could join in the loya jirga, the
council's organizing commission appointed 160 female delegates,
rather than hoping that local leaders would elect them. (As expected,
no women were directly elected.)</TE>
<TE>   Rahman was selected after reading her nine-minute speech to 19
commissioners, all of them men. Her sister-in-law Momena, 40, was the
only other woman in the room, a government customs office.</TE>
<TE>   In an indirect election across the country, groups of electors
picked by local leaders in 390 electoral districts chose 1,050 loya
jirga delegates. They will be joined by appointed academics,
religious scholars and professionals.</TE>
<TE>   The run-up to the grand council's weeklong meeting has been marred
by boycott threats, intimidation, killings and allegations of
vote-buying, none of which is unusual in South Asian politics.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and main base of
the Taliban's support, are especially unhappy because they think that
they're not getting their fair share of the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Minority Tajiks and Uzbeks in the former Northern Alliance won the
largest stake of national power when, with the help of U.S. bombing,
they seized the capital from the Taliban last year. Some Pushtun
leaders are warning of a revolt if the loya jirga doesn't shift power
back in their favor.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the arguing is just about their share, nothing else," Haji
Aslam Khan, a loya jirga commission official, said after a
delegate-selection meeting outside the city of Gardez ended in a
fistfight. It was quickly stopped by the sound of Afghan soldiers
slipping the bolts on their AK-47s.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute turned on whether minority Tajiks in Gardez were
getting too many of the overwhelmingly Pushtun district's seats on
the loya jirga. Order was restored, but the argument wasn't resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations said late last month that eight people involved
in the loya jirga selection process had been killed, half of them
district electors or "potential candidates." There was no evidence to
suggest that any of the killings were politically motivated, U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva stressed.</TE>
<TE>   In the western district of Herat, two people chosen to select
delegates to the loya jirga were arrested and a third detained before
being released.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with what goes on in more stable neighboring states, such
as India and Pakistan, Afghanistan's transition from 23 years of war
has been surprisingly smooth. The real trouble might come after the
loya jirga chooses the next government and the losers decide whether
they can live with it. U.S. officials have reported that their
intelligence has warned of a possible terrorist attack during the
loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   Haji Aslam Khan is the loya jirga commission's deputy chief in
southeastern Afghanistan. It includes some of the most dangerous
parts of the country, such as the region around Khowst, where U.S.
Special Forces are on the hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Khan is also a moujahedeen hero of the war against the Soviets,
and although he has grown a little large and soft around the middle,
he still commands the respect essential to making the loya jirga
acceptable in the countryside, where suspicions run deep.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 Pushtun leaders gathered at his feet, sitting among
stones and prickly weeds, at a delegate selection meeting late last
month in the village of Tera Kotel, just outside Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   With a U.N. observer listening to his every translated word for
any hint of scheming, Khan read out the names from a handwritten list
of the men's chosen delegates.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he the right person?" Khan asked through a white megaphone.
"Do you agree with him?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes! We accept!" the men replied in chorus.</TE>
<TE>   One of the chosen delegates was too old and frail to stand and
accept his honor.</TE>
<TE>   "Then how will you go to Kabul?" Khan boomed, and the electors
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   When a man stood to object to one of the selections, the U.N.
observer stopped Khan to make sure that he was really waiting for
dissenters to speak. Khan read out the next name and paused
deliberately for effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure this is the right one?" he asked. "Will you not feel
regretful?" And the electors laughed again.</TE>
<TE>   The last loya jirga convened in 1964, when monarch Mohammad Zaher
Shah wanted to reform the constitution, make the country more
democratic and enshrine the legal equality of women.</TE>
<TE>   He was overthrown nine years later and lived in exile in Italy as
Afghanistan slowly disintegrated. He has returned to lead this week's
loya jirga, which some predict will elect him head of state.</TE>
<TE>   There were only 452 delegates in 1964, four of them women
appointed by the king. Two more women were members of the
constitutional advisory commission. But one was only a part-time
delegate because she gave birth while the loya jirga was meeting.</TE>
<TE>   That "led to official comments by several religious leaders on the
superiority of men in legislative matters, though they granted the
biological superiority of women," wrote Louis Dupree, a U.S. expert
on Afghan history and archeology.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, there were rumored plots to subvert the grand
council's deliberations, and extra troops were deployed to prevent
attacks. But the delegates completed their work in peace, with much
more spirited debate than many had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Observers were surprised at the strong defense of individual
rights that came from some rural delegates, Dupree wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman also defied the stereotypes of rural Afghanistan as she
spoke in the half-light at one end of a small room in a local
general's house, watched by half a dozen of his men who had gathered
to supervise her interview with a foreign male reporter. They seemed
fascinated that a woman could have such strong opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Her burka was nowhere to be seen. Instead, she was draped in a
black head scarf that revealed only her face. Before long, a hand
poked out to stress a point, and then another, and her silver
bracelet glinted in the afternoon light.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman has no argument against wearing her burka whenever she goes
outside because that is what obedience to custom, Islam and men
demands, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they respect us, it doesn't matter if we're covered,"
she added.</TE>
<TE>   When she left the general's house, about 30 miles southeast of
Kabul, she walked along a dusty village road several steps behind her
father. They passed a meeting of local electors choosing delegates
for the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   A visitor from Kabul recognized one of them as Mohammed Usman,
widely hated as a ruthless Taliban commander before he fled the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   He is just the sort of man who might not wish a woman like Rahman
well. But, for now, she was just one more anonymous woman, safely
under cover of her long blue burka.</TE>

<HD>Hostage Describes Cross-Fire</HD>
<DH>The Philippines: Wife of slain missionary says he and a
Filipina died in the gun battle during the army's rescue effort, her
relatives report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER and RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Neither of the hostages killed during a blood-soaked rescue attempt
Friday in the Philippines appeared to have been executed by their
captors, according to the surviving captive, but rather died in a
hail of gunfire between government troops and the Muslim extremists.</LD>
<LD>   Missionary Gracia Burnham told family members in Kansas on Friday
that the men holding her, husband Martin and Philippine nurse Deborah
Yap didn't seem to intentionally shoot the hostages, who had been
held for more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Burnham and Yap were killed and Gracia was wounded in the
rescue attempt by U.S.-trained Philippine commandos.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't understand from her story that there had been any
executions," Teresa Burnham, Martin's sister, said in an interview in
Rose Hill, Kan., after talking by phone with Gracia. "That wasn't
what happened, she told us. They were caught in the cross-fire."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, some Philippine army officers maintained that the
hostages were coldbloodedly shot by members of the Abu Sayyaf, the
kidnappers. The colonel who led the raid called the radical Islamic
captors "wild animals" who mercilessly killed the two.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila on Saturday, a member of the Philippine Congress said
the army should stop calling the rescue attempt a success and
acknowledge that it had botched the effort. Lawmaker Liza Maza called
for an investigation of the army's conduct. "The rescue operation was
a disaster," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes defended the army,
noting that it was operating in dense jungle under difficult
conditions. "We have to be proud of our soldiers," he said. "It is
wrong to say this is a bungled operation. I congratulate the soldiers
in the operation. I want to tell them that accidents do happen."</TE>
<TE>   President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Saturday ordered a
"search-and-destroy" mission in the jungles of the southern
Philippines to find the group of rebels led by Abu Sabaya, the
notorious, taunting spokesman of the Abu Sayyaf. Sabaya and about 50
Abu Sayyaf members escaped after the rescue attempt. The army
deployed four battalions totaling 2,400 troops to track down the
rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it would be easier to fight the extremists now that
they no longer have hostages to shield them. But the army will have
to find them first. By Saturday night, it appeared that the rebels
had split up and disappeared into the thick jungles of the southern
island of Mindanao.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo warned that the rebels might try to flee to neighboring
Malaysia or Indonesia and asked for help in catching them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a terrible tragedy," she said. "We will not rest until we
bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice."</TE>
<TE>   So far, all the army has of rebel commander Sabaya are his
trademark sunglasses and his backpack. Philippine soldiers displayed
the items Saturday to show how close they had been to capturing him.</TE>
<TE>   Both the U.S. and Philippine governments said no American troops
were on the ground during Friday's battle, which also left four
rebels dead and seven soldiers wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Although hostage rescue missions are among the most difficult that
special operations forces perform, a rescue attempt in which two of
the three hostages are killed and the third wounded might be
considered a particularly grim failure.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine Scout Rangers who carried out the assault had been
trained by U.S. Army Special Forces troops and benefited from
American spy satellites and other U.S. intelligence sources. Before
the raid, however, some U.S. Army officials had expressed doubt about
the Scout Rangers' ability to carry out a difficult hostage-rescue
mission.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, en route to Estonia on
Saturday, cautioned against second-guessing the Filipinos. "You can
be darn sure the people trying to do it cared deeply and wanted to do
it and wanted it to succeed fully," he said, according to a Pentagon
transcript of his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. effort to train Philippine troops in anti-terrorist
techniques is scheduled to end July 31. Although some legislators
have suggested that the botched rescue indicated that it is time for
the U.S. to let the Philippine government pursue the Abu Sayyaf on
its own, the Burnham family and lawmakers in Kansas argued that the
raid demonstrates the need for more American aid. As workers in Rose
Hill tied yellow ribbons around the town's trees Saturday, the
Burnham family hunkered down in a house so filled with flowers it was
becoming difficult to move around.</TE>
<TE>   In between calls of condolence from friends and strangers alike,
the relatives continued the awful business of bringing home a wounded
loved one and the body of another.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials in Okinawa, Japan, had asked for Martin Burnham's
dental records. Although the precise nature of his fatal wounds is
unclear, Gracia Burnham told family members that his face was easily
recognizable. But relatives called their dentist anyway, who rushed
to help.</TE>
<TE>   They waited for another call from Gracia, who is staying at the
U.S. Embassy in Manila and is believed to be accompanied now by
Martin Burnham's sister Cheryl Spicer, who along with her husband,
Walt, also is a missionary in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   They talked and grieved over the details of the couple's final
minutes together.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, 42, was hit almost immediately when the gunfire erupted in
the predawn hours Friday, his wife would recall. He fell to the
ground, lying in the leaves and mud of the jungle, his breathing
shallow.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Gracia, 43, was hit in the thigh. She rolled up
against her husband, she told her family, playing dead as the bullets
snapped overhead. She heard Martin take a deep breath and then go
limp.</TE>
<TE>   She lay motionless next to his body until the firing stopped and
Philippine soldiers came.</TE>
<TE>   "They ended up side by side," Teresa Burnham said. "She knew she
was wounded in the leg and that he was wounded. That's how they spent
their last minutes together. She knew when he died."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paddock reported from Manila and Slater from Rose Hill, Kan. Times
staff writer Judy Pasternak in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>An Islamic militant with reported ties to accused Sept. 11
conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui was placed under investigation
Saturday in connection with a plot to blow up a cathedral in the
eastern French city of Strasbourg, judicial officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, who has French and Algerian citizenship, was put under
investigation, one step short of being charged, by French Judge
Jean-Francois Ricard, officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Police arrested the suspect Tuesday at his home in Paris,
they said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, who was not identified, allegedly had a role in a
failed plot to bomb the cathedral in 2000. Investigators believe that
Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, financed the plot.</LD>
<TE>   A group of Algerians is on trial in Germany for plotting the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   French television reported that the suspect had been in contact
with Moussaoui, a French national who is the only person charged in
the U.S. with conspiring to carry out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe that the new suspect also has lived in
Afghanistan and had ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>Interim Afghan Leader Given a Boost</HD>
<DH>Politics: Defense minister backs Karzai as the next head of
state, signaling his break from ex-president's ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Easing fears that wartime commanders might revolt if interim leader
Hamid Karzai is chosen as Afghanistan's next head of state this week,
the country's defense minister threw his heavily armed support
Saturday behind the respected prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim was a key fighter in the
Northern Alliance, which ousted the hard-line Islamic Taliban regime
last year, and his loyalty to the Karzai government had been in
doubt. The December appointment of the ethnic Tajik commander to head
the ragtag Tajik-dominated armed forces was seen at the time as a
strategic appeasement.</LD>
<LD>   "If Hamid Karzai is again selected to head the government, the
people will have chosen a moderate who will surely serve Afghanistan
better than anyone else to bring national unity, security, peace and
stability in the country," Fahim told a news conference ahead of
Monday's start of the weeklong loya jirga, or grand council, to
choose the country's new leaders.</LD>
<TE>   He described Karzai and the current Cabinet as "young, energetic
and moderate."</TE>
<TE>   Fahim's lavish praise of Karzai, an ethnic Pushtun, confirmed his
clear break from the ranks of former President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
who was thought to still hold sway over Fahim and other Northern
Alliance fighters in the Karzai Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Suave and multilingual, Karzai has won much national respect and
foreign aid for maintaining relative peace for the last six months
after 23 years of war. But several regional chieftains and even some
of his own Cabinet officials have appeared to be merely tolerating
Karzai until the loya jirga, to be held in a giant tent here in the
capital, opens up new opportunities to redistribute power.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim, Foreign Minister Abdullah and Interior Minister Younis
Qanooni were all aligned with Rabbani during his chaotic 1992-96
rule, between the fall of Soviet-installed leaders and the rise to
power of the Taliban. United Nations officials and others monitoring
the political transformation have accused Rabbani of waging a
back-channel campaign of bribery and intimidation of delegates to the
loya jirga in an attempt to regain power.</TE>
<TE>   Some had feared that Rabbani might persuade Fahim to use the armed
forces, which are almost exclusively made up of former Northern
Alliance fighters, to prevent any other leader from assuming the role
of head of state. Fahim controls not only the armed forces but also
the presidential guard ostensibly protecting Karzai as well.</TE>
<TE>   Selecting a head of state to rule until elections in 2004 is the
first order of business on the loya jirga agenda and is expected to
be decided Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim's show of support for Karzai probably represents a consensus
among the younger Northern Alliance figures, who were more
cooperative than Rabbani was during U.N.-brokered talks near Bonn
late last year that brought Karzai to power. Rabbani, a 62-year-old
Cairo-educated cleric, had occupied the presidential palace and
sought to block his delegates from agreeing to a peaceful transfer of
power after U.S. bombing helped drive out the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtuns, who make up at least 40% of Afghanistan's roughly</TE>
<TE>   27 million people, have complained bitterly of being
underrepresented in the interim government.</TE>
<TE>   They see the dominance of Tajiks, Uzbeks and others from the
country's northern regions--especially from the Panjshir Valley,
which was the home and power base of slain Northern Alliance
commander Ahmed Shah Masoud--as de facto punishment of all Pushtuns,
the ethnic group in which the Taliban originated.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fahim's political shift heartened the Karzai camp,
another regional warlord offered a stark reminder Saturday of the
rivalries that could still rile the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   Bacha Khan, who was fired as the governor of the eastern province
of Paktia this year for refusing to recognize central authority, is a
loya jirga delegate and has warned of a return to bloodshed unless
former monarch Mohammad Zaher Shah is chosen as leader.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is a Pushtun, like Karzai and the deposed king, the
Paktia warlord has rejected the legitimacy of the interim government
as a creation of the international community. If anyone other than
Zaher Shah is chosen as head of state, that will be proof that the
loya jirga was manipulated by meddling foreign powers, he insisted at
a news conference in the lobby of an unused Kabul hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the people support the king and love him and it was
agreed in Germany that he should be brought back as ruler of the
nation, we support Zaher Shah," Khan said, claiming that he spoke on
behalf of three southeastern provinces where he retains clout.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that the Bonn agreement on the transitional government
calls for the king to resume his reign. It doesn't, specifying only
that Zaher Shah preside over the opening of the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   The warlord, once aligned with U.S. forces fighting Al Qaeda and
Taliban holdouts in the roiling southeast, probably wants Zaher Shah
to regain power in hopes of wielding influence over the frail,
87-year-old former monarch.</TE>
<TE>   Although Khan's ranting stoked some fears that the loya jirga
could become a catalyst for renewed fighting, Afghan and U.N.
officials organizing the traditional gathering struck a hopeful and
positive outlook for the week ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not perfect, but the people of Afghanistan are more
interested in peace than anything else," the U.N. special envoy for
Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, told journalists invited to inspect the
facilities on a college campus where the 1,500 delegates will eat,
sleep and decide their nation's future.</TE>
<TE>   "The position of being 'holier than thou' is easy when you're a
spectator," he said. "If you are an Afghan trying to put 23 years of
war behind you, it is a little harder to take the high moral ground."</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi was responding to reports by human rights monitors that
some delegates have blood on their hands after decades of
insurrection, war and ethnic reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Afghanistan, who have suffered for years and years,
have made a great choice--the choice for peace," said Ismail
Qasimyar, chairman of the special commission organizing the loya
jirga.</TE>

<HD>The Graying of the Prisons</HD>
<DH>Incarceration: Longer terms and fewer paroles give the
state a growing number of old inmates. Many are easy prey for fellow
cons and a financial burden on the system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VACAVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Clifton Feathers killed a man in 1978, but he doesn't look dangerous
anymore. Today he's a blind, old convict in a wheelchair, easy prey
for younger prisoners who steal his snacks and keep him forever on
edge.</LD>
<LD>   Men and women like Feathers are an increasingly common sight in
California's sprawling penal system. Though the state's overall
prison population has been falling, the number of geriatric inmates
has nearly tripled in the last dozen years, following a national
trend.</LD>
<LD>   Feeble, addled by Alzheimer's or just plain old, they are symbols
of two forces that have defined California's approach to criminal
justice for more than a decade: longer sentences and a dramatic
decline in paroles.</LD>
<TE>   They also have begun to strain prison budgets at a time when the
state is facing a $24-billion deficit. Housing an old inmate can cost
three times as much as housing a young one, studies show, mostly
because the elderly are more often ill.</TE>
<TE>   At the women's prison in Corona, for instance, vans carrying sick
convicts make 350 trips a month to outside hospitals--at $233 per
trip, just for the guards and gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Loheac, 79, leaves three times a week for dialysis, a
routine that has continued for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   More typical is Ernest Pendergrass, 79, a World War II veteran at
the prison in Vacaville. Pendergrass, a wheezing, shaky lifer who has
survived four types of cancer and a stroke behind bars, is a walking
medicine cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Pendergrass' daughter, a pharmacist, estimates his 12 daily pills
run $1,800 a month. No one can guess what his surgeries, chemotherapy
and other care have cost.</TE>
<TE>   Those in charge of the California Department of Corrections are
well aware of the graying prison population and the challenges it
presents. But they have yet to tackle the problem head on.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the department prepared an ambitious plan for an "older
offender program" to better manage aging prisoners while saving
taxpayers money. The message was clear: Act now, because the number
of geriatrics will only continue to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, it appears that warning has been mostly ignored
by the Davis administration. Though many states have dedicated entire
prisons to geriatrics and launched other programs to handle them in
humane, cost-effective ways, California--with the nation's largest
and most expensive penal system--has not.</TE>
<TE>   The Old Are Treated Just Like the Young</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the old are treated like the young by the state's 33
prisons, their problems handled on a case-by-case basis that varies
from lockup to lockup.</TE>
<TE>   There are no systemwide policies defined by age--not for housing,
nutrition, health care, transfers or parole.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't seem to recognize that prisoners get old and have
different needs," said Laura Brisco, whose ailing 74-year-old father
is assigned a top bunk in a cell with a 20-year-old who plays rap
music all night long.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking for special treatment, just common sense."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Pickett, a deputy director of corrections, says
California's approach to dealing with aging convicts amounts to
handling it "through the side door, not the front door."</TE>
<TE>   He defends the state's treatment of elderly inmates, and said
upcoming improvements in how the prisons dispense medical care will
make it even better.</TE>
<TE>   But the man atop the state's correctional pyramid, Youth and Adult
Correctional Secretary Robert Presley, is not proud of the current
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Prison Chief Concedes That Change Is Overdue</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Presley acknowledged that "a change in how we
deal with this population is overdue."</TE>
<TE>   Presley wants to start by clustering old inmates in one prison, an
approach that, ironically, California pioneered in 1954 but later
abandoned. Presley has included the idea in his agency's five-year
plan, but he concedes it is not a priority for the Davis
administration. Though a change might save money down the road,
Presley says it would require some upfront investment that makes for
a tough sell when the state is in fiscal distress.</TE>
<TE>   As for other proposals--releasing the most frail, nonviolent
geriatrics early, for example, or placing them in lower-security
facilities to save money on guards--corrections officials say such
changes are out of their hands. The law is clear, they say: If you do
the crime, you do the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Are there women here who are doing 25 years on a seven-to-life
[sentence] and could probably be safely released into the community?
Absolutely," said Warden John Dovey at the California Institution for
Women in Corona. "But that's not my call."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators Unwilling to Look Soft on Crime</TE>
<TE>   Those empowered to make such calls have shown little inclination
to do so. The law-and-order mood in the Legislature--at its peak with
adoption of the "three strikes" measure in 1994--remains dominant,
especially in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto) pushed a bill in 1999 to
shift some inmates over 60 out of prison--either to newly designated
correctional nursing centers, or into electronic detention in their
homes. Inmates would have qualified based on their health, risk of
committing future crimes and the gravity of their offenses.</TE>
<TE>   With security costs representing a sizable chunk of the state's
$4.8-billion corrections budget, Longville reasoned his idea could
save taxpayers big money--especially in future years, as the
proportion of old inmates grows. But the measure died in the
Assembly, and Longville sees no groundswell of support that might
prompt him to revive the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people around here have no interest in letting anybody
out of prison," Longville said. "It's almost a religious thing. It's
certainly not a pragmatic approach."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) was among those opposed to
Longville's bill, saying it might have led to leniency for notorious
convicts such as Sirhan Sirhan, 58, serving a life term for
assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. More broadly, Pacheco says an
inmate's advancing age or deteriorating health should not be a reason
for mercy.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought that when someone reaches a certain age it excuses
their previous criminal conduct is anathema to me," Pacheco said.
"It's wrong morally. When you commit a crime, there's punishment
attached, and you're required to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Critics Say Old Inmates and Taxpayers Suffer</TE>
<TE>   Those who study prison systems say California's approach to
housing its aging inmates is bad for convicts and taxpayers alike.</TE>
<TE>   For prisoners, it means the old are mixed with gangbangers and
other young, still-violent felons, who show aged cellmates little
patience or respect. Geriatrics must follow rules and routines
designed for the young, live in cells built for the able-bodied and
eat meals prepared for those with all their teeth.</TE>
<TE>   For taxpayers, the mainstreaming of elderly convicts represents a
missed opportunity to save government money, analysts say. If
California grouped old inmates in a variety of custodial settings
according to how dangerous they are, it could dramatically cut the
costs of incarcerating them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about mollycoddling prisoners," said Jonathan
Turley, law professor and founder of the Project for Older Prisoners,
a national advocacy group that has advised the New York and Illinois
penal systems, among others. "It's a matter of realizing your
population is not homogenous and taking steps that can save a lot of
money--especially in a state with a prison system as large as
California's."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of aged inmates say the state penal system fails
geriatrics in many ways, but they worry most about their
vulnerability behind bars. There are two forms of currency in prison:
money and muscle. Elderly convicts typically have neither.</TE>
<TE>   "That lands them at the bottom of the feeding chain," said Turley,
"and they can sometimes be victimized just for show."</TE>
<TE>   In today's less-violent prison culture, severe beatings or rapes
of the old are uncommon. More typical is the day-in, day-out struggle
against extortion, bullying and disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know grandparents who complain they're afraid to walk at
night because of crime," Turley said. "Imagine being a geriatric in a
neighborhood where everyone is certifiably violent."</TE>
<TE>   Feathers, 76, is a vivid case in point.</TE>
<TE>   Blinded by diabetes and crippled by multiple sclerosis, he spends
his days rolling his wheelchair to and from meals, the prison
canteen, the shower. Helping him is another inmate on wheels, Bob
Hussey, 67, a chatty, bespectacled fellow who sticks up for his
friend as best he can.</TE>
<TE>   Before he met Hussey, Feathers used spoonfuls of instant coffee,
money and other items as bribes to get younger inmates to help him.
Hussey put an end to the extortion. But life remains hard for a
grizzled con who can't see.</TE>
<TE>   "Cliff can't manage his tray, so I bring him his meals," Hussey
said. "He needs a lot of help.... If he trips and falls, you might as
well shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   Feathers is a schizophrenic who was put away for shooting his
grown son. A World War II veteran, he says he mistook his boy for a
German soldier during a flashback caused by post-traumatic stress
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   At his last parole hearing, the San Bernardino County sheriff
opposed his release, saying Feathers had killed his son to collect on
an insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Two out of three parole commissioners decided the inmate needed
more "insight" into the crime and was not ready to go home to his
wife in Texas. The third supported parole. Feathers, he noted, is not
only blind and incapacitated but has been no trouble during 20 years
behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Inmate Ranks Grow Older at Faster Rate</TE>
<TE>   The graying of the prisons is in part a reflection of the aging
population at large. But the inmate ranks have grown older at a
faster rate, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is the enactment of laws imposing longer sentences for
violent crime, including the "three strikes" measure passed by the
California Legislature in 1994, and later ratified by voters. That
law, targeting career criminals, has so far put more than 7,160
felons in prison for 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   They will eventually be eligible for parole, but not any day soon.
Tweaks in the law have sharply limited the amount of time inmates can
shave off their terms by working, meaning they will serve longer
sentences than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   And these days, simply becoming eligible for parole is no
guarantee of a ticket home. The parole board and Gov. Gray Davis are
freeing far smaller numbers of prisoners than was previously the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show that inmates 55 and over now make up about 4% of
California's prison population, totaling about 5,800 men and women.
But experts say that number is deceptively low. Because their lives
have been marked by substance abuse, violence and a lack of medical
care, most prisoners are physiologically up to 10 years older than
their true age, the National Institute of Corrections reports.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say such inmates represent huge hidden costs in
California's corrections budget. Last year, the state spent $676
million on inmate medical care--almost twice what was spent seven
years earlier. Officials can't say how much of that amount went for
geriatrics, but concede the elderly are more likely to require a
24-hour hospice bed, expensive cardiac care, organ transplants,
cancer treatment and special supervision for dementia.</TE>
<TE>   As they grow more feeble and sick, geriatric prisoners also become
less dangerous. At some point in life, scholars agree, a sort of
"criminal menopause" sets in and felons grow less impetuous, less
prone to violence. Though there are famous exceptions, national
studies show that only about 2% of men paroled after 55 return to
prison.</TE>
<TE>   "So the costs of imprisonment go way up at the same time the
benefits of imprisonment, in terms of public safety, go way down,"
said Franklin Zimring, a professor at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School
of Law. Keeping old cons like Feathers locked up, he argues,
"shouldn't make us sleep any better at night."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, are more cautious. Pickett, the deputy director
of corrections, has seen inmates in wheelchairs "beat the bark off
men standing on their own two feet."</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be surprised what these guys can do," he said. And even a
disabled geriatric, he and others note, can still make a phone call
and orchestrate a violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for victims agree, and oppose leniency for aging
offenders. They say worries about growing budget deficits and
taxpayer dollars should take a back seat to the goals of punishment
and justice.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who commit these heinous crimes have to be held
accountable," said Harriet Salarno, chairwoman of Crime Victims
United of California. Salarno said she might not fight low-security
confinement for old, sick convicts whose offenses were minor, but she
objects to changes for those with violent pasts, however distant.</TE>
<TE>   "Society handed down the punishment," she said, "and the
punishment should be fulfilled."</TE>
<TE>   Presley, the youth and adult correctional secretary, agrees that
"paying one's debt" must be factored into any debate over how to
treat aged prisoners. But he also suspects that Californians are
compassionate when it comes to the plight of the elderly--even those
with rap sheets. He also knows taxpayers are "anxious for government
to cut costs wherever it can."</TE>
<TE>   One way for California to do that, corrections experts say, is by
diversifying how it manages aged criminals.</TE>
<TE>   No one recommends the wholesale release of felons just because
they are old. Indeed, though many of the elderly are serving long
sentences for crimes in the distant past, an estimated 45% are
incarcerated for offenses--many of them violent--within the last two
years, national figures show.</TE>
<TE>   But geriatrics can be a cost-savings bonanza for states that
choose to group them by risk, says Herbert Rosefield, a consultant
and former superintendent of a geriatric prison in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The high-risk group--those with potential for future violence--can
be clustered in geriatric units or stand-alone prisons, as Louisiana,
North Carolina, Ohio and other states have done. Such units save
money because they are staffed with specialists who detect
gerontological diseases before they turn chronic and more costly to
treat.</TE>
<TE>   A second group--those who may still be a risk for embezzlement but
too feeble to scale a razor-wire fence--could be moved into
minimum-security facilities or correctional nursing homes, where
fewer guards means lower budgets. The oldest, most infirm, or those
convicted of nonviolent crimes long past, might be moved into
supervised forms of release, such as parole.</TE>
<TE>   Pickett, the deputy director of the Corrections Department, says
he can see the fiscal virtue of shifting some old inmates to
lower-security housing, or even granting them early passes home. But
he says many geriatrics have no place to go. Those convicted of
heinous crimes are sometimes rejected by their families. Others
outlive their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Turley, however, said his group can always find someplace for an
old con. Many have veterans' pensions, others can qualify for halfway
houses run by nonprofit groups. Since 1989, Turley and his team of
volunteer law students have won the release of more than 200
geriatric inmates, a process that involves rigorous screening,
including consultation with victims. Not one of the 200, he said, has
been convicted of a new crime.</TE>
<TE>   With its 1999 report on older offenders, the Department of
Corrections seemed on the cusp of a new management approach. Some of
the report's suggestions were obvious: training guards to handle
inmates with Alzheimer's, developing easy-to-chew diets, recruiting
gerontologists. Others were more provocative: exploring options such
as early release and home detention.</TE>
<TE>   But a task force formed to tackle the problem never got off the
ground, because of budget cuts, officials say. And today, the state
continues to house inmates with no formal regard for age.</TE>
<TE>   James Marquardt, 70, is one who appears to suffer from this
one-size-fits-all approach. Convicted in 1997 on a sexual abuse
charge, he is scheduled to go free in 2020, but convinced he won't
live that long.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Marquardt is battling emphysema, heart disease,
lung disease and asthma that flares up when he's stressed--which is
most of the time. More pressing is his weight. Since arriving at
Folsom State Prison three months ago, he has dropped 25 pounds. A
prison dentist pulled all his teeth--"they were pretty much rotted,"
he said--and the dentures that replaced them don't fit.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really chew," he said. "So mostly, I just wait for mashed
potatoes."</TE>
<TE>   Marquardt sought help, but the wait for new dentures is months
long. Surrounded by young, muscular inmates shooting hoops, pounding
out push-ups and huddling in racial gangs around the teeming prison
yard, Marquardt sneaks nervous glances over one shoulder, then the
other.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see things getting any better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, California did not always treat inmates of all ages
alike. In fact, the state was the first in the nation to operate a
prison strictly for geriatrics, converting an old Army hospital in
San Luis Obispo into the California Men's Colony in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   But the special unit was closed in 1971 due to a dip in the prison
population, and its 1,000 inmates were dispersed. Another dorm for
aged criminals--at the California Institute for Men in
Chino--operated into the 1990s. But it now houses a mix of geriatrics
and younger inmates with missing limbs and other disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no systemwide policy on aging convicts emanating
from Sacramento, many who work with the incarcerated see the problems
and try to make a difference in small ways.</TE>
<TE>   At the California Institution for Women, Warden Dovey recently
hosted a meeting with older inmates. A few had simple requests,
asking for a heating pad or thicker mattress to make it easier to
sleep. Some women pushing 80 said they were worn out and wondered
whether they could ever retire from their prison jobs. The answer:
Not unless a doctor declares you medically disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Among those seeking help from Dovey was the dialysis patient,
Loheac, who asked whether the ankle shackles inmates wear to the
hospital might be waived, as their design was causing her to trip.
The warden quickly investigated, then agreed to her request, calling
it a "balancing of security concerns with dignity and humanity."</TE>
<TE>   At the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, where Feathers is
doing his time, Chaplain Keith Knauf trains volunteer inmates to
spend time with the dying in the prison hospice. Knauf sees felons at
the very end, hears their final regrets, hopes and fears. What they
all dread most, he says, is dying in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be free on the inside--spiritually--but they still dream
of dying a free man," Knauf said.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Parker knows that dream; he dreams it himself. At 68, Parker
walks with a cane and is speckled with bruises--evidence of his
tendency to pass out and keel over from time to time. He has high
blood pressure, heart disease, two hearing aids, false teeth, an
artificial knee. He's had three strokes while in prison and takes 21
different medications a day.</TE>
<TE>   A Korean War veteran, Parker has an Army pension, a house that's
paid for and children ready to welcome him home. But he's also a
convicted murderer, sent away for killing a man he says was running
around with his wife. And though he's served 20 years, the parole
board has not seen fit to set him free.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to tell them I could save the state a fortune if they'd let
me out," Parker said with a laugh. "But they just don't see it that
way."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Would Be City of Great Extremes</HD>
<DH>Secession: Divided by geography and income, there's a big
gap between its image and reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD and KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent weekday morning at the base of the Hollywood Hills,
Tatiana Zaza, 27, lounged at a table outside the Bourgeois Pig cafe
on Franklin Avenue, chatting into her powder-blue cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   On this block is an eclectic mix of shops and restaurants--a
newsstand called the Daily Planet, a theater called the Tamarind, a
used book store called Counterpoint and a French restaurant called La
Poubelle (translation: the Trash Can).</LD>
<LD>   "It's like a mini-Greenwich Village," said Zaza, an aspiring
actress who recently moved back to Los Angeles from Manhattan. "It's
artsy. It's young. It's where all the hipsters are."</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood has long been a magnet for the young and hip. But it is
a place of extremes, and the community trying to secede from Los
Angeles looks quite different viewed up close.</TE>
<TE>   From celebrity castles in the hills to homeless on the rough
streets below, Hollywood is divided by geography and income, a
collection of rich and poor neighborhoods, of bars and restaurants,
tourist traps and post-production studios.</TE>
<TE>   To the world it is synonymous with movies and glamour, history and
popular culture--images at least as enduring as that of Los Angeles
itself.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, voters will decide whether to let Hollywood leave Los
Angeles and become a new city of about 180,000. The Hollywood
secession measure is on the same ballot as one for the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks north of the Bourgeois Pig, where narrow streets wind
their way up into the Hollywood Hills, residents of the old
Spanish-style mansions, cozy English cottages and modern glass-walled
boxes walk their dogs toward the trails of nearby Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks to the south, on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and
Bronson Avenue, a prostitute in a teensy hot-pink halter dress and
foot-high glittery silver pumps teeters wearily toward a pay phone at
a gas station. The windows on the small houses in the surrounding
streets all have burglar bars.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood became its own city in 1903, and joined Los Angeles in
1910 to share in the bigger city's water supply.</TE>
<TE>   It was founded in the late 19th century by wealthy Midwesterners
looking to create a Christian utopia, one where bars were banned and
liquor sales prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   At first, it attracted retirees, who settled in Victorian and
Craftsman-style homes along what is now Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   By 1917, about 30 studios had made Hollywood their home, said
historian Marc Wanamaker. With the studios came wealthy movie stars
and moguls.</TE>
<TE>   The economy of a modern-day city of Hollywood would still center
on entertainment, along with tourism and health care, said Leron
Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   But a new Hollywood city would be a much more diverse place: about
42% white, 36% Latino, 10% Asian and 4% black, according to the
latest census figures.</TE>
<TE>   The largely Democratic city would be full of apartment complexes,
many run-down. Renters outnumber homeowners 3 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   As for the homeowners, roughly half of their houses have property
values of more than $500,000, according to a study prepared for the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce last year using slightly different
borders for the area. Many homes in the Hollywood Hills are worth
millions.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would be eagle-shaped, covering about 15 square
miles from Melrose Avenue north to Griffith Park, and from the
neighborhood around Vermont Avenue west to Laurel Canyon Boulevard.
It would own the Hollywood sign.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's population would be little more than one-seventh of
the Valley's and about 5% of Los Angeles'. It would be quite a bit
bigger than Burbank, but a little smaller than Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city government would consist of five council members,
who would select a mayor from their ranks. Hollywood would contract
with Los Angeles for most services, at least initially.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say that smaller is better. They like comparisons to
Glendale and Burbank, but there's a fundamental difference between
those cities and Hollywood. In Hollywood, "there's only a very small
middle class," Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the area's estimated median household income was just
over $34,000, compared with about $46,000 for all of Los Angeles,
according to chamber figures and the census.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity of wealth in Hollywood is partly the result of the
role it plays in drawing immigrants from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   While it is home to some of Los Angeles' most wealthy people, it
also is a magnet for those fleeing other countries, often arriving
here with very little.</TE>
<TE>   "Because everyone's heard of Hollywood, when there's a crisis in
another country, they tend to come here," said Dick Rippey, assistant
principal of Hollywood High School on Sunset Boulevard at La Brea
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   On Fountain Avenue, Jessy Losana, 35, stands in front of his
apartment building, tinkering under the hood of his aged Acura before
heading to work at an auto parts shop downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Born in El Salvador, he's lived in Hollywood since he was a
teenager. It's gotten rougher, he said, even though his
neighbors--working-class and poor Armenians, Guatemalans, Mexicans
and Salvadorans--generally get along.</TE>
<TE>   "Now if I don't got no car, I just don't go outside at night,"
Losana said. "At 2 o'clock in the morning on Santa Monica, you can
see a lot of prostitution and gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he considered the Hollywood Hills part of his community,
Losana shook his head no.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood High, where the sports teams are called the Sheiks,
growing divisions in the area have been very evident, said Rippey,
who has been at the famous high school for 36 years.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1903 at a bakery shop, it originally had 54
students--and over the years educated many, including Lana Turner and
Carol Burnett, who went on to be famous.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the aging and cramped year-round school has 3,000 students
and ranks at the bottom of state rankings in standardized test
scores. Spanish is the most commonly spoken language, followed by
Armenian. English comes in third. Three-fourths of the student body
receive free lunches, an indication of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   They're not the children of the entertainment bigwigs who live
north of Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get the Hollywood Hills kids anymore," Rippey said.
"They usually go to private schools."</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment industry employs about 10,000 people in the
area, Gubler said, not just at Paramount and in independent studios
such as Sunset Gower and Raleigh, but in many small pre- and
post-production companies.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, entertainment helped the area weather even the
Depression better than other places. When studios began leaving for
the Valley and Culver City, Hollywood's elegant hotels, restaurants
and shops still thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities were part of its lore and lure.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the height of its glory, Hollywood considered leaving Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A secession campaign took center stage in 1937, after the Culver
City Chamber of Commerce announced plans to take the name Hollywood,
saying it now contributed more to the film industry than Hollywood
itself. Actors backed the movement to preserve their community's
famous moniker by making the area independent.</TE>
<TE>   The movement lost its momentum a few months later, when Culver
City and Hollywood stopped feuding, deciding to focus instead on
making movies.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate, community leaders literally buried a hatchet into a
slab of wet concrete at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1960s, however, stars were becoming scarce. The
Knickerbocker Hotel closed. So did the Brown Derby and the Broadway
department store. No trace is left of some landmarks. Others are
remembered only by their old signs.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Hills always remained separate and serene. But in
the flats, new landlords failed to maintain buildings and rented to
transients. Boarded-up homes and burnt-out cars lined the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The high-end Garden Court Apartments, with its European
architecture, became known as "Hotel Hell" because of the drug
addicts, prostitutes, runaways and homeless who squatted there, said
Wanamaker, the historian.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, developers, homeowners and preservationists have
tried to revitalize Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Very active in the effort has been the Church of Scientology, one
of the top property owners in Hollywood. The church has restored old
buildings on Hollywood Boulevard; one once co-owned by Charlie
Chaplin is now the L. Ron Hubbard Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Some Hollywood residents are optimistic about the future of new
developments on the boulevard, including the nearly $1-billion
Hollywood &amp; Highland mall. That mall is the new home of the Oscars,
and the ceremony's return to Hollywood cheers its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   They also are pleased that the subway now carries visitors to the
spruced-up Pantages, El Capitan and Egyptian theaters, as well as the
area's trendy bar scene.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many people are waiting to see if this round of
improvements actually sticks. The mall already is struggling to hold
tenants, and Hollywood revitalization has failed before too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an up and down process," Wanamaker said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a worry for a new city, said Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In good times, entertainment and another Hollywood mainstay,
tourism, could be very lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   But recent history has shown how vulnerable tourism and
entertainment can be to the whims of the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, Kyser said, where a new city would have been with the
labor disputes that rattled the entertainment industry last year and
the huge drop-off in international tourism since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Hollywood Boulevard remains home largely to trinket
shops and T-shirt stores, but the down-at-the-heels Hollywood doesn't
faze A.C. Lyles, 84, a Hollywood office boy turned producer. He said
he will always love the place.</TE>
<TE>   With two loaves of bread, two jars of peanut butter and a sack of
apples, Lyles took a four-day train trip from Jacksonville, Fla., and
turned up at Paramount Studio's towering iron gates on July 17, 1936.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so happy to be here that I knew I'd never leave," said
Lyles, who has worked at Paramount ever since and now has his own
Walk of Fame star, as well as a studio building named after him and
scores of famous friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is still the most magical name in the world," Lyles
said from his fourth-floor window office once occupied by Fred
Astaire.</TE>
<TE>   "More people know of Hollywood than L.A."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IDAHO FALLS, Idaho</DL>
<LD>IDAHO FALLS, Idaho -- Authorities were trying to determine if an
ex-convict who killed himself after the abduction of a 14-year-old
girl may be linked to other crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Glenn Hescock, 42, shot himself in the head Wednesday after
a shootout with sheriff's deputies in a forest 35 miles northeast of
Idaho. One officer was wounded in the leg and a police dog was
killed.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies wanted to question Hescock in the abduction of the
girl, who was grabbed early Wednesday as she slept outside on a
trampoline with her sister.</LD>
<TE>   She was chained to furniture in Hescock's home before he left for
work Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The girl said she freed herself the same day by pounding on the
chain with a fire extinguisher, then called a family friend. Police
did not say whether she had been assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew she had a certain amount of time" to free herself,
Bonneville County Sheriff Byron Stommel said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hescock, who served two years on burglary convictions in Oregon,
was also a suspect in the September 2001 disappearance of Amber
Hoopes, 20, whose family owned a business where Hescock once worked.
Hescock was questioned by police but never charged.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies also were checking information that Hescock may have been
in the Challis area when 9-year-old Stephanie Crane disappeared while
walking home from a bowling alley in 1993, Stommel said.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Lockouts Aren't What You Think</HD>
<DH>Labor: Aerospace giant, amid layoffs, closes 12 bathrooms.
Workers cite inconvenience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>It might not be a high-profile point of dispute like job security or
pensions, but the Boeing Co. might have a new labor issue on its
hands: lavatory lockouts.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing this month closed and padlocked 12 bathrooms at its Everett
factory, part of an overall cost-cutting program to eliminate excess
services and facilities since the aerospace giant has laid off
several thousand people there. About 22,000 people still work at
Boeing's Everett operation, mostly in the factory.</LD>
<LD>   But while Boeing officials maintain that the "people-to-potty
ratio" has remained constant, roughly 3 toilets per 55 people,
employees say it's the distance and the inconvenience of taking a
bathroom break in the world's largest building--by volume--that is
the issue.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of times, I work up until the last second, and then I'm
running," said worker Connie Hoeppner. "Get out of my way!"</TE>
<TE>   Her office is already coping with fewer employees to do the work.
"When it takes longer to go find a restroom to use, it's going to
take longer to do your job," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing spokesman Bob Jorgensen said under Boeing's estimates no
one is more than 300 feet--a football field--away from a restroom. He
said the distance is just about 100 feet farther than they were
already walking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a hardship," he said Friday. "You always have complaints
when there's change."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, he said, there are scores of restrooms throughout the
factory, which spans about 100 acres and is so big that workers ride
bikes and golf carts to get from one area to another.</TE>
<TE>   Jorgensen did not disclose the dollar savings but said that three
maintenance staff workers who were previously doing bathroom duty
could now do other maintenance work.</TE>
<TE>   As of late May, Boeing layoffs since last fall totaled 21,300
employees companywide, with most of those layoffs coming in the Puget
Sound region.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's post-Sept. 11 plan seeks to reduce its labor force by
25,000 to 30,000 people by the end of this year to deal with the
downturn in the airline industry.</TE>

<HD>Retooling Cabinet No Easy Task</HD>
<DH>Government: Creating a department to oversee homeland
defense would likely be painfully slow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER and RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even with the full weight of the presidency in support, creating a
streamlined, fast-moving Cabinet department to fight terrorism is
harder than you might suppose.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind Al Qaeda. You're up against the National Turkey Growers
of America.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush had no sooner finished announcing his plan to
establish a Department of Homeland Security than lobbyists for the
turkey farmers, along with representatives of the National
Cattlemen's Beef Assn., the National Milk Producers Federation and a
dozen other groups, were on the phone Thursday night planning a war
council for the next day.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't want to be left behind when the government's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, which protects farm animals from
diseases and pests, moved to the new department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those silent agencies ... but a very important
agency," said Chandler Keys of the cattlemen's association. "We want
to make sure its historical mission is carried out, as well as any
new mission."</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism or no, the creation of a Cabinet department is an
enormous and inevitably slow process, not least because of the effect
on interested parties, ranging from poultry farmers to the entrenched
bureaucracies of the executive branch and the proud barons of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   If the terrorist threat remains high and the public remains
concerned, as most experts predict, then the Department of Homeland
Security could join Defense, State and the Treasury among the
super-departments whose reach and responsibilities make them powerful
players in Washington and influential forces in the country at large.</TE>
<TE>   History suggests, however, that achieving such a result will be a
long, contentious and frequently messy process.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself drew a parallel last week between his proposal to
create a single Cabinet department to guard against terrorism and
President Truman's decision in 1947 to create the Defense Department
to unify a fragmented military establishment that had endured almost
unchanged since the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   While the Defense Department has proved that such a large-scale
government reorganization can achieve positive results--after all,
the Pentagon now presides over the world's only military
superpower--that's not the only lesson for those who would create a
Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a century after Truman and Congress brought the
armed forces under one roof, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines
still fight each other almost as fiercely as they do foreign enemies.
Making them work together remains one of the toughest jobs in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   And, once created, the department would almost certainly be
revamped and fine-tuned regularly for decades to come--as were the
Defense Department, the CIA, the National Security Council and other
products of the 1947 reorganization, to deal with the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Larsen, director of a homeland security research group
called the ANSER Institute, calls the Bush proposal "a great second
step in a long evolutionary process of preparing this nation" to deal
with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his weekly radio address Saturday, said the new
department was needed to "unite essential agencies that must work
more closely together."</TE>
<TE>   Already, however, abundant signs suggest what a daunting task the
reorganization would be, how many knotty issues would arise and how
many battles would have to be fought.</TE>
<TE>   Just designing and carrying out the basic reorganization is a
herculean bureaucratic chore. With about 170,000 employees, Homeland
Security would be the third-largest Cabinet department in the federal
government. Where would its people work?</TE>
<TE>   Creating the Defense Department entailed constructing the
Pentagon, a 3.7-million-square-foot structure that still boasts the
largest roof in the world and accommodates a mere 23,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The question of space is one of the least recognized but most
difficult issues in any government reorganization, said Donald F.
Kettl, a University of Wisconsin specialist in how government
agencies function. "You want to make it so people can connect the
dots, but can you actually move people so they can work together?
Simply finding space is difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Since the whole point of the new department is to focus and
accelerate the normally plodding pace of government, pulling together
at least a fair number of its widely scattered components into one
place is particularly urgent.</TE>
<TE>   But the landscape of the nation's capital has become much more
crowded since the 1940s, when ground was broken for the Pentagon in a
583-acre patch of weeds on the west bank of the Potomac River.</TE>
<TE>   A far larger challenge arises from the fact that Homeland Security
would be constructed from bits and pieces of existing departments,
each with its own sense of mission, its own culture and its own
galaxy of interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a department, especially one as potentially powerful as
Homeland Security, means breaking into "the Iron Triangle": the
interlocking relationships established among government officials,
congressional leaders and lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Hence Friday's meeting of lobbyists for 15 livestock, poultry,
crop and animal health groups concerned about the fate of the
Agriculture Department agency commonly called APHIS, for the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service. APHIS was included in the new
department because it watches the nation's borders for foreign
agricultural diseases and pests, but it also provides a host of other
services that the interest groups don't want to lose.</TE>
<TE>   At the National Turkey Federation, for example, officials had
their eyes on what APHIS' new future might mean for its National
Poultry Improvement Plan. "We want to make sure that continues to
operate," said Joel Brandenberger of the federation, who attended the
industry meeting Friday. "But this whole proposal is not raising any
alarms here," he insisted loyally.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the level of bureaucratic headaches, the new department
must create a common culture among extraordinarily disparate
workers--Border Patrol agents working alongside nuclear scientists
from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for instance, and
security guards responsible for protecting government buildings
winning the respect of FBI agents. "How to get people to work and act
as a team is an enormous issue," Kettl said.</TE>
<TE>   The cultural divide is more than psychological. "You have to make
sure that different pieces of the organization can share information
and make sure that other things don't get lost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet different organizations have different ways of doing things.
All FBI background checks, for example, must be typed onto certain
forms. Typewritten information is more cumbersome to use, harder to
share and more susceptible to error than computer data, but that's
how the bureau does it. Efforts to give it a duly modern computer
system have foundered for years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Wants to Move Entire Agencies</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Homeland Security Department, the task is
complicated further by a provision of the Bush proposal: Instead of
moving only those parts of existing agencies that deal with homeland
security, Bush proposes to move the whole agencies and all their
functions--many of them totally unrelated to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   If those unrelated responsibilities are given due attention by the
new department's leaders, critics are already suggesting, they will
distract those employees, as Bush put it Saturday, who are supposed
to "come to work every morning knowing their most important job is to
protect their fellow citizens." More likely, the peripheral duties
will come out on the short end of budgetary resources and management
attention.</TE>
<TE>   James Lee Witt, who was director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency during the Clinton administration, agrees that
homeland security should be a Cabinet agency, but he worries about
unrelated responsibilities of agencies folded into it.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of local FEMA programs will be lost" in a homeland security
department, Witt said. "What would they define as a priority?"</TE>
<TE>   Livermore Laboratory Is Slated to Move</TE>
<TE>   For California's Lawrence Livermore lab, which is also marked to
move to the new department, homeland security accounts for only a
small part of what it does. "They do develop some technologies,
sensors to detect dangerous gases in subway stations and things like
that," said a congressional aide who is familiar with the laboratory.
"But they're primarily a nuclear weapons lab."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal must have been "developed by someone in the White
House who really didn't understand" what the lab does, the aide said.
"As more details come out, we're very doubtful that Livermore will be
part of the new agency."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also named the Coast Guard as one of the first agencies to be
transferred--from the Transportation Department--because the Coast
Guard patrols harbors and coastal waters. But the Homeland Security
Department will also inherit the Coast Guard's responsibilities for
enforcing fishing treaties, dealing with oil spills and rescuing
hapless boaters.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, the spokesman for the Office of Homeland
Security, insisted that agencies moved to the new department would
continue to carry out peripheral programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeland security functions are the most important, but the other
functions are not going to get lost," Johndroe said. "There are some
non-homeland functions that will get done by this agency."</TE>
<TE>   Original Proposal Likely to Change Dramatically</TE>
<TE>   In the months ahead, congressional committees--and the relevant
interest groups--will pore over the fine print of the new
department's constituent parts, detail issues such as these and
negotiate compromises. The final product, if experience is any guide,
will be substantially different from the original proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a new terrorist threat regalvanizes the public, the process
is expected to proceed at its traditional pace, which can seem
frustratingly slow but is the likeliest way to deliver a final
product with broad support.</TE>
<TE>   Within the bureaucracy, the president's unequivocal support for
reorganization will reduce resistance from his own team.</TE>
<TE>   At the Department of Transportation, for instance, Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta said Friday that he had no reservations about losing
the fledgling Transportation Security Administration as well as the
Coast Guard to Homeland Security. "I think what we have today is a
clear vision by the president that really deals with a comprehensive
approach," Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration, created several months
ago in response to Sept. 11, is in the midst of taking over security
at 429 airports, under a tight schedule set by Congress. Mineta said
that work would continue as planned over the summer and fall, and he
said he did not expect any delays in meeting congressional deadlines.
"We've got to stay focused on doing our business."</TE>
<TE>   Even if turf and other problems can be solved, some experts
questioned whether creating a new Cabinet department would really
make the country safer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's necessary to create a new intelligence
superstructure. That is exactly opposite the lesson learned from the
intelligence failures before 9/11" or from the complaints of stifling
bureaucracy from Minneapolis FBI lawyer Coleen Rowley, said Juliette
Kayyem, executive director of the Harvard Executive Session on
Domestic Preparedness, a think tank organized by the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   Unquestionably, one of the big weaknesses of the government's
pre-Sept. 11 intelligence system was a lack of coordination, Kayyem
said. But that was not for lack of structure, she said: "The
structure was flawed by actions of individuals."</TE>
<TE>   "Changing the chains of command doesn't itself necessarily change
anything," said Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution scholar and
coauthor of a report released this spring. It criticized homeland
security operations for focusing too much on preventing another Sept.
11 and not enough on predicting and preventing other types of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Reorganization May Not Make Nation Safer</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Homeland Security proposal has many of the same
weaknesses, O'Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really just focusing on trying to keep bad people out and
dealing with the consequences of an attack after the fact," he said.
"It doesn't answer the hard questions about vulnerability and how to
protect" weak spots.</TE>
<TE>   Reorganizing the government is a lot different from increasing
homeland security, he argued, and "to confuse the two would be a big
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Still, defenders of the reorganization effort think it's worth
trying. The ANSER Institute's Larsen recalled an observation by
then-Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower: "The right organization will not
guarantee success. But the wrong organization will guarantee
failure."</TE>

<HD>Feet to the Fire, Centralia's Old-Timers Are in No Hurry</HD>
<DH>Pennsylvania: A coal vein has blazed 40 years. The town's
condemned. There's little here, but as one of the few folks left
says, 'It never crossed my mind to leave.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CENTRALIA, Pa.</DL>
<LD>There is a spreading oak tree in the square as you pull into town.
Six metal chairs are at its base, arranged in a cluster, as though
friends had gathered there recently and suddenly hurried off. In the
trunk of the tree is nailed a red, wooden heart bearing the words:
"We love Centralia."</LD>
<LD>   The chairs remained empty through the long, cold winter and the
gray, rainy spring. But Lamar Mervine, the 86-year-old mayor, says
that once summer returns, in July or so, folks will haul two benches
into the square and, on warm evenings, you'll find the whole town
sitting by the oak, chatting and remembering the past of a mountain
coal town that has no future.</LD>
<LD>   For Centralia and its 15 mostly elderly residents, the future
vanished when the town--or more precisely, the underground coal vein
on which it sits--started burning, apparently when someone tossed
smoldering trash into an open mine shaft.</LD>
<TE>   That was 40 years ago, and the fire still burns. It has baked the
earth so that snow melts on impact, and filled the air with smoke and
gas-laden steam that creeps up through fissures in the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The state, which monitors the underground temperatures (they've
been known to reach 1,200 degrees) and the gaseous emissions, in the
early 1990s declared Centralia too dangerous to inhabit. It condemned
the town and established eminent domain. One by one, the 19 bars
disappeared, the high school and American Legion were torn down, the
545 homes and businesses were demolished. Almost all the 1,100
residents are gone too, after abandoning attempts in the courts to
save Centralia and accepting a federal buyout and relocation offer.</TE>
<TE>   Mervine and his die-hard friends, who sit under the oak and live
as virtual squatters in attractive homes now owned by the government,
say they have stayed for a simple reason: Centralia is home. And a
splendid home it is, they say, if sometimes a bit lonely.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure you miss having neighbors," said Mervine, who became mayor
when the previous one left town in 1993. "There was people like the
Shemonskis a few doors away.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have them back. But I was born here and I intend to
die here. It never crossed my mind to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "From day one, when the government didn't put the fire out--which
they could have done for a few thousand dollars in those days--I
figured they wanted us out of Centralia so they could get the coal
we're sitting on. People say it's a vein with 40 million tons.</TE>
<TE>   "So I suspect they're just waiting for us to die off. But
dangerous here? Not on your life. You can go over and ask Joe Moyers
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Moyers' house is the last one left standing on Locust Street. He
is 71, an 18-year veteran of the mines and a lifelong veteran of
Centralia's vicissitudes. On this day, he was in his yard waiting for
some of the 125 homing pigeons he keeps as a hobby to return from a
training flight to a nearby town. His two dogs, Barker and Penny,
took turns dozing and watching the sky for sight of them.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire's no danger far as I'm concerned," he said. "If the
town's not safe, how do you explain why my lawn's so nice and green?
Or why my pigeons are healthy? I can tell you a lot of the people who
left wish they hadn't. I don't know exactly who ... but I know they
miss a nice, quiet place like this. Anyone would."</TE>
<TE>   No deaths or illnesses have been linked to the fire, according to
the state, but two sink holes--each about 150 feet deep--did open up
in the ground some years back. (An 11-year-old boy who fell into one
of them survived by clinging to roots near the top until his cousin
rescued him.) And a section of Route 61 just outside Centralia, 115
miles northwest of Philadelphia, gave way in 1993, requiring the
state to build a bypass.</TE>
<TE>   The state has always maintained that the cost of extinguishing the
fire would have been millions of dollars, not thousands; a study done
20 years ago put the figure at $600 million and said the project
would require digging a series of trenches right through the heart of
town.</TE>
<TE>   As Centralia's landlord, Pennsylvania could force the eviction of
the remaining citizens. But the thought of state troopers pulling
elderly residents on fixed incomes and miners pensions from the last
12 homes unnerves everyone, and plans are underway for a new series
of negotiated buyouts. "I'm optimistic we can reach a fair conclusion
through the board review process," said George Michak, chief counsel
for the state department of community and economic development.</TE>
<TE>   The day that Moyers was awaiting the return of his homing pigeons,
there was the rumble of a Bobcat bulldozer in the Russian Orthodox
cemetery on the hill above his house. It belonged to Skip Shemonski,
who was raised on Trout Wine Street, near Mervine's house, before
making his way to the outskirts of Philadelphia and becoming a
builder-developer.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of many weekend trips to Centralia, he had
landscaped the cemetery for free and now was preparing a plot for his
recently deceased cousin and tending to graves that bore the names of
Michael and Mary Shemonski, his parents. Plumes of smoke rose from
the scorched earth just outside the fence surrounding the burial
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow falls outside the cemetery and it melts," he said. "Inside
the cemetery, it just lays on the ground, white and fresh.
Something's going on. Someone is telling us this is sacred ground.
Someone is reminding us there is something special in Centralia--not
like the city where you get in the fast lane and it's just the
pursuit of the almighty dollar."</TE>

<HD>Court Puts Age, Crime on Scales</HD>
<DH>Law: Issue is whether it's just to execute criminals who
were young at the time of their offenses. A Supreme Court decision
could help settle it soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Christopher Simmons recalls, above all, the desperation.</LD>
<LD>   It was Sept. 9, 1993. He was 17. He and a friend had broken into a
mobile home in search of cash to buy drugs. The woman who lived there
woke up.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons remembers a blinding fear, a boiling inside him, a panic.</LD>
<TE>   He grabbed 46-year-old Shirley Crook and strapped duct tape around
her eyes and mouth. He bound her hands behind her. He knew what he
was doing, but it didn't seem real.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed the keys to Crook's van and pushed her in. His buddy
got in too. They drove for nearly an hour before stopping in the dark
of a deserted park. Simmons then dragged Crook to a trestle over the
Meramac River.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed," he says now, looking back, "like I was in some kind
of desperation daze." He shoved Crook into the water.</TE>
<TE>   His friend, a few days short of his 16th birthday, was sentenced
to life in prison without parole for the murder. Simmons was
sentenced to death and has twice been scheduled for execution. The
Missouri Supreme Court has twice ordered a stay--most recently, May
28.</TE>
<TE>   As his case gained visibility, Simmons became a catalyst for an
emerging national debate about the use of capital punishment. At
issue: Whether it is just to execute criminals who were juveniles at
the time of their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's being debated, and debated furiously," said Steven Drizin, a
law professor at Northwestern University in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has declared it acceptable to put to death
offenders as young as 16. But 40% of the states that use capital
punishment have laws setting 18 as the minimum age for execution.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana was the most recent to ban the death penalty for minors.
Similar bills drew surprisingly strong support this year in Texas and
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than rely on state-by-state legislation, opponents of
executing minors put their strongest hopes into an upcoming U.S.
Supreme Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of this month, the justices are expected to decide
whether it's constitutional to execute mentally retarded criminals.
If the court rules such punishment is "cruel and unusual," activists
hope to stretch the decision to cover juveniles as well.</TE>
<TE>   Their theory is that, like the mentally retarded, 16- and
17-year-olds cannot be held fully culpable for their actions because
their brains are only partly developed and may lack key skills, such
as impulse control.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that their conduct should be excused, not that they don't
know right from wrong, but they don't have the same equipment that
adults do to make sound decisions," said Drizin, an anti-death
penalty activist.</TE>
<TE>   That argument, endorsed by the American Psychiatric Assn., failed
to win a commutation for Napoleon Beazley, 25, who was executed May
28 in Texas for a murder he committed at age 17. But it has
apparently gained some traction in Missouri. Though the state Supreme
Court issued no explanation in twice postponing Simmons' execution,
observers suspect his age is key.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, speaking by phone from prison in Mineral Point, Mo., said
that's how it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so young," said Simmons, now 26.</TE>
<TE>   He says he does not excuse himself. He says that a life behind
bars is fair punishment for his crime and that he does not deserve to
die.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons describes himself at 17 as unhinged from reality. He was
running from an abusive stepfather, desperate for approval from his
gang, hooked on drugs, scared, alone, unable to think beyond the
moment, unable to take control of himself even as he was binding
Crook's hands behind her back.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could go back and shake myself," he said, "and take away
the fear and despair."</TE>
<TE>   Pertie Mitchell wishes she could go back too.</TE>
<TE>   But the fear and despair she longs to take away are those she
imagines her sister Shirley Crook felt as the tape was winding around
her mouth. Nearly nine years after the murder, Mitchell cannot stop
replaying the loop: Her sister, bound, plunging into the murk,
wresting one hand free, struggling toward the surface, then sinking,
lungs filling with river grit.</TE>
<TE>   Crook left behind her husband, their two adult children, her two
sisters and her mother.</TE>
<TE>   She had been everyone's rock, cheering her kids on as they
clattered around in go-carts, concocting sugar-free treats for her
diabetic husband, bringing a baked ham to neighbors she barely knew
upon hearing they had a death in the family. About the only time she
nagged was when she told her daughter to hurry up and give her
grandbabies.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 9, 1993, Crook's daughter, Kimberly Hawkins, was several
weeks' pregnant. She hadn't yet told her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "The hurt is so bad," Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   She fumes at the suggestion that Simmons was only a kid when he
killed.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Boys will be boys' is for when they break a vase or throw a
ball through a window accidentally," Mitchell said. "He tortured her
... I want to see him executed. He deserves to die."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents point out that executing juveniles is banned under
several international treaties. In recent years, only Iran and the
Democratic Republic of Congo have joined the U.S. in putting minors
to death.</TE>
<TE>   But many prosecutors in this nation say they want to keep their
options open.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question you're going to hold a 27-year-old to a
higher degree of accountability than a 17-year-old. But that's not to
say there aren't certain murders so heinous that a 17-year-old
shouldn't be held [to] the death penalty," argued Richard Callahan,
executive director of the Missouri Prosecuting Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 30 years, more than 200 juvenile criminals have been
sentenced to death. Three states--Texas, Florida and Alabama--account
for more than half the cases, said Victor Streib, a law professor at
Ohio Northern University.</TE>
<TE>   Streib calculates that 86% of these death sentences have been
reversed or commuted. Nineteen juvenile offenders have been
executed--11 of them in Texas. About 82 remain on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Missouri inmate Antonio Richardson, who raped and
killed two sisters when he was 16. His lawyer says he is mentally
impaired; the U.S. Supreme Court has granted him a stay pending its
ruling.</TE>

<HD>Following Missing Girl, Fla. Foster Care Agency Can't Find
969 Kids</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A state agency that supervises foster children has not been able to
contact 969 children under its care, missing a May 31 deadline,
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Jeb Bush in April ordered the state Department of Children
and Families to visit or contact each of the 46,403 children under
state supervision by May 31.</LD>
<LD>   His order followed the disappearance of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson, a
child under state care who was missing for 15 months before state
officials noticed.</LD>
<TE>   By May 31, the agency still had not found 1,237 children and
Friday said that 969 children, or about 2% of those in state care,
had not been found. The agency is supposed to visit the children
every month.</TE>
<TE>   The agency classified most of those children who had not been
contacted as runaways, abducted by relatives or living in other
states.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they are still trying to visit some of the
children, including 421 who have been placed out of state.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a number we're not happy with," said Alia Faraj, the
agency's spokeswoman. "But it's a step forward. It's a huge effort."</TE>
<TE>   A message left with the DCF was not immediately returned.</TE>

<HD>Man Ruled Out as Suspect in Utah Kidnap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Police searching for the 14-year-old girl reportedly kidnapped at
gunpoint said Saturday that they have questioned and released a man
they had been seeking earlier in the day, ruling him out as a
suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Police on Saturday morning distributed a sketch of the man who
they said had contact with Elizabeth Ann Smart before she was
abducted from her bedroom four days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "We were hoping it would be something we could hang our hats on.
But that's OK. We'll move on," Salt Lake City police detective Dwayne
Baird said. Police said the man had no known criminal record.</LD>
<TE>   It was another dead-end for the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is still a suspect," Salt Lake City police Capt. Scott
Atkinson said, though he added the family is not the focus of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   While about 100 detectives follow up on potential leads, 18
volunteer pilots in small aircraft and helicopters took to the air
Saturday to scour nearby mountains and the Salt Lake Valley at the
request of Elizabeth's family.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that Elizabeth is alive. We feel in our hearts that we
know she is alive. That is a very strong thing," said Tom Smart,
Elizabeth's uncle. "She's somewhere. Check your basements. Check your
houses."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of volunteers have been searching the city and nearby
foothills for any trace of Elizabeth or her abductor.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth was taken from her home between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.
Wednesday. She was wearing short red satin pajamas. Police said the
kidnapper allowed her to put on white canvas tennis shoes before she
was taken away from her wealthy neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Initially promising tips haven't panned out.</TE>
<TE>   Police said an intruder forced open a window at the Smarts' home
and woke the teenager and her 9-year-old sister.</TE>
<TE>   The younger girl has not been able to clearly describe the man,
telling police only that the kidnapper carried a small black gun and
was about 5 feet, 8 inches, white, with dark hair, and was dressed in
a tan denim-type jacket and white baseball cap.</TE>

<HD>That Was Then, Locals Say of Skakel</HD>
<DH>Crime: Attitudes were more lax in 1975, when Moxley was
killed, some in Greenwich say. But others say the trial shows the
rich are not different.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREENWICH, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Over grilled fish and white wine at the Belle Haven beach club, the
consensus was this: The murder trial of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel
really revealed nothing about the good families of this wealthy town
today.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, the trial, and Skakel's conviction Friday, opened a time
capsule of an era gone by, when parents "were a little more laissez
faire and still drinking martinis," said real estate agent Jane
Galbreath. She dined with eight friends Friday night in Belle Haven,
the neighborhood where Skakel and his victim, Martha Moxley, both 15
at the time of the murder, had been living.</LD>
<LD>   After three days of deliberation, a jury announced Friday
afternoon that Skakel was guilty of clubbing Moxley to death on Oct.
30, 1975, with a six-iron golf club after a raucous night of
pre-Halloween mischief around Belle Haven's estates.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel's lawyer maintains his client is innocent, but the trial
showed a world of nothing near innocence: There were drugs, sex and
sibling rivalry; absentee parents and others nonchalant about a
daughter's beer habit; mansions, limousines and trust funds for all.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between '70s and '90s parents," Galbreath, 54,
said that her dinner companions concluded, "is that people now are
overly everything with their children--overly indulgent, overly
concerned, overly worried about achievement. But at least they're
watching."</TE>
<TE>   Still, while Greenwich residents comfort themselves to think that
was then and this is now, the saga of Martha-and-Michael, even with a
space of 27 years, gives some pause as they wonder if such a tragedy
is more avoidable today than it was then.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Greenwich, the suburb that a bull market built, is even
richer now than it was in 1975. A two-bedroom condo can sell for $1
million; Steamboat Road on the east side of the town, 28 miles from
Manhattan and once rife with empty office buildings, now houses
partnerships selling hedge funds for the richest of the rich; and
what was once a Woolworth's five-and-dime on Greenwich Avenue is now
a Saks Fifth Avenue with Prada shoes in the window.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "The Avenue," as the main drag of this enclave of 60,000 is
called, has no signals, but police officers direct traffic at
intersections.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just so much money around, you don't know what to think,"
said Janine Broadhurst, a Greenwich matron who attended several days
of the Skakel trial in nearby Norwalk--just out of curiosity, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody agrees the Skakels were a wild family and the kids
could do whatever they wanted, and that's not typical. Still, you
don't know," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, who is the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel,
lived near Moxley's 26-room house in his own family's mansion with
six brothers and sisters. His mother had died, and on the night of
the murder, his father, Rushton, was away fishing. The children were
left in the care of a live-in tutor, who had been a suspect in the
murder.</TE>
<TE>   While police had several suspects over the years, including
Martha's boyfriend, who happened to be Skakel's brother Tommy,
Michael Skakel was charged in 2000 only after several friends at a
private school for troubled kids came forward to say he had confessed
to them.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Dorthy Moxley, Martha's mother, refused to let her
daughter's death go unpunished, and the interest of journalists in
this Kennedy-related matter also kept the unsolved case alive. Many
people in this community said Saturday that they are simply relieved
the case is over and believe that the jury properly found Skakel
guilty. Still, there were no winners, they agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Moxley lost a daughter and the Skakels are losing a son,"
said Carolyn Snow, a retiree, playing with her grandson in one of the
local parks.</TE>
<TE>   Broadhurst said she woke up in the middle of the night Friday,
shaking. "I just felt sick, thinking: Here is this life of Michael
Skakel totally ruined. I mean, someone who was just playing tennis a
few weeks ago [in Florida] is now in jail. And it's not just his
fault. His family ... mishandled the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Fishman, a teacher who lives in Greenwich, also held Skakel's
family responsible for keeping authorities away from him for so long
that, even though his attorneys tried, the case could not be heard in
juvenile court. There a prison sentence wouldn't have exceeded four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Now a 41-year-old man, who has never held a job in his life, faces
a sentence of 10 years to life in prison, Fishman pointed out. That
said, Fishman does not think it is fair for outsiders to judge
Greenwich by the Martha-and-Michael story.</TE>
<TE>   "As a teacher, I see all kinds of problems around here, but I also
see lots of good kids and good parents paying attention, trying their
best," said Fishman, who teaches history at a high school in a
similarly wealthy community nearby, Westchester, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   This trial says as much about Greenwich as the O.J. Simpson trial
says about Los Angeles, Fishman's wife, Vicki, said. Both cases are
aberrations. "And at least in ours," she added, "the rich guy didn't
get away."</TE>
<TE>   At a lawn bowling competition Saturday in Bruce Park near Belle
Haven, Frances Novak, 82, said she was shocked by all the sex among
the teens.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha's diary was full of it," said Novak, a former town
librarian, recalling what she read in the local newspapers. "First
base, second base and so on!"</TE>
<TE>   Yet, on a brilliant sunny weekend as the aging bowlers, dressed
all in white, rolled black balls slowly across a pristine green and
swans fluttered over a pond, Greenwich seemed like a place where
nothing possibly could go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, don't kid yourself, dear," Novak scolded, narrowing her
bright blue eyes. "This [trial] cemented in my mind about privileged
people: They're just like the rest of us."</TE>

<HD>No Doubt on Guilt in Killing, Jurors Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DARIEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Jurors who convicted Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel of a 1975 murder
said Saturday their decision was based not on a single piece of
evidence, but an overwhelming set of circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of jurors believed Skakel was guilty at the start of
deliberations, while a few had questions about testimony that they
wanted to resolve, two jurors said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "For me it was the overwhelming weight of the various pieces of
circumstantial evidence taken as a whole," Bill Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   Laura Copeland said for her, Skakel's own mouth did him in.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe he is guilty," Copeland said. "I felt if he kept
his mouth shut for 27 years, [it] probably wouldn't have gotten to
that point. I gave weight to his own words."</TE>
<TE>   Smith noted a series of incriminating statements Skakel made over
the years to a Greenwich hairdresser, a family chauffeur, classmates,
a childhood friend and even an author who planned to write a book
about Skakel's life growing up with the Kennedys. He also cited other
signs of guilt, including Skakel appearing agitated after the murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutors kept laying it on," said Smith, a 39-year-old
corporate attorney. "It was so many independent sources."</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, a nephew of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, was
jailed Friday after he was convicted of killing Martha Moxley. The
two were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors played a tape of Skakel's interview with author
Richard Hoffman, in which Skakel said he went out to the Moxley
property and masturbated in a tree the night she was beaten to death
with a golf club later traced to the Skakel family. Moxley's body was
found under a tree on her property.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, personally, placing himself at the scene of the crime,
walking himself through the scene of the crime, was a huge error,"
said Copeland, a 39-year-old executive search consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Smith emphasized the testimony of Andrew Pugh, Skakel's childhood
friend, who said Skakel told him about the tree incident and
encouraged him to talk to a private investigative firm hired by his
family.</TE>
<TE>   "He was telling a story to cover for the possibility of physical
evidence being found at the scene," Smith said. "Andy Pugh--I don't
think there could have been a more credible witness."</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Copeland both said they rejected Skakel's alibi that he
took a trip to his cousin's house the night Moxley was murdered to
watch "Monty Python's Flying Circus" on television. Skakel said on
the tape that he had been in his father's car parked in the driveway
with Moxley and other teens when his older brothers came out to take
their cousin home.</TE>

<HD>Missile Data to Be Kept Secret</HD>
<DH>Military: The Pentagon will restrict information on its
antimissile tests. Critics say the Bush administration is trying to
quash debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will now keep secret key information on its
missile defense program, a blow to opponents who have relied on such
data to challenge the technology as error-prone and not ready for
deployment.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials said they will withhold the data, which
concerns flight tests of the program's most advanced long-range
system, to prevent U.S. adversaries from gaining secrets about
hardware intended to shield the nation from nuclear attack. Critics
of the program, including some influential lawmakers, say the move is
an attempt to stifle criticism and allow the administration to
control the debate on the system's future.</LD>
<LD>   "They're attempting to avoid the usual oversight by Congress, the
media ... and the larger scientific community,'' said Sen. Jack Reed
(D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee that
oversees the project. "There's an attitude of 'we know best, don't
bother us.' "</LD>
<TE>   Highlighting its technical weaknesses has been opponents' best
hope for slowing the long-debated program. In recent years, critics
have repeatedly used Pentagon data from missile defense flight tests
to challenge whether the experiments were as successful as claimed.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy comes during a year when the administration already
has moved aggressively to try to ensure the progress of the program,
which is a priority for President Bush and Secretary of Defense
Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Five months ago, Rumsfeld gave the Missile Defense Agency unusual
managerial autonomy and removed procurement procedures that usually
ensure new weapon programs remain on track and within budget.
Administration officials believe these unusual measures are needed to
swiftly carry out a program that is urgently needed because of the
growing missile threat from countries such as North Korea, Iran and
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Critics maintain that the new independence and secrecy increases
the chances that the Pentagon will spend tens of billions of dollars
on a national antimissile system that doesn't work, as it did in the
early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, the Pentagon will continue to give a week's
public notice before tests and announce whether the tests were
successful, officials said. But they said they will be providing less
information on test targets and on the decoy devices that are used to
try to fool the missile interceptors. Some details of the secrecy
policy are still being considered, they added.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon conducts tests of its land-based antimissile system
by shooting a long-range target missile into space from the Marshall
Islands in the Pacific. On its nose is a dummy warhead that serves as
the target.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, an interceptor missile is fired from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County carrying a
4-foot-long "kill vehicle." At about 140 miles in space, the kill
vehicle begins maneuvering; it tries to pick out the target from the
decoys and collide with it.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier tests, officials have described the size, shape,
composition and deployment time of decoys. But in the next test, due
in early August, officials may describe them only as "balloons" or
"plastic replicas," said Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman.
"That's probably about as specific as we'll go."</TE>
<TE>   He said the agency intends to disclose as much information as it
can and to keep Congress abreast of developments. He said it is
routine to step up secrecy as weapon programs become mature and
knowledge of weaknesses becomes more valuable to potential enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Critics don't dispute the need for secrecy, but they maintain that
it is not necessary now since the system remains in an early stage of
development, years from deployment.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think they need it," said Stephen Young, a missile
defense analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Data on targets and decoys have been a key part of critics'
challenges for almost two decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, during the Reagan administration, critics said the
Pentagon heated a target so that it would be easier for an infrared
missile seeker to spot against the cold background of space.</TE>
<TE>   After the most recent test of the ground-based system, in March,
the Union of Concerned Scientists challenged a statement by Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz that three decoys employed were
similar to the warhead and thus were a good test of the seeker's
abilities to discriminate.</TE>
<TE>   The group said the decoys had a different shape and had different
heat signatures than the target.</TE>
<TE>   James M. Lindsay, a former National Security Council aide now at
the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan public policy center in
Washington, said the Pentagon "has a legitimate security interest"
and noted that it remains to be seen just how far the Pentagon will
push the new security rules.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lindsay, who is an advocate of missile defense, added that he
believes the administration's conduct of the "war on terrorism" and
this issue "reflect the Bush administration's preference not to give
out information."</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an underlying desire to hold information close
because information is power," he said. "And clearly on this issue,
which is close to the president's heart, if you can control the
information flow, you increase the chances of getting the policy
outcome you want."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Coyle, who was the Pentagon's chief weapon tester during
the Clinton administration, said the new restrictions "are going to
make it much harder for people [outside the program] to know what's
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Coyle, who is now an advisor to the pro-arms-control Center for
Defense Information, added that the rules "could be
counterproductive" from the Pentagon's point of view if lawmakers
begin to think that they are not finding out enough to decide how to
vote on an expensive program at a time of competing national security
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that missile
defense could cost from $23 billion for a simple system of
ground-based interceptors to $68 billion for space-based lasers, and
much more if the Pentagon wants a "layered" system of various
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers already have been complaining that the
administration is not sharing enough information or providing for
input from other Pentagon offices that could add a valuable
independent perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Many times it's like pulling teeth to get information," Sen. Reed
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate version of the defense authorization bill adopted last
month would require annual reports on the missile defense programs
from the Pentagon's chief weapon tester and from the high-level
office that sets requirements for major weapon programs. Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
maintains that the reports are needed to ensure the program has
sufficient oversight and lawmakers have sufficient information about
the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's new policy comes at a time when missile defense
advocates think they have been gaining an upper hand.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the program will take a major step forward as the
White House formally discards the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
with the former Soviet Union, which limited the two countries'
development of antimissile defenses. The ABM treaty has been a major
point of dispute in the missile defense debate for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, the Pentagon is scheduled to break ground on a
test facility at Ft. Greely, Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The facility's principal purpose will be to test missile defenses,
but officials hope it may also be usable as a rudimentary missile
defense system before the end of Bush's first term in 2005.</TE>

<HD>Case of 3 Missing Women Still Baffles Authorities</HD>
<DH>Investigation: A beautician, her teen daughter and the
daughter's friend vanished 10 years ago in Missouri. Police have no
suspects or solid clues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Mo.</DL>
<LD>It was a night of joy. A high school graduation. Friends gathering
later for parties with plans to continue the celebration the next
day.</LD>
<LD>   But somewhere between the parties and the next day, things fell
apart for two classmates and one of their mothers. The mystery is no
closer to being solved today than it was when the women vanished a
decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   There are no solid clues and no suspects in the disappearance of
Sherrill Levitt, her 19-year-old daughter, Suzanne Streeter, and her
daughter's friend Stacy McCall, 18. Investigators and those who track
missing adults can recall no similar case.</LD>
<TE>   "In my 10 years, the case of the three women missing from
Springfield is very uncommon," says Kym Pasqualini, president of the
Nation's Missing Children Organization and Center for Missing Adults
in Phoenix. "It's very unique to have multiple adults disappear
together, especially under those circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Streeter and McCall graduated from Kickapoo High School on June 6,
1992. After attending two parties, the girls decided to get a few
hours' sleep before heading to a Branson amusement park with friends.
They arrived about 3 a.m. on June 7 at Levitt's home and prepared for
bed.</TE>
<TE>   When friends arrived later that morning, the three women were
gone.</TE>
<TE>   Their purses, containing cigarettes, money and medication, were
left behind. Their cars were still in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a broken porch light, nothing seemed askew.
Investigators found no telltale clues in the tidy one-story home that
sits a few hundred feet from a busy thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   Police have followed more than 5,200 leads that have taken them to
21 states, Sgt. Mike Owen said. They have checked tips from psychics
and called in retired investigators to review the case. There are no
suspects, but half a dozen individuals remain under suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   A new detective has been assigned to review the case, and police
hope the fresh attention surrounding the anniversary will bring new
leads.</TE>
<TE>   A Mother's Regrets</TE>
<TE>   For Janis McCall, a stubborn instinct kindles the faint hope that
Stacy, her youngest of three children, is still alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never give up--I can't," she says. "I have two choices: I
can completely disappear and become a vegetable, or I can go out and
try to help."</TE>
<TE>   McCall admits that at first she was angry--convinced Stacy was
invoking a new independence by not telling her parents of her plans.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, regrets mounted: If only she hadn't begged Stacy
to wait until morning to go to Branson.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to remind myself that I did not do this," she says. "I am
not to blame. Some horrible person is to blame."</TE>
<TE>   Levitt, then 47, had moved to Springfield from Seattle in 1980,
intent on starting a new life after a divorce. She worked as a
beautician and loved fixing up homes, her uncle, Cliff Williams,
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Williams pauses as he remembers packing up Suzanne's room, which
was filled with clothes and stuffed animals.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no suggestions for police or complaints about what they've
done," Williams says. "They just don't have much to go on."</TE>
<TE>   The case still gnaws at David Asher, who retired from the
Springfield Police Department in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was puzzled by the pristine crime scene, he says. "Mom's
glasses were next to the bed. There was a book turned over, as if she
had been reading. It just did not look like a crime scene."</TE>
<TE>   His theory: Someone plucked Levitt's small dog from her backyard,
then knocked on the door, using the ruse of wanting to return it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish more than anything that this case would be solved," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally think they have the information, but it just hasn't
been all put together yet. They need the piece that makes it all make
sense."</TE>
<TE>   In the window of the restaurant that Matt Marquart manages, the
poster of the three women remains displayed. "After 10 years, I just
can't take it down," he says. "I won't until this thing is over."</TE>
<TE>   What Marquart remembers most is how it changed Springfield.
Suddenly people started locking their doors, scrutinizing strangers,
trying to recall any detail that might help, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "That poster is tattered and torn--it has a lot of tape on it,"
Marquart says. "But it stands for something. It's a reminder that
those women are still missing. Who knows, maybe someone will see it
and think of something that will help."</TE>

<HD>New Yorkers {heart} Winners, but the Nets?</HD>
<DH>The N.J. team has played second fiddle to the Knicks. Until
now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Doormats. Whipping boys. Chumps.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since they joined the NBA, the New Jersey Nets have played
second fiddle to the New York Knicks, the dominant team in the
country's largest media market. They have suffered the slings and
arrows of outrageous New Yorkers, who ridiculed them as losers.</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<TE>   As the championship series between the Nets and the Los Angeles
Lakers shifts tonight to the Meadowlands, in a drafty arena built on
a swamp in East Rutherford, the Big Apple's once-haughty fans are
facing the unthinkable: New Jersey actually has a decent basketball
team.</TE>
<TE>   "Give them credit; they've come a long way," sniffed Lawrence
"Larry Legend" D'Earcy, lacing up his shoes for a game at Greenwich
Village's West 4th Street court, an asphalt temple where pickup
players from across the nation come to live, breathe and bleed
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just hard for me as a New Yorker to admit this," D'Earcy
added, "because the Nets were so lousy for so long. This year, the
tables turned on us like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   To understand the discomfort many here feel, imagine how Los
Angeles would react if the Lakers imploded and the Los Angeles
Clippers, whose very name is synonymous with failure, suddenly
vaulted into the NBA finals. At least L.A. fans would be more than
vaguely aware of the Clippers, who play in the same downtown arena as
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different world here. Although the Nets' Continental
Airlines Arena is only 10 miles from Madison Square Garden, where the
Knicks have played since 1968, it might as well be 1,000 miles
distant, given the vast gulf separating the two teams.</TE>
<TE>   Many Knicks fans, to put it mildly, would rather watch Boston
Celtics highlight films than travel to games in New Jersey. Their
team has a long history of winning and a cocky courtside manner, even
though its last NBA title came nearly 29 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, by contrast, have never snared an NBA championship and
have only rarely had winning seasons. And the fact that the team is
down 2-0 against the Lakers isn't helping New Yorkers find this
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go to the Meadowlands; it's much too hard to get out
there and it feels very far away," said author David Halberstam, who
has written about the NBA. "The Nets are a good team, but where they
play has been the black hole of basketball for so long. They've been
stigmatized for us."</TE>
<TE>   Other New Yorkers put it more bluntly.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole state of New Jersey is a joke," scoffed Don Passinkoff,
a retired high school English teacher who still plays pickup games
with guys a third his age. "But who knew their team would catch
fire?"</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not the Nets. As recently as last year, the desultory,
snake-bitten outfit won 31 games and lost 51. They have been plagued
by poor business decisions, boneheaded trades, a rash of crippling
injuries and a streak of bad luck reaching from Paterson to
Pennsauken.</TE>
<TE>   Few enjoyed playing in East Rutherford. An unhappy Net once
stenciled "Trade Me" on his sneakers before every game. To be sure,
some NBA stars, including Julius Erving, Rick Barry and Jayson
Williams, were once part of the organization. (But even some of that
shine seemed to wear off Friday when Williams pleaded not guilty in a
New Jersey courtroom to charges that he fatally shot his bodyguard.)</TE>
<TE>   Most telling, the team never felt that the New Jersey community
fully supported it. Not like New York loves the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nets arena was like one of those stupid sound studios and you
could hear everything because it was so empty," wrote former all-star
center Williams in his 2000 memoir, "Loose Balls: Easy Money."</TE>
<TE>   "Once some joker got hold of the loudspeaker system somehow and
said, 'Will the lady who lost five children please claim them.
They're beating the Nets 70 to 65.' "</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed. This weekend, the Nets will play the Lakers
before a sold-out house. Local sports shops are doing a brisk
business in Nets jerseys, and talk radio is boiling over with brash
predictions of a home team upset.</TE>
<TE>   In true New Jersey style, local newspaper columnists are bristling
with indignation over how the world sees them. "Laugh, L.A.--Nets
Don't Mind," read the headline over a recent Newark Star-Ledger
column from Mike Vaccaro.</TE>
<TE>   From Los Angeles, Vaccaro wrote: "Out here, we are viewed with
amusement, as just another set of droll characters helping to break
up the monotony of another perfect 78-degree day. We all wear
headbands like Springsteen, circa 1984. We awls tawk like Carmela
Soprano, circa 2001."</TE>
<TE>   As Nets fan Ken Daube picked up tickets last week at the
Meadowlands sports arena for Sunday night's game, he said the
sold-out crowd was something new for the team. Typically, fans have
been able to buy prime seats minutes before a game, often for less
than face value. Crowds of 5,000 to 7,000 have been common throughout
the team's lackluster years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he added, the Garden State finally has the upper hand.
New Yorkers "will have to make peace with our team, because it plays
well," Daube said. "But I don't think they'll ever make peace with
Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose, the Nets may have trouble getting fans' attention
this weekend. The NBA game is competing with other events, including
the San Francisco Giants and Barry Bonds at Yankee Stadium, the final
leg of horse racing's triple crown at Belmont Park, the Tyson-Lewis
boxing match and the Stanley Cup hockey finals.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no big thrill because the Nets aren't rivals to the
Knicks; they usually don't play well against New York," complained
Bernard "Mr. B" Chong, a regular at the 4th Street court. "I'm not on
the edge of my seat."</TE>
<TE>   His views were echoed by others at the small court known as "the
Cage," which is surrounded by a 20-foot high chain-link fence. Asked
about the NBA finals, most shrugged, offered grudging praise to the
Nets and grumbled about the Knicks' losing season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know too many people here who ever followed New Jersey,"
said Daniel Valladares, waiting to play. "I mean, as a team, they
could never reach us."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have certainly tried. A succession of owners experimented
with marketing gimmicks and promotional campaigns to tap into the
huge New York metropolitan market, with limited success. Indeed, the
team began to improve its financial fortunes when it made a decision
five years ago to de-emphasize New York and focus on developing a New
Jersey fan base.</TE>
<TE>   That campaign, recounted in "Marketing Outrageously" by Jon
Spoelstra, a former Nets president and marketing guru, was nothing if
not colorful. At one point, the team hired two sumo wrestlers to pose
as mascots and race through the arena at halftime. The most
provocative idea, ultimately shelved, involved a giveaway dreamed up
by ad executive George Lois.</TE>
<TE>   "George recommended that we hand out jockstraps to every man,
woman and child who came to our home games," Spoelstra wrote. "You
would get a jockstrap every time you came through the turnstile. If
you went to our full slate of 41 home games, you would have 41
jockstraps."</TE>
<TE>   It was an outrageous idea, he conceded. But to compete with the
Knicks and gain fan attention, Spoelstra said, New Jersey had to get
tough.</TE>
<TE>   Some New Yorkers have finally been won over, but it may have
nothing to do with the Nets themselves.</TE>
<TE>   True Love, a veteran at the Cage, says he'll be watching the big
game tonight and rooting for that team across the river.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I like New Jersey, because they got a long way to
go to impress me," Love explained. "It's that I hate L.A. even more."</TE>

<HD>Employee at R.I. Paper Kills 2 Co-Workers, Self</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>An employee at a newspaper production plant was found dead Saturday
in a burned-out car after he shot a co-worker to death and wounded
another, then killed another employee at his home in a nearby suburb,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Family members identified the gunman as Carlos Pacheco and said he
had complained of being teased for years by colleagues at the
Providence Journal.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Col. Richard Sullivan said Pacheco walked into the
Journal's production plant about 9:30 a.m., had an argument with
co-worker Robert Benetti, 38, and fatally shot him. Pacheco then
walked outside to the parking lot and shot Charles Johnson, 30, in
the face. Johnson, of Providence, was hospitalized and was listed in
satisfactory condition.</LD>
<TE>   About half an hour later, police found Pacheco's body in a
burned-out car in Warwick, about 11 miles south of here. The car was
parked in a lot near T.F. Green Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "I was standing on the loading dock looking out, and it just went
up real fast," said Greg Maynard, who works at Kenney Manufacturing
Co., where the car was found. "We just came out to get some fresh
air, then a flash went up through the center of the car."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Fandetti, 29, was found dead of a gunshot wound in a house
blocks from the car.</TE>
<TE>   All the men involved in the shootings worked in the same
department at the paper's plant, Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they found a handgun in Warwick but did not say if it
was the murder weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco's nephew, Jimmy Arruda, said his uncle had been teased by
co-workers at the office and relatives saw him crying about it.
Pacheco, who was in his 30s, lived with his mother, Arruda said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was quiet, easy to be around," said Arruda, 15.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Varin, a plant employee, said Pacheco called him last week and
asked if the two could get together Saturday to talk. Varin said
Pacheco didn't mention any work-related problems but did say, "Don't
worry, I can take it," Varin said. "I wasn't sure what he meant by
that. I would never, ever, ever expect this."</TE>
<TE>   Howard G. Sutton, the Journal's publisher, said the paper would
offer counseling Monday to production plant employees. "The
Providence Journal family has suffered a terrible tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   About 60 employees were in the plant at the time of the shooting.
Production continued Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Plan May Cover Pay Cuts Rather Than Job Training</HD>
<DH>Finance: White House backs a proposal to aid
trade-displaced workers who opt for lower wages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ever since the 1960s, the government has been paying people who lose
their jobs because of trade to spend a year or so learning new skills
before rejoining the work force.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's thinking about paying some of them to skip the training,
swallow a pay cut and get right back to work.</LD>
<LD>   Under a legislative compromise brokered with White House
assistance, trade-displaced workers older than 50 would be eligible
for federal "wage insurance." For up to two years, the government
would make up half of any wage loss they experienced after taking new
full-time jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The pilot program would be relatively small, and it has received
less attention than other parts of the big trade bill rumbling
through Congress. But it would establish a precedent for federal
intervention in employer-employee wage relationships and could pave
the way for a big government entitlement program.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of wage insurance acknowledged that the two-year,
limited test run could lead to something much larger.</TE>
<TE>   "If this program is viewed as a success over the next couple of
years, I think there will be pressure to expand it," said Brookings
Institution economist Robert Litan. "There's no good economic reason
to limit it to trade, and there's no good moral reason to limit it to
trade."</TE>
<TE>   That's precisely what bothers some business executives and
congressional conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a host of complex interrelationships, incentives and
actions on the part of employers and employees," said Bill Morley,
vice president of congressional affairs for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. "We don't know what effect this program would have."</TE>
<TE>   But wage insurance appeals to critics of traditional unemployment
insurance because it creates an incentive to return to work.</TE>
<TE>   The concept has been endorsed by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick and members
of the Trade Deficit Review Commission, a bipartisan presidential
advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot program is part of a big trade bill passed by the Senate
last month after weeks of negotiations produced a bipartisan
compromise. Critics will get one more chance to scale it back or kill
it when a conference committee tries to reconcile House and Senate
versions of the legislation. Besides wage insurance, the bill
includes other benefits for trade-displaced workers, preferential
trade treatment for four South American allies and one of President
Bush's priorities: renewal of "fast-track" authority to negotiate new
trade pacts, immune from congressional tinkering.</TE>
<TE>   Wage insurance would be only one element of a broader expansion of
Trade Adjustment Assistance, a 40-year-old program that provides
extended unemployment benefits and free vocational training to
workers whose jobs disappear because of trade-related plant closings,
relocations or cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Wage insurance would not replace traditional TAA benefits. It
would be offered as an alternative to displaced workers who are over
50, earn less than $50,000 a year and take a full-time job at reduced
wages instead of signing up for the regular program. It would pay
trade casualties half of the difference between their old and new
wages for up to two years, with a maximum annual benefit of $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   A hypothetical worker who lost a $12-per-hour job assembling
T-shirts and took an $8-per-hour job processing insurance claims
would experience a pay cut of $8,320 a year. Wage insurance would
make up half the difference, or $4,160.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing hypothetical about the wage loss faced by
52-year-old Walter Beals, who was laid off by Bethlehem Steel last
year and again in January. Full-time workers at Bethlehem's plant in
Steelton, Pa., earn upward of $18 an hour. For older steelworkers
whose skills aren't transferable, a new job may entail a $10 pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's layoff, Beals took a $9-an-hour job as a flagman
on a state highway maintenance crew. But he quit two months later.</TE>
<TE>   "It was costing me too much to do it," he said. "I was doing the
flagman job when my unemployment benefits ran out, and I wasn't
making my bills. I was going down the tubes."</TE>
<TE>   He got a reprieve when Bethlehem offered him a six-month stint at
its Baltimore plant. As soon as the temporary job ended, he went back
on layoff status. He's banking that he'll be recalled by Bethlehem
when the Steelton plant cranks up production again.</TE>
<TE>   "I've looked around, but nobody with a decent-paying job wants
me," Beals said. "When I was a younger man, they would have hired me.
Over the age of 50, it's 'Welcome to Wal-Mart.' "</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say wage insurance would extend a hand to older workers
who aren't good candidates for vocational retraining and who have
little prospect of finding a new job that pays as well as the old
one.</TE>
<TE>   Research by Lori Kletzer, an economist at UC Santa Cruz, shows
that one in four workers who lose manufacturing jobs takes a pay cut
of 30% or more when back at work full time. (One in three earns at
least as much as before, and the rest take pay cuts of up to 30%.)</TE>
<TE>   By narrowing that earnings gap, wage insurance may broaden the
kinds of jobs that displaced workers are willing to consider, Kletzer
said. In addition, insurance may motivate them to return to work
sooner, instead of subsisting on unemployment benefits and training
for jobs that might not materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pay somebody while they're unemployed, they have a reason
to remain unemployed," she said. "Some of the interest in wage
insurance comes from people who think the unemployment insurance
system could use a fix."</TE>
<TE>   Litan, the Brookings economist, said wage insurance would take
government programs in "a totally new direction" if it works well for
trade-displaced workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of paying people to sit at home and look for new jobs, it
pays them to go out and get a new job," he said. "Right now they're
letting the worker choose, but I think in the long run this is a
better model."</TE>
<TE>   As authorized by the Senate, the wage insurance program would cost
about $85 million a year once it is up and running. That's small
change compared with the $20 billion in jobless benefits distributed
every year, or the $1.2 billion annual cost of the expanded TAA
program.</TE>
<TE>   Morley, of the U.S. chamber, said wage insurance might be better
suited to a country like Sweden, "where the tax burdens are higher
and the government intrusion is greater. I don't think we as a
society are prepared to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics say the subsidies could distort private-sector
decision-making, with unintended consequences. Sen. Judd Gregg
(R-N.H.) objected to the idea of subsidizing people who want to
become golf pros or take other lower-paying "dream jobs."</TE>
<TE>   If that occurs, countered Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max
Baucus (D-Mont.), Congress can always pull the plug.</TE>
<TE>   "If it turns out the critics are right and wage insurance leads to
a glut of fly-fishing instructors, the program can be ended after the
two-year trial," Baucus said. "But I don't think that's what we'll
see."</TE>

<HD>Colo. Evacuates 300 Homes as Fire Rages</HD>
<DH>Danger: Blaze likely was ignited by coal deposits burning
for years. Smoke forces a heavily traveled highway to close. Utah
also has trouble spots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Authorities ordered the evacuation of 300 homes Saturday, as a
fast-moving wildfire in western Colorado roared to the edges of a
small town, burning homes and briefly closing a 50-mile stretch of a
heavily traveled interstate highway, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze had moved to the edges of Glenwood Springs, a town of
7,700 about 125 miles west of here. Authorities evacuated the entire
west side of the town.</LD>
<LD>   Fire information officer Mit Parsons said five homes and one
commercial building were destroyed, and at least 500 homes and 100
commercial structures were threatened.</LD>
<TE>   Resident Cheryl Dunlap said her brother's home and at least four
others were damaged or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother turned around and he saw 50-foot flames up the hill
and they jumped in [their car] and left," Dunlap told the Glenwood
Springs Post Independent.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross spokeswoman Teresa Zeigler said 300 homes were ordered
evacuated, and about 600 people took refuge at an emergency shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Strong, hot winds quickly fanned the blaze across at least 2,000
acres.</TE>
<TE>   Some flames were 100 to 200 feet high, firefighters said.</TE>
<TE>   Reported in the early afternoon, the fire apparently was ignited
by underground coal that had been burning for years, said Liz Mauch,
a Grand Junction Interagency Fire Dispatch Center spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The smoke on Interstate 70, the main east-west route through the
state, was so thick that some drivers had their headlights on in the
middle of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was in the same area as a 1994 fire on Storm King
Mountain that killed 14 firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Another blaze started by a campfire burned at least 100 acres in
Park County in central Colorado, destroyed one structure and forced
the evacuation of 20 homes and two campgrounds near Lake George,
Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   In Utah, a wildfire near Zion National Park burned across 1,500
acres, threatening 20 vacation homes and five outbuildings. The fire,
21 miles east of Cedar City and seven miles north of the park, was
one of three large wildfires burning in southern Utah.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Knew How (and When) to Ride Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The horses are on their way to the gate at the Belmont Stakes as the
fingers come down on the keyboard, and it's hard not to think of the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   The thoroughbreds of the NBA are galloping now, the way horses do
when they know they're just about to reach the finish line. The
Lakers have won four consecutive games at the most important time of
the season, including the first two games of the NBA Finals.
Shaquille O'Neal is dominating again, the way Secretariat did almost
three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   And they have a jockey who knows exactly when to go to the whip.</LD>
<TE>   I think back to a conversation with Phil Jackson in January, in
Minneapolis, when the Lakers were plodding their way through the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a time to squeeze them and demand their full attention,"
Jackson said after a morning shoot-around. "But the pressure of the
season and the intensity of playing so many games, a lot of times
it's just best to let them have the rein a little bit and go with
it."</TE>
<TE>   So Jackson let the regular season slip into a pattern of ups and
downs. The Lakers won at some of the most difficult venues in the
league, including Sacramento, San Antonio and Dallas, and lost at
home to such NBA lowlifes as the Denver Nuggets, Chicago Bulls and
Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson never panicked, never sent them back to boot camp. He was
betting on June, not January.</TE>
<TE>   "We got more days off than we ever did," forward Rick Fox said
after the Lakers' 106-83 victory in Game 2 of the Finals. "We did a
lot of light stuff. We didn't watch a whole lot of film during the
season. We didn't do a lot of stuff. We understood why, but
throughout the 82-game season we were looking a little sloppy at
times, a little disjointed."</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal's toe problems bounced him in and out of the
lineup, and more out than in for practices. Without the focal point
of their offense on the court every day, the Lakers couldn't find a
rhythm in their triangle pattern.</TE>
<TE>   That made such players as Fox and Derek Fisher look worse, because
they're so dependent on the offense running well to get them good
shots.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was out of shape and hobbling. Fisher was coming back from
foot surgery. Robert Horry is always fragile.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jackson] knows he can't have these guys go out, work them to
death, win 67 games and fall apart," Fox said. "We had a great desire
to win 70 games. But if we would have made that push, we would have
been no good right now."</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers played just well enough to win 58 games. Their play
within games during this postseason has been more of the same: enough
dominant runs or clutch play in the fourth quarter to make up for
long stretches of ineffectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to get the Lakers within sniffing distance of their
third consecutive championship. It's enough to make you think Jackson
really does know what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   At times this has looked like Jackson's worst performance yet. The
Lakers, unquestionably, underachieved during the regular season.
That's why they had to play Game 7 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Now the coach stands two victories away from surpassing Pat
Riley's record of 155 career playoff victories and matching Red
Auerbach's record of nine championships.</TE>
<TE>   And the closer he gets, the more he returns to his natural state:
needling rivals. The other day, in reference to the 1999 season, he
used the a-word that made him so hated in San Antonio: "You know, the
asterisk season."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to all of the whining coming out of Sacramento after the
Western Conference finals, Jackson said, "I do feel sorry for
Sacramento. It's tough to be good losers. It is. It's not easy to
do."</TE>
<TE>   It's killing Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman, who really loathes
Jackson, that he lost to him. Adelman had the coaching edge in the
first six games of the series, just as the Kings played better
basketball than the Lakers in those games.</TE>
<TE>   Having the best talent doesn't ensure you always win. Adelman
knows that first-hand.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman's inability to get the most out of his Portland Trail
Blazers in the early 1990s helped change the course of NBA history.
Portland should have beaten the Lakers in the 1991 Western Conference
finals. And if they had, they had the combination of Finals
experience and athleticism to beat the Chicago Bulls. And who knows
if the Bulls would have had the breakthrough that led them to six
championships in eight years and created the aura of Phil Jackson?</TE>
<TE>   Now he's at the point where success could hasten the end of the
Jackson era. If he wins championship No. 9 this year, it puts him in
strong position to break Auerbach's record within the final two years
of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   His recent comments indicate how much he wants to beat Auerbach,
in part to avenge the cigar-smoked losses Jackson's old Knick coach,
Red Holzman, suffered at the hands of the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   I think the quest for No. 10 is the only thing that could bring
Jackson back after his contract expires. Everything else he has said
indicates he won't coach a day longer. The knee, back and hips hurt
so much in October that he considered calling it quits early.</TE>
<TE>   He's feeling better. The Lakers are feeling better. The finish
line of the three-peat is in sight. Just because War Emblem lost
Saturday, it doesn't mean we won't see a triple crown winner.</TE>

<HD>Angels Falter in the Pinch</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Reds win, 4-3, after Fabregas, batting .190,
fails to deliver in unfamiliar role of pinch-hitter in ninth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a single out at their disposal and the game on the line
Saturday, the Angels sent a .190 hitter to the plate to face a closer
with a 95-mph fastball. Game over.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels almost won despite themselves, but a loss was more
fitting on an afternoon in which a team that typically plays hard and
plays smart neglected to play smart. The Cincinnati Reds did both and
won, 4-3, leaving the Angels' leader to shake his head and shrug
after the game at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "Day games here are always adventurous," center fielder Darin
Erstad said. "Why that is, I don't know. You see some crazy stuff. It
just wasn't an all-around good game."</LD>
<TE>   It ended with the Angels using Jorge Fabregas, their backup
catcher, as a pinch-hitter with the tying and winning runs on base
and two out in the ninth. Fabregas worked the count full against
Cincinnati closer Danny Graves, then grounded out.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could call the game, that's what I would do to a
pinch-hitter--95 at the hands. Good luck trying to hit it," Fabregas
said. "But that wasn't the ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   True enough. There are games worth learning from and games better
off forgotten, and this one falls into the latter category for the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In the second inning, the Angels ran themselves into a needless
out. With two out and Scott Spiezio on second base, Bengie Molina
singled, but coach Ron Roenicke waited until Spiezio had passed third
base before holding him up. As Molina saw Spiezio turn and head for
home, he headed for second, and the Reds threw him out.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning, starter Ramon Ortiz balked home the tying
run. In the eighth, Aaron Boone turned a single into a double when
Jose Nieves forgot to cover second base, and reliever Ben Weber very
nearly threw a strike on an intended pitchout, with Molina moving
outside in anticipation and leaping back behind the plate to prevent
a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, they loaded the bases with one out but did
not score.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, down by two runs, they loaded the bases with one out
and scored once.</TE>
<TE>   The inning could hardly have started with greater promise. With
the Reds up, 4-2, Garret Anderson greeted Graves with a single, and
Brad Fullmer doubled him to third. Orlando Palmeiro lined out, the
first out.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive at-bat, Spiezio came up with runners on
second and third and one out. Molina, who has grounded into the most
double plays among the Angels, was on deck. In the seventh, and again
in the ninth, the Reds walked Spiezio to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Molina flied out. In the ninth, with the Reds
having violated baseball orthodoxy by putting the potential winning
run on base, Molina grounded out. But the Reds could not turn a
double play, and Anderson scored.</TE>
<TE>   So the Angels trailed, 4-3, with Nieves due up against Graves, a
right-hander. Nieves was hitting .292 overall and .200 off
right-handers. Fabregas was hitting .190 overall and .189 off
right-handers. As the backup catcher on a team with two catchers,
Fabregas is seldom used as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   But Manager Mike Scioscia used him anyway, in part because
Scioscia wanted a left-handed hitter and in part because Fabregas had
three hits in his last six at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last couple games, Jorge has been swinging the bat much
better," Scioscia said. "I thought he could come in and put the ball
in play."</TE>
<TE>   With a crowd of 29,881 waving their beach towels and screaming in
anticipation, Fabregas worked the count full, the noise level
increasing with each pitch. Then he grounded out to second base.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually don't pinch-hit, but it doesn't faze me," Fabregas
said. "I can pinch-hit, but it's hard to do. When you don't play
every day, it's even harder.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's not an excuse. He made good pitches, on the inside
corner."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wooten Tries to Put Injuries Behind Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Shawn Wooten last played a game for the Angels 10 months ago,
he has suffered injuries to his left wrist, right thumb and right
side. He is expected to return within one month, but can the Angels
count on the utilityman to remain sound enough to play?</LD>
<LD>   "I can understand if they have a lot of concern, but I try to play
through a lot of pain," Wooten said. "I was never a top prospect that
could miss two weeks and still have my job. I've played through
hamstring pulls. I've played through a back problem. I did whatever I
had to do to keep my job."</LD>
<LD>   Wooten's injury siege includes partial or complete tears of
muscle, ligament and cartilage. While doctors suspect increased
steroid use is associated with the increased incidence of such
injuries among major leaguers, Wooten said he has never used
steroids.</LD>
<TE>   "I've gotten this far without it," he said. "Why would I?"</TE>
<TE>   Wooten, 29, endured eight seasons in the minor leagues, and he
said thoughts of steroids occasionally crept into his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Have I thought about it on a 24-hour bus trip from Moose Jaw to
Green Bay? Yeah," he said. "Is the risk bigger than the reward?
Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   He did say he had used creatine, a controversial but legal
nutritional supplement, for one month while recovering from thumb
surgery this spring. He said he limited his use, concerned about the
potential side effect of dehydration, but said the product
accelerated his rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I put on six or seven pounds of muscle," he said. "I felt 10
times better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, fed up with what they consider repeated acts of
immaturity by pitching prodigy Bobby Jenks, kicked him off their
double-A Arkansas team. General Manager Bill Stoneman said Jenks
would be demoted to an undetermined lower-level team and did not rule
out sending him to rookie ball, the lowest rung in the minors.</TE>
<TE>   Jenks, 21, armed with a 100-mph fastball and ranked as the Angels'
top pitching prospect, was 3-6 with a 4.66 earned-run average at
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with performance," Stoneman said. "We
expect players to conduct themselves in a way that puts them on a
path to the major leagues. We want him to get back on track."</TE>

<HD>Pettitte to Rejoin Yankees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Pettitte made it through his latest rehabilitation start with no
difficulty and is set to return to the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I'm ready," Pettitte said Saturday, one day after his
outing for double-A Norwich of the Eastern League.</LD>
<LD>   "My command has been good and I was able to get my pitch count up.
Is my arm in midseason form yet? Obviously not. But I think it's time
to get going."</LD>
<TE>   Pettitte has been sidelined the last seven weeks with tendinitis
in his left elbow. He made his fourth rehab start Friday night,
yielding one run and two hits in 6 1/3 innings. He threw 82 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw everything," he said. "My velocity last night was the
same in the seventh inning as it was in the first. For me that's a
good sign because when you get fatigued you need to hold your
velocity. I was letting it go and threw some hard cutters."</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte has experienced elbow problems since his first spring
training start March 3. He went 1-1 with a 3.09 earned-run average in
three regular-season starts, the last on April 15.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Joe Torre decided to put Pettitte into the rotation Friday
night at Shea Stadium against the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The news isn't as good for another injured Yankee starter. Orlando
Hernandez complained of more soreness in his upper back after a
throwing session Thursday in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is the tests show nothing that will be a long-term
problem," Torre said. "We just need to get the soreness out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red Sox is scheduled to
return to the club Monday and expects to be activated from the
disabled list, sooner than originally expected.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez has been rehabilitating in Florida since breaking his
finger May 5 when he slid headfirst into home plate and hit his hand
on Seattle catcher Dan Wilson's shinguard. He was supposed to return
to Boston on Friday but missed his flight.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Grady Little said the team has received positive reports
from the doctors in Florida who have been monitoring Ramirez's
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Manny's doing good. He'll join us here Monday and stay with us
until he can play," Little said. "Hopefully, it won't be too long. We
hope he's closer than we've all been thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Little said Ramirez could be back before the team returns from the
next road trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins activated catcher Ramon Castro from the 15-day
disabled list one day after sending infielder Marty Malloy to
triple-A Calgary of the Pacific Coast League. Castro, who went on the
disabled list May 16 because of a strained muscle in his right elbow,
returns to back up Charles Johnson and Mike Redmond.</TE>

<HD>Garcia Doesn't Take Long to Defeat Cubs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Freddy Garcia is doing more with less.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia won his fourth consecutive start and Desi Relaford drove in
three runs as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Chicago Cubs, 4-2,
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia (8-4), who hasn't lost since May 19, shut out the Cubs
until Todd Hundley homered with one out in the seventh.</LD>
<TE>   "At the beginning of the year, he was running into too many deep
counts," catcher Ben Davis said. "He's got too good a stuff to go
that deep. He's got the stuff to go out there and put guys away."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia improved to 6-3 in interleague play. He gave up five hits
in seven innings and lowered his earned-run average to 3.20. He led
the American League in ERA at 3.05 last season, when he was the
winning pitcher in the All-Star game in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he threw 104 pitches, 64 for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "I throw a lot of strikes," Garcia said. "That's the key to be
successful. If you throw a lot of strikes and make a good pitch every
time you go out there, you got a good chance to win a lot of games."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Lou Piniella agreed, saying: "He's gotten on a roll and
we've needed it, believe me. It couldn't have come at a better time
for us. He's really picked it up. He's throwing strikes and getting
ahead of the hitters."</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, the Cubs had the bases loaded with two out. Mariner
pitching coach Bryan Price came out to talk to Garcia, who then got
Fred McGriff to ground out to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners, who lost, 2-0, to rookie Mark Prior Friday night,
took a 3-0 lead against Matt Clement (4-4) in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   After John Olerud singled and Ruben Sierra walked, Relaford
tripled to center field. Davis added a sacrifice fly. The Mariners
made it 4-0 in the fourth when Olerud walked, Sierra doubled and
Relaford hit a sacrifice fly.</TE>

<HD>Piazza's Home Run Caps Rally by Mets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Mike Piazza has hit longer, higher and much more dramatic home runs.
This one, though, was in its own special category.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a freak thing," Piazza said.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza capped New York's seven-run rally in the seventh inning
with a three-run homer off Paul Shuey, and the Mets held on for an
8-6 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Piazza, who didn't start behind the plate because he was still
feeling the effects of dehydration, connected for his 11th homer on
an 0-2 pitch in the seventh off Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey hadn't given up a homer in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw me a nasty curve, then a slider in the dirt," Piazza
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just guessing. Trust me, I was just as surprised as
anybody. I said to myself, 'If he throws me a fastball, I'm not going
to miss it.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was a prime example of why you get three strikes. I started
laughing a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Omar Vizquel homered twice and had five runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-run single in the seventh for the Mets,
who weren't getting clutch hits before they came to Cleveland and
didn't have much success in the first six innings against Chuck
Finley (4-7).</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we were going to get Finley," said Met Manager
Bobby Valentine, who used three pinch-hitters in the seventh and lost
his designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to pull out all the stops. You don't usually use your
whole bench when you play an American League game."</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Griffey of Old Seems Long Gone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is early Friday evening of an interleague weekend in Anaheim, and
Jim Lefebvre, the hitting coach of the Cincinnati Reds, is saying he
is convinced that Ken Griffey Jr. can regain his impact form and "be
the Junior of old."</LD>
<LD>   "There is no question about it, no doubt in my mind," Lefebvre
says.</LD>
<LD>   The reality, of course, is that doubt accompanies every step
Griffey takes as he struggles with leg injuries for a third
consecutive season, the Junior of today knowing in many ways he will
never be the Junior of old, that even if he regains his Hall of Fame
form he can never recapture the carefree persona of his teenage
emergence as a major league superstar.</LD>
<TE>   He is 32, after all, and everyone changes over time.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there have been all those fun-sapping slights, real and
imagined, all those injuries, all those changes in his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   It is early Friday evening when he, too, is talking about all of
this, several hours before doubt would accompany him down the
first-base line as he ran out an infield grounder in the fourth
inning of what would become a 4-3 loss to the Angels, a game he left
after straining the hamstring muscle in his right leg on that run up
the line.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same leg in which a partially torn knee tendon forced
Griffey to miss 41 consecutive games from early April to late May, a
year after a torn left hamstring reduced his 2001 availability to 111
games, two years after hamstring injuries plagued him throughout 2000
and sidelined him for almost all of September.</TE>
<TE>   Now, having only recently returned from the knee injury and still
searching for that Roy Hobbs magic, Griffey is day to day again, and
the doubts are pervasive.</TE>
<TE>   Can he get to 100% and stay there?</TE>
<TE>   Is he paying a price for all those years on the unforgiving
artificial surface of the Seattle Kingdome when, because it all came
so easily, he may not have worked on his conditioning as he should
have, as Lou Piniella, his former manager, suggested in April, when
Griffey went down with the knee injury?</TE>
<TE>   Look, whatever the answers are, however the doubt plays out, it
seems like only a minute ago that Griffey was the best player in
baseball, a natural ebullience characterizing his game, and it hurts
to think that might be gone or diminished, no matter the reason, just
as it hurt to see Griffey sitting on an equipment trunk late Friday
night, icing the new hamstring strain, tears in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He was asked how the leg felt and said, "bad enough."</TE>
<TE>   He was asked about his frustration level and said, "I don't know
what to say. This is what I do, the only thing I know how to do, but
I've gone through this for two ... years now. I just want to play,
that's it."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the tears faded. Griffey ran in the outfield, took
batting practice and might play in today's series finale.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds are fighting for a division title, have a reservoir of
talented young outfielders, and went 25-16 when Griffey missed those
41 games earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, his unavailability solves a lineup logjam.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, this is a Gold Glove center fielder whom Henry Aaron
tabbed as the favorite to break his home-run record, a guy who went
home to Cincinnati having hit 48 or more home runs for four
consecutive seasons and, despite missing almost all of that last
month, hit 40 in the first year of his eight-year contract with the
Reds.</TE>
<TE>   And so now, because his uncertainty makes it a little easier to
fill out the lineup, we're supposed to think the Reds won't be
yearning for the "old Junior" down the stretch when there's no way to
know how all those young outfielders will be performing?</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, scheduled to start in center field, hoping to
build on the home run he had hit against St. Louis on Thursday, his
first of the year and 461st of a career in which he was limited to 22
last year because of the hamstring problems, Griffey sat on that same
equipment trunk and said he is simply trying to get the leg strong
again so he can be the player he has always been, that it isn't a
matter of having anything to prove or reclaiming an artificial crown
as baseball's best player from former Seattle teammate Alex
Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Again, as in almost all Griffey interviews, he would lapse into
that theme of no respect and unrealistic expectations, as if that's
what he feeds off of, and he would again express anger at the recent
poll by a Cincinnati TV station in which 73% of the less than 2,000
respondents said that he should be the outfielder who sits when he is
ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it wasn't very scientific," Griffey said, "but it was a
set-up question. With the team fighting for first place and so many
positive things going on, it should never have been asked. How many
cities would love to have its team in first place?</TE>
<TE>   "People should be having fun and excitement instead of answering
negative questions. Do they remember that I took a discount to come
home and play in Cincinnati?</TE>
<TE>   "Would they have done that to Shawn Green in L.A. or Barry Bonds
in San Francisco?"</TE>
<TE>   This is the way it is with Griffey, who at 32 says "no matter what
I do it isn't good enough" and who can't be expected to sustain the
carefree, cap-backward image of 19 because he is the father of three
now and "we all change" and if people don't always see him smiling
and joking it doesn't mean he doesn't care or loves the game any less
"but how am I supposed to be smiling and joking when I've been hurt
for two years and missed as many games as I have? It's not real fun.
I mean, it's not like I'm going around yelling and screaming, but
what's there to laugh about? The one thing I want is a world
championship, and who knows how long I'm going to play? I have to be
more serious."</TE>
<TE>   In the freeze frame of our mind, the Junior of old looked like he
could play forever. Now, it's one day at a time.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views ...</LD>
<LD>   News: The Milwaukee Brewers select Cecil Fielder's son, Prince, in
the first round of the amateur draft, the seventh overall pick.</LD>
<LD>   Views: The 18-year-old Prince isn't merely a chip off the old
block. At 6 feet and 255 pounds, he's pretty much the whole block.
The word among scouts is that the senior Fielder paid a personal
trainer $40,000 to lower Prince's weight from 300 pounds in the
months before the draft.</LD>
<TE>   Prince produced impressive hitting statistics as a first baseman
at his Florida high school, but some teams think he will have to be
used as a designated hitter as a pro. The Brewers, as Bud Selig and
daughter Wendy certainly know, can't use a DH in the National League,
but scouting director Jack Zduriencik said, "When you're picking
where we were picking, you hope to get the best of something in the
draft. We looked at Prince and said, 'Here's the best bat in the
country and in our estimation the best power guy, let's roll with
it.' "</TE>
<TE>   News: The Toronto Blue Jays fire Buck Martinez as manager and
elevate coach Carlos Tosca to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Carlos Delgado and Raul Mondesi had better make sure their
passports are in order, since both are likely to be traded. General
Manager J.P. Ricciardi continues rebuilding the team with younger,
less expensive players who require more tutelage and leadership.
Ricciardi said they weren't getting that from Martinez, hired by
former GM Gord Ash. Martinez came out of the broadcasting booth to
manage the Jays and was dumped and dumped on by a rookie general
manager who characterized Martinez as "a man perfectly suited to
articulate the essence of baseball but tragically unable to
administer it."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if Buck even knows what his style and philosophy
is," Ricciardi said, "simply because he hasn't had a lot of time to
manage."</TE>
<TE>   News: Barry Bonds hits his 587th home run, passing Frank Robinson
and moving into fourth place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Despite being a rookie of the year, winning a triple crown,
being the only player to receive the most-valuable-player award in
each league and ranking among baseball's most fiercely competitive
players, Robinson has not always received proper recognition, and he
once said: "I don't want people to say Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and
Hank Aaron in one breath, then in the next breath, Frank Robinson. I
want them to say Mantle, Mays, Aaron and Robinson in the same
breath."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, however, had a long talk with Bonds during the San
Francisco Giants' recent visit to Montreal about protecting privacy
and focus amid increasing media attention, and Robinson has taken his
demotion to No. 5 on the home run list with humility, saying, "I kind
of liked being fourth, but sooner or later, especially the way
offense is now, somebody was going to pass me. Barry is an
outstanding player, and I wish him the best. He's going to pass some
other people too."</TE>
<TE>   Only Aaron, at 755; Babe Ruth, at 714, and Mays, at 660, are left.
Can he catch Aaron?</TE>
<TE>   "If he plays long enough, I think he will," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   News: The New York Mets are swept in three games by the Atlanta
Braves and start the weekend with a five-game losing streak and a
29-30 record.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Talk about underachieving. No team underwent a more
extensive and expensive make-over during the winter. No team has been
a bigger disappointment. The Mets are last in the National League in
defense and nearly as bad on offense. Roberto Alomar, Mo Vaughn,
Roger Cedeno and Jeromy Burnitz, among the additions, have all
struggled, and the inevitable fires have started to appear in the New
York tabloids--as well as the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating now, and there's going to be a lot of finger
pointing," catcher Mike Piazza said. "I just want to see where we are
at the end of the year. I'm just curious if we have what it takes to
rebound."</TE>
<TE>   News: Pitcher Matt Harrington is drafted in the 13th round by the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Views: If pride does, indeed, goeth before a fall, Harrington
could be living proof. He was the first-round selection, the seventh
overall pick, of the Colorado Rockies when he came out of Palmdale
High in 2000 as the country's top-rated right-hander among high
school pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   However, he turned down the Rockies' offer of $3.7 million, had a
nasty split with agent Tommy Tanzer, tried to keep sharp by pitching
for the independent St. Paul Saints, hired agent Scott Boras, was
selected in the second round of the 2001 draft by the San Diego
Padres, turned down their offer of $1.25 million, and was pitching
his way back into shape under Steve Yeager and John Curtis with the
Long Beach Breakers of the Western League when selected.</TE>
<TE>   How Boras expects to get more than $1.25 million for a 13th-round
selection isn't clear, but scouting director Dan Jennings said the
Devil Rays will treat Harrington on the basis of his current value
and added, "If he's going to be a major leaguer somewhere at some
point, he's got to open the door and jump in."</TE>
<TE>   News: The San Diego Padres start the weekend, and a dream
interleague matchup with the equally inept Devil Rays, having lost 21
of their last 29 games.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It isn't just the losses, which General Manager Kevin
Towers described as "depressing and embarrassing," but the inability
to stabilize the roster and find help.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres, for example, have used 15 shortstops since winning the
1998 pennant, and 36 pitchers since the start of the 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bruce Bochy said the ineptitude is "starting to border on
the ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "How do you deal with the frustration? Do you go home
and kick the dog? I'm on my third dog this season."</TE>

<HD>It Could Be as Simple as AVP</HD>
<DH>Beach volleyball: New partners Youngs and McPeak are poised
for a second consecutive women's tour victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ledger sure looked good, at least to the casual observer.</LD>
<LD>   Elaine Youngs had plenty of strong finishes on the Assn. of
Volleyball Professionals tour last year with Barbra Fontana,
including two seconds and two thirds.</LD>
<LD>   The one AVP tournament they won together wasn't enough, Youngs
decided, particularly as Fontana battled a back injury heading into
this season.</LD>
<TE>   So Youngs picked up the phone and called Holly McPeak at the end
of April, barely a month before the first AVP tournament. Two of the
top players on the AVP Tour, they had never been on the same side of
the net until Youngs posed the question.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak hardly waited for Youngs to finish when she answered in the
affirmative and a partnership was created, a successful one at that,
further evidenced Saturday at the Hermosa Beach Open.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs handled Pat Keller and Marla O'Hara, 21-9,
21-11, in 28 minutes and then defeated Jen Holdren and Stephanie Cox,
21-10, 21-13, in 31 minutes in a winners' bracket quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs won the Huntington Beach Open two weeks ago,
losing only one game in five matches, but were unhappy with their
overall play and spent practice time this week on serving.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no aces [at Huntington]," Youngs said. "We weren't making
people move. We were serving right to them, not getting them in
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Against Keller and O'Hara on Saturday, Youngs had six aces.
Problem solved.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs play Carrie Busch and Leanne Schuster in a
semifinal today. Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis play Fontana
and Dianne DeNecochea in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their brief tenure as a team, McPeak and Youngs have
become overwhelming favorites on the AVP tour, partly because Misty
May and Kerri Walsh, another top U.S. duo, are playing solely on the
international tour.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs play next weekend at Santa Barbara, then head to
Gstaad, Switzerland, for their first international event.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be a test," Youngs said. "But if Holly and I keep playing
and practicing the way we have been, we'll be tough to beat."</TE>
<TE>   In the men's tournament, seventh-seeded Karch Kiraly and Brent
Doble surprised No. 2 Dax Holdren and Eric Fonoimoana, 19-21, 21-13,
15-11, in a winners' quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly, 41, continued to play well since coming off a heel injury
that kept him sidelined for all but two AVP tournaments last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble halted an eight-match winning streak by Holdren
and Fonoimoana, who went 6-0 on the way to the Huntington Beach
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fun win," said Kiraly, who tied for third at Huntington
Beach. "All the other teams had been out there to give them their
first defeat."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble will play Albert Hannemann and Jeff Nygaard in a
winners' semifinal today. Top-seeded Stein Metzger and Kevin Wong
play Scott Ayakatubby and Brian Lewis in the other semifinal.</TE>

<HD>Triple Frown for Baffert</HD>
<DH>A stumbling start for War Emblem, a stunning finish for
70-1 Sarava</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>These guys with crutches are just too much for trainer Bob Baffert
and his undying quest for a Triple Crown.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago, Elliott Walden, on crutches after suffering a
sandlot basketball injury, still saddled Victory Gallop to beat
Baffert's Real Quiet in the Belmont Stakes. Baffert came back for
more this year with War Emblem, but that Kentucky Derby-Preakness
winner caved in Saturday, in a Belmont won by the previously
undistinguished Sarava and trainer Ken McPeek, another sometime
basketballer who ditched his crutches only a few weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like Elliott Walden without the crutches," a still hobbled
McPeek said after Sarava's shocker, which produced the biggest win
payoff ($142.50) in the 134 runnings of the Belmont. "If I still had
mine, I would have raised them in a 'V' today."</LD>
<TE>   Before the Belmont, Baffert had said that the only thing that
could beat War Emblem in the 1 1/2-mile marathon would be a bad
beginning, and the second step out of the gate almost deep-sixed the
colt and jockey Victor Espinoza. War Emblem stumbled badly, found
himself in fourth place instead of being on or near the lead, and
although he made the lead for a few strides with half a mile to go,
this was not Churchill Downs or Pimlico. A Belmont Park crowd of
103,222--a record for the track and also believed to be the largest
turnout for a New York sports event--turned to one giant hush when
Sarava and jockey Edgar Prado stormed down the stretch to beat
Medaglia d'Oro by a half-length in 2:29 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, the 6-5 favorite, struggled home eighth in the
11-horse field, beaten by 19 1/2 lengths in the worst race of his
career. Instead of becoming the 12th Triple Crown champion, and the
first since Affirmed in 1978, Prince Ahmed bin Salman's colt became
the 16th Derby-Preakness winner to fail and the fourth in the last
six years. Baffert also fell one race short with Silver Charm in
1997. War Emblem could have earned a $5-million Triple Crown bonus
with a Belmont win.</TE>
<TE>   The prince, who had planned to attend the Belmont, on Friday told
Richard Mulhall, the general manager of his Thoroughbred Corp., that
"family obligations" would prevent him from being here. Salman was
represented by his younger brother, Prince Faisal bin Salman.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if security considerations at Belmont might have been the
reason for Ahmed bin Salman's absence, Mulhall said: "He wouldn't
have his brother here if that were the case. He was very, very
disappointed that he couldn't be here."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert said he felt bad for Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just bad racing luck," the trainer said. "When my horse
stumbled, I knew it was way too much for the poor guy to overcome. I
am very disappointed. The fans didn't get a chance to see the real
War Emblem. His one chink in the armor is if he breaks slow and is in
behind horses, he's not at his best. I'm going to reload and
hopefully come back next year."</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza said War Emblem, breaking from the No. 9 stall and the
third-last horse to be loaded into the gate, was standing perfectly
while waiting for the start.</TE>
<TE>   "The first jump, he was all right," Espinoza said. "But the second
jump, he bobbled. He almost fell down before he got started up again.
But after that there was nothing. We had to sit behind horses. I
dropped inside, but I had lost everything at the start. I lost
everything there. Then I had to wait as much as I could. I didn't
want to use my horse too early."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Niall O'Callaghan, whose Wiseman's Ferry finished ninth
after leading for the opening half-mile, explained how a dicey start
can affect a horse.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine how much adrenaline a start like War Emblem's
can take out of a horse. It just sucks the adrenaline right out of
them, and it takes them a while to pick it up again. It's like if
you're driving a car and run into something. Your whole system shuts
off for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break finished third, but 9 1/2 lengths behind Medaglia
d'Oro. After them came Magic Weisner, Proud Citizen, Essence Of
Dubai, Like A Hero, War Emblem, Wiseman's Ferry, Perfect Drift and
Artax Too. Proud Citizen needed to be vanned back to his barn after
the race. X-rays showed that he cracked his front left shin. Trainer
Wayne Lukas said that he will be sidelined about four months.</TE>
<TE>   Sarava and Medaglia d'Oro, who was 16-1, combined for a $2 exacta
worth $2,454. The $2 trifecta on the first three finishers paid
$25,209, and a ticket on the first four across the line was good for
$145,334.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Belmont, McPeek had had a gut-wrenching week. On
Tuesday, he learned that Harlan's Holiday, winner of the Florida
Derby and the Blue Grass but seventh as the Derby favorite and then
fourth in the Preakness, was being transferred to trainer Todd
Pletcher. A sharp workout by Sarava the same day--four furlongs in
:48 3/5--was not enough to temper the loss, but McPeek still entered
Saturday's race quietly confident, because he thought his horse was
peaking and War Emblem was vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "War Emblem looked like he was tailing off," McPeek said. "His
[speed] numbers dropped off from the Derby to the Preakness, and when
that happens, it can mean that a horse is eligible to run worse the
next time. What's the old line? Horses are like strawberries, because
they can go bad any time."</TE>
<TE>   Then when War Emblem almost went down, McPeek saw another reason
for beating him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a horse that wants nothing to do with dirt hitting him in
the face," McPeek said. "I thought he might be in trouble with the
stumble. That cost him the race in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   Sarava was sixth after the first half-mile. With Wisemen's Ferry
fading, Medaglia d'Oro took over the lead approaching the half-mile
pole and Sarava, running on the inside, moved up to fourth. At the
quarter pole, he was in third, just over a half-length back of
Medaglia d'Oro and Proud Citizen. Espinoza was whipping War Emblem
furiously, but getting no response.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time Prado had ridden him, in the 1 1/16-mile Sir
Barton Stakes on the Preakness undercard, Sarava won by four lengths.
The Belmont was the Wild Again-Rhythm Of Life colt's first start in a
graded stake.</TE>
<TE>   The big number on the odds board didn't discourage Prado.</TE>
<TE>   "I never gave up on him," said Prado, a Peruvian native who turns
35 Wednesday. "As much as I wish a Triple Crown might help the racing
business, I'm also in this game to win. That's what we get paid for.
In the jocks' room, I have a lot of friends. But you get out to the
track and you have no friends."</TE>

<HD>It's Tough to Put a Price on This Win</HD>
<DH>Belmont: Co-owner tried to sell friends a piece of Sarava
but found no takers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The career of the winner of the 134th Belmont Stakes began in
England, at tracks such as Sandown, Lingfield and Doncaster.</LD>
<LD>   That was when Sarava was a 2-year-old. Susan and Paul Roy, a
couple from Surrey, England, had bought the Kentucky-bred at auction
for $250,000 before he raced. After three starts in England--races in
which he was beaten by a combined 29 1/2 lengths--the Roys sent him
to a Kentucky-based trainer, Ken McPeek, and brought in Gary Drake of
Louisville as a 50-50 partner.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a few friends that may be jumping off a bridge about now,"
Drake said after Sarava's improbable win in Saturday's Belmont. "I
had offered them a piece of this horse, but they weren't interested."</LD>
<TE>   Sarava's Belmont was worth $600,000, for a horse that had earned
only $96,851 going into the race. He has now run nine races at eight
tracks, winning three and finishing second three times.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek, whose top two horses for the Triple Crown had been
Harlan's Holiday and Repent, hadn't thought of Sarava as a Belmont
horse as recently as three weeks ago. But Drake urged him to run the
colt in the $79,000 Sir Barton Stakes at Pimlico on Preakness day,
and after that the Belmont became more of a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Harlan's Holiday was a bust in the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness, and Repent was injured in the Illinois Derby.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek had started Pineaff in the 1999 Belmont, and suffered
through a ninth-place disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't bring the horse to New York until late," McPeek said.
"He ran embarrassingly bad, but I came away with a nugget: The next
time I was going to run a horse in the Belmont, I'd give him plenty
of time to acclimate to the track."</TE>
<TE>   Sarava was flown to New York last weekend, a few days before War
Emblem and some other Belmont horses.</TE>
<TE>   Sarava paid $142.50, a Belmont record, for a $2 win bet. The day
he broke his maiden, at Churchill Downs in November of last year, he
paid $75.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, I was pinching myself when he won today," McPeek said.
"This is a horse that was 20 stalls down from my two good ones at
Churchill Downs. But I've always liked this horse. He had a great hip
when I first saw him, and he's got a long stride and a great turn of
foot."</TE>
<TE>   For several months, McPeek and his blacksmiths--Bruce Scott and
Bob Brummett--battled a cracked hoof on the inside of Sarava's front
foot. When Drake was e-mailed grisly photos of the hoof, he said:
"Oh, my God."</TE>
<TE>   "[Brummett] had worked on Cigar's feet, and he said that Sarava's
foot was worse than any of his," McPeek said. "He's got the worst
foot of any horse I've ever trained. They carved away one-third of
the foot at one point, and he still runs with a [protective] patch."</TE>
<TE>   When Sarava surged to the front in the Belmont, Drake wasn't sure
he was watching his horse. But then he turned to his trainer in the
box seats and a screaming McPeek said: "We're gonna win it!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pleasant County, a 4-year-old filly, suffered a fatal skull injury
in a two-horse spill in the fourth race at Belmont. The other horse
in the accident, Imadeed, was vanned off the track with fractures of
both sesamoid bones in her right front leg.</TE>
<TE>   John Velazquez, who rode Imadeed, reinjured a knee that he hurt in
a Friday spill. Not scheduled to ride in the Belmont, Velazquez took
off the rest of his mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Eibar Coa, who rode Pleasant County, was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other stakes at Belmont, Beat Hollow, ridden by Alex Solis for
trainer Bobby Frankel and one of only two favorites to win on the
12-race card, beat Forbidden Apple by two lengths in the $400,000
Manhattan Handicap; Explicit, also favored, won the $250,000 True
North Handicap; Gygistar was the winner of the $200,000 Riva Ridge
Stakes; and Babae beat Tates Creek by a neck in the $200,000 Just A
Game Handicap.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Might Be in League of Its Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With favored France, Argentina and Italy each having been beaten once
already in this tournament, Brazil served notice Saturday that it
will be anything but easy to deny it a record fifth World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the opposition was only China, but the way in which the
Brazilians dismantled the Chinese defense en route to a 4-0 victory
in front of 36,750 fans in Seogwipo, South Korea, was impressive and
intimidating.</LD>
<LD>   This might not be the finest Brazilian team ever, but its strike
force ranks with the best.</LD>
<TE>   All the same, it was defender Roberto Carlos, arguably the world's
top left back, who first cracked the Chinese wall with a thunderous
free kick in the 15th minute. The left-foot shot from 25 yards was in
the back of the net before goalkeeper Jiang Jin had time to realize
that his defenders had left too large a gap in their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Carlos blasted the ball through that gap and it was all
downhill from there for the Chinese as Brazil's "Triple R" line took
command.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldinho chipped a cross from the left flank into the goal box
in the 32nd minute, and Rivaldo surged in to side-foot the ball past
the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 in Brazil's favor.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds before halftime it became 3-0 when Ronaldo was pulled down
in the penalty area by defender Du Wei and Ronaldinho stepped up to
score on a penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo completed the scoring in the 55th minute, latching on to a
pass from Cafu and beating Jiang from close range. It was Ronaldo's
second goal of the tournament and led him to suggest that more will
be coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe I can now score a goal in every match," he said. "I
feel great."</TE>
<TE>   The closest China came to scoring was when Zhao Junzhe came within
inches of netting China's first World Cup goal, only to watch in
dismay as his curling shot clanged against the right post.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the defeat, China's second in a row after an earlier 2-0
loss to Costa Rica, Coach Bora Milutinovic praised his players for
their effort against the experienced and talented Brazilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud of my players," he said. "It is a strange feeling.
When you lose, it is not good, but we were playing a strong Brazil
team. For us it was very important to play well. I am very happy with
my players; they did everything they could."</TE>

<LD>Here's a rule that Laker Coach Phil Jackson could support.</LD>
<LD>   Southeastern Conference university presidents recently voted to
penalize the home team if fans use artificial noisemakers during
football games. The rule is aimed at Mississippi State fans and their
beloved cowbells.</LD>
<LD>   But Bulldog Coach Jackie Sherrill has vowed to keep the cowbells
ringing.</LD>
<TE>   Sherrill said he wants the university to pipe in the sound of
cowbells through the stadium's sound system. Piped-in music and sound
effects are allowed during pregame, halftime, timeouts and after
scoring plays.</TE>
<TE>   "We will take care of the cowbell issue," Sherrill said. "We will
have cowbell sounds in the stadium that are louder than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   Where is this guy from, Sacramento?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only major league player to be active when
Babe Ruth retired and when Hank Aaron broke in?</TE>
<TE>   Hard-hearted: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post says the
Lakers know what it takes to be champions because they've had their
hearts broken in the past:</TE>
<TE>   "Remember all those times Shaq got swept out of the playoffs?
Remember Kobe's air-ball bonanza at the end of an elimination game a
few years back? It's been a long time, but don't forget that Phil
Jackson's Bulls lost a Game 7 in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "The making of a champion, the development of toughness in the
clutch, clear thinking under stress, and grace under pressure hardly
ever happen without first experiencing crushing defeat leading to
soul searching."</TE>
<TE>   Travelin' man: Shaquille O'Neal, asked if he had visited the
Parthenon during a trip to Greece, replied, "I can't really remember
the names of the clubs that we went to."</TE>
<TE>   Scientific saves: Goalkeepers at the World Cup can improve their
chances of saving penalty shots by reading visual clues given
subconsciously by penalty-kick shooters, according to scientists from
Britain's Greenwich University.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that goaltenders should watch the angle of the
kicker's shoulders and his standing leg for clues as to the direction
of the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Outcasts: Filip Bondy of the New York Daily News says, for the
most part, it isn't easy being an American soccer fan:</TE>
<TE>   "It takes considerable initiative. The scores aren't on the TV
sportscasts. So you go to the Web. The neighbor doesn't want to talk
about the beautiful sport at all. So there is a chat room, or maybe
the soccer moms in the park."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: First baseman Phil Cavarretta, who played from 1934
to 1955. Ruth retired in 1935; Aaron made his debut in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, with some
satirical commentary on the latest baseball scandal:</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I ought to confess. I take steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been taking them for years, throwing them down like M&amp;Ms.
Truthfully, I take so much juice, my nickname is 'V8.'</TE>
<TE>   "I take steroids to get bigger, stronger, faster on the keyboard.
You should see me type now. I'm unbelievably fast, yet precise at the
same time. I'm the Eric Clapton of the laptop. I can type all of
'Moby Dick' in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can type it faster than Evelyn Wood can read it!"</TE>

<HD>Stanford Eliminates USC, 5-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>If there was one thing USC could count on in a strange season, it was
that its batters would wake up at any time and overpower an opponent.
The Trojans scored 10 runs or more on 20 occasions. They won 19 of
those games, a big reason why they beat Stanford for the Pacific 10
Conference championship.</LD>
<LD>   But this was the NCAA super regional at Stanford against a team
that is dominant at home. That was the case Saturday as the
frustrated Trojans ended their season in a 5-3 loss to the Cardinal
at Sunken Diamond.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a week ago, USC (37-24) had 21 hits in a
regional-clinching 13-10 victory over Brigham Young. The Trojans
managed only 11 hits in two super regional games against Stanford.</LD>
<TE>   "Generally, good pitching beats good hitting," USC center fielder
Brian Barre said. "That's what happened this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   With the Trojans not hitting, they couldn't afford to slip in
other areas. But their defense failed in the sixth, spoiling a solid
outing by junior left-hander Cory Campos.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Jon Brewster tried to get Ryan Garko on a slow
roller, but his throw sailed over first baseman Bill Peavey's head
and Garko reached second base. Campos, who gave up only one earned
run in 6 1/3 innings, induced another ground ball, but Peavey booted
it to let Jason Cooper reach base.</TE>
<TE>   Campos walked Carlos Quentin and fell behind Scott Dragicevich,
who lined a 3-and-1 pitch to right-center field to score Garko and
Cooper, and give Stanford a 3-2 lead. Dragicevich had four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin scored on a single by Brian Hall and Dragicevich scored on
a single by Andy Topham, putting the Cardinal (45-16) on course for
its 29th home victory in 33 games and fourth consecutive appearance
in the College World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Gillespie was bothered that Stanford's rally came with
two out.</TE>
<TE>   "They're certainly a club that you have to match pitch for pitch
and play for play," Gillespie said. "You have to play well. If you
give them a couple of extra outs to work with, well they're certainly
a club that's capable of doing what they did."</TE>
<TE>   Brewster tripled with one out in the fifth inning and scored on
Barre's single for a 2-1 lead. But Tim Cunningham (10-2) got Alberto
Concepcion, the Pac-10 player of the year, to ground into a double
play.</TE>
<TE>   A two-out double by Michael Moon knocked out Cunningham in the
sixth, but Ryan McCally retired pinch-hitter Kris Cox on a fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Peavey walked with one out, but Joey Metropolous
and Moon struck out looking against McCally and Dan Rich, who pitched
the final 1 1/3 innings for his fifth save.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolous and Concepcion, who combined for 113 runs batted in
this season, were a combined 0 for 15 with seven strikeouts in the
super regional.</TE>

<LD>The new kids on the block, Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, believe they
have identified the bullies and they're not going to keep quiet about
it.</LD>
<LD>   "If you are an African team, you don't get the same treatment as
the bigger, better-known teams," said Cameroon Coach Winfried
Schaefer, a native of Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Schaefer said Saturday that FIFA and Japan's organizing committee
had shown favoritism toward Germany, which Cameroon plays Tuesday in
Shizuoka. As the home team, Cameroon would normally choose its final
training time at the stadium the night before the match. However,
when Schaefer said he requested a 7 p.m. practice, the soccer
governing body told him that Cameroon would have to train 30 minutes
later to suit Germany.</LD>
<TE>   "Against Saudi Arabia we were the home team, so we got to choose
first," defender Raymond Kallas said. "So why shouldn't it be the
same with Germany? It just doesn't correspond to the rules and it's
unjust."</TE>
<TE>   There have been incidents during the games, too.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, Cameroon had a goal nullified
for offside, but television replays showed the play was legal.
Schaefer also felt Daniel Ngom Kome was fouled in the penalty area 30
seconds into the match. But the referee didn't give one.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a global problem," Schaefer said. "Just look at yellow
cards. It's so much easier for referees to give African players
yellow cards. Do you ever see African players moan to the referee
like the European or South American players do just because they
don't accept his call?"</TE>

<LD>British bookmakers lost millions of dollars to patriotic soccer fans
Friday following England's 1-0 defeat of Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   Bookies slashed England's odds of winning the tournament minutes
after the match. Ladbrokes reduced England's odds from 16-1 to 7-1,
while William Hill cut them from 14-1 to 8-1.</LD>
<LD>   "We made England the underdogs for this game, but [bettors]
refused to contemplate defeat," Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said.
"We're now in the process of paying out literally hundreds of
thousands of winning bets."</LD>
<TE>   Italy remains an 11-4 favorite with Ladbrokes, followed by Brazil

<HD>Schilling Simply Too Tough</HD>
<DH>Interleague: He outpitches Martinez to defeat the Red Sox,
3-2, and improve his record to 12-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Baseball's winningest pitcher had his way with baseball's winningest
team.</LD>
<LD>   Curt Schilling and the Arizona Diamondbacks handed Pedro Martinez
his first loss, beating the Boston Red Sox, 3-2, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Both guys really battled," Diamondback Manager Bob Brenly said.
"I'd venture to guess that neither one of them felt that he had his
best stuff. But that just shows you the caliber of pitchers they
are."</LD>
<TE>   Schilling (12-1) yielded six hits and two walks over 7 1/3
innings, striking out nine to improve his major league-leading
victory total.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox lost their fourth consecutive home game and are only
15-13 at Fenway Park--no match for their 25-6 road record but still
better than the 0-2 mark with a 7.50 earned-run average that
Schilling had posted in his previous five games at Fenway with the
Baltimore Orioles and Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never pitched well here. They've always had a good lineup,"
Schilling said. "I had good stuff. Good enough. But I don't feel like
I was ever in a groove today."</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim got the final four outs to earn his 16th save,
striking out Lou Merloni with a runner on third to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kim has saved both games in Arizona's first-ever visit to Fenway
Park, where Schilling took the loss when he faced Martinez in the
1999 All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (7-1) struck out the first four batters in that game and
was selected the most valuable player, but he overextended himself in
the effort and went on the disabled list before returning to win his
first of two American League Cy Young Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's performance wasn't nearly as dominant, raising
questions again his health. He didn't win a game after May last year
because of a frayed rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez retired nine in a row at one point--five of them on
strikeouts--but he struggled at other times and needed 115 pitches to
get through six innings.</TE>
<TE>   In all, he gave up three runs and seven hits, walked two and
struck out 10 as Boston fell to 40-19--the best record in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling gave up a first-inning homer to Carlos Baerga and four
singles before running into trouble in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Merloni led off with a single off third baseman Craig Counsell's
glove, then Schilling, who had gone 44 innings and 165 batters
without giving up a walk, walked Johnny Damon.</TE>
<TE>   After Baerga's sacrifice bunt, Nomar Garciaparra walked and Mike
Myers relieved. Shortstop Tony Womack mishandled Tony Clark's
grounder before grabbing the ball to make the throw to second.
Garciaparra appeared to beat the throw in a close play, but he was
ruled out by umpire Brian O'Nora. Merloni scored on the play to make
it 3-2.</TE>

<HD>Ishii's Latest Win Isn't Jam-Packed</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander avoids trouble after first inning,
and Dodgers beat Orioles, 8-4, for rookie's 10th victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy is still waiting for that elusive game in
which Kazuhisa Ishii puts everything together, when the left-hander
shuts down an opponent for eight or nine innings, walks one or two
and is never in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't happen Saturday night, but Ishii provided a five-inning
glimpse of what such a game would be like, thoroughly dominating a
weak Baltimore Oriole lineup from the second through sixth innings to
lead the Dodgers to an 8-4 interleague victory before 39,489 in
Camden Yards.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Green pulled the Dodgers even, 3-3, in the third with a
two-run home run, a 410-foot blast that was his 14th homer of the
season and first since May 27, and Mark Grudzielanek put the game out
of reach with a two-run homer in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   Ishii gave up four runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings, striking
out four and issuing a season-low two walks, to improve to 10-1 and
become the ninth pitcher in major league history to begin his rookie
season with a 10-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   And he didn't need a safety net to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii has been a high-wire act this season, struggling with his
rhythm and control to such a degree he ranks third in the National
League with 46 walks. He's created numerous jams, causing Tracy to
rock back and forth or pace the dugout nervously, but he's also made
big pitches in big situations to escape trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night began like another typical Ishii outing. After
retiring the first two batters and getting ahead of Gary Matthews,
0-and-2, Ishii walked Matthews, gave up a single to Jeff Conine and a
three-run homer to Tony Batista.</TE>
<TE>   But Tracy's heart rate barely rose above normal for the next five
innings, as Ishii faced a minimum 15 batters, walked one and struck
out four. He gave up two singles in the fourth, but Conine was thrown
out by left fielder Marquis Grissom trying to stretch his hit into a
double, and Batista was picked off first.</TE>
<TE>   A sure sign of progress: Ishii, who had a 52-pitch inning against
Pittsburgh on April 23, needed three pitches to retire the side in
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't rock, and I didn't walk quite so much in the dugout,"
Tracy said. "That was the best five consecutive innings he's pitched
since his first start. They scored three in the first, and after
that, it was just over with. He created no opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii has perplexed many this season, looking like a confused
rookie one inning and a staff ace the next. He always seems to be one
pitch away from being pulled or from giving up a huge inning, and
then he'll freeze a batter with a roundhouse curve or snap hook or
sneak a fastball by a hitter looking for something off speed.</TE>
<TE>   "He never gives in," Grissom said. "He's like [Atlanta left-hander
Tom] Glavine that way. That makes it tough for hitters, because they
can't sit on any one pitch. He has good poise, he doesn't get upset,
and that's what you need in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, 28, went 78-46 for the Yakult Swallows during a 10-year
career in Japan, but he said Saturday night was the first time since
signing with the Dodgers this winter that he felt like himself.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time I felt like I did when I pitched well in
Japan, the first time I returned to that form," Ishii said through an
interpreter. "The main thing is I was able to spot my fastball on the
outside part of the plate. That's when I'm pitching at my best."</TE>
<TE>   Good run support doesn't hurt. Ishii has benefited from the
fifth-best support in the National League, with the Dodgers averaging
5.96 runs per nine innings behind him, and they had 11 hits in their
eight-run attack Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers snapped a 3-3 tie with an unearned run in the fourth,
when Adrian Beltre reached on an error, stole second, took third on a
groundout and scored on Cesar Izturis' grounder for a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Two more Dodger runs in the seventh made it 6-3, as Grudzielanek
doubled to right, Dave Roberts tripled to right and Paul Lo Duca, who
had three hits, grounded an RBI single to center. The Orioles scored
in the seventh to make it 6-4, but Grudzielanek's fourth homer of the
season in the eighth made it 8-4.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's victory was secured, but his preseason goal of winning 12
games was looking a little flimsy. He could have 12 wins by the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   What will Ishii do when he collects his 12th win? "At that time,"
he said, "I'll have a new goal."</TE>

<HD>They Still Like Hand, Even Without Ace</HD>

<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>With pitcher Kevin Brown sidelined indefinitely because of a
herniated disk in his lower back and inflammation in his surgically
repaired right elbow, the Dodgers must come to grips with the
possibility of being without their ace for a significant amount of
time.</LD>
<LD>   They've survived Brown-out conditions so far--they're 36-25
despite getting only five quality starts from Brown, who has been on
the disabled list twice. The Dodgers are 18-7 with Brown on the
disabled list and 18-18 with him on the active roster.</LD>
<LD>   But can the Dodgers reach the playoffs or win the National League
pennant without Brown? Can a rotation of Hideo Nomo, Andy Ashby,
Odalis Perez, Kazuhisa Ishii and Omar Daal, a deep and talented staff
that lacks a dominating No. 1, keep the Dodgers in contention?</LD>
<TE>   "We've got six aces," outfielder Marquis Grissom said. "We have a
good pitching staff. I don't care if Kevin Brown is out all year,
he's still our ace, the guy, come playoff and World Series time, you
want on the mound. But we still have other guys who can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Seattle Mariners of 2001 and the Atlanta Braves of the
1990s, the Dodger rotation seems built for the long haul. But unless
Brown returns to the form that made him one of baseball's most
effective pitchers, they might have trouble matching up against teams
with dominant aces.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it would be nice to have a Randy Johnson-Curt Schilling
tandem," Manager Jim Tracy said. "In the meantime, I like my chances
every day I write one of those names in the ninth or 10th spot [in
the order]. We're 11 games over .500 ... so you have to be satisfied,
especially considering your ace isn't healthy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   National League managers often take advantage of the designated
hitter in American League parks to give position players a break,
figuring a game in which a regular doesn't have to play defense is as
good as a game off. Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan, who has a
nagging left knee injury, was the DH Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   But Tracy said he will not use first baseman Eric Karros in that
capacity against the Orioles and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, whom the
Dodgers will face in a three-game series beginning Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Karros went hitless in six at-bats as a DH in 1998 and had one hit
in four at-bats as a DH in 2000. He discussed that performance with
Tracy before interleague play began, and the manager decided to keep
Karros at first base in AL parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had any success as a DH--I just don't feel like I'm in
the game," Karros said. "It's a tough job to do, the same as
pinch-hitting. It's not as easy as it appears. It's something you
have to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a catcher who plays outfield or first base for a game;
unless you have experience doing it, you're going to be exposed. It's
not just going up there and hitting. It's just as important what
you're doing between at-bats."</TE>

<HD>Lewis Takes a Bite Out of Tyson Myth</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Champion controls fight, then stops it with
knockout in eighth. Tyson goes without incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MEMPHIS, Tenn.--He lay there on his back on the canvas of the Pyramid
Saturday night, his right glove over his face, briefly hiding the
swollen eyes, the deep cuts in the eyebrows, the streams of blood,
the battered nose, hiding them from the crowd of 15,327 and a
worldwide audience of more than a million.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing could hide the fact that beneath the bravado, behind
the bully, at the core of the arrogance and profanity, Mike Tyson, at
age 35, was a shot fighter.</LD>
<LD>   At the end, after Lennox Lewis dominated and ultimately knocked
out Tyson to defend his International Boxing Federation/World Boxing
Council heavyweight title, Tyson, who built up an image as a monster
of mayhem in the ring, was a pitiful figure.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis was in control from the second round on, knocked Tyson down
in the eighth round and then finished Tyson off with a head-rattling
roundhouse right hand that finished the fight at the 2:25 mark of
that round.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my defining fight the whole world wanted to see," Lewis
said. "I wanted to complete my legacy as the best fighter on the
planet. I showed boxing who is the best in the world."</TE>
<TE>   In defeat, Tyson may have gained the respect he could never get as
a two-time heavyweight champion. The man who bit both of Evander
Holyfield's ears in their 1997 title match, who bit Lewis on the
upper left thigh at a January news conference, who tried to break
Francois Botha's arm in a 1999 fight, was humble and gracious in
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson had nothing left after winning the first round with his
aggressiveness and solid left hands. Although the 6-foot-5 Lewis
enjoyed a height advantage of 5 1/2 inches, a weight advantage of 15
pounds and a reach advantage of six inches, he was giving Tyson the
edge, a dangerous edge, by allowing him inside.</TE>
<TE>   But after some quick and furious instructions from trainer Emanuel
Steward in the corner, Lewis came out in the second round a different
man.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Alfred Bukwana, Bob Logist and Anak Hongtonkan each gave
Tyson the first round, but none of the others.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis used his size advantage to keep Tyson at bay and smacked him
with jab after jab after jab.</TE>
<TE>   The only problems Lewis had in the ring came not from Tyson, but
from the third man in the ring, referee Eddie Cotton.</TE>
<TE>   After Lewis appeared to knock Tyson down in the fourth round,
Cotton ruled instead that Lewis had pushed Tyson down, penalizing him
a point. That cost Lewis two points. Instead of getting a 10-8 round,
Lewis had a settle for a 9-9 round after the deduction.</TE>
<TE>   No problem. Lewis calmly went to work in the fifth round, reducing
Tyson's face to a bloody pulp.</TE>
<TE>   "Emanuel told me to take him out earlier," Lewis said. "He was
pleading with me. But I was biding my time."</TE>
<TE>   A cut over Tyson's right eye opened up in the third round. Lewis'
glove split Tyson's left eye in the fifth. His nose bled on and off.
And as the rounds proceeded, the swelling gradually reduced Tyson's
eyes to slits.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed time for Tyson to find a way out, an illegal way if
necessary. Many waited for the inevitable bite, or low blow, or
rabbit punch, or late hit.</TE>
<TE>   But it never came</TE>
<TE>   "This was the guy that bit me and I decided he was going to get
some discipline," said Lewis, who improved to 40-2-1 with 31
knockouts. "I wasn't going to give him a reason to bite. I felt he
behaved himself because everyone was watching."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't it at all, according to Tyson, who dropped to 49-4
with two no-contests and 43 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows me," Tyson said. "I love him. He knows I respect him. I
love him too much to do anything to disrespect him."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis put Tyson down for the first time in the eighth round with a
vicious left uppercut, followed by a short right hand. Cotton stepped
in to count although Tyson was still in a crouch.</TE>
<TE>   When the fight resumed, Lewis came back with the roundhouse right
that sent him tumbling to the canvas. Tyson weakly made it to his
feet, slumped against the ropes as the count ran out.</TE>
<TE>   But afterward, Tyson didn't rant or rave or storm from the ring.
He stayed around to congratulate Lewis, kiss Lewis' mother, Violet,
and ask for a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you for the chance," Tyson told Lewis. "Nobody wanted to
give me a chance. I am thankful you gave me a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Then Tyson told reporters, "I am happy for him and I hope he gives
me a fight one more time."</TE>
<TE>   It's a fight few would want to see. Lewis connected on 59% of his
punches to 23% for Tyson. In jabs thrown, the difference was even
more pronounced, 53% for Lewis and just 15% for Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, International Boxing Federation junior
featherweight champion Manny Pacquiao (34-2-1, 25 knockouts) of the
Philippines defended his title by stopping Jorge Eliecer Julio (44-4,
32) of Colombia at 1:09 of the second round. And in a non-title
match, Joel Casamayor (27-1, 17)) stopped Juan Jose Arias (33-3-1,
27) at 1:44 of the eighth round.</TE>

<HD>The Reign of Spain Still Hasn't Ended in Paris</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Ferrero and Costa today will play the third
all-Spanish men's final at the French Open in the last eight years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Argentina was supposed to be the new Spain--producing a younger,
stronger, faster generation of clay-courters.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, the old Spain wasn't ready to be moved aside, at
least at Roland Garros. Three Spaniards landed in the final four at
the French Open, and two are in today's final, 11th-seeded Juan
Carlos Ferrero and Albert Costa. It will be the first Grand Slam
final for both.</LD>
<LD>   This makes three all-Spanish finals at the French Open in the last
eight years. In 1998, Carlos Moya defeated Alex Corretja in three
sets, and Sergi Bruguera beat Alberto Berasategui in four sets in
1994.</LD>
<TE>   "There is only one match left here," Costa said. "You have to
fight to the death in order to win."</TE>
<TE>   Of the top Spaniards, the 26-year-old Costa is quite likely the
least known. The glamorous Moya has his own cologne line and finds
his picture in glossy Spanish gossip magazines. Corretja twice has
reached the French Open final, and is known for losing to Pete
Sampras at the 1996 U.S. Open and, more recently, beating Sampras on
grass in Houston this year in Davis Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, 22, is the hope of the future, maybe even the present,
and much has been expected of him, as he lost to eventual champion
Gustavo Kuerten the last two years here. His nickname is Mosquito.</TE>
<TE>   Costa? Well, he once asked to be called Albert, instead of
Alberto.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Al is good," he said. "I've been playing a long time [since
1994]. I don't know if I'm more famous or not. I'm trying to do my
job every day, trying to run. I play, play, play."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero and Costa have played four times, all on clay, and Costa
won their only match this year, last month in Hamburg, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   In this tournament, Costa has had one five-set match, beating
Guillermo Canas of Argentina in the quarterfinals. Ferrero needed
five sets against Nicolas Coutelot of France in the second round and
Gaston Gaudio of Argentina in the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero had his doubts earlier in the tournament after spraining
his right ankle the day before his second-round match. He needed
injections to move forward and didn't appear to be moving freely
until his quarterfinal win over Andre Agassi and Marat Safin in the
semifinals. Costa, however, presents, a different challenge. They are
countrymen and appear to be close.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very solid player," Ferrero said. "It's difficult to drive
him out of the court. It's almost as if he had a fan behind him. It's
difficult to make him lose but I'm going to try."</TE>

<HD>Breaking News: It's Serena</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She beats sister Venus in ragged French Open final
with 101 errors, 13 service breaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Only the most optimistic soul would have shown up at Roland Garros
expecting a classic French Open final between sisters Venus and
Serena Williams. One could always hope, or is that dream?</LD>
<LD>   A decent match would have been fine, under the blanket of lowered
expectations, but that remained an elusive commodity Saturday, when
Serena beat her older sister for the first time in a Grand Slam
event, 7-5, 6-3, in 1 hour 32 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Serena, who became the first African American woman to win here
since Althea Gibson in 1956, rallied from a 5-3 first-set deficit and
fought off two break points in the 12th game to prevent a tiebreaker.</LD>
<TE>   The sisters combined for 101 unforced errors and 13 service
breaks. Venus, seeded second, double-faulted nine times and had one
forehand winner and no backhand winners. In this case, statistics do
tell the story: The best server in the women's game, Venus, held
serve twice in the first set and only once in the second.</TE>
<TE>   They've played compelling matches against other players, and lousy
ones. Against each other, they don't seem to flow or strike an even
rhythm. They are like two award-winning actors who simply can't
function decently on the same stage, stepping all over each other's
lines and missing cues.</TE>
<TE>   Give Serena the necessary credit. She has become her own person,
not just Venus' younger sister, and crowded her older sister off the
stage, right off the court with her powerful strokes.</TE>
<TE>   For Serena, seeded third here, it was her first Grand Slam title
since winning the 1999 U.S. Open at 17.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm very, very happy, especially to win another Grand
Slam because I was really fighting so long," she said. "At one point,
I wouldn't get past the quarters, then I got to the final, maybe a
semi. But it was kind of discouraging. I didn't want to be a one-hit
wonder."</TE>
<TE>   She desperately wanted to add another Slam to her resume. After
all, Venus had the big Grand Slam lead in the family: four to one.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs today were getting tired," Serena said. "I had to keep
thinking, 'OK, Serena, five and one? Or four and two? Which do you
want?' That got me motivated just to keep running and to keep
fighting."</TE>
<TE>   The reaction of Venus on Saturday in Paris--compared to that of
1999 at the U.S. Open--spoke volumes about her maturity.</TE>
<TE>   When Serena won in New York, the first Grand Slam title for either
sister, Venus sat in the stands, glumly, barely visible under a hood,
and clapped faintly. Since then, Venus, 21, has won four Slam titles,
most recently at the U.S. Open in September against Serena in the
final.</TE>
<TE>   During the awards ceremony when Serena was receiving the Suzanne
Lenglen Cup from Olympic skiing legend Jean-Claude Killy of France,
Venus went to a back corner of the court, got a camera from her
mother and joined the pack of news photographers taking pictures of
Serena.</TE>
<TE>   Serena, spotting Venus in the scrum, laughed and shook her head.
"It was very funny when she was doing that," Serena said. "Hey, none
of us have won the French Open yet, so we had to get that first
moment."</TE>
<TE>   The point that earned Serena the title was one of the better ones.
At the end of a long baseline rally, Serena hit a hard cross-court
backhand and Venus hit a backhand in the net. Serena tossed her
racket in joy and leaned over for a moment. Their mother and coach,
Oracene, threw back her head and laughed at the joyful reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the players' lounge, she provided some insight into
Serena's learning curve since her U.S. Open victory in 1999. After
that win, tennis seemed to take a reduced role in Serena's life, but
her outlook changed last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "She stopped playing and started practicing," Oracene said. "She
left some of those extracurricular activities. She was really having
a good time. But she stopped that and she started practicing more. I
don't think it [Venus' success] bothered her as much because she was
doing her own thing for a while, for a few months. She was just
having fun, being who she was. I thought it would play its course
out."</TE>
<TE>   Oracene knew something was different on the plane ride to Europe.
Serena told her that she planned on staying in Paris for two weeks,
meaning she would win the French Open, or at least reach the final.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first time a younger sister has defeated an older
sister in a Grand Slam event. Venus and Serena have played eight
times; Venus leads, 5-3, and 3-1 in Grand Slams. But they are 1-1 in
Grand Slam finals, and, quite conceivably, they could meet in another
final in another country in about four weeks, at Wimbledon. Williams
vs. Williams could be on the horizon for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   That immediate possibility is even stronger because they will be
in opposite halves of the draw at the All England Club. Venus and
Serena will be No. 1 and No. 2 when the WTA rankings are released
Monday, both passing Jennifer Capriati. It is the first time siblings
have held the top two spots in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   This fulfills the long-ago prediction of their father. He knew it
would happen, and so did they, even if few embraced their vision in
the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still very confident in myself," Venus said. "I would say,
'Yes, of course, I can be No. 1 and I think I'll be the best.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think people looked at that as conceited or big-headed. I think
it's OK to believe in yourself."</TE>
<TE>   For Venus and Serena, the answer was simply winning. And, though
it is long overdue, the sisters are finally being recognized as
individuals, not just as the Williams Sisters. Certainly, Serena's
success will help accelerate the process.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think so," Serena said. "Especially with us both
doing so well. In the past I wasn't doing so well, but with us doing
well now, people are beginning to see us as separate people and with
separate games. We're different people. We have different hearts. We
have a different set of legs. We're definitely different."</TE>

<HD>With Ruiz Suspended, Galaxy Defense Leads 1-0 Win</HD>

<LD>No Carlos Ruiz? No matter.</LD>
<LD>   With Major League Soccer's leading scorer serving a
league-mandated one-game suspension Saturday, the Galaxy turned to
its defense against the Chicago Fire in hopes of breaking a
three-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   It was only fitting, then, that a Galaxy defender scored the
winning goal.</LD>
<TE>   Alexi Lalas' header off Simon Elliott's corner kick in the 57th
minute proved to be the difference in the Galaxy's 1-0 victory in
front of 13,223 at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We do corner kicks every day [in practice] and we certainly try
to find [taller] guys on our team like myself," said the 6-foot-3
Lalas, whose first goal of the season was only the fifth of the
Galaxy's 15 this year not scored by Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   "Earlier in the year I was getting my head on them; they just
weren't going in. And it's a matter of continuing your runs and it's
obviously the way the ball is played in, which is the most important
thing. Simon hit a great ball and we went from there."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy (5-4-2), which had played six of its previous seven MLS
matches on the road and had not played at home since April 27,
continued its success against the Fire (5-4-2).</TE>
<TE>   Dating to last season's playoffs, the Galaxy has beaten Chicago in
five consecutive matches, including three this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we can play them every week and our record would be
better," joked Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid. "It's always a tough game
and we just have good luck against them."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy had a familiar face in the net against Chicago. Kevin
Hartman recorded his first shutout of the year in his second start.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, who had surgery to repair a broken right wrist in
November, lost the starting position to Matt Reis in preseason
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily things went my way today," Hartman said. "There weren't a
lot of shots but ... there are a lot of other things that you do as a
goalkeeper besides save shots.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of organization, and I thought the guys were
unbelievable today tactically. They were really disciplined and
everybody stepped up today and performed."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy limited the Fire to seven shots, one on goal, a
blistering shot by forward Mike Nugent in the game's 79th minute that
a diving Hartman was able to deflect.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman said he was never in danger of being lulled despite the
lack of action. "Not really, but come halftime and you haven't
received a shot yet, there's always that [feeling that] you want to
receive some more shots since you haven't seen a ball come at you,"
he said. "You're trying to keep yourself in the game by talking to
your defense and filling in holes and ... it's always a difficult
thing to do when you're not receiving shots and then to have a shot
like the one in the last few minutes of the game."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the Galaxy played the final 21 minutes a man
down after Peter Vagenas was issued a second yellow card for holding
Ante Razov.</TE>
<TE>   Razov, who began the game as the league's second-leading scorer
with 19 points (eight goals, three assists), also received a yellow
card by referee Kevin Terry after Razov hit Vagenas with an open left
hand to the face.</TE>
<TE>   Said Schmid, who wondered why Razov wasn't ejected: "Maybe body
punches are more vicious than facial hits."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who has 20 points on 10 goals, was suspended after striking
Colorado Rapid midfielder Wes Hart in the midsection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   D.C. United 3, New England 2--Defender Ryan Nelson's second goal
of the game broke a second-half tie and gave D.C. United (4-5-1) a
victory before 12,988 at Washington. Taylor Twellman scored twice for
New England (3-6-1).</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Colorado 1--Bobby Rhine, held scoreless in the first 10
games of the season, had three goals and an assist as the Burn
(4-2-5) beat the Rapids (6-4-1) before 12,690 at Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Makes a Huge Impression</HD>
<DH>Interleague: He hits one of the longest homers in Yankee
Stadium history and the Giants beat Rivera, 4-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds won't forget his first Yankee Stadium home run or the way
his San Francisco Giant teammates found a way to beat Mariano Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit one of the most impressive homers ever at baseball's
most famous ballpark and the Giants took advantage of Alfonso
Soriano's error to beat baseball's best closer, 4-3, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt good hitting a home run in the House That Ruth Built,"
Bonds said. "Anybody would feel good about that. It feels a lot
better because we won."</LD>
<TE>   After Bonds hit a three-run homer almost halfway up the upper deck
in right field in the first inning, San Francisco didn't score again
until the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, Rich Aurilia walked on a 3-2 pitch with
one out against Rivera (1-3). That set up a highly anticipated
confrontation between Rivera and Bonds. With the sellout crowd of
55,194 cheering every pitch, Rivera struck out Bonds on a high
fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "He's nasty," Bonds said. "That's why he's the best."</TE>
<TE>   The fans seemed to sense that the danger was over, but the Giants
weren't finished.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent fouled off four two-strike pitches before hitting a soft
single that sent Aurilia to third base, and Benito Santiago followed
with a broken-bat grounder to second.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go for the ball with my glove, but it went to the
right so I had to try to grab it with my hand," Soriano said.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano was unable to barehand the ball as it took a tricky hop.
It hit off his hand and Aurilia scored the go-ahead run on the play.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really no reason to barehand the ball when you can help
yourself with the glove," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees committed three errors and managed a season-low two
hits in 7 1/3 innings against Giant starter Jason Schmidt, who had 13
strikeouts.</TE>

<HD>Daniel Nearing a Major Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The LPGA Championship has produced career Grand Slams twice in the
last three years, so DuPont Country Club in Wilmington, Del., is no
stranger to history.</LD>
<LD>   With Beth Daniel in control, this could be one for the ages.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel, a 45-year-old whose last victory was seven years ago,
seized control Saturday with a three-under-par 68 that expanded her
lead to four strokes and moved her one round closer to becoming the
oldest woman to win a major.</LD>
<TE>   Babe Zaharias was 42 years 11 months when she won the 1954 U.S.
Women's Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a great story," Daniel said.</TE>
<TE>   She gave herself the chance with a great round--six birdies on a
course where the premium is par, the last birdie a 25-foot putt on
the 18th hole that found the center of the cup and left Daniel
smiling like a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm making a lot of birdies, and that makes up for a lot of
mistakes," said Daniel, who was at eight-under 205.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, who won the LPGA Championship for her first career
victory in 1998, did well to keep within four strokes. The
24-year-old Korean had only one bogey in a round of 68, sticking to
her plan of hitting fairways and greens.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't push anything," Pak said. "I had a great score."</TE>
<TE>   Not much went right for Karrie Webb, who won the LPGA Championship
last year to complete the career Grand Slam. She fought her swing
most of the day and couldn't get enough putts to fall.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of game is a recipe for disaster at DuPont this week,
although Webb managed to scrape out a 72 and was at 211 along with
Kim Saiki (69). They were the only players who remained under par.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Smith needed 30 holes to take the third-round lead in the
Buick Classic at Westchester Country Club in Harrison, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Up at 4:30 a.m. for the completion of the second round, the
long-hitting Smith had a two-putt birdie on the par-five 18th to
break a tie with Loren Roberts and David Gossett.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long day," said Smith, who finished off a three-under
69 in the morning and added a 67. "I don't get tired physically, but
I could feel myself getting mentally tired the last three or four
holes." "</TE>
<TE>   The five-time Buy.com Tour winner was at 11-under 202 on the West
Course at Westchester. Gossett and Roberts, neighbors in Germantown,
Tenn., were a stroke back, and Pat Perez and Canadian Ian Leggatt
followed at nine-under.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-year-old Gossett, with sister Joni caddying, shot a 70, and
Roberts, three weeks short of his 47th birthday, had a 71.</TE>

<HD>McPeek Turns Recent Layoff Into Big Payoff</HD>

<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The plane landed at the small airport in Farmingdale, N.Y., early
Wednesday morning carrying four horses who had been stabled at
Churchill Downs in Kentucky. Three of them, including Kentucky Derby
and Preakness winner War Emblem, were here for Saturday's Belmont
Stakes. The fourth had bummed a ride.</LD>
<LD>   Most people were shocked to see Harlan's Holiday emerge from the
van an hour or so later at Belmont Park. After entering the Derby as
the favorite, he had finished a badly beaten seventh and had not
redeemed himself with a fourth-place finish in the Preakness. His
connections had decided that his Triple Crown campaign should end
there, so there seemed to be no reason for him to be here.</LD>
<LD>   Explaining later, owner Jack Wolf said that he had decided to
change trainers, moving the horse from Ken McPeek at Churchill Downs
to Todd Pletcher at Belmont. Trying to soften the blow, Wolf said
that he has moved to Saratoga, N.Y., and wanted the horse closer to
his home.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't the worst day of McPeek's life. That day was two years
ago, when his wife, Sue, learned after a visit to the dentist that
she had a cancer growing inside her mouth. She was pregnant at the
time, and, before chemotherapy treatments could begin, doctors had to
induce labor. Both mother and daughter are fine now.</TE>
<TE>   So McPeek never will be quite as distraught by anything that
happens on the job now as he might have been before. But he still
felt like he had been kicked by a horse, instead of merely being
fired from one.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little confused about why he left," McPeek said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He still had a horse in the Belmont, although it didn't appear to
most people as if it was much of a  race horse. Sarava, who won a
race on the Preakness undercard three weeks ago at Pimlico but had
never been tested against really good horses, started at 30-1 and, by
post time Saturday, was at 70-1. In 133 previous Belmont Stakes, no
horse had ever overcome such odds to win. So, of course, that's what
Sarava did, win. A $2 bet paid $142.50.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe if something bad happens to you, something good is
bound to happen to you later in your life," McPeek said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the life of me, I'll never figure out horse racing.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that makes me smarter than most of the record crowd
of 103,222 on Saturday at Belmont Park is that I didn't bet.</TE>
<TE>   If I had, there's no chance I would have bet on Sarava.</TE>
<TE>   All the answers in horse racing are usually found in the Daily
Racing Form. The problem is that the charts make a lot more sense
after a race than before. But if you look at Sarava's chart, even
now, there is no solid reason to bet him unless you see something in
the name of his owners, New Phoenix Stable.</TE>
<TE>   People a lot smarter than I am will tell you that.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Daily News handicapper Saturday dismissed Sarava as
an "honest, grinding sort."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Beyer, the Washington Post guy who knows as much as anybody
about the sport, said Sarava was "terribly overmatched."</TE>
<TE>   McPeek rattled off some fractions from the horse's victory in the
Sir Barton Stakes at Pimlico and said "some of the handicappers have
to do a little math."</TE>
<TE>   But, asked if he thought at the start of the Triple Crown races
that Sarava was a Belmont horse, McPeek admitted, "Absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe he was right initially, when he talked about bad times
turning into good times, and that horse racing is really all about
karma.</TE>
<TE>   That's as good a way to bet as any.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's just that the sun doesn't shine on the same horse's
rump every day.</TE>
<TE>   After finally convincing virtually everyone in the Preakness that
his Kentucky Derby win was no fluke, War Emblem, trying to become
only the 12th horse to sweep the Triple Crown races, stumbled out of
the gate. Instead of running out front as he prefers, he learned how
the other half lives, getting sand kicked in his face while looking
for some breathing room along the rail, and finished an exhausted
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse, from the start, we were doomed," his trainer, Bob
Baffert, said.</TE>
<TE>   He said if he'd had a walkie-talkie to communicate with jockey
Victor Espinoza, he would have told him to give it up before they hit
the quarter pole. Why take a chance of the horse getting hurt?</TE>
<TE>   A lot of horse people, most of them probably jealous of Baffert's
eight wins in Triple Crown races, will tell you that this proves once
again that he isn't the trainer his record indicates he is. Or that
he thinks he is. This was the third time in six years he'd entered
the Belmont with a chance to win the Triple Crown and the third time
he came up short, this time way short.</TE>
<TE>   I would counter that a trainer doesn't get in the position to win
one Triple Crown, much less three, if he doesn't know what he's
doing.</TE>
<TE>   When Wayne Lukas said before the Preakness that Baffert "has been
on scholarship his whole life," Baffert said, "They don't give
scholarships to dummies."</TE>
<TE>   Like when he finished second with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real
Quiet in '98, Baffert didn't act as if somebody had died when he lost
this one.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time I win the Derby, I'm heading home," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   He said the most disappointed he has ever been after a race was
when he finished second by a nose with Cavonnier in his first
Kentucky Derby, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "But I thought I'd never get back there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back here [with a Triple Crown chance]. We'll get it
done, hopefully."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, he congratulated the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "Good for Kenny," Baffert said. "He'll show those guys he knows
how to train a horse."</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Megahertz improves to 4-0 in U.S. with
comeback victory in Honeymoon Breeders' Cup Handicap for fillies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unbeaten in her first three starts in the United States, Megahertz
ran like she never had before in the $164,050 Honeymoon Breeders' Cup
Handicap on Saturday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-10 favorite in the Grade II, she appeared to have no chance
with about a sixteenth of a mile to go. She lacked room and Arabic
Song, the 3-1 second choice, had gotten the jump on her.</LD>
<LD>   But jockey Patrick Valenzuela finally was able to find some room
between horses, and Megahertz, a 3-year-old, English-bred filly, did
the rest.</LD>
<TE>   With an exceptional burst of speed, she got up and prevailed by
three-quarters of a length. The final time for the 1 1/8 miles on
turf was not impressive (1:51 4/5), but that was because of the
extremely slow early pace. The first six furlongs were run in 1:16
4/5, so the final three-eighths were accomplished in a rapid 35 flat.
The winner ran her final eighth of a mile in 11 1/5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Michael Bello and trained by Bobby Frankel, who won the
Honeymoon for the first time, Megahertz won only once in eight starts
in France, but she is clearly one of the best 3-year-old grass
fillies in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "She has some kind of turn of foot," said Valenzuela, Hollywood
Park's leading rider. "I've been on some horses that ... well, the
last one I can remember with a turn of foot that quick was [1991
Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner] Arazi.</TE>
<TE>   "She's so nice. I really like this filly. I was following [Arabic
Song] all the way around. When she got through, I just angled to the
outside, and boom, she just ran by that filly like nothing. This is a
very special filly."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first stakes winner ridden by Valenzuela for Frankel
since Al Mamoon in the 1987 John Henry. It was also the 110th stakes
win for the Hall of Fame trainer at Hollywood Park, tying him with
Ron McAnally for second on the all-time list. The late Charlie
Whittingham leads with 222.</TE>
<TE>   Like the winner, Arabic Song had been perfect in this country
after coming over from France. Seeking her third consecutive victory,
she finished a half-length in front of 3-1 second choice High
Society. Then came Alozaina, pacesetter Red Little Lies, Doc's Lil'
Angel and La Martina, who had finished only a nose behind Megahertz
in their last meeting in the Providencia on April 13 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Hotel Hall won the second race, it gave jockey Laffit Pincay
Jr. his 3,000th career victory at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay, the world's winningest rider with 9,372 victories, added
two more before the long day was over.</TE>
<TE>   He won the fifth with 10-1 shot Munjiz and survived a stewards'
inquiry to take the ninth with 4-1 shot Macaneo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for her first stakes win, Fun House is the 5-2 favorite
against seven other 3-year-old fillies in the $75,000 Manhattan Beach
today at Hollywood Park. The ungraded race is at 5 1/2 furlongs on
the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Verne Winchell's VHW Stables and trained by
McAnally, the daughter of Prized will be returning to the grass after
finishing a distant third behind September Secret in the Railbird
Stakes on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   She is also being reunited with jockey Chris McCarron, who has
been aboard for both of her victories.</TE>
<TE>   Carinae, who finished behind Fun House twice at Santa Anita, is
the 7-2 second choice. Trained by Frankel for Flaxman Holdings, the
daughter of Nureyev has one win in four starts in this country.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, the rest of the field for the Manhattan Beach
includes Partytime, Ristra, Ponche De Leona, Oriana's Magic, Ragin T
Rex and Chupa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro ($7.40) made it two wins in a row since being gelded with
a victory in the $150,000 All American Handicap at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss and trained by John Sadler, the
4-year-old son of Pleasant Tap was ridden by Jason Lumpkins. He
completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 1/5. It was his fourth win in 17
starts. Moonlight Meeting was second and Prodigious was third in the
field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Sadler also won the eighth at Bay Meadows with Honesty Pays.</TE>

<LD>Although it wasn't the Triple Crown winner a lot of people were
hoping for, Belmont Park did produce something extremely noteworthy
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Sarava's stunning upset in the Belmont Stakes and a
couple of other surprises, there is a pick six carryover for today of
$685,751 at the Elmont, N.Y., track.</LD>
<LD>   The best horse running anywhere in the country today is also the
most logical single in the pick six, which covers races 3-8.</LD>
<TE>   Xtra Heat, the 4-year-old sprint machine, will go for her 21st win
in 27 starts in the $150,000 Vagrancy Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Ken Taylor and John and Harry Deitchman, and trained by
John Salzman, the Dixieland Heat filly will carry the top weight of
127 pounds, spotting her five foes anywhere from nine to 14 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Xtra Heat, who has won three of five at Belmont Park,
has already won carrying 128 pounds. Worse than third only once in
her career, she will again be ridden by Harry Vega in the 6
1/2-furlong Vagrancy.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup in the Grade II Stakes race includes some other ladies
who have had success at Belmont. Cat Cay, a late-running daughter of
Pleasant Colony, has won three of six in Elmont and Shine Again, who
was second to Xtra Heat in last month's Genuine Risk, has never been
worse than third in seven races at the track.</TE>
<TE>   La Galerie, Gold Mover and Celtic Melody, who complete the field,
are all one-time winners at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park brings out some
2-year-old firsters sired by former Hollywood Gold Cup winners
Gentlemen and Siphon along with rookies by Pulpit and Clever Trick.
The seventh marks the return of Tamara Princess, a winner of three of
four and a full sister to former champion mare Riboletta.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Surprise Halo. The 4-year-old Glomar gelding will seek
his sixth consecutive win on turf in today's ninth at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Magical. Good enough to win the Will Rogers at
Hollywood Park in 1998, the 7-year-old finished last against $8,000
claimers on Friday night. Wouldn't it be nice if he was retired? It's
clear he can't run anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Dance Dreamer in the sixth
with Sligo Bay, Blue Steller, Rafid and McDab in the two hole and all
in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 6/93. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $29.80/$534.60. Total money bet: $602.</TE>

<HD>Rookie Harang Does His Job for Athletics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a rookie who started the season in double A, Aaron Harang is
remarkably composed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a relaxed guy, you know," he said. "I don't show my emotions
a whole lot."</LD>
<LD>   Harang refused to get rattled for his third start Saturday, even
when facing Jeff Bagwell with the bases loaded, and got the win as
the Oakland Athletics beat the Houston Astros, 5-1, at Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   Harang (2-1) gave up six hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings, lowering
his earned-run average to 0.93. He walked four and struck out two.</TE>
<TE>   Called up from triple-A Sacramento on May 25, Harang has given up
only three runs--two earned--in his first three starts. He struck out
Bagwell swinging with the bases loaded to end the third with the game
scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada homered as the resurgent A's have won seven of nine
games, improving their record to 31-30. They had not been above .500
since May 8, when they were 17-16.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Colorado 1--The Blue Jays have won eight of nine games
and improved to 5-1 under Manager Carlos Tosca. Vernon Wells and
Carlos Delgado homered in the seventh inning at SkyDome and Pete
Walker (2-0) and relievers Cliff Politte and Kelvim Escobar combined
on a four-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Florida 3--Jacque Jones and Torii Hunter each drove
in two runs at Minneapolis to lead the Twins, who are a major
league-best 23-10 at home. The Marlins began the weekend with the
best interleague record, 51-33, over the last five years but lost the
first two.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Texas 3--Andruw Jones hit his second home run of the
game in the 10th inning at Arlington, Texas, a three-run shot off
Hideki Irabu. It was the seventh homer Irabu (2-6) has given up in
four outings. He is 1-4 in his last five appearances and has
converted only one save during that span.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, San Diego 2--Steve Cox singled home Randy Winn with
the winning run in the 10th inning at St. Petersburg, Fla. Ron Gant
homered off starter Tanyon Sturtze in the top of the ninth inning to
send the game into extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Chicago White Sox 1--Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead
homer leading off the top of the ninth inning, handing the White Sox
their 11th loss in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 11, Kansas City 3--Albert Pujols, Miguel Cairo and Eli
Marrero each hit three-run homers at Kansas City, Mo., as the
Cardinals improved to 8-9 against the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Detroit 1--Travis Lee's run-scoring single in the
eighth inning gave the Phillies the victory at Detroit. Danny
Patterson (0-2) gave up a one-out triple to Bobby Abreu. Pat Burrell
tied the score with a bloop single over a drawn-in infield. After
Jeremy Giambi walked, Lee drove him in with two out.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Touring Series driver John Baker was
killed Saturday night during a race at Irwindale Speedway. Baker was
the first person to be killed in a Featherlite Southwest race since
the series' inception in 1986, and the fourth at the track in its
four-year history. He was 44.</LD>
<LD>   Baker, from Tucson, was in the middle of competing in the K &amp; N
Filters 150 as he entered the first turn on lap 36.</LD>
<LD>   As Baker entered turn two, he was being passed by Greg Voigt on
the inside lane.</LD>
<TE>   Baker checked his speed and slowed, but lost control of his
Chevrolet Monte Carlo as he exited turn two.</TE>
<TE>   He bumped into Voigt's right side and headed into the wall along
the backstretch, just past the entry chute from the pit area.</TE>
<TE>   The 6,160 fans in attendance watched as Baker slammed headfirst
into the wall, bouncing off at an angle toward the infield. But
before the car stopped, it was clipped by Sean Woodside's car in the
back and the car came to rest on the edge of the one-third-mile inner
track.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the efforts of the rescue crew, Baker was unresponsive
after being pulled from the damaged car.</TE>
<TE>   He was transported to Kaiser Permanente Baldwin Park Medical
Center, but according to Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic
John Denton, Baker was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   There was no comment available from officials of the track or the
Featherlite Southwest Series.</TE>
<TE>   In the first fatal accident at the track, Casey Deimert, 23, was
killed while practicing in a sprint car on opening night, March 27,
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Cowherd, 49, a speed truck driver from Phoenix, died six
months later, on Sept. 25, 1999, of injuries suffered in a
two-vehicle accident at Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Shields, 30, died June 7, 2001, six days after crashing
while racing a test car at the track.</TE>

<HD>Italy Latest Upset Victim</HD>
<DH>Group G: Croatia's 2-1 victory is marred by two
questionable calls. Italy's Vieri blames loss on 'village referees.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SENDAI, Japan</DL>
<LD>A funny thing happened to France, Portugal, Argentina and Italy on
the way to the World Cup semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   All of them, consensus favorites to contend for the title, have
already been defeated--and the first round has six days to go.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Argentina lost to England, Italy fell victim to the
upset wave sweeping across Japan and South Korea, losing to Croatia
in controversial fashion, 2-1, Saturday at Ibaraki.</LD>
<TE>   The Italians had two goals disallowed--a header by Christian Vieri
that was ruled offside and a slow roller by Filippo Inzaghi that was
nullified by a linesman's claim that Inzaghi had freed himself by
pulling on a defender's shirt.</TE>
<TE>   That left the Italians in a dour mood, with Vieri grousing that
the officials "weren't division one or even division two referees.
They were village referees."</TE>
<TE>   But the fact remains that Italy surrendered two goals and was
generally outplayed by a Croatia outfit that looked better suited for
a Zagreb over-30 rec league during its 1-0 loss to Mexico on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic's response to the Mexican debacle was to
bench two of the team's aging cornerstones, Davor Suker and Robert
Prosinecki. By opting for younger legs over bigger names, Jozic
injected new life into the Croatian attack--and Italy seemed
unprepared for it.</TE>
<TE>   Vieri gave Italy a temporary lead by heading in a cross from
Cristiano Doni in the 55th minute. The goal was Vieri's third of the
tournament and his eighth in seven World Cup appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Croatia countered with two goals in four minutes--Ivica Olic from
short range in the 73rd minute, Milan Rapaic banging a volley off
Italy defender Marco Materazzi into the net in the 76th.</TE>
<TE>   But Italy appeared unfairly denied a draw when Vieri's 50th-minute
header was disallowed. Replays showed Vieri onside as he began his
run for Materazzi's long arching feed.</TE>
<TE>   Inzaghi's nullified goal was more questionable. The Italian
forward did have a handful of a Croatian defender's jersey as he made
his break for the ball and the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not understand why our equalizer was disallowed," Italy
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an intense game.... These things happen, and the important
thing is not to get demoralized. I don't want to get into [the]
judging. But I thought that one of the goals--or even both
goals--that were disallowed were OK. I think a draw would have been a
fair result."</TE>
<TE>   Croatia's victory left three teams tied atop Group G at three
points apiece. Mexico can break the deadlock with a victory or a tie
against Ecuador in a game that began Saturday at 11:30 p.m. Pacific
time.</TE>

<HD>Papis Goes at It Carefully</HD>

<LD>Max Papis isn't driving on Bridgestone tires as much as he is driving
on pins and needles. With only one Lola chassis at his disposal, and
unable to take the kind of risks that one might expect of "Mad Max,"
Papis has been one of the more amazing stories in the CART FedEx
Series.</LD>
<LD>   The defending champion at the 20th Grand Prix of Monterey
featuring the Shell 300, Papis is tied with Paul Tracy for third
place in the standings among Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers.
Through four of 20 races, he is 10 points behind first-place Michel
Jordain Jr., despite being more than four months removed from his
only day of testing this season--a half-day, at that--and driving a
2001 chassis affectionately called Old Faithful.</LD>
<LD>   Papis will start 17th among 19 drivers on the grid today at Mazda
Raceway Laguna Seca. (He won last year starting 25th among 26.)
Toyota-powered Lolas took the top three qualifying spots, with
Brazilian drivers taking three of the top four. Cristiano Da Matta
averaged 115.970 mph to win his first career pole position, and next
to him is Sweden's Kenny Brack, the top qualifier Friday and second
best Saturday. Bruno Junquiera was third, and Tony Kanaan fourth in a
Honda-Lola. Da Matta was fined $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct
for failing to get his car off the racing line after his engine let
loose late in the session, hindering other lap times.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Wieringa, the Sigma Autosport team owner who fielded a car
driven by Oriol Servia last season, is happy with Papis, the only
driver in the field with a blank sidepod.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more people are calling us the little engine that
could," Wieringa said. "We had a mechanical failure in Motegi [Japan]
or we could be leading the championship."</TE>
<TE>   There might be help on the horizon. Sunoco, the petroleum company,
announced Saturday it will be an associate sponsor the rest of the
season, and Wieringa said he might soon have an announcement
involving two Fortune 500 companies.</TE>

<HD>No Trouble of Any Kind for O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two games of the NBA Finals, one of the more telling
developments is that Shaquille O'Neal has stayed in them.</LD>
<LD>   He played much of the Western Conference finals in foul trouble or
on the brink of it, because the Sacramento King centers had a
defensive reputation and because O'Neal was vulnerable to offensive
fouls and penetrating guards.</LD>
<LD>   He hasn't had the same issues against the New Jersey Nets, though
Laker Coach Phil Jackson often marvels at how differently O'Neal is
officiated on the road than at Staples Center, and the next two
games--at least--will be played at Continental Airlines Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been pacing myself defensively, just picking what shots to
go after," O'Neal said. "Just not worrying about it. I think when I
worry about it, that's when I get into foul trouble. Just going and
playing my game. Each set of officials is going to call a game
different, but I'm not going to waste my time figuring out who's
calling the game and how they call it, doing all this stuff. It just
takes up too much time. I just want to go out and play and whatever
happens, happens."</TE>
<TE>   In 81 minutes of the Finals, O'Neal has been called for four
fouls. The Shaq Pack--Todd MacCulloch, Aaron Williams and Jason
Collins--has accumulated 22 fouls in 99 minutes. O'Neal's advantage,
of course, is that he doesn't have to defend himself, and none of the
Net centers is offensively aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   It is a rout in the middle. En route to a 2-0 series lead, O'Neal
has 76 points, 28 rebounds and nine assists. His Net counterparts
have 31 points, 23 rebounds and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No one is better at finding O'Neal in the post than Brian Shaw,
and to that end he played 22 minutes in Game 2, after playing 11 in
Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   From the conference finals, Lindsey Hunter has lost time. Derek
Fisher, after playing 36 minutes in Game 1, played 29 in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a long, miserable trip through the first three rounds,
Fisher again has made an end-to-end impact for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   He is eight for 16 from the field, including three for five from
the arc, and is averaging 12.5 points. Also, he's one of the reasons
Jason Kidd has been unable to push the Nets into their fastbreak
offense or find his scoring touch. Kidd is 17 for 43 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   A terrible three-point shooting team for much of the postseason
(35.6% against Portland, 33.8% against San Antonio and 27.6% against
Sacramento) and again in Game 1 of the Finals (1 for 10), the Lakers
made nine of 16 three-point shots in Game 2. Kobe Bryant, shooting
32.7% from the arc in 16 previous playoff games, made three of three,
two well after the outcome was decided.</TE>
<TE>   "Felt like I had my radar on," Bryant said. "Felt good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox was among those whose wave to the Staples Center crowd
Friday night had a farewell look to it, though Fox said afterward he
hadn't intended that impression.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not over," he said. "That team, at every turn, seems to
find its way back in the game."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Move Center's Stage to New Jersey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd sat in the interview room at Staples Center on Friday
night and said, "We're not intimidated by Shaq," and, of course, no
one believed him.</LD>
<LD>   An hour before, Shaquille O'Neal had worn Aaron Williams as a
shawl, over his shoulders like evening wear, after pump-faking him
into the air.</LD>
<LD>   Now, if you're the New Jersey Nets and you've just thrown your
strongest player at the Lakers, and O'Neal brings him back as though
he were carrying a downed buck out of the forest, maybe it's time to
consider your mortality in these NBA Finals.</LD>
<TE>   Through two games, there is only one hunter in this series.
Everyone else is hiding in a log. The Lakers, on the strength of
O'Neal's immovable game, lead the series, two games to none, with
Game 3 tonight at Continental Airlines Arena, and so they are that
close to their precious three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   Games 4 and, ahem, 5 also are scheduled for the same building,
though the Lakers are at a point now where a series of more than four
games would appear untidy. O'Neal scored 36 points in Game 1, then 40
in Game 2, and everything Net Coach Byron Scott has tried, it seems,
has been brought back over O'Neal's shoulders and laid at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like he never has a bad night," Net center Todd
MacCulloch said. "He just kind of wears you down."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have led the series for 59 seconds, a New Jersey minute,
2-0 and 4-2 in Game 1. They spent their three days in Los Angeles
falling behind by 20 points and then drawing within six, over and
over, never having quite enough, never getting around the ease in
which O'Neal has scored.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the way we want to play basketball," Scott said, as if
they had a choice in it. "We want to get it up and down the floor.
Right now, we're not being a very disciplined team, to be honest with
you."</TE>
<TE>   It happens every year around this time. Ask the Indiana Pacers.
Check with the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, who has played two solid games around O'Neal's
dominance, stood in the afterglow Friday night and said, "This is not
a fluke. It's a big stage. The world is watching."</TE>
<TE>   With his 34.2-point average in 17 career Finals games, O'Neal is
the leading scorer among those who have played at least 15 of them.
His 40-point Game 2 was his fifth 40-plus game in the Finals and the
43rd in Finals history, and he appears on his way to becoming a
Finals MVP for the third consecutive season, done previously only by
Michael Jordan, twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille, he's playing at a level now where, I mean, he's in his
prime, and there's nothing anybody can do about that," Kobe Bryant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the same health for O'Neal and the same tentative defense
by the Nets, the Lakers could finish this in East Rutherford, N.J.,
an easy drive from Newark, where O'Neal was born and spent his early
years. Since the league went to the 2-3-2 format in the mid-1980s, no
home team has won the middle three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won the middle three--what turned out to be the final
three--in Philadelphia last season. They have won 13 of their last 15
road playoff games, just a week ago becoming the first Laker team in
history to win a Game 7 on the road, in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "So, we know what history means for us," Coach Phil Jackson said
before Friday's game. "If we go and have a 2-0 lead into New Jersey,
it's going to be difficult for them to pull off a feat that's never
been done."</TE>
<TE>   And to do it in a place where O'Neal feels so comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do what I usually do when I go to New Jersey,"
O'Neal said. "I'm going to go see my father's father and I'm going to
see my great-grandmother. Chill out. Eat some macaroni and cheese and
fried chicken and just hang out. That will be about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have so much family there that I probably won't even see them.
They realize that, you know, they know not to call me. They know who
to call for tickets and stuff like that. But, I got to take care of
business. I mean, I'm sure they're New Jersey fans and I'm sure I'll
get booed and all that, but I'm on a mission and I want to take care
of business. Nothing else really matters."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "Right now, our focus is still to not be careless with
our respect for this team."</TE>
<TE>   No one figures the Nets to defend O'Neal straight up again. But,
then, Game 1 would have seemed evidence enough, and once again Net
guards and forwards hesitated on their double-team assignments in
Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect them to pick up the pressure defensively," Bryant said.
"They'll probably try to do that, so when we throw the ball in to
Shaquille, he'll catch it with 10 seconds left on the shot clock and
have less time to operate. I expect the shots that they missed here
in Staples Center to fall in New Jersey. I seriously doubt they'll
shoot 30-something percent in the first half there."</TE>
<TE>   If they are grasping for bits of confidence, the Nets will recall
that they beat the Lakers on their floor on April 3, by 94-92, when
Bryant led the Lakers back from a 19-point deficit, only to miss a
point-blank put-back near the final buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   However, O'Neal didn't play in that game.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing with the Lakers is they probably feel they haven't
played their best game yet, and they've been successful," Kidd said.
"So, in that aspect, that could be scary.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been down this road, more than once."</TE>

<LD>Believe it or not, somebody will win the first race today.</LD>
<LD>   One of three thoroughbred races on the card, the 4 1/2-furlong
race for $2,500 maidens attracted nine fillies and mares ranging in
age from 3-7.</LD>
<LD>   Between them, the one Arizona bred and eight California breds have
combined for zero victories in 83 starts.</LD>
<TE>   Only five of the nine have managed to finish second or third and
the leader in that category is Two Unpredictable. A 7-year-old, she
has been second three times and third on nine other occasions. This
will be her 48th start.</TE>
<TE>   Gummy Delight, a 5-year-old daughter of Ventriloquist, may be the
one to beat. A seven-time loser, she will be making her first start
at this level after failing for $32,000 and $25,000 at Santa Anita
and five times at the $5,000 plateau at Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Rosario Alcala and trained by Jack Bentley Jr., Gummy
Delight will be ridden by Joel Cruz and break from the two hole. The
drawback with her is a lack of early speed, but the class drop may
make all the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Gummy Delight. 2. Jjackson Champus. 3. Shescape. 4.
Hubris. 5. Ageless. 6. Picante Paranoide. 7. Amender. 8. Valerio. 9.
Kims Cat.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Gummy Delight and Lovely Gay Shook in the first, single
Jjackson Champus in the second, use Shescape, Kelli Louise, Prompt
Settlement and Chill's Rose in the third and Hubris, Pals Eyes and
The Cash Broker in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Charodeey adds Lasix in the fifth in his second
start for trainer Connie Hall after having trouble in his bow on May
16. Silverio Time goes from an outside post to the rail in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>In Full Bloom</HD>
<DH>Suddenly a starter for the U.S., Mastroeni seizes the
opportunity with a cool demeanor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>As a gardener, Pablo Mastroeni knows what it's like to be uprooted
and transplanted. As a soccer player, he knows the same thing.</LD>
<LD>   As a gardener, Mastroeni knows the value of blooming at just the
right time.</LD>
<LD>   As a soccer player, the 25-year-old midfielder-defender has timed
things perfectly.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday, he started against Portugal in the World Cup and helped
the United States to a historic 3-2 upset victory. As recently as
January, even watching such a game in person would have been
unimaginable to him, let alone playing in it.</TE>
<TE>   Mastroeni was playing in Major League Soccer, as a central
defender for the Miami Fusion, when the league folded the team.</TE>
<TE>   It was the low point in a budding career for Mastroeni, who was
born in Mendoza, Argentina, of Italian heritage, was brought to the
U.S. at 4, and grew up in Phoenix, where he learned soccer under the
watchful eye of--coincidentally--a former Portuguese player.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the gardening.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather always had an amazing vegetable garden, and we'd
just go out and pick the vegetables and make our own salads,"
Mastroeni said. "He brought [a love of the soil] back from Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something I was always interested in, and I had so much
down time that I figured I should be doing something more with my
life."</TE>
<TE>   So Mastroeni has a garden. He also has a guitar, because besides
his love for soccer and gardening, he also loves music.</TE>
<TE>   "Just kind of folksy stuff," he said. "A little bluesy. Just my
own stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. national team has a precedent here, a red-haired,
red-goateed troubadour who made a name for himself before, during and
after the 1994 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that good," Mastroeni said, laughing, then added: "When I
grow up, I want to be like Alexi Lalas. I want to play in the World
Cup, I want to play in Italy, and I want to be in my own rock band."</TE>
<TE>   The first of those wishes came true Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It marked an incredible leap for a player who received his U.S.
citizenship only a year ago--"I never got around to it," he
explained--who made his national team debut against Ecuador on June
7, 2001, and who did not play in any of the U.S. team's 16 World Cup
qualifying matches.</TE>
<TE>   And yet here he is, guitar and all, playing in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ready to go," he said. "It was an intense game. We got some
good breaks early, and it made the game easier in the second half. I
think we surprised [the Portuguese]. They didn't take us as seriously
as they should have."</TE>
<TE>   The key to Mastroeni's meteoric rise was the 12-nation Gold Cup,
which the U.S. won at the Rose Bowl in February. Mastroeni played his
way onto the World Cup team, but his teammates on the Colorado
Rapids--the MLS side that uprooted him from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and transplanted him to Denver--are not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Pablo is a quality player," said Scottish striker John
Spencer. "I always found it very hard to play against him. He's a
good, tough competitor. Not dirty at all. Just 90 minutes of hard
work and always fair. He'll be playing for his country for many years
to come."</TE>
<TE>   It was Colorado Coach Tim Hankinson who converted Mastroeni from a
central defender to a defensive midfielder and thus helped him earn a
place on the World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Fraser, a former U.S. national team defender, said Mastroeni
took the change in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gotten better every game," he said. "He's more and more
confident with the ball at his feet, with people around him. He's
just brought a level of composure to our team that's been fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   There's a man responsible for Mastroeni's versatility. Luis Dabo
once played for Benfica, one of Portugal's most illustrious clubs.
Dabo taught Mastroeni the game at the Santos Soccer Club in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been my mentor all along," Mastroeni said. "Through college,
I'd go back and train with him. He's a great believer in having
technically sound players and then shipping them off somewhere where
tactics could be preached. He's just an amazing guy."</TE>
<TE>   Typical of Mastroeni's "cool" was his reaction to making the U.S.
World Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sense of calm," he said. "It wasn't so much of a
surprise as everyone believed it was. I thought I'd played myself
into a possibility. It was just a matter of the coach picking the
players that would best fit his team. It was more of a tranquil,
calming effect, knowing that there's another mountain to climb."</TE>
<TE>   The foothills were scaled against Portugal. South Korea lies ahead
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just 11 players, it's 60,000 fans in the stands,"
Mastroeni said. "But once you're on the pitch you really don't hear
anything, you're just focusing on the game. I think if we go out and
do what we need to do to win, I think we'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   Cool.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Ward overtook Al Unser Jr. just inches from the line Saturday
night to win the Boomtown 500 in another incredible finish at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.</LD>
<LD>   Ward never led until he beat Unser, who had the preferred inside
line, by a nose--only .0111 seconds--in the closest finish in Indy
Racing League history. That broke the record set at Texas last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Airton Dare finished third, .0595 seconds behind Ward, who won for
the first time in 51 career starts with an average speed of 169.984
mph.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know how we did it on the outside," said Ward, who is in
his first season with Chip Ganassi Racing. "This is a turnaround
point. We can look forward now."</TE>
<TE>   Helio Castroneves, who has won the last two Indianapolis 500s,
finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves passed fellow two-time Indy 500 winner Unser to take
the lead on lap 195, but Unser went high on the backstretch two laps
later and went back in front.</TE>
<TE>   Ward was running in the top four throughout the final laps, and
with a push from Dare on his tail, had just enough to win at the
line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jack Sprague finally got a NASCAR Busch Series victory to go with
his lead in the series points standings.</TE>
<TE>   Sprague, who gave up racing in the Craftsman Truck series after
winning his unprecedented third championship last year, passed Greg
Biffle to regain the lead with 23 laps to go and held on to win the
Inside Traxx 300 at Gladeville, Tenn. Sprague has raced some in the
Busch series since 1989 but had not won in 89 tries.</TE>

<TE>   Juan Pablo Montoya ended Michael Schumacher's string of poles at
the Canadian Grand Prix, leading a record-breaking assault on Circuit
Gilles Villeuve at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old Colombian driver sped through the 2.747-mile,
13-turn course in 1 minute 12.836 seconds and 133.934 mph, easily
breaking Schumacher's year-old record of 1:15.782, 130.494.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Talk about your desperate times....</LD>
<LD>   Their exciting playoff run just smashed into a wall and they're
running out of time to pick up the pieces. And, let's face it, who
says they'll ever be back in this position?</LD>
<LD>   Say good night, NBC.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, and the New Jersey Nets are in trouble too.</TE>
<TE>   Not that you couldn't see this coming six months ago, but it's
still rare that a mismatch lives down to its billing as these NBA
Finals have. The Lakers led by 23 in Game 1 before the Nets rallied
to make it look respectable at the end ... whereupon the Lakers waxed
them by 23 in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's ratings, up 14% entering the last Finals on its expiring
contract, promptly cratered and, unless the Nets pull off an upset
today, can still go south from here.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Nets are back in their turf in Truck-Stop Land, or
so we hear. The league has headquartered the media in midtown
Manhattan and is busing it back and forth through the jammed tunnels
to New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   This is a nice interlude for the media, since no one on the New
York side cares much about this series. The big sports stories here
this weekend were Barry Bonds playing in the House That Ruth Built
and War Emblem in the Belmont Stakes, not to mention the out-of-town
events like the Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson fight.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times and New York Post didn't even send a columnist
to Los Angeles. The Daily News planned a special section but killed
several stories when ad sales came up short.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you last year that people in New York don't care about
Philadelphia," said Bloomberg News' Manhattan-based Scott Soshnick.
"People in New York don't care about New Jersey, either."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are a few million front-runners in Gotham who
would have come over, if only the Nets could have done any
front-running. But that's how it is in your modern, West-tilting NBA
these days.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the 76ers put up a fight, winning Game 1, almost
winning Game 2 and sustaining interest through Game 4, when they
still had a chance to tie the series on their home court.</TE>
<TE>   However, the East, which was puny enough then, was even worse this
season, which doesn't seem like a hopeful trend for the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a plague-on-both-your-</TE>
<TE>   houses mood prevails in Gotham.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, noted the New York Times' Mike Wise, "can be hard to
root for too. Sure, Jason Kidd is awesome on the court. But his wife
is quoted more than Mike O'Koren, the assistant coach who has spent,
oh, his adult life living and breathing Nets basketball. They have a
great young coach in Byron Scott, who is objective and humble enough
to believe that Byron Scott should have been the coach of the year.
Their energetic young forward, Kenyon Martin, came from Bob Huggins'
mercenary program at Cincinnati (see Nick Van Exel, Ruben Patterson).
And any time anything goes wrong--from blown leads to bad airplane
food--everyone blames Keith Van Horn."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, the assistant coach thing. If a writer wishes to
interview one of them, he has to arrange it with the Nets' public
relations staff, which will want to know what he intends to ask.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are personable from President Rod Thorn on down but a
Kremlin atmosphere prevails, nonetheless, courtesy of Lou Lamoriello,
the NHL Devils maven who was put in charge of the entire operation by
(shudder) YankeeNets boss George Steinbrenner.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoriello, also known as "Tal-Lou-Ban," could have a little
softer image, himself.</TE>
<TE>   Facial hair is forbidden for employees, with a notable exception
made for Net players, because it obviously wouldn't be a good idea to
tell Kidd to shave his goatee this close to free agency.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent game, Lamoriello tangled with players' union head
Billy Hunter, who had lost his pass and wanted a replacement. Things
got so heated, the union rumbled about filing an National Labor
Relations Board complaint.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the local favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are the Lakers popular around here. The New York Times' Harvey
Araton recently wrote them off, noting:</TE>
<TE>   "Impressive as they are, the Lakers fit the superficiality of
their market and fuel the critics who scorn the NBA as star-struck to
the point of being scripted. Nothing against the unmatchable
[Shaquille] O'Neal, the Jordanesque [Kobe] Bryant and the Zen-coach
[Phil] Jackson, but, conceptually, the Lakers are prefab, the cast of
'Friends' hastily assembled as a ratings buffer while anticipating
the dissolution of 'Seinfeld.' For that reason, they are less
compelling, in my book, than the juggernauts of the NBA past."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, there may have been East teams such as, say, the
Knicks, which would have been more authentic representatives of their
presumably deeper markets, but, unfortunately, they all stunk.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem with the Lakers, who have appealing stars and are
easy to deal with--at least in the Finals--is finding a worthy rival
from the woebegone East.</TE>
<TE>   The last two Finals became one-sided and this one started out that
way. Without drama, the series are merely ceremonial and, outside
Lakerdom, b-o-r-i-n-g.</TE>
<TE>   Reseeding the final four, my solution, would address the problem,
not that I'm holding my breath.</TE>
<TE>   However, if this series ends quickly, not to mention mercifully
and the ratings tank ... and it happens again next season ...
anything could happen. In David Stern's NBA, all you need for
revolutionary change is low-enough ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this one is over yet. There's time for a last stand
before the lights go down and the party ends.</TE>
<TE>   For the Nets as well as NBC.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --The Nets, trailing the Lakers two games to
none, are in trouble for a number of reasons--not the least of which
is the fact that they are a jump-shooting team that suddenly can't
shoot.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets have made 67 of 180 shots (37.2%) in two games. Their
best shooters, the players whose perimeter play deflated the Boston
Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, have gone stone cold.</LD>
<LD>   Point guard Jason Kidd: 17 for 43.</LD>
<TE>   Shooting guard Kerry Kittles: 12 for 26.</TE>
<TE>   Small forward Keith Van Horn: eight for 23.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve guard Lucious Harris: one for 14.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Lakers have pressured the Nets nearer the basket,
having given up too much too often to the Sacramento Kings in the
West finals. But many of the Nets' jump shots are uncontested.</TE>
<TE>   The key, according to Van Horn, is the Lakers' willingness to take
away the Nets' medium-range game. The Lakers have been daring the
Nets to beat them from the outside. So far, the Lakers have won the
gamble.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've done a good job of plugging up the lane and
forcing us to take jumpers," Van Horn said. "We relied on our jump
shots too much, especially early on in the first half [of Games 1 and
2]. We need to be more aggressive going to the hoop and attacking
them and getting them in foul trouble."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here's all you need to know about the Nets' dependence on outside
shooting: Laker center Shaquille O'Neal had one foul in Game 1 and
two in Game 2. The Lakers had 20 fouls called against them Wednesday
and 21 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're going through a situation like that, you need to get
to the free-throw line," Van Horn said of the Nets' poor shooting.
"We need to get into the paint, get in a rhythm that way and be more
aggressive in terms of going to the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, free throws haven't been a cinch for New Jersey either.
The Nets are 32 of 53 at the line for a paltry 60.4%</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn discounted the notion that the Nets struggled to start
Game 2 because Kidd went scoreless in five shots. Kidd would make six
of 12 in the second half en route to 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because Jason wasn't playing on a high level doesn't mean we
should be down as much," Van Horn said, referring to the Nets'
10-point deficit with 3:55 remaining in the first quarter Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team game and collectively we needed to come out a little
better. You can't put it all on Jason."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets wanted the pace brisk in the Finals, and it has been, but
in the Lakers' favor. That's another troubling aspect of the Nets'
deficit, according to Coach Byron Scott, who pointed out the Lakers'
16-10 advantage in fastbreaks in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the way we want to play basketball," Scott said. "We
want to get it up and down the floor. Right now, we're not being a
very disciplined team, to be honest with you. We're not running the
break like we've been running it all season long.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something that concerns me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marion Jones, happy again and winning as usual, raced to victory in
the 100 meters at the U.S. Open track meet Saturday night at Stanford
into a head wind that "felt like I was running into a wall."</LD>
<LD>   Jones won in 11.20 seconds, a relatively poor time for the woman
who has dominated the sprints the last few years. But it was a decent
time when considering the wind was blowing straight into her face.</LD>
<LD>   "I kept getting stuff in my eyes in the warmup. I would have liked
to have good conditions and a good time," said Jones, who pulled away
from the field in the final 20 meters.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the dash was just the first sprint of the night for
Jones, who won an unprecedented five medals at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, she sped to San Francisco International Airport
for a flight to Munich, to be followed by a connecting flight to
Prague. She will run the 200 in a meet in Ostrava, Czech Republic, on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The women's 100 meters at the meet on Saturday was moved an hour
earlier so Jones could make her flight.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Dragila, who set two world records at this meet last year,
won the women's pole vault but cleared only 14 feet, 2 inches. Last
year at Stanford, she vaulted 15-9 1/4.</TE>
<TE>   She said the problem was in her technique, specifically her last
couple of steps on the runway, not the wind.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, I couldn't get it together," she said. "I guess
I have to get slapped around a little bit, and I did today."</TE>
<TE>   Other women's winners were Gail Devers in the 100 hurdles (12.81),
Regina Jacobs in the 1,500 (4:11.35) and Jearl Miles Clark in the 400
(50.45). Among the men, the winners included John Godina in the
shotput (70-1 3/4), Kim Collins in the 100 (10.18), Felix Sanchez in
the 400 (45.24) and William Chirchir in the mile (3:55.40).</TE>
<TE>   The meet was a warmup for the U.S. national championships to be
held on the same track in two weeks. Jones will run the 100 and 200
at that event.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wide receiver Keenan McCardell have
agreed to a four-year, $10 million contract, giving the Buccaneers a
proven pass-catcher opposite Keyshawn Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   McCardell had 94 and 93 receptions the last two seasons and
surpassed 1,000 yards in four of his six years with the Jacksonville
Jaguars. He teamed with Jimmy Smith to form the most productive
receiving duo in NFL history over a six-year period (1,061 receptions
from 1996-2001).</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers hope to get similar numbers from Johnson and
McCardell. The contract includes a $2 million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Miami Dolphin wide receiver O.J. McDuffie is suing former
and current team doctors for malpractice and gross negligence in the
treatment of his 1999 big toe injury.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for McDuffie filed a complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court
naming former Dolphin team physician John Uribe, current team
physician Dan Kanell and radiologist Michael Thorpe.</TE>
<TE>   Herman Russomano, McDuffie's lead attorney, said he expects to ask
for a "multimillion dollar" settlement in the case for a "betrayal of
trust."</TE>
<TE>   Released by the Dolphins on Feb. 28 after nine years with the
team, McDuffie contends the injury worsened when he continued to play
with it in 1999. He claims an MRI showed the injury was serious, but
the Dolphins told him the exam was inconclusive.</TE>

<TE>   Harvard celebrated its 16th win in 18 years in the Harvard-Yale
Regatta, routing its rival in the four-mile varsity race by 41.3

<TE>   Harvard dominated the 150th anniversary of the Regatta, coming in
at 19 minutes 2.5 seconds. Yale finished the Thames River event at
19:43.8.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings' Win Is for Aged</HD>
<DH>NHL: Larionov, 41, scores in third overtime to give Detroit
a 3-2 win in third-longest game in Stanley Cup finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Before the Stanley Cup finals began, many expected the matchup
between Detroit and Carolina would be a dull mismatch in favor of the
Red Wings.</LD>
<LD>   After three games, it has been anything but boring.</LD>
<LD>   Igor Larionov, the oldest player on the ice, scored his second
goal of the game with 5:13 remaining in the third overtime to give
the Red Wings a 3-2 victory over the Hurricanes Saturday in the third
longest game in finals' history.</LD>
<TE>   In a game that ended at 1:18 Sunday morning Eastern Daylight Time,
the veteran Red Wings outlasted the younger Hurricanes to take 2-1
lead in the best-of-seven series in front of a raucous sellout crowd
of 18,982 at the Entertainment and Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been involved in a game this long," Detroit Coach
Scotty Bowman said. "Both teams played as hard as they could."</TE>
<TE>   On his winning goal, Larionov, 41, picked up the puck near the
neutral zone, made a couple fakes and then beat goaltender Arturs
Irbe with a backhand shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in two finals and this is my first goal in the finals
... ," Larionov said. "I took my time and just put the puck in the
net. I don't think that I've ever scored a bigger goal. This is the
biggest goal of my career."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina was 74 seconds from a victory, but Detroit's Brett Hull
scored his ninth goal of the playoffs at 18:46 of the third period to
send the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real real tough loss, no question," Carolina Coach Paul
Maurice said. "We played a great game and there's no fault on how we
lost.... We tried to wear them out."</TE>
<TE>   Irbe finished with 50 saves for Carolina, which will host Game 4
on Monday. Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek had 41 saves.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long to tell that the Hurricanes meant business in
Game 3, highlighted by a crushing open ice hit by defenseman Sean
Hill on Detroit's Tomas Holmstrom.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Hurricanes' early aggressiveness came at a price;
they picked up three penalties in the first 12 minutes. But the Red
Wings failed to take advantage despite having three first-period
power plays.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina took the first lead of the game on a highlight play by
forward Josef Vasicek, who had only two goals in 20 playoff games
before Saturday. After the Hurricanes pressured Brendan Shanahan into
a turnover in the Red Wings' zone, Vasicek picked up the loose puck,
eluded defenseman Steve Duchesne with a nifty move and beat Hasek at
14:49 of the first period to put Carolina ahead, 1-0, at 14:49.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't have asked for anything more than that, especially
with the time we spent in the [penalty] box," Hill said about the
Hurricanes' 1-0 lead after one period. "We continued to try and play
on edge and it cost us a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit tied the score, 1-1, early in the second period when
Larionov scored on a four-on-four. After Hill misplayed a puck in
Carolina's zone, Hull picked it up in the left corner and drilled it
toward Larionov, who redirected it past Irbe at 5:43.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings came close to taking their first lead of the game
nearly five minutes into the third when Duchesne hit the right post
with a shot from the blue line. But Carolina's Jeff O'Neill didn't
miss when he had his chance.</TE>
<TE>   With both teams skating a man short, Ron Francis made a perfect
touch pass to O'Neill, who got behind Detroit defenseman Fredrik
Olausson at the blue line and, from the left circle, beat Hasek high
to his glove to give the Hurricanes a 2-1 lead at 7:34.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way the score stood until 1:14 remained in regulation.
With Bowman pulling out all the stops, Hull was able to fight off
Hill and deflect Nicklas Lidstrom's shot from the point to tie the
score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings dominated the first overtime with 11 shots on goal
compared to only five for the Hurricanes. But despite having the
better scoring chances, including a miss on an open net by Shanahan,
Detroit failed to score.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second overtime, Detroit had another great chance to
end the game, but this time Irbe stepped up to make a diving save on
Steve Yzerman with less than four minutes left in the period. But
after controlling the flow for much of the second overtime, the Red
Wings seemed to tire.</TE>

<LD>With six games left in the regular season, the Avengers can set their
sights on making the Arena Football League playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   That's because they don't have to face San Jose again--unless the
teams meet in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   The undefeated SaberCats, who have devoured every team in their
path this year, overcame a nine-point halftime deficit to overrun the
Avengers, 52-33, before 10,122 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   San Jose (8-0) demonstrated that passing isn't the only way to
score, getting five rushing touchdowns--three by Barry Wagner, who
also returned a fourth-quarter interception 19 yards for a score.</TE>
<TE>   SaberCat quarterback Mark Grieb did not have his best night, but
still completed 17 of 32 passes for 179 yards, with one touchdown and
one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Avenger quarterback Tony Graziani had an even tougher time against
the San Jose defense, completing 16 of 36 passes for 106 yards. He
threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second straight loss for Los Angeles, which is 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Graziani completed only three of 17 passes in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Terry</TE>

<TE>   In other AFL games:</TE>

Dallas.... Carlos James caught a go-ahead 10-yard touchdown pass in
the third quarter of the Buffalo's Destroyers' 40-35 victory over the
New York Dragons at Buffalo, N.Y.... Billy Dicken threw four
touchdown passes in less than three quarters as the Chicago Rush
routed the Detroit Fury, 53-17, in Chicago.... Jay McDonagh threw
eight touchdown passes, helping the New Jersey Gladiators to a 70-42
victory over Grand Rapids Rampage at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>

<DL>AKRON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>On a day when Bobby Wadkins was one of only five players in the
Senior PGA Championship field to shoot below par and the only one to
complete 54 holes under par, Jack Nicklaus couldn't make it to the
first tee.</LD>
<LD>   "I was hitting balls [on the practice range] and couldn't get past
the wedge," Nicklaus said Saturday at Firestone Country Club. "I'm
just so darn sore that I can't make a go."</LD>
<LD>   Nicklaus barely made the cut while fighting back and hip pain,
shooting rounds of 71 and 78 to finish 36 holes at nine-over-par 149.</LD>
<TE>   "I was hoping that I could make it but I couldn't even sit down
this morning," Nicklaus said. "Sometimes when I'm on my feet I'm
better."</TE>
<TE>   Wadkins has a one-shot lead at one-under 209 after shooting 69 on
Saturday. Fuzzy Zoeller, Larry Nelson and Roy Vucinich are at 210.
There are 18 players within four strokes of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I can go out there tomorrow and play halfway decent and shoot
72," Wadkins said. "Somebody is four back and they go out and shoot
three- or four-under and we have a ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time since the tournament went to a 72-hole
format in 1958 that only one player was under par through three
rounds.</TE>

<LD>I saw a 2-year-old in a restaurant the other day making a ruckus,
demanding ice cream and disrupting everyone's meal when he didn't get
it, and I got a glimpse of what Tim Leiweke,  point man for the
Anschutz Empire, must have been like as a child.</LD>
<LD>   As tantrums go, the one Leiweke threw last week was a real doozy,
telling folks if the NFL game is not played according to his rules,
he's going to take his football and go home. This was interesting,
because he hasn't even put his ball in play yet.</LD>
<LD>   Despite public perception that the Anschutz Empire has plans to
build a new football stadium near Staples Center and we're going to
have a team here soon, the group is still only investigating the
possibility of building a football stadium near Staples and has made
no final decision.</LD>
<TE>   As I recall, however, crying "you'll be sorry" and then
threatening to pull out was standard operating procedure by the
Anschutz Empire during the process that brought us Staples Center
downtown. I spent a lot of time last week in the building that was
never going to be built.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision to bring a football stadium here, of course, is
predicated on two things: 1) Convincing Philip Anschutz, the Trappist
monk who lives in Denver and has all the money, to give his approval
to Leiweke's plan, and 2) the public, politicians and NFL treating
Leiweke as if he's riding a white horse down Figueroa as our anointed
football leader.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke has yet to get that Anschutz approval, and any disruption,
distraction or roadblock only makes it that much more difficult for
him to make his case, therefore the sound of desperation in his voice
last week.</TE>
<TE>   As for that high horse, excuse me, that white horse, Leiweke
believes he has been riding that for some time as the man who brought
us Staples Center and all the events that have come with it. When he
speaks, he does so like a man who has done everything, with everyone
else left just to admire his handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, who got Staples done? Who made it happen? Me. I did
it. I got Staples done," Leiweke said, while pointing a finger at my
chest. "I got it done."</TE>
<TE>   I remember Ed Roski as the guy who got it done, and kept it from
being built in Inglewood. I remember Anschutz telling me he gave
Roski all the credit for getting Staples Center built downtown. I
guess I remember things differently than Leiweke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LEIWEKE HAS told us the Anschutz Empire is L.A.'s last hope to get
an NFL team, and we know this because Leiweke said so. I believe the
Anschutz Empire is our best hope to get football back, but not
necessarily our only--or last--hope.</TE>
<TE>   That fundamental lack of blind loyalty is at the root of Leiweke's
tantrum. He cannot understand why everything he says is not accepted
as the gospel.</TE>
<TE>   Switching back and forth from brat to bully, Leiweke has made it
clear the Anschutz Empire doesn't have to build a football stadium,
and is only doing so because he thinks of himself as L.A.'s Mother
Teresa.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to do things for the city," he said, and I'm so glad
none of this has anything to do with making more money for the
billionaire who already owns Staples and would like to develop the
real estate in the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   If someone makes life difficult for the Anschutz Empire, Leiweke
said, "we will walk away from this. We don't have to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke hasn't done anything yet--except throw a tantrum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAST WEEK the Coliseum, which is already battling for its soccer
life with the Anschutz Empire, said it would spend $1 million to gain
NFL favor. The Coliseum has already gotten its money's worth, because
as soon as Leiweke heard this, he all but conceded to the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Now you and I know the Coliseum could spend $300 million and the
NFL will still look on it as a dump in a bad neighborhood. I'm tired
of hearing about the Coliseum. But history teaches us a lesson. Three
years ago we were all tired of the Coliseum and NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue was standing in front of the Coliseum, proclaiming it the
new home of L.A.'s expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum is in the business of trying to stay in business,
which makes sense, and yet Leiweke reacted like someone asked him to
lower prices at Staples. He's upset because he doesn't want an NFL
team on the prowl to pit the Coliseum against the Anschutz Empire,
which is the American way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   Sentiment will favor Leiweke in any conflict with the Coliseum. No
one likes the way the Coliseum Commission has conducted itself in the
past, and spending $1 million to get the NFL door slammed in your
face seems like one more ridiculous chapter in Coliseum Commission
lore. The Rose Bowl, though, is doing a similar thing.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke is asking for one thing: unlimited power to do, say and
get whatever he wants. We're supposed to provide this because the
Anschutz Empire got Staples Center built. As far as I'm concerned, no
one is stopping the Anschutz Empire from doing that again.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. did not lose the expansion team to Houston, as Leiweke has
said, because of competing interests here. L.A. lost the expansion
team because a Houston businessman, who had a dream to own a team at
any cost, handed the NFL a check for $700 million, while L.A.
businessmen said that was too rich for them. L.A. did not lose an
expansion team because of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   It all came down to money, and right now Leiweke's brat-to-bully
routine is all about the same thing: driving the best bargain for the
Anschutz Empire.</TE>

<HD>South Africa Sends Slovenia to the Sidelines</HD>

<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>South Africa scored its first World Cup victory Saturday, defeating
Slovenia, 1-0, in front of a crowd of 47,226 and positioning itself
to possibly advance to the final 16.</LD>
<LD>   All the same, 24-year-old forward Siyabonga Nomvethe's
fourth-minute goal was something of a fluke. He stooped to head a
free kick from teammate Quinton Fortune, missed the ball but saw it
bounce off his thigh and into the net.</LD>
<LD>   It was that sort of game for the Slovenians, whose team had come
unraveled earlier in the week when Coach Srecko Katanec and star
forward Zlatko Zahovic got into a shouting match that resulted in the
player being sent home from the World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   Katanec, who has said he will resign after this tournament,
himself was banished from the bench during the game by referee Angel
Sanchez of Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa will play Spain in its final first-round match and
needs only a point to clinch a place in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   It can also advance if Paraguay fails to defeat Slovenia in its
final game Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have scored more," South Africa Coach Jomo Sono said.
"We missed a lot of chances."</TE>
<TE>   One, however, was all it took to make Slovenia the third team
eliminated from the tournament after the earlier falls of Saudi
Arabia and Nigeria.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Outlast Lynx, 76-72</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Mabika's 21 points, Leslie's late scoring carry L.A.
to 10th consecutive victory over Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The defending WNBA champion Los Angeles Sparks continue to frustrate
the Minnesota Lynx.</LD>
<LD>   Mwadi Mabika scored 21 points and Lisa Leslie shook off foul
trouble to score seven points in the final 4 minutes 17 seconds, and
the Sparks defeated the Lynx, 76-72, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lynx are a physical, aggressive team," Spark Coach Michael
Cooper said. "We couldn't just look to one player. We have to be a
five-player team."</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks (5-1) have defeated the Lynx 10 consecutive times and
have never lost at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota won the first meeting between the teams, 86-73, on June
24, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half,
Minnesota pulled within three points three times in the second half,
the last time at 62-59 with 7:03 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Lynx (2-3) could have gotten within two, but Val
Whiting-Raymond missed two free throws with 4:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, who hadn't scored since the first minute because of foul
trouble, made two layups, and Mabika converted a three-point play
with 2:52 to go to put the Sparks ahead, 71-64.</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana Abrosimova scored 23 points to lead the Lynx, and Katie
Smith had 22.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota made only 16 of 31 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the game is making free throws," Abrosimova said. "We
make them during practice. We have no excuses."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, the WNBA's fourth-leading scorer at 19 points per game,
picked up her fifth foul with 11:48 to play. She finished with 10
points.</TE>
<TE>   Abrosimova scored seven points in a 9-0 run that ended the first
half and pulled Minnesota within 41-37.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two more victories and Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers will establish
that they rank among the NBA's greatest with their third consecutive
league title.</LD>
<LD>   Although you won't find many people who believe that New Jersey
will prevent the Lakers from accomplishing this feat, the Nets have
to think that they can. After all, O'Neal could get hurt.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey Coach Byron Scott is hoping that forwards Keith Van
Horn and Kenyon Martin come to play for tonight's Game 3 because he
knows the best-of-seven series would basically be over if the Lakers
were to take a 3-0 lead.</LD>
<TE>   New Jersey cannot be discouraged about O'Neal's dominance in the
Finals. He has done this before. The Nets need to understand that
even if O'Neal scores 40 and Kobe Bryant adds 25, that's only 65
points. They can still win if they shut down the rest of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's easier said than done. A breakdown of Game 3:</TE>
<TE>   NETS' MOVE--Playing at home, New Jersey has to ride the energy of
Continental Airlines Arena to get off to a fast start. In the two
games at Staples Center, the Nets dug huge holes for themselves with
brick-shooting first quarters.</TE>
<TE>   In the playoffs, slow starts at home have not been a problem for
the Nets, who ran out to sizable early leads in games against
Indiana, Charlotte and Boston. Scott should stick with his game plan
of using Kerry Kittles and Lucious Harris more than Jason Kidd in
pick-and-roll situations. Kittles and Harris are more dangerous
shooters than Kidd, but the biggest problem for the Nets has been the
poor shooting of the players who are setting the picks.</TE>
<TE>   If Van Horn and Martin can start making some shots, that will help
open the court for the Nets, who have had good offensive stretches
against the Lakers. Van Horn needs to relax and shoot the ball with
confidence instead of wishing that his shots would fall. Martin has
to remember that it's OK for him to get some points off his offensive
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Los Angeles doesn't have to change anything, except
to play better when O'Neal is on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson must be pleased with the Lakers' ball movement
and their shot selection so far in the series. Derek Fisher has done
a good job of letting the game come to him and Rick Fox has looked as
if he were scrimmaging at the Lakers' El Segundo practice facility.</TE>
<TE>   One thing the Lakers can't afford to do tonight is commit as many
turnovers as they did Friday. O'Neal and Bryant combined for eight of
the team's 14 turnovers, which would be a problem on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Look for the Lakers to do a better job of protecting the ball and
slowing the tempo. Jackson is a master of making sure his team plays
with a killer instinct away from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has done a solid job of frustrating Van Horn and making him
take shots out of rhythm. That's the key to the Lakers' defense. They
make opposing players uncomfortable and force them into shots they do
not want to take. Robert Horry is also great at this tactic.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--The Nets have nothing to lose if they decide to go with
a small lineup tonight. Rookie Richard Jefferson played well Friday
and having him on the court with Kidd, Kittles and possibly Harris
would give the Nets a quicker team.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey is not slowing down O'Neal anyway, and playing against
a smaller team, the Lakers might try to post up players other than
their big man. Another plus for the Nets if they go small would be
their transition game. Kittles may be the fastest guard in the
league, and Kidd isn't too slow himself. The Nets need to get as many
easy baskets as possible if they are to have a chance tonight.</TE>

<HD>Familiar Sight Is Around Corner</HD>
<DH>Group D: U.S. will rely on scouting of assistant coach
Sarachan in crucial game against South Korea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The way Dave Sarachan figures it, he has watched more South Korean
soccer in the last few months than the South Koreans themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "I've gotten to the point where I can see their players' pictures
and know their full names, which is pretty good because there are a
number of names that repeat," Sarachan said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing the Koreans and being able to defeat them are two vastly
different things, but the U.S. assistant coach's knowledge will be
called on frequently Monday when the U.S. plays South Korea at Daegu
in a crucial World Cup match for both teams.</LD>
<TE>   Sarachan, a former player and coach at Cornell, was assigned by
Coach Bruce Arena to become an expert on South Korea's team. It's
something he has been working on since November, and he has a good
feel for the Korean players.</TE>
<TE>   "Since January, they have become a better attacking team," he
said. "They're a much more positive team. They believe in the system
and they believe in themselves, so they're playing with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   They are also playing for a Dutch coach who took the Netherlands
to the semifinals of the France '98 World Cup and who has become as
widely recognized a personality in South Korea as anyone in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Guus Hiddink's photograph appears daily in nearly every newspaper.
Television advertisements feature him prominently. He is shadowed
wherever he goes by a media circus, with reporters hanging on his
every word.</TE>
<TE>   When South Korea played Poland at Busan last week, there was a
50-foot red banner with white letters two feet high decorating the
upper deck of the stadium. Its message was clear:</TE>
<TE>   "HIDDINK MAKE OUR DREAM COME TRUE"</TE>
<TE>   That's the sort of pressure that the Dutchman has on his
shoulders, the dream of an entire nation that wants to see 48 years
of World Cup frustration erased.</TE>
<TE>   The fervor began when South Korea held England to a 1-1 tie in a
warmup game and grew greater when it came close to upsetting world
champion France, before falling, 3-2, on a late goal in another
warmup.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes from the latter match were shown time and again on
television, at least until they were replaced by something better:
scenes from South Korea's 2-0 victory over Poland, a result that
ended a 14-game winless streak in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has speed throughout, excellent finishing ability and
a fitness level that should allow it to endure the searing
temperature of an afternoon match in South Korea's hottest city.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the fans. More than 62,000 of them will pack
the stadium Monday, all wearing red T-shirts with the "Be the Reds"
slogan on the front. The Red Devils' fan group has become so large
and so influential that 45 of its members were invited to a luncheon
Friday by Kim Dae-Jung, the nation's president.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachan said there are several keys for the U.S to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to do a good job of possession," he said.
"Watching them against Poland, Poland didn't do a good job in that
respect. So I think possession is important.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to manage the game well in terms of the pace of
the game. Heat is going to be a factor. But I think the heat doesn't
always play into the hands of teams that pride themselves in being a
relentless, tireless workhorse. So that will help us.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get caught up in a speed-versus-speed mentality, it favors
them a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   As for the crowd, Sarachan said an early goal by the U.S. should
make the fans less of a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole idea against Portugal was to make sure that we got in
at halftime either even or ahead," he said. "We're going to have the
same mentality on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams have hinted at lineup changes, but both coaches are
being coy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in our sport and at this level against these opponents,
you have to be willing to make adjustments, even if you've won with
one team, to give you more of an advantage against the next
opponent," Sarachan said.</TE>

<HD>Going Out the Ultimate Winner</HD>
<DH>College tennis: USC men gave Dick Leach his fourth and
final NCAA championship to remember during his retirement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As farewells go, USC men's tennis Coach Dick Leach enjoyed a tour de
force.</LD>
<LD>   The 62-year-old Leach capped a 23-year career when the Trojans
became the lowest-seeded team to win an NCAA Division I championship
with the victory May 21 at the Texas A&amp;M Tennis Center in College
Station.</LD>
<LD>   "I was in tears," said Leach, who posted a career record 535-133.
"This is the last hurrah. How many coaches get to go out and win the
national championship in their last match? It just can't be any more
special."</LD>
<TE>   Leach had announced April 23 that he would retire at season's end.
The Trojans did their part to hold it off as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   USC (25-5) entered the NCAA Championships seeded No. 11 in the
64-team tournament, but routed Oral Roberts and Arkansas in regional
play to start their stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans then upended No. 4-seeded Baylor, 4-2, No. 3-seeded
Illinois, 4-2, second-seeded Tennessee, 4-3, and top-seeded and
defending-champion Georgia, 4-1, on successive days.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen momentum in basketball and football and volleyball, but
I've never seen so much momentum in tennis," Leach said. "It was like
a runaway freight train."</TE>
<TE>   The national title was USC's 16th in men's tennis and its fourth
under Leach, who this year was selected Intercollegiate Tennis Assn.
coach of the year for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Leach guided the team to titles in 1991, '93 and '94.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is very special because we were such underdogs," said
Leach, who is being replaced by former Pepperdine coach Peter Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Although USC qualified for the NCAA tournament in 22 of Leach's 23
seasons, the Trojans hadn't advanced past the round of 16 since 1996.
Not much more was expected this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We really went in patches. The season was really up and down,"
said Prakash Amritraj, the No. 3 singles player. "I always thought we
were the kind of team that could beat anyone, but we could also lose
to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Not in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to come up big in the big matches," said Andrew
Park, the No. 1 singles player and one of three seniors on the team.
"This was a do-or-die thing for SC. This was the year, with three
seniors, the coach retiring ... "</TE>
<TE>   Park, ranked No. 30 in singles by the ITA, played perhaps his best
match of the year in a 7-5, 6-3 upset of No. 9-ranked Benjamin Becker
of Baylor. Senior Nick Rainey, who advanced to the quarterfinals of
the NCAA individual tournament, won key matches over Illinois' Mike
Kosta and Tennessee's Mark Dietrich.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey was instrumental in rallying support for the Trojans by
purchasing Texas A&amp;M T-shirts that the Trojans wore as they warmed up
before the championship match, swaying any neutral parties in the
crowd of 1,261.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to do something, and people really got behind us," said
senior Ryan Moore, the No. 2 singles player who was leading his match
against the Bulldogs when Amritraj clinched the title.</TE>
<TE>   Leach's sons, Rick and Jon, who each played for their father at
USC, flew to Texas to watch the final against Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Amritraj, a freshman whose father, Vijay, and uncle, Anand, were
longtime Davis Cup players for India in the 1970s, rallied from a 5-3
second-set deficit to beat Georgia's Bo Hodge, 7-6 (3), 7-5, and
clinch the title. He also sealed USC's come-from-behind victories
over Illinois and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   In the 4-3 semifinal victory over Tennessee, USC trailed, 3-1, but
rallied with singles victories by Rainey and Daniel Langre to set the
stage for the No. 85-ranked Amritraj to clinch the Trojans' place in
the final with a 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3 victory over No. 77-ranked Adam
Carey.</TE>
<TE>   "After Tennessee, none of us believed it," Amritraj said. "We were
in such shock. I don't think coach knew what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans got plenty of help throughout the postseason from the
bottom of their lineup as Langre and Ruben Torres each went unbeaten
at No. 5 and No. 6 singles. And for his clutch efforts against
Illinois, Tennessee and Georgia, Amritraj was chosen the NCAA
tournament's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "He played at a level we haven't seen before," Leach said.</TE>
<TE>   "You win, and it's an incredible feeling. But the journey is where
it's at, and if I could bottle and sell the joy I'm feeling right
now, I'd make a million dollars."</TE>

<HD>Arena Expecting Stern Test From South Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>U.S. Coach Bruce Arena believes South Korea will present a different
set of challenges Monday than Portugal did in the Americans' first
game.</LD>
<LD>   "Korea is a team that has tremendous organization, great
athleticism and fitness over 90 minutes and will test us in every
part of the field," he said Saturday. "Additionally, they've
developed their attacking play quite well over the last four weeks or
so. They're very dangerous on the break and excellent on restarts."</LD>
<LD>   Forward Brian McBride, whose goal in the 3-2 victory over Portugal
made him the only U.S. player in history to score in two World Cups,
said that the heat here--game-time temperatures are expected to be in
the mid-80s--and the overwhelmingly pro-Korean crowd of 62,000 will
not be factors.</LD>
<TE>   "[When we] play in Mexico City in Azteca Stadium in front of
110,000 fans blowing horns, it feels like we're being swarmed by
bumblebees," he said. "Although it's an incredible atmosphere, it's
just a soccer game. So you have to concentrate on playing soccer and
tune everything else out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of anti-American demonstrations surrounding the
game or of crowd trouble should South Korea be beaten by the U.S. was
dismissed by Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that we're allies with the South Koreans," he
said. "I've been up to the DMZ and watched our soldiers work shoulder
to shoulder [with Korean troops] in a very friendly and professional
manner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where it [the rumor of potential trouble] is coming
from. Somebody alluded to the fact that it had to do with the Winter
Olympics [and the controversy over the gold medal in short-track
speedskating], but we're not aware of any political issues. We
consider the South Koreans our friends."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injured midfielders Claudio Reyna and Earnie Stewart remain
questionable starters for Monday's game and the decision on whether
either will play will not be made until then.</TE>
<TE>   "It's day to day," Arena said. "We'll see how they improve. I'm
very pleased the way Earnie is moving along.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not ready for the game on Monday, I believe he will be
ready for the last game [against Poland on Friday]. Claudio is moving
along equally well and we're hopeful he'll be ready to play on
Monday."</TE>

<PH>NBA PLAYOFFS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS/ SERIES REPORT</PH>
<KH>OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>Re-Signing Kidd Is Key for Nets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE VACCARO</AU>
<BD>NEWARK STAR-LEDGER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers have already done their part in turning these NBA Finals
to dust, throttling what should have been the grandest week in New
Jersey's basketball history, sucking all the mystery out of the
series.</LD>
<LD>   The shame of that extends beyond whether the Nets can steal a game
at the Meadowlands this week, thereby granting the locals three
chances to witness the NBA Finals in their backyard, rather than the
two the rest of the basketball world has already consigned them.</LD>
<LD>   Because once the Finals end, the Nets will engage in a new kind of
grueling fun, a parlor game that will extend across 13 torturous
months. You can play along, too, slipping on one of those wristbands
favored by so many basketball players and altering ever so slightly
the meaning of "W.W.J.D."</LD>
<TE>   To this: "What Will Jason Do?"</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd has been nothing if not consistent in his replies to
the incessant questions about his future. Yes, he says, his family
likes it in New Jersey. Yes, he likes his teammates. No, he has no
intention of waiving his contractual right to free agency. No, he
will not allay your fears even one day sooner. He's going to see
what's Out There.</TE>
<TE>   Get used to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is definitely going to be the last contract I sign
as a pro basketball player and I just want to make certain it's the
right decision, for me and for my family," Kidd said the other day.
It was only the latest version of the same speech he's delivered
since July, the observations of a careful basketball diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, I asked Net President Rod Thorn--whose happy
mission it will be to play the point man in this year-long quest to
lock up his point guard--if this reminds him of talking to the
prettiest girl in high school, wondering if she really likes you or
is just being nice to you.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Thorn said with a laugh. "It's much more important than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd has revealed only one clue about what the winning bidder must
offer for him to sign at the bottom of a loaded contract in July
2003: A chance to win an NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   So where does that leave the Nets?</TE>
<TE>   On the precipice of the most important summer in franchise
history.</TE>
<TE>   To bump the Nets closer to the Lakers' class, Thorn needs to land
an Antonio McDyess, a Vin Baker, maybe even a Kevin Garnett, whose
name has circulated in mega-deal possibilities the last few weeks.
But altering the makeup of this roster means parting with some of the
players who helped build this remarkable run.</TE>
<TE>   But no gamble is too great if it keeps Kidd happy, and if it makes
the Nets more competitive in the Finals the next time around.
Especially since, without Kidd, it will be a long, lonely time before
there ever is a next time around.</TE>

<LD>Shannon Johnson scored 15 of her franchise-record 35 points after
regulation and the Orlando Miracle beat the Cleveland Rockers,
103-99, in triple overtime Saturday night before 7,255 at Orlando,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson played 51 minutes, making 11 of 15 shots and 11 of 12 free
throws.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't start off very good, but my teammates stayed with me the
whole night," said Johnson, whose 11 points in the final overtime
topped her output in the first half by two.</LD>
<TE>   Jessie Hicks added a career-high 18 points, eight in the overtime
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando (3-1), which set a franchise record for points, made 28 of
32 free throws in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson made four free throws over the final 15 seconds, as the
Miracle made all eight foul shots in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Taylor scored 27 points to lead Cleveland, 12 after
regulation for the Rockers (1-2).</TE>
<TE>   Utah 69, Charlotte 64--The Starzz held the Sting to only one
basket during a six-minute span late in the game before a crowd of
7,258 at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   With the Starzz (3-2) holding a 63-62 lead, Natalie Williams
missed two free throws with 21.9 seconds left, but LaTonya Johnson
grabbed the rebound. Johnson, who had not attempted a free throw all
season, calmly made both shots for a 65-62 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Summer Erb made a baseline jumper, only the second basket for the
Sting (2-2) in the last 6:30, but the Starzz clinched the win as
Adrienne Goodson and Marie Ferdinand made four free throws in the
last 12.8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Azzi scored 10 of her 12 points in the second half as
Utah ended a two-game losing skid.</TE>
<TE>   Foul trouble hurt Charlotte down the stretch as Charlotte Smith
and Tammy Sutton-Brown both fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton-Brown had 14 points and 10 rebounds while Smith scored 13.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 71, New York 62--Rookie Tamika Catchings had season highs
with 32 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Fever (3-2) before 7,021
at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty (4-2) went on a 13-2 run midway through the second
half to tie it, 49-49. But Catchings scored eight points as the Fever
responded with a 16-6 run over the next five minutes and went ahead,
65-55, with 1:20 left.</TE>

<LD>Bud Selig remembers the morning in August of 1998 when he read about
Mark McGwire and androstenedione.</LD>
<LD>   "I was shocked," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Then, on his way to his office at Milwaukee's County Stadium, the
baseball commissioner stopped to do a family errand.</LD>
<TE>   "I walked into a pharmacy where we've done business for 25, 30
years. The pharmacist knows me very well. As soon as I walked in, he
says, 'Commissioner, I know why you're here. There it is, right over
there.' "</TE>
<TE>   The pharmacist guided the commissioner to a shelf of little
bottles filled with the kind of little pills that some cynics called
Big Mac's Little Helpers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget it," Selig says. "I said to the pharmacist, 'If
it's sold over the counter, how bad can it be?' He says, 'Well, I
wouldn't let my kids take it, that's all I'll tell you.' And I could
see the look on his face."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to 'Roid World.</TE>
<TE>   Where muscle comes out of a needle.</TE>
<TE>   Where home runs come out of a little bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Where old romantics/innocents named Bud Selig call a routine
meeting of major league club physicians--this was in December
2000--and get an unexpected earful of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "'They expressed concern to me about steroids on their teams,"
Selig says, adding that the doctors presented no data. "I just heard
what you hear, what we all hear.... But after that meeting, I was
even more concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes Jose Canseco.</TE>
<TE>   Too irresponsible to be taken seriously even when he was a
superstar, he now promises/threatens an autobiography in which he
reports that 85 percent of major league players use steroids. But
about himself he won't say, so we mostly ignore him.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes Sports Illustrated with Ken Caminiti's story. There's
no ignoring Caminiti, the National League's 1996 MVP.</TE>
<TE>   He indicts himself as an alcoholic, cocaine addict and steroid
user. He says the big-leaguers-on-juice number is 50 percent.</TE>
<TE>   What's next? A pitcher dead, killed by a rocket off a user's bat?</TE>
<TE>   The wonder is it hasn't happened. The fear is it'll happen soon.</TE>
<TE>   In SI's extraordinary report on steroid use in baseball, Rangers
pitcher Kenny Rogers says he has ordered his wife, if he's the dead
one, to file suit because "everybody in baseball knows what's been
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Selig holds a photocopy of the story as he says, "When I read
Kenny Rogers' comment that somebody's going to get killed on the
mound, well, that's a horrifying thought. So I've told our people we
just can't sit idly by anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Into the boiling caldron of the current labor-management
negotiations, then, circumstance drops steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "No question about it, it will be an absolutely critical part,"
Selig says. "This is not an owner problem, not a players association
problem. This is a baseball problem. This is us.</TE>
<TE>   "What can be more important than the health and welfare of
players? Nothing. So should I sit here and make believe it doesn't
exist? No. We'd have had testing two to three years ago if I'd had my
way."</TE>
<TE>   It's laughable to hear a player say, "Test me, test me, test me
all you want."</TE>
<TE>   He knows how the juice works. He gets it in the winter to bulk up.
Then he turns to flexibility workouts. During the season, he does
lifting to maintain the added muscle mass. So, yeah, he says, "Test
me, test me, I'm clean. Come watch me work out, you'll see how I got
this body."</TE>
<TE>   Testing is meaningless if done at the invitation of the steroid
user, who knows the stuff moves through his body quickly, who knows
he doesn't have to use it for months at a time, maybe not at all from
April to October.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the world's Olympic officials have been given the
extraordinary power to do unannounced random testing of any athlete
anywhere, anytime. They can knock on a gold medalist's door at
midnight during her vacation in Mauritius and say, "Here's a bottle.
I'll watch."</TE>
<TE>   Minor league baseball players know the feeling. Because they're
not members of the Major League Baseball Players Association, which
long has refused testing, minor leaguers are subject to a
drug-testing program.</TE>
<TE>   That program calls for three in-season tests as well as
unannounced off-season tests. A Major League Baseball source's
estimate of minor leaguers who test positive for steroids: 10 percent
to 20 percent.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco's 85 percent is fool's talk. Caminiti has backed away from
his 50 percent, now even saying baseball is clean. But something is
happening, likely something above the minor league's 10 percent to 20
percent. Human nature says so.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, we have eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know life's better," Selig says. "We have better vitamins,
better food, better diets, better exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "But growing up in another era, as I did, thinking back now on
Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Stan Musial, Red
Schoendienst, Ted Williams. Even Mickey Mantle, as well built as
Mantle was, he didn't look like these guys look today. And my guy,
Joe DiMaggio, was thin.''</TE>
<TE>   Then, Selig says, look at today's bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "And you're saying to yourself, 'Holy mackerel. OK, even given all
the advantages of technology being accelerated today, what is it?' "</TE>
<TE>   Sad to say, now we know.</TE>
<TE>   It's the juice.</TE>

<HD>This Is No Fish Story: $1 Million Grand Prize</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament is one of the
world's oldest and richest deep-sea fishing events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMERY P. DALESIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MOREHEAD CITY, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A small flotilla of big-game fishing boats will chug out of port in a
hunt for a $1 million prize and a sea creature that's a silvery-blue
torpedo of muscle bigger than a bear.</LD>
<LD>   The 44th annual Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament is one of the
world's oldest and richest deep-sea fishing events. But it remains
largely unknown to those outside the sport.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Adrian Holler's 61-foot yacht out of Newport, N.C.,
landed a 515-pound marlin and claimed $942,100, a record payout for
the Big Rock tourney. Compare that to pro golfer Reteif Goosen, who
received $900,000 for winning the U.S. Open a few days later.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, deep-sea fishing events are more expensive and harder
for the average person to try. And for spectators, there's little to
see when the competition is 50 miles out in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, there are probably fewer than 20,000 competitive
offshore anglers competing in about 80 events, according to the
International Game Fish Association in Dania Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   But here and at a handful of similar events around the globe,
contestants are willing to pay dearly for the right to battle a fish
that has inspired barroom boasts, seafarer legends and, in
literature, Ernest Hemingway's epic battle of man versus nature in
"The Old Man and The Sea."</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like fighting a marlin, to me. It's so exciting.
When one of those fish hit and the line starts screaming, it's just
hard to describe," says Ted Garner, who has entered the past 14
contests and whose family has owned the Sanitary Restaurant here for
decades. "You've got to live it and you've got to be able to afford
it."</TE>
<TE>   A blue marlin can grow into a monster more than 16 feet long and
weighing more than 1,300 pounds, though most are smaller. Big Rock
tournament rules require that marlins under 9 feet long or 400 pounds
be freed.</TE>
<TE>   When they're hooked, they may shoot straight up out of the water
or arc repeatedly over the waves trying to get loose.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes your jaw drop open," says Garner's son, Jeff, who
captains their 56-foot boat Yellowfin.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Monday, about 200 boats will spend four of the next six
days searching the Gulf Stream off the North Carolina coast for
marlin heading north as summer approaches and waters warm.
Competitors are required to choose two days to stay dockside.</TE>
<TE>   The entry fee per boat to qualify for all prize levels is $8,250
and--like cash tossed into the pot at a poker game--the number of
those willing to play determines the size of the purse.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more variables in fishing than there is playing a
game of cards. Basically, I guess, the objective is the same--to win
the pot or to catch a winning fish," says Ted Garner. "I've never
been in a poker game where you could win $350,000, $400,000."</TE>
<TE>   That's just the start of the spending that will flow.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers estimate the 200 or so boats entered each year spend
$2.9 million--or more than $14,400 per boat on fuel, dock fees, bait,
motels and meals. The Garners spent $800 last week just to have five
reels serviced and restrung.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big deal. You don't buy hot dogs and those premade
sandwiches" to feed these crews, says Tommy Bennett, a motel owner
and former county tourism board member who tallied the tournament's
local economic impact.</TE>
<TE>   Money from sponsors--most selling boating gear--are used to help
local charities. Last year, $115,000 went to groups that provide free
medical care to the poor, help battered women and others.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 201 boats that entered the Big Rock last year,
three-fourths were from North Carolina. The rest came from every East
Coast state from Florida to Massachusetts except Rhode Island, plus
one each from Ohio and Bermuda. In the past, anglers from Canada,
Mexico, France and Japan also battled for prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament organizers don't shy away from telling contestants that
they're hunting for a species that is considered severely overfished,
with populations in the Atlantic 40 percent of the level needed to
maintain healthy members. Blue marlin also range across the Pacific
and Indian oceans.</TE>
<TE>   About 95 percent of the marlins killed are taken indiscriminately
by commercial fishing ships hunting for tuna and swordfish, according
to a United Nations-chartered organization charged with managing tuna
and billfish in the Atlantic's international waters.</TE>
<TE>   The culprits are the enormous nets hauled behind commercial
vessels that scoop up acres of marine life.</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of mortality, some conservationists don't want any
blue marlin killed for the sake of a contest.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament organizers penalize boats that bring in an undersized
marlin by counting the dead fish's weight against the rest of their
catch.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, all but three of the 47 marlins or sailfish hooked in
the Big Rock were released.</TE>

<HD>Making a Pitch at Quarterback</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Cowboys hope to mold former pro pitcher into
NFL player, although he hasn't played since sophomore season at
Stanford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN HAWKINS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Chad Hutchinson stands in the glaring sun long after most of his
teammates have left the practice field. He keeps flinging footballs,
trying to solve the flaw in his motion that keeps sending them wide
of his target.</LD>
<LD>   The rust on his powerful right arm is understandable. The
25-year-old rookie quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys hasn't played a
football game in four years. He's spent the time away trying to throw
fastballs past major and minor leaguers.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the Cowboys felt strong enough about his ability that they
outbid several other clubs and immediately made him the backup to
unproven second-year starter Quincy Carter.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no question that he is raw," said quarterbacks coach
Wade Wilson. "But he certainly has a ton of upside and potential, and
that is what we are hoping to tap. It's an ongoing process."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson is no eager-eyed rookie. He's already had a close-up
view of the circus surrounding Mark McGwire when he was baseball's
single-season home run king, and he's spent time with Roger Staubach,
who also took time off from football between college and a Hall of
Fame career with the Cowboys. Troy Aikman has watched him practice
and Hutchinson's locker is next to Emmitt Smith's.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1999, Hutchinson was called up to the majors by the
St. Louis Cardinals and became teammates with McGwire, who was on his
way to hitting 65 homers one year after becoming the first player to
reach 70.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of my all-time favorite experiences in sports, being
around him and the team in that situation," Hutchinson said. "To
learn to deal with that, dealing with the pressures, it was big."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Hutchinson hasn't played football since his sophomore
season at Stanford in 1997, the Cowboys have guaranteed him $5
million for three years and cut Ryan Leaf to clear a spot on the
depth chart. Hutchinson said the team's confidence in him is "a
mystery to me, too."</TE>
<TE>   The belief starts with his size--6-foot-4, 225 pounds--and solid
mental makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Questions start with him never having faced a blitzing NFL
linebacker at full speed. At off-season minicamps, the latest being
the past week, Hutchinson hasn't had to worry about getting hit while
learning plays and making throws.</TE>
<TE>   He's also adjusting to moving targets, such as the swift duo of
Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail, instead of trying to throw 96 mph
fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   While he has impressed the Cowboys with his strong arm and ability
to throw deep, he is still trying to regain his accuracy and relearn
the football routine. The adjustments are frustrating, yet Hutchinson
knows he still has time to get back in the groove.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like baseball where you need 300 innings pitched to
really know what you can be as a pitcher," Hutchinson said. "You can
make up ground a lot quicker in football because you are out there
practicing, where in baseball it's a game-time thing."</TE>
<TE>   In learning the offense, Hutchinson is on equal footing with
Carter, an eight-game starter in an injury-plagued rookie season. New
offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, hired days after Hutchinson
signed in January, is installing a West Coast offense.</TE>
<TE>   The system is much more complex with its multiple formations, but
the basics are similar to what Hutchinson ran at Stanford. In 23
college starts, he completed 379 of 627 passes (60 percent) for 4,235
yards with 20 touchdowns and 22 interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "With a new system going in, that's an advantage," Cowboys Coach
Dave Campo said. "It's not like you have to take a guy that's been
doing something and change the way he drops. He's moldable, and that
is a positive.</TE>
<TE>   The rawness, I don't know if that's a positive, but the idea of a
guy that is coachable is.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets better every camp. He gets a little more confident in
what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson gave up football after two varsity seasons when the St.
Louis Cardinals took him in the second round of the June 1998 draft.
He's the second-oldest child among five of a single mother, and
becoming an instant millionaire was too good to refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "The decisions I made, I spent a lot of time thinking about, and
at the time, the needs of the family and the needs of where I was as
an athlete were such that I needed to go to baseball," he said. "I
don't choose to look back and say I wish I would have done it
differently."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson never made it to the mound during his '99 call-up. His
debut had to wait until April 2001. He made three appearances over a
13-day span and allowed three home runs and 11 earned runs in four
innings for a 24.75 ERA. He then went back to the minors and realized
his passion for football was still there.</TE>
<TE>   Others weren't surprised. Dana Bible, his offensive coordinator at
Stanford, always teased Hutchinson that he was a football player
playing baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see it on the mound with his demeanor, athletic
confidence and the way he carried himself," said Bible, now at Boston
College.</TE>
<TE>   When Hutchinson decided to pursue football again, about 20 NFL
teams showed interest. Representatives from many of those teams,
including the Cowboys on several occasions, talked to Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot of natural ability, he is a tremendous competitor
and he's like a sponge as far as coaching him," Bible said. "He has a
tremendous upside. That's the bottom line, and the Cowboys saw that.
I think it will prove to be a great move for them."</TE>
<TE>   When Bible arrived at Stanford with coach Tyrone Willingham in
1995, Hutchinson already had been recruited to play baseball. The new
staff scrambling for recruits was willing to take a chance on the
two-sport athlete whose only varsity season was with a run-oriented
team.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson made a quick impression during two-a-day drills. With
the play breaking down as he moved to his left, he stopped, planted
and made a strong throw on target back to his right.</TE>
<TE>   "The head coach, all of the assistants and the athletic director
who was at practice all found each other in one glance," Bible said.
"Suddenly, we were able to think about the possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, the Cowboys are thinking the same thing.</TE>

<HD>A Horrible Accident and Its Aftermath</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: One moment a young policeman was talking to his
wife; the next, he was severely injured. Incident would test doctors,
family.</DH>
<SE>First in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>Phoenix</DL>
<LD>*</LD>
<LD>   PHOENIX -- He had been a cop only a few months when he was called
to his first major fire. An apartment was engulfed, and a bystander
shouted that someone could be inside. Another officer ran to the back
of the building while Jason Schechterle stood at the front alone,
facing the flames, feeling the heat.</LD>
<LD>   The fire devoured everything in its path. He couldn't see walls,
couldn't see ceiling, couldn't see furniture--only the inferno.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Jason peered through a window. Two bodies lay on a
charred bed, skeletons without hair, skin, features. Nothing that
resembled a human being.</TE>
<TE>   "God," he thought, "what a way to die."</TE>
<TE>   Fire had always been among his greatest fears.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cruising the nighttime streets of Phoenix, the 28-year-old
policeman punched the numbers into his cell phone, calling home.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen you in God only knows how long," Jason Schechterle
cooed to his wife, Suzie.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a lot of making up to do, buddy," she teased.</TE>
<TE>   It was their nightly call, a ritual since Jason joined the Phoenix
Police Department 14 months earlier. Suzie had opposed his idea to
quit the power company and join the force; she was worried,
naturally. But when Jason offered to give up his dream for her, she
had to support him.</TE>
<TE>   The phone calls helped calm her nerves, and on this night, March
26, 2001, they were even more flirtatious than usual. Jason had
stayed over at his partner's house the day before to help install a
sprinkler system. Now he had just two hours left on duty before
heading home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna get in bed and snuggle right up next to you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hold you to it," Suzie said, laughing, more like a
schoolgirl than a 30-year-old mother of two.</TE>
<TE>   Then the emergency tone sounded across Jason's patrol car radio,
and a call came crackling in.</TE>
<TE>   "Unknown trouble. 2735 East Thomas," the dispatcher intoned.</TE>
<TE>   No response.</TE>
<TE>   The dispatcher repeated the call and gave a rundown: Dried blood
inside an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Again, no response.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't in his immediate area. It would surely mean working
late. But it sounded like a possible dead body, and no one was
responding.</TE>
<TE>   Jason put Suzie on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "513 Henry," he radioed. "I'll start up."</TE>
<TE>   He went back to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby, I need to go. I'm en route."</TE>
<TE>   Jason flipped on his lights.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11:17 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, groceries in hand, Lawrence Tracy hailed a cab to
head home from the market.</TE>
<TE>   "24th Street and Thomas," he said, climbing in.</TE>
<TE>   The cab turned onto Thomas Road, but suddenly jerked and ran up on
a curb.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you OK?" Tracy asked, but the driver said nothing. Instead,
the cab picked up speed, lurching down the street as light poles and
signs whizzed by.</TE>
<TE>   "Slow down!" Tracy pleaded. The driver didn't respond.</TE>
<TE>   The cab flew through several green lights. Then Tracy saw the next
light, at 20th Street and Thomas, change.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow ...</TE>
<TE>   The car in front slowed to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   Red ...</TE>
<TE>   The cab swerved to avoid the vehicle. To its left, a police car
was stopped with its lights on.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy grabbed the seat and braced for impact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Fire Engine No. 5 also had just been dispatched. It wasn't
an emergency, so when a light at a highway exit ramp near 20th and
Thomas turned red, the truck rolled to a stop.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11:21 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there was a fireball.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Michael Ore's crew jumped out of the engine and began
unraveling the hose. Then Ore saw the flashing lights.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the scene of a 962 ... !" he shouted into the radio,
giving the code for an accident with injuries. "Give me a first-alarm
medical. Police car involved."</TE>
<TE>   And then: "Trapped victim!"</TE>
<TE>   Flames licked at the broken frame of the patrol car, its back seat
crushed by the impact. Inside, thick black smoke formed like a storm
cloud in the front seat. Ore couldn't see through it, but he knew
someone was inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurry up!" he yelled to his crew. "There's a man burning to death
in there!"</TE>
<TE>   Darren Boyce aimed the hose inside the car, while rookie Henry
Narvaez fought to open the driver's door. "I can't get it open!"
Narvaez shouted as a small explosion ripped through the right side of
the car, sending flames shooting in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   Ore tossed an ax to Narvaez, who broke through the window. Boyce
kept the flames at bay, but the front seat was smoldering beneath the
smoke and steam. The stench of melted plastic filled Ore's nostrils
as he and Narvaez tugged at the officer, fighting to free him.</TE>
<TE>   But he was still strapped into his seat belt, and they couldn't
get to the latch.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a knife!" Ore screamed.</TE>
<TE>   A policeman who'd just arrived sliced through the seat belt, while
a second officer loosened the legs. Together the men pulled the
officer through the window just as an ambulance drove up.</TE>
<TE>   As they shoved him onto the gurney, a piece of skin peeled off the
officer's arm -- revealing a small patch of white on an otherwise
blackened man. Ore, a 26-year veteran, was stricken.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we did this guy a favor," he thought as the
ambulance pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suzie Schechterle never heard the doorbell. She only remembers
being jostled awake and opening her eyes to the sight of her
husband's partner, Bryan Chapman. He'd been let in by her mother, who
was visiting.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie knew the deal Jason and Bryan had made when they joined the
force. If something happened to either of them, the other would
notify his wife. And now here was Bryan, kneeling at her bedside.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie sat up on her knees, cupped her hands to her mouth and let
out a shriek.</TE>
<TE>   "No-o-o!"</TE>
<TE>   "Jason's been in a very bad accident," Bryan was saying. "Another
car hit him. He's in bad shape."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie called her ex-husband to watch over their 7-year-old
daughter, Kiley, and 2-year-old Zane, her son with Jason.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at Maricopa Medical Center, she had no idea what she was
in for. As Bryan led her through the emergency room and into the
bowels of the hospital, she didn't see the placard reading "Arizona
Burn Center."</TE>
<TE>   The waiting area was a sea of police uniforms, and it parted as
Suzie passed through. She noticed the police chaplain. Was her
husband dead?</TE>
<TE>   Bryan led her through some double doors to a sink, where someone
washed her hands. She wasn't sure why. She heard a mention of fire,
and thought that perhaps Jason had been singed. The corridor smelled
of rotten eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Ushered into a conference room, she saw Jason's parents, brother
and sister.</TE>
<TE>   Then a burly man in aqua operating scrubs walked in, Dr. Daniel
Caruso. The brusque, plainspoken chief of the Arizona Burn Center
held nothing back.</TE>
<TE>   "Your husband sustained third-degree, if not worse, burns to his
head," he told Suzie, explaining that much of Jason's face had been
lost to the fire. The ears. The nose. The hands were bad too.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remove the burns," he finished, "or he'll have no
chance of survival."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso pushed some forms in front of Suzie and told her to sign.
There was no time to waste.</TE>
<TE>   He asked if she wanted to see her husband, but Suzie knew she
couldn't. Not like this. Just hours earlier, she had said it all. He
knew how much she loved him.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," she begged, grabbing Caruso before he left. "Whatever
you have to do, just save him."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do my best," the doctor replied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The team had assembled: Caruso and Dr. Kevin Foster, co-directors
of the burn unit, and Dr. Clifford Smith, the chief resident.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and Smith had been at home, getting ready for bed, when
their pagers went off. Once they got to the hospital, they called in
Foster for another pair of hands. None of them had ever seen anything
like this.</TE>
<TE>   The burns had consumed the skin, tissue and fat in Jason's head,
face and neck. His forehead was scorched right through to the skull.
His hands were seared down to the tendons.</TE>
<TE>   When Caruso first got to the hospital, he ran his gloved hands
over Jason's head. It was hard as oak--a sign of fourth-degree burns,
as severe as they get. Third-degree burns sear through every skin
layer; fourth-degree burns go further, eating through other tissue
and fat.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso was surprised this patient was alive. If a person's whole
head is burned, the airway usually gets clogged with smoke. It swells
shut, and he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   But, at least in terms of timing, everything had worked in Jason's
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters happened to be on the scene when the accident
occurred. An ambulance arrived just as they cut him out, and an
airway was quickly established. And he was young, only 28, and in
good shape.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's mind raced. As serious as the injuries were, the
treatment was the same as for any severe burn: Remove the dead skin
and graft over it with new skin. Usually, he would wait a few days
before beginning the excision to see how the burns progressed, but
these were already too serious.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor knew if he didn't operate immediately, infection would
set in and Jason could die.</TE>
<TE>   In a stark white chamber, a priest performed last rites as Jason
lay on a table under a spotlight. A feeding tube snaked into his
stomach, while a tracheotomy tube extended from his neck to help him
breathe.</TE>
<TE>   The room was stifling. Temperatures climbing above 90 degrees were
necessary to compensate for any drop in Jason's body temperature due
to the loss of skin.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso took his place at the end of the table, ready to begin on
the top of Jason's head. Foster and Smith lined up alongside the
face. Using handheld knife blades akin to cheese graters, the doctors
went to work, peeling back layer upon layer of scorched skin.</TE>
<TE>   They were looking for any sign of life beneath the burns. Dead
tissue resembles worn leather. Healthy tissue looks like medium-rare
steak.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy tissue bleeds.</TE>
<TE>   With each swipe, the realization set in of just how badly this
patient was injured. With each swipe, there was no blood.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso traded the blade for an electronic, pen-sized instrument
that cuts even deeper. He sliced through a swath of skin, and pulled
it from Jason's head.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no blood.</TE>
<TE>   Slice, pull. No blood.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Just what the hell are we doing here?" he demanded, unable to
mask his own disgust. "We're about to take off this guy's entire
face."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the doctor knew if there was a way to save him, this was
it. He worked on, though his misgivings would not go away.</TE>
<TE>   We're removing this guy's complete identity, he thought. We're
going to subject him to surviving this.</TE>
<TE>   Each doctor was thinking the same thing: If it were him on the
table, he'd rather die.</TE>
<TE>   None of them had ever excised burns this deep from a man's head
and face. They had no idea what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   But they had no choice, either: A doctor's duty is to do
everything possible. ...</TE>
<TE>   Slice, pull. No blood.</TE>
<TE>   Like Caruso, Foster and Smith switched instruments and kept
working.</TE>
<TE>   In the hot operating room, hours passed as more skin came off, and
the surgeons' few words grew more and more grim.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not bleeding," one groaned.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing," said another.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, I'm down to muscle."</TE>
<TE>   And then: "I'm down to bone."</TE>
