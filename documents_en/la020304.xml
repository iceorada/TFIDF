<HD>Ani DiFranco Creates Lyrical Protests</HD>

<LD>More funk, less punk. Ani DiFranco always goes her own way, and right
now that frequently means blowing up her folk-based songs with a big
jazzy funk sound that even extends to the occasional outburst of scat
singing.</LD>
<LD>   She's no musical dilettante. At the Grove in Anaheim on Saturday,
DiFranco often stepped away from her five-piece band, still
comfortable alone with an acoustic guitar, singing and shouting
lyrics that were biting and vulnerable and alarming and funny all at
once. But her new commitment to broader musical strokes were genuine
and effective.</LD>
<LD>   Her current U.S. tour offers a notable shift from the indie
rock/folk music she first created at the beginning of the '90s. Her
"Revelling/Reckoning" album offers two discs of rich musical twists,
as if working to keep up with her substantial, if subtle, development
as an acoustic guitarist. She's equally powerful during the quietest
moments as when the band is at full throttle.</LD>
<TE>   As during her best '90s work (such as 1996's "Dilate"), DiFranco
mixed emotion and graphic detail at the Grove without overloading the
songs. She could be angry and genuinely funny at the same moment, or
vulnerable and iron-willed in the face of personal or political
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the show, DiFranco dialed down her band to quiet waves of
sound as she recited a Beat-styled poem/lecture on the lasting
implications of the Sept. 11 attacks, with razor-edged indictments on
villains both inside and outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   It was a leftist indictment for a litany of offenses, questioning
the legitimacy of George W. Bush's election and the influence of the
oil industry, declaring: "Here's to our last drink of fossil fuel/May
we get off that sauce."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, that kind of statement would have been unremarkable
beyond the power and focus of its delivery. But it's hard to imagine
many major artists, from rock to hip-hop, would be willing to make
such a withering indictment of contemporary U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   That fearlessness extends to shifting styles in the face of fan
expectations. Not everyone wants their favorite folk tunes
transformed into big funk. But DiFranco remains the ultimate indie
rocker. Her fans have learned to cope.</TE>

<HD>A 'Soldiers' March to Top Spot</HD>
<DH>Box Office* The Mel Gibson Vietnam War drama opens with an
estimated $20.2 million. 'Queen of the Damned,' last week's No. 1, is
sixth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two new films dealing with vastly different forms of sacrifice--war
and abstinence--grabbed the top spots at the North American weekend
box office, according to studio estimates issued Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Mel Gibson Vietnam War saga "We Were Soldiers" opened at No. 1
with $20.2 million, which was at the lower end of Paramount Pictures'
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The sex comedy "40 Days and 40 Nights" bowed at No. 2 with $12.5
million, which a Miramax spokesman said was on target. In the film,
Josh Hartnett plays a jilted lover who gives up sex for the titular
period to get over his ex-girlfriend.</LD>
<TE>   Last weekend's No. 1 film, the vampire thriller "Queen of the
Damned," tumbled to No. 6 with $5.8 million, taking its 10-day total
to $23.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The top five was rounded out by the Denzel Washington hostage
thriller "John Q." (New Line Cinema) at No. 3, with $8.4 million,
followed by the Kevin Costner supernatural drama "Dragonfly"
(Universal Pictures), with $6.8 million, and the Peter Pan sequel
"Return to Never Land" (Walt Disney Pictures), with $6.5 million.
Each fell one spot.</TE>
<TE>   The top 12 films grossed $81 million, according to box-office
tracking firm Exhibitor Relations, down 4% from last weekend but up
8% from the year-ago period, when "The Mexican" was tops with $20.1
million.</TE>
<TE>   If estimates hold when final data are issued today, "We Were
Soldiers" will beat "The Mexican's" record for a film opening in the
first weekend of March."We Were Soldiers" stars Gibson as an officer
who leads 400 men into the first major battle of the Vietnam War, at
Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The $70-million film was based on the memoir
"We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young" and was adapted, directed and
produced by Randall Wallace, who wrote Gibson's "Braveheart."</TE>
<TE>   Following "Behind Enemy Lines," "Black Hawk Down" and "Hart's
War," "We Were Soldiers" could have suffered from moviegoer fatigue
with war films, said Wayne Lewellen, president of distribution at
Paramount. The Viacom Inc.-owned studio had targeted an opening of
$20 million to $25 million, but Lewellen was still pleased with the
number.</TE>
<TE>   Male viewers made up about 56% of the audience, but the film
skewed older--almost three-quarters of viewers were older than 25.</TE>
<TE>   "40 Days and 40 Nights" skewed female--60%--and played strongest
to viewers ages 17 to 25, said Miramax Films marketing executive
David Kaminow.</TE>
<TE>   "Queen of the Damned," starring late R&amp;B singer Aaliyah as a
6,000-year-old Egyptian vampire bent on ruling the Earth, suffered
the biggest drop in the top 10, losing 61% of its audience from last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" returned to
the top 10 after a two-week absence, jumping two spots to the final
rung with $3.1 million. After 11 weekends, the adventure fantasy has
grossed $287.4 million. The film has 13 Oscar nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10, "Big Fat Liar" and "A Beautiful Mind"
each fell one place to Nos. 7 and 8, with $4.8 million and $4.4
million, respectively. Their totals rose to $38.8 million and $138.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Britney Spears road movie "Crossroads" fell four places, to
No. 9, with $4 million, taking its 17-day total to $31.2
million--about 21/2 times its production budget.</TE>

<HD>Knee-Deep in the Blood, Sweat and Soul of Vietnam</HD>
<DH>More than any other movie of its kind, 'We Were Soldiers'
does justice to the veterans and families on both sides of a
gut-wrenching war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. CACCAVO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In my office hangs an old, yellowed map of French Indochina that once
hung in my apartment in Saigon. Like a school annual, it is inscribed
with signatures of friends from a long-ago war, a rather unusual
school whose requirement for graduation was not to get killed.
Written on the map, on Vietnam, is an "X" with a line drawn out to
the South China Sea and signed with: "It began here, X-Ray, Joe
Galloway." This is where "We Were Soldiers" began for me.</LD>
<LD>   Many years later Joe and Lt. Gen. Hal Moore would write "We Were
Soldiers Once ... and Young" about this place called "X-Ray" where,
in 1965, men of the 1st Battalion of the 7th U.S. Cavalry and even
more young men of the People's Army of Vietnam's 320th, 33rd and 66th
regiments lost their lives in the first major engagement of American
and North Vietnamese military in the Ia Drang Valley.</LD>
<TE>   And this is why the film version of "We Were Soldiers" succeeds
where so many other Vietnam War movies have failed. This story comes
not from a Hollywood filmmaker with a political agenda--many of whom
successfully avoided military service in the war years--but straight
from the souls of the men who were there. America had a quick glimpse
of their quality of character when on Sept. 11, along with
firefighters and police officers, a security man named Rick Rescorla,
whose picture graces the cover of the book, stayed in the World Trade
Center to save lives and lost his own. Rescorla was a veteran of
X-Ray in the Ia Drang.</TE>
<TE>   While Galloway was working on the book, he would call me and other
friends late at night to vent the emotional strain of interviewing
families. This emotion is the source of the film's power. It was
conceived with unconditional love born on the battlefield of the Ia
Drang and carried through the decades by its authors. Now it has
blossomed forth into a powerful film that will change public
perception of the Vietnam veteran.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of those rare occurrences in filmmaking when all
creative efforts are coordinated in a symphonic movement with a
single objective: to honor the men who fought at the Ia Drang. Unlike
"Rambo," "The Deer Hunter," "Coming Home," "Apocalypse Now" and the
circus of other Vietnam fantasy films, "We Were Soldiers" pays
tribute to the dead of our former enemy as well, something that only
those who have been to war can fully appreciate and understand. This
film--suggested viewing for military families who must be prepared
for the unthinkable loss of a husband or father--may very well follow
the path of the book that has become required reading for Army
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Most war movies are action films, but "We Were Soldiers" is as
much a story about women and families as it is about war. Having
grown up as a military dependent, I also related to that portion of
the film. As a youngster I hated moving every few years, but I
wouldn't trade the experience for anything, for we grew up in the
pre-civil rights years free of prejudice as we integrated military
families played and worked together--and, as is expressed in the
film, sometimes cried together when a father didn't come back.</TE>
<TE>   "We Were Soldiers" begins with the French defeat, setting the
stage for a continuing Vietnamese struggle as America vowed that it
would succeed where France had failed. This is critical because most
Americans don't know the complexity of Vietnamese history. If they
did, they wouldn't blame the Vietnam War on our military veterans.
High-ranking officers advised our government not to get involved in a
land war in Indochina, but that advice was ignored by a long line of
American presidents.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other Vietnam War films, "We Were Soldiers" takes no
political stands. This is a story about real people, whose names are
used for the characters portrayed on screen, some of whom are not
alive today to see themselves. I am sure they would be proud, as will
their families ... if they can watch. The battle scenes are as
realistic as any you'll see in a film.</TE>
<TE>   Young PFC Jimmy Nakayama of Rigby, Idaho, was a real person who
was badly burned in an overshot napalm attack. Joe Galloway (played
by Barry Pepper) carried him to a helicopter, only to learn that
Nakayama died two days later, never having seen his daughter, who was
born on the day of the attack. It is a part of the film that Galloway
cannot watch, nor can he or his wife, Karen, watch the scene in which
her father, Capt. Tom Metsker, dies.</TE>
<TE>   The power of "We Were Soldiers" lies in the subtle elements that
veterans will recognize and relate to. Greg Kinnear, who portrays
Maj. Bruce Crandall, goes beyond the call of duty when he lands his
shot-up Huey chopper after numerous runs out to Landing Zone (LZ)
X-Ray; as he stumbles out of his Huey, his knees buckle and he
vomits. That happened to me at a place called Hawk Hill after I got
out of a hot LZ. I was embarrassed until I saw the door gunner do the
same. It's a normal reaction when you have seen your death coming at
you in the form of green tracer bullets banging and slamming into
your chopper.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, "We Were Soldiers" is one of the first Hollywood films to
portray the North Vietnamese as human beings, courageous and
determined and frightened, as devoted to their families as we are. It
is a turning point in the American cinematic interpretation of the
war. In real life, Hal Moore was one of the first American officers
to return to Vietnam after the war to meet his former enemy
counterpart, Nguyen Huu An, who told Moore that his American soldiers
were courageous. It's ironic--and heartbreaking--that after the war
our former enemy treated our veterans with more respect than our
citizens did here at home.</TE>
<TE>   There is a scene in the film in which a diary is taken off the
body of a dead North Vietnamese soldier and given to Moore (Mel
Gibson), who mails it back to the young soldier's widow. In reality,
the diary contained no address or other information and was never
returned.</TE>
<TE>   But I returned such a diary to a former North Vietnamese
lieutenant after I had had it for more than 26 years. I thought I
would be returning it to the family of a dead man, but I was wrong.
When I placed his diary back in his hands in Hanoi in 1996, Hoang Le
Sao wept. I visited him again in his home near the Chinese border in
2000. We have since become friends and now visit together whenever I
go to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the film's final moments, a wounded soldier is being
wheeled by a fellow soldier in an airport corridor. Passing
passengers shrink away from the two men to avoid any contact or
acknowledgment. That coldness from the American public hurt more than
anything the enemy threw at our men in battle.</TE>
<TE>   "We Were Soldiers" is the most finely crafted Vietnam War film to
date and one of the most accurate and moving war films I have seen.
It demonstrates that the courage, compassion and integrity that our
society longs for is in the men we once rejected and ignored and that
our first step toward regaining those lost qualities is to honor
those veterans.</TE>

<HD>A Trilling Performance by L.A. Flute Quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much music out there is written for a quartet of flutes? More
than you would think, and not just a flurry of transcriptions,
either.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night, the Los Angeles Flute Quartet arrived with an
ample amount of new and relatively recent music by California-based
composers, aided in no small way by the spacious, warm acoustics of
the Zipper Concert Hall. The hall made their collective sound bloom,
which was apparent right from the start in the breezy, busy,
neoclassical rhetoric of Ingolf Dahl's "Serenade" (1955), the oldest
work on the program.</LD>
<LD>   There were a couple of newly commissioned pieces for the foursome:
Christopher Caliendo's soaring, sighing, irregularly flowing
"Chovihano: Gypsy Healer," and "A Paul Klee Gallery," a mostly
ruminative six-movement suite by Caliendo's teacher, UCLA's Paul
Reale.</LD>
<TE>   John Thow's tense "Breath of the Sun" tried to evoke the habitat
of the Chumash Indians with a lot of trills and extended techniques
like flutter-tonguing and multiphonics.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Riley's trend-setting epic "In C" has been treated to all
kinds of instrumentations, so why not a flute quartet? With
percussionist Durand Baker establishing the gentle groove, the
ensemble pulled it off handsomely, avoiding monotony with frequent
switching of instruments. The quartet also has a welcome flair for
showmanship, putting some jazz feeling into a fantasy based on Lalo
Schifrin's "Mission: Impossible" themes.</TE>

<HD>Good-Time Groove Spun by Phantom Planet</HD>

<LD>Jason Schwartzman seated himself behind his sparkly red drums on the
Roxy stage on Saturday to the screams of teenage girls. He held a
stick high and, in the best Ringo Starr/Keith Moon tradition,
launched into a punchy rock beat as the other four members of the
band Phantom Planet walked out and strapped on their instruments.</LD>
<LD>   It was pure pop for now people for the next hour. OK, so "now"
sounded more like 1966 or 1979 than 2002, but it was done with
exuberance and lack of calculation.</LD>
<LD>   Arguably, Phantom Planet is Los Angeles' version of the Strokes,
both groups' members coming from privilege and connection.
(Schwartzman and lead singer Alex Greenwald are both actors, the
former having starred in "Rushmore" and the new "Slackers," the
latter in Gap ads and last year's "Donnie Darko.")</LD>
<TE>   But instead of borrowing from New Order and the Smiths, these five
guys worship Elvis Costello and the Kinks, and instead of chips on
their shoulders they have smiles on their faces. While that doesn't
necessarily make them better, it does make them more likable. And the
seams in their rock concoctions don't show as much as in the
Strokes'.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating the release of their second album, "The Guest," the
band Saturday showcased an edgier garage-rock sound than on its
recordings, with three chiming electric guitars compensating for the
absence of keyboards and the other studio embellishments of producers
Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. Such songs as "California" and
"Wishing Well" featured soaring melodies reminiscent of Crowded
House, while "In Our Darkest Hour" sported Ray Davies-esque
introspection.</TE>
<TE>   With a lot of playful bumping and jousting on stage, these guys
clearly love being in this band--and never so much, it seemed, as
when Pete Thomas, of Costello's Attractions, took over the drums to
anchor an enthusiastic encore of Costello's "Pump It Up." With that
done, perhaps Phantom Planet is ready to move beyond hero worship.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>However noble the U.S. campaign against terror, involving the
Pentagon in TV's so-called "reality" shows is a terrible idea, a
dangerous idea, an un-American idea. Yet it's happening.</LD>
<LD>   As this paper has reported, the Pentagon is now granting producers
of these entertainment shows access to its war effort. Why would the
Pentagon do this after imposing such strict limits on news
organizations covering the war in Afghanistan before easing up in
recent weeks?</LD>
<LD>   What better way to erase one of those demarcations essential for
democracy--the line separating state and entertainment content--than
to allow government to influence the course of prime-time series that
are advertised to the public as unfiltered information?</LD>
<TE>   What better way for government to foster self-flattering
images--the ones supporting its policies--than through a venue most
Americans instinctively trust as being free of propaganda?</TE>
<TE>   "There are a variety of ways of providing information to the
American people," a military spokesman told The Times in a recent
story about this convergence of interests. "This is a great way."</TE>
<TE>   From the Pentagon's perspective, is it ever.</TE>
<TE>   There are precedents for this, entertainment and politics having a
long history when it comes to collaborating on public theater. In
past years, Hollywood figures have been summoned east to help
presidents effectively deliver their messages to the public. And
movie directors, from D.W. Griffith to John Huston, have been signed
to make propaganda films that whip up patriotism in wartime.</TE>
<TE>   On TV, moreover, law-enforcement agencies have been glorified for
years by such media ride-along shows as Fox's "Cops," whose
celebratory tone makes them dishonest by definition. The badged
heroes on these shows are pure of heart and mostly mistake free,
servants of the people who bear no resemblance to the bad-cop
minority that makes news headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Partnering the U.S. military with entertainment producers will
also skew reality and potentially mislead viewers.</TE>
<TE>   But get ready. Arriving March 29 is "American Fighter Pilots,"
which profiles fliers and is being updated to include the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks that took place after this CBS series was
initiated.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Pentagon is working with producers of an upcoming
VH1 series featuring the video diaries of military personnel, and
with the future ABC series "Profiles From the Front Line."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon is pre-screening these two, as the Air Force
is "American Fighter Pilots," the producers maintain they will retain
editorial control.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to do something balanced, tell real stories about
Americans and the allies who are out there while we're sitting at
home," Bertram van Munster, a producer for the ABC series, told The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   A nice plan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the presence of a camera inevitably alters reality on some
level, as does the presence of a Pentagon information officer nearby,
standing ready to give assistance and ... advice.</TE>
<TE>   That's hardly the half of it, though. Essential to their survival
is the access these shows must have to stay on the air, as did their
law-enforcement predecessors from "Cops" to the syndicated "LAPD:
Life on the Beat."</TE>
<TE>   That means the Pentagon won't have to censor them. They'll censor
themselves, knowing that if they telecast something negative, or
anything that appears to question Pentagon policy, their umbilical
cords will be severed by a government agency that dislikes being
second-guessed. As all do, whether the White House is Republican or
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   No access, no show.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone connected to these wartime "reality" efforts will
be inclined to go against the government grain in any case. The
producers are not military historians or journalists, after all.
Their interests naturally lie elsewhere. Even those with documentary
experience are essentially entertainers in this instance, their
agenda being solely to put on a good TV show.</TE>
<TE>   The counter-argument: What's to worry? If the series are clearly
labeled for what they are, viewers will see them not as news but as
entertainment, so no problem.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. That would have been the case many decades ago before
the high-tech, multimedia age of what visionary British writer
Malcolm Muggeridge aptly titled "Newzak." What he meant was that we
are bombarded by infinite media of infinite types that together
become too much to sort out and comprehend. As a result, they reach
our brains as the same background hum heard on an elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Although Muggeridge wrote this well before the Internet and CNN
revolutions, it applies also to the present nonstop hum of news
programs, gussied-up information shows and even some entertainment
series whose messages congeal in our minds. Adding to that
disorientation is the latest Internet-influenced gambit of the cable
news channels that has audiences trying to heed anchor lips while
reading headlines from other stories that scroll rapidly across the
bottom of the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The problem in all of this: Processing information and
distinguishing one source from another becomes nearly impossible--if
not immediately, then in the future, when you try recalling what
you've heard and its origin.</TE>
<TE>   As Muggeridge might say, we are knowing more but understanding
less. And adding to this phenomenon, this glut, will be
Pentagon-assisted TV shows keyed to the war effort.</TE>

<LD>Over the last decade, New Line Cinema has reaped a box-office
bonanza--and suffered its share of flops--producing a string of
rap-themed urban films that cost little to make but earn healthy
profits when they click with moviegoers.</LD>
<LD>   The "House Party" movies of the early 1990s were a boon for the
studio. More recently, the urban comedies "Friday" and "Next Friday"
starring rapper Ice Cube have done so well that New Line is releasing
a third sequel--"Friday After Next"--this Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   The studio on Friday will release the latest film from
actor/producer/co-screenwriter Ice Cube. Titled "All About the
Benjamins," the urban action/comedy reunites the rap star with
comedian Mike Epps, who starred with him in "Next Friday."</LD>
<TE>   Directed by Kevin Bray, a veteran of more than 100 music videos,
"All About the Benjamins" tells the story of a bounty hunter who
teams with a small-time con man to take on the dangerous mastermind
behind a deadly diamond heist. ("Benjamins" refers to $100 bills,
which feature the portrait of Benjamin Franklin.)</TE>
<TE>   New Line has such high hopes for the $15-million film that it
bought commercial spots on both the recent Super Bowl telecast on Fox
and last week's Grammy Awards show on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of hope it will cross over," said a New Line spokesman,
"rather than appeal only to the core audience [of rap aficionados]."</TE>

<HD>Symbiosis for 'N Sync and Combs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>'N Sync hits the tour road again this week and along the way will be
joined by opening acts Ginuwine and Sean "P. Diddy" Combs--choices
that might confuse casual fans but come as no surprise to industry
observers who see the singing group looking to tap urban sounds in
their own music.</LD>
<LD>   The 'N Sync tour was scheduled to begin Sunday night in Portland,
Ore., with Ginuwine, the smoky R&amp;B singer, warming up the crowds.
(They'll also team up at Arrowhead Pond on March 11-12.) 'N Sync, who
performed with rapper Nelly at the Grammys, has also picked producers
on recent recordings that veer from their original Swedish pop style
toward a funkier sound. And, as youth pop has cooled off
commercially, the members have been more public about their musical
restlessness.</LD>
<LD>   "I think 'N Sync is making an attempt to cross over to the R&amp;B
audience ... the lines are getting a little blurred between the
sounds," says Erik Parker, senior editor for the Source magazine. "It
makes sense for them, too. After you max out on your [youth] pop
career, where else do you go?"</LD>
<TE>   The most intriguing aspect of the tour may be P. Diddy, who joins
the tour later on dates that have yet to be firmed up. The music
mogul has seen his Bad Boy Entertainment empire, as well as his own
album sales, sag in recent years. Sidekick act is an unusual role for
a headliner name in hip-hop, but Parker says Combs sees an
opportunity with 'N Sync. "He doesn't risk credibility [in hip-hop
circles] because he's not what you would call street.... He's still a
pop music icon even if he's not having the success he had before. And
by playing with 'N Sync, he will see more people than he would on his
own. Puffy and 'N Sync are both looking for crossover, but what's
weird is I think in the end 'N Sync is using Puffy more than Puffy is
using 'N Sync."</TE>

<HD>What Was His Line? Funny</HD>
<DH>Radio* Fred Allen, who wasn't able to transfer his success
to TV, nevertheless influenced the comic styles of many. Proof of his
staying power: a sold-out Paley tribute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"California is a fine place to live--if you happen to be an orange."</LD>
<LD>   --Fred Allen</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The first three evenings to sell out at the Museum of Television &amp;
Radio's 19th Annual William S. Paley Festival were no
surprise--"Alias," "Six Feet Under" and "Queer as Folk." All three
are hip, cutting-edge series that appeal to the 18-to-49 demographic
that networks cater to and advertisers covet.</TE>
<TE>   That certainly can't be said of Fred Allen, the fourth sellout in
the two-week festival.</TE>
<TE>   Allen is best known for the radio work he did before 1950, most
notably the popular sketch comedy show "The Fred Allen Show," which
ran on the NBC radio network from 1942-49. He never made a
comfortable transition to television and died 46 years ago at the age
of 61.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Allen influenced such radio and television comics as
Garrison Keillor, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and David Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   "We are saluting Fred Allen because of his influence on American
comedy both on radio and television and in general," says Ron Simon,
who is curating the event. A similar Allen retrospective in November
at the New York City branch of the museum was equally popular.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a wide range of people who in some way Fred Allen
influenced, from historian Arthur Schlesinger to Kurt Vonnegut to
comedian Alan King," Simon says.</TE>
<TE>   The Paley festival has an eclectic panel for the Wednesday night
event at the Directors Guild of America Theater. Among those
participating are Dick Cavett, radio writer-producer-director Norman
Corwin, writer Larry Gelbart, writer-cartoonist Stuart Hample, writer
Hal Kanter, producer-writer Normal Lear, comedian-director Dick
Martin and novelist Herman Wouk of "The Winds of War" fame, who wrote
for Allen in the late '30s.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that Fred Allen did was give a topicality to
American humor," says Simon. "Allen was known for reading many, many
papers a day. He really wanted to comment on current events. Most of
the other comedians on radio were relying on old vaudeville sketches
or sketches that worked well on the live stage."</TE>
<TE>   And there was Allen's style. "Allen didn't really play a
character," says Simon. "He was Fred Allen, the great wit commenting
upon current events of the time. He didn't develop an alter ego like
Jack Benny did or Bob Hope did or obviously Edgar Bergen. So it was
just Allen almost versus the world."</TE>
<TE>   Born John Florence Sullivan on May 31, 1894, in Cambridge, Mass.,
Allen spent most of his childhood living with an aunt. His mother
died when he was 3, and his father was a hard-drinking bookbinder.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred was at heart a humorist and a writer, but didn't know it,"
says Hample. "He didn't go to college. He went to something called
Commerce High School in Boston for children of blue-collar workers.
He was left to his own devices."</TE>
<TE>   Hample tells the story of Allen's caustic quick wit even in
school, as he once told a teacher during math class: "Let X equal my
father's signature."</TE>
<TE>   Allen taught himself how to juggle and by 18 was appearing as a
juggler and comedian in vaudeville. He played the Palace Theatre in
New York City 1919 and then appeared in numerous Broadway shows,
including "The Passing Show of 1922," where he met his future wife,
Portland Hoffa, who would be his version of Gracie Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Allen started in radio in 1932 on "The Linit Bath Club Revue." By
the time he was doing "The Fred Allen Show" in the '40s, he'd
developed a weekly sketch dubbed "Allen's Alley," in which Allen
would knock on the doors of various comedic characters including Mrs.
Nussbaum, a Jewish housewife, and the Southern Sen. Claghorn.</TE>
<TE>   Allen also got a lot of mileage out of his "feud" with Jack Benny,
which began in the late 1930s over Benny's ability to play the
violin.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gelbart ("MASH," "Tootsie"), a longtime fan of Allen's, came
across his path twice when he was a young writer. "I met him in 1946
in New York," he recalls. "I was one of the writers on 'Duffy's
Tavern,' and the show traveled to New York to do a couple of weeks
there. Fred Allen was a guest on one of the shows. I wrote some
material for him as one did for a guest artist." Two years later,
Gelbart encountered him at the William Morris office in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "To a young writer, it was like a rodeo clown meeting John Wayne,"
says Gelbart. "He was a wit. Those were the days when you didn't have
to be sunny to be liked. You could be iconoclastic. You could be
ironic. You could be sarcastic. He was all of the above and more."</TE>
<TE>   But Allen's humor also got him in trouble with the censors.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I met him in New York, we were in a room reading
the script that we were going to do and the NBC censors came into the
room," says Gelbart. "He physically changed. He was very disturbed by
their presence because he had running fights with them."</TE>
<TE>   "He had high blood pressure," says Hample, author of the new book
"all the sincerity in hollywood: Selections from the Writings of
Radio's Legendary Comedian Fred Allen. "He was a terribly hard
worker. He wrote all the time, and while he did have writers in his
career, he rewrote everything. He was a perfectionist. Everything had
to bear his stamp."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By 1947, Allen was No. 1 on the radio and made the cover of Time
magazine. But in 1949, he found his audience turning the dial to the
game show "Stop the Music."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't give up without a fight, even parodying the game show on
his series. But the "Music" juggernaut was unstoppable. "He wore
himself out," says Hample. "His sponsors, Ford, pulled out and he
pulled out of the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who resembled a saggy, baggy bloodhound, once admitted, "he
had a face for radio." And he didn't take much stock in television:
"Television is a device that permits people who haven't anything to
do to watch people who can't do anything."</TE>
<TE>   He tried a TV quiz show. "It wasn't very good," says Hample. "That
was beneath him," adds Gelbart. "Fred Allen doing a game show would
be like Winston Churchill judging a beauty contest."</TE>
<TE>   Allen ended up as a panelist on CBS' "What's My Line" for the last
two years of his life.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's celebration of Allen will feature excerpts from his
radio routines as well as clips from such TV appearances as an early
"Colgate Comedy Hour" with Jackie Gleason. "We also have an 'Omnibus'
[CBS' cultural series] where he is reading an excerpt from his book,
'Treadmill to Oblivion,'" says Simon. "The point of the seminar is
that we are going to slow that treadmill down for Fred Allen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Salute to Fred Allen" takes place Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the
Directors Guild of America Theater, 7920 Sunset Blvd. The event is
sold out.</TE>

<HD>Moldy Peaches Ripen on Stage</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They've garnered almost as much buzz as fellow New Yorkers and recent
tour mates the Strokes, but the Moldy Peaches have more in common
with the kids from South Park than the aforementioned retro-rock
pinups.</LD>
<LD>   While the group's wonderfully wacky show at the Knitting Factory
on Friday offered its share of riff-packed raucousness and
slacker-style artiness, its subversive humor outshone everything
else, and that's obviously the point.</LD>
<LD>   The Peaches, led by singer-songwriter duo Kimya Dawson and Adam
Green, may not take themselves too seriously (they're known for
outrageous costumes; this show featured Dawson in a clownish hippie
get-up and Green in a relatively demure rhinestone-studded pair of
girl's jeans). But their combination of childish sing-along-style
ditties about sex and drugs, and noisy punk anthems about cartoons
and adolescent crushes, is more irony than quirky shtick.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the New York "anti-folk" scene, the Peaches' unplugged
simplicity was joyously captured, flaws and all, on their self-titled
Rough Trade debut album last year. The pair use a full band live, an
addition that takes away intimacy from a couple of tunes but never
detracts from their biting wit. More aggressive tunes such as "NYC's
Like a Graveyard" and "D2 Boyfriend" gained an extra layer of power
and rhythm that brought to mind Beck's groove-y melodies and Sonic
Youth's eclectic assaults.</TE>
<TE>   Smartly, they stayed true to low-key compositions such as "Jorge
Regula" and "What Went Wrong," Dawson's painful portrayal of
unrequited teen love.</TE>
<TE>   It was with these more emotive cuts that the Peaches showed some
range. Still, with the audience seeming to prefer lyrically depraved
numbers such as "Who's Got the Crack," it may be hard for the band to
ever be seen as more than a novelty act.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If those ruffled feathers protruding from David Letterman, Ted
Koppel, Barbara Walters and Regis Philbin are any indication, the
relationship between today's studio-owned television networks and
their stars is clearly changing.</LD>
<LD>   ABC's pursuit of Letterman to move his late-night talk show to
that network from CBS--news that came as a surprise to longtime
"Nightline" host Ted Koppel, who, if a deal is reached, would be
displaced--is only the latest maneuver underscoring that today's
media companies will do what they deem best for their bottom lines,
an approach that leaves little room for sacred cows.</LD>
<LD>   That includes Koppel, who may have misread his corporate bosses at
the Walt Disney Co. by trimming his commitment to the 22-year-old
late-night franchise to three nights a week, and Letterman, whose
camp has accused CBS of arrogance in its negotiations with the host.</LD>
<TE>   Insiders at CBS dispute that characterization, suggesting that
Letterman may be one of those stars who feels trifled with, in
essence, no matter how much money and praise the network lavishes
upon him. As it stands, the parties privately present different
versions of events, such as whether one of Letterman's demands was
control over what fills the hour his show currently occupies for
several years once he gives up hosting it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the facts or resolution of this latest late-night tremor
(the decision ultimately rests with Letterman, who is on vacation
this week), it seems clear that networks are taking a harder line in
their dealings with high-profile talent.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the six stars of "Friends" and "Frasier's" Kelsey Grammer
have each received $1-million-per-episode deals, demonstrating that
the bank is still open for proven hits.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Disney, CBS parent Viacom, AOL Time
Warner and Fox parent News Corp.--huge companies that derive revenue
from a wide assortment of sources--have demonstrated that the
contributions of talent are currently measured not in terms of
rewarding past service but on a "What have you done for me lately?"
basis.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, in particular, has repeatedly made clear the network will
take whatever actions are deemed necessary and endure the
consequences. In just the last few months, that included temporarily
yanking "20/20" from the Friday slot, where Walters reigned for a
dozen years, in a failed attempt to showcase "Once and Again," a
Disney-produced drama; and casting doubt on the future of "Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire," irking host Philbin, whose popular morning show
is also produced by Disney.</TE>
<TE>   In similar fashion, Fox has struck a series of deals in which the
studio sold programs to its FX cable network that left talent feeling
shortchanged of a fair share of profits, leading to lawsuits filed by
"MASH's" Alan Alda and Larry Gelbart, "NYPD Blue" co-creator Steven
Bochco (the studio distributes reruns of the program) and "The
X-Files" star David Duchovny.</TE>
<TE>   The sense that the major studios/networks--made larger by
deregulation that fueled a series of major mergers in the 1990s--are
willing to bulldoze talent fed the fear of strikes last year by the
guilds representing writers and actors, and although new
eleventh-hour agreements were reached, it remains a burning source of
concern within that community.</TE>
<TE>   The Writers Guild of America, in fact, recently urged the
government to hold hearings examining the effects of deregulating the
entertainment industry. At the guild's annual awards dinner Saturday,
WGA West President Victoria Riskin summed up what is perceived to be
at stake, citing "the shrinking number of employers [and] the
pressure to serve commerce ever more and art, rarely."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the challenges facing most rank-and-file actors,
writers or news correspondents don't necessarily apply to marquee
names such as Letterman, Koppel or Philbin. In fact, a two-tiered
system has gradually come into existence under which the salaries
paid to top stars ballooned while networks and studios held to a hard
line vis-a-vis lower-profile employees.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if media giants become increasingly willing to risk the
wrath of their biggest stars--whose size may be reduced only because
they are swimming in a much larger pond--one can argue that that
bodes even worse for those lower on the talent food chain.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help, in this particular case, that Letterman and
Koppel are known to be especially prickly. Koppel has criticized all
the broadcast networks for a reduced commitment to news and has
confronted Disney Chairman Michael Eisner about sparing ABC News from
layoffs, citing staff members who lost their lives while serving the
network.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman, for his part, has bristled at a lack of support from
CBS but doesn't always embrace "synergy" as willingly as his
principal rival, "The Tonight Show's" Jay Leno. So while Leno ties in
with network promotional opportunities such as his recent
Olympic-themed shows, Letterman balks at some synergistic
arrangements--treating guests from the network's prime-time hit
"Survivor," for example, as if their appearances were a nuisance,
having the ousted contestants stand awkwardly in the wings rather
than sit next to him.</TE>
<TE>   As powerful as consolidated media companies are, they do remain
vulnerable in such disputes, at least in the war of public relations
and perception. After the slight to Walters, her cohorts on ABC's
daytime show "The View" criticized the network. On his morning
program, meanwhile, Philbin--quoting a character from "The Godfather,
Part II," describing life in organized crime--said that indignities
while dealing with network executives were, in essence, part of the
business he had chosen.</TE>
<TE>   The networks may hold the purse strings, but stars, after all,
still command the spotlight.</TE>

<HD>Did 'Lobby Hero' Critic Have an Agenda?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY PATCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jan Breslauer is a friend of mine. She can write. As a Times feature
writer, sometime critic, theater professor and now producing director
of the Falcon Theatre, she knows theater's do's and don'ts. Which is
why I found her mean-spirited review of Kenneth Lonergan's "Lobby
Hero" (Calendar, Feb. 25), now playing at South Coast Repertory, so
baffling.</LD>
<LD>   This is not about a negative notice. Over 38 seasons and 371
opening nights, SCR has collected its share. But Times critics from
Cecil Smith to Michael Phillips respected the time and talents of the
artists involved in the shows they panned, just as the artists and
people on the producing side respected the critics' right to their
(negative) opinions.</LD>
<LD>   This is the most vicious review SCR has ever received: an
unmitigated attack on the playwright, director and cast, and on SCR's
motives for producing the play. For example:</LD>
<TE>   Breslauer uses four paragraphs to defame "This Is Our Youth," an
earlier Lonergan hit that ran off-Broadway for a year. Her proof for
its flaws is that it has yet to have an L.A. production. As a
producing director, she should know this has more to do with Lonergan
and his agent getting the right offer than any lack of interest in
the play. She says it's "easily castable"--as if Mark Ruffalos grew
on trees. Lonergan's protagonists are uncommon and complex and
require uncommon actors.</TE>
<TE>   Breslauer calls those who embraced "This Is Our Youth" "the
intelligentsia" and "limousine liberals," while the playwright
himself is "chichi," "hot" and an "it" boy.</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan is an original who puts the moral quandaries and crises
of conscience, normally given in plays to the privileged, into the
lives of contemporary young commoners. The indifference of his
slackers is a cover for characters who are overpowered by
circumstance and yearn for values that are timeless.</TE>
<TE>   But we get none of this from Breslauer, who is fixed on turning
lines in a self-conscious, too-hip style: The play is a
"drone-on-athon" or "verbal lard." She's so busy minting zingers that
she neglects to listen to a story about lonely nighthawks resolutely
filling silences. Nor does she report its concerns to her
readers--which was her job.</TE>
<TE>   What coin is there to be mined by sliming Lonergan? More of this
anon.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there's plenty of slime for all. For Kevin Corrigan, who
is advised to stick to film, and T.E. Russell, who is not
"surprising." Russell plays William, the righteous oak that won't
bend; his corruption is the play's constant--no surprise there, nor
should there be.</TE>
<TE>   Corrigan is a proven film talent in his first stage lead, a
brilliant intuitive actor playing the title anti-hero in a unique,
understated way. Audiences listen to him, even if Breslauer didn't.
More fortunate were Simon Billig, dismissed as "usually better," and
Tessa Auberjonois, forgotten after being mentioned as present.</TE>
<TE>   Breslauer positively savages director Olivia Honegger, a bright
young woman in her first big assignment after years of prepping for
it. Her production, praised elsewhere, speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   The reviewer is entitled to her negative opinion of Honegger's
work. What Honegger doesn't deserve is needless snide trashing:
"seems to have cut class on Directing 101." Again, why so vicious?</TE>
<TE>   Breslauer begins her review by impugning SCR for producing a play
by a "hot" writer, the implication being we jumped on his bandwagon.
SCR had championed and developed "Lobby Hero" in a public reading in
January 1999, before Lonergan went platinum. The play had been
promised elsewhere, so SCR waited and scheduled it when it became
available.</TE>
<TE>   Breslauer's kind of vituperative review does the theater no good.
It makes actors working in film and television wary of returning to
the stage. It bolsters the arguments of their agents to refuse a
relatively low-paying, high-risk commitment that takes them away from
more lucrative media markets. It encourages writers such as Lonergan
to forsake the art form that trained him for the one that now
lionizes him and will make him wealthy--film.</TE>
<TE>   When we heard from The Times that Jan would be reviewing "Lobby
Hero," it gave us pause not only because she is the producing
director of another Southern California theater but also because, in
late spring 2000, she visited me at SCR to discuss the possibility of
working here. How small-minded of us, we decided. Now, of course,
we're having second thoughts. And perhaps Breslauer, given those
associations and the vehement nature of her response to "Lobby Hero,"
simply should have recused herself.</TE>
<TE>   But why was her notice so mean-spirited?</TE>
<TE>   Breslauer returns to reviewing with this notice. Trying to pants
the new Emperor, Kenneth Lonergan, certainly got everyone's
attention. Whether or not that pulled Lonergan down, it can give the
illusion of elevating Breslauer to his equal.</TE>
<TE>   Former Herald-Examiner critic Jack Viertel was recruited by
Broadway's Jujamcyn after attacking its praised production of "Big
River." Frank Rich and Alex Witchel gained spotlights in the New York
Times by ripping Broadway icons. It's a gambit that works.</TE>
<TE>   Did Breslauer serve herself more than the theater with her "Lobby
Hero" review? We'll see.</TE>
<TE>   Editor's Note: The Times was aware of Breslauer's position at the
Falcon Theatre and should have identified her as such in her review
of "Lobby Hero."</TE>

<DH>Bill T. Jones and his company shake up ideas as they ponder
movement's connection to music.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As contemporary choreographers reexamine the bedrock relationship
between music and dance, a kind of coincidental festival of their
findings has taken place on local stages.</LD>
<LD>   Featuring the Orion String Quartet and members of the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center, weekend performances at UCLA by the
Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company explored such issues as how to
make musicians more than mere accompanists and how to make fresh,
personal dances from the masterworks of the Western classical
tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Like the new choreography by postmodern pioneer Trisha Brown (also
recently seen on the Westwood campus) and the collaboration between
cellist Walter Haman and modern dancer Jose Navas at the Skirball
Cultural Center last week, Jones' Royce Hall programs on Friday and
Saturday represented an adventure in collaboration.</LD>
<TE>   In this context, his oldest piece, "D-Man in the Waters" from 1989
(revised nine years later), lost its original moorings as a tribute
to a fallen colleague and became instead a reminder of the wedding of
breezy athleticism and classical music that Paul Taylor shaped into a
modern dance subgenre.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing Mendelssohn's Op. 20 Octet for a celebration of youth,
energy and togetherness, "D-Man" began with magically
dissolving/re-forming clusters of dancers, motifs such as upturned
hands shimmering in front of faces and genial defiance of gender
norms: Leah Cox and Ayo Janeen Jackson as female cavaliers supporting
and turning hunky Denis Boroditski, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, however, the images of dancers bearing lifeless
comrades (Jackson, in particular) and of Wen-Chung Lin emerging as a
symbol of transcendence anchored the dancers' soaring prowess in
references to the AIDS crisis. But in musicality, the piece never
strayed from conventional sight-sound synchronization. However
unorthodox the movement, it reinforced Mendelssohn diligently, phrase
by phrase.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the untitled solo that company dancer Eric Bradley
choreographed and danced to a Ravel quartet intuitively reflected the
contours of the score through a flurry of dodgy, darting steps and,
especially, his imaginative, flyaway arm motion.</TE>
<TE>   Other approaches, however, dominated Jones' three West Coast
premieres. In musicality, "Verbum" represented a declaration of
independence, running alongside one of Beethoven's late quartets (Op.
135), but very post-Cunningham in its separate-and-equal stance. Only
in a mercurial solo (danced by Toshiko Oiwa on Friday, Malcolm Low on
Saturday) did sustained points of contact occur; otherwise the piece
emphasized stage design: silvery, sleeveless Liz Prince body suits
framed in Bjorn Amelan's door-like sculpture units.</TE>
<TE>   Prime postmodern playoffs fueled the choreography. Sometimes the
dancers strolled nonchalantly; elsewhere they executed complex
technical feats. Some passages offered an overload of gestural games;
others displayed the cast's mastery of convulsive torso shakes. If
you wanted liberation from the rules of dance-making, you found it in
this company showpiece--a work every bit as arbitrary, impulsive and
unpredictable as you could imagine but danced with spectacular
assurance.</TE>
<TE>   Along with confirming Jones' eclecticism, "Black Suzanne" used the
Shostakovich Op. 11 Prelude and Scherzo to support a quasi-dramatic
action-plan: gladiatorial combat between Jackson and Oiwa. Each stood
high above the floor, balanced atop other dancers as if on moving
platforms or chariots.</TE>
<TE>   Amelan's giant smirking, eight-petaled flower served as backdrop,
but the red Prince costumes and red floor mats reinforced the sense
of warriors-in-training: lots of stomping, staggering and collapsing,
displays of brute force (Jackson lifting Boroditski on her back),
with the music serving as a generalized soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, Jones' "WorldWithout/In" utterly distanced itself
from its music--two pieces by contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy
Kurtag--but placed four musicians from Chamber Music Society Two
onstage as both performers and onlookers in a nightmarish ritual of
death, resurrection and transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Danced against the score and sometimes in long stretches of
silence, the piece deployed a number of bizarre characters on and
under a towering pyramid designed by Amelan. Daniel Russell Kubert,
for instance, played a self-flagellating ninja watched by a greedy
gnome played by Asli Bulbul and eventually united with him in a
floral people-tower.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones resolutely avoided linear dramaturgy, so the
neo-Expressionist result sent as many ticket holders fleeing into the
night as giving it a standing ovation. Two weeks past his 50th
birthday, he continues to challenge and provoke, take risks and
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the dancers previously listed, the company included
Germaul Yusef Barnes and Catherine Cabeen. The Orion musicians were
Daniel Phillips, Todd Phillips, Steven Tenenbom and Timothy Eddy.
Chamber Music Society Two enlisted Timothy Fain, Ruggero
Allifranchini, Hsin-Yun Huang and Sophie Shao.</TE>

<HD>Raffish Satire Revived in 'Beggar's Holiday'</HD>
<DH>Fun percolates through a concert reading of Duke
Ellington's only Broadway musical, presented by the Rubicon Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Ellington wrote only one full score for a Broadway musical:
"Beggar's Holiday." But after its 1946 premiere, chances to see it
have been as rare as holidays for beggars.</LD>
<LD>   That's probably reason enough for Ellington fans and for followers
of the permutations of the original source material, John Gay's "The
Beggar's Opera," to venture to the Laurel Theatre in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Rubicon Theatre Company is presenting 11 semi-staged performances
of a new version of the show, featuring a rewrite of John Latouche's
book and lyrics by "Man of La Mancha" librettist Dale Wasserman, who
worked on the original "Beggar's Holiday" as a young assistant
producer.</LD>
<TE>   Directed by James O'Neil, the actors carry scripts in what is
billed as "a concert reading." But they also move around the stage
and engage in bare-bones choreography. A narrator (Jim Alexander)
reads the stage directions. The set and lighting have been adapted
from the last occupant of the stage, "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris." The uncredited costumes are hardly lavish but
are more character-specific than mere street clothes.</TE>
<TE>   A backstage band has only three players--musical director Kevin
Toney on keyboards, bass player Ida Bodin and drummer Tony Lewis--but
it treats Ellington's lush and varied score with care.</TE>
<TE>   The score begins with a soulful meditation on ambivalence, "In
Between," sung by a contemporary Beggar (Carl Anderson). Then he
takes us into his own imaginary world, in which he plays the gangster
MacHeath in a city in the American South.</TE>
<TE>   The story's ingredients are similar to those of the 1728 original
and its most famous variant, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The
Threepenny Opera." MacHeath is secretly married to young Polly
Peachum (Sara Mann), while playing around with the madam Miss Jenny
(Alaina Reed Hall). Polly's disreputable parents (Paul Ainsley and
Sharon McNight) and Jenny all plot to turn over MacHeath to the
police captain (Louis Tucker), but the captain's daughter, Lucy
Lockit (Cheryl Carter), falls for the imprisoned MacHeath and
facilitates his temporary escape.</TE>
<TE>   The 1946 original had such problems in the second act that the
final 20 minutes "were virtually improvised" on opening night,
director John Houseman recalled in his memoir. The current version
also has an extremely unfinished quality. The concluding plot
developments are rushed through and barely staged at all. The upbeat
grand finale of both acts, "Tomorrow Mountain," hardly seems
justified by the story. Anderson's performance is much more tentative
in the second act.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a spirit of raffish satire remains alive and well. Neophyte
criminal Sneaky Pete (Danny Bolero) tells us why "I Wanna Be Bad"
with flair. The Peachums and their favorite cop compare life to a
particularly vicious football game in "The Scrimmage of Life."
Lawyers take it on the chin, in 3/4 time, in "Tooth and Claw." Miss
Jenny scornfully mocks MacHeath's suggestion that they sire a son in
"Lullaby for Junior."</TE>
<TE>   Although not especially topical, the script includes several
obviously recent references. The blind beggar says the government
considers him "optically challenged."</TE>
<TE>   A few of the less satiric songs are easily detachable for use
outside the show, such as the smoothly jazzy "Take Love Easy" and the
introspective "Brown Penny."</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping that "Beggar's Holiday" returns in a properly
finished form.</TE>

<HD>Getty's 18th Century Scenes Fail to Come to Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 17th and 18th centuries, travelers paraded and traipsed
through Italy, a grand tour destination meant to bring them into
contact with antiquity. The contact could be spiritual or
intellectual, but it also could be physical. Collectors gripped
tightly onto ancient Greek and Roman artifacts and brought them home.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition "Italy on the Grand Tour," at the Getty Center,
highlights what these grand tourists--especially the grandest ones,
the British--saw and how they saw it. It is the how that interests
us. And in the case of the most notable collector, William Hamilton,
the British ambassador to Naples in the second half of the 18th
century, it is also the who. Hamilton's collection formed the basis
for the British Museum.</LD>
<LD>   His second wife, Emma, went down in history for her Neapolitan
salons, her theatrical and often erotic poses as the figures on Greek
vases and her love affair with Adm. Horatio Nelson. Vivien Leigh
famously played Emma in Churchill's favorite film, "That Lady
Hamilton." Susan Sontag's novel "The Volcano Lover" is a Postmodern
pursuit of William and Emma.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly this is a couple, along with Hamilton's first wife,
Catherine--whose harpsichord playing was admired by Mozart--made for
the stage. And that is where they wound up Saturday night in the
Getty's Harold M. Williams Auditorium in a multimedia presentation of
tableaux vivants enhanced by dance, music and narration. But the main
impetus  of director Michael Hackett in his show, "Living Pictures:
The Neapolitan Salons of Sir William Hamilton and the Two Lady
Hamiltons," was Emma's "attitudinizing."</TE>
<TE>   Some spectators found Emma's  classical Greek posturing
ridiculous, especially once plump Emma became fat Emma.  For others,
her see-through drapery was the attraction. But some  were profoundly
moved,  finding in her an artistry that captured the spiritual
essence of an antique world.</TE>
<TE>   To explore how that might have happened is an intriguing project
and the stated goal of the Getty's multimedia stew, which had several
cooks. Emma Lewis Thomas re-created historic dances. Archlutinist
Michael Eagan, the music director of Musica Angelica, reproduced
music played in the Hamilton salons with members of his period
instrument ensemble. Leon Weibers designed historical costumes.
Students from UCLA danced, acted and attitudinized. Narration was
prerecorded by actors, including Donald Sinden. One of the
exhibition's curators, Allegra Pesenti, was a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nothing quite contradicts the spirit and temperament of the
grand tourists more than submissively reliving the past. Musicians
sat at the back of the stage, where their sounds were acoustically
dead, playing dutiful performances of composers who might have come
through Hamilton's Neapolitan household and others whom Catherine
liked to play. Fourteen-year-old Mozart and his father rushed on
stage at the start of an early sonata for two violins and bass and
then froze. There were antique dances to Francesco Durante and
Handel. Rachel Avery attempted Emma's attitudinizing. Slides were
projected.</TE>
<TE>   Bland music by Williams' music teacher, Felice Giardani,
accompanied scenes from daily life. A copy of Giardini's Violin
Sonata, Opus 7, No. 1, which was inscribed to William Hamilton, was
found at UCLA, and so it was performed. Daniel Plaster appeared as
Michael Kelly, a tenor who appeared at the salons, singing three
arias in studied demeanor. The recordings of actors reciting
Hamilton, Goethe, Mozart and others, which introduced the tableaux,
were broadcast at twice the volume of song or the string instruments.
Eagen's large archlute was more easily seen than heard.</TE>
<TE>   In all of this, there was little of life then or now. Young
performers were idealized figures. The recorded narration, crudely
amplified (the Getty's billions seem to have run out by the time it
came to installing a sound system in the theater),  as opposed to
actors present on stage, bespoke the irresistible urge to appropriate
modern technology. However, in contrast to the amplification, music,
remaining acoustically "pure," sounded prissy, flat, far away.</TE>
<TE>   In a question-and-answer session with the audience, Hackett had
interesting things to say about how Emma's poses found their way into
theater through the ages, which is something worth exploration. Emma,
as seen through the modern era, from celluloid Leigh to Sontag's "fat
lady," could be an equally intriguing project.  UCLA has just
purchased Sontag's papers; perhaps those will provide just the kind
of source material needed to take another, richer look at this
fascinating subject.</TE>

<HD>'Biography' Marks 15th Anniversary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Biography is a very definite region bounded on the north by history,
on the south by fiction, on the east by obituary and on the west by
tedium," British biographer Philip Guedalla once told the London
Observer. Though it's been 73 years and one day since the publication
of that quote, the same could be said of A&amp;E's "Biography."</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 8, the series will mark its 15th anniversary with a
two-hour retrospective that gets off to a strong start but gradually
loses some steam.</LD>
<LD>   The show begins with the story of "Biography's" own early years,
when Peter Graves was host and it struggled to find an identity in
the new world of cable TV. By 1994, the series had expanded from one
to five nights a week and added Jack Perkins as host. It has since
become a cottage industry that has spawned the Biography Channel, a
magazine, a Web site, books, videos and a board game. And its fair
share of parodies, a few of which are shown tonight.</LD>
<TE>   "Being spoofed on 'Saturday Night Live' is the ultimate, ultimate
cultural compliment," says Harry Smith, the series' current host.</TE>
<TE>   The first third of the special also concentrates on interviews
with the series' producers, who offer a number of funny and
fascinating behind-the-scenes tidbits.</TE>
<TE>   After that, though, the focus shifts. And slowly, one of
"Biography's" strengths--diversity--becomes a bit of a weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the show has profiled more than 900 people,
ranging from Attila the Hun to Frank Zappa. Tonight's program covers
quite a few of them, grouped into themes both relatively innocuous
(child stars and celebrities before they were famous) and sinister
(career crashes and criminals).</TE>
<TE>   But, after more than an hour, this quick-hit approach can become
wearying. Indeed, by the show's end, some viewers might find their
interest heading south. Or, in Guedalla's words, heading west.</TE>

<HD>Starz Encore Climbs Into Movie Ring</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starz Encore executives say this weekend's premiere of "Joe and Max,"
about boxers Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, is more than just a special
offering on the pay-cable service. The film marks the entrance of the
network into the original cable movie arena currently dominated by
HBO and Showtime.</LD>
<LD>   Starz Encore, like those networks, shows theatrical movies with no
commercials but has offered little original fare. Paige Orloff, vice
president of original movies for Starz Encore, said that Starz will
be selective in its development. "We're not looking for volume. We're
not going to make a bunch of $3-million movies, so we won't have the
output of HBO or Showtime. We're spending about $5 million to $8
million a movie, so we can tell filmmakers and the creative community
we are interested in quality, not quantity."</LD>
<LD>   Orloff added that "Joe and Max," which details the rivalry and
ultimate friendship between the two boxers, is indicative of the
kinds of movies Starz Encore is developing: "We want to develop a
distinctive brand. We want to tell stories that have a cultural
resonance," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The movie, which premieres Saturday at 8 p.m., stars Leonard
Roberts as Louis and German star Til Schweiger as Max, and also
features Richard Roundtree, Peta Wilson and David Paymer.</TE>
<TE>   Starz Encore is not the only cable network diving into the
original movie business. On Sunday, ESPN will air its first original
movie, "A Season on the Brink," about controversial basketball coach
Bob Knight.</TE>

<LD>On top of my computer sits a desiccated piranha displaying a mouthful
of razor-sharp teeth. Why is that fish there? To remind me of that
wonderful trip to Venezuela? To signal I'm not to be messed with?
Maybe it's there because I'm a creative, unconventional individual
who refuses to be fettered by the stifling dictates of corporate
office culture. Or maybe I want people to think I'm a creative,
unconventional individual who refuses to be fettered by the stifling
dictates of corporate office culture.</LD>
<LD>   If one little dried-out fish can potentially carry that much
information, just think how much could be gleaned from a roomful of
possessions. And we are constantly trying to glean. Which of us,
visiting a home, hasn't nosed furtively through a CD collection or
bookshelf to try and get some measure of our host's personality--and
balked, perhaps, at that Barry Manilow boxed set or the big stack of
"Passion for Knives" magazines?</LD>
<LD>   "It's a basic human need to want to know what people are like, for
all kinds of reasons: Can we trust them? Are they a potential mate?"
says Samuel Gosling, assistant professor of psychology at the
University of Texas in Austin. "So, when we're in places where
information is rich, we make use of it."</LD>
<TE>   Not everything we deduce will be accurate, of course. People may
display misleading messages. Someone who's ruthlessly ambitious might
adorn his or her office with cloying inspirational posters applauding
teamwork. A conservative college kid may flaunt CDs of hip,
nihilistic rock stars to appear cool.</TE>
<TE>   Observers, what's more, may extrapolate erroneously from what they
see. The fact that I have a teetering, 2-foot-high in-tray doesn't
necessarily mean I'm scatterbrained and undependable. And only the
shadow knows what my co-worker with the welcoming basket of candy and
smiley-face pencil is really thinking.</TE>
<TE>   To find out how much people deduce from someone's "social
environment"--and whether those deductions are accurate--Gosling and
his colleagues enrolled 83 current and former students and 94 office
workers in a study. All agreed to have either their bedrooms (in the
students' case) or offices assessed by 7 or 8 observers.</TE>
<TE>   Participants were told not to alter anything. And even if they did
rush around picking up sweaty socks, "there's a big difference
between a tidied room and one that's deeply tidy," Gosling says.
"There's only so much you can do in a short time to alphabetize the
books and CDs, color-code the stationery, sharpen all your pencils
and line them up--things that deeply tidy people do."</TE>
<TE>   Each assessor then scored the occupant on a scale of 1-7 for five
broad personality traits (known, by psychologists, as the "Big
Five"):</TE>
<TE>   * openness to new experiences;</TE>
<TE>   * agreeableness;</TE>
<TE>   * extroversion;</TE>
<TE>   * emotional stability, a measure of how calm, relaxed and
self-assured someone is;</TE>
<TE>   * conscientiousness, an indication not of morality but
dependability (whether people are apt to show up for meetings and pay
their parking tickets on time).</TE>
<TE>   To test the assessments' accuracy, Gosling and colleagues compared
raters' assessments to ones done by occupants and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Raters gleaned a lot in just a few minutes, Gosling says. (The
study, "A Room With a Cue," is published in the latest issue of the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.) They weren't great at
accurately assessing agreeableness and extroversion, but they were
surprisingly adept at scoring someone's dependability and openness to
new experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Now Gosling and colleagues plan to analyze the phenomenon in more
detail. They have huge inventories of room contents--all those
pebbles from beaches, unwashed coffee mugs, postcards declaring "you
don't have to be crazy to work here but it helps," and more. They
want to dissect more precisely what these things say about someone.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to learn which conclusions we make about people are
accurate, and which not, so that people can better and more fairly
assess potential mates, workmates or employees. Gosling notes that
some employers prohibit the personalization of office spaces. Might
this damage morale? "The fact that wherever I go I see these
expressions of individuality leaking out makes me think it probably
isn't a good thing to do," he says. He plans to explore this further
with pairs of students, one of whom will get to decorate the living
quarters of the other. Effects on their psyches will be measured.</TE>
<TE>   "What, for instance, would happen if I made you trade your piranha
for an angel?" he says. "You'd probably find it very distressing."
As, very likely, would anyone who befriended me based on that angel.</TE>

<LD>Most of us love a challenge. At least we do when we feel the payoff
is worth it and we have the ability to do the job. When researchers
examined how people react to well-defined tasks compared to those
that are open-ended, they found that, sure enough, the ones that
didn't have a set limit caused the greatest cardiovascular response.</LD>
<LD>   In experiments reported in the journal Psychophysiology,
researchers asked college students to perform various tasks while
their heart rate and blood pressure were monitored. For instance,
they were told to push a button on a computer mouse every 10 seconds
at one-minute intervals. Then they were given what's called an
"unfixed challenge." They were asked to press the button as many
times as possible within a minute.</LD>
<LD>   Blood pressure and heart rate were consistently higher when the
students were attempting the unlimited task.</LD>
<TE>   What does this mean to the salesman without a quota or the
weightlifter with all the time in the world at the gym? Rex A. Write,
professor of psychology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
says, "It's probably in their best interest from a health point of
view to set reasonable goals rather than to work or work out as if
the sky was the limit."</TE>
<TE>   Study Contests IUDs' Bad Image</TE>
<TE>   One of the most convenient and effective forms of birth control,
the intrauterine device, can't shake its bad rap. Call it guilt by
association. In 1974 one IUD, the Dalkon Shield, was taken off the
market because it caused serious infections, and all other types were
tainted by the debacle. Before then, about one in 10 married American
women relied on IUDs for birth control. Now less than 1% do. The
reasons may be doctors' fear of lawsuits and a belief that IUDs cause
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection that can cause
infertility.</TE>
<TE>   The results of a survey of 400 doctors published in the February
issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that only 17% had inserted
more than 10 IUDs in the last year, despite the fact that more than
90% of the gynecologists knew that the device is safe and effective.
Twenty percent of doctors had not inserted a single IUD in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   According to the authors of the study, there is no evidence that
the doctors' fears about pelvic inflammatory disease are warranted.
Dr. Nancy Starwood, currently an assistant professor of obstetrics
and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New
York, says the risk of pelvic infection is less than 1% during the
three weeks following insertion of the device, and then drops steeply
to 0.14%.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that nearly half of the pregnancies in the U.S. are
unintended and that about half of those are because of contraceptive
failure or misuse, Starwood hopes that women and their doctors will
reconsider the option. "Now is the perfect time for the renaissance
of IUDs," she says. The research was performed at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   White Spots on Your Teeth</TE>
<TE>   Children and adults with white spots on their teeth may have too
much fluoride to blame. Although adding fluoride to water has been
the subject of controversy for years, a report published in the
Journal of the American Dental Assn. says other sources of fluoride
contribute greatly to enamel fluorosis, or tooth mottling. Excessive
fluoride consumption in early childhood when the permanent teeth are
forming creates the mottling.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers compared studies of enamel fluorosis in schoolchildren
in the 1930s with surveys done in the 1980s. There was a significant
increase in prevalence of the tooth mottling in the later decade
among children in communities with varying amounts of fluoride in the
drinking water, from the lowest to the highest levels. (Some of the
communities had naturally fluoridated water.)</TE>
<TE>   The explanation for the increase in fluorosis is that there were
many sources of the cavity-fighting chemical that didn't exist in the
1930s, such as prescribed supplemental drops and tablets.
Fluoride-containing toothpaste also became very popular during those
years.</TE>
<TE>   Tooth spotting was especially common among children who were 8
years old or younger between 1972 and 1983, when there were so many
sources of fluoride besides the water, says Dr. Eugenio D.
Beltran-Aguilar, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and coauthor of the study.</TE>
<TE>   Today many of these sources are rare, but one that remains
temptingly tasty is toothpaste with fluoride. That's one reason why
the ADA advises using only a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the
toothbrush. It's also smart to keep toothpaste out of young
children's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Sadness Depresses Immunity</TE>
<TE>   Another mind-body link has been made with the discovery that a
person's ability to resist infection may be diminished if he or she
is even mildly depressed. Because as many as 20% of elderly adults
have symptoms of mild but chronic depression, the results of a recent
study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology have serious health
implications.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that the immune cells of people with symptoms
such as sadness, insomnia and difficulty concentrating did not
proliferate in response to an invader as well as cells taken from
people without signs of depression.</TE>
<TE>   "These people may not heal as well after surgery and are more
prone to complications, and they are more likely to be hospitalized,"
says Dr. Lynanne McGuire, a researcher in the Behavioral Medicine
Clinic at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She and her colleagues
tested the immune responses of depressed and non-depressed people in
an 18-month study.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire says there is some natural decline in immunity with age,
but it could be made even worse by prolonged mild to moderate
depression, making a person more vulnerable to viral infections and
some kinds of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise Kicks In Drug Effects</TE>
<TE>   Exercise is good medicine, but medicines of the pharmaceutical
kind can cause problems when people work out more intensely than
usual, especially if they have any cardiovascular problems or are
taking several different drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians should alert active seniors to the side effects of
anti-hypertension agents, diuretics, antidepressants, tranquilizers,
diabetes drugs like insulin and sulfonylureas, and anticoagulants,
says Dr. Fred H. Brennan Jr., author of a paper in the current issue
of the Physician and Sportsmedicine. And if the doctor doesn't bring
up the subject, the patient should, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Even the 64-year-old triathlete can run into problems with, say,
beta blockers, says Brennan. "These drugs are designed to keep the
heart rate down. If a person's heart rate doesn't increase
appropriately with exercise, he may get dizzy."</TE>
<TE>   Brennan, one of the team physicians for the Ironman triathlon,
explains that tricyclic antidepressants can interfere with sweating,
causing a person to become overheated. Diuretics can lead to
dehydration, muscle cramping and a sudden drop in blood pressure. And
those beta blockers can mask jitteriness and other signs of
hypoglycemia, which could cause problems for a diabetic. If side
effects do occur, the prescription or the dose may need to be
changed.</TE>

<HD>Method Corrects Clubfoot, Sparing Infants Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clubfoot may be correctible without surgery in up to 90% of affected
infants, potentially sparing them the pain, complications and expense
of traditional treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The clubfoot deformity affects 1 in 750 to 1 in 1,000 babies, most
frequently boys. They are born with one or both feet turned inward
and pointed downward because of a tight, shortened Achilles' tendon.</LD>
<LD>   A drive to keep babies out of the operating room pushed some foot
specialists to revisit a nonsurgical technique developed at the
University of Iowa by Dr. Ignacio Ponseti more than 50 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Ponseti method, which involves gentle manipulation of the leg
followed by casting with thin plaster, can correct the problem as
well as surgery in 90% of affected babies, said Dr. Robert W.
Mendicino, president of the American College of Foot and Ankle
Surgeons, the professional organization of podiatric surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding foot surgery in infancy also potentially spares the child
repeated corrective procedures later on, Mendicino said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "The average person who has clubfoot surgery ends up with two to
three surgeries by the time they get to [their teens and 20s] and end
up with these really rigid feet," Mendicino said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mendicino said podiatric and orthopedic surgeons are finding
that the Ponseti method yields a proper correction in the vast
majority of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek
have documented its success in a study of 29 infants treated with the
method after other nonsurgical approaches proved ineffective.
Clubfeet in all but one of the infants were corrected with the
manipulation and casting, according to results presented this past
week at the podiatric group's annual meeting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the technique works:</TE>
<TE>   Doctors see the child several times in two to three months, each
time stretching and manipulating the affected leg for 10 minutes
before covering it from groin to toe with two sections of cast. Every
five to seven days the process is repeated, with total wearing time
typically six to 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Then the doctor usually makes a simple incision that releases the
shortened Achilles' tendon, which nine times out of 10 isn't released
by the casting alone. The tendon usually heals and reattaches in two
to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   This is a minor office procedure, requiring only local numbing and
a single stitch, compared with more extensive clubfoot surgery that
involves general anesthesia, major incisions and longer recovery,
Mendicino said.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the child is fitted with a pair of special shoes separated
by a metal bar to maintain the correct foot position. Those are worn
day and night for three months, and at night until about age 4,
Mendicino said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the method takes patience and expertise, it is less risky
and less costly than surgery. Clubfoot operations typically run
$3,000 to $5,000, while the casting runs about $1,200, with an
additional $50 for each set of shoes and another $50 for each bar.</TE>

<HD>Is It a Life or Death Question? Cancer Researchers Disagree</HD>
<DH>Studies are flawed and do not show lives are saved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald A. Berry, a member of the Physicians Data Query panel, is
chairman of the department of biostatistics at M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Were you surprised by the controversy?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: In a way, I was. Our deliberations had been low-key. We
proposed a modest change in the mammogram guidelines because we found
that the scientific evidence that mammography is beneficial is pretty
weak. Women have been oversold on screenings because there's so much
anxiety out there about breast cancer. Consequently, anything that
might help is viewed with great joy.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What prompted your committee to review their guidelines?</TE>
<TE>   A: Our conclusions about the benefits of mammograms were based on
the outcomes of seven studies that have been conducted around the
world. We knew these studies weren't perfect but there was an article
a few months ago in a scientific journal [the Lancet] which detailed
some serious flaws in this research. Our subsequent review agreed
with some of their critiques, and there was certainly a smoking gun
or two, in terms of potential biases in these studies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: So your committee concluded there is no benefit to having
mammograms?</TE>
<TE>   A: We went through lengthy discussions, and the issue is quite
complicated. But the key question is: Does having regular mammograms
reduce mortality? And we decided that was uncertain--and that's our
bottom line. No definitive studies have been done that really prove
mammograms are beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: If there is no benefit, then why do doctors continue to
enthusiastically recommend that women get them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Some [people] don't appreciate the importance of biases in
making observations in screening programs. What they observe is that
for women whose breast cancer is identified from mammograms, the
prognosis is extraordinarily better than for those whose cancer is
detected from a physical breast exam [by their doctors, a procedure
called palpation]. But it doesn't logically follow that a mammogram
is what made the difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are these biases?</TE>
<TE>   A: The first is the lead time bias. What that means is that you
can detect an aggressive breast cancer earlier with a mammogram than
you would by mere palpation. So instead of dying three years after
being diagnosed, patients might live seven more years. But all you're
really doing is moving the goal posts, and these women didn't survive
longer than they would have without the mammogram. They were just
diagnosed earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The other key bias is length bias, which is more subtle.
Mammograms tend to detect the smaller, slower-growing cancers that
take longer to kill women. Or the tumor might have grown so slowly
that they died of something else, and the cancer might not have been
discovered otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Palpation, in contrast, tends to identify the faster growing, more
aggressive cancers. These tumors often don't show up on routine
mammograms because they may develop between screenings. As a
consequence, since physical exams tend to find the more dangerous
tumors, mammograms--which pick up the less risky cancers--look good
in comparison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you account for the difference in the findings of your
committee and those of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which
based their recommendations on the same research?</TE>
<TE>   A: Two groups looking at the same data can come to different
conclusions. On the face of it, It looks like PDQ views it one way
and the task force views it another. But we're really not that far
apart in terms of our conclusions. We rated the quality of the
mammogram studies as low, while they rated them as fair, which is not
that different. Their conclusion is, essentially, "Sure, why not? It
can't be bad and it might be good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think the push for screenings lulled women into a false
sense of security--that by getting regular tests their cancers would
be cured?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think everyone is well-meaning. But we still don't know if a
small cancer that's picked up in a routine screening has already
metastasized [spread beyond the breast], and we still can't identify
which tumors are more dangerous. So there's always the potential for
unnecessary or ineffective treatment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the meantime, given all this conflicting information, what
should women do?</TE>
<TE>   A: The truth is we don't know. Women should find out about the
uncertainties associated with mammography, such as the risks of false
positives, and unnecessary surgery, as well as the inconvenience and
expense of getting screened. They should balance this against the
benefits, which are really quite modest even if you believe the test
results at face value.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you comfortable with the idea that some women who decide
not to get mammograms based on your committee's recommendation might
have breast cancer that might have been better treated if detected
sooner?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've thought long and hard about this and I don't feel
uncomfortable at all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you tell your own family?</TE>
<TE>   A: I tell my wife not to get screened. But she ignores me.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with other Olympic-obsessed Americans, I sat in my living room
and watched spellbound as Ross Powers, 23, Danny Kass, 19, and J.J.
Thomas, 20, threw wild stunts in the air and swept the medals in the
men's half-pipe. And it's not just guys who do corkscrews and catch
air. Girls do it too. Kelly Clark, 18, won America's first gold medal
in the women's half-pipe with her daredevil moves. Is there any sport
so cool?</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in my life I felt cheated by history. I'm 35
years old, and I was born 10 years too early. Raised a skier, I've
ridden a board four or five times. But not like that. I never got to
drop into a half-pipe, hang in the air or spin around upside down
with a plank strapped to my feet. When I was at my most daring, and
my bones had the most bounce, there were no boards to ride.</LD>
<LD>   The Olympics fired me up again. Last week I headed to the
mountains for a two-hour "Get Better Quick" snowboarding class at Big
Bear Mountain Resort. For $69 I got a board, some of those funky
space boots, a lift ticket and a lesson. I didn't dare to dream of
soaring 15 feet into the air like gold-medalist Powers, or throwing a
corkscrew spin and two upside down twists like silver-medalist Kass.</LD>
<TE>   Dude, I just wanted to get some "amplitude."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the hip lingo that NBC announcers tossed around
during the Olympics that is intimidating to those of my generation.
Snowboarding makes you feel old. Falls hurt, and you fall a lot. Just
getting up can be a feat. Every time you reach the top of the
mountain you have to sit on your rear in the snow to buckle in (at
Bear Mountain they provide benches to prevent you from getting a
soggy backside).</TE>
<TE>   Some geriatric boarders can get up facing downhill (and in the
snowboarding world, over 30 is geriatric). But stiffer adults have to
raise their feet into the air, roll over onto their knees like big
babies, and push up from the snow that way. Seeing your friends do it
is hilarious. Doing it yourself is humiliating.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, for the over-30 set, learning to board is a lesson in
humility. As adults, we generally stick to the things we are good at.
As I tumbled forward, backward and sideways, giving myself whiplash,
sore wrists and a tender tailbone, I reflected that after a certain
age, most of us structure our entire lives so as not to look stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have tossed pride to the winds, however, snowboarding
brings pure, bellyaching laughter of a sort I had not experienced
since childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding was born in the United States in the 1980s. From 1990
to 2000, snowboarding increased from 1.5 million participants to 4.3
million, a jump of 187%. Nationally, snowboarders make up about four
of every 10 people on the slopes, according to industry experts. The
numbers are even higher in Southern California. Winter sports
enthusiasts already are predicting that the high-profile medals in
the Olympic snowboarding events will propel the sport further into
the mainstream. The bulk of riders, though, are the young. From 1995
to 2000, skateboarding and snowboarding were the fastest-growing
sports for boys ages 7 to 17, according to the National Sporting
Goods Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Our class met at the foot of the hill just after lunch. After a
test on a tiny slope, we were divided into beginners, and slightly
more advanced boarders who could "link,'' or do turns.</TE>
<TE>   We ranged in ability from a 39-year-old skier-turned-snowboarder
(dubbed "stiff-leg" by our teacher) who spent most of his time on the
ground, to a South Bay dad who took up snowboarding three seasons ago
at 42. He carved curves with grace and athleticism and knew all the
lingo from a video he gave to his teenage son. ("That's a bonk," he
said, as we watched a girl in pigtails fly off a lip of snow, hit a
barrel and fly into the air.) Another 39-year-old dad from Hawaii, a
triathlete from Coronado and a bunch of kids rounded out the class.</TE>
<TE>   Our teacher Keith Bates, 30, took each of us where we were, and
tailored his advice to us personally.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of this is your attitude," he told us before
leading us up the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   When we reached the top, Bates, a bronzed boarder with a spiky
hairdo and a mischievous, easy smile, ran through a quick review of
snowboarding basics. Arms should be outstretched tip to tail. The
front hand points down the hill to guide you, the back hand stretches
behind to balance and steer you like a rudder. Drop either in a quest
for cool and you are doomed to go down. It feels counter-intuitive,
but you have to lean into the front foot. If you don't, you will
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Pick a word to center yourself," Bates told us all. "Whenever I
feel out of control, I say, 'Elephant.' "</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be good advice, because I felt out of control a
lot.</TE>
<TE>   For our second trip down the hill, Bates led us into a terrain
park. This was getting closer to my Olympic-induced snowboard
fantasy. There were no half-pipes, but there were a lot of jumps.
Bates told Mark Saroyan, our oldest and most skilled member, that he
was ready to "catch some air."</TE>
<TE>   "Bend your knees when you take off," Bates coached him. "Pretend
you are still on snow. Lean forward when you land. It's easier if you
get up some speed."</TE>
<TE>   I thought of the Olympians, effortlessly throwing 720s, and 1080s
off the lip of the half-pipe. I could do this.</TE>
<TE>   Bates took off the jump, easy, relaxed. He clutched his board in
the air like the Olympians. Awesome.</TE>
<TE>   Saroyan went next. We all yelled out, "Elephant!" He soared into
the air in perfect form, then disappeared. When we saw him next, he
was sliding on his back. I went for it. I got up some speed, flew
toward the sky, landed and crashed. The 12-year-old attacked the jump
most fearlessly of all. He took off, rotated 90 degrees in midair and
landed square on his tailbone. The older members of the class winced
in empathetic pain. He just bounced down the hill laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Although half our class was older than 30, only one of those
people was a really good skier. The best skiers, I suspect, are the
least likely to abandon what they know best and cross over to
snowboarding. Take my boyfriend. An elegant, aggressive skier, he
won't waste a day at a top ski resort on a snowboard. But he agreed
to try it for one day at Bear Mountain. After an hour or two in a
beginner class mastering the basics, they set him loose on the bunny
slopes.</TE>
<TE>   It is here, I realized, that the deep animosity between skiers and
snowboarders is born. The beginning boarders appeared ignorant of
slope etiquette, skills and spatial relations. I watched as my
boyfriend wove deliberately from one side to another, diligently
applying the lessons he had learned in class. Suddenly an
out-of-control grommet on a board took him out from behind. While my
man writhed on his back in pain, the youngster yelled at him: "Dude,
you can't be going back and forth like that!"</TE>
<TE>   It's a form of abuse most adults are unwilling to endure.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the terrain park, I jumped and jumped, and fell every
time. My fellow classmates watched and cheered each other on.</TE>
<TE>   "How far off the ground was I?" I asked Saroyan at one point. "A
foot?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, more than that," he said, generously. Twenty minutes before
the lifts closed, my hips, wrists and tailbone aching, I zipped off a
jump on the bunny slopes. There were no witnesses, no one to attest
to my "amplitude." But I caught some air and landed my mini-jump. I
was elated, a gold-medalist in my own mind.</TE>
<TE>   I dragged myself off the slopes bruised but happy. Bates, our
teacher, said novice boarders need to be careful. Newcomers fatigue
easily, as they use new muscles. That can lead to accidents. "Fatigue
will kill your snowboarding," he said. Done well, the sport looks
effortless, but frequent snowboarders will build up impressive thigh
muscles. "It is the greatest cardiovascular workout," Bates said.
"The only thing that would make it better would be to run up the
hill."</TE>
<TE>   In my case, despite the slow lift rides, long stretches of sitting
and slogging through the slush on a warm February day, I had burned
1,216 calories in four hours and 45 minutes. Even if my body was
thrashed it was a great workout.</TE>

<LD>Do mammograms save lives? Studies conducted in the 1970s and '80s
concluded that they do, and that regular screening can cut breast
cancer deaths by at least 30%. Women have long accepted this idea as
gospel--namely that if they dutifully get mammograms, their cancer
will be caught early enough to be treated.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists are now challenging this conventional wisdom. First,
Danish researchers determined that the original studies were so
flawed that there was no evidence that mammograms reduced the death
toll.</LD>
<LD>   Then in January, word leaked out that the Physicians Data Query
panel, cancer experts who advise the National Cancer Institute, were
coming to essentially the same conclusion. (The panel is scheduled to
release its formal report this spring.)</LD>
<TE>   Last month, a task force convened by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services weighed in with its findings, reaffirming the
value of mammograms in screening for breast cancer, and even went a
step further by urging women to start regular testing sooner--at age
40. The government previously had recommended mammography screening
beginning at age 50.</TE>
<TE>   The HHS and the NCI currently recommend screening every one to two
years. Women with a higher-than-average risk of breast cancer should
consult with medical experts as to whether they should begin
screenings before age 40, and how often they should be tested.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all this controversy, women are understandably confused about
whether to have a mammogram. We asked two experts in this debate to
help clarify some of the issues in order to help women make an
informed decision.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Alfred O. Berg, vice chairman of the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force on mammography, argues that women should have mammograms,
saying they can reduce breast cancer deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Donald A. Berry, a member of the Physicians Data Query panel of
cancer experts, says regular screenings aren't necessary for most
women and that the evidence supporting routine mammograms is weak.</TE>

<LD>Question: I'm 44 and in good shape. I have had this feeling of dull
muscle strain in my mid- to lower-right calf for approximately two
years. I have taken great strides to reduce any strain on the area
and have still been able to run without too much discomfort. However,
while running this past week, I did a lot of stretches before my run,
and I think I pulled a muscle in that same calf.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, I've been stretching and taking ibuprofen. Any
suggestions on what else to do?</LD>
<LD>   JOSH CROTTY</LD>
<TE>   Glen Cove, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You should definitely see a doctor and physical therapist
for your muscle strain. Two years is too long to experience the same
complications in your calf. By continuing to do physical activities
and stressing that area, you could end up with a more serious injury,
such as a muscle or tendon tear.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that stretching is a great preventive measure (when
done regularly), but with a case of tendinitis or some other overuse
injury similar to yours, too much stretching can prolong rather than
speed recovery. If it's OK with your doctor and physical therapist,
try a deep-muscle massage in the muscle group immediately above or
below the calf area. Additionally, do consistent range-of-motion,
stability and strength exercises for your legs and ankles.</TE>
<TE>   Apply ice post activity and apply heat when resting.</TE>

<HD>Aging the Modern Way</HD>
<DH>Growing older gracefully is being redefined as more
Americans are opting for cosmetic surgery after age 65.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between the ages 25 and 65, the nose stretches by 10%, on average,
its tip moving downward by about a quarter-inch. The brows can sink
by a third of an inch, the ears by slightly more, the cheek tissue by
as much as a half-inch. Overall, more than 30% of a person's facial
area may drop from above the mid-face line into fleshy folds below.</LD>
<LD>   "At some point you look in the mirror and you just can't believe
it's you," said B.J. Roberts, 71, of Los Angeles, who recently had
cosmetic surgery. "Everything is hanging, everything is sagging, and
you just want to feel uplifted."</LD>
<LD>   While most people who have cosmetic procedures done are
middle-aged, Roberts' generation is hardly being left behind. The
number of cosmetic procedures performed on people 65 and older has
more than tripled, to about 450,000, during the past five years,
according to statistics from organizations representing plastic
surgeons. The most common procedures for this group are face lifts
and eyelid surgery, and newer, nonsurgical techniques such as
chemical peels and Botox injections, which are used to smooth out
wrinkles.</LD>
<TE>   And the numbers are expected to soar in coming years--as the
oldest in the baby-boomer generation reach their 60s.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons have much to do with how long, and how well, older
Americans are living, researchers say. Seniors are more socially and
sexually active in their later years than ever before. Millions of
them are staying in the work force into their late 60s and 70s,
competing with younger workers for jobs and promotions. And in both
arenas, for better or worse, one's physical appearance matters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Pepsi generation, the Viagra generation," said Dr.
Loren Lipson, chief of geriatric medicine at the USC School of
Medicine. "You retire now, and there's no question you could have 20
or 30 years of life left--good, active years. We're living in a
society that is not only aging rapidly but living longer than ever
before, and in much better health, because of exercise and better
medications."</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, many doctors who treat older patients are reluctant to
recommend cosmetic work. It's expensive; there's always a risk of
disappointment; and people in their 70s and 80s often have health
concerns that are more pressing than looking "refreshed."</TE>
<TE>   There are no signs, however, that such concerns are dampening the
enthusiasm of seniors seeking cosmetic make-overs. The demand for
such services is particularly brisk in communities where more
affluent seniors have settled, particularly in Sun Belt states such
as Arizona, California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement enclaves, where active seniors spend their days on
golf courses and tennis courts, the usual reservations about surgery
and age have broken down. "We'll see patients at 75 who had a bypass
when they were 60, who are taking antihypertensive medications and
who have some arthritis. They've got two new hips, and here they come
off the tennis court saying, 'OK, doc, I want this, and I want
that,'" said Dr. David Morrow, a dermatologist and plastic surgeon in
Rancho Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Calvin Peters, a plastic surgeon in Orlando, Fla., estimates
that he sees about three times as many seniors in his office as he
did a decade ago. Other doctors estimate that as many as one in four
of their patients are age 75 and older--a sharp difference from a few
years ago. As long as they're medically stable and have no apparent
psychological problems, they're candidates for facial work, said
Morrow. "And you better not say the word 'old' to these people. They
don't like it at all."</TE>
<TE>   They don't like being treated as older, either, especially in the
workplace. Many older Americans complain that they've been
patronized, or made to feel invisible, by younger co-workers, said
Clare Hushbeck, who handles workplace discrimination cases for the
AARP. This perception is common among seniors across the professional
ranks, from clerks to upper management, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   'No Question This Is a Youth-Oriented Society'</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, it's just a feeling you get. You notice a change
in the way people treat you," said Eileen Barret, 68, an insurance
consultant in New York who recently had cosmetic facial surgery.
Younger colleagues "don't think you're as sharp, you're the old lady
in the group. Maybe they have a grandmother who looks like you ....
But there's no question this is a youth-oriented society, and if you
want to stay competitive, you certainly don't want to look tired. You
want to look alert, rested, like you've had a good sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Barret said she has no intention of retiring soon. "I'm not ready.
I love my work, and the fact is I feel the same way I did when I was
40," she said. After months of research about cosmetic procedures,
she concluded: "If I'm to have something done, now's the time. This
is my last hurrah."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors who specialize in treating seniors say this group is
certainly more socially--and sexually--active than any before.
Exercise, better health habits and new and improved medical
treatments, such as the sexual-dysfunction drug Viagra, have been
major factors in these changes, researchers said. "The rule of thumb
is that healthy individuals who were highly active sexually when they
were young and middle-aged are still going to be active late in
life," into their 70s and beyond, said Dr. Gary Kennedy, a geriatric
psychiatrist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery Restored the Face She Wanted</TE>
<TE>   Recently split from a husband of eight years, Roberts, the Los
Angeles woman, believes her cosmetic procedure helped restore life
and beauty to her face. She meditated for months on her decision. "I
was a wife and mother for a long time," she said, "and I felt that
now it's my turn."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach plastic surgeon Dr. James Wells said many of the older
patients he sees are widowed or divorced. "They're starting a second
life, they're looking for a partner, and appearance is very much a
part of the equation," he said. "They may not say it in exactly those
words, but that is the gist of it. They feel fine, and they want to
look as healthy as they feel."</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true of people who are accustomed to being the
most attractive person in the room, or who have relied on their looks
in their social or working lives, said Dr. Sandra Swantek, a Chicago
psychiatrist who has worked with elderly plastic surgery patients.
"As they age, people like this begin questioning their vitality. They
fear ageism, and for good reason," she said. "The real issue is that
our society we do not respect the honor and beauty of people growing
into their own skin."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Jolliff, 62, a Long Beach investment advisor, recently had
cosmetic facial surgery because he believed he looked older than his
age. At 6 foot 2 and 212 pounds, Jolliff, who is single, is only
slightly over his college football playing weight and still plays
basketball with men in their 30s. "I felt great. The only thing wrong
was my face looked 80 years old," he said. "When you've got a lot of
excess skin on your face, it doesn't look good, period, and I
couldn't help feeling bad about it." Since the surgery, Jolliff said,
"I'm ecstatic."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is so pleased, of course. Like any cosmetic surgery
patient, seniors run a risk of being disappointed with the results;
about 10% to 20% may feel this way after a procedure, doctors
estimate. Maybe an eyebrow is too high; maybe the face is pulled too
tight; sometimes patients are obsessive about their looks. Even some
relatively minor procedures, such as laser treatments and
dermabrasion--which remove layers of skin--have caused burns and
discoloration. "The fact is there's a lot of bad work out there,"
said Dr. Barry Weintraub, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. "If you
don't believe me, we can take a walk down Rodeo Drive."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is every senior citizen a good candidate for surgery. To
undergo a face, neck, or eye job, for instance, patients are heavily
sedated or put under general anesthesia for hours. The drugs doctors
use can be dangerous to anyone with an unstable heart condition, said
Dr. Raymond Roy, chairman of the anesthesia department at Wake Forest
University, in Winston-Salem, N.C. Cardiovascular disease is not
always evident, either. By virtue of age alone, the average
70-year-old has about double the risk of suffering silent heart
disease than an average 30-year-old, cardiologists say. "This is the
No. 1 thing we worry about in older patients," said Dr. Scott
Bartlett, a plastic surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   People with dementia, even mild forms, can wind up confused or
disoriented for hours after surgery, anesthesiologists say. And these
patients are not always easy to identify. "If the person is alert
enough to argue politics with me, then I don't worry about the
anesthesia," Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   For Some, Reasons May Be Tied to Mental Health</TE>
<TE>   In seniors, perhaps more than the middle-aged, a strong desire for
cosmetic work also raises questions about mental health. Does the
patient expect a nip and tuck to alter her life? Is the person
compulsively worried about some perceived defect? Most plastic
surgeons say they carefully check would-be patients for mental
problems, but some geriatric psychiatrists are not convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder how many older people who have cosmetic surgery are
really suffering from low-level depression," said Swantek, the
Chicago psychiatrist. What's considered minor depression in younger
people can have a profound impact on seniors' ability to function,
she said. Its hallmarks are social isolation, feelings of
worthlessness, underlying sensations of guilt and shame--precisely
the sorts of emotional undercurrents that could push someone toward
cosmetic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The shame and guilt about admitting you've had cosmetic work done
seems to be dissolving, by degrees, say seniors. In much of the
country, plastic surgery is still seen as a mark of excessive vanity.
Yet the popularity of topical skin procedures--the so-called
"lunchtime peels," for instance, and Botox injections--is helping to
break the stigma. Many women who have peels regularly even compare
them to facials.</TE>
<TE>   Merle Schwartz, 65, a former teacher and real estate agent
originally from Connecticut, said she never would have considered
plastic surgery until she began spending winters in the Palm Springs
area. Though she has had only peels herself, Schwartz said, facial
surgery "seems to be OK with people here in California, and I find I
no longer have strong judgment against it. It's so commonplace."</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder that cosmetic surgeons call peels and laser
treatments "starter" or "entry-level" procedures. "These are very
simple, inexpensive things that jump-start how you look," said Dr.
Scott Aaronson, a Palm Springs plastic surgeon. "From there many
people consider doing bigger things, for bigger results."</TE>
<TE>   And once committed to battling gravity with the knife, most
patients are in for the long haul. If they can afford it. Said Betty
Critser, 70, of Rancho Mirage, one of Aaronson's recent face lift
patients: "I told the doctor: 'I plan to live to 100. How many times
you can do this?'"</TE>

<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>Karen Voight is a Los Angeles-based fitness expert
whose latest videos are "Pure and Simple Stretch" and "YogaSculpt."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've probably all heard the notion that weight training will make
you muscle-bound and stiff--but that's a myth. Sure, some people who
have large muscles are not very limber, but that's because they spend
most of their time making their muscles bigger and do nothing to
improve their flexibility.</LD>
<LD>   A good weight-training routine improves both your strength and
your flexibility. A key factor is that you train each muscle group
through its entire range of motion, organizing your routine to work
all the muscles surrounding a particular joint. For instance, it's
best to train the front, sides and back of your shoulders in the same
session. Above all, you must not forget to stretch. That way you can
lengthen the tightened muscle while it is still warm and pliable. You
can stretch between sets or at the completion of your routine. Take
care to stretch specific muscles you just worked.</LD>
<LD>   So building a strong upper body, with a developed chest and
well-defined shoulders, doesn't mean you have to compromise any of
your flexibility in that area. Just make sure that along with your
incline presses or shoulder raises you also perform these two simple
stretching moves.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wall Lean</TE>
<TE>   Place the palms of your hands against a flat wall about shoulder
height and shoulder width apart. Your fingers should point up. Bend
forward at your hips and walk your feet away from the wall until your
ankles are directly below your hips. Your feet should be hip-width
apart.</TE>
<TE>   On an exhale, begin moving your upper body parallel to the floor.
Once you feel a slight stretch across your chest, press firmly into
your hands. Keep your elbows straight and try to rotate your tricep
muscles (the muscles in the backs of your upper arm) to face the
ground. This small movement brings the stretch deeper into your
shoulders and helps to release any tension held in your neck.
Remember to keep your abdominals pulled in toward your spine, and
don't allow your rib cage to protrude.</TE>
<TE>   Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds, relaxing and breathing.
Repeat two more times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seated Arches</TE>
<TE>   Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Place
your hands about 18 inches behind you, with your fingers pointed away
from your body. Exhale, slide your buttocks forward and bend one leg,
placing that foot on the floor for balance.</TE>
<TE>   As you inhale, spread your fingers, press down against your hands
and lift your chest forward, away from your hands. Squeeze your
shoulder blades together as much as you can without letting your
shoulders lift up toward your ears.</TE>
<TE>   Hold this stretch for 15 to 30 seconds while you continue to
breathe deeply. Focus on feeling an expanded chest and a lengthening
in the front of your shoulders. Repeat two more times.</TE>
<TE>   These stretches are easy to do yet very effective. They can be a
quick release if you feel tension in your neck and shoulders after
exercising, and they can be a refreshing way to start your day. Since
these simple moves open up the whole area across your chest, upper
arms and back, don't be surprised if your breathing and posture
improve almost immediately.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the movie "40 Days and 40 Nights," Josh Hartnett plays a virile
but vulnerable guy who gives up sex for Lent after a bad breakup. He
renounces women, hides his porno collection and eventually has a
buddy chain him down to keep his hands off himself.</LD>
<LD>   He avoids temptation until he meets Erica (Shannyn Sossamon) at a
laundromat, and struggles throughout the rest of the film to keep his
vow of chastity without losing her.</LD>
<LD>   Like Hartnett's character, I, too, am abstaining during Lent.
But my vow of chastity is not self-imposed. After 400 consecutive
sex-free days, I have given it up by default.</LD>
<TE>   I have no reason not to.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of the movies--where anyone with good looks, a hot body or
a pulse is hooking up--most of the rest of the world isn't.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the World Health Organization estimates that
approximately 100 million acts of sexual intercourse take place each
day. Assuming--optimistically--that each of those acts takes place
between 100 million different couples, only about 3% of the world's
population will have sex today.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty days? That's supposed to be a challenge?" asked
Abby Wilner, 26, co-author of "Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique
Challenges of Life in Your Twenties." "A challenge would be to find
sex in 40 days."</TE>
<TE>   With the threat of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases on
their minds, most people simply aren't rushing into bed with
strangers anymore. Ultimately, many single people say, a healthy
relationship is just as important as healthy sex, and they would
rather have no sex at all than sex with the wrong person.</TE>
<TE>   The dry spells can last weeks, months--gasp--even years.</TE>
<TE>   Patty, 30, hasn't had sex in three years. The Los Angeles finance
analyst who, like most people interviewed for this story, did not
want to use her full name, won't date men at work and doesn't like
meeting them in bars. Though many of her male friends have broadened
their dating pool as they become older, she finds herself becoming
more selective.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent lack of prospective mates, Patty is
determined not to go another year without some play.</TE>
<TE>   Her first New Year's resolution: Have sex.</TE>
<TE>   Her second New Year's resolution: Have lots of sex.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still trying to figure out how to launch that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alain, a 24-year-old medical student from Chicago, is also looking
for a suitable partner, that "one beautiful woman that will just
maybe want to settle down and have kids and all that."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he would like to have sex at least three times a
week.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't had any in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Although necessary for the propagation of the species, sex is not
nearly as vital as, say, food or water.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's ever died from a lack of sex," said Janet Hyde, a
professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   It just feels like it.</TE>
<TE>   People engage in intercourse for a variety of what Hyde calls
"high-minded benefits": to express their feelings for someone, exert
power over another and simply because it feels good. "There's a
distinction between what you need physically, which is nothing, and
what you would desire," Hyde said.</TE>
<TE>   To relieve pent-up sexual tension, many fill the void with
something else--smoking, eating or drinking, for example. Others
distract themselves by spending more time at work or picking up a
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   I tried knitting.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help.</TE>
<TE>   So I ran a marathon.</TE>
<TE>   "Periods of celibacy may be, for some people, helpful ways to
focus on other things," said Howard Ruppel, sexologist and chancellor
of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The longer a person goes without sex, however, the less
likely he or she is to want it. At some point, once the dry spell
becomes a real drought, some say it just makes sense to wait it out.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, it's not a recent memory that I necessarily miss,"
Patty said. "And the longer you wait, the harder it is to compromise
your standards. Anyone who has a full and active life wouldn't be so
concerned about this one thing because you had it before and you know
that you'll have it again."</TE>
<TE>   Some day.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, those who aren't having sex are going to have to live
vicariously through those who are.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll say this much, if I was getting sex as often as I'd like, 40
days would seem like a long time," Alain said.</TE>
<TE>   And for some, Hollywood reminds us, 40 days is a long time.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the film, Hartnett tried to give up sex. But, like
his character, he struggled. In a recent interview in Entertainment
Weekly magazine, he said he was able to abstain for only "a couple of
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to go 40 days and 40 nights," he said. "It made me
a little bit crazy, you know what I mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I do.</TE>

<LD>I have a way of losing track of time. Not knowing where I am and not
knowing what month it is have been two of my failings for as far back
as I can remember, and my memory is pretty good. Most of the time.</LD>
<LD>   It's just that I have a tendency to drift through life like some
kind of helium-filled balloon, happy with the drift but not always
paying attention to the ground below.</LD>
<LD>   That's how I missed Black History Month.</LD>
<TE>   I told myself at the start of February that I was going to
acknowledge the month by writing something about Alex Haley. Not just
because he was a good friend, but because with "Roots" he helped us
all understand the anguish and triumphs of an entire race, just at a
time when we needed it most.</TE>
<TE>   And I don't even think he realized that.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the kind of guy to celebrate himself. He gave speeches
mostly because he just liked to talk to people but shied away from
the glory heaped upon him after "Roots" hit the bookstores 26 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   I remember him trying to avoid a whole crowd of people who
recognized him at JFK as we were about to fly from New York back to
L.A. I'd been profiling him for the paper and was traveling with him
on his first cross-country speaking tour. The crowd of mostly black
people, many with tears in their eyes, wanted to be near him, to
touch him and to thank him for bringing Kunta Kinte into their lives.
And for helping to define a pain burned deep into their cultural
memory.</TE>
<TE>   Haley was both touched and confused by the adoration of the crowd,
and as we managed to get away he said, a tremor in his voice, "I was
just writing a book, not a bible."</TE>
<TE>   Haley died in 1992 at age 70. He'd telephoned a few days earlier
just to say hello. He'd call periodically from wherever he was, even
as far away as the island of Majorca, where he'd like to hole up and
write. We'd been friends since the early 1950s when he was a public
information officer for the Coast Guard in San Francisco, and I was a
young reporter for the Oakland Trib.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to write and had seen my feature pieces in the paper and
wondered if I'd like to freelance with him. We'd both do the research
and then trade off doing the first draft of whatever magazine piece
we were working on.</TE>
<TE>   I can't say it was the most successful writing team in history,
because we both wanted to do the story exactly the way we wanted to
do it. But it was the beginning of a friendship that nothing could
damage.</TE>
<TE>   We sold half a dozen or so magazine pieces here and there, but
mostly we got together to just talk. I heard all about his boyhood in
Henning, Tenn., and about how the Coast Guard had made him a "galley
boy" aboard ship before he managed to talk his way into his present
job, the first black man in the Coast Guard public information
office.</TE>
<TE>   We celebrated every time we sold anything, and the parties usually
ended up costing more than we'd made from the sale, but it was the
joy that mattered, not the money. I remember him saying, with a big
laugh, "We'll never get rich making nothing per story."</TE>
<TE>   Haley retired from the Coast Guard in 1962 and headed for New
York. He moved into Greenwich Village, starved, wrote for whoever
would buy his stuff, stayed one step ahead of his landlord and
eventually produced "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." And then, with
the financial help of Reader's Digest, he began a 12-year journey of
research that produced "Roots."</TE>
<TE>   I've lost track of how many millions the book sold and into how
many languages it was translated. The TV miniseries based on the book
was watched by more than 100 million viewers in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Haley was rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams, and it
frightened him. I spent two weeks with him on that cross-country trip
I mentioned earlier, and was surprised at how unnerved he was by his
new stature. It was beyond author, beyond social historian, beyond
storyteller. Like it or not, Alex Haley had transcended all that to
become a racial icon. When he died of a heart attack  in Seattle, we
all lost a hero.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, 1,500 people from across the United
States--celebrities and ordinary folks--gathered in a small
Knoxville, Tenn., park to witness the unveiling of a statue in
Haley's honor. I was there.</TE>
<TE>   It was a 13-foot-tall bronze representation of the man with a book
on his lap, looking off toward eternity. At the time, it was the
largest statue in the nation of any African American. Maybe it still
is. His former wife, Nannie Haley, looked up at the sculpture by L.A.
artist Tina Allen and said, "He doesn't just belong to us anymore. He
belongs to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   As I think back on my shy, unassuming friend and what he gave us,
I realize that it doesn't really matter that I didn't write about him
during Black History Month. He doesn't need a month. Like Nannie
Haley said, he belongs to us all.</TE>

<HD>More Boys Are Reporting Sexual Harassment at School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last September, a sixth-grade boy in Cahokia, Ill., was sexually
harassed by another sixth-grade boy, who touched him inappropriately
in the bathroom. The alleged perpetrator was suspended after the
incident was investigated by police.</LD>
<LD>   Sexual harassment in middle school and high school often conjures
images of boys as predators and girls as victims but, increasingly,
boys are reporting incidents of unwanted sexual attention--from other
boys and from girls--due to consciousness-raising education and the
advent of new school policies. Sexual harassment as it occurs in
schools, is broadly defined as "unwanted and unwelcome sexual
behavior that interferes with your life," according to the American
Assn. of University Women, or AAUW, a nonprofit organization based in
Washington, D.C., that provides funds to foster equity and positive
societal change.</LD>
<TE>   The organization commissioned a national survey of 2,064 eighth-
through 11th-grade students about sexual harassment. The results were
published  in June in a report titled "Hostile Hallways: Bullying,
Teasing and Sexual Harassment in School." Examples of harassment, the
authors wrote, can be sexual comments, jokes, gestures, spreading
sexual rumors about someone, writing sexual messages or graffiti
about someone, touching, grabbing or pinching someone's body, pulling
clothing off or down, forcing someone to do something sexual and
calling someone gay or lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   While girls are still more likely to be sexually harassed in
school (83% of girls said they had been sexually harassed compared to
79% of boys), boys are reporting it more frequently than they did in
1993, according to the survey, which was conducted by Harris
Interactive. About 56% of boys reported that they had "occasionally"
been sexually harassed in school, while 30% reported it happened
"often" (compared to 49% and 24%, respectively, according to 1993
figures). Students reported that sexual harassment was mostly
peer-on-peer, and both genders stated that verbal sexual harassment
was worse than physical. Boys are more likely than girls, the
researchers found, to tell no one.</TE>
<TE>   William Pollack, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and director of the Centers for Men and Young
Men at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., said boys keep the
harassment to themselves because they are flummoxed, ashamed or fear
looking vulnerable. Among those who do report, the study indicated,
boys say they are sexually harassed by a solitary boy (25%) or a
group of boys (14%) far less frequently than they are by girls.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest put-down for boys between the ages of 5 and 19 is
'you are a [homosexual epithet]' or 'you are a girl,'" said Pollack,
author of "Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood,"
(Random House, 1998) and "Real Boys' Voices" (Penguin, 2000). "We
have a major illness in America and it is called homophobia. Boys
will put other boys down in this way to prove their masculinity."</TE>
<TE>   When a ninth-grader was asked by AAUW interviewers why he didn't
tell anyone about being taunted, he responded unemotionally: "Because
I'm a guy and I don't care. I'm not so insecure that if someone says
I'm gay it's gonna bother me. I'm not, so who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   Another boy, whose comment underlined the "casual homophobia" in
school, said: "It was a joke, and you just call him fag back and move
on with your life."</TE>
<TE>   This is typical of how boys cope with being called homosexual
epithets and it is also what perpetuates the almost ritualistic use
of the word in school, said Pollack, who added that some boys see
sexual harassment one dimensionally.</TE>
<TE>   "A boy told me recently, 'I thought sexual harassment was when
boys do bad things to girls,'" recounted Pollack. "So I said 'What
happens when boys do bad things to boys or girls do bad things to
boys?' The boy said 'I don't know ... it's upsetting. If I respond to
it, I am not sure what my actions should be. If I talk to anyone
about my confusion or pain, I will be seen as a wimp.' I said 'What
do you do?' He said 'I keep my mouth shut.' This is the boy code."</TE>
<TE>   Both boys and girls (74% and 73%, respectively) regarded being
called gay or lesbian as "very upsetting," popular television shows
such as "Will &amp; Grace" notwithstanding. But human sexuality educator
Debra Haffner said that generally the context of harassment for boys
and girls differs.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls are harassed about being heterosexually attractive; girls
who are early developers are taunted about their breast size and
innuendo is made about their sexual behavior, whereas the context of
a boy's sexual harassment is often about the possibility that he is
homosexual," said Haffner, author of "Beyond the Big Talk: Talking to
Your Teenager About Sex" (Newmarket Press, 2001). "The sexual
innuendo and teasing is all about what a boy might have done with
another boy."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, sexual harassment can be worse for boys, said
Haffner, director of the Chicago-based Religious Institute on Sexual
Morality, Justice and Healing, a nonprofit group dedicated to a
progressive vision of religion and sexuality. "If you are a girl
teased about being sexually aware, there can be some status
conferred," she said. "But there is no status in being a boy and
being teased about being gay. And often the boys are not gay; of
course this makes the environment very hostile for those who are
struggling with sexual orientation."</TE>
<TE>   It's even more hostile for boys who are openly gay. But the AAUW
researchers' evidence reveals that boys are most likely to be taunted
by girls, and they are more frequently harassed physically by girls
than verbally. But many boys are ambivalent about the sexual
attention of girls.</TE>
<TE>   "Many boys don't know how to respond to romantic advances of
girls," said Pollack, who added that many girls are now more
aggressive in their pursuit of boys in middle school, when many are
more interested in basketball and hanging out in boy packs. "Some
boys don't consider sexual attention harassment. They feel if they
pull away they look like nerds or shy or they feel that they have to
respond with sexual bravado, which is what society teaches young boys
they are supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Boys often confuse sexual harassment with positive sexual
attention, said the AAUW authors of the study. An 11th-grade boy's
response in the study illustrates the point: "Not too bad ... I like
just about all sexual contact." A 10th-grade boy said that his
reaction to sexual harassment "depends on whether it's a fine or
beautiful girl and what the situation is."</TE>
<TE>   What researchers at the AAUW found most disturbing is that the
incidence of sexual harassment has not declined in the last eight
years, the victims are also perpetrators and almost all students were
well-versed in their school's sexual harassment policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there is a disconnect between the policies at school and
students putting into practice the message," said Janalee
Jordan-Meldrum, senior program officer for community and K-12
programs for the AAUW, who is on the task force to develop programs
aimed at decreasing sexual harassment in schools.</TE>

<LD>THE WISE WOMEN OF HAVANA</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Jose Raul Bernardo</LD>
<TE>   HarperCollins/Rayo</TE>
<TE>   324 pages; $24.95</TE>
<TE>   In his first novel, "The Secret of the Bulls," Jose Raul Bernardo
vividly depicted the high cost of machismo culture in his native
Cuba--and the subtle yet courageous ways in which a wise and loving
woman could mitigate its excesses. In his latest novel, "The Wise
Women of Havana," Bernardo not only returns to this theme, but even
to the same family: genial, blond Maximiliano, a spirited,
freethinking, music- and poetry-loving butcher of German descent, and
his gentle, charming and wise wife Dolores, who was spurned by her
family for marrying a man they deemed below her station.</TE>
<TE>   By now, it is 1938: Cuba is suffering from the Great Depression
and Maximiliano and Dolores' youngest child, the curvaceous blond
Marguita, has just married handsome young Lorenzo, who works at a
bookstore. Madly in love, the young couple has moved in with his
parents' family: stiff, formal Spaniards who came to Cuba in 1902,
grew successful in the wine business only to suffer a severe
financial setback in the Depression. Living with his family will
enable Lorenzo to save on rent while helping out his parents with a
weekly stipend. Reserved, rather somber, Lorenzo's relatives could
not be more different from Marguita's fun-loving, emotionally
demonstrative Cuban folks.</TE>
<TE>   But, although Marguita is prepared to make some adjustments, it
soon becomes clear that the situation is intolerable when, one night,
as the young newlyweds are engaged in passionate lovemaking, Marguita
is shocked to see Lorenzo's solemn, horse-faced spinster sister Lolo
standing in the doorway staring at them. Without further ado,
Marguita, her husband in tow, moves back to the barrio to live near
her parents. The ever-helpful Dolores helps them settle in, happy to
have her favorite child so close by again. But a feud has been born.
Marguita's heart burns with the desire for revenge, and not even
Dolores seems able to persuade her to forgive her sister-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   For men, we learn, are not the only ones infected by the unwritten
code of honor, pride and vengeance. Marguita feels the same need:
"This is what her criollo heart keeps telling her she must do: Avenge
yourself. This is what the criollo world in which she has lived all
her life commands her to do: Avenge yourself. Affronts must be paid
for--the criollo code demands it--for only then can the affronted
person live honorably. This is the same code that forces a man to
cleanse his soiled honor by killing not only his adulterous wife but
her lover as well. Criollo men are not the only ones who have to live
by this code. Criollo women must, too."</TE>
<TE>   But there are other values--wiser, more compassionate and even
more strongly held. These are the values that guide Dolores' actions
and that she tries to pass on to her charming but stubborn daughter.
At the same time, the reader (unlike Marguita, Lorenzo, Dolores and
the rest of the family) also gets to learn about Lolo's lonely
existence, her shyness, her sense of inferiority. Tall, slender and
striking, Lolo has a good job as a telephone operator but has no idea
how to cope with the impudent fellows who leer at her on the streets.
Only when she meets a gentle, attractive young priest does she begin
to feel the stirrings of love. But a priest?</TE>
<TE>   Bernardo builds his novel from the literary equivalent of solid
blocks of vivid, contrasting colors: the groom's staid Spanish
family, the bride's gregarious Cuban one; the pious priest, the
freethinking butcher; the privations of the Great Depression, the
miraculous abundance of food and drink at communal feasts. But unlike
fiction that relies on crude contrasts between good and bad, black
and white, "The Wise Women of Havana" shows a painterly delight in
the sheer variety of colors, and suggests ways in which contrasting
hues can be shaped into a harmonious pattern, not so much by the
designing hand of Fate, but by the sagacity and persistence of women
(and men) like Dolores.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, although it touches upon a number of somber, highly
fraught areas of experience, including jealousy, revenge, unwanted
pregnancy, economic hardship and forbidden passion, there is an
almost fairy-tale quality to the narration and story line.
Occasionally, Bernardo finds himself on the wrong side of the line
between genuine sentiment and facile sentimentality, but certainly
not often enough to mar the reader's enjoyment of the story he tells
so winningly.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the novel is also available in a Spanish edition:
"Las Sabias Mujeres de la Habana." With its clear language,
soothingly repetitive sentence patterns and dramatic story, it might
also be a good book in both versions for English-speaking readers who
are learning Spanish and Spanish-speaking readers learning English.</TE>

<HD>Murder-Suicides Are Rarely the Result of a 'Pact'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KORKY VANN</AU>
<BD>THE HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Terminally Ill Man, 87, Kills 86-Year-Old Wife and Then Self."</LD>
<LD>   "Older Couple's Deaths Called Murder-Suicide."</LD>
<LD>   "Illness May Have Played a Role in Elderly Couple's
Murder-Suicide."</LD>
<TE>   Headlines such as these give the words "till death do us part"
ominous new meaning--and related statistics are even more alarming.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, more than 500 homicide-suicides, or 1,000 deaths, occur
among people 55 years and older, and experts say those figures are
increasing. Older adults are now twice as likely as younger adults to
commit such acts. The causes are complex, but topping the list are
undiagnosed depression, failing health, caregiver stress and loss of
independence and control.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, a mutual romantic "pact" to head into
eternity together rarely exists.</TE>
<TE>   "Nearly 20 older Americans die each week in a homicide-suicide.
For the most part, these are not crimes of love or altruism; they're
acts of depression and desperation," says University of South Florida
professor Donna Cohen, a nationally recognized expert who has been
researching and collecting data on the phenomenon for a decade. "To
call them 'pacts' is inaccurate. They're not joint decisions.
Ninety-nine percent of the time, the husband makes the decision to
kill his wife and himself. She's not a willing or knowing
participant."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who gathers data through interviews with families and
medical examiners, says there are three types of homicide-suicide in
older couples. The most common scenarios involve a depressed, elderly
man caring for a sick, suffering wife, or, less frequently, spouses
who are both sick and dependent on each another. In both situations,
the man faces an unwanted change in the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe there's going to be a move to a nursing home. Maybe it's a
decline in health, perceived or real, his or hers," says Cohen.
"These men, who all their lives have been in charge, are suddenly
helpless. They're hopeless. They can't care for and protect their
wife anymore, and they see no other way out than death."</TE>
<TE>   Almost a third of elderly homicide-suicides occur when there is a
history of marital problems or domestic violence. Common factors
include a pending or actual separation, threatening behavior and
restraining orders against the husband. For example, when 78-year-old
Josephine Giaimo of East Haven, Conn., was killed in July by her
estranged husband Frank (who then killed himself), she had already
filed for divorce and gotten two restraining orders to protect
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these men are controlling personalities, used to having
things their way," says Cohen. "But whatever the situation,
homicide-suicides are aggressive acts perpetrated out of depression
and an inability to make things better."</TE>
<TE>   In almost all cases, the preferred method is guns.  Most victims
are shot and killed in their sleep. Most perpetrators are middle- or
upper-class men. Almost all elderly men who attempt a murder-suicide
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite discouraging statistics, Cohen says there are often things
family members and friends can do to help prevent these tragedies.
Because the husband is usually the perpetrator, she suggests watching
for the following signs in a spouse, father or male relative: a
history of controlling behavior, changes in eating or sleeping,
crying for no apparent reason, talk of hopelessness, threats to harm
the wife, loss of interest in activities that used to give pleasure,
anxiety, and giving things away that are important to them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are at all concerned, don't be afraid to sit down with
your dad and say directly, 'Have you ever thought you or you and mom
would be better off dead?'" says Cohen, who is developing an
intervention plan for at-risk individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry about giving him ideas. If the answer is yes, ask him
if he has a plan. The more detailed the plan, the higher the risk.
Ask whether there are any guns in the house and if there are, remove
them. Call a crisis hotline in your area or seek the help of a
geriatric specialist. These are lethal, traumatic events that impact
families and communities, but in many cases they can be averted."</TE>

<LD>Artists from many different cultures and time periods have painted
pictures of soldiers, battles and wars. "Man in Armour Holding a
Pike" by the 17th century Dutch artist Jan van Bijlert is one
example. When he made this painting, Holland was in a long war to
gain its freedom from Spain.</LD>
<LD>   The soldier in Van Bijlert's painting is dressed in a finely
crafted suit of armor and looks back over his shoulder, as if on
guard. He holds a weapon called a pike and is ready to strike if
threatened. The helmet and armor are the soldier's uniform. The
elegant orange sash at his waist and fancy blue and orange plumes on
his helmet identify him as a member of the Dutch forces--in the same
way that sports teams today have special colors on their uniforms.</LD>
<LD>   Like other artists of his time, Van Bijlert was fascinated by
light and shadow. Notice how light reflects off the soldier's armor
and helmet, making the metal look hard and shiny. A dramatic shadow
conceals the man's eyes as he seems to carefully assess the
situation. If necessary, he will go into battle bravely.</LD>

<LD>"Constance: A Story of Early Plymouth"</LD>
<LD>   by Patricia Clapp</LD>
<LD>   The room is filled with dying people lying on the floor. Moaning
and cries of agony fill the room. This is a scene that Constance
faces in the book.</LD>
<TE>   Constance was a young woman who traveled to Plymouth in the early
1620s. Her life was filled with sorrows and hardship, but the book
has a fabulous ending. To find it out, read this exciting book based
on a real person.</TE>
<TE>   --Hanna, 10, home school, Twin Peaks</TE>
<TE>   "Artemis Fowl"</TE>
<TE>   by Eoin Colfer</TE>
<TE>   This book is like "Harry Potter," but I think it is better.
Artemis Fowl is descended from criminal masterminds. He has an evil
plan to make money. He kidnaps a fairy named Holly Short from the
LEPrecon squad (LEP stands for Lower Elements Police). They aren't
exactly Tinker Bells from "Peter Pan." They are armed and very
dangerous. Everything is going according to plan until the fairies
don't listen to the rules.</TE>

<HD>Watch Her Simmer</HD>
<DH>Smoldering as she cooks, Britain's Nigella Lawson serves up
irony and sensuality with her comforting recipes, the stuff of two
bestsellers and a television show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nigella Lawson, the best-selling British cookbook author and
television sensation, is leaning over the bread counter at Citarella,
one of New York's iconic food emporiums and a place where the loaves
and fishes never stop multiplying.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, at a less chic store, she was tempted by sugary and
brightly packaged American junk treats like Hershey's candy-coated
sprinkles. But here she settles on a fruity focaccia to accompany her
back to London. The Oxford-educated daughter of a Tory party
stalwart, Lawson was in town for four days to promote her second
cookbook and the U.S. debut of her TV show, "Nigella Bites."</LD>
<LD>   "Can you wrap it for an overnight trip?" she asks, repeating the
question, as her posh accent gets in the way. But at Citarella--which
began life as a fish market--they've seen everything, and the man
behind the bread counter soon figures out just how to help this
striking, Rubenesque woman.</LD>
<TE>   And really, who wouldn't want to?</TE>
<TE>   The British, who are not exactly famous for their appreciation of
fine food, have responded overwhelmingly to Lawson's sensuality and
intelligence, and to the unaccustomed spectacle of a woman who loves
to eat.</TE>
<TE>   If American television viewers miss a few words because of her
broad vowels or fail to understand the atavistic lure of mushy peas
(a British staple which, in her interpretation, calls for almost a
stick of butter, creme fraiche and frozen peas), what does it matter?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm British and you can't take that out of what I am," she
replies after being asked if she will adjust her show for a U.S.
audience. "I think TV is a really an odd thing, but basically people
don't listen to what you're saying. They like the cut of your jib or
not."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, you could call her the un-Martha Stewart:
inefficient and insouciant, she seems incapable of taking herself too
seriously. Even when she is describing the tragic succession of
deaths in her immediate family--her mother, sister and husband John
Diamond, 47, all died of cancer--she somehow manages to do so with
irony.</TE>
<TE>   "I put on about half a stone [seven pounds] the two days after
John died," says the 42-year-old Lawson, who lost her husband a year
ago. "It was incredibly annoying. At least you'd think you might get
nice and waif-like."</TE>
<TE>   Lawson's television show, filmed in the smallish kitchen of her
west London townhouse, displays a similarly wry attitude. When she's
not comparing making mayonnaise to reading Henry James, she is
arching an eyebrow or offering a sly half-smile. (Apparently, the
Brits put irony in their water instead of fluoride.)</TE>
<TE>   In one segment of the program, which airs Saturdays on E! and
Style network, after she has finished making that most English of
desserts, trifle, the viewer next sees her dressed for bed in a gray
satin robe, padding through her darkened kitchen while reading a
travel magazine. Opening the refrigerator, she spoons up some of the
creamy pudding and happily puts it in her mouth. The screen then goes
dark.</TE>
<TE>   "I like cooking food I like eating," she explains. "I let greed be
my guide. I'm not aiming to produce anything in particular."</TE>
<TE>   And that casually sybaritic approach is what comes across. She's
the first to proclaim she's not a chef, and that her series is not
about restaurant-style cooking. She is not surrounded by dozens of
little bowls filled with pre-measured ingredients. In fact, her loyal
TV fans, in order to be certain of precise quantities, are pretty
much forced to make educated guesses--or else to fork over the cash
to buy her actual cookbooks, "How to Eat" and "How to Be a Domestic
Goddess."</TE>
<TE>   She also does not do those intimidating tricks with knives.
Rather, she pounds, tears and tosses with her hands. When she needs
parsley, she grabs a chunk from a plant on her counter and snips away
with scissors. You sense her exhaustion in the kitchen, and her joy.</TE>
<TE>   We also learn a lot about the home life of this now-single mother,
whose young widowhood has been the common property of an entire
nation, thanks to her celebrity and that of her late husband, a
well-known columnist and television journalist. We see her picking up
her kids, Cosima, 8, and Bruno, 5, from school or typing at her
computer or pawing through her freezer only to turn up a slab of
frozen bacon in a Baggie.</TE>
<TE>   She uses only one cameraman and, clearly, he aspires to the
artistic. For example, on a rainy afternoon, he frames Lawson alone
in a window seat, eating and peering soulfully out at her wet garden.
There are frequent romantic, soft-focus shots of her with her
children, and the soundtrack aims for authenticity, letting us hear
the soft shrrrr of a sauce as it is being whisked.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to decide exactly how much of the visual and verbal
innuendo is intentional. After all, the linking of food and sex is
something long taken for granted. But to see Nigella Lawson licking
her fingers is somehow different from watching Julia Child do the
same. And her vocabulary of culinary adjectives also seems to be
highly coded: a sauce for pasta is described as "voluptuous," "gooey"
and "unctuous."</TE>
<TE>   When she's finished making one of her dishes, we see her rubbing
her hands together and cooing happily, "Yum, yum." Hmmm, hmmm?</TE>
<TE>   With a profusion of dark auburn hair cascading around her
heart-shaped face, those gorgeous swollen lips, her velvet-pool eyes
and all that yum-yumming, Lawson might be dubbed the Queen of Come-On
Cooking.</TE>
<TE>   She professes to be appalled that people come away from her show
remembering the luscious sensuality of her ample bosom instead of her
rich bounty of food. During this interview, she is wearing a deep
V-neck black sweater, a long black skirt, suede stiletto boots and
pale makeup. Stretched out on the couch in the lobby of her hotel,
she resembles nothing so much as a zaftig Jennifer Connelly. Or is it
Liv Tyler playing a grown-up Bridget Jones?</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that people might think I'm being coquettish--this makes
me sick," she says. "I always think I'm kind of friendly. I try to
speak intimately but not in a kind of boudoir sense but rather in a
kind of girl-to-girl girlfriend sense. The idea that it's meant to be
come-hither ... uuhhgg." She makes a face.</TE>
<TE>   So far the Yank media has fallen all over itself for this imported
appetite amazon. She has been portrayed adoringly in print and
television interviews. Even the food world has welcomed her. Gourmet
called her "England's It Girl." And, there are more than 1.5 million
copies of her cookbooks in print.</TE>
<TE>   Stardom, Then Backlash</TE>
<TE>   Her fellow countrymen, on the other hand, soon after a poll of
British males voted her the third most beautiful woman in the world,
began registering a small backlash. Indignant noises about the title
of her new baking book, "How to Be a Domestic Goddess" (with its
kitschy endpapers of aproned 1950s housewives), first were heard, and
then a clutch of women columnists wondered if all her gushing over
mushy peas and trifle wasn't simply a way of luring their sisters
back into domestic servitude. Fame, it seems, made the overripe cook
ripe for parody.</TE>
<TE>   But Lawson, who sees herself primarily as a journalist, is
aggressively self-deprecating and understands what it's like to come
upon such an easy target: "If I had been writing [my own] weekly
column still and someone had written 'How to Be a Domestic Goddess,'
that would have been my column for the week, too.... I respect the
need for a subject."</TE>
<TE>   And she also wishes to set the record straight about whether she
is some poster girl for post-feminism: "I feel that in a sense this
is probably the first time in women's history where you can have the
option of cooking or not. In fact I'm talking about it as a hobby,
really. That you can say, 'I choose to do this.' I can indulge this
fantasy of a little domestic shimmering because I am not obliged to
occupy this role against my will."</TE>
<TE>   If she has a role model in the kitchen--and perhaps in life--it is
her late mother, Vanessa Salmon, an elegant heiress who by all
accounts was a beautiful bohemian who, when called upon to do so,
could cook wonderfully. Yet when she wasn't turning out the perfect
roast chicken, this maternal goddess was at the center of London's
most charmed social circles.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson's father Nigel, a former journalist himself, became
Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Lawsons had four
children before their divorce in 1980. Both remarried. Five years
later, when Nigella was 25, her mother died suddenly of liver cancer.
Three months before Nigella's first child was born, her younger
sister Thomasina died at 32 of breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson says the loss of these women partly explains why food
became the center of her professional life: "I started writing about
food to continue something that had gone on in my house."</TE>
<TE>   But there is something else going on in her kitchen. It is very
soothing and intensely grounding to watch Lawson in her sneakers and
denim jacket separating an egg from palm to palm (never
shell-to-shell for fear she'll pierce the yolk). She's not about
showing off or achieving perfection. For her, the greatest
satisfaction--and you really believe her--lies in feeding her kids
something simple and delicious like a rich and steamy tomato sauce
with meatballs over homemade pasta.</TE>
<TE>   And she's serious about the If-I-can-do-this-so-can-you attitude
that is sometimes the bogus mantra of the TV chef-celebrity. "I think
most people are made to disparage home cooking," she says. "If all
they get from me is that they ignore every single recipe I've cooked
but think they're going to do something that they want to cook
because it's not fancy and it's just ordinary food but it's their
version of it, I feel that's successful."</TE>
<TE>   A Well-Bred Waitress</TE>
<TE>   For her part, she has done it her way throughout her life.
Although she attended the best schools, she was not a brilliant
student and switched schools five times before college. Despite her
family's position and connections, she sought sales jobs in London
department stores and worked as a waitress. She moved to Florence for
a period to learn Italian and supported herself as a chambermaid.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after going on to study modern languages at Oxford, she
began a career in publishing, and became deputy literary editor at
the Sunday Times. She signed on eventually as restaurant critic for
the Spectator but never stopped being, as she put it, a proper
journalist, writing on everything from makeup to anti-Semitism in the
former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   She met John Diamond when she was at the Times, where he was a
columnist, and, in one version of their courtship, they married on a
whim while vacationing in Venice. As someone who regularly ate her
cooking and passed through her kitchen, he was the first to suggest
she might have a cookbook in her.</TE>
<TE>   And the truth is, Lawson's fame--the point at which she became a
one-name star a la Diana--came in part because of her husband's
illness. Ever the man of words, he documented his oral cancer in a
newspaper column and in a book that was turned into a BBC TV drama,
"A Lump in My Throat." In his last years, unable to eat or speak
because his tongue had to be removed, Lawson became his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned me from being a quiet person to a constantly talking
person," she once said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even talking about the ghastly decline of her husband, Lawson
is not morbid. She is instead open, about her own pain or how her
kids are coping. She is even able to be relaxed about the voracious
public interest in the fact that she has been dating Charles Saatchi,
the art collector and advertising mogul, even about the rumors they
might marry. "No, no," she says, and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   She is forging ahead on her own, writing another book due out in
the fall and still feeding her kids bacon despite their recent
threats to go vegetarian. One of the few things she seems to resent
is being reduced to a stereotype, and having others dictate what she
should or should not be.</TE>
<TE>   Like, for example, thin.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she wants to be thinner. She just doesn't want to have
to be one of those emaciated "black trouser-suited New York women."
She is disrespectful, in fact, when it comes to a particularly famous
one from the high-end fashion press. "I wouldn't want to be like
that. I find it bloodless. I don't have the discipline and I don't
have the drive and I am not prepared to go to a gym every day and
have lettuce and black coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lawson confesses that before coming to New York for
her publicity blitz, she panicked and managed to put on 10 pounds,
having stayed in bed eating Toblerone.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I just thought, 'My God, everyone in Manhattan is so skinny I
can't bear it,'" she says, sighing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she is already vowing to go on a "massive diet of
self-denial" once she gets home.</TE>
<TE>   But wait!</TE>
<TE>   Before the Lady of the Larder departs with her focaccia, she
orders takeout from one of the best Chinese kitchens in New York.
Yum, yum: empty cartons of moo shu pork and orange chicken will
litter the room she vacates to catch that redeye back to London.</TE>
<TE>   So there.</TE>

<HD>A Place Created for Women's Personal Refuge</HD>
<DH>A shelter helps those who fled Africa's turmoil only to
find themselves at the mercy of domestic violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BOORSTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morning glories spill over the fence surrounding a large two-story
stucco house in Hollywood. The lawn is freshly mowed, the roses in
the garden have been pruned and in the backyard a kids' climbing
structure sprouts from a mini-playground. It appears to be the home
of a family with young children and, in a way, it is. It is Refugee
Safe Haven, a residential shelter for battered women and their kids.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. County has 25 short-term emergency shelters for victims of
domestic violence but only a handful of residential shelters like
this one. Refugee Safe Haven caters mostly to refugees and
immigrants, primarily Africans.</LD>
<LD>   An outgrowth of the African Community Resource Center, the
four-bedroom, four-bath shelter opened a year ago. Since then, women
from countries such as Gambia, Ivory Coast, Congo, Nigeria, Kenya,
Cameroon, Barbados, Guatemala and Italy have found refuge here. Nikki
Tesfai, founder of both the resource center and the shelter, is
herself an abused refugee. A 47-year-old Eritrean whose eyes hint at
an inner strength, Tesfai started the resource center in 1984. From
an office on Vermont Avenue near Fifth Street, the center offers
resettlement assistance, family support and counseling, job
placement, education, youth support groups and English-language
training to refugees from countries in Africa as well as from the
Middle East, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central America.</LD>
<TE>   Tesfai was raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the oldest of eight
children in a middle-class family. Her father sent her to school in
Switzerland where she earned a scholarship to study economics and
public policy. Later, a scholarship enabled her to continue her
studies at Union College in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974 Tesfai returned to Africa to join the Eritrean rebels
fighting for liberation. When she spoke up for women's rights,
however, the rebel leaders put her into a prison camp. Two and a half
years later, she escaped and trekked across the desert for four days
with a friend to Khartoum, Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   She found work with an agency of the United Nations and the job
brought her to Italy, where she married a fellow Eritrean refugee.
The couple moved to Texas and started a family. But her husband
became controlling. "He wouldn't let me have friends; he criticized
everything I said," she says. When his verbal abuse escalated into
physical abuse, she fled with her two young sons to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Here she discovered that the county's refugee centers catered
mainly to Latinos and Asians and lacked the staff to handle clients
who spoke African languages (about 550,000 African refugees and
immigrants live in L.A. County). With help from city Supervisor
Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, Tesfai opened the resource center. It runs
on federal, state and local government funds as well as private
donations.</TE>
<TE>   At the center, Tesfai soon realized that there was a need for a
shelter for refugee victims of domestic violence. "The African women
came to us for help in learning English, getting their papers, and
finding jobs," she recalls. "When we interviewed them, we learned
that they led abused lives. We didn't tell them to leave their
husbands, but we explained that in this country women do not have to
tolerate spousal abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Tesfai estimates that more than 75% of refugee women suffer from
domestic violence. One reason, she believes, is because they adapt to
American life more readily than their husbands. The men then take out
their frustration on their wives and children. "The women are eager
to learn English, to get a job. They are naturally more open to
change," she says. "Many men become hostile in the face of change. In
my experience, it takes men 10 times longer to adapt to a new
environment than women."</TE>
<TE>   Tesfai takes pride that since Refugee Safe Haven opened, with the
help of a $659,000 grant from the city of Los Angeles, 22 residents
have completed the six- to nine-month program and have gone on to
find jobs and to get their own apartments. At the moment, the 20-bed
facility houses residents from the Congo, Egypt, Gambia, Guatemala
and Los Angeles, most in their 20s and 30s, with six children among
them, ranging from an infant to an 11-year-old. They share household
and kitchen duties, and they take turns making dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't believe the variety of delicious ethnic foods that
are served here," says Tesfai. "The clients share their different
cultures."</TE>
<TE>   In the dining/multipurpose room is a sewing machine. There are
also several computers, but only two are in working condition. A TV,
VCR and a piano dot the living room. Much of the furniture in the
spick-and-span house came from private donations--down to the books
in the bookcase and the painting over the fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   A key player in the success of the shelter is psychotherapist
Gerrie Rosen, the clinical director. Rosen spends five days a week
here doing group and one-on-one counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's challenging to counsel women whose cultures don't encourage
them to speak freely," says Rosen. "Sometimes we communicate best
when we're working together in the garden."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen and her staff, with the help of volunteer advocates and
lawyers, help the residents get IDs, any benefits they're entitled
to, and if necessary, restraining orders against spouses. Rosen
supervises four house managers who rotate shifts at the shelter, so
that someone is on duty around the clock to ensure residents' safety.
Three of the managers have been victims of domestic violence,
including Fadumo, a 30-something Somali. A war refugee who escaped
Somalia with her four children, Fadumo lived in a shelter when she
arrived in L.A. several years ago. "When I came, Refugee Safe Haven
didn't exist," she says. "I was the only African where I stayed and
it was very difficult to fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Among other tasks, the house manager sees that the residents do
their chores and helps them with daily living skills. Since Fadumo,
who declined to give her last name to protect her safety, speaks a
bit of Arabic and Swahili as well as Somali and English, she is also
helpful as a translator. She proudly holds up the domestic violence
victim's handbook published by the county, "It Shouldn't Hurt to Go
Home," which she is translating into Somali and Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "At the shelter, we teach the women self-esteem," says Fadumo, who
is studying to be a social worker. She also hopes to return to
Somalia and work for women's rights. "Many of our clients come from
countries where they were forced into arranged marriages, and they
have lived with abuse for years. Their culture allows their husbands
to dominate them in any way they wish. In this country, we teach the
women that they have rights."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, it is this difference in cultural attitude toward women
that is sparking problems for Tesfai in the African community. "Men
come to me and say, 'Nikki, you're breaking up families by taking
women into the shelter,'" she says. "But I feel I'm helping save the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, though, she can't think about that. She and Rosen
confer about where to get a child's car seat and a highchair. Next
week the shelter is taking in three more battered refugee women with
four children among them. Sighing, Tesfai says: "The government just
announced a 15% to 25% cut in the budget for Department of Health and
Social Services. What we really need is for someone with a big heart
to adopt the shelter."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Coston of Philadelphia was only 21 in 1847 when her husband,
Benjamin, an inventor for the Navy, unexpectedly died of pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   While they had shared an active social life in Washington, D.C.,
and she counted many prominent people as her friends, it was up to
Coston to support herself and their four small children. She wrote in
her autobiography, "Signal Success," that a woman like herself had to
be "ready to fight like a lioness, if need be, to put food in the
mouths of her children."</LD>
<LD>   Her efforts began when she found a notebook with her husband's
ideas for signal flares. His aim was to use them to communicate
ship-to-ship or ship-to-land. Coston liked the idea but when she got
the models he had created, she discovered that the signals didn't
work. That's when she decided to give it a try.</LD>
<TE>   At first she worked unsuccessfully with several chemists. Then
while watching a fireworks show, she realized that the signals might
be able to work using the technology of fireworks. She sought the
advice of experts in that field.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo! In 1859, just before the Civil War, she patented a system
of red, white and green "Pyrotechnic Night Signals." John Quincy
Adams, sixth president of the United States, witnessed her patent
application. The U.S. Navy bought the rights to the signals for
$20,000 and awarded her the contract to manufacture them. During the
war, when ships were in trouble or in heavy fog, they set off one of
her signals. So did people who were shipwrecked. She is credited with
saving the lives of many people.</TE>
<TE>   Coston gained a second U.S. patent in 1871, and also patented her
signals in England, France, Holland, Denmark, Italy and Sweden. She
sold the signals to navies, shippers and yacht clubs around the
world. She traveled widely, lived to be 68 and never remarried.</TE>

<HD>Fasts Don't Detoxify Body, Experts Say</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: Is it a good idea to fast occasionally to detoxify my body?</LD>
<LD>   A: There is no evidence that fasting removes any type of toxins
from your body. The digestive system does that very well all by
itself. The notion that stagnation and decay in the colon produce
toxins that poison the body is an ancient one, but one that was
discredited long ago, according to the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter.
Total fasting can result in an initial weight loss, but most of the
loss is fluid and is replaced when you resume eating.</LD>
<LD>   There is no harm in a 24-hour fast, but after that period, fasting
can cause fatigue, headaches, irritability, nausea, low blood
pressure and problems with heart rhythms.</LD>

<HD>Serious Net Use Is on  the Rise</HD>
<DH>Technology: The novelty is wearing off for most users, a
Pew center study finds. Complaints about spam are on the rise.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Americans are using the Internet at work and at home
for more serious purposes, as complaints about unwanted
e-mails--particularly pornographic messages--increase, a study of
Internet users found.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet is shifting from a "dazzling new thing" to a
purposeful tool, a study of 1,501 Internet users in March 2001 found.</LD>
<LD>   The findings for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project were
released Sunday on the Pew Research Center's Web site.</LD>
<TE>   The study found that the number of people who went online from
work rose to about 55 million from 43 million in a March 2000 study.
The Internet also allows more workers to telecommute, with 14% of the
respondents saying the technology lets them do more job-related work
from home.</TE>
<TE>   Internet users also said they are e-mailing family members more,
with 84% of respondents using the technology to keep in touch with
relatives. Half of those surveyed send electronic mail to family and
friends at least once a week, the study reported.</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet has gone from novelty to utility for many
Americans," said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew project. "They are
beginning to take it for granted, but they can't imagine life without
it."</TE>
<TE>   The number of Internet users who made online purchases rose 45% to
58 million people in 2001, as travel-service sales increased 59% and
online banking increased 79%.</TE>
<TE>   The time spent online has meant less television, shopping and
reading of newspapers, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   As e-mail use increases, 44% of users said unwanted e-mail, or
spam, is a problem. Most Internet users said they had received
unwanted e-mail with adult content, the research found.</TE>
<TE>   Users did moderate their time online somewhat in 2001, the study
found. The average online session fell to 83 minutes from 90 minutes
in 2000, as some find the Internet less appealing and others said
they have less time to browse.</TE>
<TE>   The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
3percentage points, with larger margins for subgroups.</TE>

<LD>A team of scientists trying to understand a bombardment of space
debris that resurfaced the Earth 3.9 billion years ago suggests that
the cataclysmic event was caused by asteroids and not by comets.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have been trying to determine what caused the event,
which was far more violent than the upheavals that contributed to the
demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The earlier occurrence
left Earth marred by tens of thousands of impact craters and scarred
Mercury, Venus, the moon and Mars with thousands of craters. The
objects that created the craters left almost no trace, so it has been
difficult to determine what they were.</LD>
<LD>   A new analysis of chemical traces left on samples of cratered moon
rock suggests that the objects were stony and more like asteroids,
not carbon-rich objects like comets, said Barbara Cohen, a planetary
scientist at the University of Hawaii. It's possible, she said, that
a large asteroid broke up in the asteroid belt and showered the inner
solar system with debris.</LD>

<HD>A Powerful Attraction</HD>
<DH>Spacecraft studying the magnetic field surrounding Jupiter
send back a wealth of data on the solar system's largest object.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty times larger than the sun, tens of thousands of times larger
than Earth, the largest object in the solar system is a violent,
radiation-filled magnetic bubble that surrounds Jupiter, according to
new data resulting from the timely rendezvous of two spacecraft
around the giant planet.</LD>
<LD>   "This inner region is probably the most intense and hazardous
environment in the solar system except for the surface of the sun.
It's the extreme of the extreme," said Scott Bolton, a space
physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked on several of
the new studies.</LD>
<LD>   Jupiter's magnetic field arises from electric currents generated
by the planet's metallic interior. Earth has a magnetic field too,
but it is much smaller and simpler than Jupiter's. Both
magnetospheres contract and expand dramatically as they are buffeted
by the solar wind, the streams of charged particles that are hurled
into space by the ferocious activity of the sun.</LD>
<TE>   But the vagaries of Jupiter's magnetosphere have remained a
mystery. Many of the signals it generates are trapped; those that do
escape can't penetrate Earth's protective atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to measure these [charged particles and radio
signals] is to take your radio receiver to the planet," said William
Kurth, a planetary scientist at the University of Iowa who worked on
a number of the new studies.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, scientists were able to tag-team Jupiter with two
spacecraft: the soon to be retired veteran Galileo and a newcomer
called Cassini-Huygens. Cassini, speeding toward a 2004 date with
Saturn, passed within 6 million miles of Jupiter in order to use the
planet's gravitational field as a slingshot.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the two spacecraft, scientists were also able to
employ the Hubble and Chandra space telescopes and an array of radio
telescopes on Earth. The synchronized view gave scientists so much
information they published a flood of results. In the current issue
of the journal Nature, 82 planetary scientists have published seven
papers, something physicist Michele Dougherty of Imperial College in
London called "a very rich scientific harvest."</TE>
<TE>   Cassini reached Jupiter while the battered, radiation-soaked
Galileo was still circling the planet. Launched in 1989, Galileo had
been expected to give out by 1997, the year Cassini was launched.
With some software reboots and a little baby-sitting by JPL
engineers, Galileo kept plugging away and sending home streams of
data on Jupiter and its moons. "It just kept going, and going and
going," said Linda Spilker, the deputy project scientist at JPL for
Cassini.</TE>
<TE>   Galileo's extended lifespan gave scientists the unprecedented
chance to examine another planet using two spacecraft at once,
something Kurth called "an amazing stroke of luck."</TE>
<TE>   This gave scientists the opportunity to see just how much
Jupiter's magnetosphere is affected by the solar wind and how much of
it is altered by internal factors coming from Jupiter or its many
moons.</TE>
<TE>   While one spacecraft measured the magnetosphere, the other
measured the solar wind. "For the first time, we could see the
connection," said Spilker.</TE>
<TE>   The magnetosphere cooperated as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Nature chose to be kind on this occasion," said Thomas W. Hill,
an expert on planetary magnetospheres at Rice University in Houston.
"The magnetosphere was unusually large--just large enough to reach
out and touch the passing Cassini-Huygens spacecraft on two brief
occasions."</TE>
<TE>   The papers show that Jupiter's magnetosphere is indeed buffeted,
squashed and stretched by the solar wind, and that the bubble is also
influenced by strange dynamics that come from Jupiter and its moons.</TE>
<TE>   Much understanding came from studying the auroras at Jupiter's
poles. Like the northern and southern lights on Earth, the glowing
displays are visible manifestations of the magnetic energy
surrounding a planet. The new results show that Jupiter's auroras,
unlike Earth's, move around as Jupiter spins. They are even
influenced by Jupiter's moons. Electrical signals from the moons
travel across currents to Jupiter, leaving glowing traces or
"magnetic footprints" within the aurora.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unprecedented examination of Jupiter, the planet's
magnetosphere continues to hold its mysteries.</TE>
<TE>   One surfaced when Bolton was able to use Cassini's communication
antenna to "listen in" on radio signals coming from the violent, high
energy environment near Jupiter's surface. He found that some
electrons there were moving at nearly the speed of light--more than
twice as fast as expected. The findings suggest that activity around
Jupiter approaches the intensity of that found in some of the
universe's most violent regions: black holes and areas where stars
are forming. Another team was stumped by a "pulsating hot spot of
X-rays" coming from Jupiter's polar regions. They say they have no
idea of its source.</TE>
<TE>   Although scientists will be studying the new data for years, the
two spacecraft have moved on. Galileo is continuing to study Jupiter
and its moons and will do so until its planned descent into Jupiter's
crushing atmosphere next year. Cassini is speeding toward Saturn and
its rings. The gravity assist from Jupiter boosted Cassini's speed by
4,900 mph; the success at the giant planet boosted the sprits of its
scientific team.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jupiter fly-by," said Spilker, "gave us a taste of what we
can expect at Saturn."</TE>

<LD>One of my students told me he was writing a paper about the efforts
of the United States to maintain neutrality during World War I.</LD>
<LD>   And I thought: Right. As if anything can remain neutral in our
universe for long.</LD>
<LD>   Strange to say, but the universe does not run well in neutral.
Most of the time, the only way to stay in place is to keep moving.
The status quo needs constant tending. Doing nothing is not an
option--or perhaps I should say: Nothing doing!</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Take something really simple. Say you are sitting on a chair,
reading this column, thinking there is not much going on (physically
speaking), assuming that it doesn't require an exertion of force to
stay put. You would of course be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   If the ground beneath you weren't pushing back on your bottom with
a force equal to that with which your bottom pushes on the Earth,
you'd fall right through. In fact, gravity would cause the entire
Earth to collapse if it weren't for the constant shoving of electrons
in atoms, elbowing each other out of the way, creating a permanent
pressure that counters the relentless pull of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   It's often the way: Scratch the surface and "neutrality" becomes
nothing but a cover for a sometimes precarious balance of opposing
forces. As you sit on your chair, you don't think of yourself (or
even the chair) as electrically charged. But you're electrically
neutral only because the positively and negatively charged particles
in your body balance each other out. If you were to pull them apart,
the electricity in your body could power a good-sized city.</TE>
<TE>   Or forget sitting, and stand up. What does it take to stand still?
An enormous amount of continuous feedback from your brain to the
balance sensors in your ears to the muscles in your legs simply to
keep you from falling over. (Anyone who has ever tried to maintain a
"neutral spine" while standing or doing exercise knows how hard this
can be.)</TE>
<TE>   Even then, you can't ever really stand (or for that matter lie)
still. You're moving with the surface of a spinning Earth, which in
turn is orbiting the sun, which in turn is strolling around the Milky
Way and so on and so forth. There is no standing still in our
universe. You are always in motion relative to something, whether you
can sense it or not.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Einstein's equations describing gravity revealed--to
everyone's surprise--that the universe couldn't remain static even if
it wanted to. It has to expand or contract. Currently, it seems
delicately balanced between the collapsing and expanding, and
cosmologists would like to know why.</TE>
<TE>   Even nothing itself isn't neutral. The vacuum of empty space
jitters with continual uncertainty; particles of matter are coming
into existence all the time, exactly balanced by an equal number of
particles of antimatter; indeed, this energy of emptiness may well
account for most of the energy in the universe--even though in terms
of matter, it adds up to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists know that it's a lot easier to "neutralize" a problem
than to eliminate it completely. For example, astronomers would see
the stars a lot more clearly if they could eliminate distortions
caused by turbulence in the air--in effect, take the twinkle out of
starlight. But it's hard to get the atmosphere to stand still, so
instead, a technique called "adaptive optics" keeps track of the
wiggles in the atmosphere, then exactly counters the wiggles to make
them go away. It's like adding minus one to one to make zero.
Thousands of times per second.</TE>
<TE>   At some level, even smart politicians know there's no such thing
as neutrality. That's why we have checks and balances built into
democracy, economic policies and international agreements, so that
everything has a way of pushing back on everything else. It's a lot
of work maintaining stable balance, but really, there's no
alternative. Equilibrium is always dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In biological systems, neutrality is death. An organism that
doesn't constantly put energy to use fighting disintegration dies.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics guarantees it. Disorder is the
natural order of things and if you don't battle it constantly, things
fall apart. Shoelaces come untied. Rooms get messy. Teeth decay.
Waists spread. Food rots. Tires wear. Everything from schools to
relationships deteriorates.</TE>
<TE>   Even mountains, sooner or later, get worn down, and if the energy
of radioactive decay didn't continually work to uplift them, the
whole Earth would be flat.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing disorder (quantified as entropy) is what makes the
arrow of time point only one way; it's a phenomenon so familiar that
everyone understands intuitively that the universe can't run in
reverse.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that it doesn't run in
neutral either.</TE>

<BD>Bruce Fuller is a professor of education and public
policy at UC Berkeley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Washington fix the American family? President Bush seems to think
so, given his welfare reform message last week.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's proposals are rich in moral symbols--extolling the virtues
of hard work, marriage and abstinence--but impoverished in sound
policy ideas that are likely to work.</LD>
<LD>   Kicking off congressional debate over how to improve the landmark
1996 welfare reforms, Bush set a surprisingly divisive tone, seeming
to blame poor mothers for their fate and threatening to take social
engineering to new heights.</LD>
<TE>   Tough love, the president believes, should get even tougher for
single mothers, who make up 95% of adult welfare participants.</TE>
<TE>   Bush would more than double the number who must work, from about
one-third to 70% by 2007. And these mothers, a majority of whom have
preschool-age children at home, would be required to work 40 hours
each week, up from 30 hours.</TE>
<TE>   While praising the "heroic work" of single mothers, Bush asked for
$300 million for federal experiments aimed at "encouraging healthy,
stable marriages" and discouraging sex out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, apparently, has discovered a way to regulate
the right kind of romance.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare reform indeed has demonstrated how the gears of
government, often viewed as sluggish and ineffectual, can be
energized with clear moral messages: Get a job, get off welfare,
become self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   This has shaken the employment behavior of many women. The number
of families on welfare has gone from 5 million in 1994 to just 2.1
million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush now seems to believe that Washington should up the ante,
pushing deeper to re-engineer women's private lives. He and his
advisors appear not to have learned these lessons from earlier,
ill-fated liberal attempts at social engineering:</TE>
<TE>   * Rules without resources rarely work. Bush's new work rules would
require 500,000 more women to move into jobs each year. To do this,
most of them would require full-time child care support. But Bush has
proposed no increase in Head Start spending and hopes to cut federal
child care spending after adjusting for inflation. Where will these
mothers leave their infants and toddlers? And while Bush's new work
requirements would be costly to states and counties, which would have
to hire more staff to help place women in jobs, he opposes even an
inflation increase for local programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Low-wage jobs for mothers don't necessarily improve children's
lives. The president's own welfare director, Wade F. Horn, has said
that he is more concerned with children's well-being. Horn
understands that family poverty will not diminish until children's
daily settings improve. And this requires improved training for women
to push wages upward and increased child care aid.</TE>
<TE>   * Social engineering leads to unanticipated consequences. The
rising employment rate of poor women has done little to raise
marriage rates or lower birthrates. Findings due out in April from a
UC Berkeley-Yale research team show that Connecticut's welfare
reforms actually lowered the marriage rate for women with young
children. As their incomes climbed, these mothers saw less need for
husbands.</TE>
<TE>   Another unanticipated effect speaks to mothers of teenagers, who
now work in the afternoons when their teenagers get out of school.
Evaluations from four states reveal that these adolescents achieve
less in school and drink and smoke more compared with children of
women who face little pressure to work.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota requires some mothers to work just part-time, with case
workers providing intensive support with child care and health
services. The result has been discernible gains in children's early
development, an effect that few other work-first programs have shown.</TE>
<TE>   All parents yearn for stronger supports and basic security, from
affordable child care to better schools to safer neighborhoods. But
the president should not ask poor families to live on moral symbols
alone. If Congress swallows such half-baked policies, we will
squander an opportunity to truly strengthen family supports and
further reduce child poverty.</TE>

<BD>Dale Koscielny lives in Placentia.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I do not blame Andrea Yates. Although I don't purport to understand
all the pressures she felt, I do know what it feels like to believe
that you are a bad mother.</LD>
<LD>   There was a time in my life that I, too, believed I was a bad
mother to my four children. As a young 20-something, I married. I
wanted nothing more than to please God and my husband, not
necessarily in that order.</LD>
<LD>   We joined a small church: Jesus was preached, God was glorified,
pastor and wife modeled familial propriety and righteousness. I left
my job and rose to a higher calling: Christian mother.</LD>
<TE>   One baby came, then two, then three, then four. Blessed rewards! I
kneaded and baked bread; soaked and simmered refried beans; blended
mayonnaise from oil and egg with just a dash of dried mustard;
purchased flats of half-rotten strawberries and plucked stems, pared
away soft spots, mashed, mixed, boiled and "put up" jar after jar of
strawberry preserves, with my toddlers at my elbow.</TE>
<TE>   We--my husband and I--were "in" but not "of" a materialistic
world, covenanted before God to thrive on one income, to share one
car.</TE>
<TE>   After my children's bedtime, I sewed their T-shirts and shorts on
my trusty Singer and embroidered pillowcases for each newly married
couple at church.</TE>
<TE>   Not a very accomplished seamstress, what I lacked in skill I made
up for in enthusiasm. I hunted for bargains; a close-out fabric sale
netted six home-sewn brown-and-white plaid two-way stretch swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In my "spare" time, I weeded dichondra, jogged with the dog,
hauled laundry to the Laundromat and staggered under the weight of
dozens of children's library books: Bible stories at breakfast,
nursery rhymes on the potty, fairy tales at nap time.</TE>
<TE>   I know how clever Andrea Yates needed to be to keep her five
babies clean and fed and amused and enriched and refined--manners, of
course, were learned at home. Housecleaning was a given. No nannies
or Merry Maids for us. We are the Proverbs 31 ladies of the Bible, up
before dawn, seeing to the ways of our household.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of feeling fulfilled, following 15 years of never
"getting it right," I felt frustrated: four shabbily dressed siblings
bickered, tract-home paint peeled off finger-printed walls, the
ceiling lining in the car drooped and the dichondra lawn resembled a
wasteland.</TE>
<TE>   I rebelled. I reincorporated four-letter words into my educated
vocabulary. I returned part-time to my profession. I scrimped to
purchase a "pre-owned" Volkswagen Rabbit. I hired a cleaning lady,
enrolled in ballet classes at the local college and resumed reading
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   I had awakened to the impossibility of my own expectations. I did
not dump my faith, just switched churches. However, throughout my
epiphany and ensuing choices, I had the luxury of not being mentally
ill or suffering postpartum depression. I was just very, very
angry--at myself for trying to live someone else's definition of
Christian mother, at my husband for being a bystander and at our
church for not providing praise, offering grace or permitting
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   I believe there is a part of Christianity, squeezed out from
between lines not written in the Bible, which plants the onus of
family welfare on the wife-mother, minus the support system of the
extended family available 50 or 100 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates and I had the silent self-incriminating definitions
for "Christian mother" rushing around inside our heads with no one to
refute them or to excuse us from unsurmountable tasks daily set
before us by our own unattainable standards.</TE>
<TE>   A woman's world can be impossible. We muddle on until we break
away from our faith or break up our marriage, or just plain break.</TE>

<HD>February Car Sales Exceed Expectations</HD>
<DH>Autos: Figures provide a further indication that the U.S.
is emerging from recession. GM, which had expected a 10% sales
drop-off, posts minor gain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM BROWN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S. sales of new cars and light trucks fell about 3.5% in February
from strong levels a year ago, but the results were far better than
expected and prompted analysts to say the auto industry may have
weathered the worst of a short-lived U.S. recession.</LD>
<LD>   Underscoring a stronger industry sales outlook and a widely shared
belief that the United States is back on the road to recovery, Ford
Motor Co. said it was setting its second-quarter North American
production estimate at 1.18 million vehicles, an increase of 4%, or
50,000 vehicles, over the same quarter last year.</LD>
<LD>   The boost in output matched one announced this week by General
Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker and one of the biggest
upside surprises in Friday's sales results.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts had expected GM, which was alone among Detroit's Big
Three auto makers in booking a profit last year, to report a drop of
as much as 10% in its February sales. But GM, which launched a new
customer incentives program as part of Detroit's ongoing price wars
Friday, said February sales rose 0.4%, as strong demand for its
pickups and sport-utility vehicles offset a drop in car sales.</TE>
<TE>   GM also said Chevrolets were outselling Fords for the first time
since July 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into 2002, some analysts had feared that U.S. light
vehicle sales could drop to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of as
low as 15.2 million vehicles in February from a unusually robust rate
of 17.5 million in the same month last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those forecasts were later revised upward to the range of
January's 15.8 million sales rate. But excluding results from Isuzu
Motors Ltd., February sales ran at an actual rate of 16.6 million
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, the world's No. 2 car maker, said its sales last month
dropped 13.5%, excluding import brands. While admitting it was "not a
gold medal month for Ford," George Pipas, the company's chief sales
analyst, said he had earlier expected sales to drop as much as 20%
from February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At the Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler AG , February sales fell
11%, less than the lower end of some forecasts. Gary Dilts,
Chrysler's sales chief, said the first two weeks of February were
slow but sales picked up markedly in the final half of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Despite generally good news from Detroit, foreign auto makers were
likely to continue gaining share in the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Co. said February U.S. sales were up 1.7% and Nissan
Motor Co. Ltd. said sales rose 8.8%. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
Ltd., touted as one of the global auto industry's undisputed success
stories this year, said U.S. sales rose 15%. Mitsubishi Motor Corp.
said sales rose 31%.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors also said Friday is would bring back no-interest
loans on some models as an alternative to as much as $2,002 cash
back, while Ford and Chrysler responded by extending incentives to
compete for sales.</TE>
<TE>   The latest plan from General Motors, which began no-interest loans
in September and switched to cash rebates in January, runs through
this month. Ford on Tuesday will extend through April 8 its rebates
of up to $2,500 or zero-percent financing. Chrysler through March is
continuing cash back of as much as $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, General Motors shares rose $1.99,
to $54.97 while Ford gained 76 cents, to $15.64. The U.S. shares of
Stuttgart, Germany-based DaimlerChrysler increased $1.62, to $41.50.</TE>

<HD>Marathon Confirms It Plans Baja Facility</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Eyeing an attractive market for gas and electricity in California and
northwest Mexico, Marathon Oil Co. formally joined the ranks of major
energy companies seeking to build natural gas installations in Baja
California.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting with Wall Street securities analysts last week, the
Houston-based concern confirmed a Times report that it had secured a
site in Playas de Tijuana south of the U.S.-Mexico border. Its
complex would include a liquid natural gas terminal, regasification
and storage facilities, a pipeline to U.S. and Mexican markets, and a
400-megawatt electric power plant.</LD>
<LD>   The company did not specify the total amount to be invested or the
precise location, but sources involved in the deal said it is on the
waterfront 15 miles south of the border, amid heavily populated
residential areas favored by Tijuanans and U.S. visitors for weekend
getaways.</LD>
<TE>   Marathon's partners include Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned
energy company. Pertamina is the world's largest producer of liquid
natural gas and would become the project's major supplier if built.
Pertamina has aggressively sought to expand its liquid natural gas
reach beyond the glutted Pacific Rim region.</TE>
<TE>   In late January, Baja California Gov. Eugenio Elorduy Walther told
The Times that Royal Dutch/Shell also had acquired rights to
oceanfront property about 60 miles south of the border for a liquid
natural gas terminal. Shell has so far declined to comment on the
project, reportedly to be located south of the Bajamar golf resort.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sempra Energy of San Diego and El Paso Corp. of Houston
each unveiled proposals to build waterfront liquid natural gas
facilities to meet the expanding regional demand for fuel to operate
a host of new natural gas-fired electric power plants planned or
under construction in Mexico and California.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government has yet to approve any of the proposals,
which face stiff opposition from local residents. Aiming to gain
local favor, Marathon said its proposal could include a waste-water
treatment facility and a water desalination plant to help with
pressing local infrastructure needs.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid a stubborn recession in the semiconductor industry,
communications chip maker Conexant Systems Inc. took a dose of harsh
medicine and is mounting a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   With industrywide sales plummeting 30% last year and its own
losses totaling $1.9 billion over the last two years, Conexant shook
off the lethargy of its staid past, moving most manufacturing
overseas, firing nearly 25% of its work force and replacing its
all-things-to-all-people strategy with a new plan to break the
company into separate, better-focused pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Conexant's original plan was to split into three independent
companies, focusing on chips for commercial Internet equipment, cell
phones and computer modems. Last week, it disclosed a fourth spinoff
that will handle high-end chip manufacturing.</LD>
<TE>   The company's remaining specialty manufacturing plant at Conexant
headquarters in Newport Beach will be sold to Carlyle Group Inc. as a
joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington buyout firm will own 55% of the operation, which
Conexant executives will manage.</TE>
<TE>   After months of decline, Conexant's financial picture has begun to
brighten. Its revenue has grown in the last two quarters since its
low of $200million in the April-to-June period. The company pulled in
$230million last quarter. Conexant's quarterly losses also have begun
to shrink, from $745million in June to $205million in the quarter
that ended in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the company is doing everything right," said Kalpesh
Kapadia, senior analyst at C.E. Unterberg Towbin in San Francisco.
"The numbers are improving across the board."</TE>
<TE>   The company still faces daunting odds in an extremely competitive
industry dominated in fast-growing markets by heavyweights Intel
Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., and Broadcom Corp. in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said Conexant's efforts over the last year have
positioned it to move forward when demand returns for its vast array
of communications semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   A key part of the company's strategy is developing new chips for
cell phones, high-speed modems and television set-top
boxes--still-growing markets that offset the company's lagging
business in networking chips for Internet routers and switches.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone makers, particularly major customer Samsung Electronics
Ltd., already are buying an expanded range of Conexant chips, giving
the Orange County company a bigger share of the wireless market. And
new chips for high-speed access, or broadband, will enable cheaper
access through computers, televisions and other so-called smart
electronics.</TE>
<TE>   After sales hit bottom in June, revenue for the company's wireless
unit grew 41% last quarter from the previous three months. Sales for
its broadband unit increased 8%.</TE>
<TE>   The one sour note for the company is its once-soaring business for
commercial-grade Internet switches and routers. The division's
revenue fell to $14.2million last quarter from a peak of $180million
in the quarter ended September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant Chairman and Chief Executive Dwight W. Decker said sales
in all three divisions will be flat or up slightly for the first
three months of this year, a quarter in which industrywide sales are
expected to drop 10%.</TE>
<TE>   As a sign of the company's resolve to turn around its fortunes,
Decker and 75 top managers took a 10% pay cut last year and won't
receive raises until the company posts two straight quarters of
profit.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing that helps us keep our minds on the matters at
hand," Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   If sales for Conexant continue to grow and the company returns to
profitability this year, as Decker predicts, it would be quite a
turnaround for a company that ran low on cash last year and still is
shaking off an image as slow-footed and unfocused.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Company's Stock Is Lagging</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock had soared to more than $124 a share in 1999
through mid-2000. But when the tech downturn struck in earnest in
late 2000, Conexant's stock plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the upturn in operations, Decker is frustrated that the
stock continues to lag behind others in the industry on average,
analysts said. On Friday it rose 73 cents to $10.97 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said that even though Conexant is on the rebound,
Wall Street wants to see whether it can sustain its recent
performance, which beat projected goals.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, "executives had created a set of expectations among
investors that they could not meet," said Charles Boucher of Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. "The company had a significant amount of losses and
fell short in the markets it wanted to grow."</TE>
<TE>   A big part of Conexant's struggles stems from its past as a part
of former aerospace and defense contractor Rockwell International
Corp., which spun off its chip-making unit in December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Rockwell had become a conglomerate able to serve the
wide-ranging needs of its military and aerospace customers, Conexant
wanted to make all kinds of communication chips for the civilian and
government markets.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's communications, it's Conexant. We wanted to get that
message into people's minds," said Decker, who ran the division when
it was part of Rockwell.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, modem chips for personal computers and fax machines
were the company's bread and butter, accounting for half its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The business was a cash cow that gave Conexant the money to
develop high-speed modem, wireless and Internet chips, said analyst
Mark Lipacis of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The broad range of products and the manufacturing operation,
though, became the company's Achilles' heel.</TE>
<TE>   The wireless, broadband and Internet equipment businesses did not
mesh, and manufacturing facilities had been costly: Conexant has more
than twice the employees of Broadcom, yet it rang up only 10% more
sales--$1.1 billion--last year.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant executives realized they were spread too thin, Decker
said. Salespeople were pulled in different directions, trying to meet
seasonal demands and deadlines of computer makers such as Compaq
Computer Corp. and big networking companies such as Cisco Systems
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, executives began to see the units as increasingly
complex and different, Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   "In wireless, for instance, we want very low-power chips. In
Internet [equipment], we want speed and care less about power."</TE>
<TE>   So in late 2000, the company said it would spin off its
then-fast-growing Internet equipment chip maker, Mindspeed
Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the spinoff couldn't have been worse. Not only was
Conexant going into a tailspin, but the entire industry was falling
into its most disastrous period.</TE>
<TE>   Overly optimistic manufacturing and sales in 1999 and 2000, coming
as the explosion in Internet companies fizzled, created a glut of
chips on the market.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drastic Changes Reduce Company's Costs</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Conexant and others in the industry, sales of cell
phones and personal computers picked up by mid-year, but Internet
equipment makers are still working off inventory. Conexant put
Mindspeed's spinoff on hold, probably until late this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, managers had much more work to do to right the company.
Maintaining its manufacturing operations and a high level of research
soaked up fistfuls of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In a six-month period last year, the company sent most
manufacturing overseas, fired nearly 2,000 of its 8,800 employees,
cut overall costs by one-third, reduced spending and raised available
cash to $436 million by the end of December. As many as 200 more
employees are being let go this quarter, and 650 others will be
leaving to work at the manufacturing spinoff.</TE>
<TE>   By July, small emergency orders for both modem and cell phone
chips began trickling in, giving Conexant executives hope that
customers had worked through much of their surplus. Early this year,
Mindspeed finally saw orders pick up, Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Conexant said it will spin off its wireless unit,
probably in May or June, and merge it with Alpha Industries Inc. in
Woburn, Mass., to create the largest maker of complete chip sets for
mobile communications.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the new company will pay Conexant $150 million for a
plant in Mexicali, Mexico. Separately, Conexant is picking up another
$150 million in cash from a deposit being returned by a foundry
partner. Both deals will boost Conexant's once-shaky cash situation.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that once the wireless and Mindspeed divisions are
spun off, the remaining Conexant business still will have a solid
business in chips for high-speed modems and set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "When Conexant is split up into separate companies focused on key
areas, ultimately each will be more successful," said analyst F.
Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond, Va. He estimates the
units are worth a total of as much as $21 a share, a price Conexant's
stock hasn't hit in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   But even now, he said, "it's so much better a business today in
terms of financial health than it was a year ago."</TE>

<HD>Access to Corporate Credit in Question</HD>
<DH>Finance: As the economy recovers, experts debate whether
companies have enough access to money to finance growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As signs of economic recovery increase, a key question is whether
businesses have access to enough credit to finance growth. It's an
issue of surprisingly intense debate.</LD>
<LD>   On one side, some analysts contend that banks, skittish after the
blow-ups of Enron Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and other major
borrowers, are denying loans to worthy companies, as they did a
decade ago in a credit crunch that helped keep U.S. growth stunted in
1991 and '92.</LD>
<LD>   "Small-business borrowers are paying for the sins" of large,
troubled firms, especially those in the telecom sector, said John
Rutledge, an economist who heads a Greenwich, Conn., buyout firm.</LD>
<TE>   In a stinging report last week for the National Assn. of
Manufacturers, Rutledge described a two-tier economic recovery, with
giant firms still able to borrow at decent rates via bond offerings,
while many smaller companies, dependent on banks for expansion
capital, endure higher interest rates, special fees and outright
denial of access to credit.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey last month, 34% of the manufacturing group's members
said credit was tighter than a year ago, and 26% said that was
restricting their expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Association President Jerry Jasinowski urged banks to "not
strangle the economic recovery in its cradle."</TE>
<TE>   For the overall economy, however, the picture appears far
brighter. Counting three major sources of credit--bank loans,
short-term notes known as commercial paper and long-term bonds--U.S.
businesses have had substantially more access to credit during this
economic downturn than in the last three recessions, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. reported last month.</TE>
<TE>   Many smaller businesses, particularly in non-manufacturing
sectors, said they have no funding worries. A January survey by the
National Federation of Independent Business found plenty of firms
talking of expansion, with bank loan rates averaging a low 7.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Credit availability was cited as the "most important" issue by 2%
of the federation's 600,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tons of money available," said William C. Dunkelberg,
chief economist for the group, in which manufacturers make up only
about 10% of the members. Dunkelberg's index of small-business
optimism rose from 100.4 in December to 103.5 in January--the highest
reading since the first quarter of 2000, when economic growth still
was strong.</TE>
<TE>   To measure businesses' access to credit, analysts focus on three
major sources of money. Here's a look at the trends in each credit
sector:</TE>
<TE>   * Bank loans. In a report last week, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said banks' commercial and industrial lending fell nearly 10%
last year, a decline greater than in the recession of 1990-91.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that drop unquestionably reflected banks' reluctance to
extend credit to some borrowers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But the slide in commercial and industrial loans outstanding also
was tied to many companies' decisions to cut back on borrowing as
they pared expansion plans and liquidated inventories amid the weak
economy.</TE>
<TE>   However, in recent weeks the volume of commercial and industrial
lending has increased again, Fed data show.</TE>
<TE>   * Commercial paper. Many major companies use the commercial paper
market--short-term notes--for routine financing. The volume of
commercial paper outstanding from nonfinancial companies has plunged
34%, or about $100 billion, over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   As with bank loans, some of the decline in commercial paper
reflected companies' decisions to shift to longer-term financing as
interest rates fell.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor, however, was investors' worries about rising
corporate failures. The high-profile bankruptcies of Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. and Enron, companies once regarded as rock-solid,
spooked buyers of commercial paper and made them less willing to
extend credit to certain companies, because commercial paper is
unsecured debt.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, rumors of financial troubles have shut companies
including Tyco International and Qwest Communications out of the
commercial paper market.</TE>
<TE>   In such an environment, "you can have a perfectly good company
that can't roll over its paper," said Ray Kennedy, a portfolio
manager for Pimco bond funds in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   * Long-term bonds. While banks' business loans and companies'
issuance of commercial paper fell last year, long-term corporate bond
issuance rose.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, major firms continue to borrow in the bond market this
year. Last week, General Motors Corp. sold $3.3 billion of 30-year
bonds. Even struggling retailer Gap Inc. was able to sell $1.2
billion in seven-year notes last week.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms have opted to take advantage of lower interest rates to
lock in debt costs for the long haul, analysts said. And investors
have been willing to buy bonds because bond owners typically have the
strongest claims to company assets in the event of financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many bond issuers are paying more than usual to borrow. The
lowest-rated level of investment-grade corporate bonds historically
have paid about 2 percentage points more in yield than 10-year
Treasury bonds. But that spread reached 3.5 percentage points after
the Sept. 11 attacks, and it's still about 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on non-investment-grade bonds--junk debt--also have
remained high as junk bond defaults continue to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, Walter Einhorn, a former chairman of the Commercial
Finance Assn. who spent 25 years as a Mellon Bank executive, sees no
dearth of credit hobbling businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no credit crunch," said Einhorn, whose Sunrock Capital
Corp. in Philadelphia makes loans to stressed companies that pledge
equipment, inventories or unpaid accounts as collateral. "It's just
that [unwise] deals of the kind approved as standard five years ago
are no longer being approved" by banks and other lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Economy.com economist Mark Zandi agrees that credit isn't a
problem for many businesses. But he worries that a credit crunch
still could develop.</TE>
<TE>   His reasoning is that banks have put themselves in jeopardy by
lending so free-handedly to consumers, sharply boosting household
debt loads.</TE>
<TE>   Though consumer spending has been a bright spot in the weak
economy, consumer bankruptcies rose 20% last year to a record
1.4million filings.</TE>
<TE>   As bankers are forced to write off more bad consumer loans, the
lenders will come under more pressure by regulators and shareholders
to beef up reserves and make fewer loans to protect their own
strength, Zandi said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the recent rebound in banks' commercial and
industrial lending has encouraged analysts.</TE>
<TE>   One contributing factor in the rise appears to be that some
businesses shut out of the commercial paper market are turning back
to less-desirable bank loans, economists for several banks said.
However, they said other factors play a greater role in the upturn in
loans.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses typically use bank credit lines to finance increases in
inventory this time of year, preparing for higher sales at Easter,
said David Littmann, economist for Comerica Bank in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   But Littmann thinks the latest increase is more than just
seasonal: His survey of the south Michigan auto industry showed "a
huge shoot-up" in inventory rebuilding from January to February, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America Capital Markets economist Lynn Reaser, describing
"a swing from massive [business] inventory liquidation to ... perhaps
a moderate rebuilding," said the bottoming-out of commercial loans
"is a positive sign the recession is coming to a close."</TE>
<TE>   In his typically cautious way, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan suggested much the same thing Wednesday during
congressional testimony in which he acknowledged that more bankers
have made it tougher for businesses to borrow money.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said tighter credit is normal during tough times like
those the nation has been through. "Hopefully," he added, "if the
economy continues to show the signs that it has been exhibiting of
late, some of that pressure will be removed."</TE>

<LD>Alec Gores, the Los Angeles technology turnaround artist who hopes to
make a bid for Global Crossing Ltd. as early as this week, has never
tackled anything as big or complex as the company responsible for the
fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   His Gores Technology Group prefers to take control of troubled
divisions of large corporations, and his biggest deals to date
include buying Learning Co. from Mattel Inc. and the VeriFone unit of
Hewlett-Packard Co.</LD>
<LD>   But people who know Gores say he thrives on complex and difficult
business deals and delights in doing the unthinkable.</LD>
<TE>   Gores, who declined to be interviewed Sunday, told the Los Angeles
Business Journal in October, "I like tough things. I like things that
are just a mess, that nobody else can figure out. The messier, the
better."</TE>
<TE>   They don't get any messier than Global Crossing. The company's
operations are being overseen by a Bankruptcy Court branch in New
York, where an unhappy contingent of bankers, creditors and
shareholders--with the help of a judge--will decide whether to
embrace a restructuring plan or simply liquidate the company.</TE>
<TE>   The only substantive bid for Global Crossing so far has come from
a pair of Asian firms, which pledged to invest $750 million to gain a
79% stake in a reconstituted company. That plan has drawn fire from
nearly every contingent, so Gores Technology will at least have a
receptive audience in the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Gores (pronounced Gor-is) has earned high praise for taking
companies others deemed unfixable--sometimes at little or no
cost--and nursing them back to financial health. Mattel basically
gave its troubled children's educational software unit to Gores for a
cut of any future profit. Micron Technology gave Gores $70 million to
take its beleaguered personal computer unit off its hands.</TE>
<TE>   Gores, who turns 49 this month, has long understood the importance
of business basics. He is the oldest son of Greek entrepreneurs who
immigrated from Israel to Michigan more than 30 years ago. His father
helped run Frank's Westside Grocery, a store outside Flint that was
owned by his uncle. After studying computer science at Western
Michigan University and a short stint as a programmer for General
Motors Corp., he borrowed $10,000 from his father and launched a
minicomputer distribution business in his parents' basement.</TE>
<TE>   Gores sold the company in 1986 to Contel Corp., a local telephone
company, for $10 million. Then he watched in frustration as Contel
squandered his years of hard work, cutting commissions to salespeople
and letting a profitable business wither. Gores was so upset that he
tried to buy the company back. He was outbid, but the experience
pointed him to a career in corporate turnarounds.</TE>
<TE>   After starting out with a word-processor maker called CPT, Gores
Technology Group grew slowly, making only a smattering of deals until
a few years ago. It has since acquired more than 35 companies with
combined revenue of more than $2.5 billion. Some of the companies
have been sold at a gain; the rest are operating profitably or have
been shut down. The Los Angeles-based buyout firm still owns about 20
of the companies it has acquired.</TE>
<TE>   From a large black leather chair inside his minimalist offices on
Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood, Gores routinely juggles three phone
calls, scribbles on note pads, and drums out numbers on a small
solar-powered calculator.</TE>
<TE>   He is focused mostly on the big picture. His employees scout deals
by chatting up investment bankers and poring over newspapers and
magazines. Gores decides which opportunities to pursue, then sets the
rules of engagement and leaves the details to his underlings.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, he takes aim at businesses that generate lots of cash
so he can fund his turnarounds internally. He prefers to focus on
small divisions within large companies because they usually have fat
that is easy to cut. Most of his targets have been small, with annual
revenue between $5 million and $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Once he makes an acquisition, Gores relies on a team of legal and
accounting experts to find ways to cut costs. A team of 20 people or
so swoops into a newly acquired company and scrutinizes everything
from financial records and real estate leases to contracts with
suppliers. The team interviews employees and customers, asking how
the business can be improved.</TE>
<TE>   Their biggest success so far has been the Learning Co.</TE>
<TE>   Toy maker Mattel bought it in 1999 for $3.5 billion. Though it
boasted popular brands like Carmen Sandiego, Myst, Reader Rabbit and
Pokemon, the division lost $300 million in the year it was owned by
Mattel--nearly $1 million a day. The acquisition, considered one of
the worst in corporate history, cost Mattel Chief Executive Jill
Barad her job.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel was so desperate to unload Learning Co. that it gave the
division to Gores in exchange for 50% of future profit or the
proceeds from any sale of the company. Gores' operations team
consolidated business units and brands, cut hundreds of jobs, slashed
spending and won over distributors.</TE>
<TE>   The company stopped hemorrhaging cash within 75 days and made more
than $100 million in profit in its first year with Gores Technology,
according to the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Gores followed that success with two other high-profile deals. In
late April 2001, Micron Technology gave Gores its struggling PC unit,
Micron Electronics, along with $70million. Micron Technology, eager
to focus on its Web-hosting businesses, calculated the payment was
cheaper than the cost of shutting the division down. About a month
later, Gores took over Hewlett-Packard's VeriFone division for an
undisclosed price. VeriFone is a leading provider of electronic
payment systems for financial institutions and merchants. Both
VeriFone and Micron are profitable now.</TE>
<TE>   Gores likes to operate below the radar. But that is becoming
increasingly difficult as his successes mount and his appetite grows.
His indulgences include a giant house in Beverly Hills, a midnight
blue Mercedes CL55 AMG and suits by Italian designer Ermenegildo
Zegna.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother Tom Gores, may be an even bigger player in the
turnaround business. He heads Platinum Equity, a Los Angeles firm
that also specializes in high-tech buyouts. Platinum has taken on
divisions shed by Alcatel, Williams Communications Group and Racal
Electronics, and the brothers often compete for deals. Tom Gores, 36,
made his debut on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans this year,
his estimated $1.5 billion net worth ranking him at No. 293. Alec did
not make the list.</TE>
<TE>   Another younger brother, Sam Gores, owns a talent agency. All
three brothers live within a few blocks of each other and often
socialize together, according to people who know them. Alec Gores has
four children and is twice divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Gores told TheStreet.com last year that he wanted to raise his
game by taking over a publicly traded company. Global Crossing, which
went public in 1998 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization less than five years later, would seem to fit the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Gores knows that winning the bidding for Global Crossing--and then
fixing it--will be difficult. But long odds have yet to deter him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we do for a living," he told the Evening Standard of
London last year. "We practice it every day. It's like golf--the more
you play, the better you are going to get."</TE>

<HD>Loews Hotels to Pay $12,000 Fine to Settle Union Complaint</HD>
<DH>Labor: The charge that managers illegally checked
immigration papers stemmed from the suspension of a worker in Santa
Monica.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loews Hotels Holding Corp. has agreed to pay a $12,000 fine and
retrain all human resource managers in its chain to settle a
union-filed charge that managers illegally checked immigration
documents of employees.</LD>
<LD>   The case grew out of a complaint filed last summer with the
Department of Justice by an employee at the Loews Santa Monica Beach
Hotel. Eventually, it led to a review of employment forms kept by
hotels throughout the chain.</LD>
<LD>   The employee, Mario Guevara, was asked to show proof of legal
residency after his residency document, or green card, had expired.
Guevara said that he was still a permanent legal resident, even
though the document itself had expired, and should be allowed to
continue working. But the hotel suspended him for two days, until he
could produce new documents.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement includes a $60 payment to Guevara for lost wages.</TE>
<TE>   The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union, which is
attempting to organize workers at the Santa Monica hotel, helped
Guevara file the complaint. The union has since filed two other
complaints alleging improper document checking.</TE>
<TE>   Although employers are responsible for determining the legal
status of all hires, they cannot discriminate against applicants by
asking for excessive documentation or singling out certain groups,
such as immigrants. Guevara said that he was singled out because he
was an immigrant and that the expiration of a U.S. citizen's
passport, for example, would not have triggered a check.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice did not return calls seeking comment on
the settlement, which is to be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   Union representative Kurt Peterson said improper document checks
are common and often are used to intimidate workers, especially those
involved in union drives.</TE>
<TE>   "Our belief is this kind of careless verification occurs all the
time," Peterson said. "What infrequently happens is that people
actually stand up and say something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Loews spokeswoman Sara Harper conceded that the investigation by
the Justice Department's Office of Special Counsel had found numerous
instances in the files of improper checks of expired green cards. But
Harper added that the laws are complex and that turnover in hiring
departments can lead to mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've recently learned about the unusual aspects of the
[verification] process," she said. "These kinds of little nuances are
things that are probably easy to overlook."</TE>
<TE>   Harper said the hotel chain considers the settlement "fair,"
adding, "This guy is due his wages, and there's no problem with
that."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Employees of Lockheed Martin Corp. in Palmdale rejected the aerospace
company's three-year contract proposal Sunday and voted to strike.</LD>
<LD>   Of the about 1,000 International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers members who voted, 95% voted to strike, union spokesman Bob
Wood said. The workers in Palmdale represent about one-sixth of the
work force covered by the contract, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Results from other plants, including one in Marietta, Ga., were
expected late Sunday. If the workers at those plants also vote to
strike, workers would walk out starting at 12:01 a.m. March 11, Wood
said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin rose 66 cents to
$57.07 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 22%
this year.</TE>

<HD>Popular Latin Pollo Chain Heads to L.A.</HD>
<DH>Fast food: Retailer La Curacao enters deal with Central
American restaurant operator. Expansion is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each time any of his friends plan a visit to El Salvador, Henry Aguilar
places his to-go order.  They better bring him back some chicken or things
could get ugly.</LD>
<LD>   "Trajiste pollo?" he asks as soon as they return to Los Angeles.
"Did you bring chicken?" Everyone knows he's talking about Pollo
Campero, fried and rotisserie-style chicken with a loyal following
throughout Latin America, especially in El Salvador and Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the tastiest thing there can be. I used to walk to the
Pollo Campero [in El Salvador] and from three or four blocks away you
could [smell] the aromas. There's nothing like it. I can't describe
the flavor, but it's my passion."</LD>
<TE>   Owners of Los Angeles' La Curacao department store chain are
counting on the same feverish cravings for the marinated chicken as
they open the first Pollo Campero restaurant in the United States
later this month inside their Pico-Union district store.</TE>
<TE>   Adir Restaurants, a subsidiary of Adir Holding Co., which also
owns La Curacao, has purchased a franchisee license for Pollo Campero
restaurants from Pollo Campero International, the restaurant chain's
Guatemala City-based parent. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   By May the company plans to open restaurants inside the other La
Curacao stores in Huntington Park, South Gate and Panorama City under
a joint venture with Pollo Campero, said Jerry Azarkman, who controls
Adir Holding with his brother Ron Azarkman.</TE>
<TE>   La Curacao, catering almost exclusively to the Southland's Latino
immigrant communities, has tapped into an often-ignored and
misunderstood customer base to build a $100-million retail chain. The
stores offer credit to people with no credit history and operate a
type of export program that allows customers to purchase merchandise
for relatives in their home countries.</TE>
<TE>   Now, La Curacao is hoping to extend its relationship with the
region's Central Americans by importing what is arguably more than a
culinary brand name but a cultural phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   On every Los Angeles-bound flight from San Salvador and Guatemala
City, passengers carry Pollo Campero's trademark orange boxes filled
with chicken pieces like so much precious cargo to share with friends
and relatives. Pollo Campero estimates it sells more than 3 million
to-go orders annually through outlets at Aurora International Airport
in Guatemala City and San Salvador International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   News that a Pollo Campero restaurant will be opening in downtown
Los Angeles has La Curacao fielding hundreds of phone calls each day,
company spokesman Darrell Alatorre said. An ad in a local
Spanish-language publication to recruit employees for the first
restaurant brought in more than 900 applications, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pollo Campero means a lot to Central Americans and to the Mexican
community here. It's part of the culture," Azarkman said.
"The Campero phenomenon is very much more than food ... it's
emotional.  This is the kind of company we want to work with that can
bring a piece of their countries to [our customers]."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1971, Pollo Campero International, with $300 million in
annual revenue, has 150 locations spread throughout Mexico, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and
Ecuador that serve 75 million customers a year. To meet the demand of
patrons traveling between Latin America and the U.S., the restaurant
operator opened locations at the international airports in Guatemala
City and San Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   "Our airports send a lot of chicken to Los Angeles," said Roberto
Denegri, Pollo Campero's vice president. "Those planes, on any
flight, are full of chicken."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next five years, Adir Restaurants plans to begin
franchising Pollo Campero restaurants elsewhere in California,
throughout the Southwest and Pacific Northwest, Azarkman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said scouts are looking for real estate for
five stand-alone Pollo Campero restaurants the company plans to open
in Los Angeles by the end of the year, all in areas with heavy
concentrations of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Pollo Campero will encounter stiff competition from
well-established chicken eateries, said restaurant consultant Rob
Sandelman. The limited name awareness of Pollo Campero chicken may
help it in a highly targeted market, but a different strategy would
be necessary to extend the brand into the mainstream market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very competitive market," he said, pointing to fast-food
chains El Pollo Loco, Koo Koo Roo, Baja Fresh and Rubio's.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless they have a point of difference in variety or price to
their advantage, it's going to be difficult to generate interest,"
said Sandelman, president of Villa Park-based market research firm
Sandelman &amp; Associates. "Most people are not willing to drive too far
for a quick meal."</TE>
<TE>   El Pollo Loco is an example of an established chain that counts on
the Latino market to succeed. About half the Irvine-based restaurant
operator's sales come from its Latino clientele, said company
spokeswoman Julie Weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The quick-service segment of the restaurant industry is very
competitive and has been for many years. It's the nature of the
business we're in," Weeks said. As for competition from a potential
new chain, she said El Pollo Loco hopes to keep attracting customers
with its flame-broiled chicken.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Pollo Campero's chicken special, its loyalists say, is
its flavor and spices. But the company divulges little about the
ingredients except to say that it is marinated in a special
concoction over two days.</TE>
<TE>   Pollo Campero will begin a Spanish-language ad campaign on
television after the first few restaurants open, said Ricardo
Vasquez, director of Pollo Campero operations for Adir
Restaurants."Ay que rico! [How tasty!]" Pollo Campero fan Aguilar
said when he heard the chicken would soon be available in Los
Angeles. He said he plans to be one of the first in line.</TE>

<HD>Guild to Set Up Fund to Protect Actors</HD>

<LD>The Screen Actors Guild is expected to unveil today plans for a new
$1-million Actor Theft Protection Fund to cover actors against losses
when talent agencies fail or agents misappropriate funds.</LD>
<LD>   Establishing the fund was part of SAG's agreement last week with
agents governing relations between the two groups, although few
details were given at the time. That agreement, which allows limited
investment in agencies by advertising agencies and advertisers, still
must be approved by SAG's board and members.</LD>
<LD>   SAG said it will contribute $250,000 to the fund. An additional
$250,000 will come from agents represented by two groups, the Assn.
of Talent Agents and the National Assn. of Talent Representatives.</LD>
<TE>   Talent agencies also will contribute an additional $300 each
annually. The fund will pay claims up to $250,000, with bigger claims
covered by an insurance bond purchased by the fund.</TE>
<TE>   SAG said nearly $1 million has been lost in the last five years
when agencies failed or agents took money belonging to clients.</TE>
<TE>   The problem affects smaller Hollywood agencies rather than the
top-tier ones but nonetheless has resulted in several cases in which
SAG members lost large amounts of money. The biggest case occurred in
1999 with the bankruptcy of J. Michael Bloom &amp; Associates, in which
nearly $700,000 was lost, SAG said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What rights would I have, if any, as an employee who
chooses not to become a union member in an "agency shop" situation.</LD>
<LD>   Can I file a grievance? Does the union represent me just as it
does union members? Do I have the right to vote on the contract
proposal at a ratification meeting?</LD>
<LD>   --L.L., Riverside</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Unions are financed by the dues and fees of the employees
they represent.</TE>
<TE>   "Agency shop" arrangements are commonly used to finance unions
representing employees of school districts and state and local
governments. In an agency shop, employees are required to pay fees
for the services provided by their union, even if they are not union
members. The service fee cannot exceed the dues charged to regular
union members.</TE>
<TE>   Under most agency shop arrangements, failure to pay required
service fees can result in an employee's termination.</TE>
<TE>   In return for their payments, agency fee payers are entitled to
union representation. They can file grievances, and the union must
represent them to the same extent that it would regular union
members. Thus, a public sector union cannot charge a special
arbitration fee for nonmembers.</TE>
<TE>   By definition, however, agency fee payers have chosen not to be
union members. As such, they are not entitled to full membership
rights.</TE>
<TE>   For example, agency fee payers can be excluded from membership
meetings, barred from running for union office, denied special member
benefits (inexpensive life insurance and amusement park discounts,
for example), and prevented from voting on contract proposals at
ratification meetings.</TE>

<TE>   Penalty Could Be Due for Delaying Vacation Pay</TE>
<TE>   Q: Several months ago I was "furloughed" from my job. I did not
receive any vacation pay that was due me, the company explained,
because I would be rehired within a short time. Nothing was put in
writing.</TE>
<TE>   So far I have not been rehired and it doesn't look like I will be
in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   At what point am I considered terminated? How do I get my vacation
pay?</TE>
<TE>   --B.B., Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   A: You are entitled to all of your accrued vacation pay upon
termination of employment. It is unclear what your employer intended
by "furloughing" you, but it sounds as if you have been terminated.</TE>
<TE>   You should contact your former employer and ask that your accrued
vacation be paid without further delay.</TE>
<TE>   If it is not paid, you may file a claim with the state labor
commissioner. If you are successful you could be awarded a "waiting
time penalty" of 30 days' additional pay.</TE>
<TE>   You should remind your former employer of the possibility of this
penalty if payment is not forthcoming.</TE>

<TE>   Defamation Claim Tough to Prove, Expensive</TE>
<TE>   Q: Due to three job-related injuries, I have been relegated to
"light duty" at my company and have been performing a
management-level job.</TE>
<TE>   Though my work has been flawless, I was told that during a
management-only meeting, a supervisor made numerous slanderous
comments about me. These comments were extremely personal and
insulting.</TE>
<TE>   How can I deal with this on a legal basis?</TE>
<TE>   --T.A., Culver City</TE>
<TE>   A: I suggest that you speak to the supervisor who allegedly made
the comments and question him or her about what was actually said.
Often misunderstandings can be alleviated simply by talking things
out rather than relying on secondhand reports by others who may have
their own bias or agenda.</TE>
<TE>   If you are uncomfortable with this approach, you may want to ask
the head of personnel to assist you in resolving the issue.</TE>
<TE>   If you wish to pursue legal action, you should know that
defamation claims often are difficult to prove and expensive to
bring.</TE>
<TE>   In order to sustain a viable claim of defamation, you will be
required to prove that a false statement of fact was made about you
to others. If the speaker simply was giving an opinion, it will not
support a defamation claim.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on what was said, you also may have to prove that the
speaker made the statement with malice. You also might have to prove
economic losses, such as out-of-pocket expenses, medical bills or
time lost from work resulting from the statement.</TE>
<TE>   If this management-only meeting is considered comparable to an
employee performance evaluation, you would be subjected to an even
tougher standard. Courts have held that evaluations of employee
performance aren't defamatory unless the employee is falsely accused
of criminal conduct, lack of integrity, dishonesty, incompetence or
reprehensible personal characteristics or behavior.</TE>
<TE>   If you do wish to pursue legal action, I recommend that you
consult a labor attorney who represents employees. The attorney will
be better able to advise you whether the statements made rise to the
level of defamation.</TE>

<HD>Proposed Subsidy Cuts Pose Big-Farm Problems</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Congress is considering a lower cap on
assistance, which could force some large growers in California to
reduce production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California cotton and rice farmers would feel the brunt of proposed
federal legislation that would limit farm subsidies, economists and
farm groups said.</LD>
<LD>   Although the subsidy cuts are not targeted specifically at cotton
and rice growers, many of them would see their subsidies slashed
because they tend to have larger, higher-yielding farms, said
economist Dan Sumner, who heads the Agricultural Issues Center at UC
Davis. Meanwhile, Sumner said, payments to small and part-time
farmers in California and elsewhere would increase.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed subsidy cuts were sparked partly by outrage over the
number of corporations and wealthy individuals receiving subsidies.</LD>
<TE>   Billionaire stockbroker Charles Schwab, for instance, owns a
1,550-acre duck hunting club in Glenn County, Calif., on which he
grows rice. He received price supports totaling $564,000 from 1996 to
2000.</TE>
<TE>   But most who receive payments, economists said, are people who
make their living off farming.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these growers could be forced to reduce production and
some might abandon the crops entirely, trade officials said. That
could help bump floundering crop prices back up, but Sumner and
others said it undoubtedly would hurt the already struggling farm
economy in California.</TE>
<TE>   The American Farm Bureau Federation and several industry trade
groups are pushing to raise the subsidy limits per farm. However,
many California legislators may not resist lowering the caps when the
Senate bill is reconciled with a separate House version in a
conference committee.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer
support the caps and believe they are the right way to reduce the
burden of subsidies for taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who co-authored the amendment,
said the caps will aid small-to-mid-size farms while reducing support
to big corporate farms.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxpayers can now have confidence that farm assistance will be
targeted to those who need it most," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the legislation wouldn't affect all crops
equally. Large farms that produce cotton and rice, which are more
expensive to grow, would be hit harder than large corn and soybean
farms in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in California, where the average rice farm is close to
500 acres, the caps would affect half the state's farms and threaten
much of its harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Given California's higher land, labor, water and other costs,
California farmers argue that big farms are a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of government engineering is so unfair and unbalanced,"
said Joe Hogan, a third-generation farmer who grows rice with other
family members on 3,000 acres in Chico, Calif. "It discriminates
against the most efficient growers."</TE>
<TE>   Advocacy groups such as Taxpayers for Common Sense said these
producers should be efficient enough not to rely on subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller farms are the ones that the federal government has been
trying to target in the last couple of farm bills," said Cena
Swisher, a policy analyst for the group. Large farms, she said,
shouldn't need this money to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Keys of Environmental Working Group wonders: If these farms
can't make it, as large and efficient as they are, "is this a good
investment for taxpayers?"</TE>
<TE>   Environmental Working Group compiled a database of these subsidy
recipients in an attempt to show how high these payments were and
where they were going. Although California wasn't nearly as big a
recipient of these dollars as the Midwest, Keys said, the money is
concentrated in fewer hands.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of large rice and cotton farms often pull in hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year from these subsidy programs through
direct payments and loans they don't have to pay back. These
subsidies were initially conceived as a way to ensure the survival of
certain key agricultural products by guaranteeing farmers enough
money to raise their crops. However, by providing farmers with a
steady stream of income on certain crops, they encouraged
overproduction, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Entire industries were built around them. And even large farms
became reliant on them.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan's farm, R. Gorrill Ranch Enterprises, for instance, was one
of the largest recipients in California, receiving $3.9 million in
payments from 1996 to 2000, money that was split among 10 family
members.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hogan said, much of it goes to cover the rising costs of
his farming operation--to pay for expensive equipment, labor, water,
seed and sometimes rent.</TE>
<TE>   "On a per-acre basis, we are one of the lowest collectors of these
subsidies," Hogan said.</TE>
<TE>   The provision in the Senate bill still could be amended or
stripped from the legislation in the House-Senate conference
committee.. Caps in the House version are almost twice as high and
contain provisions allowing growers to collect more funds through
special programs.</TE>
<TE>   Current regulations make it hard for most California farmers to
reach payment limits with their production. Under the Senate
provision proposed by Grassley, operators could collect no more than
$275,000 per farm.</TE>
<TE>   Most rice farmers, Sumner said, would reach the new limit at
around 300 acres of production, just a portion of their total
acreage. Without these payments to support production on the rest of
their property, most would cut back, let the hard-packed clay land
lie fallow or use it as grazing land. Jobs would be lost, rice
production would plummet and rice mills could founder, he said.</TE>
<TE>   San Joaquin Valley cotton farmers probably would replace cotton
with another fruit or vegetable crop, adding to the oversupply of
these crops and bringing already depressed prices down further.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no fan of subsidy programs," Sumner said, but "these subsidy
caps won't do anything that their proponents want them to do. And
they will have significant negative impact on the agriculture
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Although rice isn't one of California's highest dollar crops, the
state is one of the nation's largest rice producers, second only to
Arkansas. And California produces some of the highest-valued rice,
much of which is exported to Japan and other markets.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton has slid to the rank of seventh-largest crop in the state
after years of rising costs and declining payments have made some
growers exit the business. However, California is still renowned for
its high-quality Pima cotton, used in dress shirts, sheets and
towels.</TE>
<TE>   Rice and cotton trade groups have been lobbying members of
Congress from California and elsewhere to take some kind of action to
protect the two industries.</TE>
<TE>   Rice growers said that to survive without subsidies or with
greatly reduced subsidies, they would need to open up new markets and
gain access to markets that have been shut off, such as Cuba, Iran
and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Many rice growers in California have switched to short-grain
specialty crops to cater to the more lucrative export market.</TE>
<TE>   But with lower-cost foreign competitors increasing production,
prices even for those crops have come down in recent years. And a
strong dollar has made American rice more expensive overseas,
dampening demand.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, production costs, for things such as water and labor,
have escalated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been trying to maximize this stuff growing wall to wall,"
Don Bransford said of his 600-acre farm in Colusa, Calif. But he said
that even with these economies of scale, the crop isn't profitable.</TE>
<TE>   California rice growers said they have to be large and efficient
to compete in the world market.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't own a $225,000 combine to farm 200 acres," said Al
Montna, who owns 2,000 acres in Yuba City, Calif., that is being
farmed by 10 entities. "What other industry has the government wiped
out to let the inefficient survive?"</TE>

<HD>A Study in Contrasts</HD>
<DH>Software is greatest difference between Mac, Windows PC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choosing between Apple's new iMac or a Windows XP computer involves
more than deciding between stylish white or basic beige.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the differences in hardware are significant, as last week's
comparisons of the iMac and Gateway's 500SE showed. The new iMac's
futuristic look and unique pivoting display give it the design and
engineering edge, but the iMac is a bit more expensive, a bit less
expandable and slightly slower than comparable Windows computers.</LD>
<LD>   But hardware is only part of the story. Software is where the
greatest differences exist between Macs and Windows PCs.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Box</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of software accompanies the iMac and the Gateway 500SE (and
most new Windows PCs).</TE>
<TE>   The iMac includes AppleWorks for word processing and business
tasks. There's also Apple's suite of "digital hub" programs: iTunes
for playing music and burning CDs, iPhoto for managing digital
pictures, iMovie for editing video and, on the $1799 iMac I tested,
iDVD for designing and burning DVDs. These programs share a similar,
straightforward design.</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway 500SE comes with the titanic Microsoft Word as well as
Works, Microsoft's Swiss Army Knife program; Money 2002, a personal
finance program; Encarta, an encyclopedia; Streets and Trips, a
digital road atlas; and Picture It Photo, an image-editing program
with more features than Apple's iPhoto.</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway's digital hub includes Microsoft's Windows Media
Player and Windows Movie Maker and the MusicMatch Jukebox MP3
program. These programs lack the features and elegance of Apple's
i-ware. Windows Media Player can't play MP3 tracks, Windows Movie
Maker can't record finished videos to tape, and MusicMatch Jukebox
has a brain-addling user interface.</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway has the edge for productivity, business and
image-editing tasks, while the iMac wins for music, movie editing and
DVD creation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operating Systems</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway runs Windows XP, while the iMac runs Apple's new Mac
OS X (it also includes the older OS 9).</TE>
<TE>   Both operating systems are powerful, with good crash-protection
features and lots of power-user goodies.</TE>
<TE>   Although both debuted last year, Windows XP is the more mature OS,
taking its underlying foundation from Microsoft's Windows 2000. Mac
OS X is a complete revamp of the Mac OS, and it feels like a work in
progress at times.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft has blundered by burdening Windows XP with frequent
sales pitches for Microsoft products and services. Getting started
with Windows XP is like watching network TV: The show isn't bad, but
the commercials are annoying.</TE>
<TE>   If Windows XP feels like ABC, Mac OS X feels like HBO. There are
occasional sales pitches--for example, iTunes has a command called
Shop for iTunes Products--but they're more subtle.</TE>
<TE>   And despite Mac OS X's relative immaturity, it's often more
reliable at connecting to new add-ons.</TE>
<TE>   Windows XP is better than earlier versions, but the Windows world
is a cacophony of computer makes and models, making compatibility
glitches inevitable. The frustration Windows users often experience
is reflected in a clickable link I found in Windows XP's online help:
"I still can't scan."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Software Selection</TE>
<TE>   More software is available for Windows than for the Mac. But all
mainstream programs, including Microsoft Office, are available for
both platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Windows has the edge in games and so-called vertical applications
(programs created for specific business niches). And you often can
run the latter on a Mac using Connectix Corp.'s VirtualPC software,
which lets Macs run Windows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Verdict</TE>
<TE>   Buying an iMac--indeed, any Mac--means spending somewhat more and
having somewhat fewer add-ons and programs to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   But the iMac and Apple's software have a design elegance that's
missing from the Windows world.</TE>
<TE>   I use both Macs and Windows XP computers daily, and the Mac is
less frustrating, less commercially intrusive and more elegant. Quite
simply, it's a better computer.</TE>

<LD>EBay Inc., the largest Internet auctioneer, will close its
money-losing Web site in Japan this month after two years of
struggling to gain online sales there.</LD>
<LD>   The company will shut down the site March 31 and give severance
packages to the 17 employees, spokesman Kevin Pursglove said.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time EBay has closed an overseas site.</LD>
<TE>   EBay is the fourth-largest online-auction site in Japan, falling
short of the company's goal of being the biggest in each of its 17
overseas markets.</TE>
<TE>   The site opened in February 2000 in a partnership with Japan's No.
3 chip maker, NEC Corp. EBay bought back NEC's 30% interest last year
as it sought to gain on Yahoo Japan Corp., which is the largest
online-auction site in Japan.</TE>

<HD>Batteries Fail to Keep Pace With Technology</HD>
<DH>Electronics: With few advances since the 1950s, they are
placing design limitations on the devices they run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Batteries, the technology that time forgot, should have disappeared
alongside the wood-paneled station wagon.</LD>
<LD>   The sealed chemical cocktails we use to power computers, boomboxes
and mobile phones are little changed since the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, electronics designers have struggled to tailor the
latest concoction in silicon chips and integrated circuits to the
power limitations of the lowly battery.</LD>
<TE>   "They're holding us back big time," said Paul Saffo, director of
the Institute for the Future. Had batteries advanced at the pace of
the computer processor, "a double-A cell would contain more energy
than a tactical nuke."</TE>
<TE>   Other than a few devices, such as weak solar cells and mechanical
cranking devices, there isn't an alternate portable power source.
Batteries are it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much you can do about it," said Boris Donskoy, who
designs portable electronic instruments for InHand Electronics Inc.
of Rockville, Md. "There are basic limitations in physics."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers talk of batteries being replaced at some point by
portable fuel cells and tiny jet engines--or a new battery made of a
better combination of chemicals. But no one can say when.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, we're stuck with a power source whose origins date
back to 1859, when the first lead acid battery was manufactured in
France.</TE>
<TE>   The same basic energy storage concept still fuels the 4 billion
disposable batteries sold each year in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The name of No. 3 battery seller Rayovac Corp. dates back to the
1930s, when radio technology got a boost from the introduction of
vacuum tubes, a technology replaced long ago by the transistor.</TE>
<TE>   Rayovac engineer Jim Pilarzyk said his industry has no hope of
keeping up with fast-morphing computer processors, which double in
speed and halve in size every 18 months. A 5% improvement in power
capacity every two years is about the best battery scientists can
manage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The battery industry is somewhat limited," Pilarzyk said.
"They're analog devices in a digital world."</TE>
<TE>   For all their shortcomings, comparing batteries with computers
isn't fair.</TE>
<TE>   Batteries' roots are in chemists' beakers. Computer speed is
pushed by advances in manufacturing and the ability to make circuits
and transistors smaller and smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "A battery isn't a microprocessor," said Donald Sadoway, a battery
researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It's a
chemical device. It observes different scaling laws."</TE>
<TE>   For designers of portable electronics, who yearn to shrink their
gadgets and add gobs of features, battery power is the choke point
that stunts their ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 20 years have been aimed at designing around the
limitations of batteries," Saffo said.</TE>
<TE>   If the device needs to be small, it won't run long. If it needs to
run long, it can't be small--or have power-guzzling add-ons such as a
fast processor, DVD drive, audio or a color display.</TE>
<TE>   "When I want to design something, my first question is 'How much
power does it consume?'" Donskoy said. "There's a big trade-off
between size, power consumption and cost."</TE>
<TE>   The thirst for portable power is relentless. As soon as a better
battery emerges, designers quickly respond with new gadgets that push
the cells to their limits.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, laptop computers were made possible by
rechargeable nickel-metal hydride and nickel-cadmium batteries, which
gave portables an operating life of about four hours.</TE>
<TE>   When more powerful lithium-ion batteries emerged in the late '90s,
the breakthrough allowed cell phones to shrink to shirt-pocket size.
Lithium cells fueled the release of hand-held computers, which could
run for several hours and even sport backlighted color screens.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, battery science has reached a plateau, scientists
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting to approach the engineering limits of that
chemistry," Sadoway said, referring to the lithium-ion cell.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem with batteries is environmental.</TE>
<TE>   Of the billions sold each year, most wind up in landfills and
incinerators, where their toxic contents--mercury, cadmium, zinc,
nickel and manganese among them--leach into the air and ground water,
said Allen Hershkowitz of the National Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   While chemists and engineers struggle to eke out a little more
power, consumers locked into buying and discarding batteries wonder
whether there's a conspiracy. Do manufacturers refuse to make a
better battery?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not economic for battery manufacturers to develop new
technology," said Bruce Rittenhouse, president of Electronic
Automation Inc., a Grand Rapids, Mich., company that repairs
industrial electronics. "Why do it? They want to sell you batteries
every month, not every six years."</TE>
<TE>   Lew Urry, a scientist with Energizer Holdings Inc., scoffs at that
notion. With Energizer and its archrival Duracell leapfrogging each
other, a slowdown in innovation gives the other company powerful
boasting rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't afford to let that happen," said Urry, 76, who helped
invent Eveready's first alkaline battery, which hit store shelves in
1958.</TE>

<HD>Patching Holes in the Net</HD>
<DH>Bush advisor Richard A. Clarke discusses ways to boost
cyber security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cyberspace security often seems reminiscent of the movie "Groundhog
Day," in which a TV weatherman played by Bill Murray wakes up and
relives the same day over and over.</LD>
<LD>   After each massively disruptive software infection or hacking
episode, users and computer administrators briefly get security
religion, swearing that this time they really will take precautions
and get things fixed. But such vigilance soon returns to sleepy
complacency, only to be followed by a rude awakening with the next
big breach.</LD>
<LD>   Richard A. Clarke, appointed in October as a special advisor to
President Bush on cyberspace security and chairman of the newly
established Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, is at the heart
of the government's efforts to interrupt that cycle and guard against
online crime and mischief. He reports to both National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Thomas J. Ridge, head of the new Office
of Homeland Security.</LD>
<TE>   The need for Internet security is huge. Analysts estimate that
attacks by hackers cost American businesses billions of dollars
annually in lost revenue and productivity. And since Sept. 11,
security experts have warned that terrorist hackers may be targeting
U.S. commerce, telecommunications and utility grids.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope America's new security consciousness will lead to
real improvements in online security.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke--a veteran national security and counter-terrorism expert
who has served four presidential administrations--has a strong
background to lead that charge. But with no authority to enforce new
security practices or policies, he must rely on moral suasion and the
power of the White House. Clarke talked with The Times about key
priorities for Internet security.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: Government and private industry networks seem wide open
to cyber attacks from hackers. What are the keys to improving the
situation?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The first step is to admit we have problems. A lot of
people in the private sector and the government haven't been willing
to admit that until recently. Part of the reason is that they assumed
that a certain amount of disruption in their information
technology--IT--systems was a cost of doing business, and a cost that
they could afford.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six to nine months, the costs have gotten much higher.
The sophistication and frequency of viruses, worms and
denial-of-service attacks, as well as hacks, has gotten to the point
where everyone realizes that we can't afford the level of damage that
is being done. And in the wake of Sept. 11, it's not just a matter of
damage that has been done in the past but the possibility of much
greater damage in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The second step is to develop a partnership between the private
sector and the government.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently said that on average, corporations spend only
about .0025% of revenue on IT security--less than they spend on
coffee for employees. How much should industry be spending on
improvements?</TE>
<TE>   A: There's not a direct, one-to-one correlation between how much
money you spend and what you get for it. But every manager, every
CEO, every member of a board of corporate directors ought to ask
themselves, "How much importance are we giving to IT security?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Given your small staff and lack of direct control over federal
agencies' policies, how will you push the agenda?</TE>
<TE>   A: The president created the Critical Infrastructure Protection
Board in October. That board is made up of senior people from various
federal departments.... [On the advice of that board], this year, for
the first time, departments had their budgets returned to them by the
White House and were instructed to increase the amount of funding for
IT security. As a result, the overall federal budget for 2003 has a
64% increase for IT security [to $4 billion].</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will that be sufficient to make major improvements in the
government's cyber security?</TE>
<TE>   A: It will take that level of investment for several years before
we are feeling more comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would it be fair to say that the hundreds of security holes in
Microsoft's nearly ubiquitous software products pose the biggest
computer security threat today?</TE>
<TE>   A: Microsoft [recently] made a decision to change the way they do
business, to make IT security the No. 1 design criterion and
subordinate other functionality to security in future products.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people greet that announcement with cynicism and doubt
because of the problems that Microsoft has had in the past with
security. It would be more constructive if we all said that we
welcome the new policy and will work with them to make sure it
happens. Because you're right--given the ubiquity of Microsoft
software, if there are problems in Microsoft, there are problems
throughout our infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What should Microsoft do differently?</TE>
<TE>   A: All software manufacturers need to design security into their
products rather than [putting] it on as an afterthought. Default
settings should have unnecessary programs and functions turned off.
Things should come out of the box with high security settings--the
customer would have to make an intentional decision to lower the
security.... Any software company now that brings products to market
riddled with security vulnerabilities risks losing market share.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Yet given Microsoft's monopolies, competitive pressures haven't
done much to improve its security record. Should the government
require security reviews or product certification?</TE>
<TE>   A: When the federal government gets into regulation, it frequently
gets ham-handed, and out of a wealth of good intentions becomes
clumsy and counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been a big backer of GovNet--the plan to create a
super-secure, government-only network. What are its advantages?</TE>
<TE>   A: Think of GovNet as a question rather than as a program. Are
there functions so critical that you don't want them connected to a
worldwide network that anyone can get into?... Where has it been
written that the control of the electric power grid should be
dependent on the Internet?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Much of the power grid management system is already separate
from the Internet, so why is this a problem?</TE>
<TE>   A: Electric power generation, distribution and transmission
systems, because of deregulation, are increasingly using Internet
connectivity. Even when they think they have networks that are not
connected to the Internet, when we do security audits we find out
that they are connected--for diagnostic purposes, repair purposes....
In general, there are some functions that are so critical that [they
should be on a separate] system. That's what we're exploring.</TE>

<HD>Northrop to Move on TRW in Hostile Bid</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: In response to rejection of unsolicited offer
made 10 days ago, defense contractor says it will file a $5.9-billion
tender offer today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. said Sunday it is launching a hostile bid to
acquire TRW Inc. for $5.9 billion, after TRW's board earlier in the
day rejected an unsolicited offer made 10 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop said it will take its bid directly to the shareholders by
filing a tender offer for TRW with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Monday. Northrop has been preparing for such a hostile
bid, anticipating a rejection by Cleveland-based TRW.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop, a Los Angeles-based defense contractor that has grown to
become an industry powerhouse, proposed a deal with TRW directors
Feb. 21, just three days after TRW's chief executive abruptly
resigned to take a top post at another aerospace firm.</LD>
<TE>   But TRW directors criticized the timing of the proposal and last
Wednesday asked for more time to consider it. Northrop had requested
a response by that date. TRW, a manufacturer of automotive parts and
defense satellites and electronics, has been one of the last in the
aerospace industry to avoid consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   In its tender, Northrop's offer will remain the same as its
initial bid--$47 in Northrop shares for each TRW share--but it will
cap the exchange ratio. The mechanics of that cap would mean that the
exchange ratio could not go above 0.45, equal to $103, Northrop
shares for each TRW share or below 0.41, equal to $113. On Friday,
Northrop shares gained 71 cents to close at $107.75 and TRW shares
closed down 20 cents to $50.05, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said the company was
turning to the shareholders because "we have not received a
substantive response from TRW regarding our Feb. 21 letter....</TE>
<TE>   "Accordingly, we are moving ahead to make this offer available to
TRW shareholders and to initiate all the steps that are necessary to
see it through to conclusion," Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa added that Northrop will request that TRW directors call a
special meeting of shareholders required under Ohio law. Moreover, he
said the company plans to file a lawsuit in Ohio challenging elements
of the state's anti-takeover laws.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio has some of the toughest anti-takeover laws in the nation. It
bars shareholders from ousting a staggered board without cause even
though hostile bids still have managed to succeed. Analysts have said
that the law merely provides more leverage to Ohio-based companies.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, if it succeeds in acquiring TRW, plans to immediately
spin off or sell the company's automotive business, which accounts
for 60% of sales and a large amount of its debt.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop is particularly interested in TRW's space and defense
electronics business, considered one of the premier operations in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa also seemed to extend an olive branch at the same time.
Kresa said Northrop "remains willing to entertain negotiations with
TRW regarding a transaction and would welcome the opportunity to
consider nonpublic information about TRW in order to consider any
enhanced values that might be demonstrated by such information."</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of a less-than-warm reception from TRW, Northrop
early last week retained D.F. King &amp; Co. a New York firm that
specializes in proxy solicitations. For its part, TRW hired proxy
firm Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc.</TE>

extend its current curbs on oil exports into the second quarter
during a visit to Moscow this week by OPEC chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   Russia has come under heavy pressure from the OPEC oil producers'
cartel to keep exports down and help boost flagging prices but faces
demands at home to ease the curbs to release a growing flood of oil
on the domestic market.</LD>
<LD>   Yusufov has said that Russia wanted oil prices to be in the range
of $20 to $25 per barrel.</LD>
<TE>   OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez and President Rilwanu Lukman
arrived over the weekend for the talks in Moscow, hoping to secure an
extension of Russia's 5% cut in oil exports.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is one of five
independent producers that pledged late last year to cooperate with
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb oil
supplies to prevent prices from crashing during the economic
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices Friday hit a six-month high after the Sept. 11 attacks
on the United States, and Yusufov said the aim now was to keep prices
stable and ensure OPEC and non-OPEC members made good on pledges to
curb exports.</TE>

<HD>Retail Earnings, Economic Reports Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, economic data and retailers' report cards will get Wall
Street's attention.</LD>
<LD>   Retail is the name of the game for the handful of companies set to
report quarterly earnings. Tuesday will bring numbers from Costco
Wholesale Corp., Kohl's Corp. and Staples Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday marks another pivotal event: Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan returns to Capitol Hill for the Senate leg of his
congressional testimony before U.S. lawmakers. Last Wednesday, his
cautiously upbeat presentation to a House committee sparked a brief
rally.</LD>
<TE>   Reports on service-sector activity and layoffs Tuesday will give
Wall Street something else to look at, besides a fistful of earnings.
The Institute for Supply Management will report on non-manufacturing
activity in February, with the figure expected to be 51, which would
show modest growth. A number below 50 is evidence of contraction.
Last month it was 49.6.</TE>
<TE>   The ISM service-sector data will be watched closely to see how it
dovetails with the ISM manufacturing index, which jumped to 54.7 in
February from 49.9 in January. That data, released Friday, reflected
expansion in the U.S. manufacturing sector for the first time after
18 months of decline.</TE>
<TE>   The market also will get a read on U.S. factory orders Wednesday.
In January, factory orders were expected to have risen 1%, according
to economists polled by Reuters. The month before, factory orders
rose 1.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the Big Daddy of economic data--the unemployment report
for February--will give Wall Street some clues on whether the
economic recovery is any closer at hand. The economy is expected to
have added a scant 9,000 non-farm jobs in February, compared with a
drop of 89,000 jobs in January, according to a Reuters poll of
economists. The unemployment rate, though, is expected to have risen
to 5.7% in February from 5.6% in January.</TE>

<HD>ISS Could Seal Fate of HP-Compaq Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders in Hewlett-Packard Co. have a few weeks remaining to
consider how they will vote on the company's controversial plan to
buy Compaq Computer Corp., but the fate of the $22-billion deal could
effectively be sealed this week, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 10% of HP shares--a block that could determine
whether the largest-ever computer merger succeeds--will be voted in
accordance with the opinion of Institutional Shareholder Services,
which plans to disclose its position on the deal by Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   ISS, as it is known, advises some 700 funds how to vote in proxy
battles, and many of its clients are obligated because of the
structure of their funds or potential conflicts of interest to follow
ISS advice.</LD>
<TE>   Although some fund managers expect ISS to side with HP management
and endorse the merger, a surprise decision by the Bethesda,
Md.-based firm to oppose it could sway enough votes to all but
scuttle the deal, which has failed to muster much enthusiasm on Wall
Street, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over the merger has grown nasty in recent days, pitting
HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who says the merger would create a
technology powerhouse to rival IBM Corp., against dissident director
Walter Hewlett, who says the deal would saddle the company his father
co-founded with a low-margin personal computer maker.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett wants Fiorina fired if the deal is scrapped. Fiorina says
Hewlett has been deceptive by leaking details of discussed executive
pay deals as well as by floating talk of bringing back former HP CEO
Lew Pratt to steer the company in the interim. Both sides have
buttressed their views with studies commissioned by outside analysts.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares, at $20.21 at Friday's close on the New York Stock
Exchange, were down 13% since the deal was announced Sept. 3,
compared with a 3% rise for IBM over that period.</TE>

<HD>Jury Selection to Start in Genentech Retrial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jury selection begins Thursday in the retrial of City of Hope
National Medical Center's $445-million breach-of-contract suit
against Genentech Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The Duarte-based cancer treatment center has accused Genentech of
hiding lucrative licensing deals to avoid paying City of Hope
royalties under a 26-year-old research contract. The pact led to the
discovery of a method to produce human insulin, the world's first
biotechnology drug.</LD>
<LD>   Genentech, based in South San Francisco, denies the allegations.</LD>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury in October deadlocked 7 to 5 in
favor of Genentech after six days of deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech has paid City of Hope more than $285 million in
royalties on human insulin and human growth hormone under the 1976
contract. Under the deal, City of Hope gave Genentech the patent on a
method of producing drugs from bacteria. Genentech, in turn, provided
City of Hope with research funding and royalties.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have different interpretations of the research
agreement, formed when Genentech, now the second-largest
biotechnology company, had one full-time employee. City of Hope
claims Genentech owes it royalties on sales of drugs produced by
third parties that licensed the patent from Genentech. City of Hope
calculates that Genentech owes it $332 million in royalties and $114
million in interest in 22 drugs sold by third parties, including
hepatitis B vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech contends that City of Hope is wrong. It said that the
medical center is entitled to royalties only on drugs that meet two
conditions: that they use the discovery covered by the patent and
that City of Hope scientists helped invent the drugs. The only
products sold under those terms are human insulin and human growth
hormone, Genentech said. The royalty agreement on human insulin
expired in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Better Fuel Economy Lessens Oil Dependence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Government Should Steer Clear of the Fuel Economy Issue,"
Commentary, March 1: William N. Niskanen and Peter Van Doren would
have us believe that increasing fuel economy increases our dependence
on imported oil. By that logic, all we need to do to decrease our
dependence on oil is to waste as much fuel as possible!</LD>
<LD>   Then they whine about how corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standards imposed on auto makers will increase the price of
low-gas-mileage vehicles. I say, great! Why should I subsidize the
gas hog who gets 10 miles to the gallon? If he can afford to burn gas
like it's water, then let him pay more for the luxury.</LD>
<LD>   Then they propose a gas tax, which will hurt the poor much more
than the rich. Real fair, that. And there's more. They say that cars
that use less gasoline per mile lead people to drive more--a "10%
increase in mpg results in a 2% increase in vehicle miles traveled."
So what? That's a net 8% decrease in fuel consumption, or don't they
teach math at the Cato Institute?</LD>
<TE>   Joseph Barrett Bland</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tougher gas mileage standards for America's cars and trucks will
result in real energy savings ("Bush Team to Oppose Democrats' Fuel
Standard Plan," Feb. 28). But in opposing the Senate CAFE plan, the
White House is endorsing a "do nothing" version included in energy
legislation passed by the House last year.</TE>
<TE>   The House provision weakens existing requirements for the
Department of Transportation to increase gas mileage standards. And
when coupled with a loophole for vehicles that can be run on ethanol
(but almost never are), this plan will actually increase gas
consumption, erasing any fuel savings and deepening the United
States' oil dependence.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill, on the other hand, covers both cars and all light
trucks and calls for ongoing increases in fuel efficiency through
2013, so its fuel savings will build with time. By 2015, for example,
savings will equal more than 20 billion gallons per year.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers already have the technological capability to produce a
substantial increase in fuel economy. Regulatory guidance to tap that
potential is essential for America's energy security as well as
environmental protection.</TE>

<LD>Re "Let's Roll Against Saddam Hussein," Commentary, Feb. 28: I
absolutely disagree with David McCormick's views about "removing"
Saddam Hussein. We have no moral authority to attack another
sovereign nation no matter under what pretext. Iraq has not invaded
or attacked another country as it did before the Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   As per the suffering of the Iraqi people, we should take a lion's
share of the responsibility; the crippling embargo on Iraq during
last the 11 years has been imposed at our bidding. There is no moral
justification for denying little children and the old people the most
basic health care. Hundreds of thousands of children have died
because of the embargo.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Hussein is a most despicable and ruthless dictator. But that
does not give us any moral right to attack Iraq and cause thousands
of civilian casualties.</LD>
<TE>   Chaitanya Dave</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The drumbeats for attacking Iraq are increasing. Our Congress gave
the president the ability to respond to the tragedy of Sept. 11. It
approved a response to those who helped bring the terror about. But
our elected representatives did not authorize the invasion of Iraq.
They did not authorize the administration to wage war any time,
anywhere. They did not authorize war without end.</TE>

<LD>Textron is a $12-billion, diversified multi-industry company that has
grown and evolved quite successfully during its 80-year history. By
linking Textron with arguably "failed" conglomerates, "Enron a Rerun
of History" (Feb. 22) misses what is most notable about Textron's
story. In contrast to Ling-Temco-Vought, an over-leveraged company
that twice filed for Chapter 11, and ITT, a conglomerate that several
years ago completed the unwinding of its portfolio by splitting into
three distinct businesses, we have successfully adapted our portfolio
and business strategy to reward shareholders handsomely over the past
30 years. Our stock price has increased by about 1,000% since May
1970.</LD>
<LD>   Our story bears no resemblance to the debacles of Enron, ITT and
LTV. We are listed as one of Fortune magazine's "most admired"
companies and Industry Week magazine's "best managed companies." This
is a corporate history to make Textron's customers, employees and
shareholders proud.</LD>

<LD>The state was paying vehicle owners $1,000 to scrap old,
high-polluting cars to help reduce pollution. Your Feb. 28 article
discussing the demise of this program cited a motorist who applied
for the $1,000 to scrap a vehicle that is not running and that he
does not intend to repair. Since this car is creating no pollution,
why would he expect a program designed to reduce pollution to pay him
to scrap it? And why use his situation to illustrate the impact of
the program's demise? Using this logic, there must be thousands of
cars in junkyards that also have been affected by the program's
demise.</LD>

Role Has Become That of Peacekeeper'' (Feb. 25) states that ''Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld continues to argue against a U.S.
peacekeeping role in the country. But he acknowledged last week that
such a mission could become the endgame for American forces.'' It
goes on to state that ''Pentagon officials have suggested that [an
Afghan] army could be constituted in as little as six months'' but
that military analysts warn that ''establishing such an army,
however, will take time.'' Get ready to connect the dots.</LD>

<LD>Re ''It's Tough to Throw Compton's Bums Out,'' March 1: Steve Lopez's
portrayal of Eric Perrodin was glib and made for cute reading but was
grossly unfair. Perrodin carries a gun because he is a former police
officer and licensed to carry one and because his life is constantly
in danger due to his run for mayor of Compton. As mayor, Perrodin is
entitled to financial perks that he has refused. He also buys one
computer each month out of his city paycheck for the beleaguered
Compton schools.</LD>
<LD>   Perrodin dotes on his mother and is a devout Catholic who actually
attends church. He is a man of honor whom I am proud to call my
friend. If Lopez knew how hard Perrodin has worked to try to clean up
Compton, he'd feel ashamed of his portrayal of him.</LD>

<TE>   Someone get me the numbers for Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
This political battle for the mayor's office in Compton has the
makings of a first-class musical a la ''Evita'' and ''West Side
Story.''</TE>
<TE>   Picture it: the steps of Compton City Hall. Perrodin stands before
a cheering crowd of supporters with his arms outstretched, singing,
''Don't cry for me, Compton. The truth is I never left you.'' While
on the other side of town, Omar Bradley, consoling his weeping
supporters, sings, ''There's a place for us, somewhere there's a
place for us.''</TE>

<TE>   Mayor Omar Bradley was not back in office more than one week in
Compton when the City Council rubber-stamped his request for the
reimbursement of $840,000 in personal legal fees, plus an additional
$43,000 in back wages (Feb. 28). They accomplished all of this while
Bradley's case was under court review and very likely to be
overturned. All this tells one about the city of Compton is that it
was not a municipality but a monarchy, and Bradley was the king.</TE>

<LD>"Army's Reality Game Takes a Deadly Turn" (Feb. 27) left a larger
question unanswered. What traffic violation allowed Deputy Randall
Butler to pull over the pickup truck in which Lt. Tallas Tomeny was
riding? Is it against some law to be a redneck--"each [driver and two
passengers] unshaven and wearing blue jeans and flannel shirts"?</LD>
<LD>   The prior week Officer J.D. Garner pulled over a truck towing a
canvas-covered trailer. I missed the traffic violation that prompted
that story.</LD>
<LD>   What we have here is that cops can pull over anyone for no reason,
with impunity, as condoned by judges up to and including the Supreme
Court. We are no longer "secure in our persons, houses, papers and
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ants may be pesky to humans. But they are deadly to lizards.</LD>
<LD>   Two papers published in February suggest that a severe decline in
coastal horned lizards in Southern California is due to the
proliferation of Argentine ants, the tiny creatures that regularly
invade homes during the rainy season.</LD>
<LD>   The ants, which hail from South America, are so successful here
that they have displaced many of the larger native ants that lizards
traditionally ate. In laboratory studies, scientists at UC San Diego
found that lizards didn't seem to care for the taste of imported ants
and lost weight unless they were given native ants.</LD>
<TE>   The result "demonstrates that invasions can have communitywide
effects," said Andy Suarez, the lead author on one study.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists at the University of Michigan have pieced together the
complex genetic workings that allow anthrax to remain dormant for
decades in harsh conditions but begin to germinate in a matter of
minutes when circumstances are right.</LD>
<LD>   Anthrax can survive for decades because it is protected by a tough
outer coat that is impervious to cold, heat, drought and chemicals. A
new study shows that germination from the dormant state requires the
coordinated activity of several genes, proteins and amino acids and
at least two signaling pathways.</LD>
<LD>   The redundant mechanisms are "the bug's way of ensuring that it
won't lose its protective armor until conditions are right for
germination," co-author Philip Hanna said. The study is an important
first step in preventing anthrax infections.</LD>

<LD>Chip-making giant Intel Corp. plans to upgrade its flagship Pentium 4
processor for desktop computers next year and make another version
available for laptops in coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The desktop Pentium 4, code-named Prescott, will incorporate a new
technology called hyper-threading that tricks the operating system
into thinking it is running on two processors instead of one.</LD>
<LD>   The company also demonstrated a 4-gigahertz Pentium 4, which is
expected to be available next year. Currently, the Pentium 4 line
tops out at 2.2 GHz.</LD>
<TE>   Intel also plans to release Pentium 4-based mobile processors that
run at greater than 1.5 GHz.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. government got an online face lift last week as Vice
President Dick Cheney unveiled an updated government Web site that
encourages citizens to do everything from paying taxes to booking
campground sites over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The redesigned site, at www.firstgov.gov, ropes together federal
Web pages, along with state and local government sites, to provide a
wide array of services and information.</LD>
<LD>   Citizens can apply for jobs or student loans, renew driver's
licenses and buy stamps through the site.</LD>
<TE>   Businesses can check laws and regulations, file patents and
trademarks and look into contracting opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The new site should cut down on red tape, Cheney said, making
government interactions easier and more convenient.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an attempt to remedy one of government's oldest problems:
the slow, confusing way it responds to the public," he said.</TE>

<LD>Patt Morrison's Inside Politics ("Lockyer's Elements in Ca. Political
Chemistry," Feb. 25), describing Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's new
elements (Burtonium, Enronium, etc.), reminded me of some other rare
elements, often sought in the aerospace industry.</LD>
<LD>   One is balloonium, a favorite of designers whose projects are
exceeding weight targets. Balloonium has a negative density, so the
more you use, the lighter the structure becomes. The other is
unobtanium, which always seems to be in short supply.</LD>
<LD>   As the current election contests diverge toward pandemonium, we
are being inundated with effluvium from the candidates. What's most
discouraging is that we have to put up with all the garbage for eight
more months before the November election. Aarrgh!</LD>

<HD>Once Deemed Safe, Kava Now Linked With Liver Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRIE R. CASSILETH</AU>
<BD>Barrie R. Cassileth, PhD, is chief of integrative
medicine at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, disappointing news appears about a natural product that
seems to benefit our health. Such is the case with kava, a herbal
remedy sold in the United States as an alternative pain reliever,
relaxation aid and memory enhancer.</LD>
<LD>   Recent reports from Germany and Switzerland suggest that kava may
damage the liver. At least 24 cases of liver toxicity associated with
the use of kava products have been reported internationally,
including one death and several patients who required liver
transplantation. The Swiss government has prohibited the sale of all
products containing kava extract.</LD>
<LD>   And Canadian health officials have warned consumers not to use any
products that contain kava. Government warnings indicate that kava
may be an ingredient in herbal and homeopathic preparations sold to
treat anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, pain and muscle tension, and
those warnings are reminders about the importance of reading labels
on all herbal products. Canadian officials also advise consumers to
contact their physicians if they experience any adverse effects from
taking products containing kava.</LD>
<TE>   The following symptoms may be associated with liver problems:
jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes); brown urine;
nausea or vomiting; unusual fatigue or weakness; and stomach or
abdominal pain.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet issued a warning
about kava. Last December, however, the agency asked physicians to
report cases of patients experiencing liver toxicity to determine
whether such cases may be related to kava in dietary supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Despite international concern, kava is still widely available in
this country. I checked with a leading health food and vitamin
retailer in New York and another in Los Angeles that were still
displaying kava products for sale on their shelves and in catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   The kava situation and the absence of federal regulations to
protect consumers demonstrate the need for caution when purchasing
over-the-counter food supplements. Although manufacturers are urged
to register claims that are printed on product labels with the FDA,
the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 leaves the
FDA with little or no authority to regulate vitamins, herbs and other
nonprescription remedies for safety until a disaster or near disaster
has occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1994 rules, the manufacturer--not the federal
government--is responsible for ensuring that a dietary supplement is
safe before it is marketed. The FDA can restrain sales or recall a
product only after dangerous or life-threatening results are
reported.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 90,000 Web sites referencing kava. I would
recommend such sites as the FDA's www.fda.gov and the American
Botanical Council's Web site, www.herbalgram.org. It is best not to
depend on promotional information offered on most Web sites. One site
I looked at described the reports of liver damage from kava use in
Europe, but a few paragraphs later stated, "Thus far, research shows
kava to be safe."</TE>
<TE>   Kava remains an important part of social, cultural and religious
life of South Pacific islanders. Often served from a large wooden
bowl at social and ceremonial events, it is passed around and
consumed by people seeking to relax, loosen up and feel good. It is
not, apparently, consumed on a regular basis, and this may be a key
distinction. Regular use of kava over a long period may create
problems though occasional use may be safe or at least less
problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has not been studied thoroughly, good scientific
studies suggest that kava extract is superior to placebo against
anxiety and, until recently, kava was described as safe. There is
much to be learned about the potential benefits and safe use of kava.
For the time being, however, the possibility of serious liver damage
is reason enough to think twice about using it and to be sure to talk
to your doctor before trying it. Personally, I don't think it's worth
the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Other herbal therapies used to treat stress or insomnia include
valerian capsules and chamomile or passion flower tea. Melatonin, a
substance produced naturally by the body in response to light, also
is available as a supplement and used against sleeplessness and jet
lag. These products can interact with other sedatives and should not
be taken for more than a few days, as continued use may mask
underlying problems that require medical attention.</TE>

<LD>It was absolutely refreshing to have read John Balzar's Feb. 27
commentary, "We Are in Danger of Losing Our Way." I sometimes feel as
if we already have. Like the environmentalists who fervently want to
leave behind a clean planet for future generations to inhabit, I
believe as strongly that we should be teaching our youngsters about
right and wrong and the consequences of one's actions. The points
Balzar illustrates merit hanging his commentary in clear view in any
home, classroom or place of employment.</LD>
<LD>   It is the duty of responsible adults to convey to their children
that it is not OK to excel at the expense of another. Shame on us if
we fail to educate our children, and if we fail at that task, perhaps
we are deserving of biting into that habanero that Balzar talks
about.</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to Balzar for pinpointing the moral and ethical malaise that
links Enron and Napster and the whole gamut of behavior and attitudes
in between. Better still to have connected a few more dots,
especially those huddled around the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   It was greed, not justice and not truth, that landed this
President Bush in the White House. What has followed in its
wake--national and world events notwithstanding--is an amen chorus
of, in Balzar's apt words, "apologists, explainers or excuse makers."</TE>
<TE>   If we teach and learn by example, then the line from Crawford,
Texas, to Enron and Napster should indeed stand in bold relief.</TE>

<AU>PAUL DEAN</AU>
<BD>Paul Dean, a former Times staff writer and automotive
reviewer, is editor at large of Robb Report magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Chuck Yeager became the first man to fly faster than the speed
of sound, when Roger Bannister became the first human to run a
four-minute mile, they were guaranteed immortality. To the Olympic
downhill skier, to the Indy race driver, to the Boston Marathon
runner, to the Whitbread sailor, to the Reno air racer, to the Tour
de France cyclist go the race and the glory--our awe and respect, the
adoration of young boys, the affection of ladies and the applause of
millions.</LD>
<LD>   What gives with speed, anyway? Why do so many of us seek the
adrenaline rush that comes with pushing beyond known limits or
sensible norms?</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it is knowing that the far edge of life is the near edge
of death and that being on that razor's edge is waltzing with the
devil, shivering from the stimulation of pure survival. As fledgling
war correspondent Winston Churchill once noted, there is nothing
quite as exhilarating as the crack of the shot that misses.</LD>
<TE>   Speed and daring are also forms of thumbing our noses. By
adventuring, by risking, we still whatever secret jelly quivers
inside us.</TE>
<TE>   It may also be that we are just soul-weary of a hundred levels of
government dictating our health, welfare and safety. Which may well
explain why an estimated 45million Americans regularly face the
absurd challenges of skydiving, drag racing, bungee jumping,
white-water rafting--anything that doesn't involve popcorn and a Sony
remote.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting that pathology, it is no wonder that even the
Evian-mannered lose reason and restraint once they get behind the
wheel of a car.</TE>
<TE>   We're not talking of our amateur criminals who pound the pedal to
the carpet in anger, recklessness and frustration, compounded by a
chemically amplified sense of invincibility. That human weakness came
with the first DUI, which came shortly after the 1903 introduction of
the Ford Model A.</TE>
<TE>   No, the peculiarity here is the gentle owner of a Honda Accord,
the God-fearing grandfather and the law-abiding soccer mom, the
novitiate and the political science major, the respected artisan and
the sober professional, who see 120mph not as a number on a
speedometer but as a target. Because it is there.</TE>
<TE>   I have been entranced with speed since age 8, when I built a sand
race car on the beach, stuck a bucket on my head and gear-shifted my
sand shovel while yelping "grrerrrrerah ... vroom."</TE>
<TE>   It took me several years to actually find a way to speed, but
since then I have driven a car at 201.6mph, flown a plane at Mach
2.2, piloted an offshore racing boat at 105.5mph and swum 100 meters
in 56.9 seconds. Note those precise numbers and decimal points. The
addiction reveals itself in the details.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the thrill of speed on open waters or in empty skies or on
skis down a lonely Alp may be easily dismissed as no more than the
search for a kick in the pants. Yet there's also the satisfaction of
managing self and machine and melding instincts with learned skills.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when it comes to automobiles. I remember the
explanation of a living racing legend, Sir Stirling Moss, who decreed
that any silly bloke can drive fast in a straight line. No talent in
that. The absolute of racing, he said, was seeing a driver take a
corner at nine-tenths that you proceed take at ten-tenths. Then, he
concluded, you are a Rembrandt, who, having created a masterpiece,
set down his brush and informed his peers: "There ... beat that."</TE>
<TE>   For the thoroughly experienced, driving a car at speed is a
perfect amalgam of physics, adrenaline, pride and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   It is a matter of reading a car, knowing its limits of balance and
adhesion, sensing its weight shifting fore and aft to the forces of
braking, turning and accelerating, knowing even when a car is feeling
irritable.</TE>
<TE>   And when it wants to play, there is a lightness of being, an
equilibrium that you and it have created. There's the drug.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the rub: This cannot be done just anywhere. The
downside is obvious: Each year, as most people know by now, about the
same number of Americans die in highway accidents as were killed by a
decade of fighting in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   With two vehicles approaching head-on at a closing speed of
150mph, no seat belt or air bag will prevent bones from becoming jam.
Passengers get decapitated. Drivers get cut in half. Remember James
Dean. Think of Princess Diana.</TE>
<TE>   Sad but true: Ninety-eight percent of today's drivers are
incapable of handling a car at high speed, and there's nothing more
dangerous than ignorant daring.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there are ways to learn to speed with skill, but few of us
take the time to go beyond our high school driver's ed classes.
Today's motorists don't know the capability of their automobiles and
have even less understanding of their own abilities. And God really
does not protect fools and drunks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's hard to shake the desire for speed. It is a social
scourge, an aphrodisiac, a fatal poison. It is a siren singing to an
impatient society forever obsessed with time and distance.</TE>

<HD>Bunny Allen, 95; 'White Hunter'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He boasted of once killing a charging rhino with a Masai spear, then
dropping three more with a rifle in 20 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   He proudly displayed the scar on his forearm where a leopard sank
its teeth until an African gun bearer blasted the animal off him.</LD>
<LD>   He talked about his nose, which had been broken by a lion; and his
bad hip, the result of a buffalo goring. And, after a few drinks,
he'd talk about the romantic liaisons he had while on safari.</LD>
<TE>   Bunny Allen, the last of Africa's legendary "white hunters," whose
tales of big game kills rivaled stories of his pursuit of beautiful
women, died in his sleep in late January at his home on the island of
Lamu off the coast of Kenya. He was 95. The exact date and cause of
his death were not available.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who retired to a waterfront Muslim town on the Indian Ocean
many years ago, had no shortage of tales from his days as a
professional hunter--a career that began in 1927, 50 years before
Kenya banned big-game hunting.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, whose part-gypsy father worked for an insurance company,
grew up in Berkshire, England, where gypsies taught him to hunt. Born
Frank Maurice Allen, he earned his nickname Bunny for his skill in
snaring rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   Allen arrived in Africa at 21, hoping to find work as an
apprentice to a professional hunter. His first safari was led by Bror
Blixen, husband of Karen Blixen, the writer known as Isak Dinesen.
(In the film version of Dinesen's book "Out of Africa," Bror Blixen
was portrayed by Klaus Maria Brandauer and Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen
by Meryl Streep.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1928, Allen was assistant to Denys Finch-Hatton (played by
Robert Redford in "Out of Africa") on a safari with the Prince of
Wales. Allen later hunted with Philip Percival, the model for the
character Pop in Ernest Hemingway's "Green Hills of Africa" and
organized buffalo hunts for Prince Aly Khan.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Allen served as acting regimental sergeant
major in the King's African Rifles and fought the Italians in
Somaliland.</TE>
<TE>   After battles, the dead bodies would be picked over by lions.
Having been given a taste for human blood, the lions began killing
the locals, who asked the soldiers for help.</TE>
<TE>   Taught to track lions by warrior tribesmen he commanded, Allen
found and killed two lions sunning themselves after eating a
villager.</TE>
<TE>   He later said the Italians sent a note to his regiment, saying:
"Please pass on our hearty congratulations to those who got rid of
the man-hunters. We can now get on with the war."</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood filmmakers came to Africa in the 1950s, it was
Allen whose services they enlisted.</TE>
<TE>   He scouted locations for John Huston's "The African Queen" and
worked on "Safari," "King Solomon's Mines" and "Where No Vultures
Fly."</TE>
<TE>   And when director John Ford's cast and crew arrived in
southwestern Kenya to make "Mogambo," Allen organized and supervised
a 300-tent camp, as well as 20 white hunters, an unknown number of
bearers and more than 1,000 Samburu warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Allen also stood in for the film's male star, Clark Gable, in
dangerous shooting scenes. And he reportedly had an affair with the
film's female star, Ava Gardner, even while Allen's wife, Murielle,
served as wardrobe mistress.</TE>
<TE>   "A beautiful girl, a beautiful character, a beautiful walk," he
once said of the actress, who was married to Frank Sinatra at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "A petty chap," he said of the famously jealous Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Gardner once said of Allen: "He was the kind of man
any girl would trust to lead her into the jungle."Tall, with wavy
dark hair and an aquiline nose, the sun-bronzed Allen never disputed
his reputation as a lady's man.</TE>
<TE>   "A hunter's life is primitive stuff, and not just during the day,"
he once explained. "It's intimate, and things happen. Emotions are
stirred, which spill over into the evening; affairs are inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Of the various animals he hunted, Allen told the New York Times in
1989, he had "a great admiration for the buffalo, a magnificently
strong, brave and pretty formidable opponent. I had no compunction at
shooting a buffalo. Most other animals I always had a slight feeling
of remorse."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's son, David, now a gamekeeper, once saved his father's life
when a buffalo charged him.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's gun bearer had mistakenly handed him a rifle without
ammunition just as a buffalo was headed toward him. Allen avoided the
animal's horns by swinging himself on top of the buffalo's head and
was carried along until his son shot the buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   "All the soft parts of the buffalo fell on me," Allen recalled. "I
got away with a few broken ribs."</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Allen expressed contempt for modern-day
poachers, particularly those who killed elephants by the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "The older I've got, the more I've hated killing anything,
including snakes," he said. "I think they all have a job in life."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who wrote three volumes of memoirs, was the subject of a
1996 documentary, "A Gypsy Life."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son David, Allen is survived by his third wife,
Jeri; and two other children from his first marriage, Lavinia and
Anton; and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Desmond Plunkett, 86; RAF Pilot Helped Plan WWII's 'Great
Escape'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Desmond Plunkett, a Royal Air Force flier who helped plot the daring
World War II prison camp breakout that inspired the Steve McQueen
film "The Great Escape," has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Plunkett, who lived in Storrington, England, died Feb. 14,
according to the RAF Assn., a veterans group. It did not give the
cause of death or say where he died.</LD>
<LD>   Prisoners at the Stalag Luft III Nazi prison camp put
Plunkett--who had been shot down over occupied Holland on June 20,
1942--in charge of making 1,500 maps that the men would need to get
to safety after tunneling to freedom.</LD>
<TE>   Using ink from melted crayons and gelatin taken from Red Cross
food packages, Plunkett and his team assembled a crude mimeographing
system that let him print about 20 copies from every original map
they drew, said Jonathan Vance, a history professor at the University
of Western Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Although 76 men broke out the night of March 23, 1944, the
plotters had planned to help about 200 escape, and each would have
needed many maps to reach safety from the camp in Sagan in
southeastern Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett's team based its work on maps stolen from supply trucks
or obtained from guards through bribes or blackmail, said Vance, who
interviewed Plunkett for a book about the escape, "A Gallant
Company."</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the key organizers; he was really in the inner
circle of escape planners," Vance said.</TE>
<TE>   "It required quite an organization to find out where everybody was
trying to get to and then get them the maps to get there."</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a year of planning and digging, 76 men--all Allied
soldiers--crawled out of the camp through a 300-foot-long tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   But 73 were recaptured, and 50 were executed immediately on orders
from Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett, who traveled with Bedrich "Freddy" Dvorak of
Czechoslovakia, evaded capture for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The two were the last of the group to be caught when they were
picked up at the Czech-German border April 8, 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett spent more than two months in a Gestapo prison in Prague
before being moved to a camp in northeastern Germany, where he
remained until the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced he had said something under interrogation that caused
the Germans to execute the others, Plunkett attempted suicide, Vance
said. Fellow POWs reminded him that the men were put to death before
he was captured.</TE>
<TE>   Vance said it was hard to say whether Plunkett was depicted in the
1963 film because many of the characters were composites.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett lived briefly in Pakistan and India after the war, and
then moved to Rhodesia, where he started what became a successful
flying company.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Britain in the late 1990s and lived at the Royal
Air Force Assn.'s home in Storrington.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett is survived by his wife, Patricia; a son; and two
daughters.</TE>

<HD>Mary Stuart, 75; Star of 'Search for Tomorrow,' 'Guiding
Light'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Stuart, the stalwart star throughout the 35-year run of the
popular soap opera built around her character, "Search for Tomorrow,"
has died. She was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Stuart, who began as Joanne "Jo" Gardner Barron and ended the show
as Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur, died Thursday at her
New York City home of complications from a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame in 1995, Stuart also
played the character Meta Bauer on another durable soap opera,
"Guiding Light," from 1996 until her death.</LD>
<TE>   Born Mary Stuart Houchins on the 4th of July in Miami, and reared
in Tulsa, Okla., the future actress briefly attended the University
of Tulsa and worked for three weeks as a cub reporter on the Tulsa
Tribune. She was bounced, she later explained, because of a "chronic
feud between myself and spelling authorities."</TE>
<TE>   But she also gravitated early to acting, working with the Tulsa
Little Theater, a USO group and even singing with Count Basie's
orchestra when it came through town. In her late teens, she
hitchhiked to New York, where she became a photographer's model and a
nightclub photographer at the Roosevelt Grill. "Do you sing?" a quiet
man asked one night.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she told producer Joseph Pasternak, who quickly gave her a
screen test and then an MGM contract.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart had bit parts as a cigarette girl, hatcheck girl and
ingenue in nearly two dozen motion pictures during her brief
Hollywood tenure in the 1940s, including "Adventures of Don Juan"
with Errol Flynn and "The Girl From Jones Beach" with Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, she could sing, later recording two albums, "Mary
Stuart" and "Joanne Sings."</TE>
<TE>   But her true career began Sept. 3, 1951, when the daytime drama
"Search for Tomorrow" hit the airwaves on CBS. At the time the show
ended on NBC on Dec. 26, 1986, it was the longest-running soap opera
on television.</TE>
<TE>   And as Joanne, the character around whose life in Henderson,
U.S.A., the series was built, Stuart was the only cast member to last
the entire run. (A close second was co-star Larry Haines as Stu
Bergman, who joined two months after the show began and remained
through the final episode.)</TE>
<TE>   "We're not just a show, you know," Stuart told a reporter in 1982.
"We're part of history. The last 30 years happen to have been pretty
tumultuous times--not only for the country, but especially for women,
and all of that is the history of our program."</TE>
<TE>   (In real life, the actress was always liberated--even in her early
Hollywood days. In the 1940s, when contract ingenues were supposed to
be little more than pretty, she wore jeans and boots, drove a truck
instead of a sedan, smoked cigars, read books and had a Laurel Canyon
house filled with 16 animals, including dogs, cats and opossums.)</TE>
<TE>   Soap operas, she told The Times in 1978 during a visit to Los
Angeles from her show's home base in New York, help provide
continuity in an ever-changing world.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a continuing conversation," she said. "People imagine
themselves in the same situation and say, 'If I was faced with that,
how would I handle it? How would I play it out?' For them, it is a
release. Good company."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart's character, Joanne, evolved right along with real-life
women as they moved into the workplace and became more assertive.
Initially, Joanne ran a rooming house, cooking and making beds for
her boarders. She wore dresses a size too large, aprons and her hair
in a bun. As she aged, she became more glamorous and accomplished,
working as a librarian, personnel director, owner and operator of her
own inn and a city councilwoman. She learned to play the guitar and
often sang and played to entertain friends and guests.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart's Joanne also gave viewers a role model for coping with
many of life's problems--and certainly tallied more than any ordinary
woman. She was the first to have her actual pregnancy written into
the script and was filmed in the hospital after giving birth to her
son in 1956--only to have the television baby die soon after in an
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Her character was widowed three times and kidnapped three times.
Only her intervention stopped a third triple tragedy, when she told a
new writer in 1977 who described his plans for her character: "The
mastectomy will fascinate my viewers, because it will be my third."</TE>
<TE>   "Search for Tomorrow" was extremely popular for its first
quarter-century, but lost ratings afterward until it was canceled by
CBS in 1982 and then by NBC after a disastrous four more years.</TE>
<TE>   Among the actors who got their start on the show were Barbara
Babcock, Kevin Bacon, Jill Clayburgh, Sandy Duncan, Morgan Fairchild,
Kevin Kline, Hal Linden, Don Knotts and Susan Sarandon.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in the final episode what she was searching for, Stuart's
undaunted Joanne offered a hopeful "Tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart was the first actress to be nominated for a daytime Emmy in
1962, and later added three more nominations. In 1983, she received a
Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences for her work on "Search for Tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Stuart started the New York chapter of the Screen Actors
Guild Foundation program Book PALS (Performing Artists for Literacy
in Schools), frequently reading to school classes herself. She also
started a reading club in six New York schools.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced twice, Stuart is survived by her husband of more than 20
years, Wolfgang Neumann; two children, Cynthia Stuart and Jeffrey
Krolik; and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations can be made to NYBookPALS, 5757 Wilshire Blvd.,
Los Angeles, CA 90036.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>AL West Isn't the Only Division on His Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>In his first visit to the Angels' spring training home Sunday, Paul
Pressler got a personal tour of the complex from Manager Mike
Scioscia and General Manager Bill Stoneman, watched an exhibition
game dressed in his shiny red team jacket and joked about whether
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner might allow him to devote all his
energies to running the Angels and Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   "I keep asking Michael if I can do this for my full-time job,"
said Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and resorts division and
the man temporarily entrusted with operating the company teams.</LD>
<LD>   While it might be fun for a corporate executive accustomed to
running theme parks, hotels and cruise ships to sit in on trade
talks--halting a proposed trade that would have sent outfielder Darin
Erstad to the Chicago White Sox for prospects, and directing Stoneman
to play to win this year--the Angels and Ducks are highly visible but
financially minuscule parts of Pressler's empire.</LD>
<TE>   Pressler's division accounted for $7 billion of Disney's revenue
last year. The Angels and Ducks accounted for about $150 million,
roughly two cents of each of those dollars.</TE>
<TE>   With the recession and the aftermath of Sept. 11 compelling Disney
to forecast declining attendance at its theme parks and the hotels
surrounding them, whatever Pressler can do to reverse those trends is
far more significant to the company then whether he can turn the
Angels and Ducks into winners. Pressler flew here for the afternoon
Sunday and flies to Paris next week for the opening of a second theme
park there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge portfolio of businesses I'm responsible for," he
said. "Ultimately, the teams deserve someone dedicated to them
day-to-day."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler decided last week that he would hire three senior sports
executives--a president to run both teams, replacing Tony Tavares,
who resigned Jan. 4, and a vice president of business administration
for each team. Pressler has promoted Kevin Uhlich, a longtime club
employee, to fill the vice president's position for the Angels and
will fill the other two positions from outside the current staff.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said he wants the new president to live in Orange County
and immerse himself in the community, have previous experience in pro
sports management--Tavares did not--and be "fiercely competitive." In
the meantime, Stoneman and Duck General Manager Pierre Gauthier will
address trades and other player issues directly with Pressler.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pressler's direction, the Angels kept Erstad and added
pitchers Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele and designated hitter Brad
Fullmer. They also signed all-star closer Troy Percival, who had
asked for a trade and vowed not to sign a contract extension with the
club, to a two-year extension.</TE>
<TE>   "The organization really made an adjustment and went after
winning," Percival said. "If this organization is going after
winning, this is where I want to be. Once Mr. Pressler stepped in and
made it known they wanted me back, that was where my focus was at.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to go to a winner. I did."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pressler: "These fellows are really pleased with the way the
clubhouse has come together, not just with the talent that has been
assembled but with the spirit and camaraderie. Part of being a
winning team is having that sense of purpose. We feel like we've got
a team to go out and win every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, our fans are excited with the players we've put out
there. Ultimately, it will take a bunch of wins for them to feel
great about coming out every single day."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels expect to sell roughly the same number of season
tickets as last year--about 13,000, fairly impressive given the
slumping economy and last season's finish of 41 games out of first
place. On the first day individual game tickets went on sale, the
Angels sold 5,000 more tickets than on the same day last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus, slowed last week by a jammed right
ankle, made his Cactus League debut Sunday and doubled in an 11-1
loss to Oakland.</TE>

<LD>Rick Ankiel still is having trouble finding the strike zone.</LD>
<LD>   Ankiel had a shaky start to his spring, allowing six runs in two
innings of the St. Louis Cardinals' 12-1 loss to Montreal on Sunday
at Jupiter, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Ankiel walked the first two batters on nine pitches and allowed
five runs and six hits, including a grand slam to Lee Stevens in the
first inning.</LD>
<TE>   "It was good to get out there and get it over with," Ankiel said.
"I just want to go out, be myself and have fun. I felt good, although
I was a little nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Ankiel, 22, whose wildness sent him back to the rookie ball last
year, threw 29 strikes and 17 balls in his first outing of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ankiel was one of the team's top pitchers as a rookie in 2000
before unexplained wildness set in during the playoffs. He spent most
of last season in the rookie Appalachian League, where he seemed to
get squared away. He was 5-3 with a 1.33 earned-run average and only
18 walks in 871/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols, last season's NL rookie of the year, has agreed to
a one-year, $600,000 contract with the Cardinals, with a $50,000
bonus if he makes the All-Star team. Last season, Pujols hit .329
with 37 home runs and 130 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. made his spring debut for Cincinnati, going 0 for
2 in a 5-4 win over Boston in Sarasota, Fla. He missed four games
because of a viral infection.... Jorge Posada is expected to resume
catching for the Yankees this week. He had been limited to designated
hitter duty after off-season shoulder surgery.</TE>

<LD>For the second season in a row, Woodland Hills Taft High is a

spring's meltdown in the state meet at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to be very focused to do well in the state
championships," sprinter Noah Smith said. "And you have to be even
more focused if you're the favorite."</LD>
<TE>   Taft won its second consecutive City Section title last year, but
the Toreadors' state-title hopes took a hit in the section meet when
senior Daniel Clements finished a non-qualifying fifth in the 1,600
meters after sustaining blisters and cuts on his left foot in the
section preliminaries while running most of his heat without a shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Clements' shoe came off about 300 meters into the race when a
competitor inadvertently stepped on the back of his foot.</TE>
<TE>   Things got worse for Taft on the first day of the state
championships when two-time state long jump finalist Chris Morgan
fouled on all three of his qualifying attempts; the Toreadors'
top-ranked 400 relay team finished a non-qualifying fifth in its heat
after a horrendous final exchange; Smith failed to qualify for the
final of the 100, and the 1,600 relay team was disqualified for
running out of its lane after apparently qualifying for the final.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan won his second consecutive title in the 110 hurdles the
next day and Smith placed sixth in the 200, but the Toreadors'
11-point total left them in 12th place, 17 points behind Arroyo
Grande.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get into our rhythm," Smith said of Taft's first-day
debacle at the state meet. "We sat down before the 1,600 relay and
talked about getting it going again. We started to pick it up again
in that race, but then we were disqualified."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan and Clements graduated in June, but the rest of Taft's top
performers return and the Toreadors have a talented transfer in
senior Justin Tryon.</TE>
<TE>   Tryon ran a career-best 48.02 seconds in the 400 for Littlerock
last season and is the fourth-fastest returning sprinter in the state
in that event.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a junior, is the No. 3 returner in the 200 with a best of
21.47 and is tied for 11th in the 100 with a time of 10.84.</TE>
<TE>   Taft returns three members from its 400 relay team that ran 41.21
last season and the Toreadors' entire foursome is back from a 1,600
relay squad that clocked 3 minutes 16.53 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Add Tryon to the mix and Taft has the potential to break 41 in the
400 relay and the school record of 3:13.21 in the 1,600 relay.</TE>
<TE>   Those times would make the Toreadors state-title contenders in
each race, but Smith knows nothing is guaranteed in the state meet.
Particularly in the sprints and relays where a botched baton pass or
a strained hamstring can end a team's championship dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe everything happens for a purpose," Smith said. "And I
believe last year was God's way of showing us what it takes to win a
state championship. I think what happened last year will help us this
year."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Miles Enjoys Role, Even Behind Fowlkes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darius Miles said at the start of the season that he was content to
play behind Clipper small forward Lamar Odom. Later, when Odom was
injured, he said he was satisfied to play behind Corey Maggette. Now,
with Maggette sidelined by injuries, he said he is perfectly
comfortable as Tremaine Fowlkes' backup.</LD>
<LD>   "It's my role," Miles said with a shrug.</LD>
<LD>   Miles and Quentin Richardson have excelled as the first
substitutes off Coach Alvin Gentry's bench this season. Gentry has
given up trying to figure out why Miles hasn't been as effective in
six starts. He hasn't bothered to start Richardson once.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, Miles had 18 points and five rebounds in 30 minutes
and Richardson added 17 points in 28 minutes during the Clippers'
victory Saturday over the Golden State Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Tremaine Fowlkes is a newcomer," Miles said of the former
California and Fresno State player expected to be signed to a second
10-day contract this week to bolster the roster because of injuries
to Odom and Maggette. "But, you know, he needed a chance. Me and 'Q',
we have our roles coming off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Miles paused for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year will be a whole different story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it would seem to be only a matter of time before Miles,
20, and Richardson, 21, become starters.</TE>
<TE>   "For this team," point guard Jeff McInnis said, "Darius and 'Q'
are more effective off the bench. They create energy when they get
into the game. They know their roles. It's better for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With 22 games left and his team on the outside looking in at the
top eight teams that will advance to the playoffs, Gentry discussed
the stretch drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody anticipated at the start of the season that 42
or 43 wins would get you into the playoffs," Gentry said. "I would
think now that 45 would be the minimum. When you see how it's going
now, it's not too different from last year when 48 was the eighth
seed."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are 30-30 and ninth in the Western Conference
standings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did not practice Sunday, but will today. They leave
Tuesday on a four-game trip to play Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland and
Minnesota. When it ends, the Clippers will have completed a stretch
in which they played 25 of 35 on the road.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Christensen Impresses, but Hits Sign-Language Barrier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>McKay Christensen couldn't have scripted a better performance to
begin building his case for the Dodgers' center-field and leadoff
jobs. Or so it seemed.</LD>
<LD>   Christensen, making his first exhibition start, tripled to
right-center field and scored in the first inning of Sunday's 9-8
victory over Florida. He singled to open the third inning, took third
on Cesar Izturis' single and scored on Paul Lo Duca's two-run double.
He led off the fifth with a perfectly placed bunt single.</LD>
<LD>   But when Manager Jim Tracy pulled Christensen aside after he
scored in the third, it was not to praise him for his aggressive
baserunning.</LD>
<TE>   "I missed a hit-and-run sign, and I can't afford to do that,"
Christensen said. "I can't miss any signs, but I especially can't
afford to miss a hit-and-run because that can waste an at-bat and a
baserunner. It's not good for both parties."</TE>
<TE>   These are the rookie-type mistakes coaches expect from a
26-year-old who has played in all of 95 big league games, but if
Christensen is to beat out Tom Goodwin, Marquis Grissom and Dave
Roberts this spring, he can't afford to make them. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, there is no excuse to miss signs," Tracy said. "If
the ability is there, things like that can help or hinder you in the
standings for who wins the job.... You can win or lose games with
miscommunication, and I don't like to see those things done
incorrectly. Those can kill you."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy believes Christensen has the physical tools to lead off, but
he needs to stay on top of the ball to avoid hitting too many fly
balls, and he needs to continue to improve his bunting and
base-stealing skills.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen, who hit .327 in 28 games for the Dodgers last season,
is out of options and will have to clear waivers before he is sent to
the minor leagues, so the Dodgers would risk losing him if he doesn't
make the club.</TE>
<TE>   He's also competing against two veterans (Grissom and Goodwin) who
will make a combined $8.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of factors involved in the decision, and salary
is one of the things you take into consideration," Dodger General
Manager Dan Evans said. "Our goal is to field the best team we can,
but luckily we don't have to make those decisions now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby took another step in his recovery from elbow surgery,
throwing a two-inning, 32-pitch simulated game, but there was nothing
simulated about a blistering Mark Grudzielanek line drive that almost
hit Ashby in the head.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost got killed out there," said Ashby, who ducked in time to
avoid the shot. "But that's good. It's a little reminder of how far I
have to go to get everything back to where I was before I got hurt. I
have to be ready to field the ball after I pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby gave up one hit in the first inning, but seven of his 16
pitches in the second were whacked for hits. Still, Tracy and
pitching coach Jim Colborn were happy with the way Ashby threw the
ball. Barring any setback, Ashby will make his Grapefruit League
debut Wednesday against Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have to wear a chest protector if I keep throwing the
ball over the plate like that," Ashby said. "My pitches were pretty
good out of the windup, but I scuffled out of the stretch. I've got
to get my timing down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, also recovering from elbow surgery, threw a 70-pitch
bullpen workout Sunday and is scheduled to throw a simulated game
Wednesday. If that goes well, he'll make an exhibition start this
weekend.... Outfielder Dante Bichette, a favorite to win a bench
spot, homered twice Sunday, and Brian Jordan and Izturis each had two
hits. Starter Hideo Nomo gave up one run and three hits in three
innings.</TE>

<LD>No, there's no grand conspiracy against the Lakers ... is there?</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the Kobe Bryant-Reggie Miller incident, several
Lakers say other teams are testing them or goading them, or beating
on them.</LD>
<LD>   "They were upset at Minnesota, the way [the Timberwolves] played
us at Minnesota," Coach Phil Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   "There were no foul calls in situations where Shaq [O'Neal] was
basically hammered by a couple guys at various times in the lane....</TE>
<TE>   "But what do you do about that stuff? There are 82 games, you just
have to play the season out and do the best you can and just go
through it, slog it out.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get calls, you don't get respect.</TE>
<TE>   "You earn it."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's roughneck play basically ended in the '90s when the
league began cracking down on hard fouls, instituting the flagrant
foul points system, putting a crimp in the plans of the Bad Boy
Pistons and Pat Riley's Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Having survived that, Jackson understands there's a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the league is going to allow people to just come
out and start hammering on guys to get 'em to fight. I mean, that's
what Detroit did 10 years ago. That's the way they played basketball
when they were at the top of the league. They'd wait until a critical
time and then up the ante all the time. That's the reason we have all
these retaliation rules in the first place, to stop that kind of
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the refereeing's good enough to measure that kind of
stuff. And I hope the league sees it as a warning sign."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Sacramento Kings stumbled to one of their worst performances
in an outstanding season, the visiting Indiana Pacers happily took
advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Jermaine O'Neal had 29 points and 11 rebounds as the Pacers shook
off Reggie Miller's suspension Sunday to win in the NBA's toughest
road arena, 97-86.</LD>
<LD>   Though the Pacers earned the victory with a strong fourth-quarter
rally and outstanding defense on Chris Webber and his teammates,
O'Neal and Coach Isiah Thomas both declined the credit for their
fifth consecutive victory over Sacramento, which had its worst
shooting game of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "We just seem to catch them at the right time," Thomas said. "When
you're 29-2 at home, the odds start working in the visitors' favor. I
feel bad for the next team that comes in here."</TE>
<TE>   Austin Croshere scored 19 points in a reserve role as Indiana
surprised the NBA-leading Kings without Miller, who served the first
game of his two-game suspension for fighting with the Lakers' Kobe
Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers responded with one of their best defensive games,
holding Sacramento under 35% shooting for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings made only 19 of 33 free throws, also their worst
percentage of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "All the other stuff aside, we make free throws, we win the game,"
Scot Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers broke the game open with a 21-7 run during an
eight-minute span of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Webber scored 13 points on two-for-16 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby had 19 points for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 116, Denver 110--Michael Finley scored seven of his 30
points in overtime, and Nick Van Exel added 20 points amid a constant
chorus of boos in his return to Denver as the Mavericks beat the
Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Raef LaFrentz, also traded with Van Exel, heard some boos when
introduced. He finished with eight points and three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Juwan Howard, sent to the Nuggets in the Van Exel trade, led
Denver with 30 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 107, Orlando 102--Courtney Alexander scored a
season-high 32 points as the Wizards, missing Michael Jordan and
second-leading scorer Richard Hamilton, broke a seven-game losing
streak by beating the Magic in overtime at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards had been 0-4 without Jordan, on the injured list
following knee surgery. In addition, Hamilton missed the game because
of a virus that sent him to the emergency room suffering from
dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady, who missed his first 10 shots, recovered to score
30 points for the Magic.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, New York 83--David Robinson moved within 12 points
of 20,000 for his career, and Tim Duncan had 25 points for the Spurs
at New York. Robinson had 13 points and 15 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 92, Chicago 84--Jason Collins had 17 points and matched
a career high with 12 rebounds, and Lucious Harris scored 16 points
in the fourth quarter to lead the Nets at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin picked up a flagrant foul in the third quarter, when
he tried to run through a pick set by rookie Eddy Curry. The flagrant
foul was Martin's sixth of the season, which will result in a
one-game suspension. He will miss Tuesday's game against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose led the Bulls with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 83, Charlotte 81--Jerry Stackhouse scored on a driving
layup with 3.7 seconds left--only the Pistons' third basket of the
fourth quarter--to lead a victory at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse had a game-high 28 points. Elden Campbell led Charlotte
with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 101, Cleveland 91--Glenn Robinson scored 28 points and
Ray Allen had 27 at Cleveland as the Bucks got a rare victory without
Sam Cassell.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks had been 1-6 this season without Cassell, the team's
third-leading scorer who sat out because of a sprained left toe.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 96, Memphis 71--Gary Payton had 20 points and 13 assists,
leading six SuperSonics in double-figure scoring at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Powell in Stanford's Rout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Stanford has been hard to beat under any circumstances this season.
The job becomes even more difficult when its best player has her best
day.</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore Nicole Powell, the consensus Pacific 10 player of the
year, poured in a career-high 37 points and had 14 rebounds to lead
the Cardinal past Oregon State, 71-55, before 5,585 in a conference
tournament semifinal at McArthur Court.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford (30-1), ranked second nationally and seeded No. 1 in the
tournament, plays Arizona State in the championship game tonight. The
winner gets the Pac-10's automatic NCAA tournament bid, but both
teams are expected to be in the field of 64.</LD>
<TE>   In a reflection of her season, Powell has seemingly done whatever
she has wanted to do in the Pac-10 tournament. She made 13 of 22
shots and all eight of her free throws Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, the 6-foot-2 forward outscored fifth-seeded
Oregon State by herself, 27-19. And she keyed the Cardinal's 18-3 run
at the end of the first half--including a three-point shot with less
than a second left--to raise Stanford's lead to 37-19 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Juleen Smith led Oregon State (16-14) with 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 64, Oregon 58--The third-seeded Sun Devils (23-8)
ended the surprising run of seventh-seeded Oregon in part because of
strong rebounding (39-31) and in part because the Ducks, playing
their third game in three days, seemed to run out of gas.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (17-13) didn't help itself by playing its worst half of the
season. Trailing, 31-19, after 20 minutes, the Ducks had almost as
many turnovers (18) as points.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, however, the Ducks tightened their 2-3 zone,
Arizona State grew hesitant, and Oregon went on a 24-4 run to go
ahead, 43-35.</TE>
<TE>   During a timeout Arizona State Coach Charli Turner Thorne
chastised guard Amanda Levens, the team's leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Levens, who felt ill and scored only three points in the first
half, responded, scoring 16 second-half points and keying an 18-4 run
that put Arizona State in front to stay. Shaquala Williams led Oregon
with 21 points.</TE>

<HD>Southland Teams Get a Top-Floor View</HD>
<DH>Prep basketball: Local boys' teams seeded No. 1 in four of
five divisions for regional playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southland boys' basketball teams, led by Westchester High in Division
I, were seeded No. 1 in four of the five divisions Sunday when
brackets for the Southern California Regional playoffs were released.</LD>
<LD>   The other top-seeded teams are Santa Ana Mater Dei in Division II,
Torrance Bishop Montgomery in Division III and Los Angeles Price in
Division V. San Diego Horizon Christian, the San Diego Section
champion in Division IV, was the only team outside the Southland to
be seeded No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The strong showing among Southland teams is no surprise,
considering the region's recent success. Bishop Montgomery and Price
are seeking their third consecutive state titles, while Mater Dei
looks for its second straight championship after winning the Division
I title last season.</LD>
<TE>   "[Mater Dei] is the favorite every time it takes the court in
California," Pasadena Coach Tim Tucker said Saturday after the
Monarchs beat his Bulldogs, 65-49, to win the Division II-AA title.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said top-seeded teams should be
leery of teams such as Pasadena that are coming off losses. Last
season, Corona Centennial rebounded from a loss to Mater Dei in a
section final to upset second-seeded Westchester in the first round
of the regional playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester (28-2), the City Section champion, plays another
section runner-up in the first round Wednesday when it plays host to
Thousand Oaks (27-4).</TE>
<TE>   The other first-round Division I matchups are equally intriguing.
Two Southern Section champions meet when Division I-A champion Los
Angeles Loyola (27-3) plays at Division I-AA winner Long Beach Poly
(28-3), the No. 3 seed. Rialto Eisenhower (27-3), which lost to Poly,
looks to get back on track when it plays at fourth-seeded Fresno
Clovis West (27-3). And second-seeded Fairfax (29-4), the City
Section runner-up, plays at Carlsbad (27-4), the San Diego Division I
champion.</TE>
<TE>   In the girls' brackets, Lynwood and Harbor City Narbonne were
seeded No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   The other top-seeded girls' teams from the Southland are Ventura
in Division II and Lakewood Artesia in Division III.</TE>
<TE>   Regional first-round games in the boys' and girls' brackets are
Wednesday, semifinals are Saturday and championships are March 16 at
Long Beach Arena and Long Beach City College. The state championships
are March 22-23 at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tucker, the Pasadena coach, voiced displeasure about playing a
Mater Dei team with players culled from all over the Southland.
"That's just basketball in Southern California," Tucker said. "I
guess we better lower the rent in Pasadena so we can get some more of
those type players." ...</TE>
<TE>   Total attendance at the Arrowhead Pond on Saturday for the
Southern Section boys' championships was 15,797, significantly less
than the 21,131 who attended in 2001....</TE>
<TE>   Catholic schools, which comprise a tiny fraction of the section,
went four for four in boys' championship games as Los Angeles Verbum
Dei, La Puente Bishop Amat, Loyola and Mater Dei all won.</TE>

<HD>CAA Votes to Draft Transfer Proposal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 45 high schools that comprise the Catholic Athletic Assn. voted
overwhelmingly last week to have a committee develop a new transfer
policy for membership consideration before the school year is
completed.</LD>
<LD>   Principals from a number of CAA schools have voiced support for
having students who transfer without changing residences be
ineligible for varsity sports for one season. The committee was
directed Thursday to come up with a proposal by early May, but it's
unlikely a policy could be put in place in time for the 2002-2003
school year.</LD>
<LD>   In similar development involving transfer rules, the City Section
Rules Committee will decide next week whether to recommend to the
Interscholastic Athletic Committee adoption of a proposal to make
athletes who transfer without moving ineligible for varsity
competition for one year.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson made it an even 40 with 40.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson topped the 40-point mark for the second game in a row and
40th time in his career, and the Philadelphia 76ers dealt the Toronto
Raptors their 11th consecutive loss, 96-84, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson scored 42 points, 24 in the second half, on 16-for-37
shooting for the 76ers, who won their third consecutive game.</LD>
<TE>   Iverson had 43 in Friday's victory over the New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson has scored at least 40 points seven times this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I've done before, it ain't a big thing," Iverson
said. "I'd rather give all those personal goals away to win a
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter, playing his fourth game since coming off the injured
list, had only 12 points for the Raptors, who are on their longest
losing slide in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto is closing in on the franchise record of 13 straight
defeats, set from March 20 to April 12, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't do anything on the offensive end, whether it was an
open shot or a free throw," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to cope with when the team is in this situation."</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors, booed throughout the game, have lost eight in a row
at home to fall to three games below .500 overall (29-32).</TE>
<TE>   Carter, guarded by Eric Snow, went three for 10 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Vince was struggling, but it is not just Vince. Snow had a lot to
do with it," Iverson said.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Coleman had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Snow added 11
points and seven assists for Philadelphia, which shot 51% from the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Snow said the time is right for the 76ers (30-28) to move up in
the standings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great opportunity to open things up and gain some
ground," Snow said. "These Eastern Conference teams are all
beatable."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis had 26 points for the Raptors, who made only 41% of
their field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bad. Don't get me wrong, this is very bad," Davis said.
"Is it rock bottom? No. There's still games."</TE>

<HD>Bozeman Sits at Important Time</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Only two days earlier, Cedric Bozeman's coach proclaimed he wouldn't
trade him for any point guard in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there Bozeman sat, banished to the bench in crunch time
against Oregon on Saturday. The Bruins would play out their hand with
Ryan Walcott at the point.</LD>
<LD>   Walcott delivered a solid performance in 16-second-half minutes,
playing excellent defense against Oregon's Luke Ridnour and knocking
down a three-point shot that gave UCLA its only lead of the second
half. But he also missed a three-point try that could have tied the
score with two seconds to play.</LD>
<TE>   Bozeman, a McDonald's All-American from Mater Dei High and UCLA's
most celebrated freshman since Baron Davis, bit his lip in the locker
room, not coming close to second-guessing Coach Steve Lavin's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be out there, but I've got to go with the flow and
just wait for Coach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman missed seven games after having surgery on his right knee
and has played in 18 games since returning Jan. 4. He made
significant progress in recent games, averaging 4.6 assists in his
last 10, culminating with eight assists in Thursday's victory over
Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   He also had cut down on turnovers, committing 11 in eight games
before turning the ball over four times against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Walcott, of course, is also improving, gaining confidence in his
jump shot and proving effective against small, quick opponents such
as Ridnour.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman and Walcott were both on the floor along with fellow
freshmen Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson and sophomore T.J.
Cummings for an entertaining seven-minute display of energy and
enthusiasm in the second half against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that Bozeman will move to shooting
guard next season, but with senior Ray Young and transfer Jon Crispin
becoming eligible, that is unlikely unless Bozeman's shooting vastly
improves. He is averaging 3.8 points on 42.4% shooting.</TE>

<HD>Zodiac-Diverse Trojans Are Seeking a Favorable Forecast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a good bet Derrick Craven's coaches and teammates at USC don't
address him as "Oh, Wise One," but given his astrology, they probably
should.</LD>
<LD>   The seldom-used freshman is a star-spangled, Cardinal-colored
astro-twin, the Zodiac equivalent of a three-point play.</LD>
<LD>   Craven and his brother Errick were born on the Fourth of July,
1983, under Cancer, one of three Cardinal signs whose dominant
quality is initiative. Though the Cravens have the same horoscope,
Errick (the better player) has taken on the most aggressive qualities
while Derrick has developed the receptive qualities, giving him
understanding and wisdom.</LD>
<TE>   Although he mostly sits on the bench cheering his teammates,
Derrick holds a strong sense of dignity, self-respect and personal
honor. He rarely allows others to see him disheartened and teammates
look to him for strength, encouragement and affirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Astrologically speaking, USC has a more diverse roster than UCLA,
with its water-logged legions of Aquarians and Pisceans. Six Zodiac
signs are represented.</TE>
<TE>   It stands to reason that Sam Clancy, the raging bull in the paint,
is a Taurus. Long-range shooter David Bluthenthal, like the Cravens,
is a ferociously proud Cancer.</TE>
<TE>   And Brandon Granville is a sociable Libra, the most desirable sign
for a point guard. Libra strives for balance, harmony and equality in
relationships, although a drawback is trying to please everybody at
any cost.</TE>
<TE>   With his feet on the ground and nose to the grindstone, it's safe
to surmise that Coach Henry Bibby has never given a moment's thought
to astrology. And reading his profile--a Sagittarius born Nov. 24,
1949--wouldn't change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "You appear gentle and soft, you have a strong need for emotional
security and a sense of belonging, and are deeply attached to the
past. You tend to cling to people and memories of personal or
sentimental significance. You approach life emotionally and
subjectively and are sensitive to the emotional atmosphere, the
subtle undercurrents of feeling in and around you."</TE>

<HD>Players Would Prefer Bruins</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While USC will be playing Stanford, a team it swept in convincing
fashion, in the first round of the Pacific 10 Conference tournament
on Thursday, the Trojans would rather face a team they split with in
the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   "[Stanford is] going to be gunning for us," senior forward Sam
Clancy said. "I'd rather play UCLA, to be honest."</LD>
<LD>   But why?</LD>
<TE>   "I think we owe [UCLA] one and I think Stanford's better," Clancy
said, matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Errick Craven pointed to the enmity between the
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd prefer to play UCLA," Craven said. "Especially with the
rivalry and the tournament being at Staples [Center], that would have
been a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   The only way the Trojans and Bruins can meet at Staples Center
this week is in the title game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When USC Coach Henry Bibby emptied his bench with 1:25 remaining
in Saturday's 79-45 victory over Oregon State, the Trojan lineup was
composed of three walk-ons--Joe Buck, Peter McCaslin and Anthony
Saadey--and freshmen Nick Curtis and Gregg Guenther.</TE>
<TE>   With time running down, Saadey was trapped at the top of the key.
Panicking, Saadey passed to ... Jerry Dupree, who was standing on the
Trojan sideline, eliciting a big laugh from the USC bench.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the stat sheet, you'd think Saturday's contest would be
one of those games Brandon Granville would just as soon forget--no
points on 0-of-8 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojan point guard, who was still recovering from flu, was
feeling nostalgic Saturday night after playing his final game in the
Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the times when you look back on when you're 40, 50
years old and remember the camaraderie of being on the team," said
Granville, USC's all-time leader in steals, assists, three-pointers
and games played.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Are Capitalizing on Rivalry With Mets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds silly, but this is New York, and New York teams don't do
silly.</LD>
<LD>   Yankee left-hander Andy Pettitte is in trouble because of his
son's baseball cap.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, a photographer snapped a picture of Pettitte and sons
Josh and Jared in the dugout at Legends Field in Tampa, Fla. Pettitte
thanked him and made sure to get a copy of the photo.</LD>
<TE>   Only one problem: 7-year-old Josh was wearing a Met cap. There was
a logical reason: Back home in Texas, he plays for a Little League
team called the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. The Yankees take their rivalry with the Mets very
seriously, and when the picture appeared in a local paper the next
day, the reaction was swift. "Apparently, someone was upset. I don't
know who," Pettitte said.</TE>
<TE>   Said General Manager Brian Cashman: "I was made aware of the
picture. I went to the player and inquired about the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Pettitte nor Cashman offered details, but it seemed clear
their talk took on a serious tone.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's a non-issue," Pettitte said.</TE>
<TE>   But not to everyone in the Yankee organization.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mystery man: Steve Jacobsen of Newsday, commenting on Sandy
Koufax, who showed up recently at the Mets' Port St. Lucie, Fla.,
training camp to counsel pitcher Shawn Estes:</TE>
<TE>   "Ballplayers like Koufax. He's open and expansive with them. He is
the patron saint of left-handed pitchers. Hall of famer is not a high
enough designation. He tells stories. And he has that mystique.</TE>
<TE>   "He's also highly skilled at avoiding crowds. Now the Mets were
playing 90 miles up the road and only a handful of onlookers and
eavesdroppers were around to recognize the lean fellow with the shock
of gray hair....</TE>
<TE>   "Hardly anyone knew Koufax would be there. 'It's like he'll appear
from the rain clouds,' Estes said. 'When he's done, he pulls his
Houdini act.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school did Oregon defeat when it won the first
men's NCAA Division I basketball championship in 1939?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The long wait: Gene Frenette in the Florida Times-Union: "The
newest power couple in sports is tennis star Martina Hingis and
golfer Sergio Garcia, which is proof that opposites attract.</TE>
<TE>   "In the time it takes Garcia to address the ball, Hingis can win a
match, talk to reporters, get showered and ready to go out on a
date."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No surprise: Reader Steve Abney to the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Scientists in the Siberian tundra have announced the discovery of a
perfectly preserved Neolithic hunter with some frozen artifacts
including a stone ax and Rickey Henderson's baseball card."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teen bell: Gold medal-winning figure skater Sarah Hughes will ring
the opening bell today at the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ohio State, by a score of 46-33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Base instinct: Barry Bonds, on his accomplishments last season:
"I've forever aimed for .500, reaching base in half of my at-bats.
Seventy-three homers was as much an accident as an accomplishment but
the on-base numbers (.515 in 2001) are what really thrilled me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dr. Wayne Isom, a cardiologist treating Jack
Nicklaus, 62, for high blood pressure, says the condition is not the
biggest threat to his career: "He's got the heart of a 20-year-old. I
can't say the same for his back."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Are Passive, Not Aggressive</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim manages only 17 shots and one goal, scoring
in the final seconds as Blackhawks hold on for a 2-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Stopping a losing streak for the Chicago Blackhawks was more
important to Steve Passmore than missing a chance for his first
shutout of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Passmore, a backup, was 37.1 seconds away from blanking the Mighty
Ducks, but he and the Blackhawks had to settle for a 2-1 victory
Sunday that kept Chicago from its first three-game losing streak of
the season.</LD>
<LD>   Passmore faced only 17 shots, and was finally beaten by the Ducks'
Matt Cullen from the crease with goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere off
for an extra attacker.</LD>
<TE>   In his eighth start and 14th appearance of the season, Passmore
was bidding for his third career shutout and first since Oct. 13,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The shutout is just one of those glory stats," Passmore said.
"The good thing is we've got guys who are ticked off every time we
give up a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we really kept the shots down, and anything they did get
came from the outside."</TE>
<TE>   After taking a 2-0 lead midway through the first period on goals 1
minute 54 seconds apart by Steve Sullivan and Eric Daze, the
Blackhawk defense took over.</TE>
<TE>   "We had lost two in a row, and we knew this was a big hockey game
for us," said Sullivan, who also had an assist. "We came out with
guns blazing."</TE>
<TE>   Daze's goal was his 30th. He has 30 goals for the second
consecutive season and for the fourth time in seven NHL seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have lost four of five following a six-game winning
streak, and have been held to one goal or none 21 times. Giguere made
25 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until the Olympic break we were going along pretty well," Duck
Coach Bryan Murray said. "Now we've come back, we're playing a
passive style.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't compete early at all in the game. The first penalty
kill didn't look like we were ready to start."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan opened the scoring with a power-play goal from the edge
of the crease at 9:07. He was set up by Igor Korolev's back-handed
pass from the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Daze ripped in a one-timer to complete a two-on-one at 11:01 to
make it 2-0. Daze was set up by rookie Tyler Arnason, his first NHL
assist.</TE>
<TE>   Passmore made tough saves midway through the second period when he
stopped Marty McInnis' 30-footer from the slot and Cullen's rebound
attempt.</TE>

<LD>A recap of the news while recovering from post-traumatic Olympic
security syndrome and wondering what marathon runners think about
during miles 2 through 23.</LD>
<LD>   News item: Austrian Hannes Trinkl wins important Alpine downhill
race in Norway.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: This is a huge story because Trinkl didn't even
make the cut for the mighty Austrian Olympic team, yet ... what's
that? The Olympics are over? They blew out the torch? The translators
have gone home? I don't have to write about Austrian ski racers for
another four years?</LD>
<TE>   Danke schoen.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Pacific 10 Conference men's basketball tournament
begins Thursday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I'm still not sure why ($$$$) they revived this
postseason tournament (ka-ching), because the Pac-10 managed
perfectly fine without one for more than a decade. Why wouldn't the
conference want to be aligned with the Ivy League ($$$$) as the only
league without a tournament? Contrary to some opinion, the lack of a
tournament hasn't hurt the Pac-10 in the NCAA tournament. The league
has boasted two national titles, UCLA in 1995 and Arizona in 1997,
while the Wildcats reached the title game last year.</TE>
<TE>   Why would the Pac-10 do this ($$$$)?</TE>
<TE>   Am I missing something here (ka-ching)?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Golfer Fred Couples proposes breakaway tour for
past-their-prime superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Listen, they've tested this concept with the NBA's
Portland Trail Blazers and it just doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   News item: The countdown begins toward ESPN's March 10 airing of
"Season on the Brink," the movie based on former Indiana Coach Bob
Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Interesting, isn't it, that a movie about an
educator has to come with parental guidance warnings. Strangely, ESPN
will broadcast an unexpurgated version of the Knight movie while
ESPN2 will air a tamer, toned-down version. ESPN was kind enough to
provide a sample snippet of how the two versions will differ.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN2 version: Knight: "Mr. Alford, would you be kind enough to
run the motion offense the way we worked on it in yesterday's
practice?"</TE>
<TE>   ESPN version: Knight: "Listen, you bleep, run the bleepin' offense
or I'll kick your bleep back to Bloomington."</TE>
<TE>   News item: House cleaners in Salt Lake City find blood transfusion
bags left behind by members of Austrian Nordic ski team.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I feel less embarrassed now about asking hotel
services to return the IOC-banned "Interesting Alpine story angles"
hypodermic blood-doping kit I left under the bed.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Fox plans boxing show pitting celebrity rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Paula Jones, substituting for Amy Fisher, will
square off against Tonya Harding in the featured bout. Fox is trying
to secure rights to Bob Toledo vs. Rick Neuheisel, Kobe Bryant vs.
Samaki Walker, Kobe vs. Reggie Miller, Kobe vs. Dennis Miller, Kobe
vs. Philadelphia, Kobe vs. Cable Guy, Kobe vs. Emanuel Lewis, Dennis
Miller vs. John Madden, Don King vs. Bob Arum and Scott Hamilton vs.
the French judge.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Rival students break right hand of Kentucky high school
basketball star to prevent him from playing in tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: A spokesperson for Tonya Harding says the
thug-skater was WAY too busy preparing for the Paula Jones fight to
have anything to do with the incident.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Basketball world commemorates 40th anniversary of Wilt
Chamberlain's 100-point game on March 2, 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: To pay homage, Philadelphia native Kobe Bryant
vows to throw 100 punches by season's end.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Salt Lake Games hailed as huge success.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This poll was obviously not taken Monday at Salt
Lake International Airport, where thousands of people waited in
hours-long lines to leave town.</TE>
<TE>   A gold medal ought to be awarded to the Boston Globe editor who,
facing a five-hour wait to check his bags, took a cab back to the
hotel and express-mailed his luggage to Boston, then hopped back in a
cab, returned to the airport and went straight to his gate.</TE>
<TE>   As innovative Olympic feats go, this move ranks up there with
Jonny Moseley's "Dinner roll."</TE>
<TE>   Citius!</TE>
<TE>   Altius!</TE>
<TE>   Fortius!</TE>
<TE>   Taxi!</TE>
<TE>   News item: John Madden leaves Fox to join ABC's "Monday Night
Football."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Here was the problem with Dennis Miller's
two-year, smart-act, sidekick stint. A man known for acerbic,
dead-on, no-holds-barred satire on his often wickedly funny HBO show
turned to mush after getting to meet his favorite players and coaches
during production meetings. Bottom line, it's a lot tougher to rip a
guy after he's autographed your ball cap.</TE>
<TE>   News item: ESPN investigative report reveals 40% of Duke
basketball players major in sociology as compared with only 2% of the
student body.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: We haven't seen this much favoritism accorded Duke
players since officials gave them a free pass during last year's NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Arkansas basketball Coach Nolan Richardson accepts
buyout from university.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Richardson has done more good than harm for the
sport, yet his rambling discourse this week was reminiscent of
Captain Queeg in the "The Caine Mutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but the strawberries!</TE>
<TE>   Richardson is right about the difficulties of being an African
American basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference. Then again,
the SEC's next black head football coach will be its first.</TE>
<TE>   News item: San Francisco Giant second baseman Jeff Kent breaks his
left wrist while washing his truck.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Witnesses say Kent injured himself while trying to
hit for the cycle (rinse).</TE>
<TE>   News item: Baltimore Ravens release quarterback Elvis Grbac the
same week Seattle Seahawks sign Trent Dilfer to a long-term deal.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The Dilfers need to clip and save this item and
file it in their scrapbook under "Hunk-a, Hunk-a Burnin' Justice."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Winter Olympics end in glory; U.S. economy shows sign
of recovery.</TE>

<HD>Els Finally Makes It Out of Woods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eight-stroke lead suddenly became Ernie Els' worst nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   It was bad enough that the Big Easy was having a difficult time
Sunday in the Genuity Championship at Miami. Worse yet, Els had to
watch Tiger Woods in the group ahead put on a dazzling display of big
drives and crucial putts, working the gallery into a frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   "He has wiped out leads like that before," Els said. "When he gets
on a roll, it's hard sometimes for him to hit a bad shot. It's not a
very comfortable feeling."</LD>
<TE>   At least this one had a happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   A duel that Els never wanted turned into a victory he desperately
needed on the Blue Monster at Doral when the 32-year-old South
African withstood relentless pressure to win for the first time in 18
months on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy," said Els, who closed with an even-par 72 for a
two-stroke victory over Woods. "A half-hour ago, I was still very
concerned about winning this tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The comeback was so swift and shocking that Woods had a 40-foot
eagle putt for a share of the lead on the 12th hole. He settled for
birdie, and he finally ran out of magic. He never made another
birdie, although he had three chances inside 15 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I made him work for it," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods closed with a 66, playing the final 42 holes in blustery
conditions without a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Els, who finished at 271 and earned $846,000, won for the first
time on the PGA Tour since the International in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, he was finally staring down Woods, even though
it was an occasion he could have done without. Els has finished
runner-up to Woods six times--three more times than any other player.</TE>
<TE>   There have been dramatic battles, such as Kapalua two years ago
when they matched eagles on the 18th hole to get into a playoff,
which Woods won with a 40-foot birdie putt. There have been blowouts,
too, such as Woods winning the U.S. Open by 15 shots and the British
Open by eight shots during his record-setting year in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But the one duel that came to mind Sunday was when Woods made up
an eight-stroke deficit in the final round and beat Els in a playoff
in the Johnnie Walker Classic at Thailand four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This would have been a difficult one to swallow," Els said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't buckle this time. Els made a terrific par save from 50
feet off the 14th green, and his swing held up under the pressure of
the final four holes, all of them two-putt pars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb won the women's Australian Open at Melbourne, beating
Norway's Suzann Pettersen on the first playoff hole.</TE>
<TE>   Webb and Pettersen, who were tied for first place after the third
round, each shot a three-under 69 for the second consecutive day to
finish tied at 10-under 278.</TE>
<TE>   Webb clinched the title with a seven-foot birdie putt on the first
extra hole.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alastair Forsyth of Scotland won his first professional title,
defeating Stephen Leaney of Australia on the second playoff of the
Malaysian Open at Kuala Lumpur.</TE>

<HD>Snow Ridge Completes a Triple With Grade I Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Successful in Grade III and Grade II stakes in his first two starts
in California, Snow Ridge completed the natural progression on Sunday
at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   The son of Tabasco Cat earned his first Grade I win with a
11/2-length victory over 19-1 shot Alyzig and four others in the
$150,000 San Carlos Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-1 shot when he won the El Conejo on New Year's Day and 8-1
when he surprised Squirtle Squirt in the Palos Verdes on Jan. 27,
Snow Ridge was the 3-5 favorite in the San Carlos when he won for the
ninth time in 18 starts under jockey Mike Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Bill Young's Overbrook Farm and trained by Wayne Lukas,
Snow Ridge became the first horse since Debonaire Junior 17 years ago
to win the Palos Verdes, El Conejo and San Carlos in the same meet.</TE>
<TE>   Lukas indicated after the colt's wire-to-wire win that he could
return in the $200,000 Potrero Grande Breeders' Cup Handicap on March
30 before heading east. If he doesn't run here, Lukas mentioned the
Commonwealth Breeders' Cup Handicap on April 14 at Keeneland and/or
the Churchill Downs Handicap on the Kentucky Derby undercard on May
4.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning his first Grade I was important," said Lukas, who had won
the San Carlos with Farma Way in 1991. "I think he is a quality
horse, but all these quality horses need to get it on their resume at
some point. Once you get it behind you, it is there forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Mr. Young and the Overbrook family today, 'We need to get
this. It's sitting out there in front of us and we need to jump on it
and get it.</TE>
<TE>   "What I liked about him was the way he relaxed through the first
half-mile. He wasn't rank for Mike or anything and Mike was cruising
up there [23 and 45 2/5 fractions for the first half-mile]. It may
give us a dimension to try something like the [Metropolitan Handicap
at one mile in May at Belmont Park] or something where he is going to
go a little bit further."</TE>
<TE>   Alyzig, the longest shot in the field and making his first start
on dirt, finished a length in front of Grey Memo, then came Stormy
Jack, Ceeband, the 2-1 second choice who raced coupled with
last-place finisher Hasty Kris.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending for Eddie Garcia, 49, who died Saturday night
of an apparent heart attack. Garcia was the agent for jockey Fernando
Valenzuela. Earlier Saturday, Valenzuela broke his left arm after
being unseated by Ceelinctive in the 11th race at Santa Anita. He is
expected to be sidelined several months. ... Parade Leader, a 10-1
shot, rallied from far off the pace and drew away late to win the
$500,000 New Orleans Handicap at the Fair Grounds. Owned by Will
Farish and E.J. Hudson and trained by Neil Howard, Parade Leader, a
5-year-old, covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:50 2/5 under jockey Corey
Lanerie.</TE>

<HD>Kobe or Not Kobe, the Lakers Still Win</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Playing without Bryant, who is suspended by
league for two games, O'Neal scores 36 points and L.A. routs Houston,
95-79.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when the Lakers were wondering what, or which of them, might go
wrong next, they had one of those nights you dream about.</LD>
<LD>   They won without Kobe Bryant, they moved within one game of West
leader Sacramento and they got their players off the floor without
incident.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal put on the suspended Bryant's No. 8 jersey for
pregame warmups and then put the Rockets to flight, rolling up 36
points in 34 minutes, to go with his 14 rebounds and seven assists as
the Lakers cruised to a 95-79 victory Sunday night before 18,997 in
Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, O'Neal played the game in his own No. 34, or they might
have had to revive him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my guy," he said of Bryant afterward. "I knew you [press]
would ask me questions about it and I knew they'd show it on every
channel so that's why I did it, to keep him alive."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was funny," said teammate Robert Horry of O'Neal's
tribute, "because I wanted to know how he was going to get his big
rear end into it."</TE>
<TE>   So Sunday ended better for the Lakers than it started. Before
their morning shoot-around, they learned that Bryant and Indiana's
Reggie Miller had each been suspended for two games for their fight
after Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant will also miss Tuesday's game here against East-leading New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big matchup for both teams," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said. "It appears they're going to be without [Kenyon] Martin
[suspended for a game because he's exceeded the flagrant-foul limit].
It's duly a fact that we're going to be without Kobe."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Rockets, who feature a slender front line,
when the Lakers are without Bryant, they have little choice but to
sock the ball in to O'Neal, time after time.</TE>
<TE>   On the Lakers' first possession, O'Neal made a short jumper. On
the second, he missed, got the rebound and dunked.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Rockets seemed to decide it would be a good
idea to contest this one at a distance. They launched 20 three-point
attempts, perhaps on the theory that each one they made counted more
than O'Neal's did, but they only made seven.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Shaq was going 15 for 21 from the field. Since he
rebounded most of his own misses, you can see what the Rockets were
up against.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't got the answer," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
"What makes him great, he moves the ball around. He gets guys layups.
It's got to be fun to play with him."</TE>
<TE>   It can't be much fun for players such as Kelvin Cato and Eddie
Griffin, who aren't much bigger than Horry, to try to keep O'Neal out
of the lane.</TE>
<TE>   "You just try to do everything you can to keep him from getting
it," Horry said. "You know, front him, do whatever you can. It's
hard. He's so good in there at times, when guys front him, that we
can read it, that we can get it to him any time we want to.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, you just hope he misses his shots....</TE>
<TE>   "I think he can get a lot better. Because right now, there's still
been a couple games where he hasn't been, you know, Shaq. He was Shaq
starting the game out against Indiana, because of certain
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think he's getting better and that's going to make us
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won six of seven, which isn't bad, given all their
personnel comings and goings.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he's going to come back with a different vengeance," said
O'Neal of Bryant, "and it's going to put us right back on track.
Everything happens for a reason.... He's going to want to show people
that they made a mistake, not him....</TE>
<TE>   "A man has to do what a man has to do. If the powers that be order
the powers below to control the game, then none of this would have
happened. The guy didn't start fighting just to be fighting. If you
let ... go on for eight or nine minutes, it's going to add up.</TE>
<TE>   "The people upstairs, instead of fining you for ... they need to
worry about the game and worry about what's really going on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying he's justified. I'm just saying a man's got to do
what a man's got to do."</TE>

<KH>17TH LOS ANGELES MARATHON</KH>
<HD>New Back-to-Back in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Men: Kenya's Ndungu becomes first male to take consecutive
titles in Los Angeles Marathon, clocking 2:10:27.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen Ndungu says he has a poor finishing kick, but there was
nothing wrong with the way he ran miles 18 through 23 in the 17th Los
Angeles Marathon on Sunday morning.</LD>
<LD>   It was during that stretch that the 34-year-old Kenyan ran six
consecutive miles at faster than five minutes per mile on his way to
his second consecutive victory in the men's division.</LD>
<LD>   Ndungu's time of 2 hours 10 minutes 27 seconds lowered his
previous best of 2:11:16 and made him the first man to win
consecutive L.A. Marathon titles.</LD>
<TE>   He earned $25,000 and a new car worth $25,300 from one of the
race's major sponsors for winning the race and $5,000 for breaking
2:11.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Kipkoech Chemwelo of Kenya placed second in 2:12:19 with
2000 champion Benson Mbithi third in 2:12:32.</TE>
<TE>   Sylmar native Peter De La Cerda was the first U.S. finisher,
placing seventh in 2:18:25. De La Cerda, runner-up in the 2000 U.S.
Olympic trials, had hoped to lower his career best of 2:15:11.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ndungu's time was the third-fastest clocking in L.A.
Marathon history, it came on a reconfigured 26.2-mile course that was
flatter than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good to be a two-time champion," Ndungu said. "I'm happy
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Ndungu ran 2:13:13 in winning last year's race by two minutes, but
it became clear early in Sunday's race that the winning time would be
substantially faster on the new course.</TE>
<TE>   With designated pacesetters Joseph Kariuki and Godfrey Kiprotich
setting the pace, the leading runners came through two miles in 9:53
and five miles in 24:30.</TE>
<TE>   Ndungu and Kipkoech Chemwelo were part of the seven-runner lead
pack at that point, but Mbithi was about 50 yards back in a second
pack.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the way I run," Mbithi said later.</TE>
<TE>   Mbithi caught up to the leaders a few miles later, as did Karl
Johan Rasmussen, a Norwegian with a best of 2:14:52.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders came through 10 miles in 49:23, an average of 4:57 per
mile, but it took them 5:25 to cover the next mile as they ascended a
hill after running on a downhill grade for much of the first 10
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Kiprotich dropped out of the race after leading the field through
the halfway point in 1:05:01 and Rasmussen began to fall off the pace
shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   The lead pack of Kariuki, Ndungu, Mbithi, Kipkoech Chemwelo and
Kenya's Noah Bor averaged 5:03 per mile for miles 14-17 before Ndungu
briefly opened a small lead after bypassing a water station at which
the others slowed to grab a drink.</TE>
<TE>   "That was tactics for a runner like me," Ndungu said. "It was a
chance to at least push the pace a little."</TE>
<TE>   Kariuki, Mbithi, Kipkoech Chemwelo and Bor caught up to Ndungu
over the next 200 meters, but the pack was reduced to four at 181/2
miles when Kariuki dropped out as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Ngundu, running with short, efficient strides, looked very relaxed
at that point while Kipkoech Chemwelo, Mbithi and Bor appeared to be
laboring.</TE>
<TE>   Bor, 24, fell off the pace shortly before 19 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Mbithi, 23, quickly followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Kipkoech Chemwelo, 23, ran with Ngundu for the next two minutes,
but then began to lose ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to stay close," Kipkoech Chemwelo said. "But it was
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Ngundu, who ran 4:54 for the 18th mile of the race and 4:47 for
the 19th, clocked 4:52, 4:58, 4:55 and 4:55 for the next four miles
while running by himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a poor finisher," Ngundu said about his decision to pick up
the pace in the 18th mile. "I do what I have to do to try and
separate myself from the others."</TE>
<TE>   Ngundu's pace slowed to 5:07, 5:10 and 5:05 in the final three
miles of the race, but his lead continued to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't bad," he said. "But I had some cramps. Little ones here
and there. When you get to the end, you are physically very tired."</TE>
<TE>   Mbithi, third in the L.A. Marathon the last two years, said
finishing times would have been faster, but a delayed start led to
warmer temperatures in the final miles of the race.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the race, scheduled for 8:45 a.m., was delayed for 28
minutes because the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad was
investigating a suspicious package found along the race route. The
package turned out to be of no danger, according to Police Chief
Bernard Parks.</TE>

<HD>Marlin Escapes Penalty to Win at Las Vegas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After only three races, it already has been a strange season for
Sterling Marlin.</LD>
<LD>   "We could be 3-0, but we could be 0-3. It's good to be here,"
Marlin said Sunday, when he won the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las
Vegas after NASCAR rescinded a 15-second penalty for speeding in the
pits because officials did not notify the team in time.</LD>
<LD>   "We communicated to the pit official that there be a 15-second
penalty and the pit official didn't hear it," NASCAR spokesman Jim
Hunter said. "He was told three times and the official said he didn't
hear it and neither did the officials on either side of him.</LD>
<TE>   "In these situations, we always rule in favor of the competitor
and that's what we did today."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said officials chose not to enforce the penalty on Marlin
after that because bringing him back in or meting out another penalty
would have been "too severe."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin was the hard-luck driver of the season until the race at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   He lost a chance to win the Daytona 500 when he collided with Jeff
Gordon late in the race, then was penalized for leaving his car and
trying to make a repair during a red flag.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Rockingham, N.C., he was forced to follow Matt
Kenseth across the finish line under a yellow flag after NASCAR chose
not to throw a red flag, which would have allowed him at least a shot
at the eventual winner.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR had been heavily criticized for not being consistent in its
decisions on when to use the red flag to ensure a competitive finish.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Marlin was leading after 120 of 267 laps when he slowed
to make a scheduled pit stop under the green flag.</TE>
<TE>   As he drove his Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge toward the pit entrance,
Jerry Nadeau banged into the rear of Marlin's car and sent it
skidding sideways. Marlin was able to recover and drive it into the
pits, but NASCAR said he had exceeded the 45-mph pit road limit and
announced he would be held for 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin finished a routine stop and immediately sped from the pits,
retaining the lead after all the lead-lap cars had made their stops.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'No, not again,'" Marlin said, referring to getting spun
out. "Daytona was a heartbreaker. At Rockingham, Matt had the best
car."</TE>
<TE>   As for Sunday's on-again, off-again penalty, the driver said he
didn't know about it until after the race.</TE>
<TE>   "The tach broke in the car and I really couldn't tell how fast I
was going down pit road," he said. "I thought we were going in right
and, when we left the pits, somebody came out in front of us and I
gauged off them going out."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he could have overcome the 15-second penalty, Marlin
grinned and said, "It was early in the race. We could have probably
been almost a lap down.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know; it wouldn't have helped."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart, driving a Pontiac, had what appeared to be the
strongest car in the 43-car field throughout the race and was leading
Marlin in the late stages.</TE>
<TE>   When Shawna Robinson, the only woman in the lineup, bounced off
the wall on Lap 231, bringing out the fifth of six yellow flags, all
the leaders made their final pit stops. Jeremy Mayfield and Rusty
Wallace each took only two new tires and beat Marlin out of the pits.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who led four times for a race-high 76 laps, also took
four tires. He came out of the pits in sixth and wasn't able to mount
another challenge.</TE>
<TE>   After the green flag came out again on Lap 237, Marlin steadily
reeled in Mayfield, taking second place from Wallace on Lap 244 and
finally passing Mayfield's Dodge to regain the lead on Lap 251.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Petty's car was hit from behind and spun on Lap 255, bringing
out the final caution flag, but nothing was going to stop Marlin this
time.</TE>
<TE>   The green waved for the final time on Lap 260 and the
silver-and-red Dodge pulled steadily away, beating Mayfield to the
finish line by 1.163 seconds--about 10 car-lengths.</TE>

<HD>Incident With Miller Has Left Bryant Boxed Into a Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If only Friday's night ugliness was about just one punch.</LD>
<LD>   If only the ramifications lasted just the length of the
suspension.</LD>
<LD>   It only this entire matter would go away in two games, allowing
the Lakers to return to the business of lacing their spikes and
sprinting after Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   But it won't.</TE>
<TE>   Because what happened Friday night is not about Kobe Bryant's
fist, but his head.</TE>
<TE>   He has changed.</TE>
<TE>   A sweet kid has grown into a sassy young adult. The smooth guy has
become a tough guy. Over his designer silk game, he has draped a
crusty leather jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Wonder Boy has sometimes become Wonder-What-On
-Earth-Is-He-Thinking Boy.</TE>
<TE>   After naming Bryant one of their three leaders this season, the
Lakers have benefited from many nights of Captain Courageous.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes, they have been stuck with Cap'n Crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night was one of those times.</TE>
<TE>   Confirming that the change in Bryant has not been all good.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal may have worn Bryant's jersey during
introductions before Sunday's 95-79 win over Houston.</TE>
<TE>   And Derek Fisher may have earlier said, rather incredulously, that
Bryant's running punch of Indiana's Reggie Miller on Friday was a
matter of self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   But here's guessing Laker bosses know better.</TE>
<TE>   For them to stay hot enough to win their third consecutive
championship, Bryant must chill.</TE>
<TE>   No more post-game punches to shut somebody up. Especially after
your team has already done that on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in respect to the team, I think it was a selfish thing to
do," Coach Phil Jackson said Sunday, publicly scolding Bryant with
words sharper than any jab.</TE>
<TE>   No more punches of teammates on busses over ... money? Remember,
Friday's incident came only eight days after Bryant punched Samaki
Walker on a bus in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened Friday, coming on the heels of the incident with a
teammate, makes you wonder what's on Kobe's mind," Rick Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   No more collecting seven technical fouls in two months, Bryant's
haul at the beginning of this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been very edgy all year," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wanted Bryant to become more of an emotional leader.
But they never bargained for this.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we were asking for ... and now that we get it, we're
concerned?" asked Fox with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Well, um, yes.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday night, Bryant had not explained Friday's actions,
avoiding the media in tough situations as he has done several times
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, however, issued a statement that included this cryptic
line.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe has other issues he has to deal with. They had nothing to do
with me or the basketball game played Friday evening."</TE>
<TE>   That could be simply more trash talk.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe Miller, for all his blather, has also noticed a change.</TE>
<TE>   We're not going to play pop psychologist here. Bryant will
eventually speak for himself.</TE>
<TE>   But he already spoke to the team about Friday's incident.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he didn't condone what he did, but he also said, 'I had
to stand up for myself, stand up for my teammates,'" recalled Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly words endorsed by Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was apologetic," Jackson said. "He said, 'I did
what I had to do.'"</TE>
<TE>   But did he?</TE>
<TE>   Did slugging Miller do anything for him or the team?</TE>
<TE>   "I think you let your play do your talking for you," Jackson said.
"We won the game. Enough said."</TE>
<TE>   And about this so-called, strangely elusive "respect?" The word
which some Lakers have used in this case, and as an excuse for every
sort of on-court tussle in a season increasingly marred by them?</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get respect, you earn it," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was asked whether he understood why Bryant attacked
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was asked whether the team was satisfied with Bryant's
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say everybody's happy that he's missing the games,"
Jackson said. "No one's all right with that."</TE>
<TE>   While it was written here that O'Neal's sucker swing at Brad
Miller in January was equally unjustified, the Lakers are looking at
this different.</TE>
<TE>   They saw O'Neal in the context of, it was the first and probably
last serious incident of his career.</TE>
<TE>   They look at Bryant in the context of, what's next?</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely trying to set a tone about what he's all about,"
said Fox. "He sees himself as the best in the league, and in his
mind, that carries a lot of weight, draws out a lot of challenges."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest one apparently being, self control.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers play host to the New Jersey Nets on Tuesday in a
possible NBA finals preview, their best finals-type player will not
be there.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, stopped cold by Reggie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Changes, indeed.</TE>

<LD>When Eric Sisley was stealing from his family and local stores to buy
booze and crystal meth, when he was sleeping in a ratty tent in the
Arroyo Seco or in Pasadena dumpsters or sneaking onto the patio of
his father's house, tiptoeing through a door his little brother left
open late at night, Sisley didn't understand discipline, wasn't into
learning, didn't care about boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   Sisley could barely get from morning to afternoon to evening.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Sisley ran in the 17th Los Angeles Marathon.</LD>
<TE>   Not much more than a year ago Sisley, 30, of Pasadena, was
desperately alone and sadly afraid. He had been awarded a good start
in life, received a middle-class upbringing in Pasadena, had a
brother and sister and parents whose love was always available. He
went to a private high school in Indiana after he found public school
in Pasadena unfulfilling. He went to college, twice. He had jobs,
good jobs, and had started a promising career in the Marine Corps. He
was interested in the fine arts. He loved the stage and working with
stained glass and being a carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   And he had so little faith in himself, such a gaping wound in his
soul that he almost blew his life. Almost.</TE>
<TE>   Sisley got kicked out of Miami University in Ohio. He lost jobs.
He stole from his family and strangers. When he couldn't pay his
bills--not the phone or gas or heat or rent--he walked onto the
streets of Pasadena with a backpack, small change and little hope.
That was about 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning Sisley, a tall man with pale skin and a thin, blond
ponytail, stood at the corner of First and Grand. It was 7:30 a.m.,
90 minutes before the start of the Los Angeles Marathon. He was eager
to get going. Sisley had a goal, to break 3 hours 10 minutes, the
qualifying time for the Boston Marathon, although it won't be in time
for the 2002 race.</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to Sisley was Terry Dunbar, a 62-year-old from La
Crescenta.</TE>
<TE>   From appearances, Sisley, with his flowing hair and sweet nature,
and Dunbar, a clean-cut owner of his own business, seem unlikely
buddies. They wouldn't be able to run together on this day--Dunbar
was going to complete the 5K portion of the marathon--but they
wouldn't consider not being together at the start.</TE>
<TE>   Dunbar and Sisley met last year at the Bishop Gooden House in
Pasadena. Bishop Gooden is a place where men who have
problems--addictions, demons--come to live and heal. Dunbar's family
had ganged up on him. He was a drunk they told him and he needed
help. "They did an intervention," Dunbar says. "And I almost fought
them. But I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Sisley had gone on his own to Bishop Gooden a few years earlier
but had walked out when he wanted more drugs. There was, though, a
spark in Sisley. He was tired of living as a bum, of doing wrong and
having no one to talk to or lean on. His family had told him to stay
away until he straightened up. His younger brother, Damien, had tried
to help, leaving doors open at night, letting Sisley sneak in, but
Damien got caught and Sisley had no one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd gotten a construction job and had $400 in my pocket," Sisley
says. "I was so tired of being dirty and alone. I walked back to
Bishop Gooden. I gave them my $400, and they let me stay."</TE>
<TE>   One night Sisley got in line for dinner and found himself behind a
man wearing an L.A. Roadrunners jacket. The man was Dunbar. "Do you
run," Sisley asked Dunbar. "Yes," Dunbar said. "Do you?"</TE>
<TE>   Sisley had been a cross-country runner as a teenager. Dunbar led a
group of men in walks and runs at Bishop Gooden. Sisley asked if he
could come along.</TE>
<TE>   There was something about Sisley, about his quiet earnestness,
about the way the tall, lanky man with the dreamy eyes was always on
time and always eager to start the evening runs that touched Dunbar.
Maybe it was because Dunbar's son had been hurt badly by his father's
inability to put alcohol aside and now preferred to keep his distance
from his father. Maybe Sisley offered Dunbar a chance to make up, in
some way, for the hurt he had caused his own family.</TE>
<TE>   Dunbar noticed, on the first night Sisley came to run, that Sisley
had only a single pair of tattered, worn, barely functional running
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Eric that night," Dunbar says, "that I'd buy him a new
pair of shoes, but that if he ever relapsed, he had to give me those
shoes back."</TE>
<TE>   "I still have the shoes," Sisley says.</TE>
<TE>   The shoes are worn and tattered and barely functional as racing
shoes but eminently functional as a talisman, as proof Sisley has
turned his life around.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 13, Sisley celebrated his one-year anniversary of newfound
drug-free, alcohol-free life. Every day he talks to Dunbar. Several
times a month they run together.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Sisley, Eric's mother, says that she will always be
grateful to Dunbar. "Eric's friendship with Terry, and vice versa,
has been a critical component of both their recoveries," Christine
says. "It is very special. Eric's running is also his passion, his
antidote and his lifeblood, and Terry helped him find that love of
running again."</TE>
<TE>   Eric calls drugs "an ugly monster." He doesn't quite know how
things got so out of control. "I was in college, doing stuff a lot of
other people did," he says, "and then I just kept going and didn't
stop."</TE>
<TE>   Sisley is enrolled at Pasadena City College and is aiming for a
degree in fine arts. He is a freelance carpenter and lives in an
apartment with a friend. He ran in the Long Beach Marathon five
months ago and finished in 3 hours 21 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The last few hundred yards of the L.A. race were run on Hope
Street. Sisley, at 6 feet 3 a towering figure amid the field,
sprinted to the finish line. As he crossed under the big Los Angeles
Marathon banner, a few minutes behind Herlinda Xol, a 29-year-old
from Guatemala who ran in her bare feet, Sisley wobbled a little,
then lifted his arms high.</TE>
<TE>   His time? Three hours 10 minutes 22 seconds, a personal best by
nearly 11 minutes. A time of hope, in a race of hope, didn't finish
on the street called Hope, though. It just began.</TE>

<HD>Kite Victorious in Playoff</HD>
<DH>Golf: He beats Watson, who made long chip shot on final
regular hole, on second extra hole of SBC Senior Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The winds calmed down and the drama picked up on the final day of the
$1.45-million SBC Senior Classic on Sunday at Valencia Country Club
in the Santa Clarita Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Watson made a chip shot he said was from 123 feet for an eagle
on the final hole of regulation that put him into a playoff with Tom
Kite, which Kite won with a par on the second hole.</LD>
<LD>   Kite, who earned the $217,500 first prize to push his season
earnings to $608,600, was on a roller coaster ride all day.</LD>
<TE>   "Wow, that was a wild and woolly one," he said. "That was quite a
soap opera we played out there."</TE>
<TE>   After a birdie on the 12th hole put Kite up by two strokes at
five-under par for the tournament, he double bogeyed the 13th hole
and bogeyed the 15th before salvaging a 69 with birdies on two of the
final three holes of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's chip shot with a nine-iron on the final hole of
regulation, a 546-yard par-five, happened shortly after Gil Morgan
came within an inch of making a double eagle that would have put him
in the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Morgan finished tied for third with Tom Purtzer, who got
up and down from a greenside bunker on 18 for a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Kite and Watson finished 54 holes at four-under 212. Watson, who
had a two-stroke lead at the start of the day, shot a 71.</TE>
<TE>   Purtzer, the first-round leader, and Morgan finished at 213. No
one else in the field of 78 golfers finished at even par or better,
as gusty winds that at times exceeded 30 mph sent scores soaring
during the first two days.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Johnson, a qualifier who came into the  final round tied for
third and played with Kite and Watson in the final threesome,
struggled to a 76 and finished in a tie for eighth.</TE>
<TE>   After Purtzer and Morgan finished their rounds, they stood side by
side waiting to see how Watson and Kite did on the final hole and see
if they would be in a playoff. "Your shot just went from the best of
the day to the second best of the day," Purtzer told Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   However, later Purtzer was raving about Morgan's near double
eagle. Morgan was about 270 yards from the hole and his three-wood
missed dropping in by an inch as it rolled past about three to four
feet. "In my 27 years of golf, that's the best shot I've ever seen,"
Purtzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bullet right at the flag. I'm a big fan of Gil Morgan,
and he never fails to amaze me."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kite, he hit a perfect tee shot at 18. His second shot
rolled to the back fringe, stopping at the first cut of rough.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't an easy shot to begin with, and after Tom's chip shot
it got even tougher," Kite said.</TE>
<TE>   Kite's chip of about 25 feet left him with a five-foot birdie
putt, which he made.</TE>
<TE>   He had also made a five-foot putt at the 17th to save par after
his second shot took a bad bounce and went off the back of the green.</TE>
<TE>   Although the playoff lacked the drama that occurred on the final
hole of regulation, there were still some anxious moments.</TE>
<TE>   On the first hole of the playoff, the 18th, a 40-foot birdie putt
by Kite stopped a fraction of an inch short.</TE>
<TE>   Then Watson missed a five-foot birdie putt.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to go left and I just missed it right,"
Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   On the second playoff hole, the 470-yard par-four 10th, Watson hit
his tee shot into rough on the right and was left with a downhill
lie. His second shot left him about 20 yards short of the green and
after his approach shot he missed a seven-foot putt.</TE>
<TE>   Kite two-putted for par and the victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was Kite's second Senior Tour victory of the year and fifth
since joining the tour in 2000. His other victory came at the
Mastercard Championship in Kona, Hawaii, the first tournament of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   For his victory Sunday, Kite earned 218 points in the season-long
Charles Schwab Cup competition and took over the lead from Hale
Irwin. Kite has 606 points, Irwin 493 heading into this week's
Toshiba Senior Classic at Newport Beach Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Watson has had quite a few amazing shots in his career, including
his chip shot at 17 at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open when he
beat Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to rank Sunday's chip, he said, "It definitely ranks in my
top five."</TE>
<TE>   So where does the chip at Pebble in '82 rank? No. 1?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to tell you," he said with a smile.</TE>

<HD>All Signs Are Discouraging for Bruins</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Finally, UCLA's erratic play can be
explained. Team's astrological mix is awful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From her Martha's Vineyard hideaway on the other side of the country,
the answer was clear as a starlit night to astrologer Arlan Wise.</LD>
<LD>   The question came from reporters and was directed at UCLA
basketball players Dan Gadzuric, Billy Knight and Rico Hines.</LD>
<LD>   Why, oh why, are the Bruins so maddeningly inconsistent?</LD>
<TE>   True to their Zodiac sign, the players tossed out inventive,
vaguely intellectual replies. They are psychically intuitive, these
Aquarians, but their excessive detachment and inclination to retreat
from society make it difficult to provide concrete solutions.</TE>
<TE>   The exasperated reporters moved on to guard Ryan Walcott, another
obstinate yet progressive Water Bearer, but his comments were
deliberately crafted to soar above the grasp of the prying media.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jason Kapono, still another Aquarian, spiced his
elliptical ruminations on the state of the Bruins with surfer lingo.</TE>
<TE>   During games, these five Aquarians are occasionally on the floor
all at once, a development that causes Wise to make like a UCLA
season-ticket holder and slap her forehead in dismay.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Zodiac] rules your essential personality, your ego and your
willpower," said Wise, vice president of the Organization of
Professional Astrologers. "Overly weighting a team with any one sign
will have a profound effect on the group behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Now, some people don't believe in astrology, dismissing it as new
age mumbo-jumbo. But every other attempt at explaining the
unpredictable nature of the Bruins has failed.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, even the players are open to using the stars as a
guide and the planets as something of a crystal roundball.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a ton of meaning there," Kapono said. "It's quite
possible that's the answer to our problems."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it appears a perfectly reasoned explanation for the Bruins'
pogo-stick season--eight consecutive weeks of one win, one loss--has
been there all along. Just look toward the stars.</TE>
<TE>   The birthdays of nine Bruins are clustered into nine weeks, from
Jan. 20 to March 23. The five Aquarians include three
starters--Gadzuric, Kapono and Knight. The other starters, Cedric
Bozeman and Matt Barnes, are Pisces, which follows Aquarius on the
Zodiac calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Is that why Bruin followers carp at Coach Steve Lavin for uneven
recruiting and bizarre substitution patterns?</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't he consider the cosmic consequences of birthdays?</TE>
<TE>   "Nope," he said. "Never have."</TE>
<TE>   Had he consulted an astrologer--calling them "astrologists" risks
their cosmically connected wrath--Lavin would know that filling a
roster with Aquarians and Pisceans can be especially combustible.</TE>
<TE>   Wise said athletes born under those signs like to make up the
rules as they go along. They believe in team spirit and sharing the
ball, but do not always play to win.</TE>
<TE>   The water-bearing Aquarius and fish-symbol Pisces are more
comfortable playing water polo than basketball. And players under
both signs are susceptible to foot and leg injuries--like the ones
that plagued Bozeman, Barnes and Gadzuric this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Aquarius is an intellectual sign. Aquarians are stubborn and
unpredictable, but they are team players," she said. "It is a sign of
futuristic thinking. Great inventors are Aquarians."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what Lavin means when he says the team is constantly
re-inventing itself.</TE>
<TE>   Piscean athletes are susceptible to playing to the level of their
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "They are sponge-like, and when playing a highly competitive team
they will become much more competitive," Wise said. "I once had a
Pisces say, 'When I'm with you, I'm you. And when I'm with others,
I'm that person. I never know who I am.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's all starting make sense. The Bruins defeated No. 1 Kansas
because Bozeman identified with savvy Jayhawk point guard Kirk
Hinrich, Barnes with rugged forward Drew Gooden. And when UCLA was
upset by Pepperdine, Villanova and Arizona State, Bozeman and Barnes
mirrored their less-talented opponents and paid the price.</TE>
<TE>   Peppering a roster with Aquarians and Pisceans has far-reaching
implications. The 2,150-year long Age of Pisces is coming to a close,
leading to the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, as anyone who saw the
musical "Hair" knows.</TE>
<TE>   "It is this motion that we use to measure the cycle of World
Ages," astrology expert and author Ed Perrone writes. "Our physical,
emotional, and mental bodies are still molded according to the
Piscean energies, making the Aquarian influence virtually alien to
the dominant aspects of our natures."</TE>
<TE>   Although his comments bear an uncanny resemblance to one of
Lavin's post-game news conferences, Perrone is undoubtedly suggesting
that when the Bruins abandon their motion offense as the shot clock
winds down, it is difficult for Aquarians Kapono, Knight and Gadzuric
to get an open look.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins no doubt need to mix in a few forceful players born
under Fire signs--Leo, Aries and Sagittarius. Or, at the risk of
getting too technical, a player born under a fire sign in the aspect
of Mars, the planet of passion, action and athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Wilt Chamberlain, for example, had ideal astrology. Mars was in
the sign of Leo when the late basketball great was born August 21,
1936, at 11:27 p.m. EDT, giving him a double dose of lion-like
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 10 players in Lavin's rotation, only Andre Patterson and
T.J. Cummings are untainted by Aquarius or Pisces characteristics
(freshman Dijon Thompson's birthday is March 23, putting him on the
cusp of Pisces and Aries). Patterson is a Taurus, whose strong-willed
nature accounts for his steadfast rebounding and shot-blocking.
Cummings is a flexible yet practical Virgo, which also happens to be
Lavin's sign.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the coach cares a whit.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never considered astrology except to read my horoscope on
Sundays," he said, amused that anyone would consider explaining hoops
by connecting planets, moons and stars like so many X's and O's.</TE>
<TE>   Typical aristocratic Virgo, projecting purity and innocence while
Rome burns around him, more attentive to the creases in his slacks
than to the abundant astrological truths at his fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin players and coaches say they can tell five minutes into a
game whether the capricious team is going to play well. Alas, by then
it is too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Zodiac offers a more pragmatic course, a star map of what's in
store today, tomorrow and during March Madness.</TE>
<TE>   Let's take a peek at the Bruins' March horoscope.</TE>
<TE>   For Aquarians: "Speed and efficiency are the most important
elements of your routine. Someone could try to negatively influence
you, so be sure to stick to your own game plan. You aren't afraid to
push your body to its limits on the seventh or eighth [that's the
first two days of the Pac-10 tournament!].</TE>
<TE>   "Your work and personal schedules become full on the 14th through
the 18th [during the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament!]. Look
for your metabolism to speed up and your energy level to rise on
these days.</TE>
<TE>   "Maintaining proper eating habits is a must the week of the 20th
through the 26th [during the NCAA regionals!]. Fatty foods may seem
to go straight to your problem areas."</TE>
<TE>   Well now. If it all comes true, by month's end at least five
Bruins will be fat and happy. Could that mean UCLA in the Final Four?</TE>
<TE>   That's when astrological charts say Pisceans are ready to step up:
"March 30 [the day of the semifinals!] is a 'green-light day.' Lucky

<HD>Stop the Killer Compost</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it "Attack of the Killer Compost." Something is wilting
tomatoes, squeezing the life out of them like ketchup bottles at an
all-night diner.</LD>
<LD>   Will Hollywood bite? More important, will the California
Integrated Waste Management Board? The real-life version that tops
the marquee at the board's meeting Wednesday is, if not scarier,
certainly more serious.</LD>
<LD>   Compost samples in San Diego and, most recently, Los Angeles have
tested positive for traces of clopyralid, a weed killer ingredient
that also kills or stunts tomatoes, potatoes, sunflowers and certain
other garden goodies. Unlike many other herbicides, clopyralid
survives the high temperatures that turn grass clippings and other
plant debris into soil-like compost. Compost made from
clopyralid-treated clippings could kill gardeners' crops--and the
market for recycled green waste.</LD>
<TE>   Only a few compost samples have tested positive in California so
far. No plants are known to have been inadvertently killed, as
happened in Washington state. By acting now California can still
prevent contamination. But act it must, given the approach of
Southern California's high mowing season and clopyralid's popularity
with lawn care companies.</TE>
<TE>   Recycling green waste is a big deal in California because it
reduces the amount of garbage sent to landfills. Ten years ago
Sacramento began requiring cities and counties to divert 50% of their
waste from landfills or face fines as high as $10,000 a day. Los
Angeles diverts 55%, much of that through curbside collection of
2,000 tons of yard clippings a day, which trucks take to city
composting centers.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the rising alarm, clopyralid's manufacturer, Dow
AgroSciences, is researching ways to speed the chemical's breakdown
in composting. Until Dow has results, the waste board should urge the
state Department of Pesticides to follow Washington state's lead in
issuing emergency regulations banning the use of herbicides
containing clopyralid on residential and commercial lawns and golf
courses. Homeowners should check the ingredients in their garden care
products, and businesses should ask their lawn care companies not to
use the chemical. Dozens of products contain clopyralid, including
Confront, Battleship, Chaser Ultra, Millennium Ultra, Momentum,
ProScape and Strike Three Ultra.</TE>
<TE>   Before allowing new herbicides on the market, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency should conduct tests to confirm that
the products break down before they can cause toxic contamination
problems in compost.</TE>

<LD>Wilderness is or it is not. There is no mostly wilderness with just a
little bit of development.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush says the United States can pursue energy
independence and still protect the environment. No, it can't. Not by
drilling for oil in a 1.5-million-acre slice of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge on the north coast of Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate, shadowed by the Enron scandal, will debate the
nation's energy future over the next two weeks. It is a complex issue
that also involves energy conservation, auto mileage standards,
renewable energy and incentives to energy companies. For
Californians, the Senate needs to eliminate or modify a proposal that
would require motorists to use ethanol as a gasoline clean-air
additive in place of  MTBE, a powerful water pollutant. But
nationally, Arctic drilling is issue No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   No matter what Vice President Dick Cheney says, U.S. energy
security does not depend on drilling for oil in the Arctic refuge.
The Alaskan oil would not come on line for at least 10 years. Even at
peak production in 2027 the refuge would produce no more than 2% of
the nation's daily consumption. In addition, the refuge is hardly the
only place to find more oil. A major company has discovered three
large oil and gas fields within the 23-million-acre National
Petroleum Reserve, to the west of the refuge. The Clinton
administration offered 4 million acres of the reserve to the oil
companies. More can be leased.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is rushing exploration and drilling
programs in the lower 48 as well, often with poor consideration of
environmental consequences. Exploration trucks are tearing up desert
lands adjacent to Arches and Canyonlands national parks in Utah.
Federal agencies are preparing to allow the drilling of 40,000
coal-bed natural gas wells in northeast Wyoming, a process that
wastes an estimated 12,000 gallons of water daily from each well.</TE>
<TE>   There is no easy fix that would free the United States from
imported oil, which provides about 60% of the 20 million barrels
consumed daily.  The fastest way to gain more energy security is to
use less oil and use it more efficiently. Congress could cut gasoline
consumption 20% by setting lower but still-reasonable auto mileage
standards, far offsetting any Arctic oil production. The Senate
should end the special classification for gas-guzzling pickup trucks
and sport-utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate faces a major choice--the House-passed HR 4,
essentially President Bush's energy plan, emphasizing more
development of domestic oil and gas, or Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle's S 517, which provides more diversity of energy sources,
with greater emphasis on efficiency (including auto mileage
standards) and renewable energy. The Daschle bill is better for the
environment, air quality and the economy, though perhaps not for
oilmen.</TE>
<TE>   The nation doesn't need a muscle-bound  energy policy, it needs a
smart one--one that does not rely so heavily on fossil fuels and
fossil thinking.</TE>

<LD>Picture it: Teachers unions giving a thumbs up or thumbs down on
every decision about which textbooks to use in the public schools,
about whether Dickens is to be covered in English and about whether
students are to learn multiplication tables or fuzzy math. Gov. Gray
Davis and the  Legislature should stop this power grab by the state's
largest teachers union, an action that threatens statewide school
reform.</LD>
<LD>   A bill proposed by the California Teachers Assn. would require
school districts to negotiate with the local union before making
basic decisions now in the hands of the state, the local school board
and the superintendent. These choices should not become bargaining
chips in hardball labor talks. They should continue to be set by the
Legislature, the state Board of Education and local districts with
recommendations from others including teachers and parents.</LD>
<LD>   Contract talks, never a pretty sight in the Los Angeles Unified
School District, take place with an us-against-them tone behind
closed doors. It's debatable that this is the best way to set teacher
salaries, raises and benefits; applied to academics, it would be a
disaster.</LD>
<TE>   Davis should protect California's students by coming out against
the bill and asking his fellow Democrats, all friends of the
California Teachers Assn., to join him.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, AB 2160, is not about respect for teachers, as its
sponsors, Assemblywomen Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) and Virginia
Strom-Martin (D-Duncans Mills), suggest. It's about giving teachers
veto power over just about anything in a classroom. The measure
wouldn't lead to better cooperation between labor and management. It
would make it even harder to change what goes wrong in the classroom,
which is why school superintendents like the LAUSD's Roy Romer and
Sacramento's Jim Sweeney oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   If textbooks are put on the bargaining table, would older reading
teachers push for a return to the whole-language approach to
instruction although scientific research has proved that
phonics-based lessons are key to reading success for most children?</TE>
<TE>   Or how about this educational innovation, brought to us by the
teachers union in Los Angeles: For years, the LAUSD contract gave
teachers the right to choose their classroom assignments based on
seniority. A veteran teacher who had never taught reading could bump
a junior teacher who excelled in the subject. When that happened,
children lost. The current contract takes back some of that
authority, but teachers still have much more clout than principals or
students.</TE>
<TE>   Unions are supposed to put their members first. It's up to Gov.
Davis and the Legislature to put California's students first.</TE>

<HD>Academic Decathlon Wins Leave Schools Thinking Big</HD>
<DH>Education: Reseda, Venice teams hope first trip to state
finals will give their programs more campus prestige.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifteen-year-old Reseda High School sophomore Deep Bhatt, a Tupac
Shakur fan, got so wrapped up studying for the Academic Decathlon
that he would dance to Patsy Cline in his living room.</LD>
<LD>   Country music--the genre being used in competition this
year--unexpectedly broadened the young hip-hop fan's listening tastes
to include such singers as Johnny Cash.</LD>
<LD>   But anything's possible now in the eyes of Bhatt, his Reseda
teammates and their cross-town rivals, Venice High School. The two
schools are among nine Los Angeles Unified teams that will compete
this month in the annual California Academic Decathlon in Modesto.</LD>
<TE>   So what's the fuss? It's the first time Reseda and Venice have
made the cut since the so-called "acadeca" was introduced to the
district 21 years ago. Now their respective campuses are abuzz with
pride and visions of building the same academic prestige the
competition's perennial favorites enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was surreal," Venice senior Victor Long said. "Last year we
dropped out of the top 10 [in the district competition]. We were
disillusioned. The accomplishment this year, we never saw it coming."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Reseda scored the lowest of the nine L.A. Unified
representatives, its scores still rank as the 21st highest of the 50
teams that will compete in Modesto March 22-24.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California teams, L.A. County and LAUSD in particular,
have made a strong commitment [to the Academic Decathlon] and
consequently do pretty well," said Marvin Cobb, executive director of
the California Academic Decathlon Assn. "It's always exciting to have
teams that haven't ever been to state or haven't been there for a
while."</TE>
<TE>   The state winner will move on to the national competition April
10-11 in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The district contingent is anchored by defending national
champions El Camino Real of Woodland Hills, which has taken the L.A.
Unified title seven years in a row. Since 1981, L.A. Unified has won
six national titles: two by Marshall High School (1987 and 1995), two
by Taft High School (1989 and 1994) and two by El Camino, which won
its first in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Reseda and Venice are a far cry from powerhouse El Camino and
contenders Marshall, Palisades Charter, Los Angeles and North
Hollywood. Teams from San Pedro and Garfield will round out the
nine-team LAUSD contingent.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a belief at Reseda and Venice that their recent
success has planted the seeds for stronger support of the decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike El Camino, where dozens of students apply each year just to
try out for its decathlon team, Venice improves at a slower pace. In
a recent recruitment meeting, Venice's coaches tripled last year's
turnout of five students. At Reseda, 40 students showed up for a
recent recruitment meeting, 10 more than last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not finished," Reseda coach Rochelle Kronstadt said. "We
can get better each year."</TE>
<TE>   Kronstadt is only in her second year heading Reseda's team. But in
her first season, she led the school to the "Most Improved Team"
award after it jumped 21 places in the L.A. Unified standings from
the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   She has inspired her students to study up to 40 hours a week,
enlisted teachers to help coach specific subjects and bought
comfortable camping chairs for her team to lounge and study in.</TE>
<TE>   "The credit really goes to the coach," Reseda Principal Bob
Kladifko said. "This is new to us, and we're very proud of our
students. We're on cloud nine."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Bhatt, the Reseda team includes Aaron Estrin, Bryan
Furukawa, Louis Levine, Andrew Lousuebsakul, Leeja Patel, Kyle Scott,
Aneet Toor and Sandra Torossian.</TE>
<TE>   Ruchi Varma was taken off the team only days before the Feb. 2
Super Quiz when the district said her grade point average was too
high to compete as a C student.</TE>
<TE>   A decathlon team is broken into three groups of three students,
each representing a different grade level from A to C. Varma was a B
student when the team already had three B team members.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Varma is treated just like a team member and will
travel to Modesto. She'll also be there March 20 when the school
throws a send-off pep rally for the team--which could be the first
time some students will have ever heard of the Academic Decathlon.
Not that some decathletes' egos haven't been massaged already.</TE>
<TE>   "We get respect now when we walk in the hallways," Bhatt said. "We
used to just be nerds. But now we're nerds that are going to state."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Reseda came out of nowhere last year, Venice has spent the
last decade flirting with success. They finished in the district's
top 10 standings in 10 of the last 11 years and missed out on a state
berth by one position three times in that period, Venice coach
Richard Erdman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to pull a guilt trip on my team," he said. "I wanted to
go to state at least once before I retire."</TE>
<TE>   Erdman, who has been at Venice for 32 years, exemplifies the
attitude of the campus, his students say. Located only a few minutes'
drive from Venice Beach, it is one of the few schools in the district
not surrounded by fencing. The campus' more laid-back atmosphere
shows in the team's attitude toward Academic Decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   While some schools go on retreats to study and cram for endless
hours into the night, Erdman wants his students to give a healthy
effort but also pursue things other than decathlon. A tough week for
them means 15 to 20 hours of studying.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's cool that the kids don't sit here studying until 11
at night," he said. "I think the kids need to experience other things
to move on to college. The idea that you have to limit yourself by
making decathlon everything really bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   So team members like Sarah Dickinson, Lauren Yamagata, Kira Siam
and Kelly Seales still find time to go to movies, hang out at one
another's homes and join the swimming and soccer teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between our school and others is that we still
have our lives," Seales joked.</TE>
<TE>   Venice finished sixth in the district standings and 17th out of
the field of 50 going to Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice team also includes Zachary Mann, Alexander Ruiz, Brian
Westphal and one of the district's top-scorers, Alexander Gord.</TE>
<TE>   The team hopes to finish in the top 10 at the state finals. But
members are taking it in stride. They already have a sense of
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've learned more than I ever would have just by
going to class," Westphal said.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Many sheriff's departments in the state are
assigning special units to combat agricultural thefts and other
offenses.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Paula rancher Bob Pinkerton has been ripped off by avocado
rustlers more times than he can remember. But he still can be
surprised at how brazen crop bandits can be.</LD>
<LD>   Just last week, in the middle of the workday, two men backed a
silver sedan into one of his orchards. While one served as the
lookout, the other piled hundreds of the pear-shaped fruit into the
car.</LD>
<LD>   The thieves probably would have kept at it had it not been for
quick-acting neighbors who alerted Pinkerton and triggered a call to
Ventura County's agricultural crime busters.</LD>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department unit is one of a growing number in the
state dedicated solely to combating agricultural crime. The two-man
team scours the farmland in pursuit of those who prey on ranchers and
bleed hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from the county's
$1-billion-a-year agricultural industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the bad guys to know that they just can't come in and
steal from us," said Pinkerton, who toured the crime scene with
Deputy Jason Hendren.</TE>
<TE>   The bandits had fled as soon as they were spotted, and only a pair
of muddy tire tracks and a sea of broken stems remained as evidence
of the noontime heist. At current prices, the haul probably cost
Pinkerton at least $100--the threshold at which the thieves could go
to prison under especially stringent state laws protecting farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies Launch Assault on Thieves</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to catch them every time, but they are going to
know this is a hard place to get into," Pinkerton said. "The attitude
in Ventura County has become, if you are going to come here and
commit agricultural crime, you better be prepared to do the time."</TE>
<TE>   That tough-nosed approach is taking root in agricultural counties
across California, as law enforcement agencies lead an all-out
assault on a rural scourge battering farmers and ranchers at a time
when many are struggling to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   From San Joaquin to San Diego, crime rings routinely wipe out
whole sections of orchards, often employing vehicles outfitted with
heavy-duty shocks to support the weight of their illegal booty.
Thieves also steal farm chemicals, aluminum irrigation pipe and even
wind machines for resale on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   In Imperial County, bandits swipe tractors and other farm
equipment, driving them across the border and out of the reach of
U.S. authorities. In the Central Valley, methamphetamine rings have
targeted remote farming areas as a favorite place to set up
clandestine labs.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers fence their property, but bandits cut their way through.
Farm groups offer rewards, but not enough people are calling to
collect.</TE>
<TE>   While it's hard to calculate statewide losses, farm officials say
they extend into the tens of millions of dollars each year. Some of
the theft is by drug users or transients looking to turn a quick
buck, officials say, while some smacks of organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We have [thieves] come up from other places who, with two or
three vanloads of people, can clean out an entire orchard in one
night," said Fresno County Sheriff's Sgt. Frances Devins, president
of California Rural Crime Prevention Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a farmer's entire profit for one year," she said. "Gone in
one night."</TE>
<TE>   More Money, Personnel Assigned to Farm Crime</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno and other agricultural counties, however, farmers and
law enforcement leaders are fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of California's 58 counties now have law enforcement
personnel dedicated to solving and preventing agricultural crimes,
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies in the San Joaquin Valley formed an
eight-county task force in 1999 to battle rural crime. As part of
that effort, Fresno County is receiving about $800,000 in state money
this year to assign five detectives, a sergeant and two prosecutors
full time to combating crop theft and other farm-related wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide crime prevention task force twice a year offers a
school to train law enforcement officers on rural crime prevention,
while the California Farm Bureau runs a Farm Watch program, which
employs a Neighborhood Watch approach to preventing fruit and cattle
theft. The Farm Bureau, the California Avocado Commission and other
groups also offer rewards of up to $1,000 to tipsters who turn in
agricultural rustlers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the state's 10th-largest agricultural producer,
rural crime fighters have been on the job since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the agricultural community lobbied hard for beefed-up
enforcement, concerned that thieves were stealing with abandon. In
some years, bandits were able to pull nearly $1 million in fruit and
farm products from the county's fields and orchards as fighting
agricultural theft took a back seat to more high-profile crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department's agricultural crimes unit has been
instrumental in curbing the rural assault, evolving over the years
from a crime prevention program to an aggressive investigative team
that handles every farm-related crime in the department's
jurisdiction--from illegal dumping and crop theft to pilfered farm
equipment and cockfighting.</TE>
<TE>   There were 111 such incidents reported last year totaling $305,000
in losses. But Deputy Hendren and partner Don Jennings recovered
nearly half of that amount, leading to 65 arrests and convictions in
all but two cases.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of farmers don't want to report these crimes because they
are either too busy working and don't have time to wait for a deputy
to come out and take a report or they feel like it's a waste of their
time," said Hendren, the son of a Santa Clara Valley citrus and
avocado rancher who joined the agricultural unit a year and a half
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate in this unit in that we can look into each and
every case that comes to us," Hendren said. "We want them to know
that there is somebody out there for them, that it's important to the
department, and that we are going to take it seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies are battling more than the bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Told to Take More Precautions</TE>
<TE>   In an agricultural county where suburbia is pushing ever closer to
farmland, they are trying to cut down on crimes of opportunity by
convincing farmers that they can no longer afford to keep the keys in
their tractors and their barn doors unlocked.</TE>
<TE>   They also are trying to change public attitudes. Some people see
no problem with stopping by the roadside and helping themselves to a
bag of fruit. They don't realize that they are stealing from farmers
who are finding it increasingly difficult to make a profit, as rising
production costs and other pressures chip away at what once was the
county's dominant industry.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of these operations, it's a break-even proposition,"
said Jennings, a senior deputy who transferred from fugitive-warrant
detail to the agricultural crimes unit two years ago. "So even a
small amount of theft can push them from the black into the red."</TE>
<TE>   That is why every crime is taken so seriously. Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Tom Connors handles all of the county's agricultural crimes and
said his office prosecutes every case, even if it involves stealing a
couple of dollars of fruit. Penalties range from fines for
misdemeanor offenses to prison time if the haul is large enough and
other aggravating circumstances apply.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings and Hendren drive home the same message whenever they
meet with growers or talk to farm groups.</TE>
<TE>   The department offers a program in which five-digit identification
numbers are assigned to farmers and ranchers and posted on their
properties. Growers can carve the IDs into farm equipment in case it
is stolen, and deputies can use the numbers to easily identify
properties while on patrol or when responding to a call.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies also provide their pager and cell phone numbers to
farmers and last month set up an e-mail account, ag.crimes@mail.co
.ventura.ca.us, to speed their ability to share information.</TE>
<TE>   Deep in the Santa Clara Valley, the county area hit hardest by
agricultural crime, Santa Paula resident Suzanne Savard caught a trio
of avocado thieves.</TE>
<TE>   She was driving down the road one evening last August when she
spotted a van parked in a Santa Paula orchard. Because she grew up on
an avocado ranch, she thought the vehicle looked out of place.
Suddenly, three men took off running, and Savard dialed 911 and
tailed them until deputies arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, they had stolen 160 pounds of avocados--enough to
charge them with a felony. They were convicted of misdemeanors and
were sentenced to 30 days in jail and ordered to pay $180 in
restitution to the grower.</TE>
<TE>   Hendren and Jennings joined Farm Bureau officials last week in
presenting Savard with a $1,000 reward for her vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep up the good work," Farm Bureau President Edgar Terry said as
he handed over the check. "Maybe this will be a good incentive for
people to keep an eye out."</TE>
<TE>   At Bob Pinkerton's Santa Paula ranch, he's got his own set of
incentives.</TE>
<TE>   When bandits raid one of his orchards, he loses more than just the
cost of the fruit. He spends thousands of dollars an acre on watering
and fertilizing his crop and protecting it from frost. He pays his
taxes on the property and waits a year to arrive at the moment when
the fruit is ready to be picked.</TE>
<TE>   So that last thing he wants is to walk into one of his groves and
see nothing but stems where avocados should be.</TE>
<TE>   "You just know you've got to be constantly on the watch for it,"
he said. "It's all part of the job when you're in agriculture. If
somebody comes in and thinks they've found a gold mine, they'll keep
coming back to it. We want to get across the idea in this county that
this is not a very good place to come and steal."</TE>

<DH>Agriculture: Sheriff's departments in Ventura County and
elsewhere in state are assigning special units to combat crop thefts
and other offenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Paula rancher Bob Pinkerton has been ripped off by avocado
rustlers more times than he can remember. But he still can be
surprised at how brazen crop bandits can be.</LD>
<LD>   Just last week, in the middle of the workday, two men backed a
silver sedan into one of his orchards. While one served as the
lookout, the other piled hundreds of the pear-shaped fruit into the
car.</LD>
<LD>   The thieves probably would have kept at it had it not been for
quick-acting neighbors who alerted Pinkerton and triggered a call to
Ventura County's agricultural crime busters.</LD>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department unit is one of a growing number in the
state dedicated solely to combating agricultural crime. The two-man
team scours the farmland in pursuit of those who prey on ranchers and
bleed hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from the county's
$1-billion-a-year agricultural industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the bad guys to know that they just can't come in and
steal from us," said Pinkerton, who toured the crime scene with
Deputy Jason Hendren.</TE>
<TE>   The bandits had fled as soon as they were spotted, and only a pair
of muddy tire tracks and a sea of broken stems remained as evidence
of the noontime heist. At current prices, the haul probably cost
Pinkerton at least $100--the threshold at which the thieves could go
to prison under especially stringent state laws protecting farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to catch them every time, but they are going to
know this is a hard place to get into," Pinkerton said. "The attitude
in Ventura County has become, if you are going to come here and
commit agricultural crime, you better be prepared to do the time."</TE>
<TE>   That tough-nosed approach is taking root in agricultural counties

<HD>Arsonists Hit University Housing Project</HD>
<DH>Crime: Investigators in Buena Park find incendiary devices
in the rubble after three homes under construction are destroyed and
a fourth one is damaged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arsonists caused $200,000 in damage Sunday when a predawn fire
destroyed three houses under construction as part of an
affordable-housing program for Cal State Fullerton faculty and staff,
fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses saw several people running from the scene when the fire
was set about 4 a.m. at the University Gables project at Dale Street
and Malvern Avenue in Buena Park, said Orange County Fire Authority
Capt. Stephen Miller. ''This is definitely arson,'' he said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire destroyed three houses being framed and damaged a fourth,
said Miller.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators found evidence of incendiary devices in the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   There were no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses saw people run from the area and speed away in two
vehicles, Miller said. Descriptions of those who fled and their
vehicles were not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   University Gables was part of a plan by Cal State Fullerton
officials to provide affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   They were in search of land while Buena Park had land that was
blighted but owned by the county's Flood Control District.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a three-way swap, the district sold the land to the
city and the university.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for 56 single-family homes and 30 townhomes for
new faculty and staff.</TE>
<TE>   Prices are expected to top out at $235,000, roughly 40% to 50%
less than comparable homes in the area.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Art Brown said the project won city approval a
year ago because the vacant eight acres along Brea Creek on Buena
Park's north side was filled with weeds in what amounted to an old
flood control catch basin that had become a ''dust bowl.''</TE>
<TE>   Dirt had been trucked in, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Then flood control personnel began using the catch basin to train
on backhoes and tractors.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's terrible that somebody would burn homes so badly in need by
faculty and staff of a university,'' Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Taking Hits on Energy, Davis Jabs at FERC</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis won't know for certain until Tuesday night which
Republican will be pounding on him this fall. But he already knows
his soft spot. And that's energy.</LD>
<LD>   Those $43-billion long-term power contracts, in particular, are
political losers. Never mind that they helped get California through
last summer with air conditioning, while stabilizing the market and
forcing down the spot price of electricity.</LD>
<TE>   Most voters aren't buying it. They agree with Davis' critics: He
purchased too much juice for too many years at too high a cost.</TE>
<TE>   So the governor last week moved to shift future responsibility for
the contracts to the Bush administration, specifically the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Davis gave the green light for the Public Utilities Commission to
file a complaint with FERC alleging that the state was overcharged by
$21 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The sellers had California over a barrel," contended PUC
President Loretta Lynch, adding that in an atmosphere of blackout
threats, they put "a gun to our head."</TE>
<TE>   Davis praised the contracts when he unveiled them last June. Their
average cost was about 7 cents a kilowatt. The state had been paying
around 30 cents, buying electricity for bankrupt utilities. But
recently, the spot-market cost has dipped into the 3-cent range.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts were vital, Davis now says, but "we still paid more
than we should have." He wants the feds either to set a lower price
or order renegotiation.</TE>
<TE>   It's reminiscent of former Gov. Jerry Brown in 1978, when Davis
was his chief of staff. Brown had spoken out loudly against
Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting initiative.</TE>
<TE>   When it passed overwhelmingly, the governor eagerly embraced and
helped implement the measure. Flip-flop, critics cried. Not really.
But Brown did adapt to the voters' mood, and that's what Davis is
doing.</TE>
<TE>   This governor has picked up the voters' vibes: The state got took.
He has given up trying to explain how the contracts helped keep the
lights on and tame the market. People aren't listening. They believe
the yearlong criticism of him by Republicans and power companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're never going to win this issue," a Davis advisor concedes.</TE>
<TE>   But Californians also blame the federal government for not
protecting them from the gougers, including the president's fellow
Texans, now symbolized by evil Enron. It took dogged pressure from
Davis--like a yapping terrier--and a new Democratic majority in the
U.S. Senate to goad FERC into finally setting crucial price caps.</TE>
<TE>   Voters distrust both the federal government and the power
producers. So Davis has decided to pile on. He's putting the monkey
on FERC. If it refuses to help, the governor can argue he's done all
he can.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want people off our back," a Davis aide says.</TE>
<TE>   Not just Republicans, but people like PUC President Lynch.
Internal politics also is at play.</TE>
<TE>   Score one for Lynch. Although a Davis appointee, she was a harsh
critic of the contracts and demanded renegotiation. Her leverage was
PUC control over an electricity rate structure necessary to finance
$11.1 billion in bonds the state needed to reimburse its power
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't have gone down the renegotiation road without Loretta
holding out," a state official says.</TE>
<TE>   A deal was struck. It included Davis' agreement, several weeks
ago, to renegotiate the contracts. But talks have lagged. By
permitting Lynch to take her case to FERC, the governor has
punctuated his commitment to renegotiation.</TE>
<TE>   It also pressures the power companies to settle, Davis hopes.
Settle or suffer a drawn-out suit.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' vulnerability was seen in a Times poll last week. By 2 to
1, voters disapprove of how the governor has handled energy. Their
overall impression of him is slightly favorable, but among those who
view him unfavorably, the biggest reason by far is his "poor"
performance on energy.</TE>
<TE>   His perceived failure on energy contributes to an image, for many,
of weak leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis and the voters are in sync on one thing: Deregulation
should be dumped. A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California
found voters declaring, by 3 to 1, that the state should "reregulate
power to control prices."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate, no doubt, will argue for less regulation and
more free market.</TE>
<TE>   Davis recently told a Democratic state convention: "California
will return to the disastrous deregulation scheme over this
governor's dead body."</TE>
<TE>   The political grave can be avoided, Davis believes, if voters
don't dwell on the past, but focus on their energy future. Will it be
public control or market control? Unregulated markets can be
manipulated by profiteers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will pound back with that winning argument.</TE>

<HD>Asian Americans Show Large Population Growth</HD>
<DH>Census: Nationwide the group has increased 72% in a decade
and now numbers 11.9 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Asian American population grew at about five times the
national rate from 1990 to 2000, with California remaining home to
more Asian Americans than any state, according to a census report
released today.</LD>
<LD>   Asian Americans now comprise 4.2% of the U.S. population,
according to the 2000 census, up from 2.8% in 1990. The Asian
American population grew 72%, to 11.9 million, while the total
population grew 13%, to 281 million.</LD>
<LD>   New York and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest cities, had the
most Asian Americans. The highest proportions of Asian Americans in
places with populations more than 100,000, however, were in Honolulu
and nine California cities.</LD>
<TE>   Honolulu's Asian American population stood at 68% of the total.
Daly City, with a 54% Asian American population, was second, followed
by Fremont (40%) and Sunnyvale (34%); all three cities are in the Bay
Area and ranked ahead of San Francisco (32.6%). Irvine, in sixth
place, had the highest proportion of Asian Americans among Southern
California cities, with 32.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove (32.2%) and Torrance (31%) were the other Southern
California cities among the 10 communities with the highest
percentage of Asian Americans. Also on the list were Santa Clara
(31.4%) and San Jose (28.8%).</TE>
<TE>   The 1990 and 2000 national Asian American population figures are
not strictly comparable, the Census Bureau cautioned. In the 2000
census, respondents could identify themselves by more than one race,
whereas in 1990 only one race could be chosen.</TE>
<TE>   While growing dramatically, many characteristics of the Asian
American population were consistent with trends identified in 1990.
Asian Americans continued to be concentrated in the West and in
cities and suburbs, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   As in 1990, Chinese was the largest Asian American ethnic group
identified in the census, followed by Filipino.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Indian was the third-ranking ethnicity. Japanese, which had
been the third-largest Asian ethnicity in 1990, was sixth in 2000.
Korean rose from fifth in 1990 to fourth in 2000, and Vietnamese was
the fifth-largest ethnicity in 2000, rising from sixth in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA demographer Paul Ong said the slower growth rate for Japanese
Americans is due to low birth and immigration rates, combined with
high out-marriage rates.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the Asian American population in 2000 lived in just
three states. California had by far the largest Asian population (4.2
million), followed by New York (1.2 million) and Hawaii (700,000).</TE>
<TE>   Three-fourths of Asian Americans live in 10 states: California,
New York, Hawaii, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Florida,
Virginia and Massachusetts. Those states also had the largest Asian
populations in 1990.</TE>

<HD>Flames of Hate End Life of Gay Man, Show Biz Dream</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect in the 'horrendous' Santa Barbara killing
could face the death penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>A stack of glossy promotional photos showing a smiling Clint Scott
Risetter sits atop a large pile of ashes inside his fire-gutted
apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Originally from rural South Dakota, Risetter had moved west more
than a decade ago with hopes of making it big in films. He never
realized his dream.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old man was killed last week, the victim of an
arsonist who poured gasoline over him and set him on fire, partly
because Risetter was gay, the suspect later told police.</LD>
<TE>   Police say Martin Thomas Hartman is a mentally troubled
38-year-old Santa Barbara resident who had been a suspect in numerous
arson fires in the city. But they never had enough evidence to charge
him.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman told police that he met Risetter about six months ago and
learned recently that Risetter was homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   "[Hartman] first said he did it because the victim was unhappy and
depressed so he didn't need to be around in the world," said police
Sgt. Mike McGrew, the lead investigator on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "He also said he killed him because he was gay, and he has a lot
of hatred toward gay people."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman has been charged with murder, arson and a hate crime in
connection with Risetter's death Feb. 24. If convicted, he could face
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a horrendous crime. It's so shocking when something
this gruesome occurs for such an evil, hateful reason," said Terry
Leftgoff, president of the Gay and Lesbian Business Assn. in Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Tom Roberts, who is gay, also condemned the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I think any human being who is set on fire is about as heinous an
act as possible. But this was done as a hate crime, which makes it
much more profoundly sad," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday at Trinity Episcopal Church, which has a large and
active gay and lesbian membership, Rector Mark Asman asked his
congregation not to "let what happened drag us into a place of
revenge or hatred, but instead find a way to turn it into good."</TE>
<TE>   He asked the congregation to "keep the families of Martin Hartman
and Clint Risetter in our prayers."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview from her home in South Dakota, Risetter's
mother, Blanche Risetter, choked back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this has happened. His father just died, and now
Clint," she said. "If this man is guilty of this crime, there needs
to be justice."</TE>
<TE>   She said she does not believe her son was gay.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, when he calmly walked into the police station and
confessed, Hartman lived with his mother in a well-maintained
two-story house in one of the city's older neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   He has a history of mental illness and had been a suspect in at
least 10 arsons over the past decade, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Hartman was the prime suspect in an arson at his mother's
property, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The bed of a tenant named Jimmy Walker, who was living in a rental
house, was torched. Walker was not injured, and detectives were
unable to find enough physical evidence to make an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been chasing him around for 10 years," McGrew said. "I
think this time around, though, the fact that he killed somebody put
him over the edge. It was something more than he could handle."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on the front porch of her Garden Street home Sunday, the
suspect's mother, Waltraudt Hartman, acknowledged that her son had
been upset lately but insisted he did not kill Risetter.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always a good son, and he never hurt me," she said. "He
didn't drink or smoke or take drugs. He was depressed lately, but he
was not on medication.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe anything that I have read or heard."</TE>
<TE>   He Moved West, Hoping to Be Actor, Model</TE>
<TE>   The son of a farmer and stay-at-home mom, Clint Risetter grew up
in Wolsey, S.D., a prairie town of about 600 east of the Black Hills.</TE>
<TE>   His mother said he played trumpet in his high school band and got
his first taste of travel when the group performed throughout Europe,
including a concert at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from the University of South Dakota in 1986,
Risetter worked around Wolsey for a couple of years before moving to
California with the hope of making it as an actor or model.</TE>
<TE>   But things didn't go as planned. He lived with a cousin in
Palmdale for a short time before moving to Ventura, where he managed
a Pizza Hut for five years, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, Risetter modeled part time, mostly men's
clothing, and landed bit parts in various movies, including the 1991
Michael J. Fox comedy "Doc Hollywood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, Risetter performs a dance scene with several other
actors.</TE>
<TE>   "He liked movies and show business and really wanted to be part of
that," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, Risetter had moved to his apartment on
Micheltorena Street in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   He continued to model and act part time but started selling real
estate to pay the bills, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   By March 2000, he dropped out of the business after his boss died
and the office closed.</TE>
<TE>   Risetter never gave up his dream of working as an entertainer. He
occasionally rented a room at a house in Hollywood, where he would go
for auditions.</TE>
<TE>   Although he never brought around his dates, several of his Santa
Barbara neighbors said Risetter never tried to hide his sexual
orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Mackenzie, a friend who lived in an adjacent apartment
complex, described Risetter as a "soft-spoken, benevolent guy ... the
type of person who would go out of his way to say hello to you."</TE>
<TE>   She said she had known Risetter for two years and that the two
would often sit on the front lawn and talk about movies and
Risetter's desire to be an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "I always got the sense, though, that he was troubled," Mackenzie
said.</TE>
<TE>   The death of his father and also that of a close friend two years
ago apparently caused Risetter to drink excessively, others said.</TE>
<TE>   Several neighbors said homeless people often hung out at
Risetter's apartment, sometimes drinking with him or sleeping on his
couch.</TE>
<TE>   They said Risetter kept cases of canned vegetables and other
nonperishables to hand out to transients.</TE>
<TE>   Officers were called to Risetter's apartment on several occasions
for noise and drinking disturbances, said Sgt. Jim Pfleging.</TE>
<TE>   One time, officers arrived and found Risetter passed out on his
porch, he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Shaver, a neighbor and friend, said Risetter had struggled
with alcohol for years.</TE>
<TE>   He said Risetter, who had been out of work in recent months and
was receiving Social Security for a disability, had joined a 12-step
program and sobered up, but then lapsed a few weeks ago and began
drinking again.</TE>
<TE>   "He disappeared and wasn't coming home for about a month," Shaver
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw him hanging out downtown a few times with some really tough
people."</TE>
<TE>   Police Didn't Consider 'Marty' a High Risk</TE>
<TE>   Hartman has lived for years with his mother at their home on
Garden Street, a few blocks from the victim's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   He had been arrested in the past for indecent exposure and public
intoxication, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, known by officers on the street as Marty, spent much of
his time shuffling up and down the narrow streets and alleys near
downtown. He wasn't homeless but knew people who were, said Sgt. Ed
Olsen.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Hartman would vanish from the streets for months, Olsen
said.</TE>
<TE>   But then he would return, offering up theories to police about how
a certain building must have been burned or how a particular crime
was committed.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd come into the lobby [of the police station] a lot, saying he
had information," Olsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen said Hartman wasn't considered by police to be a high risk
but wasn't thought of as harmless, either.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, a mutual friend introduced Risetter to
Hartman's mother a few months ago, and that is how the two men became
acquainted.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the friend told Hartman's mother that Risetter was gay.
She then told her son, McGrew said.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of Feb. 24, Hartman walked to Risetter's
apartment with a can of gasoline, doused the victim while he slept on
a mattress and set him on fire, police said. Risetter awoke engulfed
in flames and ran onto his patio, where he was found dead by
firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hartman's mother read a newspaper article about the
fire. Although the victim had not been identified, she told her son
she thought it was probably Risetter, police said.</TE>
<TE>   He immediately "came to the police station," McGrew said. "He
talked about everything that had happened that day and walked us
through it step by step."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman told detectives that he had become upset when his mother
told him Risetter was gay, police said. Hartman said his anger toward
gay men stemmed in part from being hit on once by a man.</TE>
<TE>   To help confirm Hartman's account, police brought in a bloodhound
to assist in gathering evidence. Using the scent from one of
Hartman's shoes, the dog led officers into the apartment exactly as
Hartman had claimed he had entered it. The dog then went directly to
the victim's bed and out onto the patio, McGrew said.</TE>
<TE>   'United We Stand. Never Be Forgotten.'</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles
remained under an oak tree at the end of a driveway leading to
Risetter's apartment. Tacked to the tree was a note that read:
"United We Stand. Never be forgotten. Always to be loved. A symbol of
silence that needs to be broken."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, the former city councilman, said he hopes people will see
Risetter's death as a wake-up call to shed misconceived fears about
gays and lesbians and to end the violence against them, citing the
case of Matthew Shepherd, a gay college student from Wyoming who was
beaten to death in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not immune to this here," said Roberts, who said he was
beaten several years ago by a group of gay-bashers while vacationing
out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   "There will always be people who say [Risetter] got what was
coming to him--just like they did when Matthew Shepherd was
killed--so we've got a lot of work to do as a society to understand
and deal with these issues," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Since her husband died in October at age 88, Blanche Risetter said
her only moments of happiness had been the regular phone calls from
her son. She recalled speaking with him on several occasions over the
last month. He called on Valentine's Day and two days later on Feb.
16, her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had called her son on the afternoon he was killed,
but they chatted only briefly because he was tired.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was going to lay down and rest," she said. "That's the
last time I talked to him."</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopefuls Pick Up Pace, Cut Criticism</HD>
<DH>Election: Candidates stump across the Southland as they
make their final pitch to sway undecided voters on the last weekend
before the gubernatorial primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN  and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leading Republican candidates for governor picked up their paces
but toned down their rhetoric Sunday as they raced across Southern
California making last-minute appeals to undecided voters in the GOP
primary on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan kept on the attack
against rival Bill Simon Jr. But Riordan--who on Friday called Simon
a "sanctimonious hypocrite"--generally struck a more conciliatory
tone, saying both Simon and the third contender, Secretary of State
Bill Jones, would be "infinitely better" than the Democratic
incumbent, Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever the nominee is, I will fight as hard as I can to get them
elected in November," said Riordan, whose poll ratings have fallen as
Simon's have risen.</LD>
<TE>   Jones, too, stayed on the offensive as he stumped in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   He accused Riordan of changing his position on the controversial
El Toro airport proposal, and he charged that Simon was trying to
"buy" the GOP nomination.</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, it was a mild scolding compared to his typically acid
critiques of his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who with his family has pumped $5.5 million into his
campaign, tried to stay above it all.</TE>
<TE>   In Burbank, he appeared before a jubilant crowd of about 40
supporters who waved campaign signs and shouted, "Go, Bill, go!" He
spoke for less than two minutes and spent most of his time waving,
shaking hands and hugging children.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblymen Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), an early Simon
supporter, introduced him as "the one gubernatorial candidate who
will not just not raise your taxes, but will lower your taxes."
(Riordan also has proposed a tax cut.)</TE>
<TE>   Simon stuck to his three staple issues--the budget, schools and
the state's infrastructure. He offered no new details Sunday on what
he wants to do in those areas, but said they are the topics that
define his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're going to do--if we're fortunate enough to win the
primary on Tuesday--we're going to take it to Gray Davis on those
three issues," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   With that, Simon descended into the small crowd, which buried him
in hugs and handshakes. A white-haired woman whispered to him, "The
Bible says that when the righteous rule, the people are at peace."
Others cried: "Gov. Simon!"</TE>
<TE>   Simon also dismissed Riordan's assertion Friday that he was an
"extremist"--a reference, in part, to Simon's opposition to abortion
rights, a stand at odds with the views of most state voters. Simon
said he was in line with most Californians on the issues he cares
most about.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard anyone challenge the fact that we need to reduce
our traffic," Simon told reporters. "I've never heard anyone
challenge the need for cheaper water and power."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Riordan kept a frenetic pace of campaigning Sunday,
dashing from downtown Los Angeles to Riverside County, then back to
Pasadena and Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan awoke before dawn to bike the Los Angeles Marathon route.
At the end of the 26-mile ride, Riordan--sporting a blue parka and
black nylon warmup pants--mounted an outdoor stage among hundreds of
cyclists on a lawn at USC. He lamented the more than $10 million
worth of Davis television ads that cast him as an untrustworthy
flip-flopper.</TE>
<TE>   "On Tuesday, we're going to show them!" Riordan shouted. "We're
not going to let Gray Davis hijack the Republican primary."</TE>
<TE>   The ads appear to have played a large role in undermining what was
once Riordan's solid lead in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to rebound, Riordan over the last week has been
striking more conservative themes to draw support from the sort of
GOP primary voters who often shun moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he has played up his support for the death
penalty and played down his support for gun control, saying he backs
the "right to bear arms."</TE>
<TE>   But aides acknowledged Sunday that Riordan's campaign was
broadcasting a radio ad that attacks Simon for getting an "A" rating
from the National Rifle Assn. The ad is targeted to stations with
high numbers of women listeners--potential moderate voters in the
Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   From USC, Riordan went to the starting line of the runners'
marathon in front of the Disney Hall construction site, where he
posed for photographs with his successor, Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   From there, he went to Riverside County, where he made calls from
a campaign phone bank in the Corona office of his chief fund-raiser,
pharmaceutical magnate Mark Chapin Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was subdued. Half of the two dozen telemarketing cubicles
were empty. Several of the callers occupying other cubicles were
employees of Chapin's medical products company or members of their
families. One of the callers acknowledged he did not support Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Riordan supporters said they were upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good," Johnson said. "We're coming along well. I think
we're making progress. I'm still very optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Barbara Hiller Johnson, was bitter about the rising
popularity of Simon among conservatives, saying a victory by the
novice candidate would doom the party to defeat in November.</TE>
<TE>   "They're willing to commit suicide," she said of the GOP's right
wing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his phone banks--which Riordan himself joined
briefly Sunday--Riordan has taped messages that will be left on
thousands of answering machines at the homes of GOP voters before
polls close Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has taped a get-out-the-vote message
for Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Another message taped by the candidate's wife, Nancy Daly Riordan,
a Democrat, is being targeted to 500,000 coastal Republican women,
said Craig Wilson, a Riordan campaign consultant.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, where Riordan greeted passersby at shops along
Colorado Boulevard, Riordan told reporters that Davis was failing to
address California's troubles in transportation, housing and health
care.</TE>
<TE>   "Our state's going off a cliff," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also voiced regret that he did not respond sooner to the
Davis ads. "If I'd come out earlier, it would have been easier,"
Riordan said. "But that's hindsight."</TE>

<DH>Lifeguards: After a campaign to drum up applicants, Laguna
Beach puts 55 candidates through tough tests to find (and hire) the
best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With gusto and grit, 55 fit young men and women charged into the
bright blue waters off Laguna Beach on a clear Sunday morning to see
whether they have what it takes to become a city lifeguard.</LD>
<LD>   The showing was one of the largest in recent memory and the field
one of the strongest, giving Chief Lifeguard Mark Klosterman hope
that he will be able to fill his ranks without a struggle for the
first time in years.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a lot of potential here," Klosterman said after the
grueling tryouts were over. "This is a great start-up. If this works
out right, we'll have all our staffing needs met--no doubt."</LD>
<TE>   Lifeguard tests have long been an annual spring rite, and in many
cases an annual rite of passage, in beach communities everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But Laguna Beach and other Southern California cities have been
scrambling to attract enough applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Klosterman, who has been on Laguna's staff for 26 years, said the
regional demand mirrors a national trend, and is largely driven by
two factors.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said, there is more affluence along the coast, and
wealthy kids don't have to work.</TE>
<TE>   Second, more high school and college sports programs are adopting
year-round training programs, draining the pool of athletes who might
otherwise serve as lifeguards.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, you could put one flier up and have people
knocking down your door," Klosterman said. "In the past few years, it
hasn't been so."</TE>
<TE>   With a string of sandy beaches and isolated coves along its jagged
7.5-mile shoreline, the city needs 90 to 100 lifeguards in the
summer. Sixty work full time for the season and the rest are
reserves, earning $13 to $18 an hour, one of the highest pay scales
around.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Marine Safety Department launched an aggressive
recruitment campaign this year.</TE>
<TE>   Staff members traveled pool-to-pool, visiting high schools and
colleges around Orange County to publicize the opportunities and
encourage students to try out.</TE>
<TE>   This year's aspiring lifeguards couldn't have asked for better
conditions as they lined up in front of the lifeguard tower at Main
Beach on Sunday. The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, the tide was
low, and the ocean was almost 60 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The test, which Klosterman says has not really changed in 30
years, has three legs. First comes a 1,000-meter swim, which must be
completed in under 20 minutes. Next is the run-swim-run test, with
each leg 200 meters. Last is a 200-meter swim.</TE>
<TE>   With dolphins diving in the distance, seabirds wheeling overhead
and friends and families cheering from the boardwalk, the candidates
plunged into the surf about 9 a.m. . Everyone finished within 20
minutes, panting hard and shivering in the breeze as they emerged
from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Hedley, 16, was the first woman out of the water, finishing
11th overall. She plays water polo and swims for El Toro High School
in Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun. I love the water. I really liked the swimming part,"
she said, still breathing heavily moments after finishing the final
leg .</TE>
<TE>   Hedley hopes to be among the 40 applicants picked to go through
training in April.</TE>
<TE>   Those selected will spend every weekend that month going through
more physical fitness drills, and learning first aid and advanced
lifesaving techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty well-respected job. It definitely takes a big
commitment for whoever goes through with it," said Andrew Engstrom,
another lifeguard candidate. "I'm kind of out of shape, so I'm
hurting, personally."</TE>
<TE>   Engstrom, a freshman at Northern Arizona University, grew up in
Laguna and played high school water polo. He tried out last year too,
but couldn't complete the training because he had to go to summer
school.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia Rohde, a 16-year-old junior at Dana Hills High School who
won the Teen California beauty pageant in August, said she has wanted
to be a lifeguard ever since she started watching "Baywatch," and
developed a crush on David Hasselhoff.</TE>
<TE>   But as a competitive swimmer, water polo player and sailor, she
knows the job is not as glamorous as television makes it out to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it'd be really cool when people ask you what you do and
you can say, 'I'm a lifeguard,'" she said. "But I think it will be
challenging. It's a big responsibility. It's not sitting and getting
a tan. It's intense. It's not as easy as it seems."</TE>

<HD>Producers Honor 'Moulin Rouge'</HD>
<DH>Awards: The guild's top picks in TV are 'West Wing,' 'Sex
and the City' and 'Band of Brothers.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that boosts the film's Oscars chances, the producers of
the lavish musical drama "Moulin Rouge" waltzed off with top honors
Sunday night in Los Angeles at the 13th annual Producers Guild of
America Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The guild gave its Darryl F. Zanuck producer of the year award in
theatrical motion pictures to Australian director and producer Baz
Luhrmann, and producers Martin Brown and Fred Baron.</LD>
<LD>   The film, which sought to reinvent the Hollywood movie musical,
has received eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture
and best actress for Nicole Kidman, although Luhrmann failed to
receive a best director nomination.</LD>
<TE>   Nine of the last 12 winners of the producers guild awards,
including last year's "Gladiator," have gone on to win best picture
at the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   In television, the guild gave its producer of the year award for
episodic television drama to "The West Wing," while the producers of
"Sex and the City" won in the episodic television comedy category.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and Tony To received the producer of
the year award in long-form television for HBO's "Band of Brothers."</TE>
<TE>   The 1,600-member guild, which held its award show Sunday at the
Century Plaza Hotel, includes 950 full-fledged producers, as well as
associate producers, post-production supervisors, production managers
and post-production coordinators.</TE>

<LD>The idea was simple. Take a walk in the sprawling metropolis with a
world-renowned scientist whose latest book, "The Future of Life," is
an indictment of overpopulation, mindless consumption and
environmental ignorance.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, take a walk through Ground Zero.</LD>
<LD>   As Edward O. Wilson and I headed north on Spring Street in
downtown Los Angeles, he adjusted his hearing aid to tune me in over
the roar of traffic. The Harvard professor, in town for a
conservation conference, is Alabama-born and every inch a Southern
gentleman, down to a proper coat and tie. I felt like I was
stretching my legs with Atticus Finch.</LD>
<TE>   At 1st Street, I made an honest effort to defend our teeming,
overdeveloped burg. I told Wilson that although I live just 10
minutes northwest of downtown, I've got hummingbirds in my frontyard
and coyotes out back.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think Mr. Wilson was bowled over. He said the point is not
what life is still here, hanging on despite our best efforts to drive
it into extinction, but how much of the natural state has already
been destroyed by humankind.</TE>
<TE>   We made safe passage across 1st Street, through the exhaust fumes
and past a roar that had Wilson kicking up the hearing aid again. And
now we found ourselves at a remarkably uninspired and unusable patch
of municipal garden work with an iron fence around it.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like an over-cultivated backyard," Wilson said, arguing
that he'd rather see native plants in their natural state. "A wild
environment would be so much more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   We turned west on 1st and angled north on Broadway, and halfway up
the hill, Wilson suddenly disappeared. I turned to find him down on
the pavement, and feared at first that he'd taken a fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's have a look here," he said on hands and knees, poking
around in a scrubby patch of ivy. "There they are," he went on,
speaking with a child's enthusiasm. "Those are Argentinian ants."</TE>
<TE>   I joined Wilson on the pavement, and passersby eyeballed us as if
we'd had trouble making it back to the office after a three-martini
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who won his second Pulitzer Prize for his 1990 book "The
Ants," pointed out how one ant had peeled off from what he called a
trunk trail.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a forager. He goes out hunting for food and then runs back
to the trail, laying down an odor the other ants can follow back to
the food."</TE>
<TE>   This sounded encouraging to me. In the middle of all this
sun-blasted pavement and congestion, the animal kingdom was alive and
well. Ants by the thousands moved bumper to bumper along the edge of
the ivy. It looked like rush hour on the 405.</TE>
<TE>   So this is a healthy sign? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it isn't," Wilson answered sternly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not?"</TE>
<TE>   "The Argentinian ant is so dominant, they control what insect life
exists by driving other insects out. Soil quality depends on a
variety of organisms, and with just one species it's not as good.
L.A. is absolutely owned by Argentinian ants, and they're not even
from here. They're from Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   Well, we never could control our borders. The Argentinians eat
much larger native ants, and then march through your kitchen and
bathroom, where it's cool and damp. They love L.A., where
overdevelopment has helped them drive out other species.</TE>
<TE>   The horned lizard is barely surviving, displaced by coastal
development and starved by the elimination of their usual prey--the
native ants that are being snacked on by the piggish Argentinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Angelenos have literally driven life forms into a corner," Wilson
said.</TE>
<TE>   What could I say? People love sitting alone in toxic, tank-sized
vehicles as they travel to and from far-flung housing developments.
You'd have to threaten harm to get them into carpool lanes or buses.</TE>
<TE>   "That's amazing," Wilson said. "Most people don't want to have to
worry about how important it is to switch over to another way."</TE>
<TE>   Now he turned his attention back to the marching Argentines.</TE>
<TE>   "We're amazingly like these ants," he said. "They stick to the
trail until they find food, and they have no interest in changing
their ways. They're wrecking their own environment and making the
world less safe for themselves, and ultimately even for us."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson and I sat in that spot for maybe half an hour. The more he
talked, the more awed I was by his respect for life and his sense of
duty.</TE>
<TE>   In a scrubby patch of ivy in downtown L.A., he'd found an appeal
to social responsibility and political conscience. He'd even found an
explanation for war.</TE>
<TE>   Americans devour resources beyond our borders to feed our habits
and our wealth, Wilson said, and this helped fuel the resentment that
played a part in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   We plunder so many acres of the world's resources, Wilson said,
that "to bring the rest of the world up to our level of consumption
would require four more planet Earths."</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be well advised to tie our foreign policy to the development
and protection of flora and fauna the world over. We'd be serving our
own interest in security and markets, and leaving something for
future generations."</TE>
<TE>   On the way back, Wilson called himself semi-optimistic. So, too,
are the last words of his new book:</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we will choose wisely. A civilization able to envision
God and to embark on the colonization of space will surely find the
way to save the integrity of this planet and the magnificent life it
harbors."</TE>

<HD>Panorama City Flourishes Despite Its Rough Reputation</HD>
<DH>Neighborhood: Though the crime rate is high, residents and
leaders see a vibrant community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking at a map of Panorama City, it's easy to see where the
northeast San Fernando Valley neighborhood got its rather dark
nickname, "The Witch's Hat."</LD>
<LD>   But most of the area's residents, police officers and
businesspeople seem to feel it's the good witch, not the wicked one,
that rules this jagged triangle of mostly Latino neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Despite one of the highest crime rates in the Valley, inhabitants
see Panorama City as a vibrant community, full of entrepreneurs,
flourishing retail businesses, determined leaders and colorful street
life.</LD>
<TE>   "Panorama City's rep has been gangbang central, but there is such
a strong sense of community over there," said Jeri Corti, the
community service representative for the local Home Depot. "It's a
very close and warm place."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that more evident than at a park that was once a gang
hangout.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk descends, the Sepulveda Recreation Center seems to be all
that a small urban park should be. Families lounge peacefully on the
grass as a soccer game rages nearby. Basketball courts are full.
There's a wait for the tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Harrelson, a Los Angeles senior lead police officer, cruises
slowly through the park in his patrol car, waving here and there.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a project of mine, keeping this park clean," said
Harrelson, 34. "The people here take a lot of pride in their
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The hub of this 70,000-strong community is Panorama Mall, a
67-store complex anchored by Wal-Mart and La Curacao, an electronics
store. The mall's general manager and its heart and soul is Louise
Marquez, whom Harrelson describes as a "shining light for Panorama
City."</TE>
<TE>   "This is my life; this is me," said Marquez, 50, pointing out the
window where Van Nuys Boulevard traffic zooms by. "There are such
great people in Panorama City. People can say what they want, but if
they come here and look around, they won't say anything bad anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The manager of Wal-Mart, which opened in 1998, said he was aware
of Panorama City's reputation before he took the job.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was not familiar with Panorama City, I did hear it was a
rough neighborhood," said Jorge Lopez, 32. "But that is absolutely
not what I've found. This is one of the friendliest places I know.
And we are exceeding the national average for sales and customer
traffic for stores of our size."</TE>
<TE>   That store is a destination for many of the population of 69,901,
which, according to the 2000 census, is 63.4% Latino, 12.6% Asian,
12.5% white, 4.3% black and 7.2% mixed and other.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 18,479 housing units, 11,270, or 61%, are rentals.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the recent praise, Panorama City still has its
negatives. One of them is stolen cars.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,009 sectors comprising the Los Angeles Police Department,
one in Panorama City--an area bounded by Woodman Avenue, Roscoe
Boulevard and the Pacoima Wash--ranked second in the city for auto
thefts. That reporting district recorded 196 auto thefts, second only
to 256 in an area near Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the crime, Harrelson, who grew up in Panorama City, has
high praise for the neighborhood. "It's really a good community. A
few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in the crowded area north of Roscoe Boulevard patrolled
by the Devonshire Division, home to 43,000 people, there were five
homicides, nine rapes, 186 robberies and 131 aggravated assaults. The
figures are high for the Valley, but not for a rough part of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite problems, Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla,
whose 7th District includes Panorama City, said the area has "a great
spirit and is thriving."</TE>
<TE>   "Panorama City has had its fair share of challenges, but it's come
back strong in the last couple of years," Padilla said, adding that a
new Wells Fargo Bank is a good indication of how business sees the
potential of the area.</TE>
<TE>   When the nonprofit organization Immaculate Heart Community Blythe
Street Project, better known as Casa Esperanza, opened in 1992, the
area was notorious for its gang. Shootings and open drug dealing were
common.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy to say that nowadays that is not a big concern," said
Martiza de Artan, director of Casa Esperanza. The concerns have
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest need right now is for education," De Artan said. "We
have this computer program. We thought just the kids would be
interested. But we were so pleased to see all these moms show up with
their notebooks ready to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Back at Panorama Mall, Marquez is organizing an art show for
schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some hard times, but we've been able to conquer them,"
Marquez said. "The battle is never-ending. But you can't give up.
When people give up, that's when communities fall apart. And I know
I'm not giving up."</TE>

<HD>GardenWalk Soon to Rise in Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The big, mixed-use Disney neighbor will be a
work of 'fusion architecture.' With incentives and approvals in
place, work starts this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six years of stops and starts, developers will begin knocking
down buildings this month to make way for Anaheim GardenWalk, an
ambitious, $600-million project that promises four upscale hotels, an
aquarium, shops and a slate of popular restaurants--all near
Disneyland and the renovated Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Last week the City Council jump-started the project, once known as
Pointe Anaheim, unanimously approving it after sweetening the deal
with revenue incentives and a lease agreement that will cost the city
as much as $30 million over 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   In return, GardenWalk developers say, their project will create
thousands of jobs and generate more than $113 million for the city in
sales and hotel tax revenue.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be the largest project in Anaheim other than Disney,"
said Robert Shelton, manager of pre-development for the project.</TE>
<TE>   "It will provide an additional visitor amenity that will help the
Anaheim resort to extend the length of stay and attract more
convention business to town. From a local perspective, it will
provide ... a great place to take the family out for an evening."</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in an ongoing effort to beef up the Anaheim
resort area, now home to two Disney theme parks and a remade city
convention center that bills itself as the largest on the West Coast
and one of the biggest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, more than $6 billion in public and private money has
been spent to update the Anaheim resort, once known for its campy,
old-fashioned hotels lining Harbor Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "The success of Downtown Disney [a shopping and entertainment
center next to the amusement parks] has proved beyond any doubt that
there is a strong market for shopping and restaurants with varied
entertainment thrown in," said Mayor Tom Daly. "We have wanted more
upscale shopping and restaurants, and this project brings all that
and more."</TE>
<TE>   The city took a major hit in tourism after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks; its bonds were even put on credit watch and city officials
were asked to start making budget cuts. Some analysts and economists
wondered if Anaheim--like Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla.--had become too
tourist-dependent.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to projections, the area is not oversaturated with
hotels and should be able to support new hotels, said Los Angeles
hotel expert Bruce Baltin of PKF Consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Stone, senior vice president for development of the Price
Legacy Corp., which owns Excel Pointe Anaheim LLC, said GardenWalk
will meet the city's needs for a major retail center and luxury
hotels similar to Disney's new Grand Californian.</TE>
<TE>   Price Legacy scrapped original plans for Pointe Anaheim, once
envisioned as a collection of shops, hotels and live theaters.</TE>
<TE>   With two new architecture firms on board--WAT&amp;G and Callison
Architecture--it's been re-themed with lush gardens, waterfalls and
fountains.</TE>
<TE>   They're calling it "fusion architecture." Not exactly Italian or
Spanish or Mediterranean, but a mix of everything. There are plans
for something like the Spanish Steps in Rome, ascending seamlessly
from one level to the next and bordered with plants and flowers.
There might even be a small orange grove, as well as trellises with
climbing bougainvillea.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be like Las Vegas," said architect Greg Coghill of
WAT&amp;G. "It will be a contemporary statement of old-village
expressions."</TE>
<TE>   The project will be built in five phases, said Shelton, the
pre-development manager.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking for the first phase, which includes restaurants and
shops--and possibly the first hotel and the aquarium--could begin in
the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Despite buzz over the new development, one hold-out property owner
could complicate plans. Pyrovest, a California corporation owned by a
billionaire from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who also owns casinos and
the Star and Norwegian cruise lines, holds title to nine acres
planned as part of GardenWalk. Sixteen other property owners already
have sold their land to the developers.</TE>
<TE>   Pyrovest attorney Joel Kew said developers have sold the
GardenWalk concept by billing it as "gate-to-gate promenade
shopping," from the Disneyland main gate to the gates for Disney's
third planned theme park.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pyrovest property, now home to the Anaheim Plaza Hotel &amp;
Suites, is the acreage that links Disneyland to the other land.</TE>
<TE>   "In its current configuration, it's a promenade to nowhere," Kew
said. "Would you ever walk down that portion of a mall that leads to
Nordstrom if Nordstrom isn't there? Disneyland is the ultimate
Nordstrom. That's what people want to walk to. If you can't get
there, then what's the point of promenade shopping?"</TE>
<TE>   Pyrovest and Pointe Anaheim are fighting it out in court. The
developers say they can compel sale based on fraudulent conduct and
breaches of contract. But Kew said he does not believe they have any
legal arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, GardenWalk's first-phase construction will
proceed--with or without the coveted property.</TE>
<TE>   More than $50 million has already been invested in property
acquisition and design plans. Shelton said the developers still hope
they can reach an agreement or win their lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Daly said he also believes an agreement will be reached and
that GardenWalk will eventually help the resort reach its full
potential. Regardless of the legal battles, the city only stands to
gain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not $1 of risk to the city in this project," Daly said.
"If the project never comes out of the ground, it will be a missed
opportunity, but there's no risk."</TE>

<LD>Too late for the Grammy awards but just in time for Tuesday's primary
comes the new, remixed, remastered, re-lyricized "Election Song" from
the world's only folk-bluegrass voter organization, the California
Voter Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The cut is only 86 seconds long and not remotely a dance tune,
unless you count clog dancing, but it packs in a lot about yet more
new twists in the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, we're having an election/March 5th is the day</LD>
<TE>   It's for all the people/In Cali-for-ni-ay</TE>
<TE>   Lots of things are different/Many rules have changed</TE>
<TE>   So if you feel a little lost/Don't think that you're to blame</TE>
<TE>   This song will get you started/The rest is up to you</TE>
<TE>   Democracy's a lot of work/Best left to not too few</TE>
<TE>   This election's a primary/The parties nominate</TE>
<TE>   The one they think will do the best/Of all their candidates</TE>
<TE>   The districts were renumbered/The lines just got redrawn</TE>
<TE>   Your current reps may be elsewhere/When this election's done</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of statewide contests/Their number totals eight</TE>

<TE>   Proposition They'd Like to Refuse</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan has been absent from politics since he announced his
Alzheimer's condition in 1994, but that hasn't kept politicians and
political causes from hooking rides aboard his legacy--this latest
one invoking Reagan's name without his approval.</TE>
<TE>   A mailer favoring Proposition 45, which would let local voters
loosen term limits for their local lawmakers, uses Reagan's smiling
face with the line, "Like President Reagan, Proposition 45 puts its
faith in the voters to make the right decisions for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   We faxed it to Reagan chief of staff Joanne Drake, who says,
"Neither President nor Mrs. Reagan have ever endorsed anyone in a
primary campaign. They are not now actively involved with any
candidate or proposition for [Tuesday's] election."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Jarvis, though, is another matter; 16 years in his grave,
and his picture is still appearing on mailers, shaking his
tax-revolting fist. The latest flier endorses GOP gov candidate Bill
Simon, who, being into education and all as he says he is, is surely
not responsible for the misspelled word "sponsered" right there on
the front.</TE>
<TE>   Confrontation Not on the Pantry Menu</TE>
<TE>   The last roundup of the gov candidates before Tuesday's primary:</TE>
<TE>   When former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan stopped in at his downtown
restaurant, the Pantry, Garry South was out front, waiting. South,
who is the gray matter of Gray Davis' campaign, is always spoiling
for a good ol' political donnybrook, but the moment never happened.
Riordan's staff, knowing he was right outside, hung back and kept
their guy from leaving until the weather report came: all clear--no
South wind.</TE>
<TE>   (Hanging in the Pantry is a picture of Riordan with former Gov.
George Deukmejian in happier times, before Deukmejian said last month
that Riordan "is a man I couldn't vote for.")</TE>
<TE>   As for Bill Simon, despite a rumor to the contrary, he's not
getting a contribution from Don Novey, chief of the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. Novey only showed up for a Simon
event in Sacramento a week ago because he wanted to talk to Rudy
Giuliani, the former New Yawk mayor, and to get his autograph on a
photo of the World Trade Center that Novey had bought at a charity
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, people who recognized Novey got to wondering about
whether that mighty union boss, who saw to it that $2 million got to
Gray Davis' campaign four years ago, was putting body English on the
GOP primary. "Nope. I just wanted to see Rudy. We talked about New
York. I told him about stretching my neck to watch a Mickey Mantle
home run into the third deck."</TE>
<TE>   Novey is less kindly disposed toward Simon; the prison guards
union had set up a tour of a correctional facility, but Novey said
Simon canceled at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   And Bill Jones, who has ranked as the bridesmaid in polls behind
the dueling brides, Riordan and Simon, was in Orange County of late,
still smarting from the pay-per-vote straw poll that Simon won at the
state party convention last month.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's support was bought, Jones charged, by paying college
students $200 each--plus room and board--to become "associate"
members of the party for the day so they could vote. (Riordan
boycotted the straw poll as being stacked to the right.)</TE>
<TE>   New Speaker Hones Comedic Talents</TE>
<TE>   Herb Wesson, the new Assembly speaker and evidently an aspiring
stand-up politician, bore gifts at the Sacramento Press Club last
week: a six-inch Oscar-ish statuette for each reporter with the
inscription, "Herb's Statue to the Critics. You're the Greatest."</TE>
<TE>   Among the laugh lines:</TE>
<TE>   * He hates getting phone calls from Legislative Analyst Elizabeth
Hill, who studies the budget for lawmakers, because "every time I
talk to her, we go deeper in the hole."</TE>
<TE>   * After two weeks as speaker, Wesson noticed that his mustache
sprouted its first gray hair. If this keeps up, he says he'll be
clean-shaven by December.</TE>
<TE>   * Asked whether the Kings would beat the Lakers, the Los Angeles
assemblyman who now rules a state's worth of politicians would only
say that his "two favorite teams are the Lakers and the Kings.... I
can't lose."</TE>
<TE>   No Speedy Boarding, Even for 'Names'</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant governor of California got the twice-over at the
Burbank airport last week.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the boarding pass 1-through-30 group for Southwest
Airlines' 4:10 p.m. flight out of gate A3 to Sacramento, Cruz
Bustamante was flagged for a secondary security check. George
Kostyrko, the communications director for the California Youth
Authority, said that not only could you read the "Lieutenant Governor
Cruz Bustamante" luggage tag from 10 feet away, but hanging right
there on the wall a different 10 feet away was a framed picture of
Bustamante, among other photos on the political frequent-flier hall
of fame.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear, says Kostyrko, that the security workers didn't
recognize Bustamante, but the other fliers did, and all of them were
"watching with interest."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland's City Council turned down a reporting law that would
have clued the public in on how much lobbying groups spent, and what
matters they were trying to influence.</TE>
<TE>   * Sausalito's ballot measure B would say an advisory yea or nay to
plans for a $7.8-million police and fire building. Some residents
object that it's not only out of scale for the waterfront town, but
that it projects bad feng shui.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County, cash cow for the GOP for a quarter-century, has a
champion milk-maker for 2001: Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine),
who collected $243,000 in contributions, followed by Santa Ana
Democratic Assemblyman Lou Correa and Fullerton Republican
Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher, with $227,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   * After protests from some students, First Lady Laura Bush turned
down an invitation to speak at UCLA's spring commencement--but then,
according to her office, she has "declined all commencement
invitations she has received."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Howard Jarvis. And Bill Simon is no Howard Jarvis."</TE>
<TE>   --Gubernatorial candidate and Secretary of State Bill Jones, going
after fellow candidate Simon and reworking the famous line that
Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen delivered about
John F. Kennedy and used on his fellow senator, Republican Dan
Quayle, in the 1988 veep debate.</TE>

<HD>Runners Breeze Through New Marathon Course</HD>
<DH>Race: Flatter route gets good reviews, though no records
are set. One couple ties the knot.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 17th Los Angeles Marathon featured a flatter course, a record
number of competitors, a slew of patriotic displays and even a
wedding ceremony near the 6-mile marker.</LD>
<LD>   But the new course, which eliminated a grueling uphill climb
through Hollywood, failed to produce the records that organizers
envisioned.</LD>
<LD>   More than 23,000 runners from all 50 states and more than 80
countries began the race downtown in the shadow of the future Disney
Concert Hall, which will be home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The
day's athletic fete also included a 25-mile bike tour, a wheelchair
race and a 5-kilometer run/walk.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Ndungu of Kenya won the 26.2-mile race, the first man to
win the race in two consecutive years, with a time of 2:10:27 that
easily beat other elite runners. But Ndungu's time was nearly a
minute off the record set by fellow Kenyan Simon Bor in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's race the winner, Lyubov Denisova of Russia,
recorded a time of 2:28:49, which was more than two minutes off the
race record. Denisova and Ndungu, who both beat their personal best
performances, won $30,000 each and new Honda Accords.</TE>
<TE>   Some runners said the advantages gained by the new course were
erased by the higher temperatures, which topped 60 degrees at the
9:13 a.m. start and climbed past 70 as the event wore on.</TE>
<TE>   "For marathoners, anything over 60 degrees is considered hot, but
the course made a big difference," said Jim O'Brien, 49, track and
cross country coach at Arcadia High School.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Denisova, said they enjoyed the heat or were not
affected by it.</TE>
<TE>   Race officials credited the course design with lowering the number
of people who became ill after crossing the finish line. "The
finishers look really strong," said Marie Patrick, executive vice
president of the L.A. Marathon. "In spite of the heat, it speaks a
lot for the new course. They're tired, but they're not in absolutely
terrible shape. People are looking to be in much better shape
crossing the line than they've been in past years."</TE>
<TE>   Couple Get Hitched Along Route</TE>
<TE>   Runners Brian Gillespie, 48, and Maureen Kennedy, 50, took a
45-minute break from their run to get married. The couple met four
years ago at the L.A. Marathon at Mile Six, and they chose to get
married Sunday at a rose garden near USC along the course.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined at the ceremony by other marathon runners, and
the group then finished the race together in just under six hours.
The ceremony "took a little while and we were getting stiff, but it
was worth it," Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie and Kennedy planned a Mexican food dinner Sunday and a
honeymoon later in the year in Big Sur, where they plan to run a
marathon.</TE>
<TE>   Love, it seems, was in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Spellman, a carpenter from Thousand Oaks, finished the
marathon and then stood on the sidelines waiting for his girlfriend,
Emily Kanney, to catch up. He held up a placard saying, "Emily,
finish the rest of your life with me."</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was really dragging, but obviously that gave me a
huge, huge boost," Kanney said. Spellman then accompanied her across
the finish line, holding his sign and a bouquet of roses.</TE>
<TE>   Two other couples became engaged at the race, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of spectators and family members lined the marathon
route, hoping to motivate friends and relatives. Many hooted,
whistled and screamed in hopes of drawing the attention of a runner,
at least long enough for a quick picture.</TE>
<TE>   Standing along Figueroa Street, spectator Phil Lamar of Simi
Valley caught a sweatshirt hurled at him by his wife, Cynthia,
running in her second marathon. "She's worked her little heart out,"
he said. "It's been a long, long dream."</TE>
<TE>   The race's start was delayed by nearly 30 minutes because police
discovered a suspicious package on Figueroa, near Pico, about 10 to
15 minutes before the scheduled start of the wheelchair race. "We
wanted to look at it well before competitors went by that site," said
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, explaining the delay.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 miles of the 26.2-mile course were new this year
because of the redesign. The course took runners to the farthest
point west in its history, flirting with the border of Beverly Hills,
before heading back to downtown for a finish on Hope Street north of
Olympic Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 of the participants, dubbed the Legacy Runners, had
taken part in all 16 previous L.A. marathons. "After the first one,
they're all easier," said Michael Harris, 42, of Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Racers cited different motivations for running. Four brothers said
they ran in honor of their late brother, Bobby Gutierrez, 38, who
died in 2000 from cancer. Gutierrez died two months after he ran his
last L.A. Marathon. "He just loved to run marathons," brother George
Gutierrez said. "He was the guy to beat all the time."</TE>
<TE>   While personal pride and dedication drove many runners, others
were pushed along this year by a sense of patriotic duty. In a
post-Sept. 11 gesture, runners decked out in their red, white and
blue, some waving giant flags or bearing smaller versions flying from
baseball caps and strollers.</TE>
<TE>   Five-year-old Jaryd Dorsey, clutching his father Earl's hand,
walked the 19th mile in honor of his mother, Dora Menchaca, a
45-year-old Amgen Inc. researcher from Santa Monica who was killed in
the Sept. 11 crash of Flight 77. Menchaca had run in the marathon for
the previous three years.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to do it again," said Denise Menchaca, Dora's
sister-in-law, who handed out Gatorade on the sidelines with her
children. "But she never got the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like that [nostalgic] feeling is in the air this
year," Menchaca said. "Everyone seems to be running for something or
someone."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Draws Strength From Tragedy</TE>
<TE>   New York firefighter Dan Rowan completed the 25-mile bike course
and then ran the marathon. Rowan said he began to feel leg cramps
after a bathroom break late in the marathon. "I was motivated at that
point by thinking about all of the guys we lost. That got me through
it."</TE>
<TE>   But there were those simply there in the name of fun, like the
three Elvis look-alikes pushing their way down Mile 20 along 6th and
Fairfax. Randy Thiele, 45, Jeff Padilla, 52, and Rob McNair, 47, all
wore Elvis Presley garb, complete with large black pompadours, gold
chains and white glittery jumpsuits.</TE>
<TE>   They took turns pushing a stroller with a picture of the King on
the front and a radio blaring his greatest hits inside. "We're here
for the slower runners, to keep up their motivation," said Thiele,
well on his way toward finishing his 12th L.A. Marathon. He's done it
as Elvis every year.</TE>

<HD>2,000 Marines Receive Warm Welcome Home</HD>
<DH>Military: Families greet troops back after a 7-month
deployment that took them to front lines of Afghanistan war.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>CAMP PENDLETON -- With tearful and flag-waving family members waiting
to embrace them, Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit
returned home Sunday after a seven-month overseas deployment that
included service in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "God has answered my prayers and brought my boy home safe," said
Linda Green of Muncie, Ind., sobbing as she hugged her son, Cpl.
Charles Green Jr., who was still toting an M-16 rifle.</LD>
<LD>   Even as he kissed his mother and shook hands with his father,
Green received a cellular telephone call from his fiance in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Green was among 2,000 Marines returning aboard three ships of the
Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group. The vessels, the assault ship Peleliu
and its smaller companion ships, Comstock and Dubuque, will dock
today in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy!" yelled Jeffrey Matthews Jr., 7, as he raced toward his
father, Chief Warrant Officer Jeffrey Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   As Marines climbed out of helicopters, family members strained to
see if their loved one was among the green uniforms. When the answer
was yes, the response was instantaneous.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so happy," said Brittany Williams, 15, niece of Master
Gunnery Sgt. Scott Miller. "Now our lives can be full again, our
family is more complete."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation of home had increased as the ships neared the end of
the long return journey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Dorothy and Toto: There's no place like home," said
Navy Capt. William Jezierski, commodore of the Peleliu group. "And
there's no place like the U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Aug. 13 for a routine deployment in the Arabian Sea
and Western Pacific, the 4,000 Marines and sailors of the Peleliu
group found themselves on the front lines of the war on terrorism
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 25, more than 1,500 of the Marines established a base at
Camp Rhino, an abandoned Taliban facility in the trackless desert of
southern Afghanistan, 400 miles from the Arabian Sea. After Navy
Seabees forged an airstrip, planes and helicopters brought troops and
supplies in a nightly airlift, turning Rhino into a hub for U.S.
military action in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Marine "hunter-killer" teams disrupted and intimidated Taliban and
Al Qaeda forces attempting to flee the battle for the Taliban
stronghold of Kandahar and possibly regroup for a counterattack. The
Marines later took control of the war-ravaged Kandahar airport, 90
miles farther inland, solidifying the hold of anti-Taliban forces.</TE>
<TE>   By pushing so fast and so far inland, the Marines defied
conventional warfare doctrine that, as an amphibious force, the
Marines' effectiveness is largely limited to within 200 miles of the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "You have set the standard by which [other Marine units] will be
judged," Lt. Gen. Michael Hagee, commanding officer of the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force, told the Marines aboard the Peleliu as they
neared Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   If the Marines in Afghanistan set a record, so did the sailors.
The three ships went 139 days in the Arabian Sea without a port call,
weeks longer than usual. The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit--one of
seven such units in the Marines--is set for another six-month
deployment next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy to be home, but we can't just drop our pack and say,
'That's gone forever,'" said Maj. Beau Higgins, an intelligence
officer, who was greeted by his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year we'll be out again--it could be the Philippines,
Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, lots of places," he said. "It's a
strange world out there."</TE>

<HD>S.F. Voter Concerns Surface</HD>
<DH>Turnout: Ballot box lids in bay symbolize lack of
confidence in elections office. No-shows feared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>They have become perverse collector's items, evidence of what many
say are serious problems at City Hall: a dozen ballot box lids found
floating in San Francisco Bay and as far north as Point Reyes 30
miles away.</LD>
<LD>   One of the red plastic lids sits behind the bar at an area
swimming club. Another is kept as a trophy of sorts at a Marin County
weekly newspaper. And two local artists have turned the image of a
third crumpled lid into a poster that reads: "Cast Your Vote ...
Away."</LD>
<LD>   Artist Judith Selby calls her discovery the political version of
finding a body washed up onshore: "You know there's a story here."</LD>
<TE>   As voters in this politically charged city head for the polls
Tuesday, state officials continue their scrutiny of the city's
troubled Department of Elections, probing accusations of vote
tampering and machine politics inside Mayor Willie Brown's
administration.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of embarrassing miscues reminiscent of the 2000
Florida presidential vote, recent San Francisco elections have
featured lost, discarded and miscounted ballots. The missteps have
caused public confidence to plummet and may translate into an
all-time-low voter turnout.</TE>
<TE>   The malaise prompted Secretary of State Bill Jones last year to
launch an investigation into alleged ballot tampering. San Francisco
supervisors have also formed an independent commission to oversee the
vote-count process, beginning with Tuesday's results.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Jones called for sweeping reforms of local election
procedures, pointing to "significant and substantial irregularities"
he characterized as the worst he had ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   But a frustrated Jones--a GOP gubernatorial contender--said last
week that little progress has been made. And he complained of the
city's "stalling and foot-dragging tactics." He laid the blame for
the department's problems "on the doorstep of the mayor and the Board
of Supervisors."</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting with officials last month, he set an April 16
deadline for the city to follow up on its promise to recanvass
324,000 votes that were improperly counted during the November 2000
election.</TE>
<TE>   And Jones said he has yet to rule out fraud within the embattled
department: "I am not at all satisfied with what is going on here."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, ballots for the first time will be guarded by
sheriff's deputies, and state undercover observers may also monitor
polling sites. "Every other California city conducts elections
without such problems," Jones said, "but in San Francisco, there seem
to be other agendas at work."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has had a history of troubled elections and voter
snafus--such as the year wet ballots had to be dried in a microwave.
The secretary of state's office, which oversees state elections, has
intervened in city voting six of the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tony Hall, who helped create the new oversight board,
bristles at city critics. "We're trying to clean up our act here, but
change does not come overnight," Hall said. "Any help we can get is
better than none at all."</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll of 500 city voters found that 31% said they
distrusted local election officials to accurately count the votes.
"That's an extraordinarily high number of people," said San
Francisco-based pollster David Binder, who conducted the survey. "It
shows a serious lack of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco officials blame the mistakes on staff turnover,
which has included five Department of Elections chiefs in seven years
and the loss of numerous lower-level employees with experience. The
city also began a new optical-scan ballot-counting system two years
ago--a change that has added headaches, they say.</TE>
<TE>   City Administrator Bill Lee admitted to "some minor problems," but
said they have been overblown in the "blood-sport world" of local
politics, where activists are quick to cry foul if their measures or
candidates go down to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the floating ballot box lids--63 of them--simply
blew away during a late November storm while being cleaned on a
bay-side pier. A handful were later recovered by local residents and
the U.S. Coast Guard, but many are still missing. There is no proof
that any ballot boxes or actual votes followed them over the side.</TE>
<TE>   "People are using the lost lids to suggest that things are screwed
up here," said Lee, a Brown appointee who hired the last four
elections chiefs. "But has anyone ever proven fraud? Has any vote
ever been thrown out? No. Never."</TE>
<TE>   But elections activists claim the city is trying to soft-pedal its
serious miscues. "It's simply tragic when the people who live in the
most politically active city in the state, if not the entire country,
are left feeling increasingly disenfranchised during their
elections," said Kim Alexander, president of the Sacramento-based
California Voter Foundation. "It's a signal that something is
terribly wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The state investigation began last May after a city elections
official claimed that 3,600 votes cast in the November 2000 election
were unaccounted for and that officials knew the count was inaccurate
when they certified the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors called for an independent federal inquiry into the
department, and state investigators began sifting through ballots.
They later found that all 21 sampled precincts contained ballots that
were tabulated improperly--calling into question the results of
several close races and initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Things got worse last November when Department of Elections chief
Tammy Haygood, hired based on her experience as a quality control
engineer for a diaper manufacturer, removed several hundred absentee
ballots from City Hall for counting--a move she called a
precautionary measure after the September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, elections officials discovered that 240 marked
and uncounted ballots had found their way inside voting machine
storage bins. Officials also acknowledged that a temporary poll
worker walked off with 200 blank ballots and then failed to show up
for work on voting day.</TE>
<TE>   Lee said blank ballots are routinely distributed to poll workers
prior to election day. But the worker had suddenly committed himself
for treatment at a local psychiatric facility, and officials were
unable to retrieve the ballots from his downtown hotel room without a
court order.</TE>
<TE>   Several missing ballots were recovered from atop a downtown trash
can. "This guy had worked for us for three years without a problem,"
Lee said. "How were we to know? But this kind of blameless thing has
given us a black eye."</TE>
<TE>   Activists wonder just how blameless such events are.</TE>
<TE>   "People watching San Francisco from a distance are beginning to
wonder: 'Is this just one blunder after another or a series of
mistakes that signals deeper problems?'" Alexander said. "'Is this a
public agency that has been deliberately kept incompetent so that it
can be manipulated by local politicians?'"</TE>
<TE>   Alexander said the recent election miscues were causing ripple
effects in local politics. "It's not just the voters but people who
have been politically active for many years who are growing cynical,"
she said. "Many are questioning their future participation."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran activist Ross Mirkarimi, who is also a private
investigator, had campaigned for two public power initiatives that
were both narrowly defeated in last November's election--one by 533
votes.</TE>
<TE>   Like others, Mirkarimi wonders whether the election was stolen.
"Even if investigators haven't found the smoking gun of fraud, they
have revealed a pattern of incidents that deflates the public trust.
And that's just as bad."</TE>
<TE>   Mirkarimi said he now feels embarrassed for San Francisco. "People
now refer to us as Little Florida. And that spells trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Central to the controversy has been the turnover within the
Department of Elections and its revolving door of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Haygood, the most recent elections chief, is an attorney and
quality control engineer at a computer company and a diaper
manufacturing plant. Lee said she was nonetheless considered the best
of seven applicants--none with election experience.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew everything about making diapers," Lee said. "She had
this attention to detail that I felt translated to the elections job.
Before you can issue voters pamphlets, you need to know how things
fit together."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Conny McCormack said San
Francisco--with its high turnover--is seen as a questionable career
move. "Clearly, no one I knew applied," she said. "People see how
registrars have been treated there. There's no support. This is a
high-stress job, and you are going to make mistakes. But in San
Francisco, there seems to be no room for error. Who wants a job like
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Hall hopes the new elections oversight commission can
restore voter confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finally trying to make corrections after years and years of

politically influenced since the Gold Rush days. "So it's going to
take a little while to educate people that, yes, their vote does
count and, yes, we do want them to vote."</TE>

<HD>A Home Video's Heavy Price in a New Era</HD>
<DH>Law: Filming Santa Ana federal building gets illegal
immigrant noticed by FBI. Now deportation looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ice cream vendor never imagined that the FBI would be interested
in his home video of downtown Santa Ana. He was not thinking
post-Sept. 11, an era of new sensitivity about anyone taking pictures
of federal buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Vasquez, a Mexican immigrant, filmed the Ronald Reagan
Federal Building for a video he wanted to send to relatives back
home. But the activity was brought to the attention of federal
authorities who discovered he was an illegal immigrant and now plan
to deport him.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said Vasquez is just one of thousands of people
interviewed after Sept. 11 on grounds that they may know something
about terrorist activity. With the new vigilance, activities near
government offices that were once considered innocuous now often
catch the attention of law enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a heightened sensitivity to anyone filming federal
buildings. This sensitivity was not there before Sept. 11," said
Matthew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez, 35, said he included Santa Ana's federal building, at 411
W. 4th St., in his video because it was part of the city's skyline.
The video was taken with the most expensive item he's bought since
coming to the United States in 1990: a $1,200 camera bought on a
payment plan at Circuit City.</TE>
<TE>   While he was outside the building Dec. 6, he said, his filming was
stopped by security guards and he was interviewed by Santa Ana
police, who wrote down his driver's license. On Dec. 11, FBI agents
were at his doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Within three weeks, Vasquez was sent to an immigration detention
center in Lancaster for one month, then released on bond.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said he came to the United States 11 years ago and was
hoping to become a legal resident. He said he had submitted an
application for residency through his brother, who is a citizen, in
April. He put his earnings at $250 a week selling ice cream from a
1976 van.</TE>
<TE>   "What really hurts is the injustice and discrimination," said
Vasquez, in the room he rents for $350 a month in Santa Ana. "I came
here to work and make money to survive."</TE>
<TE>   But McLaughlin said other people who have been questioned for
possible terrorist activity have also been referred to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service if they could not prove legal
residency.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and Pentagon, Middle Eastern immigrants who came to
authorities' attention as possible suspects also were targeted for
deportation if they were found to be in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official said Vasquez's deportation case is not about
whether he videotaped a building but whether he is in the country
legally.</TE>
<TE>   "I would put the onus back on the individual. If he wanted to stay
in the U.S., he should have gotten legal status," McLaughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have set protocols. He is not being singled out. He was taking
video of a federal building. You do not know what his intent is until
you investigate."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said the FBI interrogated him on five occasions,
repeatedly asking him whether he knew a man who he believes is of
Middle Eastern descent. Vasquez said he knew the man only by sight
from his visits to a store where he bought ice cream for his truck.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said he was given several lie detector tests. INS records
show that he failed two polygraph tests administered by the FBI.
Vasquez said he believes he failed because the questioner kept
rephrasing a question--whether he knew the man from the ice cream
store and whether he was asked by another person to film the
building--until he answered incorrectly.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin said Vasquez was not forced to be interviewed and that
the lie detector tests were voluntary. At any time, Vasquez could
have stopped the interview or test, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights advocates say the case demonstrates how the new
vigilance can usurp personal freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an example of the kind of overaction and reaction that
violates human rights day in and day out now," said James Lafferty,
executive director of the National Lawyers Guild in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration authorities took Vasquez's driver's license, so he has
been unable to work. The driver's license was obtained legally,
before the state required drivers to show a Social Security number to
get one.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Juan Vasquez, 33, a U.S. citizen, has been helping
pay for food.</TE>
<TE>   "They did him a lot of harm," he said. "It's an extreme. What they
did seems like it's outside the rule of law."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Legislature this week gave the green light for an audit of
the California Department of Transportation that looks at
construction delays and design flaws of a median strip built along
California 33 in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) requested the
audit after hearing complaints from constituents about delays,
problems with contractors and unsound performance bonds. The
three-mile concrete barrier runs from West Main Street to Crooked
Palm Road in Ventura. It replaced a metal barrier.</LD>
<LD>   The audit will try to determine the reason for the delays and cost
overruns and how to prevent similar problems in the future, Jackson
said.</LD>

<HD>Maryland's Rout Closes Cole Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About the only thing that didn't go according to plan was the
net-cutting ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Long after No. 2-ranked Maryland ended its 47-year stay in storied
Cole Field House at College Park, Md., with a 112-92 rout of Virginia
on Sunday night, each player climbed a ladder to cut down the net in
front of the Terrapins' bench.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Dixon sliced off the last cord, then realized that Coach Gary
Williams was still behind him. So Dixon knotted the severed cord to
the rim, and Williams ended the emotional night with one last snip.</LD>
<TE>   Williams had no complaints, though, because Maryland finished 15-0
at home and concluded the best regular season in school history with
a runaway victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way it's supposed to be," Williams said. "Everyone
got into the game, and the crowd was great."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon scored 23 points, Chris Wilcox had 21 points and 11 rebounds
and Lonny Baxter had 18 points for the Terrapins (25-3, 15-1 in the
Atlantic Coast Conference), who will move across campus next season
into the new $101-million Comcast Center.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a Maryland alum, said his fondest memory of Cole was
"sitting in Section Q and passing two exams to get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Cole Field House will remain a place where students take exams and
receive their diplomas, but college basketball fans will remember it
as the site two Final Fours (1966 and 1970) and some classic ACC
games.</TE>
<TE>   In the finale, Maryland took the lead for good midway through the
first half and cruised to its 12th consecutive victory, eclipsing the
22-3 regular-season record in 1974-75.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Williams scored a season-high 28 points and Travis Watson
had 20 for Virginia (17-10, 7-9).</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Kansas 95, Missouri 92--Nick Collison had 28 points at
Columbia, Mo., and the Jayhawks (27-2, 16-0) became the first team to
go unbeaten in the Big 12's six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks enter the Big 12 tournament with a 14-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Gilbert had 23 points for Missouri (20-10, 9-7), which
led, 92-91, after Arthur Johnson's three-point play made with 1:57 to
go.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Duke 93, North Carolina 68--Jason Williams scored 23 of his
37 points in the first half at Durham, N.C. and the Blue Devils
(26-3, 13-3 in the ACC) finished 13-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had eight three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Capel matched his career-high with 28 points for the North
Carolina (8-19, 4-12). Duke will try to hand North Carolina a
school-record 20th loss in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament
Friday night at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Cincinnati 80, Memphis 75--Steve Logan scored 30 points and
hit a floating jumper that sent the game to overtime, and the
Bearcats (27-3, 14-2 in Conference USA) rallied for the victory at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati has won or shared each of the conference's seven
regular-season titles and earned the top seed for all seven
conference tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Dajuan Wagner had 27 points for Memphis (22-8, 12-4), which took a
68-66 lead on Antonio Burks' two free throws with 6.9 seconds left in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi 84, No. 6 Alabama 56--David Sanders scored a
career-high 23 points for the Rebels (20-9, 9-7 in the Southeastern
Conference at Oxford, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (24-6, 12-4)matched its second-lowest point total this
season and committed 26 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Illinois 67, Minnesota 66--Frank Williams made a driving
layup with 2.9 seconds left to cap a 10-0 game-closing run at
Minneapolis and give the Fighting Illini (23-7, 11-5) a share of the
four-way tie for the Big Ten title with Indiana, Ohio State and
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 66-63 with 12 seconds left, the Illini tied up the
Gophers underneath their basket but the possession arrow kept the
ball with Minnesota. After Kevin Burleson lost control, Cory Bradford
picked up the loose ball and made a jumper from the free throw line
to pull the Illinois within 66-65.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with Minnesota (16-11, 9-7) trying to get the ball past
halfcourt on its next possession, Illinois cornered Burleson again.
His pass to Dusty Rychart sailed out of bounds, giving Illinois
possession on the base line with 6.9 seconds left and setting the
stage Williams' winning basket--his only one of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Greer had 32 of his 36 points in the second half and made a
14-foot jumper with 1.2 seconds left in the second overtime to lift
Temple over Saint Joseph's, 87-84, at Philadelphia. Temple (15-13,
12-4 in the Atlantic 10) gained the top seed in the conference's East
Division....Kenny Walls and Troy Bell each scored 15 points and
Boston College (19-10, 8-8 Big East) kept its postseason hopes alive
with a 69-65 victory at Syracuse (20-10, 9-7).</TE>
<TE>   TOURNAMENTS</TE>
<TE>   Horizon: At Cleveland, Louis Smith scored a career-high 20 points
and Loyola of Chicago defeated Wisconsin-Green Bay, 63-57, in a
semifinal at Cleveland. Illinois-Chicago (19-13)-- a 79-68 winner
over Detroit--plays Loyola in Tuesday's final.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Valley: Marcus Belcher's 19 points helped Southern
Illinois (26-6) beat Southwest Missouri State, 86-63, in a semifinal
at St. Louis. Southern Illinois plays Creighton (21-8)--a 90-63
winner over Illinois State--in tonight's final.</TE>
<TE>   Southern--In the final at North Charleston, S.C., Peter Anderer
scored 22 points to lead Davidson (21-9) past Furman, 62-57, to its
second NCAA tournament appearance in four years.</TE>

<LD>UP NEXT, Wednesday at Atlanta, 4:30 p.m.--The Thrashers are 2-6-1-1
in their last 10 games. They are one of two teams without a winning
record that the Ducks play in the last 19 games. Atlanta's IIya
Kovalchuk is the front-runner for the Calder Trophy, given to the
NHL's top rookie. He has 28 goals and 49 points. Center Tony Hrkac,
who the Ducks did not re-sign last summer, is having a solid season,
with 13 goals and 31 points. The Ducks need 15 points to avoid having
their worst season in a non-lockout year. They had 65 points in the
1997-98 season</LD>

<DH>Gonzaga: Location doesn't please coach, but Bulldogs stop
San Diego, 87-79, in semifinal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The road to the NCAA tournament--or at least to the West Coast
Conference's automatic bid--goes through the University of San
Diego's home court.</LD>
<LD>   And Gonzaga Coach Mark Few--his ticket to the NCAA tournament
already punched--was fuming Sunday that his team had to play San
Diego on the Toreros' floor in Gonzaga's hard-fought 87-79 semifinal
victory at Jenny Craig Pavilion, claiming he considered pulling his
team out of the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "To overcome all that and the position this ridiculous league put
us in to come in here and play a home game on their court after being
seventh in the country ... I give an unbelievable amount of credit to
our guys," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be honest, I thought long and hard about not bringing our
team here. There's no reason for us to be here. We're in the NCAA
tournament. We don't need to come down here and play on other
people's floor and play with white jerseys on."</TE>
<TE>   Few is distressed at the thought of 28-3 Gonzaga's RPI and seeding
sinking as it plays the conference tournament, and at Pepperdine
risking its strong position to be picked.</TE>
<TE>   For all Gonzaga's famous NCAA tournament success, the WCC
tournament has been no cakewalk--and tonight's final against
Pepperdine, a 68-47 winner over St. Mary's, should be the latest
battle.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga made the Sweet 16 last year only after surviving a shot at
the buzzer by Santa Clara that could have tied the game, and made the
Sweet 16 two years ago by beating Pepperdine in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego (16-13) has been the Bulldogs' semifinal opponent the
last two years, and the Toreros gave Gonzaga quite a game Saturday,
taking a 47-40 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Morris didn't miss a shot in the first half, going five for
five from the field, three for three from three-point range and two
for two from the line to score 15 of his 19 points in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Laws was the Toreros' other leader, scoring 21 points on
eight-of-26 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga's Dan Dickau wasn't at his best, scoring 22 points with
five three-pointers but missing five threes in a row at one point,
including an air ball.</TE>
<TE>   It was Blake Stepp who stepped up and made the big shot, a
three-pointer from 25 feet that turned a two-point lead to five with
50 seconds left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I generally shoot it all the way out there," said Blake, who
finished with 26 points, six rebounds and three assists. "I try to
get up to the line sometimes because Coach Few gets mad at me."</TE>
<TE>   It was a scintillating game, but it took a backseat to Few's
complaints afterward.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would have preferred to play on No. 1 seed Pepperdine's
home court or a neutral site, and objected to the fact Gonzaga has
never hosted the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It was also played at San Diego last year, and previously had been
at Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran reacted to Few's rant by noting
that the school presidents determine the site, and pointing out the
financial difficulties "based on money, airline and hotel realities
and history."</TE>
<TE>   The conference's executive committee recently recommended to the
presidents that the tournament return to San Diego for two more
years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to say get us a neutral site. It's harder to do,"
Gilleran said, explaining that coaches weren't enthusiastic about
what was considered the only viable alternative site, the San Diego
Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   As for Few's claim he considered not competing, Gilleran said, "To
me, that's not within the realm of reasonable behavior. I prefer not
to give credence to an unreasonable position."</TE>
<TE>   He has supported a 'merit' system as Few does, putting the
tournament on the homecourt of the regular-season champion, but it
would be somewhat impractical to promote a tournament that this year,
for instance, would have been at Pepperdine in a decision determined
on the final game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Coach Brad Holland wasn't complaining about the site.</TE>
<TE>   "Five out of my eight years it's been at Santa Clara, one year at
Loyola and two years here....</TE>
<TE>   "Me personally, I'm happy the conference tournament is here."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time the Kings squared off against the Ottawa Senators, Dec.
20 at Ottawa, a hockey game broke out.</LD>
<LD>   But only after a second-period brawl that resulted in 174 minutes
in penalties and the ejection of six players, among them goaltenders
Felix Potvin of the Kings and Jani Hurme of the Senators, did the
Kings emerge with a 4-2 victory.</LD>
<LD>   King interim Coach Dave Tippett, however, is not looking for a
repeat when the teams play again tonight at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about the points; it's not about grudges," Tippett said.
"Ottawa's a very good hockey team and if we come in thinking that
it's going to be a fight rather than play the game--we can't think
that....</TE>
<TE>   "Hockey's an emotional game. It was just one of those things."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Allison, Kelly Buchberger, Ian Laperriere and Adam Deadmarsh
of the Kings all earned major penalties for fighting at Ottawa,
precipitated by what the Kings believed was thuggish treatment of
Allison. And that was before the main event, which featured the rare
sight of goaltenders Potvin and Hurme trading punches.</TE>
<TE>   All 12 players on the ice at the time were involved in the
second-period melee. Allison, one leg draped over the boards, was
restrained by several of his teammates from joining the fray but
nobody bothered with rookie Adam Mair, who earned an automatic
10-game suspension when he left the bench and jumped into a fight.</TE>
<TE>   After a 20-minute delay, Potvin, Hurme and Mair had been ejected,
as had Jaroslav Modry of the Kings and Andre Roy and Chris Neil of
the Senators.</TE>
<TE>   The game then played out without incident, the Kings outscoring
the Senators, 3-1.</TE>

the NHL, are only 23rd best at home with a record of 13-12-4-1 after
Saturday's surprising 2-0 loss to the last-place Columbus Blue
Jackets. The Kings have not lost consecutive games since
mid-November.</TE>

<HD>Van Dyk Breaks 5-Year Streak</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernst Van Dyk of South Africa ended the longest winning streak in Los
Angeles Marathon history Sunday when he held off five-time defending
champion Saul Mendoza of Mexico to win the men's wheelchair division.</LD>
<LD>   Van Dyk, 28, finished in 1 hour 28 minutes 44 seconds. Mendoza,
35, finished second, also in 1:28:44. Kaige Schabort of South Africa,
38, was third in 1:28:45.</LD>
<LD>   The result was not entirely unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   Mendoza, who lives and trains in Texas, is outstanding at climbing
hills. But this year's course was changed to a flatter layout that
favored Van Dyk, who last year finished second behind Mendoza in Los
Angeles and won at Boston. Van Dyk proved as fast off the course as
he was on it, skipping the post-race news conference to catch a
flight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very tactical race," Mendoza said. "At mile 10, I
attacked up the hill and put a small gap between myself and the pack.
But there was a big downhill and they caught up after that."</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Ariadne Hernandez of Mexico won the women's
race in 1:55:01.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyk and Hernandez each won $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The start of the wheelchair race, scheduled to begin at 8:20 a.m.,
was delayed about 40 minutes as the Los Angeles Police Department
bomb squad investigated a suspicious-looking package near Figueroa
Street and Pico Boulevard, Police Chief Bernard Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "The package was sitting on a sidewalk and was identified by some
of our officers," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a box that was taped. There was not any type of device in
it. But it was in a very suspicious place and warranted our
attention."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   William Burke, president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc., said a
record 22,107 runners were at the start line for the marathon.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record was 21,035 set last year. Burke said he was
pleased by the spectator turnout along the reconfigured route.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived in abject fear that because it was an 80% new course,
people would not come out," Burke said. "But the streets were lined
with people. We are eternally grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Burke said 17,800 participated in the bicycle tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Ndungu became the first runner to win consecutive men's
titles in the L.A. Marathon when he ran a career-best 2 hours 10
minutes 27 seconds, but he realizes he has a long way to go before he
is regarded as one of the best marathoners in Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many runners who are better in the marathon than us,"
Ndungu said at a post-race news conference with countrymen Raymond
Kipkoech Chemwelo and Benson Mbithi. "Many runners with better times
by far. But we do wish to be part of them."</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate Ndungu's point, consider that William Tanui holds
the Kenyan record in the marathon at 2:06:16, and 14 Kenyans have
broken 2:08.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Ndungu, Kipkoech Chemwelo, Mbithi, Noah Bor and James Kuria
Karanja took the top five places in Sunday's race, it marked the
second time in three years that Kenyans swept the top five spots.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyans took the top four places last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With career bests of 13:33.84 in the 5,000 meters and 28:14.38 in
the 10,000, Julio Valle of Mexico was regarded as a runner to watch
in his marathon debut Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He was never among the leaders, however, and finished 15th in
2:29:36.</TE>
<TE>   Valle ran the first half of the race in 1:06:58, but the second
half took him 1:22.38.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Ndungu is the first man to win consecutive titles at the
L.A. Marathon, there has been a male winner to win more than once.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Art Boileau won in 1987 and again two years later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Gary Klein and John Ortega, and the Associated
Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Lleyton Hewitt's return to tennis tested his stamina, both mentally
and physically.</LD>

to beat Andre Agassi, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4), in the Siebel Open final
Sunday in San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Second-seeded Agassi, playing in his first tournament of the year
after a wrist injury, had won the San Jose tournament four times.
Hewitt was playing his first tournament since losing in the first
round of the Australian Open after a bout with chickenpox.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi was also playing his first tournament under new coach
Darren Cahill, Hewitt's old coach.</TE>

<KH>TENNIS LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>Sampras Finally Calls on the Clay Master</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They came close to getting together before it finally happened, a
series of near misses. The pairing seemed ideal, and in the final
scene, potential and promise seem to be realized.</LD>
<LD>   This happens in the movies all the time, and it unfolded quite
winningly in a small 1998 art-house film, "Next Stop Wonderland."
Still, why-can't-they-get-together isn't limited to movies. For those
who watched one certain tennis star struggle on slow surfaces
throughout the world for years, a call to a respected Spanish
clay-court guru residing at Mission Hills seemed a no-brainer.</LD>
<LD>   And so, about 15 years after Pete Sampras first stayed at the home
of the clay master, he placed the phone call. He acted, shortly after
playing Davis Cup against Slovakia last month.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously I would have liked to have had the call five years
ago," Jose Higueras said.</TE>
<TE>   Another teenager was with Sampras when they trained with Higueras
and stayed at his home in the '80s. It was Michael Chang, who went on
to win the French Open in 1989 under Higueras.</TE>
<TE>   There's a line missing from Sampras' legendary resume: French Open
champion. The unexpected joining of forces last week with Higueras,
after a short spell with Tom Gullikson, signals, at long last, a
commitment to solving the mystery of clay, of taking a thoughtful
approach to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to me," Sampras said. "There are no magic pills out
there, no guarantees. It's nice talking to Jose. He knows what a lot
of clay courters are thinking out there, much more than I do, because
he was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It had crossed my mind. Obviously, I never pulled the trigger for
whatever reason."</TE>
<TE>   Higueras was blunt with Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Listen, I believe in God, but I don't do miracles,'"
Higueras said. "My belief is to work. I know he's going to play with
me more hours than he's used to playing normally. My main goal is for
him to get a little better.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, he is fine and eager to keep playing. If his game
gets a little better at this level, not 40%, but five percent may be
the difference for him to start winning the way he was before."</TE>
<TE>   Higueras will be a busy man, working with Sampras and retaining
his coaching job with the USTA. He won't be with Sampras at this
week's tour stop, the Franklin Templeton Classic in Scottsdale, Ariz.
(Sampras plays a qualifier in the first round and could face Andre
Agassi in the semifinals).</TE>
<TE>   Sampras' first event with Higueras will be the Pacific Life Open
at Indian Wells, which, for the men, starts next Monday. Sampras and
Higueras had practice sessions last week at UCLA and at Mission Hills
Country Club in Rancho Mirage. Apparently, there is a substantial
difference between an ordinary practice and a Higueras practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He told Jose, 'That's one of the hardest workouts I've ever
had,'" said Tommy Tucker of Mission Hills. "That's nothing. He won't
be at a lot of Laker games if he does what he's supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Higueras isn't promising overnight results; he's taking a
long-term view. No one is predicting the 30-year-old Sampras will be
winning the Italian Open and contending deep into the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes some time to adjust, to assimilate things, to know what
the surface can do for you," he said. "If Pete is healthy and can
play another five years, he'll be a much better clay-court player in
two, three years than he is now.''</TE>
<TE>   Higueras is no Bobby Knight. But ...</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't need to be," Sampras said. "He's not a yeller or a
screamer but if you are not doing the work, he will say something.
And he hates unforced errors."</TE>
<TE>   The contract between Sampras and Higueras is simple. Higueras
won't travel with him to every tournament and there is no piece of
paper sealing their agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you a secret," Higueras said. "I've never signed a
contract with anybody, not Jim Courier in seven years and not Todd
Martin in 10. The main reason is I don't want to be tied to them and
by the same token, them to be tied to me. So far it has worked good
for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I stay with Pete until he retires, that's my goal."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gullikson had hoped his partnership with Sampras would last
longer, certainly more than two tournaments. Gullikson and Sampras
said the split was amicable. After all, they hold a close bond. Tom's
twin brother, Tim, who died in 1996, was Sampras' close friend and
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sampras: "As far as Tom's concerned, we decided to go our
separate directions."</TE>
<TE>   Gullikson, quite naturally, was disappointed at the turn of
events, objecting to Sampras' term "trial period" to describe the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have never accepted the job on a trial basis," Gullikson
said. "There was a four-month out clause that went both ways. At no
time did he ever mention he was dissatisfied with my coaching in any
way."</TE>
<TE>   That never came across in his conversations with Gullikson. In
fact, Sampras praised Gullikson's enthusiasm in an interview last
week. What he told Gullikson and reiterated was that he wanted to
keep the friendship and coaching relationship separate.</TE>
<TE>   "That's fair with me," said Gullikson. "I'll be friends with him a
lot longer than I would have been his coach. In my opinion we were
just getting started. At the end of the day, Pete's got to do what's
best for him and that's fine by me."</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Wins Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In the span of a few jubilant minutes Sunday, Sarah Richen seized the
championship placard, hoisted the championship trophy and expressed
what it meant for Pepperdine to finally win the West Coast Conference
women's tournament title.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a dream come true," said the senior forward.</LD>
<LD>   And it's not over.</LD>
<TE>   Top-seeded Pepperdine earned the WCC's automatic berth in the NCAA
tournament by pulling away in the final three minutes for an 81-77
victory over second-seeded Santa Clara in the conference final before
1,181 at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Richen's three-point basket from the baseline gave the Waves the
lead for good, 69-66, with 2:47 to play. Seconds later, guard
Shandrika Lee made it a five-point lead with a steal and layup.</TE>
<TE>   But the Waves couldn't breathe easily until Nadja Morgan made two
free throws with 0.7 on the clock to account for the final margin,
after Santa Clara guard Becki Ashbaugh kept the Broncos within
striking range by scoring eight points in the last 12.4 seconds,
including two three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "Either team could have won this game," said Pepperdine Coach Mark
Trakh.</TE>
<TE>   Though Pepperdine (23-7) went without a field goal for the final
2:30, the Waves maintained the lead down the stretch by making 10 of
14 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, a 6-foot-2 senior forward, led Pepperdine with 22 points
and 13 rebounds. Junior guard Damaris Hinojosa, the tournament most
valuable player, had 12 points on four three-pointers, three at
critical junctures of the second half. Lee scored 15 points, Richen
13 and center Shannon Mayberry 10.</TE>
<TE>   After losing in the WCC final in 1999 and 2000, Morgan said it was
satisfying to win the school's first tournament title. It will be
Pepperdine's second NCAA tournament appearance. "We've been here
three of four years," Morgan said of the seniors. "For us to get the
championship, that makes our season."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: 1,000 WORDS' WORTH: Finally, Flying Cars: It looks like Ralf

<HD>Riordan Hopes Lie Where GOP's Past, Present Meet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WALNUT CREEK, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>If former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan beats businessman Bill
Simon Jr. and Secretary of State Bill Jones tomorrow in the race for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination, it will be because he carried places
like Contra Costa County.</LD>
<LD>   If he loses, it will be because GOP voters here and their brethren
statewide believed that he wasn't one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Walnut Creek, one of Contra Costa County's two biggest towns, sits at
the junction of two Republican traditions that Riordan is attempting to
straddle.</LD>
<TE>   Once an agricultural area built around walnut orchards, the town
absorbed the deeply conservative views of the party's right wing. More
recently, Walnut Creek has become home to the overflow suburban
population spilling out of the Bay Area. Affluence has moderated some of
the social conservatism of the region, but Republican leaders here remain
unwavering in their fiscal views.</TE>
<TE>   It is the kind of place where Riordan's vision of a fiscally
disciplined GOP with room for abortion and gay rights is supposed to find
a welcome reception.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan was little known in Northern California until three months
ago, and the impression that many leading residents have formed of the
former mayor is culled from the contentious, unusual three-way race waged
in recent months by Riordan, Simon and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. Now,
with the primary campaign ending, some see Riordan as their best chance
to defeat Davis in November. But others complain that he simply does not
share their views.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't waffle on my principles," said Kris Lesher-Aring, 34,
state chairwoman of the Young Republican Federation. "I'm impressed with
somebody who will get on TV and say he's a conservative Republican."</TE>
<TE>   As for Riordan, she said, "I'm not comfortable voting for someone who
has supported as many Democrats as he has, including the man he would be
running against in the fall."</TE>
<TE>Appealing to Pragmatists</TE>
<TE>   Simon's state chairman, John Herrington, lives in the area and said he
believes that those views are widely shared.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done focus groups here and they are strongly anti-tax," said
Herrington, who owns a steakhouse known as Vic Stewart's. "There are very
few people here who think the public school system is doing as well as it
could."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives here complain that Riordan needed to do more than
persuade them that he is the best candidate to take on Davis in the fall.
He had to make the case that he's the best Republican, they said. And
some argue that he has not.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Meredith, 68, worked for a state assemblyman and now is a Simon
supporter. She, too, sees Riordan's moderate views as a drawback, not an
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have someone in the governor's office who I don't agree
with," she said. "If he won and doesn't represent my point of view, then
why would I vote for him in the first place?"</TE>
<TE>   Walnut Creek Mayor Sue Rainey has an answer for Meredith: Riordan, she
said, could bring the Republicans a long-sought victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thrilled at some of the things he's done in support of some
Democrats, but it also proves he can work within the system and work with
both sides," said Rainey, who is the county co-chairwoman of Riordan's
campaign. "I think that Republicans have too often gone to the far right
and we don't win."</TE>
<TE>   Paula Miller, who was the campaign manager for Rainey's husband,
former state Sen. Richard Rainey, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel he's a person who is strong enough to beat Davis," she said.
"The pro-choice thing is big to me--not that I would vote on that, but
when you run against a Democrat, it's important."</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, pragmatism is a notion most advanced by party
activists in Walnut Creek. It rarely is raised in the conversations about
the race at the softball games in Civic Park and the boutiques in the
downtown shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan "is someone who thinks the only way the Republican Party can
win is if the conservative arm didn't exist," said Mackenzie Niles, 25,
on Friday as she finished another day of teaching fourth-graders at Buena
Vista Elementary School. "Every time I hear him talk about how
destructive conservatives are to the Republican Party, I'm offended."</TE>
<TE>   Niles said she's "never supported one of those new-to-politics
millionaires" like Simon. But, she added, "I like what he has to say."</TE>
<TE>   Although polls suggest that Riordan and Simon are far ahead of Jones
statewide, the secretary of state does have some support in Walnut Creek.</TE>
<TE>   The Contra Costa Times endorsed him Friday, calling him "a known
quantity" with a record of success in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Jones has proven he can work at the state level," echoed Gary Dahl,
68, as he waited to mail a package at the post office near Rossmoor, the
sprawling retirement community on the southwest edge of town. "Simon's a
businessman, and I don't think he could do it. He doesn't impress
me--although I'd like to be as rich as he is."</TE>
<TE>Many Still Undecided</TE>
<TE>   Settling in for a haircut at DiMaggio's Barber Shop on Main Street,
Bob Morris agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Jones," said Morris, a retired contractor. "He seems like an
honest type of guy, and doesn't try to collect a lot of money for his
campaign. I guess he doesn't have a chance. But I'll still vote for him."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Motta, the barber, thinks otherwise--and his explanation
suggests another reason why inroads here have been hard for Riordan to
make.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going for Simon, because I'm a Republican and I vote Republican,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Riordan, "I don't want the L.A. power coming up north," Motta
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Walnut Creek's general activism--two-thirds of its 64,000
residents are registered voters, half Republican, half Democrat--there
are many who approach Election Day still undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "I just haven't looked at any of the campaign stuff yet," said student
Susan Muller, 35, as she sat with a friend at the edge of a playground in
Civic Park in the quiet of Friday morning, watching her friend's
4-year-old daughter play in the sand. When she does, Muller said, she'll
check out the endorsements each candidate has.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely took notice that [former New York Mayor Rudolph]
Giuliani was backing . . . " she paused, "it's Simon, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Will Amen, a sales manager at an Internet company, hadn't made up his
mind, either. He said he is not preoccupied with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "To be perfectly honest," he said, looking at the green sloping hills
of the Diablo Hills Golf Course lighted golden by the late afternoon
light, "I'm just trying to think about how I can birdie this first hole."</TE>
<TE>   For the candidates--and Riordan in particular--these still-wavering
voters in this vote-rich region exert a powerful pull in the final hours
of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan kicks off his last day of campaigning this morning in Walnut
Creek, where he plans to shake hands with commuters at the local BART
station.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bombers Pound Al Qaeda Mountain Lair</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Military shifts strategy to air after ground assault
meets fierce resistance. Several American helicopters are damaged by
enemy fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. bombers hammered Al Qaeda positions deep in the mountains of
eastern Afghanistan for a second day Sunday after an attempted ground
assault on the area was repulsed.</LD>
<LD>   The ongoing attack--which U.S. officials say is the largest joint
ground offensive of the war, involving hundreds of Afghan government
soldiers as well as U.S. troops--is encountering heavy resistance from Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</LD>
<LD>   The Al Qaeda forces have fortified their positions in the rugged
mountains and cave complexes in Paktia province, south of Kabul, the
Afghan capital, according to local commanders and Afghan intelligence
sources.</LD>
<TE>   No major ground action was reported Sunday. One Afghan commander said
that the Americans had shifted their strategy after encountering heavy
resistance from the Al Qaeda troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans wanted to start with a ground attack, but as soon as they
had casualties they changed their mind and they've just been bombing,"
said Wazir Khan, who is helping to lead a 600-man contingent that is
attacking the hide-out from the south.</TE>
<TE>   At least one U.S. soldier and five Afghans died during the first day
of fighting. Officials at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., said in a
written statement Sunday that "an unspecified number of U.S. and Afghan
forces have been injured." The U.S. officials described all of the
American injuries as "non-life-threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Gardez, the city nearest to the fighting, could see
streams of black smoke rising from snowy mountains and hear the constant
drone of bombers overhead.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Central Command statement, no American aircraft had
been shot down, although some AH-64 Apache helicopters were damaged by
enemy fire. The statement said that, from 6:30 a.m. Afghan time Saturday
through Sunday, "more than 270 bombs have been dropped in support of
Afghan, U.S. and coalition forces."</TE>
<TE>   Targets have included enemy troops, caves, vehicles, mortars and
antiaircraft artillery sites. Among the coalition nations participating
in the fighting near Gardez are Norway, Germany, Canada, Australia,
France and Denmark, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain how many Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are hidden in
the mountain region. The area is large, and some estimates before the
fighting began put the figure at about 600. But Sunday, some people were
saying there could be as many as 2,000, Wazir Khan said. The cave complex
where they are hiding was built during the Afghans' war against Soviet
occupation in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Command reiterated its estimate that the enemy force near
Gardez was made up of "several hundred" fighters. Speaking on condition
of anonymity, one defense official said that the Pentagon believed the
enemy fighters near Gardez were the last major pocket of Al Qaeda
holdouts in Afghanistan. Smaller pockets, he said, probably remain
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The American death was the second during the war attributed to hostile
fire. Wazir Khan said that the U.S. soldier was hit by a mortar shell as
he drove a pickup close to the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Bombing has been going on very heavily," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The area, known as Shahi Kot, has been under surveillance by Americans
since early January, and they approached it several times after reports
that Taliban and Arab fighters were massing there, an Afghan Interior
Ministry official said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters hiding in Shahi Kot are being protected
by several former high-ranking Taliban ministers and commanders,
including Saiful Rahman, Maulvi Mansour and Qabir, the ministry official
said. A key Arab leader in the area is Abu Abdullah, he said, describing
the group as well-armed with shoulder-launched Stinger missiles, mortars
and cannons.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, nor Al
Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was believed to be in the area.</TE>
<TE>   As fighting continued, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 at its
epicenter in the Hindu Kush mountains shook Kabul about 4:40 p.m. local
time Sunday. Concrete buildings swayed, some brick and mud structures
crumbled, and people ran into the streets.</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports about casualties, but at least two
people--an older man and an infant--appear to have been crushed when
brick walls fell on them.</TE>
<TE>   Because Kabul has been ravaged by war, determining which buildings
were damaged by the quake and which were victims of two decades of civil
strife was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   In the old neighborhoods of Kabul, where there are a number of
inhabited--although only half-standing--buildings, brick walls tumbled in
heaps, and concrete walls cracked and fell, crushing small shops beneath
them. Completely demolished, for instance, was a secondhand tin shop
owned by Abdul Aziz, who rushed to the middle of the street when the
earthquake struck because his one-room store was surrounded by already
half-fallen buildings. He left not a moment too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "My shop is gone, completely destroyed now," he said, pointing at the
shop's roof. It had been crushed by a concrete slab falling from a nearby
building.</TE>

<HD>Blunkett Proves His Abilities</HD>
<DH>Britain's home secretary doubts his country is ready for a blind
prime minister, but some speak of him as a successor to Tony Blair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>By conventional wisdom, David Blunkett should not have made it to
the top of British government.</LD>
<LD>   The home secretary is a politician who doesn't suffer fools. He is
unflinchingly blunt in an administration that weighs every word. And
Blunkett, the country's chief law enforcement officer, is blind.</LD>
<LD>   Add to that the fact that his guide dog threw up in the venerable
House of Commons debating chamber--most impolite--and Blunkett should be
back in working-class Sheffield where his early teachers suggested a
career in piano tuning.</LD>
<TE>   Blunkett, however, has never allowed conventional thinking to get in
his way. Despite his hardships, or perhaps because of them, he has risen
to one of the most powerful posts in Britain and is among the most
effective members of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet. Increasingly,
he is mentioned as a potential heir to the Labor Party
leadership--particularly by those who dislike Gordon Brown, the ambitious
chancellor of the exchequer--whenever Blair moves aside.</TE>
<TE>   But could he--would he--do the job at 10 Downing St.? And would
Britain elect a blind prime minister?</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, there isn't a vacancy," Blunkett said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely that Britain would be ready for a blind prime minister
because it takes a long time for people to get used to the idea that
someone with a disability can work at the level I am working at now," he
said. Besides, he added, "I am working at my capacity, and I enjoy the
job I have very much."</TE>
<TE>   Such candor from the 54-year-old Blunkett has not quashed speculation
among the chattering classes. Nor has the fact that the job of top cop
rarely serves as a springboard to the prime minister's office.</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett's high standing is all the more remarkable given the times,
during which he has taken responsibility for such controversial issues as
immigration, law enforcement and the nation's security. He assumed the
Home Office portfolio last summer as Britain's worst race riots in
decades broke out in northern England, and a few months before the Sept.
11 attacks. The events thrust him to the forefront of debates on race,
crime and civil rights almost before he had unpacked.</TE>
<TE>   His responses have confounded critics and allies alike. Blunkett
offended many traditional Labor Party supporters by threatening to use
water cannons against rioters of South Asian ancestry. He insisted that
immigrants should learn English and adopt British ways when coming into
"our home," although most of the rioters were British-born. And he
introduced detention centers for asylum seekers, a move long favored by
the opposition Tories.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he proposed a liberal, green-card-style program to
allow skilled and unskilled workers into Britain to fill labor shortages.
And although he is adamantly opposed to the use of recreational drugs,
Blunkett has in effect decriminalized marijuana to free up police
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "David is interested in what is going to be most effective in terms of
achieving his policy outcome," said former aide Conor Ryan. "He made a
pragmatic decision on cannabis because he is concerned about hard drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett's biggest battle so far has been with human rights activists
and leftist members of his own party over the sweeping anti-terrorism
legislation he pushed through Parliament in December.</TE>
<TE>   The law allows the government to detain, indefinitely and without
trial, foreigners suspected of links to terrorism if they cannot legally
be deported because of the threat of torture or death at home. It also
gives security officials unprecedented access to information from
schools, hospitals, tax authorities, passenger and freight carriers and
Internet providers.</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett's new powers have fueled charges that Britain, already one of
the most closely monitored societies in the West, is becoming ever more
of a Big Brother state.</TE>
<TE>   "He is putting through authoritarian policies which go against many
civil liberties. He overreacted to terrorism attacks with speed and
almost panic," said political science professor Vernon Bogdanor of Oxford
University.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Britain's skeptical public and highly critical media give
Blunkett good reviews. Some people assert that this is a reflection of
his political skill, while others say no one wants to be seen beating up
on a blind man. Still others believe it is because Blunkett is a rare
politician.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't help but like him," said Philip Johnston, home affairs
editor for the conservative Daily Telegraph newspaper, which is usually
hostile to the Blair government. "The hardships he has had to overcome
are quite extraordinary. . . . He is likable, amusing, he's not slick."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Younge, a columnist for the left-of-center Guardian newspaper who
has slammed the home secretary for a "regressive" approach to race
issues, adds that Blunkett has "an emotional intelligence lacking in the
political leadership of all persuasions for some time. Mr. Blunkett does
not have to go off the record to sound like a human being."</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett comes from a part of northern England known for its
plain-spoken ways. Unlike most members of Parliament, he represents an
area where he was born and grew up.</TE>
<TE>   There is a Dickensian quality to Blunkett's early life in industrial
Sheffield, a city in South Yorkshire whose dreariness was made famous by
the 1997 film "The Full Monty." Born blind to loving parents who lived in
one of the country's poorest housing projects, he was sent to boarding
school at age 4 because there were no day schools that could cope with
his disability.</TE>
<TE>   When Blunkett was 12, his foreman father fell into a vat of boiling
water on the job at the East Midlands Gas Board and died an agonizing
month later. The company refused to pay compensation for two years,
driving the family into a poverty that few, if any, British politicians
have known.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing even faintly romantic about being poor and hungry,"
Blunkett wrote in his 1995 autobiography, "On a Clear Day."</TE>
<TE>   But Blunkett has no patience for sentimentalism, least of all about
his own life. When asked about the hardships he has overcome, he pulls a
handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes mock tears from his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   In an era of limited options for the disabled and the working class,
Blunkett went to night school to take college preparation courses and
then attended Sheffield University, where he graduated as a teacher. He
and his wife, Ruth, had three sons before they divorced in 1990. He has
not remarried.</TE>
<TE>   Some Britons speak of Blunkett's success as a kind of American dream,
but he says there are differences.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunities I had, going to university and all those things,
were built on other people having made decisions, changed the world,"
Blunkett said.</TE>
<TE>   "The individualism that's built into the American psyche isn't here
and, therefore, we have to recognize that we have a form of welfare state
which, at its very best, provides the jumping-off point for people to
improve their lives," he said. ". . . At its worst, it cushions people to
the point where they don't feel that necessity to take risks and control
over their own lives. Our task [as a government] is to get that balance
right."</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett won a seat on the Sheffield City Council at 22, took over as
leader of the Council in 1980, and was elected to Parliament in 1987.
When Labor won power 10 years later, he was named secretary of education
and employment. During his four years in the post, he reduced class sizes
and oversaw an improvement in national test scores. He also introduced
performance-related pay for teachers and the country's first university
fees.</TE>
<TE>   When Labor won a second term last year, Blunkett was promoted to home
secretary, where he is taking on police reform and street crime along
with international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   His day begins with briefings from aides, who go over newspapers and
documents with him to find out what he wants committed to tape or
Braille. "What sighted people forget is how much speed reading they do,
moving from one page to another," said Ryan, the former aide.</TE>
<TE>   After a long day of meetings, hearings and sessions of Parliament,
Blunkett takes a dozen or more tapes home in the evening, Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   The home secretary compensates for his lack of sight with other
senses. Blunkett easily recognizes voices and seems able to follow two
conversations at once--even when he is holding one of them. And he has an
uncanny sense of when people have come and gone from a room, however
quietly they may move.</TE>
<TE>   Blunkett stands tall and moves confidently with the assistance of his
dog, Lucy, a black curly-coated retriever mix-breed. When he meets
someone new, he is quick to put the person at ease. He refuses to adapt
his language to his disability, often speaking of having "watched" a
television program or offering to "see you later."</TE>
<TE>   "He hates terms like 'visually impaired,' " Ryan said. "He worries
more about content than terminology."</TE>
<TE>   That's the Yorkshireman in him, constituents said during one of his
weekly trips home to Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   When Blunkett arrived to speak to tenant associations about his war on
street crime, the headline greeting him on the afternoon Star newspaper
was "Police Chief Mugged." Blunkett was unfazed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're no less vulnerable than anyone else. Nobody is exempt," he
said. "There's no point saying national crime statistics show a 12%
overall drop in crime last year if people don't actually experience that
in their own lives and families."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, Blunkett's Cabinet colleague, is generally presumed to be the
one who will take over the party when Blair is ready to step down. The
chancellor of the exchequer has broad support among Labor members of
Parliament and the trade unions.</TE>
<TE>   But Blunkett's rising star became apparent to political reporter Colin
Brown, who is no relation to the chancellor, last summer at the launch of
the home secretary's latest book, "Politics and Progress." The reception
was attended by the in-crowd of "new Labor"--the secretaries of health,
transportation and education, and Blair's wife, human rights lawyer
Cherie Booth.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was there, and they weren't there just for moral support,"
said Brown of London's Independent on Sunday newspaper. "It was easy to
see what was going on. They were saying that David has the support of
Downing Street."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Took Time for This Afghan Raid</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In planning the current air and ground assault in the eastern
Afghan mountains near Gardez, U.S. military strategists drew on the
lessons of last year's disappointing campaign in Tora Bora, a mountainous
region near the Khyber Pass.</LD>
<LD>   That battle began in November and ended after weeks of relentless
airstrikes had killed hundreds of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters. But hundreds--if not thousands--escaped, possibly including
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   This time, defense officials and military analysts say, the Pentagon
is doing it differently.</LD>
<TE>   Before the air assault that began Saturday morning, U.S. soldiers were
deployed to block the roads, making sure that no one left the region.
U.S. diplomats quietly worked with Pakistani officials to ensure that
Afghanistan's border with Pakistan was sealed more thoroughly. Instead of
relying on Afghan forces with sometimes competing interests, war planners
put hundreds more American boots on the ground, taking weeks to train
U.S. and Afghan forces.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, military strategists say, is time. The region had been
under increasingly intense surveillance since early January after reports
of a growing mass of pro-Taliban forces surfaced, an Afghan Interior
Ministry official said.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been in the planning for a few weeks, quite a few weeks," a
senior U.S. defense official said. In Tora Bora, "we didn't know the
terrain very well, and we didn't have quite enough help from the locals.
. . . But here, you had time to set it up, you had time to surveil, you
had time to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   A week before hundreds of American soldiers descended on what Pentagon
officials now describe as the last major redoubt of Al Qaeda fighters,
U.S. officers attending a party in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar
for warlord Gul Agha Shirzai murmured about "the big push up north."</TE>
<TE>   As they walked back to their base, a line of Humvees and equipment
used by special operations soldiers and the Army's 101st Airborne
Division was quietly rolling out to be loaded onto C-17 and C-130 cargo
planes in the dead of night. Thermobaric bombs, devastating
cave-penetrating explosive devices never before tested in battle, were
being shipped from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two months, in fact, special operations soldiers have
been arriving in the villages and mountains of Paktia province and the
city of Khowst, to the southeast. Local Afghan commanders and defense
officials said U.S. Special Forces soldiers trained at least one group of
500 Afghans for a search in the rugged, isolated mountains several hours'
drive south of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign required coordination with special operations and support
soldiers from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and Norway, the
U.S. Central Command, which is running the war, disclosed Sunday. To
achieve that coordination, U.S. commanders took a stronger hand in
managing the campaign still dominated by the 1,500 soldiers of three
Afghan warlords--Kamal Khan Zadran, Zakim Khan and Gen. Zia.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing battle has emerged as the fiercest since December, when a
combination of U.S. air power, Afghan ground forces and U.S. special
operations soldiers defeated the Taliban at its last major stronghold in
Kandahar. A senior defense official described the target region as a
haven for several hundred fighters--discounting estimates of up to
5,000--who have regrouped to form the last major pocket of Al Qaeda and
Taliban holdouts in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were either going to dig in and fight and finish it or
they were going to scatter and run. So we had to prepare the size of
force--the weaponeering, the tactics--to account for either," the defense
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we've been down in the area," he added. "We've established some
relationships with locals. We've learned the terrain very well. We have a
better picture of how they move about."</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials have declined to describe the Tora Bora campaign as
rife with mistakes but have acknowledged that U.S. forces did not
understand the porous terrain. The Afghan soldiers who dominated the
anti-Taliban forces in the campaign often led cave-by-cave searches
reluctantly, appearing more interested in looting than finding Bin Laden,
one analyst said. Although the Gardez-area campaign reverted largely to
an air campaign on Sunday--the result, Afghan commanders said, of intense
opposition from well-armed pro-Taliban fighters--there are hundreds more
Americans on the battleground, including both Special Forces and, for the
first time, regular Army soldiers from the 101st Airborne, based in
Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "The Defense Department has done a remarkably good job of learning on
the fly," Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a retired Army intelligence officer,
said Sunday. "In Tora Bora, there were high hopes that the Afghans would
in fact do more for us than they actually did, which is why you're now
seeing more U.S. forces on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has also dug deeper into its arsenal to ship 2,000-pound
thermobaric explosives to Afghanistan. The bombs, used at least twice
over the weekend, send the explosive pressure of the bomb deep into cave
and tunnel complexes.</TE>
<TE>   Another failing in Tora Bora came in coordinating with Pakistan,
analysts said. The United States relied almost exclusively on Pakistani
soldiers to seal the border, by some accounts allowing thousands of
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to cross to safety in Pakistan after doing
little more than removing their trademark black turbans. Some reports
suggested that Pakistani intelligence officials loyal to the Taliban
aided the fugitives. This time, U.S. soldiers have reportedly blocked all
roads out of the region and coordinated much more closely with Pakistan
to guard the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We relied on the Pakistanis to do that at Tora Bora, and that was a
mistake. They didn't do it," said Col. Timothy Eads, a retired Army
special operations officer. "From what I understand, U.S. forces sealed
the border this time."</TE>
<TE>   Notably, the suspected pro-Taliban forces are believed not to have
fled before the current attack, suggesting that Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf may have purged from his intelligence service the
pro-Taliban elements who might have tipped off the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly hit them before they could move all their key people and
supplies out of the area," Peters said.</TE>

<HD>Swiss Vote to Join U.N.</HD>
<DH>Referendum: Neutral nation splits along social, geographical lines
but narrowly elects to become 190th member.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>The Swiss voted Sunday to join the United Nations, moving their
country warily but decisively closer to the international community after
centuries of neutrality and independence.</LD>
<LD>   The vote Sunday will make Switzerland the U.N.'s 190th member, leaving
the Vatican as the only nonmember state with observer status.</LD>
<LD>   The referendum to change the Swiss Constitution to allow U.N. entry
won 56.4% of the ballots and carried 12 of 23 cantons, the Swiss
equivalent of states--a close result that displayed the divisions created
by the proposal in the Alpine nation of 7 million people. Approval
required majorities of both the popular vote and the cantons.</LD>
<TE>   Relieved Swiss leaders said the voters had put an end to an
increasingly uncomfortable and paradoxical isolationism: Despite decades
of resistance to joining the United Nations, Switzerland is home of the
organization's European headquarters, contributes to the U.N. budget and
belongs to U.N. agencies such as the World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I have communicated the intention of our country to join the United
Nations by telephone to the organization's secretary-general," said Swiss
Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss at a news conference in the capital, Bern,
on Sunday. He added: "Switzerland remains a sovereign country, a neutral
country and a strong country."</TE>
<TE>   The election was not exactly an overwhelming embrace of the United
Nations, though it showed that Switzerland has changed considerably
during the last decade and a half. In 1986, 75% of voters rejected a
similar proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's vote and the campaign preceding it reflected continuing
anti-U.N. sentiment that is prevalent in regions that are rural, eastern
and German- and Italian-speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Rightist and nationalist parties led by Christoph Blocher, a Zurich
billionaire, warned voters during the campaign that their prosperous
society would endanger its cherished commitment to neutrality by
surrendering to the supposedly dangerous whims of the United States and
other powers that dominate the U.N. Security Council. In recent weeks,
the "No" campaign featured slogans such as "Yes to the Red Cross and
Peace, No to the U.N. and War."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to join the U.N. "will unfortunately lead to a weakening
of Switzerland," Blocher said Sunday night after the results became
clear. "It will have financial consequences for citizens. The freedoms of
Swiss will be limited, and neutrality will be massively weakened.
Unfortunately, it will have economic consequences as well, because
foreign confidence in Switzerland will fall."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the financial establishment, the church, labor unions and
other influential blocs had lobbied hard for the referendum. It was part
of a larger trend--exemplified by a law enforcement crackdown on money
laundering by foreign criminals in Swiss banks during the last
decade--toward tempering traditional aloofness and promoting
Switzerland's role as a good global citizen. Switzerland's image has
suffered as a result of steadily isolationist votes rejecting proposals
in recent years to join the European Union, U.N. peacekeeping forces and
other international entities, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the referendum argued that the longtime rationale for
Swiss abstention from membership faded after the end of the Cold War
muted fears that Switzerland would have to take sides in an arena defined
by conflict between East and West.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Swiss leaders argued that the symbolism of participating as
an unabashed member of the world community would bring tangible results.</TE>
<TE>   "We will finally have the possibility of participating in the making
of decisions and of defending directly our interests instead of depending
on the goodwill of others," said Jeno Staehelin, a diplomat.</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe Candidates Come Out Swinging</HD>
<DH>Election: Presidential front-runners focus more on each other than
the issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>To hear the two presidential front-runners here tell it, incumbent
Robert Mugabe is a senile old man who has overstayed his welcome at
Zimbabwe's helm, while opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, his main
challenger, is a lackey of the British government--an Uncle Tom.</LD>
<LD>   Reports from Zimbabwe in recent weeks have emphasized the Mugabe
government's efforts to obstruct the opposition by means of both
questionable legislation and intimidation. But in the countdown to next
weekend's election, these rivals have come out swinging like
old-fashioned pols, determined to win votes through fierce rhetoric and
often vicious advertising campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front Party,
or ZANU-PF, face their toughest challenge in 22 years in power from
Tsvangirai, a former trade unionist and leader of the Movement for
Democratic Change, or MDC.</LD>
<TE>   Although issues such as the country's collapsing economy, land reform
and food shortages have emerged as serious concerns for average
Zimbabweans, a barrage of mudslinging and character assassination has
increasingly dominated the campaign on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said this weekend that the vast majority of Zimbabweans
have already made their choice.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be name-calling, but people are aware of what [Mugabe and
Tsvangirai] stand for essentially," said Masipula Sithole, a political
science professor and director of the Mass Public Opinion Institute, a
polling organization. "People are taking notice. They are reading between
the lines. They know the tactics."</TE>
<TE>   Rallies held Sunday in this sweltering capital marked the beginning of
a last-ditch attempt by the candidates to win new support in the final
lap before the March 9-10 polls.</TE>
<TE>   In separate parts of town, buoyant crowds gathered to hear Mugabe slam
his opponent as a stooge of Britain, from which Zimbabwe won independence
in 1980, and Tsvangirai blame the president for rampant government
corruption, unemployment and widespread hunger.</TE>
<TE>   But the war of words began weeks ago in Zimbabwe's highly polarized
media. Mugabe has used the state newspaper and the government-sponsored
television and radio stations, which have tentacles across the country,
as his mouthpieces. Tsvangirai depends on the often harassed independent
press, which is not accessible nationwide, to get his message across.</TE>
<TE>   For Mugabe, the contest pits a nationalist champion of black interests
against a puppet not only of Britain, but also of the white farmers who
retain most of the country's prime farmland.</TE>
<TE>   Touting his credentials as a hero of the liberation war, Mugabe has
often referred to Tsvangirai as being a "shameless traitor and sellout"
sponsored by the British government to defend the interests of Zimbabwe's
white minority at the expense of Zimbabwe's black majority.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose your independence today to whites, how long will it take
for us to set things right?" Mugabe told a rally in the southwestern town
of Gwanda on Friday. "It took us over a hundred years before."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to deflect criticism from the country's collapsing
economy and biting food shortages, the ruling party advertisements accuse
white farmers of hoarding and burning sacks of maize--the main staple for
most black Zimbabweans.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoarding food is criminal," one ad reads. "Don't reward food hoarding
by voting for those behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the government also charged Tsvangirai with treason for
allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. It said it had a videotape on
which the opposition leader could be heard talking about the president
being "eliminated." The MDC and Western powers have dismissed the treason
charges, which carry the death penalty, as a ploy to discredit
Tsvangirai.</TE>
<TE>   The MDC, meanwhile, has couched its more serious campaign messages
within attacks on Mugabe and ruling party stalwarts.</TE>
<TE>   The 78-year-old president is portrayed as being too old and senile to
run the country. One ad says, "The only thing as high as Zimbabwe's
inflation is Mugabe's age." Tsvangirai is 49.</TE>
<TE>   Inflation here has soared to an annual rate of 117%, pushing many
basic commodities out of reach of ordinary Zimbabweans. Three-quarters of
the population lives below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   Nkanyiso Maqeda, the MDC's information and publicity coordinator,
acknowledges that surveys commissioned by the party showed that ads
criticizing Mugabe's age were unpopular with many voters.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us to stick to the main issues that concern them, like
jobs, food shortages, AIDS, the rule of law, peace and education," Maqeda
said.</TE>
<TE>   So in recent weeks, the MDC has changed its strategy, focusing more on
economic issues, employment and the preponderance of violence against its
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Moyse, project coordinator for the independent Media Monitoring
Project, which reviews the domestic media for balance and bias, said that
such advertisements seemed likely to hit home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they do have an impact," he said. "Largely people are
convinced by what they experience. I think it's much less tangible [to
imagine] Britain recolonizing Zimbabwe than a shortage in the staple
diet. And those people who have experienced violence will know where [the
MDC] is coming from."</TE>
<TE>   But ZANU-PF's control of television and radio appears to have given
the ruling party the upper hand when it comes to disseminating its
message, local observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics gathered by the Media Monitoring Project for the third week
of February showed that of the 49 campaign-related stories aired by
Zimbabwean state television, 39 favored the ruling party. Five stories,
all of which were negative in tone, focused on the MDC, Moyse said, while
the remainder were about the little-known National Alliance for Good
Governance. The 49 stories lasted a total of 88 minutes, 78 of which
focused on ZANU-PF.</TE>
<TE>   A local opinion poll published in mid-February showed Tsvangirai in

<DL>KADI, India
</DL>
<LD>People know their neighbors well in a small town, and with about 50
copies of the Koran reduced to ashes in the mosque here, Muslims have a
good idea who committed the sacrilege.</LD>
<LD>   Khadim Kasam Babu, who protects the tomb of a Muslim saint just
outside Kadi, says Ramesh Patel, a Hindu town councilor, was the leader
of a mob that desecrated that site in a separate attack Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Abbas Pathan, a criminal lawyer and a Muslim community leader, blames
Patel and other supporters of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad party
for a string of arson incidents in western India since mob violence
erupted last week.</LD>
<TE>   Patel and the party deny they had anything to do with any of these
attacks. But Girish Patel, a Harvard law graduate and one of India's
leading human rights lawyers, has no doubt that the VHP orchestrated
murderous violence across Gujarat state--with the complicity of
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "From various sources, I know there were instructions not to take any
action," lawyer Patel said in an interview Sunday in Ahmadabad, the
state's commercial capital. "If you go to any place where people were
killed, or properties were looted, the police were nearby and no action
was taken."</TE>
<TE>   Patel, himself a Hindu and a practicing attorney and law professor for
about 40 years, has taken refuge in a friend's home after receiving
repeated threats for speaking out against the unrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I receive threats every other day," he said. "They say, 'You are a
Muslim.' Many people tell me, 'Why don't you go to Pakistan?' I might,
but I would end up in jail because I would still defend the common
people."</TE>
<TE>   Gujarat's government claimed Sunday that police and army troops had
brought the violence under control, although there were reports of
sporadic incidents. Even as India's hard-line home affairs minister, Lal
Krishna Advani, visited Ahmadabad to show the federal government's
resolve, arsonists set fire to a mosque in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Rampaging mobs have killed more than 500 people since Wednesday, when
Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindu nationalists. That attack
killed 58 people, 14 of them children, and sparked India's worst communal
violence in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors have said a mob of more than 1,000 Muslims carried out an
organized, unprovoked assault soon after the express train left the
station in the city of Godhra.</TE>
<TE>Conflicting Reports on Train Attack's Origin</TE>
<TE>   But several reports quoting witnesses have said the Hindu activists
stirred up trouble by chanting offensive slogans and refusing to pay for
food bought from Muslim women.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after the Godhra massacre, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said, based on preliminary reports, that "it appears that
the train was stopped, maybe because slogans were being shouted in the
train."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the train fire's victims were VHP supporters returning from
the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, where the party is threatening to
defy a court order and start building a Hindu temple.</TE>
<TE>   They want to construct it on the site of the historic Babri Masjid
mosque, which Hindu extremists demolished in December 1992, setting off a
wave of communal riots across India that killed between 2,000 and 3,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   Narendra Modi, chief minister of Gujarat state, belongs to Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party but also has ties to the Hindu extremist group
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. That party has frequently been accused of
fomenting communal violence since its founding in 1925.</TE>
<TE>   Kadi, a town about 25 miles northwest of Ahmadabad, escaped the brunt
of last week's unrest. Hindu vigilantes at a roadblock outside town set
two Muslim truck drivers on fire, but they survived the attack, said
Pathan, the Muslim community leader. Looters also struck every
Muslim-owned shop, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the town's streets were deserted Sunday, and the minority
Muslim community still frightened, the worst appeared to be over. When
the violence peaked in Kadi on Friday, a Hindu mob set fire to another
Muslim saint's tomb, destroying a site that had survived untouched for
roughly two centuries, Pathan said.</TE>
<TE>   Pathan accused Babu Bhai Kachwala, the VHP's local leader, of driving
around town and nearby villages in a party vehicle, rallying Hindus
against Muslims through a loudspeaker mounted on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen him do it every day," Pathan said. "He says things like:
'In Hindustan [India], if Hindus and Muslims are supposed to live
together, then they must all be our followers.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kachwala denied doing anything but provide free medical help to the
poor, Hindus and Muslims alike, in his party jeep.</TE>
<TE>   "We only serve," said Kachwala, who also denied having anything to do
with attacks on Muslims or their holy sites.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it happens that they burn their mosques themselves and they
blame it on others," said Vishnu Bhai Patel, a VHP party member sitting
at his leader's side.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ramesh Patel, the town councilor, rejected the
accusation that he led a mob of about 800 Hindus in the first of three
attacks last week on the Muslim saint's tomb outside town. Patel wasn't
at home Sunday afternoon, but after returning about 9 p.m., he insisted
that he had been a force for peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go anywhere at all," he said in a telephone interview. "I
just stay in my area trying to keep everyone quiet. I do not provoke
anyone."</TE>
<TE>Ashes of Koran Lie on Imam's Seat</TE>
<TE>   Kadi's small 19th century Bhagdalwad mosque was destroyed during
anti-Muslim riots in 1969 and was rebuilt. Now, the inside walls have
been scorched by the flames of burning prayer mats and copies of the
Koran.</TE>
<TE>   The ashes from several of the burned holy books were lying Sunday on
the marble minbar, the stepped seat where the imam leads prayers every
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In Ahmadabad, looting and arson attacks on Muslims were so systematic
last week that they must have been organized, said Patel, the human
rights lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "They carefully selected Muslims' property and destroyed it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among evidence of that, Patel said, was the fact that arsonists and
looters somehow knew that such buildings as a local hotel, part of a U.S.
chain, and a single shop in an upscale mall were owned by Muslims. He
doubted that spontaneous attacks would have been so precisely targeted.</TE>
<TE>   An old Muslim friend of Patel's, he said, called him in a panic just
after midnight Wednesday, the worst day of rioting in Ahmadabad, to ask
for help because a Hindu crowd was besieging his home.</TE>
<TE>   Patel said he made several phone calls, desperately trying to persuade
the police to rescue his friend and his family, and after getting
nowhere, phoned Police Commissioner P. C. Pande.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good man, one of the rare ones you find without corruption,"
the lawyer said. "He said, 'I'm helpless because the police are highly
communalized.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, a single police officer fired tear gas to disperse the mob
outside the home of Patel's friend, the lawyer said. The crowd regrouped
but didn't kill the man, who escaped the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Ahsan Jaffrey, a former member of Parliament, wasn't so fortunate. He
died that night with 19 relatives in the flames of his own house. He had
tried to chase the crowd off by firing his rifle into the air.</TE>

<HD>7 Members of an Israeli Family Are Buried After Weekend Attacks</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Prime Minister Ariel Sharon huddles with advisors in the
wake of Palestinian assaults that killed 21.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RISHON LE ZION, Israel
</DL>
<LD>Anguished mourners buried seven members of the Nehmad family here
Sunday, including three children, as the government of Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon launched retaliatory airstrikes for a string of attacks that
killed 21 Israelis over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "The man who did this is not a human being. He is an animal," Rishon
Mayor Meir Nitzan cried out in a eulogy delivered before 3,000 people at
the town's cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, F-16 fighter jets and helicopters carried out limited
airstrikes against Palestinian targets, killing four Palestinians in
attacks on police stations, a military intelligence building and a
checkpoint in the West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Early this morning, Israeli troops killed three Palestinians in Rafah,
a Gaza Strip refugee camp on the border with Egypt. Palestinians said
troops shot the Palestinians in clashes that erupted when tanks and
troops entered the camp and demolished three houses. An army spokesman
said one abandoned home was bulldozed as troops searched for cross-border
tunnels, and troops fired when they came under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said one of two police stations hit in Ramallah was
several hundred yards from the headquarters of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. He was not hurt, but a Palestinian policeman was
killed. An Israeli army spokesman denied that there were airstrikes in
Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, under mounting pressure from both left and right to
drastically alter his approach to the conflict, huddled with groups of
ministers and security chiefs throughout the day. But he resisted the
demands of right-wing ministers in his Cabinet that the Palestinian
Authority be toppled and Arafat driven from Palestinian-controlled
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Late Sunday, the Israeli security Cabinet--Sharon and senior
ministers--issued a statement saying it had approved a plan for action.</TE>
<TE>   Israel will put "continuous military pressure on the Palestinian
Authority and the terrorist organizations which aim to put the brakes on
Palestinian terror," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Sources in the prime minister's office said earlier Sunday that the
government would step up its military operations but would not destroy
the authority or harm Arafat. State-run Israel Radio quoted Sharon as
telling his Cabinet that Israel faces a long fight with the Palestinians
and that only military pressure will eventually force them back to the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Since his election a year ago, Sharon has insisted that he will
conduct political negotiations with the Palestinians only if they halt
all attacks on Israelis. As the toll of dead Israelis rises, however,
opinion polls show his popularity sagging.</TE>
<TE>   Although the public is demanding either a military or a political
solution to the conflict, the partnership Sharon has forged with the
center-left Labor Party makes it hard for him to deal a crushing blow to
the Palestinian Authority. But his dependence on the right-wing parties
that are the core of his government makes it difficult for him to seek a
negotiated settlement while the violence continues.</TE>
<TE>   For Israelis exhausted by more than 17 months of bloodshed, Sunday was
another day of horror.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies of the nine Israelis killed Saturday night in a suicide bombing
in an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood had not even been identified
by forensic specialists, when a Palestinian gunman launched another
devastating attack as Israelis began their workweek Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman climbed a hill above a remote Israeli army checkpoint in
the West Bank, then used a rifle to methodically gun down soldiers
manning the roadblock, Jewish settlers waiting to pass through in their
cars on their way to work and rescuers who arrived at the scene. Army
investigators said he shot 30 times, killing the three soldiers at the
checkpoint. An aged carbine he was thought to have used was found at the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   A commander who emerged from a structure at the checkpoint when the
shooting started was also gunned down, as was a fourth soldier. The
gunman then targeted the commuters, strafing their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Before the shooting ended, two more soldiers and three Jewish settlers
were either dead or mortally wounded. Six others were wounded, including
the civilian chief of security for settlements in the region. The gunman
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, an Israeli police officer was shot dead in the West Bank.
In another incident in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, a soldier was shot
dead outside a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Israeli
checkpoint, the third such assault in recent weeks. The same militia
claimed responsibility for Saturday night's suicide bombing and for the
policeman's death.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, Israel's invasion last week of the Balata refugee camp
in the West Bank city of Nablus and of another camp in Jenin, also in the
West Bank, was cited as the reason for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell that dog Sharon that I will strike and I will avenge my
families in the Balata refugee camp . . . [and] Jenin refugee camp, and
on behalf of all the martyrs in Palestine," said suicide bomber Mohammed
Daraghma, 18, in a statement videotaped before he blew himself to bits in
Jerusalem on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops thrust deep into the camps, killing more than 20
Palestinians, some of them civilians, before withdrawing. The army said
the incursions were meant to demonstrate that Israel will not hesitate to
pursue gunmen wherever they may be, even at the risk of Palestinian
civilian and Israeli military casualties.</TE>
<TE>   But military analysts here have harshly criticized the invasions as
unnecessarily risky and provocative, and some Israeli commentators Sunday
also linked those operations to the new surge of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The operation in Balata and Jenin did not cause the suicide bombing
attack last night in Jerusalem," said commentator Oded Granot in the
Maariv newspaper, "but it did silence the Palestinian voices who called
for the terror attacks to be curbed and restricted to settlers and army
roadblocks only."</TE>
<TE>   And Nahum Barnea, a respected political analyst, wrote in Yediot
Aharonot that "something, someone has to break this cycle of violence."</TE>
<TE>   After more than 17 months of fighting "we know that salvation does not
lie with the army," Barnea wrote. "The terrorism of suicide bombings was
born of despair, and there is no military solution to despair. But
salvation does not lie with Arafat either. The war has slipped out of his
control and has turned into a war of one people against another."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the soldiers killed at the roadblock were also from Rishon,
Israel's fourth-largest city. Located just south of Tel Aviv, the
bustling and prosperous community had escaped unscathed from the months
of carnage. There had been no suicide bombings here, no gunmen stalking
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who poured into the cemetery Sunday afternoon to bury Gafnit
and Shlomi Nehmad and their two daughters, Shiraz, 7, and Liran, 3, were
shocked into a grim-faced silence as they watched remaining family
members fall apart during the eulogies.</TE>
<TE>   The Nehmads were killed as they stood outside a bar mitzvah they had
attended in Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Beit Israel neighborhood Saturday
night. They died along with Shlomi Nehmad's 15-year-old nephew, Shaul
Nehmad, and Gafnit Nehmad's 11-year-old nephew, Lidor, and the boy's
18-month-old sister, Oriya. All seven were buried in the Rishon cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Sobs racking his body, Shimon Ilan, the father of Lidor and Oriya and
brother of Gafnit Nehmad, told the mourners that he was standing near his
car, Oriya in his arms and his 8-year-old daughter Noa beside him, when
the blast occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything went flying in the air. I wanted to look for my baby. My
daughter lifted her, screaming, 'Oriya is dead! Oriya is dead!' " Ilan
said. "I looked for my son, 11 years old. I am crazy about him. I saw him
lying on the road, full of blood. I screamed and said: 'God! Why?' "</TE>
<TE>   Ilan clutched the pillow his son slept on as he spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot separate from him," he said. "This is his pillow, which will
be with me for as long as I live."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a reporter before leaving for the funeral, Mayor Nitzan
said he was fed up with the government. It needs to take much stronger
military steps, he said, and at the same time immediately open
negotiations with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not had a day like this in Rishon since we were bombed by the
Egyptians in the 1948 War of Independence," Nitzan said. "These people
were killed because they were Jews. They were killed coming out from
prayers. To kill people who have been praying is paganism. It is not
Islam to kill people as they come from their prayers."</TE>
<TE>   The government's response, Nitzan said, must be fundamentally
different from what it has been.</TE>
<TE>   "The bombers must know that we will destroy the home of their
families," he said. "And if there is a mosque that taught the bomber to
do this thing, or a religious school that preached to do it, they are
places of paganism and must be destroyed."</TE>

<LD>Syrian President Bashar Assad made an official trip to Lebanon, the
first such visit in 27 years despite Syria's strong influence over its
smaller neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   Assad met with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud to discuss an Arab
summit scheduled in Beirut this month. The two said a settlement of the
Mideast conflict must include a full Israeli withdrawal from occupied
Arab territories and the return of Palestinian refugees.</LD>
<LD>   Lebanese criticism of Syria's dominance has grown since Israel
withdrew its troops in May 2000. But Lebanon's government has said the
Syrian presence is needed for stability as the country recovers from its
1975-90 civil war.</LD>

<DH>Afghanistan: Mourners come from miles to pay homage at cemetery
where members of terror group were buried after deadly U.S. airstrike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KHOWST, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Even in a driving rain, the worshipers stream to a roadside
graveyard here.</LD>
<LD>   They show their veneration by tying brightly colored banners onto
pieces of string stretched between the burial mounds. Hundreds of these
flags blow in the wind--rare spots of color in a desolate winter
landscape.</LD>
<LD>   But in this case, devotion carries a complicated and disturbing
message for Americans. This is no ordinary graveyard.</LD>
<TE>   Here and in a nearby, and even better-kept, burial ground lie the
remains of 100 to 150 Al Qaeda members and Taliban leaders who died when
U.S. bombers blasted the mosque where they were saying their evening
prayers last fall on the second night of Ramadan, the most holy of Muslim
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   The graveyards' popularity--local people call them "the shrine" and
those buried there "martyrs"--is a chilling reminder of the persistence
of Al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan and of the depth of the movement's
local support. It also suggests how difficult it will be for the U.S. to
eradicate the group, because with each Al Qaeda member killed, sympathy
for the movement's anti-American rhetoric builds.</TE>
<TE>'Just About the Last Al Qaeda Stronghold'</TE>
<TE>   "They were Muslims, and they were killed in a holy place, in a mosque.
Even if they were Al Qaeda, it was wrong to kill them like that. We do
not have 'Al Qaeda' in Islam, we only have Muslims," said Youssef Rahman,
20, who came along with three friends to pray at the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   This is Al Qaeda country. Near here, American and Afghan government
troops have joined forces for the largest joint ground offensive of the
war. They are now heavily engaged in an effort to rout hundreds of Al
Qaeda members from a mountain and cave complex in central Paktia
province.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence suggests that Paktia is the last place in
Afghanistan where Al Qaeda is still active. Signs of its presence are
everywhere, and the tucked-away pockets of Arabs--as the Al Qaeda
fighters are widely known--have been an open secret among local
residents.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital in Khowst, doctors say they last saw Arab patients in
late December, when a dozen or so came for treatment of shrapnel wounds
after a U.S. bombing attack on the village where they were living.</TE>
<TE>   Before mid-November, when the Taliban regime abandoned the Afghan
capital, Kabul, Arabs came to Khowst regularly for medical treatment.
Their wives delivered their babies in the hospital's maternity ward, and
the facility even had two Pakistani nursing assistants who could speak
some Arabic, said Hamidullah, 36, the chief nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Just a short way away is a house right in the middle of Khowst where
Arabs lived, said Surgul, the chief of security for the city and a local
commander. The compound, which the Arabs evacuated in November, looks
like most walled Afghan homes except for the fragments of paper and the
fliers left behind, all in Arabic. One document found by Surgul was a
fatwa, or religious edict, against Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In one locked room, it is possible to glimpse boxes filled with large
bottles of chemicals. U.S. forces came and photographed everything in the
room but left it intact, Surgul said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just about the last Al Qaeda stronghold," said a U.S. Special
Forces soldier in Paktia province who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The hard thing here is that it's difficult to sort out who is Al Qaeda
and who isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Americans first took aim at the region in 1998, when the U.S. shot a
cruise missile at Zhawar Kili, a village high in the mountains just a
couple of miles from the Pakistani border that Osama bin Laden had used
as a major base.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 Arabs lived there at one time, hiding weapons in
well-fortified caves, training soldiers on the rugged terrain and going
to a school whose fervent motto can still be made out: "We will continue
our jihad until the end of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Arabs fled after that attack, some of them, along with
their Taliban supporters, appear to have returned subsequently and used
the caves for storing weapons. Many continue to cross into Pakistan,
where they are suspected of receiving support from renegade members of
the Pakistani intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. bombed the area heavily in January. But Zhawar Kili is just
one of a score of villages and compounds in eastern Afghanistan that the
Americans destroyed because they suspected that Al Qaeda and Taliban
members were hiding there.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out where Al Qaeda and Taliban loyalists take refuge is like
searching for shadows. Local intelligence is a mixed bag, replete with
disinformation and false leads. One former Taliban deputy minister of
telecommunications, Maulani Monib, distanced himself from the Taliban and
then apparently began to work clandestinely with the Americans at the
same time that he was still working with Al Qaeda. He was found out last
month and disappeared over the border into Pakistan, according to a
high-ranking official in the Afghan Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>A $5,000 Bounty on American Soldiers</TE>
<TE>   Some local commanders and soldiers play both sides because they still
have ties to Taliban leaders. Some of the latter were heroes of the
Afghans' fight against the Soviets, and no one wants to betray them.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters is that it is dangerous for Americans to
operate in Paktia.</TE>
<TE>   There is a $5,000 bounty for killing an American and the promise of
$300,000 for the assailant's family if he is martyred in the process,
according to Special Forces troops.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is for any American, but particularly a soldier," one U.S.
fighter said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps then it is not surprising that before a U.S. service member
was killed this weekend, the only soldier killed in Afghanistan by
hostile fire was slain in Khowst. On Jan. 4, Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Ross
Chapman was shot as he stood in the back of a pickup truck surveying the
damage that U.S. bombing had done to the mosque and looking at the
graveyard nearby, according to locals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dangerous place for Americans because the threat isn't an
all-out assault. What you worry about is the low-level guy who hates you
or just wants to make some money," the U.S. fighter said.</TE>
<TE>   But no amount of money offered by an American, it seems, would be
likely to win over the worshipers at the Al Qaeda shrines in Khowst. They
are rich and poor, young and old. There are too many of them even for the
commanders of the city, who are closely allied with the Americans, to
stop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better for the Americans to leave our country and go back to
their own country--and not only here. They should leave all the Muslim
countries," said Barat Khan, 18, a soldier in the new Afghan government
who had come to worship at the shrine dedicated exclusively to Arab dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans are cruel. They kill 20 Afghans for one Al Qaeda
member," Barat said as he fingered a set of prayer beads. "Yes, of course
they have enemies."</TE>

<DL>SURMAD, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Thousands of white strips of paper lay scattered across the brown
plains of Afghanistan's eastern Paktia province Sunday, messages and
warnings from the U.S.-led military coalition:</LD>
<LD>   "Hand over Taliban and Al Qaeda or you will be destroyed. Come forward
with information about Taliban and Al Qaeda."</LD>
<LD>   The pamphlets littered plains leading to mountains where U.S. jets are
attacking Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, pounding the cave complexes that
honeycomb the snowy peaks.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. aircraft dropped thousands of the leaflets overnight. Children
ran through a rock-strewn field to collect them. They pushed and shoved
each other to get at them, giggled and read what was written in
Afghanistan's two most common languages, Pashto and Dari.</TE>
<TE>   Each paper had a message for the people of the area. "Give any
information you have about Al Qaeda or Taliban to the coalition forces,"
one leaflet urged.</TE>
<TE>   Pashto is the language of the country's largest ethnic group, the
Pushtun. They dominate Paktia province, where it is believed that members
of the Taliban--who are largely Pushtun--and Al Qaeda are regrouping with
the distant help of leaders thought to have escaped to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda and Taliban members in the mountains also are believed to
be receiving assistance from Pakistani militants and rogue elements of
Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency.</TE>

<LD>   Non-motorized scooters have soared in popularity--with an accompanying

<HD>Taboos Fade as Sept. 11 Recedes Into Past</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Late-night jokes and criticism of victims' families show
Americans are getting past their grief and on with their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In a cavernous room here a few weeks ago, 800 relatives of the
Sept. 11 dead were shocked into silence when one of their leaders bluntly
told them that some Americans consider them "a greedy pack of wolves" for
criticizing proposed rules for a federal victims' compensation fund.</LD>
<LD>   A widow from Long Island with two young children clasped her hands and
shook them in the air as Anthony Gardner, chairman of the World Trade
Center United Family Group, continued speaking. "They don't understand
us," she said to no one in particular. "They don't know what we're
facing, a future with children and not enough income, nothing to keep us
going."</LD>
<LD>   While it would have been unthinkable to criticize the bereaved in the
days after Sept. 11, the sense of reverence surrounding the event is
beginning to fall away for many.</LD>
<TE>   Although there remains a great reservoir of emotion around the event
and goodwill toward those affected, there are also signs that some people
are becoming fatigued by references to Sept. 11. Humorists are back to
satirizing the president and plumbing the worst attack in U.S. history
for good jokes. The many Sept. 11 tributes--from the Super Bowl halftime
show to the Olympics opening ceremony--are starting to wear on some.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I would have felt this way in the fall, but I'm a little
tired of these tributes, and do they have to be a part of everything we
do?" said Ilana Smith, a Tenafly, N.J., housewife who had a living room
full of Super Bowl watchers. Many of them groaned during the human
reenactment of the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima. "That," Smith added,
"was over the top."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent column in Salon, an Internet publication, Daniel Harris
complained about the "kitschification" of 9/11. The ribbons,
commemorative quilts, flag refrigerator magnets and inspirational songs,
he said, serve to silence "dissenting opinions."</TE>
<TE>   But while flag stickers are not exactly being peeled off car windows
in Atlanta, Kara Cummings, an architect there, said she and her friends
are not as focused on patriotism and Sept. 11 as they were just weeks
ago. Rather, they've fallen back into ordinary life, going to malls and
the movies again after a few months' retreat.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew people who worried about getting stuck in the dark with too
many people they didn't know, so they avoided the movies," Cummings said.
"Now they're back."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, terrorism and the war in Afghanistan remain burning issues.
But now the day's water cooler chatter is as much about Enron Corp., the
economy and more personal concerns.</TE>
<TE>Culture Sped Recovery</TE>
<TE>   Considering the hand wringing, paranoia and collective grief of six
months ago, this return to normality has happened remarkably fast,
experts say. The speed of modern life and the absence of further attacks
have allowed many Americans to move on faster than many first might have
believed.</TE>
<TE>   Even most New Yorkers have eased back into life, riding subways they
once fretted about and returning to office towers they had feared as
targets. Only days after he was sworn in, the city's new mayor, Michael
R. Bloomberg, rejected Rudolph W. Giuliani's vision for a Sept. 11
memorial--and he caught surprisingly little flak for opposing his
lionized predecessor on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our culture of fast and faster which tends to wipe out every
product, every celebrity, every traumatization to make room for the new
product, the new celebrity and new trauma," said Marshall Blonsky, a
professor of semiotics--the study of signs and symbols of culture--at the
New School for Social Research here.</TE>
<TE>   No one, Blonsky says, should expect New York police officers and
firefighters to continue in their mythic roles. New York just could not
be America's teddy bear for very long.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're celebrating today . . . we'll forget tomorrow," the
professor said. "That is what it means to be a culture of consumption,
speed and surface."</TE>
<TE>   Venom against the victims' families six months ago would have been
unfathomable. But early sympathy has given way to public criticism
reflected in about 8,000 comments posted on the Web site of the
Department of Justice and in e-mails to the various family groups.</TE>
<TE>   "What a bunch of crybabies," griped an anonymous posting on the
Justice Department Web site. "The U.S. government should never have
agreed to compensation for them." "The U.S. taxpayers don't owe the
victims' families anything," was another comment. "We did not kill their
loved ones. . . . They should have had insurance."</TE>
<TE>   The federal victims' fund was set up by Congress 10 days after the
attack to compensate relatives for economic loss and emotional suffering,
as long as they agreed to waive their right to sue. Some families said
the fund's rules were unfair and would leave many with nothing. They came
together in groups to force change and now await a final ruling by a
special master on how the money will be disbursed.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the solidarity among the families has begun to erode.
One group leader quietly attributed the backlash against the families to
the personality of another group leader who appears frequently on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "But don't quote me," he said, quickly. "In fact, never quote me again
on the compensation fund. The complexity of it created a lot of
controversy. Different family members had different objections, and I've
had enough."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are some lines that have not been crossed, some taboos
that have not slipped away. Politicians, for example, criticize the
events of Sept. 11 at their own peril.</TE>
<TE>   White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. had to apologize
last month for saying that New York lawmakers' efforts to get federal
money for Sept. 11-related costs were like "a little money-grubbing
game."</TE>
<TE>Humor Salved Wounds</TE>
<TE>   If some Americans are weary of flag-waving and the latest terrorist
alert from Washington, the events are still present in their lives. For
the sum of what went on was incomprehensible--the fiery attacks on
landmarks, the anthrax scares that crippled the U.S. Postal Service, the
war, the billions of dollars spent to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   With life that out of proportion, one way Americans sought to
understand it was to find a way to laugh about it.</TE>
<TE>   Political humor on the late-night TV shows is up 38% over pre-Sept. 11
averages after dropping by half immediately following the attacks,
according to a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which
monitored "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno," "Late Show With David
Letterman" and "Late Night With Conan O'Brien."</TE>
<TE>   Shows such as "South Park" and the late-night comics quickly made fun
of a Dec. 13 videotape of Osama bin Laden talking about the hijackers.
"Saturday Night Live" even included a few riffs about the tape that were
slightly sympathetic to the suicide bombers and parodied the towers
falling.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems the time that elapses between catastrophes and comic takes
on them grows shorter and shorter," says Steve O'Donnell, a New
York-based writer who has worked for Letterman and Chris Rock.</TE>
<TE>   "It took almost 100 years for jokes to emerge about Lincoln's
assassination--as in 'What did you think of the play, Mrs. Lincoln?'--and
less than a decade about John F. Kennedy's death."</TE>
<TE>   That said, O'Donnell says the smart-aleck "American spirit is not only
condonable but actually is to be encouraged." However, he has yet to hear
"really tasteless jokes--no deaths of civilians or servicemen made light
of."</TE>
<TE>   However, the commercialization of the tragedy began within weeks of
Sept. 11 and has grown exponentially. Framed posters of the New York
skyline featuring a ghostly image of the twin towers have tested the line
between commercialization and commemoration. Now, every type of clothing
article emblazoned with Sept. 11 reminders is being sold around ground
zero. Infant bibs, socks, nighties, ski caps (in black and gray) come
with "9/11-Ground Zero" on them.</TE>
<TE>   Also, within weeks of Sept. 11, a race ensued to trademark the last
known words of hero Todd Beamer, who was heard saying, "Let's roll" on an
in-flight phone as passengers prepared to confront hijackers on the plane
that crashed in a Pennsylvania field.</TE>
<TE>   A foundation set up in Beamer's name applied for the trademark for
"Let's roll" but found itself in an ongoing competition with at least a
dozen others that wanted to make money from his heroic words by putting
them on T-shirts, sweatshirts and fireworks displays.</TE>
<TE>   Jack L. Williams, 59, a contractor from Grosse Pointe, Mich., applied
for the trademark on Sept. 24. He was quoted as saying: "I don't care
what your name is, it's first in, first swim. It's all about good old
American capitalism."</TE>
<TE>Perspective Is Everything</TE>
<TE>   The speed at which the event has receded from people's minds has a lot
to do, in many instances, with how far they were from the scenes of
destruction Sept. 11. The Rev. Debbie Little, an Episcopal priest from
Boston who happened to be a block from the World Trade Center that day,
said she is now living in a private world of worry as she walks the
streets of her Cambridge neighborhood. Certainly, she has dear friends
who have listened patiently to her story of near-death. But most people
can't relate to what she went through.</TE>
<TE>   "I really thought the ground beneath me was safe," she said. "I still
think a lot about how that illusion was shattered."</TE>
<TE>   But she also knows there are people who were closer to the twin towers
that day who are even more troubled than she is six months later.</TE>
<TE>   "My terror is not as intense as somebody who was a half a block
closer. This made such a physical and psychic imprint on people," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising then that people hundreds of miles away from the
World Trade Center could not fully grasp the horror of nearly 3,000
people being killed in a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   People in small Oregon towns found that they could feel connected to
the event only by reading daily portraits of the dead in the Oregonian
newspaper in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are my children and my grown grandchildren," Florence
Bancroft, 71, of Portland wrote in January to the newspaper's ombudsman
after he announced the Oregonian would stop reprinting the mini-profiles
that had first run in the New York Times. "Their stories help tie our
country together across the expanse of our nation in a special bond."</TE>
<TE>   It may be that New York's reaction to the catastrophe also helped the
rest of the country get past the trauma. The relentlessly upbeat Giuliani
drove many Americans back to their daily routines.</TE>
<TE>   "New York was the strong widow saying, 'Hey, we're New York. It's OK,'
" said Tom Gilmore, a downtown Los Angeles loft developer who used to
live in New York and wears cuff links that look like subway tokens as a
reminder of his roots.</TE>
<TE>   "If this tragedy recedes from the conscience of America because we're
strong, that's OK," he added. "If it recedes because we're hardened or we
don't care, that's not OK."</TE>

<HD>Reaching Out to Democrats, McCain Embraces the Buddy System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the 2000 election, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has had more
success constructing alliances across party lines than any politician in
recent memory. McCain is now collaborating with Democrats on a stunning
array of major policy proposals. It's the political equivalent of Willie
Nelson teaming with Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow. McCain has emerged as a
one-man fusion movement; he's become the most hyphenated name in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Best known is McCain-Feingold, the campaign finance reform bill McCain
has steered to the edge of President Bush's desk with Sen. Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.). But there's also McCain-Edwards-Kennedy, the patients'
bill of rights he guided through the Senate last year with Democrats John
Edwards of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Not to
mention McCain-Hollings, the bill to federalize airport security workers
that McCain and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) forced into law last
fall over Bush's objections.</LD>
<TE>   There's more. McCain, in other partnerships with Democrats, has joined
with Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana on a bill to vastly expand national
service opportunities for young people. He has introduced two bills with
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut--one to require background checks
on sales at gun shows, the second to establish a commission to study the
government's failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. They are drafting a
third--a plan to use market forces to drive reductions in the gases
associated with global warming. And in the energy debate starting this
week in the Senate, McCain is likely to partner with Hollings and
Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry on a measure to squeeze more miles per
gallon from cars and SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   McCain began hyphenating regularly during the Clinton years, working
with Democrats on normalizing relations with Vietnam and efforts to
reduce teen smoking. But his outreach has greatly intensified since his
2000 race against Bush in the GOP presidential primary. That campaign
broadened McCain's interests--sharpening his focus on questions such as
reforming health maintenance organizations--and lengthened his reach. "I
don't think there is any doubt that the increased visibility of the
campaign increased the influence I can have over the legislative
process," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Inclination and capacity have merged to carry McCain into a unique
position. His ability to force issues into the public eye and his
reputation for independence makes him the ideal collaborator for "third
way" Democrats looking to establish bipartisan credibility for their
ideas. "Every Democrat with a centrist idea tries to sign McCain on as a
lead partner," says Bruce Reed, president of the moderate Democratic
Leadership Council. At the same time, McCain has grown more open to those
alliances--and aggressive about pursuing his own--as he has hardened his
conviction that only ideas with appeal across party lines can succeed in
a Congress so narrowly divided. That narrow division has strengthened his
hand, too, by maximizing the leverage of mavericks on either side who are
willing to vote across party lines.</TE>
<TE>   McCain and Bush have generally managed to avoid personal acrimony,
especially after Sept. 11. And McCain has supported the administration on
many foreign policy issues (like targeting Iraq). But McCain's alliances
with Democrats have become a systematic challenge to Bush's control of
the domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The practical effect of McCain's partnerships is always to tilt the
Senate balance of power away from the White House position. As the price
of his participation, McCain usually forces Democrats to moderate their
ideas. But the resulting proposals still point the policy further in a
Democratic direction than the White House likes. McCain's patients' bill
of rights contained a broader right to sue than Bush preferred; his
campaign finance reform bill imposed stricter limits on "soft
money"--unlimited contributions to the national political parties--than
Bush wanted. Bush proposed voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions; McCain would make them mandatory. The list goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are times," McCain acknowledges, "when this angers some
of my colleagues." That's an understatement. Except for the airport
security bill, most Senate Republicans typically have opposed the ideas
McCain is producing with Democrats; just nine Republicans voted for his
HMO bill, and only 12 for his campaign finance legislation. House
Republicans are even more hostile, and the White House is permanently
wary. One senior GOP operative close to the administration angrily likens
McCain to Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords, whose decision to quit the GOP
and become an independent last year gave the Democrats control of the
Senate. "He is acting like Jeffords," the operative complained. "He is
just not switching parties."</TE>
<TE>   Yet McCain and his supporters, with some justification, argue that his
cross-pollination could represent not only a threat but an opportunity
for Bush. McCain's team maintains that, by forging compromises with
Democrats, the senator is providing Bush a road map for staying close to
centrist swing voters he might otherwise alienate by drifting too far to
the right. Though the administration, for instance, didn't want to
federalize airport security workers, McCain believes eventually "they may
look back with some gratitude" on that move as they tout the tightened
security in 2004. Likewise, McCain predicts, "If we get a patients' bill
of rights, the president will sign it and get credit for it."</TE>
<TE>   McCain's partnerships could have lasting impact whether or not he wins
Bush's signature for most of his proposals--or even whether the senator
carries these ideas into another presidential bid. With his Democratic
collaborators, McCain is filling in what he sketched out in 2000: a
muscular, reforming nationalism distinct from conventional thinking in
either party. In effect, he's providing a future progressive presidential
candidate--Republican, Democrat or independent--with an agenda targeted
precisely at the elusive center of the divided U.S. electorate. He's
writing the platform for a campaign that doesn't yet exist.</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely to run for the White House again himself, McCain may now be
playing a role like the great Senate progressives who helped clear the
path for the New Deal with their (mostly unsuccessful) legislative
crusades during the laissez faire years of the 1920s. Like those distant
predecessors, McCain is defining a genuinely new political voice, one
that may echo long after his own fades.</TE>

<LD>A 61-cent increase in Connecticut's cigarette tax has Gov. John
Rowland in trouble with his mother.</LD>
<LD>   Cerie Rowland, 70 and a pack-a-day smoker, blasted the increase pushed
by her son as unfair. "Why pick on us? It's absolutely illogical."</LD>
<LD>   Not content to voice her unhappiness to her son, Rowland is leading a
campaign by her eight-member bridge club--all smokers--to fight the
higher tax.</LD>
<TE>   She also complained that the tax was not extended to cigars, pipes and
other forms of tobacco. The governor is known to enjoy an occasional
cigar.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother's been hard at work," the governor said after the
Legislature approved his plan to raise the cigarette tax from 50 cents to
$1.11 per pack as of April 3.</TE>

<HD>Brig That Held Lindh Casts Spell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS PELELIU, off Southern California
</DL>
<LD>For weeks, the brig on this amphibious assault ship kept one of the
most infamous prisoners of the U.S. war on terrorism: American John
Walker Lindh.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the brig has become a "must-see" for several hundred seagoing
tourists--family members who are returning with sailors and Marines after
a seven-month deployment in the Arabian Sea and Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The family members, who have spent a week on the ship, were eager to
see the spot that once housed the Marin County man who stands accused of
conspiring to kill U.S. citizens and providing support to foreign
terrorist organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Many rated their visit to the brig as the highlight of the cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a piece of history; I just had to see it," said Sara Falk of
Brea, whose son-in-law is a Marine corporal. "I can tell my grandchildren
that I saw where John Walker, the American [Talib], was kept."</TE>
<TE>   "I actually sat on his bed," said Pam Landis of Danville, Ill., the
mother of a Marine corporal. Organizers of the family program arranged
tours of the brig--which also housed eight Taliban and Al Qaeda
soldiers--as part of the seven-day cruise from Hawaii to San Diego, which
ends this morning when the ship docks at the 32nd Street Naval Station.</TE>
<TE>   There were restrictions, however. No photographs could be taken. And
the Marine guards--on duty even though the brig is now empty--would turn
away all questions with a knowing smile. A highlight of the tour was the
chance to see a framed photograph on the wall of Lindh arriving on the
Peleliu, flanked by the ship's security chief and a Navy corpsman.</TE>
<TE>   Taken into custody by U.S. officials after the uprising at the
Mazar-i-Sharif prison, Lindh was first taken to the Marine outpost called
Camp Rhino in southern Afghanistan; he was held in a large metal
container, tended by medical personnel, questioned by FBI agents and kept
away from reporters.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 14, Lindh was transferred by helicopter to the Peleliu, where
he remained until Dec. 30. He was kept in a nine-bed brig under 24-hour
watch by Marine guards, chosen because of their martial arts training. A
high-pressure fire hose was available if Lindh or any of the other
prisoners caused a disturbance.</TE>
<TE>   On the Peleliu, the prisoners were given blue jumpsuits with numbers.
Lindh was "No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Dirty, bearded and malnourished, Lindh was visited several times each
day by doctors and nurses. Taken under guard from the brig to the ship's
hospital, Lindh underwent surgery to remove a bullet from his thigh.</TE>
<TE>   At the insistence of security officials, he was given a local, not a
general, anesthetic so he would not lose consciousness. Once the surgery
was finished, Lindh asked repeatedly to see the bullet.</TE>
<TE>   But the bullet already had been seized by officials for possible
evidence at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the brig, Lindh and the other prisoners were docile and presented
no problems for the guards. One of the ship's barbers came to the brig to
give Lindh a haircut and beard trim.</TE>
<TE>   To keep curious sailors and Marines from attempting to catch a glimpse
of Lindh and the other prisoners, the passageway near the brig was ruled
off-limits. Even when he and the others were transferred to the Navy ship
Bataan, their identities were shielded to prevent gawking and
picture-taking.</TE>
<TE>   Medical personnel and high-ranking officers who visited Lindh said
they stifled the urge to ask him why he allegedly turned against his
country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I would have understood even if he had explained it to
me," said Capt. William Jezierski, commodore of the three-ship Peleliu
Amphibious Ready Group. "I really don't."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Peleliu family members--called "Tigers" in military
jargon--came away from the brig visit happy for the opportunity but
unsure what to think of Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see it [the brig] so bad, I couldn't wait," said Tina
Dalk of Petaluma, Calif., whose son is a sailor. "I just don't understand
what that boy must have been thinking."</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Withholding War Information, Daschle Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush has not been forthcoming about progress in the war
on terrorism or about a "secret government" operating since Sept. 11,
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, lawmakers are finding it difficult to carry out their
constitutional duties of approving money for the war and providing
oversight of the executive branch, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "None of us knew about the secret government," Daschle said on "Fox
News Sunday," referring to the cadre of senior bureaucrats sent on a
rotating basis to two undisclosed locations to ensure continuity of
government if a terrorist strike hits Washington.</LD>
<TE>   That, he said, is a "profound illustration of the chasm that exists
sometimes with information. . . . It's an illustration of the need for a
better communications process."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also said that Congress had not been sufficiently briefed on
expansion of the war on terrorism. U.S. troops are already in the
Philippines to train local anti-terror forces and may soon go to Yemen
and the former Soviet republic of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Congress needs "to better understand what our purpose is, how long
will we be there, how many troops will be there, how does it affect our
efforts in Afghanistan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation," Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, agreed
that "the administration could, at this point, do a better job of
involving members of Congress in some of the discussions about where the
war is going."</TE>
<TE>   The senators' comments brought a quick rebuke from Republicans, who
said they broke a tradition of keeping a unified front while troops are
in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   "Any sign that we are losing that unity, or crack in that support,
will be, I think, used against us overseas," Senate Minority Leader Trent
Lott (R-Miss.) said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Two shuttle astronauts ventured out into open space early Monday to
install a new, stronger solar wing on the Hubble Space Telescope.</LD>
<LD>   John Grunsfeld and Richard Linnehan emerged from space shuttle
Columbia high above Africa, in the first of five excursions planned this
week to enhance Hubble. "Oh, wow, beautiful view," Grunsfeld said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's time to go outside and turn some wrenches," Mission Control told
the astronauts following their successful capture of the telescope.</LD>
<TE>   The crew latched onto Hubble on Sunday and watched with relief as its
40-foot solar wings neatly rolled up like window shades.</TE>
<TE>   NASA was unsure whether Hubble's electricity-generating solar panels
would retract properly, given eight years of harsh space exposure. The
astronauts were prepared to toss them overboard if they got stuck.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite cool to watch the solar arrays retract so smoothly on
the big screen down here," Mission Control told the crew.</TE>
<TE>   Grunsfeld, the chief telescope repairman, was thrilled to encounter
Hubble again. "It's great to see an old friend," said the spaceman, who
was on the last servicing mission in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Astronaut Nancy Currie plucked the 24,500-pound, 43-foot observatory
from orbit, using Columbia's robot arm. She moved in slowly for the grab

<HD>Priest Leaves Sad, Angry Congregants</HD>
<DH>Religion: Members of the Orange County church are stunned as leader
of 12 years is forced out after admitting to sexual misconduct with teen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the congregants filed out of a Catholic church in south Orange
County on Sunday, some were angry, others in tears. All were stunned.
They had just learned that their priest for the last 12 years had been
forced to resign because, at one point in his ministry, he had sexually
molested a teenager.</LD>
<LD>   In stark contrast to the secrecy with which the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles has dismissed up to a dozen priests in recent weeks, the members
of San Francisco Solano Church learned from their priest at the end of
Mass that he was leaving them. They would learn more, Father Michael
Pecharich told them, from a one-page letter they would be handed as they
left.</LD>
<LD>   The congregants gave the departing priest a standing ovation, then
shuffled out to receive the letters, which said that 19 years ago,
Pecharich had "transgressed the personal boundaries of an adolescent." As
a result of the Diocese of Orange's new "zero tolerance" policy for
priests who sexually abuse minors, he had been asked to leave.</LD>
<TE>Parishioners Are Outraged, Saddened</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard and meeting rooms of the Rancho Santa Margarita
church, parishioners passionately debated the news, some visibly
trembling while others raised their voices, rubbed red eyes or hugged
each other.</TE>
<TE>   Parents angrily asked why they hadn't been told before that their
priest had this sexual impropriety in his background. Diocese officials
said they have known since 1996, when the victim, who was a teenage boy
at the time of the molestation, came forward.</TE>
<TE>   Others wondered about the meaning of redemption in the church: Why was
Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown taking such drastic measures when the
misdeed had occurred 19 years ago, Pecharich had confessed to it and had
lived an apparently blameless life since?</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happened, happened 19 years ago," said Hilda Glenski, who
teaches Sunday school at the church. "The diocese has known about it. Why
now?"</TE>
<TE>   The reason is that the diocese, along with the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles, recently reached a $5.2-million settlement in a sexual
molestation lawsuit that requires it to dismiss any employees who have
been found to have committed such acts.</TE>
<TE>   Some congregants floated the idea of naming the new parish hall after
Pecharich as a tribute, which brought an enraged outburst from one man
who said they must be crazy. "Don't put this man on a pedestal," the man
said, noting that he has children who attend the church.</TE>
<TE>   The polarized debate mirrors a similar soul-searching taking place
across the country as the U.S. Catholic Church grapples with the largest
molestation scandal in its history, and what to do with clergy who have
sexual molestation of minors in their background.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich's victim declined to press charges and never filed suit,
church officials said. He came forward because he wanted to prevent
something similar from happening to another boy, officials added, and
because he wanted an apology, which Pecharich gave him.</TE>
<TE>   For the last week, a special diocesan task force, made up of two
attorneys, two psychologists and two priests, has been poring through the
personnel file of every Roman Catholic clergy member in Orange County,
looking for proven allegations of sexual abuse of minors. Church
officials said Pecharich has been the only priest so far to trigger the
zero-tolerance mechanism, but it would take about two more weeks to
finish the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he won't ask the Vatican to remove Pecharich, 57, from the
priesthood, but he has been stripped of the ability to perform official
Catholic functions such as baptisms, funerals or Communions. And he no
longer will have a job with the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "The church for so long has thought if they put these priests in
treatment, then they are fine to go back into circulation," said
Katherine K. Freberg, an Irvine attorney who represented Ryan DiMaria in
the case against Msgr. Michael Harris, a popular principal at Santa
Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita. "History has
shown this not to be the case."</TE>
<TE>   A diocesan official told concerned San Francisco Solano congregants
that the priest will "receive financial assistance" from the diocese,
"for as long as he wants or needs it."</TE>
<TE>   "[Pecharich] is effective and well-liked, but you can't make
exceptions to the policy," Brown said. "It's painful, but it's good from
the standpoint that we will not put any child at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the policy allows him to tell parishioners that the diocese
doesn't have any known child molesters in its ministries. Before the
zero-tolerance was adopted, priests found sexually abusing minors were
often sent to counseling and put on probation, but allowed to return to
the ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich was the founding pastor of San Francisco Solano, which has
grown up along with the surrounding city of Rancho Santa Margarita and
now has more than 16,000 congregants. Known as a prodigious fund-raiser
and top-notch manager, the priest was able to raise millions of dollars
to build a 1,000-seat sanctuary, education buildings and meeting halls in
little more than 12 years.</TE>
<TE>Two High-Profile Priests Are Removed</TE>
<TE>   He is the second high-profile Orange County priest to be ousted from
his church in the last year after past sexual misconduct had surfaced.
Father John Lenihan was removed in September from St. Edward Church in
Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan's removal came a month after the Los Angeles and Orange
dioceses paid a record $5.2 million to settle sexual abuse allegations
brought against Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The church also apologized to four other alleged victims. San
Francisco Solano is located adjacent to Santa Margarita Catholic High and
held services in the school gym for years until its sanctuary was built.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement also was another hit to the morale of local priests,
who have had to weather numerous sexual molestation scandals and now
sometimes take off their Roman collars when at the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked and saddened by the whole situation," said Father Alex
Kim, who served at the church with Pecharich and is now director of the
county's Korean Martyrs Catholic Center in Westminster. "With the
atmosphere these days, the church doesn't have many options."</TE>

<HD>Physicians Fold Under Malpractice Fee Burden</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>The cost of medical malpractice insurance is increasing upward of
fourfold in some states, forcing doctors from Pennsylvania to
Arizona--and now Nevada--to close their practices.</LD>
<LD>   In Las Vegas, more than 10% of the doctors are expected by summer to
quit or relocate, plunging the city toward crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Already, specialists are becoming harder to find around the country
and trauma centers that treat life-threatening emergencies are closing.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is growing. Doctors in Oregon have been told to brace for
"breathtaking" increases in malpractice insurance premiums in coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The turmoil began when the St. Paul Cos. of Minnesota, the nation's
second largest malpractice insurer, announced in December it would no
longer renew policies for 42,000 doctors nationwide. The insurer said it
had lost nearly $1 billion in its malpractice business last year. Other
companies are offering coverage, but charging much higher rates to avoid
the losses encountered by St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is particularly acute in Las Vegas, home to two-thirds
of the state population, because 60% of its 1,700 doctors were insured by
St. Paul. Replacement policies are costing some doctors four or five
times as much--$200,000 or higher annually, more than most doctors'
take-home pay.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, dozens of doctors have closed their offices in Las
Vegas, which already has a shortage of physicians.</TE>
<TE>   In January, 30 doctors complained to Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, and he
instructed the state insurance commissioner to hold hearings today here
and in Carson City.</TE>
<TE>   Those facing the largest rate increases are doctors who perform the
highest-risk procedures, including obstetricians, specialty surgeons and
emergency room physicians. Doctors say they can't pass the additional
costs along to patients because they are reimbursed by government and
commercial insurance programs that have negotiated set fees.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Cheryl Edwards, 41, closed her decade-old obstetrics and
gynecology practice in suburban Henderson because her insurance jumped
from $37,000 to $150,000 a year. She moved her practice to West Los
Angeles, leaving behind 30 pregnant patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy in Las Vegas," she said, "but I had no choice but to
leave."</TE>
<TE>   In California--where juries hearing malpractice lawsuits are limited
to maximum awards of $250,000 for pain and suffering--Edwards' insurance
premium this year is $17,000. Because of 1975 tort reform, doctors in
California are largely unaffected by increasing insurance rates. But the
situation is dire in states such as Nevada where there is no monetary
cap.</TE>
<TE>   "Las Vegas is on the edge of having its health care system implode,"
said Larry Matheis, executive director of the Nevada State Medical Assn.
"I expect between 200 and 250 physicians will be looking either at
bankruptcy, closing their offices and quitting, or leaving Nevada. This
is a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada state legislators have begun drafting bills to address the
problem. One early proposal would limit pain and suffering damages to 10%
of actual economic losses from malpractice.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature, however, isn't scheduled to meet for a year. Dr.
Frank Jordan--a 31-year veteran of vascular surgery, including 13 years
in Las Vegas--couldn't wait. He closed his practice and retired.</TE>
<TE>'I Obviously Can't Afford That'</TE>
<TE>   "I did the math," the 56-year-old doctor said. "If I were to stay in
business for three years, it would cost me $1.2 million for insurance. I
obviously can't afford that. I'd be bankrupt after the first year, and
I'd just be working for the insurance company. What's the point?"</TE>
<TE>   Even before the current crisis, Las Vegas was hard pressed recruiting
doctors; many with young families dismissed Sin City. Now even more
doctors are steering clear of Las Vegas because of the escalating
malpractice premiums and the perception that it is highly litigious,
medical group executives complain.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of a medical system that is growing, we're seeing one that's
taking steps backward and which may never recover," Matheis said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada ranks 47th in the nation for its ratio of 196 doctors per
100,000 population. By comparison, Massachusetts ranks first among the
states, with 2 1/2 times as many doctors per capita as Nevada, according
to the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>Nevada Doctors Have Some Protections</TE>
<TE>   Nevada does not limit the amount of jury awards, but trial lawyers
here say other protections are in place for doctors. People wanting to
sue a doctor must first make their case before a medical legal screening
panel, supported by a doctor who agrees with their allegation. If the
panel finds there is no malpractice, the plaintiff may still sue in
court--but if he loses there, he must then pay the doctor's defense
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bradley of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Assn. said the highest award
from a Nevada jury has been $6 million, and that the number of claims
filed against doctors has increased in proportion to the region's growth.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence of frivolous cases and exorbitant awards in
Nevada," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, St. Paul lost $1.88 in Nevada for every dollar paid by
doctors, spokeswoman Andrea Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   If the state, after today's hearing, finds that malpractice insurance
is either unavailable or unaffordable, it has several options.</TE>
<TE>   It can temporarily underwrite the cost of the premiums, or establish
its own insurance fund to provide malpractice coverage for the state's
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Nevada did in 1975, when another malpractice insurance
crisis swept through the country. The state created an insurance pool
that was then converted to a physician-owned insurance company. It
thrived and became publicly traded but, in 1995 when it had difficulty
buying backup insurance to protect itself from catastrophic claims, it
was sold by its investors--to St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and others argue that the long-term solution to the
malpractice insurance problem is tort reform to limit jury awards, as 24
states have done.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say California provides the model; its $250,000 cap for
pain-and-suffering awards has withstood court challenge, even while
similar legislation in other states has been struck down by their state
supreme courts.</TE>
<TE>Multimillion-Dollar Jury Awards Seen</TE>
<TE>   When the Oregon Supreme Court in 1999 rejected as unconstitutional a
$500,000 lid on pain-and-suffering awards in malpractice cases, jury
awards of $8 million, $10 million and $17 million swiftly followed.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's 2,000 doctors should expect sharply increased rates, said the
executive director of the Oregon Medical Assn., which is negotiating
malpractice insurance premiums on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll know by the 1st of May what those premiums will be, and the
reaction will be breathtaking," Bob Dernedde said. "Doctors may quit.
We'll have some serious problems."</TE>
<TE>   The fallout is being felt around the country. The Arizona border town
of Bisbee has lost its hospital maternity ward because four of the town's
six obstetricians can no longer afford to practice.</TE>
<TE>   In Mississippi, physicians were able to get coverage only after Lloyds
of London agreed to an $80,000 monthly policy to keep the only trauma
center opened between Memphis, Tenn., and Jackson, Miss.</TE>
<TE>Trauma Centers Close Over High Costs</TE>
<TE>   Both trauma centers in Wheeling, W.Va., have closed because their
neurosurgeons couldn't pay their new malpractice premiums. The trauma
center at Abington Memorial Hospital outside Philadelphia faces closure
next month as its doctors scramble to find affordable insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas' only trauma center has announced it will close for 12 hours
March 12 because two of its eight trauma surgeons can't afford insurance
premiums. People in southern Nevada needing emergency surgery during that
period will be airlifted to hospitals in Southern California, Phoenix,
Reno or Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Even doctors in specialties less prone to lawsuits say they are being
pinched by the volatility of the insurance market.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Rosemary Hyun and her husband, Dr. Kenneth Misch, founded Desert
Valley Pediatrics eight years ago and built it into a 14-doctor office.
They had to lay off one doctor and another quit because malpractice
insurance increased from $1,000 to $4,000 a month per doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "That may not seem like a lot in the grand scheme of things," Hyun
said, "but we get paid in 30s and 60s [dollars], not thousands."</TE>
<TE>   To pay for the premiums and a $150,000 surcharge for coverage against
lawsuits that predate the new policy, Hyun said the group borrowed
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't make any money this year," she said. "It's going to take us
two years to recover from what's happened."</TE>

<HD>Fresno Finally Throws Wake for Literary Lion</HD>

<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>Twenty years after he uttered one of the great parting
lines--"Everybody has got to die, but I have always believed an exception
would be made in my case. Now what?"--the ashes of writer William Saroyan
were buried Sunday in the town where his genius first sprang.</LD>
<LD>   The roundabout nature of his final journey, which came amid Fresno's
first Saroyan Festival, would have delighted the author and playwright to
no end. Never short on confidence, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize and an
Oscar, Saroyan figured he was too out-sized to be kept in one place.</LD>
<LD>   Half his ashes were shipped in 1982 to a memorial in Armenia, and the
other half sat in obscurity in an urn on a chapel shelf here. Now on a
springlike day filled with the sweet smell of apricot blossoms, those
ashes were laid to rest in a grave beside the railroad tracks on the
outskirts of town.</LD>
<TE>   It was a fitting spot for Fresno's most famous native son, whose
writings put the town on the world map but also poked fun at it.</TE>
<TE>   All around Ararat Cemetery were the markers of the Armenian immigrants
he brought to life in his short stories ("My Name is Aram," 1940), novels
("The Human Comedy," 1943), plays ("My Heart's in the Highlands," 1939)
and songs. Here were cousins who stole beautiful white horses and farmers
who swore they were poets and mothers who could feed a houseful of
strangers with one chicken and five ripe pears.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Aram, and daughter, Lucy, who had spent years trying to come
to peace with their father's life and legend, listened with a handful of
his old friends and dignitaries as the priest of the First Armenian
Presbyterian Church prayed over the black granite headstone.</TE>
<TE>   Saroyan, of course, had written his own epitaph:</TE>
<TE>   "In the time of your life, live--so that in that wondrous time you
shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world but shall smile at
the infinite delight and mystery of it."</TE>
<TE>   This town, which still isn't quite sure what to make of Saroyan, dead
or alive, had spent the previous two days celebrating the work of its
greatest export, if you don't count the raisin. The ongoing 2-month-long
festival of theater productions, philharmonic concerts, museum exhibits
and literary talks is an attempt to revive a writer who rose to soaring
heights in the 1930s and '40s but has long since fallen out of critical
favor.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a way for Fresno, spreading out into the mass form of
Wal-Marts and McDonald's it now shares with every other city, to find a
way back to its past.</TE>
<TE>   For his few friends still living, the community's bow to the exuberant
Armenian with the walrus mustache and deep belly laugh is years past due.</TE>
<TE>   They have never quite forgiven city fathers for refusing to keep a
treasure trove of unpublished manuscripts and memorabilia that secured
Saroyan's place as one of America's most prolific writers and pack rats.
After years of gathering dust, the collection was shipped away in boxes,
first to UC Berkeley and then to Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer volume--from his frayed shoelaces to his mustache clippings
to the pebbles he collected on his furious bike rides through town to the
words that never stopped pouring out of his Royal typewriter--takes up
more than 250 feet of shelf space.</TE>
<TE>   The collection of another California literary lion, John Steinbeck,
whose 100-year birthday is being celebrated this month in his hometown of
Salinas, measures a mere 20 linear feet.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many Armenians, the Saroyans had come to this land of grapes
and peaches in 1908 to escape the pogroms of Ottoman Turkey. Saroyan's
father, Armenak, a minister and frustrated poet, died when William was 3.
Death would become one of the central obsessions of Saroyan's work.</TE>
<TE>   "Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat,
and when you sleep, really sleep," he once wrote to aspiring writers.
"Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when
you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry.
Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough."</TE>
<TE>   High school couldn't contain him, and he dropped out at 15, continuing
his education at the public library, bedazzled by Edgar Lee Master's
"Spoon River Anthology." When he wasn't reading, he was walking the ditch
banks and fields, discovering the eternal struggle between the horned
toad, which was trying to hold on to his world, and the farmer, who was
trying to engineer a new one.</TE>
<TE>   "Fresno had a great early appeal for me," he wrote. "It had a fine
smell of dust, of the desert, of rocks baking in the sun . . . of leaf
and blossom and fruit."</TE>
<TE>   By 18, he wanted nothing more than to leave its small town "rot and
decay and ferment." He moved to San Francisco and then bought a one-way
train ticket to New York City. He proceeded to write a short story every
day in a bursting, spontaneous style.</TE>
<TE>A Difficult Start in New York City</TE>
<TE>   Just as swiftly came the rejection letters from magazine editors. Who
was this cocky kid who dared to riff a whole page on the miracle of
breathing?</TE>
<TE>   Holed up in the Mills Hotel, he considered calling it quits but had
only $50, too little for the train fare home. On New Year's Day 1929, he
wrote to his best pal, Yep Moradian, about his desire to return to a
simple life of pruning vines:</TE>
<TE>   "Xmas brought me the flu; fever 104; burning hot in sweat; no friends;
too homesick to want to die; had dreams for four days and nights of home
and the old scenes and meals. I am positive now that I am a God damn
fool."</TE>
<TE>   His fever broke, and he turned it into a story about a
poverty-stricken young writer with only tap water and Proust to fill his
belly. The publication of "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" in
1934 was the break Saroyan needed.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 15 years, his work was everywhere--in short stories and
novels, on Broadway and on records, including the hit song by Rosemary
Clooney, "Come On-a My House," which he wrote in the idiom of an Armenian
woman trying to entice a guest with figs and dates and nuts and cakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Saroyan was a lot more than a short story writer," said Bob
Setrakian, a local farm boy who became a San Francisco businessman and
heads the foundation overseeing Saroyan's legacy. "He worked in all the
art forms and drew and painted almost every day."</TE>
<TE>   Setrakian said it was bad enough that some of Saroyan's finest stories
were out of print and he couldn't interest a single publisher in the
boxes of never-before-seen manuscripts. But then to realize that so much
of Saroyan's life and work was unknown to the people who should know him
best--the residents of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   So Setrakian shared the idea of a festival with local impresario Larry
Balakian. Before he knew it, Balakian had signed on more than 29
nonprofit organizations and scores of volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Winemakers at Cal State Fresno bottled a 2000 vintage Saroyan Syrah.
The nation's first bus "graphically wrapped" in the visage of a writer,
the "Saroyan bus," hit the streets last week.</TE>
<TE>   There was no attempt during the festival's opening weekend to slap
varnish on Saroyan's complex legend. Whether it was a museum exhibit or a
literary symposium, he was portrayed with all his conceit and vices and
desire to "hang in there and wrestle death to a draw, at least."</TE>
<TE>   At a reception to honor her old friend, Roxie Moradian, Yep's widow,
recalled when Saroyan was one of the most talked about writers in the
world. The self-doubt of the fatherless boy, who grew up in a town that
barred Armenians from country clubs and elite subdivisions, seemed
vanished.</TE>
<TE>   This was a Saroyan who bragged that he could write an entire play in
three days and then wrote the Pulitzer Prize winner, "The Time of Your
Life," in six days. He ended up rejecting the prize because the play was
"no more great than anything else I have ever written."</TE>
<TE>   What he never quite mastered was family life. He married Carol Marcus,
a New York debutante, and they had two children together. They divorced,
remarried and divorced again before she wound up with actor Walter
Matthau.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, estranged from his children, Saroyan split time
between Paris and Fresno. Broke from playing the ponies and roulette
tables and owing the IRS a debt no writer in his 50s could pay, he turned
inward to a life of documenting every external facet of his existence.</TE>
<TE>   When he finished eating a can of green beans, for instance, he would
neatly take off the label and sign the backside with the year, month, day
and hour. He did the same with his Metro tickets from France, playing
cards, typewriter ribbons, rocks he picked up off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Saroyan's last gesture, while seemingly mad, was really the
final selfless act of a writer. By putting his signature to the items of
everyday life, he was documenting everyday life," said Aris Janigian, a
professor of Humanities at the Southern California Institute of
Architecture.</TE>
<TE>Half His Ashes in Fresno Since 1981</TE>
<TE>   Saroyan died in 1981 at 72, and his ashes, at least half of them, have
sat in Fresno's Chapel of Light in a golden urn inscribed, "Author and
Humanitarian." Aram Saroyan said it was only right that his father's
remains come to rest in Ararat Cemetery, where he used to wander the
grounds in the rain, talking to the headstones.</TE>
<TE>   On a bright, cloudless Sunday, about 20 friends and family huddled
around a huge black stone imported from India. A hole had been dug among
the names Garabedian, Simonian and Krikorian.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome home, dear friend, dear writer," said Kevin Starr, author and
California state librarian. "Welcome home to the place that haunted and
nurtured you across a lifetime. Be at peace, Bill. Be at peace."</TE>

<HD>Mahony Ousts Priests in Sex Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Church sources say as many as 12 are involved. They are
quietly fired or forced to retire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As many as a dozen Southern California priests who were involved in
past sexual abuse cases have been directed by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to
retire or otherwise leave their ministries.</LD>
<LD>   The forced retirements, which church sources said ranged from at least
half a dozen to 12 priests, were the latest repercussions in the growing
scandal of priestly sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church in the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The church's Los Angeles Archdiocese made no public announcement of
the dismissals, which occurred during the last two weeks. Numerous
efforts seeking comment from officials were unsuccessful.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate case, a popular Orange County priest who admitted
molesting a teenage boy 19 years ago bid farewell to his parish Sunday.
Father Michael Pecharich was asked to leave last week by the Bishop of
Orange, the Most Rev. Tod D. Brown. Pecharich's case had been known to
the church since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   None of the priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese are believed to be
involved in any recent cases of sexually abusing minors. Their cases
occurred as long as a decade ago, and all had undergone psychological
counseling, according to one of the sources.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, since the scandal over the sexual abuse of minors erupted
anew in the Boston archdiocese last month, dioceses across the country,
including the Diocese of Orange and Diocese of San Bernardino, have been
under increasing pressure to rid themselves of any priests with a history
of sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Boston sent a red alert," said one church source, who asked not to be
named because it would aggravate his relations with superiors.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church has been dogged for decades by sporadic complaints
of child molestation. But the magnitude of the Boston case and several
high-profile settlements of civil suits by the church have drawn unusual
attention. In Boston, the archdiocese was found to have known for years
about, but failed to act against, a priest who had been accused of
molesting 130 children.</TE>
<TE>   As that scandal mushroomed, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston reluctantly
turned over to law enforcement officials the names of 80 priests who had
been accused of abusing children during the last 40 years. Boston's
action was soon followed by similar disclosures in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino on Sunday, the controversy prompted Bishop Gerald R.
Barnes to write an open letter to his parishes seeking to reassure
parishioners of his diocese's long-standing policy of removing errant
priests. Barnes also spoke on behalf of "good" priests whom he said have
been unfairly tarnished by the scandal.</TE>
<TE>Legal Outlook Is Uncertain</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Sunday whether the names of any of the priests in the
Los Angeles Archdiocese--which includes Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties--would be given to law enforcement authorities, or
whether any of the priests planned to appeal their dismissals.</TE>
<TE>   A knowledgeable law enforcement official said it did not appear any of
the cases had been previously referred for criminal prosecution by the
archdiocese. This official could recall only one referral of a priest for
criminal prosecution for molestation in the last several years. He said
that case resulted in a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese in past statements has promised to cooperate fully
with civil authorities and the legal system. Mahony, the archbishop of
Los Angeles, was a member of a national bishops conference committee that
recommended such steps.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it clear why the Los Angeles priests were being asked to leave
only now, since the archdiocese has had a stated policy since 1988 to
"never deal with a problem of sexual abuse on the part of a priest or
deacon by simply moving him to another ministerial assignment."</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with Mahony's actions suggested they were prompted
not only by the Boston scandal but by a 2001 court settlement in which
the Los Angeles archdiocese promised to rid itself of anyone who had been
found guilty of sexual abuse in the past, either by an admission or in
civil or church proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   That case involved a victim, Ryan DiMaria, who claimed he had been
sexually abused as a teenager by a priest at a church high school. The
$5.2-million settlement, approved by the dioceses of Los Angeles and
Orange, required the church to remove any other employee found to be
guilty of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaria's attorney, Katherine K. Freberg of Irvine, said she was
elated by the dismissals.</TE>
<TE>   "This was our very vision: that both Los Angeles and Orange would
literally go through their files and determine if they had any priests
that have molested someone, and that they get ousted," Freberg said. "I
cannot tell you how happy this makes me--and the way it's been played
out. I see this as the culmination of all the victims across the country
banding together and saying we will no longer live in the secrecy or
tolerate the cover-up."</TE>
<TE>   Of the targeted priests in the Los Angeles archdiocese, those who are
62 or older have been asked to retire. Younger priests were told that
their status as priests was now "inactive." Those who resided in a parish
rectory or other church facility were asked to move out.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a priest was said to have been given 72 hours to pack his
belongings and leave.</TE>
<TE>   In face-to-face meetings with Mahony, the priests were also reportedly
asked to consider leaving the priesthood entirely through a process
called laicization, a step rarely taken upon retirement, a knowledgeable
church source said. They were also offered what one churchman called a
"generous" severance package.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the dismissals came a week after Mahony issued a strongly
worded pastoral statement published in the archdiocesan weekly newspaper
in which he reiterated a "zero tolerance" policy when it comes to sexual
abuse of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony promised that the archdiocese "will not knowingly assign or
retain a priest, deacon, religious or layperson to serve in its parishes,
schools, pastoral ministries, or any other assignment when such an
individual is determined to have previously engaged in the sexual abuse
of a minor."</TE>
<TE>   The problem of child sexual abuse by priests threatens not only the
church's credibility but its finances. Various estimates by legal experts
have suggested the church had paid out hundreds of millions in
settlements over the years. The $5.2-million settlement in DiMaria's case
last year in Orange County is believed to be the largest sum involving a
single individual.</TE>
<TE>   One church source noted that if Mahony were accused of failing to
abide by the terms of the DiMaria settlement, his diocese would be
liable.</TE>
<TE>   "If he were accused of anything, his pockets are the deepest. He owns
everything," the source said. "Now the archbishop is able to answer
unequivocally when asked 'are you keeping any sexually abusing priests in
your archdiocese?' that the answer is an unequivocal no."</TE>
<TE>Mahony Voiced Concern to Peers</TE>
<TE>   Mahony became archbishop in 1986, two years before the archdiocese
said it adopted a sexual abuse policy. In 1992, Mahony publicly expressed
concern about clergy sexual abuse during a meeting of the U.S. Conference
of Catholic Bishops, then known as the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops. Meeting in Washington, the bishops conference hotel was picketed
by individuals who said they had been sexually abused as minors by
priests. The issue was not on the bishops' agenda, but they quickly
consented to a private meeting led by Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   "These were good people who have been deeply wounded by the misconduct
of some of our priests," Mahony said in reporting back to the bishops in
unscheduled public remarks. "These were people whose faith has been
shattered and in some cases lost."</TE>
<TE>   The bishops then voted unanimously to step up efforts to remain
vigilant against sexual abuse, but victims complained then that the
pledge was inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last month, the president of the bishops conference,
the Most Rev. Wilton D. Gregory of Belleville, Ill., renewed the pledge
by U.S. bishops to "continue to take all the steps necessary to protect
our youth from this kind of abuse in society and in the church."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory said the church was confident that "few" of the nation's
47,000 priests were involved in such conduct. "The damage, however, has
been immeasurable. The toll this phenomenon has taken on our people and
our ministry is tremendous. This is a time for Catholic people--bishops,
clergy, religious and laity--to resolve to work together to assure the
safety of our children," Gregory said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of Gregory's statement, the bishops conference announced an
Internet site that details church policies and actions taken to fight
sexual abuse. That site is www.usccb.org/comm/restoretrust.htm.</TE>
<TE>   How that will play out, however, is a difficult question as individual
bishops work to address the injury to and needs of victims and their
families, and to care for accused priests.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, one church source said the ousters suggested the
archdiocese had stopped dealing with priest molestation as a treatable
mental health problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The mental health model is being set aside and the criminal-justice
model is being inserted. So all you have for these priests is a
retribution model," the source said. "My fear is the church is going from
being careless in treating abused children to being careless in treating
abusing priests," the churchman said.</TE>
