<LD>The impasse that is keeping new federal judges off the bench and
impeding the judicial process brings to mind two aphorisms.</LD>
<LD>   1. What goes around comes around.</LD>
<LD>   For the eight years Bill Clinton was in the White House,
Republican senators charged with assessing candidates to the federal
bench ignored, patronized and humiliated the men and women the
president picked. Some of Clinton's nominees waited years before the
Republican-controlled Senate held a hearing or a vote. Those who did
get a hearing were often harangued for speeches they'd given or law
review articles they'd written 20 years before. The Senate rejected
Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White after then-Sen. John
Ashcroft baselessly labeled him "pro-criminal."</LD>
<TE>   In the end, Clinton got 374 judges confirmed in eight years,
compared with Ronald Reagan's 382 and the senior George Bush's 193 in
four years. But the pace was so slow and the Senate so vindictive
during Clinton's presidency that even Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist implored Republican senators to tone it down.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it's payback time, and with Democratic senators bedeviling
the Republican president, Rehnquist is again pleading. Of the 80
judicial nominations that George W. Bush made during his first year,
the Democrat-led Senate has confirmed only 28. With about 100 of the
862 judgeships now vacant, the remaining federal judges are buried
under burgeoning court dockets. To that oppressive workload add the
yawning income gap between salaried federal judges and lawyers in
private practice and the lengthy, bruising confirmation battles. It's
little wonder that Rehnquist and others worry that the federal
judiciary will not draw the best and the brightest, lifetime tenure
notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has argued that the
Sept. 11 terrorism and its aftermath, including the anthrax spores
that drove senators out of their offices, slowed the confirmation
pace. Moreover, when Bush decided to replace the American Bar Assn.'s
independent quality check of nominees with vetting by the
conservative Federalist Society, the Senate wisely beefed up its own
credentials review, which took time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats have refused to schedule hearings on Bush's most
controversial picks, including some with archconservative views on
civil rights and church-state separation. Which leads to a piece of
wisdom the senators' mothers should have taught them:</TE>
<TE>   2. Two wrongs don't make a right. Fact is, the Senate has a
constitutional obligation to offer advice and consent on presidential
nominations. If senators have objections to some of Bush's nominees
they should have the courage to put the nominations up for vote and
then vote "no."</TE>
<TE>   To simply delay is unfair to the nominees, whose lives are put on
hold and whose records are microscopically criticized. It's unfair to
sitting judges who have to shoulder the extra workload because of
vacancies, and, mostly, it's unfair to Americans with business before
the federal courts or just a stake in an independent, high-minded
judiciary.</TE>

<LD>The Vatican announced new guidelines this month on how it will use
ecclesiastical courts to try priests accused of sexually abusing
minors. The new policy--written, tellingly, in Latin and with little
detail revealed--was quietly published in the Holy See's official
gazette. Church officials view the new rules as a way to more
effectively deal with allegations of pedophilia against priests. But
the internal policy could stymie criminal investigations.</LD>
<LD>   Charges of child molestation or similar abuse are the business of
criminal investigators, to be adjudicated in a courtroom. Under
California law, members of the clergy have the obligation to report
to civil authorities cases where there is reasonable suspicion of a
crime, such as child abuse, except when the revelation occurs during
confession. The church says internal proceedings would not preclude
civil or criminal prosecutions of priests. The proceedings could,
however, cause irreparable damage to a case by "contaminating"
witnesses and evidence.</LD>
<LD>   An anonymous Vatican source quoted in media reports explained the
new policy by citing what he termed the church's pastoral obligation
to protect the rights of the accused. Indeed, men of the cloth, like
anyone else, must be assumed innocent until proven guilty--as the
devastating false accusations leveled against Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago in 1993 made clear.</LD>
<TE>   However, any institution's first obligation is to protect the
children with whom it has been entrusted. With that in mind, the
Vatican should follow its announcement of the new policy by giving
public assurance that before any internal steps are made, church
authorities will take specific precautions. The church should make
certain that every credible suspicion that a priest has molested a
minor is reported immediately to civil authorities. It should
cooperate with all law enforcement investigations and assign the
accused to duties that do not require contact with children until the
matter is settled. The church says its policy is to report and
cooperate, but it is not clear when authorities are to be notified.
Finally, priests found guilty by a secular court of law should
automatically be denied their clerical privileges and relieved of
duties.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt the church is sincere in pushing for reform. Keeping such
efforts secret would be a mistake. Secreta suspicionem
creant--secrets breed suspicion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "High Court Backs Agent Who Stopped Motorist," Jan. 16: The
Supreme Court's decision holding that in policing the drug war, cops
can stop drivers for such vague, ambiguous and common behavior as
slowing down when they see a police car, not making eye contact or
letting their children wave at a passing police car ought to be a
warning siren to all Americans that the war on drugs is having a
devastating impact on the rights and freedoms of everyone--not just
drug users.</LD>
<LD>   Whether or not you use marijuana, the court's ruling applies to
you.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th Amendment protection against unreasonable searches was
once a strong and respected constitutional right. Unfortunately for
all Americans the 4th Amendment is now all but a fairy tale, a
historical remnant of the time before politicians and Supreme Court
justices declared a "war on some drugs" and set out on a
slash-and-burn campaign without limits.</LD>
<TE>   Personally, I'd much rather live in a world where some people
smoke marijuana than in a police state.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Glen Boire</TE>
<TE>   Davis, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was thoroughly horrified to read that the Supreme Court voted
9-0 to allow the police to stop a vehicle on the grounds of any
"reasonable suspicion." Now the 4th Amendment means nothing. We are
at the mercy of every arbitrary whim of the police. I say it's better
that drug dealers get away than the innocent be subject to
"reasonable suspicion" searches.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what bothers me most is the 9-0 vote. Liberal Justices John
Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are traitors whose true agenda
differs not at all from that of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justice Clarence Thomas.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sept. 11 Fund's Fine Print Angers Many Relatives," Jan. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Although everyone in America is sorry for their loss, the families
of the victims who died on 9/11 need to quit being so materialistic
in regard to how much money they should receive. No amount of cash
will bring back their relatives or alleviate their pain--and to put
any price tag on those lives lost is a futile and distorted way of
dealing with grief.</LD>
<LD>   The families of those who died equally horrible deaths--in
Vietnam, Pearl Harbor or Oklahoma City, to name a few--did not
receive millions of dollars, and I think it is a very bad precedent
when our society says that you can only handle the death of a loved
one by becoming a millionaire.</LD>
<TE>   Sage Vanden Heuvel</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding your article on people litigating over unfair
compensation for losses on 9/11: Suppose that terrorists manage to
detonate a nuclear bomb or release a deadly biological agent in a
major U.S. city that kills, say, 500,000 people. Will we then be
treated to the spectacle of 500,000 families suing whatever entity
has the deepest pockets to obtain their "just compensation"?</TE>
<TE>   The fact that all this 9/11-related legal activity is going on now
is proof positive that we are not in a state of war, as has been
claimed. During a real war (think 1941) no one would be complaining
publicly about "not getting theirs." Thank heaven that things are not
at that point yet and that personal injury lawyers are busy as usual.</TE>

<HD>In the GOP, a Sit-Down, Stand-Up Debate</HD>

<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dithering over the shape of the table at the Vietnam War peace
talks seemed to drag on as long as the talks themselves. Tuesday
night's debate among the three GOP candidates for governor was
assuming those proportions:</LD>
<LD>   Do they stand (favored by tall candidates like Bill Jones)? Do
they sit (favored by Richard Riordan, who can be inclined to walk as
he talks)?</LD>
<LD>   The agreement: They will sit at the first debate, on Tuesday
night. They will stand for the second debate. And for the third, they
drew straws, and it'll be chairs all around. But considering the gobs
of money being spent on campaigns, lying down Roman-fashion and being
fed grapes is not outside the realm of reason. The next stumbling
block: Would those be union grapes, or nonunion grapes?</LD>
<TE>   In Condit's Saga, Ceres Is Both City and Symbol</TE>
<TE>   On the home-front hustings, the nation's cover-boy congressman,
Gary Condit, likes to identify himself as the local boy: "I'm Gary
Condit. I'm from Ceres."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Condit is the Democrat whose political career began 30 years
ago on the Ceres City Council; there's a chance it could end in this
year's election, where voters will hear yet again about his dicey
relationship with Chandra Levy.</TE>
<TE>   She was the young intern who disappeared from her Washington,
D.C., apartment and has been the object of a vast search led by her
grieving mother.</TE>
<TE>   And Ceres is a town of about 33,000 in California's Central
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Ceres is also the name of the ancient Romans' goddess of
agriculture. According to legend (which the Romans swiped from the
Greeks), Ceres' daughter was stolen into hell by the god of the
underworld. The girl's anguished mother roamed the world searching
for her child.</TE>
<TE>   In the myth, Ceres laid perpetual winter on the land until her
daughter was restored to her for part of the year, which is the way
the ancients explained fertile and fallow seasons. In life, Chandra
Levy has not yet been found, and her mother has organized a support
group of others with missing relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Money Makes a Face: Quackenbush's</TE>
<TE>   To commemorate a degree of cupidity rare even in politics, the
name and face of discredited former state Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush have been bestowed upon the "Quack-O-Meter," a
device to track the insurance industry's contributions to candidates
for Quackenbush's old job.</TE>
<TE>   Assembled by the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, the
Quack-O-Meter's mission works like this: The more moola a candidate
gets from insurance folks, the more of Quackenbush's mug is revealed.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-January, candidates Tom Umberg--for years Orange County's
only Democrat in Sacramento--and John Garamendi--who turned down some
insurance contributions a dozen years ago as the state's first
elected insurance commissioner--had zero dough from insurance
outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Democrat Tom Calderon has raised about half his money,
roughly $800,000, from insurance sources, so the watchdog group
filled his picture in about halfway.</TE>
<TE>   Political junkies will remember that Calderon's brother Charles, a
former state senator, got smacked with an $18,000 fine last month for
breaking clean-campaign laws; among other indulgences, he used
campaign money to rent a limo for the premiere of the movie "Liar,
Liar."</TE>
<TE>   Last word on the Quackster is that he and his wife are still in
Hawaii, where she is campaigning against the state's required one- to
four-month quarantine on dogs and cats coming over from the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Reardon's for Riordan, but Confusion Still Rules</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan gubernatorial campaign was taken to the woodshed in
this space for careless misspellings in its campaign
communications--verbs and proper names, including, shockingly, Nancy
"Reardon," as in the candidate's wife. Ah, but there IS a "Nancy
Reardon" in the Riordan camp, a Pasadena woman married to a man named
Chuck, not a Brentwood woman married to a man named Dick.</TE>
<TE>   But the same week this news was conveyed, so too was a press
release referring to Riordan's taking part in a "distinguised speaker
series" at the Richard Nixon Library, which had to correct its own
gaffe, noting that it would be Bill SIMON, not Bill JONES, speaking
at the library.</TE>
<TE>   On the Move With Pelosi and Other Californians</TE>
<TE>   On her first day as the House of Representatives' minority whip,
Nancy Pelosi was 3,000 miles away from the House floor, in her San
Francisco field office.</TE>
<TE>   Her staff was spiffing up the old whip's third-floor Capitol
suite. Pelosi's boss, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and the
Republican who cracks the whip on the entire House of
Representatives, Speaker Dennis Hastert, were cooking up a formal
ceremony for her for Feb. 6 in Statuary Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The whip job--counting heads and keeping the Democratic ranks
together--makes Pelosi the highest-ranking woman in the history of
Congress. She debuted her new title on Thursday, speaking to the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League's annual
dinner marking the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision
legalizing abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her fellow Californians, the ones with the R behind their
names, were nudging their own way to power. Three would like to
replace a Utah Republican as head of the House Resources Committee,
ground zero for debates on environmentalism and property rights.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, all three of them--Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley, Ken
Calvert of Riverside and Richard Pombo of Tracy--are on the
conservative end of the land-use argument, while a senior committee
member who wants the job, New Jersey's H. James Saxton, is more
sympathetic to environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Pombo (whose name means "pigeon" in Portuguese) once published a
book arguing for private property rights, using as its title "This
Land Is Our Land," a pinch and a twist on Woody Guthrie's song, which
takes rather a different stand.</TE>
<TE>   A Supervisor Confesses His Political Polygamy</TE>
<TE>   He's spent a quarter-century and then some on the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors, but the work still gets him giddy. After John
Flynn's colleagues chose him as board chairman for 2002, his
thank-you speech got a little out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   First, as his executive aide Elizabeth Montijo hauled his
paperwork to his new front-and-center seat, the thoroughly married
Flynn gabbled, "Elizabeth is like a second wife to me." The audience
tittered.</TE>
<TE>   "Please don't print that," he implored reporters. "My wife has
been looking for an excuse to leave me for a long time." The crowd
laughed again at that, and Flynn took one more cut.</TE>
<TE>   Looking toward the clergyman who had given the morning's
invocation, he added, "That's why I invited the priest here today."</TE>
<TE>   Who's for Whom</TE>
<TE>   Some recent endorsements:</TE>
<TE>   * Gray Davis: Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the
California Labor Federation and the California Faculty Assn.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Jones: MAPA, the Mexican American Political Assn.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Riordan: Lincoln Club of Northern California</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Simon: COPS, the California Organization of Police and
Sheriffs</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Not the best advance work was in evidence when Bill Jones' aides
set up a podium in front of a Culver City liquor-grocery store to
hold a news conference about lottery troubles, without anyone having
informed the grocery store owners about it.</TE>
<TE>   * When the chronically late Gray Davis was tardy for a
school-testing news conference at a Sacramento elementary school, an
aide vamped for time by leading the children in a game of "Simon
Says," as in "Simon says, I can't wait to see the governor," to which
the kids responded, "Simon says, I hope he gets here soon," which for
Davis, he did--only half an hour late.</TE>
<TE>   * John Stites, a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant running
against his boss, Lee Baca, headlined a news release faulting Baca
for not showing up at a candidates' debate, "What is the difference
between scandal-plagued Gary Condit and scandal-plagued Lee Baca? At
least Gary Condit honors the voters by attending debates."</TE>
<TE>   * The Rev. Lou Sheldon, an Orange County uber-conservative, showed
up at a Bill Simon-Rudy Giuliani fund-raiser, where he was asked
about shelling out $1,000 to see a former mayor who supports abortion
rights, left his wife during an affair and moved in with a gay
couple. Said Sheldon, "The issue in California is infrastructure,
it's electricity, it's water."</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo was named "New Democrat
of the Week"--yes, week--by the national Democratic Leadership
Council.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Conrad, a GOP candidate for Condit's congressional seat,
sent out an e-mail telling supporters to vote for him in a newspaper
Web site poll, the "Merced Sun-Star pole."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "He was a switch-hitter; I mean that in the best sense. I know it
can have several different meanings."</TE>
<TE>   --Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was asked whether
Bill Simon handled mostly civil or criminal cases when he worked for
Giuliani in the U.S. attorney's office in New York in the 1980s.
Giuliani was in California stumping for Simon.</TE>

<HD>The King Holiday Isn't Just for Blacks</HD>

<LD>The Board of Commissioners of North Carolina's Davidson County
briefly was the center of national attention recently when its
members reversed themselves and narrowly voted to recognize the
Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday. The commissioners claimed
that they previously did not celebrate the holiday because they could
not afford to give county workers another day off.</LD>
<LD>   They may have snubbed the King holiday for decades because of
parsimony, or maybe just plain racism, but they were hardly alone in
ignoring King.</LD>
<LD>   When President Reagan in 1983 grudgingly signed the law that made
King's birthday a national holiday, civil rights leaders hoped that
all Americans would permanently honor King's accomplishments.</LD>
<TE>   It was wishful thinking. Millions of Americans and most businesses
still refuse to celebrate the day. Surveys show that a dismally small
number of businesses give their workers a day off with pay, and that
number has shrunk each year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the King holiday is not shunned solely out of cost, greed,
ignorance or racism. It is ignored because of the fiction that King
was solely a black leader, that the civil rights movement was a
movement only for blacks and that his holiday should be celebrated
exclusively by blacks.</TE>
<TE>   When King formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in
1957, he staked out the moral high ground for the modern-day civil
rights movement. He made it possible, even obligatory, for most white
Americans to condemn racial segregation as immoral and legally
indefensible.</TE>
<TE>   King's "moral imperative" quickly stretched far past the limits of
the civil rights movement. The leaders of the gay and women's rights
movements were motivated by King's actions and borrowed heavily from
the tactics of the civil rights movement. Cesar Chavez, who now has
his own California holiday, repeatedly praised King and other civil
rights leaders for encouraging and providing aid to the farm-worker
and labor organizing battles.</TE>
<TE>   The civil rights movement also had a major effect on other world
struggles. It inspired activist priests in Latin America, students
demonstrating against injustice in Europe and the oppressed in South
Africa fighting against apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   King was the first major protest leader to condemn the Vietnam War
and American militarism. He gave impetus and credibility to the
antiwar movement. Even today, opponents of President Bush's Afghan
bombing campaign quickly latched on to King's speeches on the Vietnam
War. They claim that if King were alive, he would vigorously denounce
the bombing and Bush's anti-terrorist policies.</TE>
<TE>   King almost certainly would have spoken out against the bombing,
but he would not have rationalized or justified terrorist acts, as
some have, as a legitimate response to U.S. policy by aggrieved
Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   King's moral vision and reach extended far beyond questions of
war, peace and racial injustice. He saw that true democracy could
never be realized without economic justice for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   He pounded away on the need to end class oppression and poverty.
His Poor People's March in 1968 was a flawed but sincere effort to
bring the poor of all races together to seek economic justice.</TE>
<TE>   The civil rights movement, increased civil liberties protections
and expanded universal voting rights together produced a vast array
of legal, social and educational programs that permanently
transformed American society and enriched the lives of Americans of
all races and income groups, not just blacks. The millions of
Americans who shun the King holiday would do well to remember that.</TE>

<HD>Keep U.S. Nuclear Testing on the Back Burner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD>Michael O'Hanlon studied nuclear weapons issues at the
Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1994. He is now a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, the Bush administration released the findings of
its so-called nuclear weapons posture review. The plan has many good
elements. For example, it proposes cutting the deployed force of
long-range U.S. nuclear arms to about 2,000 warheads--one-third the
current level.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton administration aspired to make similar cuts but was
impeded by congressional resistance and the long, slow process of
formal arms control with Moscow. President Bush wisely is willing to
make the cuts unilaterally and less formally, knowing that Russia
would surely follow down the path of deep cuts, given its economic
problems.</LD>
<LD>   But there are elements of the weapons review that are less
desirable. High on the list is the administration's stance on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was signed by the Clinton
administration but never approved by Congress. The Bush
administration has no interest in ratifying it.</LD>
<TE>   While it has no immediate intention to resume nuclear weapons
tests, the administration believes such tests may someday be needed,
either to ensure the reliability of the U.S. arsenal or to develop
new types of warheads. As a result, it wants to upgrade the readiness
of the Nevada nuclear test site.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it would take two to three years to prepare a test that
abided by environmental and health regulations. The administration
appears intent on cutting that time roughly by half.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, such enhanced readiness may seem reasonable. What
could be wrong, one might ask, with having a backup plan in case we
discover serious problems in the existing nuclear arsenal and need to
verify that a possible fix would work?The problem is that with each
step toward renewed nuclear testing, the United States inches further
away from supporting a treaty that it did much to create and that
would serve its interests well.</TE>
<TE>   Other nations stand to gain much more from future nuclear tests
than we do. A country trying to develop nuclear weapons for the first
time almost surely would need to test to develop a relatively
lightweight warhead suitable for placement atop a ballistic missile.</TE>
<TE>   Simpler warheads, akin to our ''fat man'' and ''little boy'' bombs
dropped on Japan, might not require testing, but they would probably
be so heavy that they would have to be delivered by truck or
airplane. That would give us a chance to intercept them.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping other countries from developing advanced warheads should
be a goal for the United States. It is true that other countries
still could test nuclear weapons even if the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty had been ratified by the U.S. and other major powers. But
Washington would have a much easier time punishing violators with
economic sanctions--or even justifying the use of military force
against their nuclear facilities in extreme cases.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. simply does not need testing to ensure the reliability of
a strong nuclear deterrent. Many bomb designers would disagree with
that statement, saying that as warheads age, they can deteriorate and
fail in ways our computer models and other simulation techniques
might not predict. Many of them argue that only actual nuclear
testing can really ascertain the reliability of the arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   But why do we have to let our warheads age? Following an idea
promoted by Richard Garwin, one of the fathers of the hydrogen bomb,
we could simply rebuild a fraction of our arsenal every year.</TE>
<TE>   Doing this would necessitate using old-fashioned materials and
techniques. It would be important to keep making the high explosives
and the plutonium "pits" in nuclear warheads the same way they have
always been made. We could not modernize the way we make nuclear
warheads in the interest of modestly reducing environmental
contamination or improving convenience.</TE>
<TE>   So be it. Preserving the reliability of our nuclear deterrent
without actual warhead testing is more important. In addition, the
U.S. could also introduce a new, simpler type of bomb into its
inventory that would be sure to work even if it deteriorated
partially.</TE>
<TE>   There is admittedly one difficult issue. What if, to attack an
enemy's deep underground bunkers or weapons production sites, the
U.S. wanted a new type of nuclear bomb capable of penetrating many
dozens of meters of rock before detonating? Such a new capability
might well require testing.</TE>
<TE>   But this argument is not compelling since the benefit of making it
harder for countries like Iraq and North Korea to develop nuclear
arms far outweighs any likely benefit of such a warhead, at least at
present.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the international moratorium on nuclear testing is
generally holding, and we should keep it that way. Taking the first
step toward eroding it by readying a test site for nuclear weapons
tests is unnecessary to maintain the reliability of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal today, and unwise. Keep the Nevada test site, but in a state
of cold, long-term storage.</TE>

<HD>Evolution's Pregnant Pause: Artificial Wombs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY RIFKIN</AU>
<BD>Jeremy Rifkin, who is the author of "The Biotech
Century" (Tarcher Putnam, 1998), is the president of the Foundation
on Economic Trends in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The womb is a dark and dangerous place, a hazardous environment,"
the late Joseph Fletcher, professor of medical ethics at the
University of Virginia School of Medicine, wrote 25 years ago. "We
would want our potential children to be where they can be watched and
protected as much as possible," Fletcher said.</LD>
<LD>   These words came back to me in recent weeks with talk of the
prospect of cloning a human being and of using embryonic stem cells
to create specific body parts to cure or alleviate diseases.</LD>
<LD>   But another biological bombshell is waiting in the wings, one that
would forever change our concept of human life: the possibility of an
artificial womb so that, theoretically, tomorrow's babies could be
grown in laboratories.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the prospect of an artificial womb raises troubling questions.
One example: We know that the developing fetus responds to the
mother's heartbeat, emotions, moods and movements. What kind of child
would we produce from a liquid medium inside a plastic box? Do we
risk producing beings who are unable to emotionally connect and be
fully human?</TE>
<TE>   These and other important practical, moral and ethical questions
must be addressed before we let science move ahead willy-nilly.
However, there may be no way to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, a team of Cornell University scientists
announced that it had succeeded in creating an artificial womb lining
using a cocktail of drugs and hormones.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the research, led by Dr. Hung Chiung Liu of the Center
for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, is to help infertile
couples by creating an entire womb that could be transplanted into a
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway around the world, working in a small research laboratory
at Juntendou University in Tokyo, Yosinori Kuwabara and his
colleagues are developing the first operational artificial womb--a
clear plastic tank the size of a bread basket filled with
body-temperature amniotic fluid.</TE>
<TE>   For the past several years, Kuwabara and his team have kept goat
fetuses growing for up to 10 days in this womb by connecting the
goats' umbilical cords to machines that serve as a placenta, pumping
in blood, oxygen and nutrients and disposing waste products.</TE>
<TE>   While the plastic womb is still only in development, Kuwabara
predicts that a fully functioning artificial womb capable of
gestating a human fetus may be a reality in less than six years.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists say we will probably see the mass use of
artificial wombs by the time today's babies become parents.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial wombs will likely first be used in cases where either
the mother can no longer carry the child or where the fetus needs to
be cared for in an environment where it can be easily monitored.</TE>
<TE>   We already can keep fetuses alive in incubators during the last
three months of gestation. And researchers routinely fertilize eggs
and keep embryos alive in vitro for three to four days before
implanting them in a woman's womb.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists such as Kuwabara are attempting to fill in the time
between the beginning and end of the gestation process--the critical
period during which the fetus develops most of its organs.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, being able to grow a fetus in a totally artificial
womb would make it easier to make genetic corrections and
modifications, thus creating "designer babies."</TE>
<TE>   The artificial womb could even become the preferred means of
producing a child. Young women could have their eggs removed when the
eggs are most viable.</TE>
<TE>   Ditto for men's sperm. Parenthood would thus become an option at
any time using petri dishes and artificial wombs.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers could thus spare themselves the rigors and inconveniences
of pregnancy and bring their babies home when "done."</TE>
<TE>   Farfetched? Thousands of surrogate mothers' wombs already have
been used to gestate someone else's fertilized embryos. The
artificial womb seems the next logical step in a process that has
increasingly removed reproduction from traditional maternity and made
of it a laboratory-conceived, commercial process.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," in which the "normal"
people were genetically designed, cloned and gestated in artificial
wombs--a biological assembly line process churning out ideal
genotypes?</TE>
<TE>   In Huxley's book, Mustapha Mond, one of the 10 world "controllers"
of this utopian civilization, asks his young proteges to try to
imagine "what it was like to have a viviparous mother"--one who bears
a fetus in her own womb. Only the savages living in the remote
reservations far away from civilized life still carried their own
babies and breast-fed them after birth. The practice was considered
something only animals did.</TE>
<TE>   When Huxley wrote his novel in 1932, the contraceptive pill had
not yet arrived on the scene. The pill revolutionized sex, removing
it from the process of reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, egg donation,
surrogacy and, soon, cloning are further separating the components of
reproduction from the biological act of mating. The artificial womb
completes the process.</TE>
<TE>   Supposing there is an end to human pregnancy, how would that
affect the concept of parental responsibility? Would parents feel
less attached to their offspring and come to think of a baby more as
an object and less of an extension of their being? Would there still
be a sense of generational continuity that is so essential for
maintaining historical continuity and civilized life?</TE>
<TE>   How would the end of pregnancy affect the way we think about
gender and the role of women?</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, the feminist writer Shulamith Firestone wrote
enthusiastically about the prospect of an artificial womb: "Pregnancy
is the temporary deformation of the body of the individual for the
sake of the species. Moreover, childbirth hurts and isn't good for
you. At the very least, development of an option should make possible
an honest examination of the ancient value of motherhood."</TE>
<TE>   Other feminists view the artificial womb as the final
marginalization of women, robbing them of their primary role as
progenitor of the species. The artificial womb, they argue, becomes
the quintessential expression of male dominance, a mechanical
substitute for the female womb honed to engineering standards and
quality controls.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the artificial womb, asexual cloning technology and
stem cells to produce all the extra body parts they need, men could
free themselves, once and for all, from their dependency on women.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this comes to be or not, the artificial womb represents
the completion of an even longer historic process that began nearly
400 years ago at the dawn of the Scientific Age.</TE>
<TE>   It was Francis Bacon, the father of modern science, who referred
to Mother Nature as "a common harlot." He urged future generations to
"tame," "squeeze," "mold" and "shape" her so that "man could become
her master and the undisputed sovereign of the physical world."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt some people will see the artificial womb as the final
triumph of modern science. Others, the ultimate human folly.</TE>
<TE>   Some take comfort in the fact that the artificial womb is far off
on the horizon. Five years ago, we thought the same thing about human
cloning and using stem cells to produce body parts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Colombia Leader Rejects Rebels' Peace Proposal," Jan. 13: Sadly,
things seem to be getting back to business as usual. Once again, we
Americans are retreating into blissful ignorance of world events.</LD>
<LD>   Lost in the increasingly loud partisan bickering over the latest
Washington scandal came disturbing news that Colombia came to the
brink of all-out civil war. Why should we care? Because the
democratic pro-American government in Colombia finds itself in a
violent and destabilizing war with three insurgent groups, all of
which are on the U.S. list of international terrorist organizations.</LD>
<LD>   How does this affect us? These groups are nothing but glorified
security guards for Colombia's enormous cocaine and heroin production
fields. Most of these drugs find their way into the United States,
killing far more people every year than the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Haven't we learned the lesson that events in a land far away
involving terrorist organizations do indeed have an impact on us?
What will it take for Americans to pay attention to this ticking time
bomb?</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Talib Is Charged With Conspiracy," Jan. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Let's be honest here. John Walker Lindh was looking for religion,
not to pick a fight or kill American citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Treason? Please. Lindh was simply defending his right to practice
his own religion against invading soldiers who shackled the Taliban's
religion to Osama bin Laden as one dragon with two heads.</LD>
<TE>   What a joke! If anyone needs to be tried it's Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft for trashing his oath and Constitution once again--in my
opinion--with these bogus charges against Lindh's free exercise of
his religion.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan R. Chase</TE>
<TE>   San Ramon, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Ashcroft that "youth is not absolution for
treachery." If Lindh's supporters persuade any jury to dismiss his
actions because he is a "misguided youth who was tragically
brainwashed," then the American justice system will need to apologize
to every juvenile gang member charged as an adult for murder.</TE>

<TE>   Ashcroft tells us that youth is not absolution for treachery. No,
but wealth is. I will believe his pious rhetoric when the Justice
Department pursues Enron's Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling with the
same vigor that it pursues Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   As to who is more guilty of treachery, ask the former employees of
Enron who lost their retirement.</TE>

<HD>Problem of Urban Noise Is Loud and Clear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a homeowner residing directly adjacent to a major freeway
interchange that serves as a junction for FAA-mandated flight
corridors for general aviation, my neighbors and I are unavoidably
aware of the noise generated by ever-increasing helicopter
overflights.</LD>
<LD>   "Gotta Go! The Chase Is On!" (Jan. 15) served to illustrate the
often crassly commercial motives for increased helicopter activity
above residential areas 24/7. With the exception of police, fire and
search-and-rescue teams, a reduction in other helicopter traffic
would benefit, not degrade, the quality of life below,
notwithstanding media mantras about the public's right to know.
During the brief, quieter times resulting from security measures
enacted after Sept. 11, life on the ground in neighborhoods such as
mine was measurably less jarring. To reduce the swarm of media
helicopters, why can't official agencies such as the LAPD, the CHP
and Caltrans cover essential activities with their aircraft, pooling
news to the TV stations? Caltrans has roadbed sensors that relay
traffic flow data that could be transmitted to all the media for
traffic updates.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from the obvious dangers of police chases to those on the
ground and of collisions to those in the air followed by crashes
below, increasing findings by experts regarding the impact of urban
noise on health should be of much greater interest to lawmakers and
health and safety officials. Hopefully, in my lifetime.</TE>

<LD>Letter writer B. Meredith Burke would like us to believe that
continuance of the current immigration rate is a "frightening
prospect" (Jan. 16). This is based on the assertion that the current
U.S. population is nearly double the "maximum sustainable carrying
capacity level estimated by ecologists."</LD>
<LD>   I'm curious how Burke and these ecologists square this with the
reality that the air and water are much cleaner than they were 30
years ago, food and other resources are as plentiful as they have
ever been and our quality of life is second to none. All this in
spite of a growing population already well past what the estimate
said could be sustained.</LD>

<HD>Don't Limit Employees on 401(k) Investments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Corporate Pension Games," editorial, Jan. 17: You advocate
throwing the baby out with the bathwater regarding 401(k) plans
funded with company stock.</LD>
<LD>   What percentage of 401(k) plans containing company stock have gone
bankrupt like Enron's as opposed to those which have given their
employees the ability to garner a very large amount of net worth for
a corresponding meager investment on the employee's part? Most
401(k)s limit the amount that the employee can contribute to 6% to 8%
of his or her gross annual income. This is sheltered from payroll
taxes to the extent that the real out-of-pocket cost to employees is
about two-thirds of what they put in.</LD>
<LD>   Those who have worked for companies like Wal-Mart, Microsoft and
others have become financially comfortable to wealthy as a result of
investing in their company's stock. In retrospect, had this proposed
limitation been in effect they would have been restricted to 20% of
what they have today. Is that fair?</LD>
<TE>   There is a wealth of investment advice people can read, including
"Investing for Dummies." Indeed, most lay investors are warned about
putting all their eggs in one employer's basket, but the specter of
relying on Social Security's 2% return that you can't touch until age
62 today is ample incentive to invest in the company you work for if
it is doing well. The better thing for Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) to push for is long jail time for
white-collar crooks.</TE>

America was occurring through nearly unbridled power by big business.

<DL></DL>
<LD>We are in a recession. The lion's share of responsibility goes to
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He created a formula to hold
the economy on an even keel: raise interest rates when the economy is
getting too hot and lower interest rates when the economy is getting
too cold.</LD>
<LD>   Last year he set new records by lowering the prime rate 11 times,
trying desperately to avoid a recession. Of course, he failed because
his premise is wrong, and he's in the act of proving so at the
expense of millions who put their trust in him.</LD>
<LD>   Lowering the prime rate takes many billions of dollars out of the
hands of savers. A fatal maneuver. We need those dollars in
circulation. More than that, the lowering of interest rates brings on
a panic of its own by hint of recession.</LD>

<HD>Unions Support Artist Rights Bill</HD>
<DH>Labor: State legislation, opposed by record labels, would
in effect free musicians from lengthy contracts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four powerful labor organizations will enter the artist rights fray
this week, supporting state legislation that could open the door to
free agency for recording acts.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, leaders from the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists, the California Federation of Labor and
the Hollywood Entertainment Labor Council are expected to announce
their endorsement of a bill that would repeal an amendment in the
state labor code that, in effect, extends contracts for recording
acts longer than for other workers.</LD>
<LD>   The labor groups, which represent more than 4 million workers in
dozens of guilds and unions, intend to increase the pressure on
lawmakers during an "Artists Lobby Day" in Sacramento that will
include appearances by more than a dozen music stars--including
Courtney Love, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Don Henley and Carole King as well
as members of Los Lobos, Offspring and Matchbox Twenty and former
members of Rage Against the Machine.</LD>
<TE>   "This isn't just a rock-star issue anymore," said Sen. Kevin
Murray (D-Culver City), who recently introduced the legislation on
behalf of the artist community. "We've got pipe fitters and building
trade laborers and all kinds of unions coming out in support of this
battle as a workers issue now."</TE>
<TE>   Aligning itself with the Recording Artists Coalition, big labor is
preparing to square off against the Big Five music corporations:
France's Vivendi Universal, Japan's Sony Corp., Germany's
Bertelsmann, Britain's EMI Group and New York-based AOL Time Warner
Inc. The five global giants and their Washington-based lobbying arm,
the Recording Industry Assn. of America, adamantly oppose Murray's
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Top music executives already have contacted Gov. Gray Davis and
asked him to veto the legislation, contending that it would damage
the economy by forcing record companies to leave California--a threat
that could result in the loss of nearly 25,000 jobs and $1 billion in
wages.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the RIAA launched a campaign to kill Murray's bill,
unleashing its lobbying team in Sacramento and delivering packages of
information critical of the bill. The RIAA is warning legislators
that passage of the bill will force companies to stop signing
California-based artists, fire employees and restrict future
investments in new talent.</TE>
<TE>   "The increased financial risk from any such amendments may leave
record companies no choice but to decrease the number of new artists
they sign and promote," the RIAA said in a handout to lawmakers.
"Shortening the terms of California recording contracts or
restricting the availability of damages would jeopardize the
recording companies' ability to recover their investments and earn
profits from their contracts with successful California-based
artists."</TE>
<TE>   The statute that is the focus of Murray's bill was enacted in the
late 1890s but achieved prominence 50 years ago after a legal battle
by film star Olivia de Havilland to free actors from long-term studio
deals. De Havilland's court case allowed actors, for the first time,
to negotiate employment contracts based on their fair-market value.
Section 2855 sanctioned free agency for other California workers
performing service jobs, such as architects, commercial artists,
designers and recording acts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, the RIAA launched an effort to extend the statute to 10
years. When those efforts failed, the RIAA asked legislators to grant
music labels a "special exemption to the law"' and give them the
right to sue artists for damages resulting from undelivered albums.
Industry lobbyists contendedthat record companies make large
investments in an artist's career based on the promise that the act
would deliver a certain number of albums under the
contract--typically seven recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Artists put up little resistance to the amendment's passage in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   But the debate at that time failed to include the fact that labels
typically require successful acts to spend two years per project
touring and making videos and TV appearances to help boost sales. It
would take 14 years, artists say, for the average act to complete its
obligations under a standard agreement.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, music acts have launched their own trade group
and hired a team of lobbyists to pressure lawmakers to repeal the
amendment. With big labor on their side, the coalition says it is
prepared to take on the foreign-owned corporations that dominate the
record business and stop them from trying to dictate California labor
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Murray anticipates a bitter showdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Every worker in this state deserves a fair contract--artists
included," Murray said. "The foreign-owned music giants can threaten
to pack up and leave all they want. California is an artist-friendly
state."</TE>

<HD>Making a Splash at Olympics</HD>
<DH>Games: Universal City's Wet Design, noted for the Bellagio
fountains, is creator of the $2-million water-cooled caldron holding
the torch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 12-foot-tall glass caldron that will cradle the Olympic flame for
the duration of the Winter Games in Salt Lake City next month is the
brainchild of Universal City-based Wet Design, a firm whose portfolio
includes the operatic fountains at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The torch relay that has been touring the country will end when
the flame lights the $2-million caldron at the Feb. 8 opening
ceremony for the Games at University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Olympic
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Designer Tim Hunter said the caldron's angular design was inspired
by the jagged mountain peaks that surround the city. "There are no
right angles on this thing at all," Hunter said.</LD>
<TE>   Perched atop a 120-foot steel tower is the chalice that will hold
the flame. It is a hollow, inverted pyramid made from a glass-ceramic
hybrid that can withstand temperatures of up to 900 degrees
Fahrenheit. Water, the medium that is Wet's specialty, will run along
the inside of the caldron, cooling the transparent glass and
preventing soot buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, you'll be able to see the full fire
expression, rather than just the flame at the top edge" of the
caldron, said Mark Fuller, Wet's founder and chief executive. The
firm's design was chosen over three others, the Olympic organizing
committee said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1983, Wet has a team of about 90 designers, engineers
and support staff. Company sales last year totaled $12 million,
Fuller said. The company's best-known work is Bellagio's 8-acre lake,
which boasts choreographed 200-foot-high sprays of water powered by
compressed air.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has done work in Europe, Mexico, Asia and the Middle East
and is collaborating with architect I.M. Pei on new headquarters for
the International Monetary Fund in Washington. Locally, the firm has
created designs for Universal CityWalk, the Los Angeles Music Center
and the Gas Co. Tower.</TE>
<TE>   Wet's fountain designs range from the sophisticated to the simple,

<HD>Volkswagen Still Plans Expansion for Mexico Facility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>After threatening to cut its investment in Mexico after losing a
bitter labor dispute last summer, Volkswagen has decided to proceed
with expansion plans at its Puebla complex.</LD>
<LD>   The German auto maker is continuing with a $1-billion, five-year
plan to bolster its only North American manufacturing facility,
despite having said in September that its enthusiasm for Mexico had
dimmed after a 19-day strike that shuttered operations and a
subsequent 14.7% increase in wages and benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The company said then that it would consider redirecting
investment funds to Eastern Europe or Brazil. But VW's reaffirmation
of Mexico highlights its importance to the German giant. By contrast,
VW recently said it will reduce investment in its Brazilian
operations by $250 million from 2001's level.</LD>
<TE>   Production at Volkswagen's Puebla facility fell 10% last year to
380,000 units. VW's output was hurt by the strike and by its
declining market share in the Mexican car market. Since the start of
the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, General Motors and
Nissan have made significant inroads in a market once dominated by
Volkswagen.</TE>
<TE>   Cars and trucks made in Mexico last year totaled 1,817,807 units,
off 3.8% from 2000. About three-quarters of all Mexican-built
vehicles are exported. Mexican domestic sales, meanwhile,  rose 7.6%
to 918,835 units.</TE>
<TE>   VW hasn't wavered in its plan to produce a convertible model of
the popular New Beetle by mid-2002.</TE>

<HD>Group Faults Oversight of State Development Funds</HD>
<DH>Economy:  Researchers' report calls for a unified strategy
by agencies involved. It says there has been little effort to gauge
results of $39 billion spent since mid-1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California has spent more than $39 billion on economic development
since the mid-1990s but with little oversight and scant attention
paid to measuring outcomes, according to a report from a nonprofit
research group.</LD>
<LD>   In a 124-page document planned for release today, the California
Budget Project asserts that "California's current structure of
economic development spending is fragmented and lacks a systemic
review and evaluation process."</LD>
<LD>   Without such a system, the group says, "it is difficult, if not
impossible, to determine whether the $7.8 billion devoted to economic
development in 2000-01, or even the total $39.3 billion since
1995-96, has had a measurable impact on the vitality of the state's
economy."</LD>
<TE>   The report calls for the creation  of a "unified economic
development strategy" and a rethinking of the current practice of
spending more than half the development dollars on general business
support, instead of specific, targeted initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   One key problem is that 70% to 80% of the state's economic
development spending comes in the form of tax credits or other tax
incentives. For instance, manufacturers can receive credit for making
improvements to their plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Those, with very, very few exceptions, have absolutely no
evaluation or outcome measurements,"  said Hilary McLean Jean Ross,
executive director of the California Budget Project, adding that the
group based its conclusions on reading the laws that enabled such tax
incentives and from talking with state officials.</TE>
<TE>   "[A business] files a tax return and claims a credit," Ross said.
"The only force of law there is, is that you may get audited."</TE>
<TE>   The report did not identify specific problem programs, and the
spending tallies cited did not include economic development funds
from bonds, federal or local dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Gov. Gray Davis agrees that more accountability is
needed in one area--job creation and training.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' recently released budget proposal, Ross said, includes
steps designed to "improve access and accountability, eliminate
program duplication and achieve cost efficiencies" in work-force
development. The report also recommends a "systemic review" of
programs funded through tax incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said slightly more than half the programs funded by specific
budget appropriations receive a formal evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   The report states that California's non-tax-related economic
development spending is "scattered across more than two dozen
departments, agencies, boards, commissions and authorities."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no point where all of these people sit down and say,
'What's the most important economic goal for California and how do we
marshal our resources to get there?'" Ross said. "Right now, we have
programs with very similar functions, and there's very little
evidence that they communicate."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said the goal of the report, timed to precede the start of
budget deliberations, is not to "create a gigantic bureaucracy."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, she said, "it's to get all the little bureaucracies to
communicate."</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's important to make sure that the system works
together," she added. "Otherwise, you run the risk of having programs
that are at cross-purposes to one another. Or you have potentially
duplicative efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Especially now, when the state is facing a budget deficit, Ross
said, "we ought to know where those [economic development] dollars
are going and what the state is getting for those dollars."</TE>
<TE>   "Now we need to tighten the state's belt and make sure that we are
funding programs that work."</TE>
<TE>   The report states that only about 16% of economic development
funds appropriated through the budget are administered by the state's
Department of Technology, Trade and Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Williams, a department spokesman, disagreed with the notion
that the department's programs are not reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who will judge whether the efforts are effective are
the taxpayers and the Legislature," said Williams, noting the
economic and job expansion that has occurred since Davis took office.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at our track record--930,000 more jobs created under
Gov. Davis; we're now the fifth-largest economy in the
world--obviously our economic development efforts are working."</TE>

<DH>Courts: Leonard I. Green's divorce, lawsuit papers reveal
an old SEC charge, IRS audit and partnership strife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If written as a libretto, the life of Leonard I. Green--the wealthy
impresario of corporate takeovers and chief executive of the Los
Angeles Opera--certainly would not be titled "The Merry
Multimillionaire."</LD>
<LD>   Recently, the 68-year-old founder and namesake of the West Coast's
biggest leveraged-buyout firm has endured trying times. He faced a
boardroom coup by his partners, is under Internal Revenue Service
scrutiny for a Cayman Islands tax shelter and is locked in an
excruciating divorce battle with his third wife that has exposed his
personal finances as well as the unvarnished dealings of a takeover
artist.</LD>
<LD>   He finds himself explaining an old federal insider-trading charge,
settled years ago, that has come to light with a more recent claim by
his estranged wife that he gave an improper stock tip to a friend.
The latest allegation is a fabrication by an estranged wife who has
"viciously spread hurtful, false rumors about Mr. Green," said his
Los Angeles attorney, Dale F. Kinsella.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Green expressed regret over his
personal and professional troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it didn't happen," he said. "I wish I didn't make hasty
decisions, particularly in my marriage, that I did. And so I'll pay
for it, then we'll go on--and should go on--and enjoy life."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Jude Green, 49, who also has been married three times,
declined to comment for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Green, considered a pioneer of the friendly takeover,
co-founded a New York investment house that specialized in leveraged
management-backed buyouts before forming Los Angeles-based Leonard
Green &amp; Partners in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, his firm has raised $1.8 billion in investment capital
through three funds, managing money for such blue-chip institutional
investors as the California Public Employees Retirement System, the
University of Texas Endowment, Citicorp and Wells Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   Eschewing highflying technology stocks, Green's firm delivered
annualized returns of 80% during most of the 1990s by picking
successful takeover targets from sleepers in unglamorous industries
such as retailing. Green estimated the funds' current returns at 40%
to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has built its reputation quietly. But the partnership has
been dragged into Green's divorce proceeding, which includes a
breach-of-contract suit by her and a $25-million defamation suit by
him.</TE>
<TE>   The cases, which have been merged into one proceeding before Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard E. Denner, fill dozens of files
at the downtown courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The court records, along with hundreds of pages of previously
undisclosed documents obtained by The Times, present a stark picture
of a financial house in turmoil, a respected financier under
government scrutiny and a high-society marriage on the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Green and his wife have fought over his private Gulfstream II jet,
use of the Aspen, Colo.-area vacation house, the ownership of two
paintings by John Singer Sargent and Marc Chagall and her monthly fur
and jewelry allowance.</TE>
<TE>   Records also show that the IRS is auditing Green's 1997 and 1998
returns in connection with a trust that claimed a nearly $20-million
loss as a result of trades in foreign bank stock through an offshore
company.</TE>
<TE>   They also lay bare the details of a boardroom struggle within
Green's own firm over his decision to invest $300 million of client
funds in the financially troubled Rite Aid drugstore chain despite
his partners' misgivings about the company's financial standing and a
potential conflict of interest involving Green.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute led to a succession agreement that restricted Green's
participation and share of the profit from the next investment fund.</TE>
<TE>   Green's business partners said they have since made peace with the
firm's namesake and want to stay out of his personal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Jude and Leonard are involved in a very acrimonious divorce,"
said partner Jonathan D. Sokoloff. "It's between the two of them and
it doesn't involve Leonard Green &amp; Partners."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for CalPERS, which has $250 million invested in
Green-managed funds, said its money managers remain confident in the
partners' abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever personal issues may be involved are not impacting the
performance ... of the firm," Patricia Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Differing Accounts of Their Courtship</TE>
<TE>   Green filed for divorce in June 2000 from Jude (pronounced Judy),
whom he met on an Aspen skiing trip in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Jude, a physical therapist from Michigan, caught his eye the day
before Thanksgiving in the lobby of the Little Nell Hotel, where she
worked part time in the jewelry store. They had dinner two nights
later; by the end of the year, Green had taken her to New York and
Hawaii and professed his love for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that experienced with women," Green said, adding that he
was vulnerable at the time because he was going through a divorce. "I
met this woman who seemed to be totally enthralled with me and had
two really nice children and I felt, 'Gee, it would be nice to have
that kind of family.'"</TE>
<TE>   In a court filing, attorneys for Jude Green put it differently:
"As with his business targets, Leonard Green instituted a 'takeover'
of Jude Green's life, pursuing her as he would any other corporate
acquisition."</TE>
<TE>   They married July 27, 1995--two days after Jude's divorce from her
second husband was final. Green gave her a 10-carat diamond ring that
cost $225,000. The couple held a second ceremony--a $250,000
black-tie reception at the Hotel Bel-Air--before jetting off to spend
a "very lavish week in Rome and Vatican City," court papers say. They
took golfing trips to Spain and attended operas in San Francisco; New
York; Milan, Italy; and St. Petersburg, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The Greens were most visible within the Los Angeles Opera. A
founding director, former president and now chairman and chief
executive of the organization, Leonard Green oversaw a doubling of
donations from $8.5 million in 1998 to a projected $17.7 million this
fiscal year. The Greens donated $200,000 in 1999 and more than $1
million for the 2000-01 season, court records show. In 1998, Leonard
Green helped recruit tenor Placido Domingo as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   Jude Green served as chairwoman of the 1998 Opening Night Gala.
She was involved in initial planning for a 2000 gala honoring Domingo
until her husband, citing their marital situation, removed her as
chairwoman, a court exhibit shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Since your letter indicates that you have declined to resign, I
must regretfully remove you from that position on this date," Green
wrote on L.A. Opera stationery in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Green was ordered to provide his wife prized seats
for opening night by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jane L.
Johnson, who initially handled the divorce case.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Divorcing Couple Battles Over Aircraft and Art</TE>
<TE>   The couple also fought in court over access to Green's jet, with
each side producing experts to hash over the aircraft's "historic
use"--even arguing over the meaning of that term. Johnson eventually
denied Jude Green access to the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Jude Green accused her husband of removing paintings by
Toulouse-Lautrec and $10,000 worth of Cuban cigars from their Bel-Air
home before he filed for divorce. He said the artworks were just
posters and that he had taken only about 40 cigars worth $20 each.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Green claimed in court that "Le Grand Cirque" by Chagall
and "The Rialto" by Sargent were his property because he bought the
paintings with $3.4 million of his own money. He balked at her
demands to pay $500,000 a month for spousal support, including an
$83,000 allowance for furs and jewelry. He argued that the $1.3
million in jewelry he gave her during the marriage was a token of
past affections and a "durable capital investment with lasting value,
not a daily living expense."</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Johnson sided with Leonard Green, ruling that Jude's
demands were a gross exaggeration and cutting her monthly support to
$63,873, minus reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   As part of one filing, Jude disclosed that the IRS was examining
the couple's 1997 joint return. Among the exhibits are the first few
pages of a March 1999 opinion from KPMG, Green's accounting firm,
sketching details of an offshore transaction involving the Neerg
Trust.</TE>
<TE>   Additional documents show that the government audit has been
expanded to include 1998. The IRS is examining the validity of a
$20-million capital loss realized by the trust through a complicated
redemption transaction undertaken days after the trust was formed
July 9, 1997. The revocable trust is controlled by Green. ("Neerg" is
"Green" spelled backward.)</TE>
<TE>   The transaction uses an apparent wrinkle in U.S. tax law that
allows the cost basis, or purchase price, of stock bought by a
foreign corporation to be reassigned to a related entity, according
to the KPMG opinion. When the second entity sells the stock, it can
deduct the proceeds from the transferred cost basis and claim a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Such a transfer is "not free from doubt and there are no
authorities which are directly on point," the KPMG opinion said. The
firm advised Green that he stood a "better than 50% chance" of
withstanding an IRS challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Robert S. Schriebman, a Rolling Hills Estates tax attorney who has
advised the U.S. Senate Finance Committee and written several books
on battling the IRS, reviewed the outlines of the transaction at the
request of The Times and pronounced it "phony."</TE>
<TE>   Schriebman said the transaction would have trouble withstanding
IRS scrutiny because it has no inherent economic effect other than to
avoid taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Green confirmed the IRS examination and said KPMG approached him
"and about 100 other people" with the investment strategy. He said he
did not remember the details or the size of the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been audited before and come out pretty clean on most of my
returns, so I'm not concerned about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Court filings and depositions in the divorce proceeding also
reveal that Green was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for alleged insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC accused Green, then a partner of a New York-based
investment group, of buying 700 shares of a trucking company in March
1974--months before it was to be acquired by the group for a higher
stock price. The agency's civil complaint, filed in 1976, alleged
that Green bought the stock while "in possession of material,
non-public information."</TE>
<TE>   Without admitting guilt, Green signed a 1977 stipulation
forfeiting his $3,613 profit and prohibiting him from "purchasing,
selling, recommending or inducing the purchase or sale" of securities
based on inside information.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he was unjustly accused, since at the time he bought
the stock the takeover appeared unlikely. "If I had the money to
fight it at the time, I would have," he said, calling it a "very
disturbing experience."</TE>
<TE>   Jude Green is claiming that her husband engaged in insider-trading
activity involving Thrifty Payless and Rite Aid drugstores, one of
his firm's biggest success stories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Green's firm paid $40million for Thrifty Drugs. It then
merged Thrifty with Payless Drugs, which it acquired in 1994 for $1.2
billion. The privately held combination created the largest drugstore
chain in the Western U.S. with more than 1,080 outlets.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1996, Thrifty Payless went public; six months later it
was sold to Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid for $2.3 billion. The
transaction netted investors at Green's firm, which had a controlling
interest in Thrifty Payless, a total of $420 million in equity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green's Suit Claims Wife Defamed Him</TE>
<TE>   In the defamation suit against his wife, Green contends that her
insider-trading allegation damaged his reputation and harmed business
relations with his partners. It also added pressure to sign a
succession agreement that cut him out of future investor funds, Green
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Green himself who warned his partners in September 2000
that he expected his wife to make an accusation about insider trading
during the divorce, depositions in the defamation case show. The
partners concluded that the claim was untrue after two associates
interviewed Jude Green in her Bel-Air home and checked trading
records, depositions show.</TE>
<TE>   But the episode further deteriorated relations between Green and
his younger associates. They already were pressuring him to step down
over his decision to sink $300million of investor funds into a Rite
Aid investment in late 1999, when the drugstore was teetering and its
bankers were unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rite Aid was having a financial crisis similar, for example, to
what's going on today with Enron," partner Peter Nolan testified in a
November deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he was on a weekend golfing trip in Southampton, N.Y.,
in late 1999 when he received an emergency phone call from a Rite Aid
executive saying that bank loans were due and the chain needed more
equity. Green began working with the firm to provide a $300-million
infusion of money through the purchase of preferred stock.</TE>
<TE>   Amid pressure from Rite Aid executives to make an immediate
announcement of the investment, Green discussed the financing plan
with his partners during a telephone call to Los Angeles the next
Monday, depositions show. The partners protested.</TE>
<TE>   "I voiced a concern about the company's numbers and its financial
performance, and ... about the speed at which we were making the
investment," Nolan testified. He had another worry: whether Green had
a personal conflict of interest because he owned 1 million shares of
Rite Aid in a trust.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone's out making an investment decision in a company,
that's a factor that needs to be vetted, which we did not vet," Nolan
testified.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone exchange became heated and Green hung up, according
to depositions.</TE>
<TE>   "Leonard basically terminated the discussions and signed a
commitment letter," testified partner John G. Danhakl.</TE>
<TE>   As his percentage of the partnership fee, Green earned a $460,500
payment for placing the Rite Aid investment, court filings show. He
said he did not recall a discussion about a conflict of interest and
pointed out that all the partners owned shares in Rite Aid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid Management Shakeup, SEC Probe</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the decision, news broke about trouble with the
company's books, a discovery that prompted an SEC investigation. Rite
Aid management was thrown out and Green was briefly appointed
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The financier, who retains a seat on the board, said he
understands that the SEC probe is continuing. An SEC spokesman
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The acrimony within Green's firm continued to escalate.</TE>
<TE>   "As the stock dropped and as the problems became more apparent,
and as we started getting more heat from our investors, the tension
among the partners increased," Danhakl testified.</TE>
<TE>   The flashpoint came in early 2000, when Green called a meeting to
discuss his partners' unhappiness with the investment. Green recalled
the session as a "frank discussion about the investment and the way
the partnership should conduct itself relative to communication with
the outside world."</TE>
<TE>   In depositions, his partners characterized the meeting as a
tongue-lashing that persuaded them it was time for Green to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we wanted him out of there," testified Danhakl, who later
confronted Green and asked him to step down. Green said he refused
because the request was inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   But the clash ratcheted up pressure within the firm to negotiate a
succession agreement with Green, who was in his mid-60s and publicly
acknowledged taking a lesser role in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The talks eventually involved two advisors to CalPERS, who acted
on their own to quiet dissension between Green and the partners, some
of whom had stopped talking to the firm's founder.</TE>
<TE>   The CalPERS advisors "said that the investment community ... knew
of the problems within the partnership, which included the
insider-trading accusation," Green testified in a deposition. He
added that the advisors believed that the firm's "ability to raise a
new fund would be in question unless something was put to bed."</TE>
<TE>   Final terms were hammered out during the firm's 2000 Christmas
party, held in its Westwood offices. The agreement eliminates Green's
standing 30% partnership share for the next investor fund, and
instead pays him a flat $1.5 million a year for the next six years--a
change he has said will cost him millions.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also restricts Green's participation in the fund and
contains a noncompete clause, copies show.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want this to happen," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   The partners say Jude Green's accusations had nothing to do with
their decision to press for the succession agreement. Leonard Green
is demanding that the terms be renegotiated, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the value of the firm's Rite Aid investment has
fluctuated.</TE>
<TE>   When the succession agreement was finalized, the stock value fell
below the $300 million invested. When the depositions were taken two
months ago, it was nearly double. Today, Green estimates it is even
or slightly above. His partners declined to give a more precise
number, just that it represents a "meaningful profit."</TE>
<TE>   The drugstore chain, which has seen nearly four years of losses,
has since declared a $112-million loss for its fiscal third quarter
ending Dec. 1--prompting two rating services this month to downgrade
the stock, which tumbled on the news.</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid shares fell 36 cents Friday to close at $2.15 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Calls Wife's Claim of Insider Trading a Lie</TE>
<TE>   The insider-trading claim by Jude Green is detailed in sworn
depositions.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that her husband told her in October 1995 that he
met with Rite Aid CEO Martin L. Grass, who was going to make an offer
to buy Thrifty Payless. He cautioned her not to breathe a word to
anyone--even her mother, she testified.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, Jude said, she was shocked when Green allegedly
disclosed the merger plans to ski instructor Boone Schweitzer as the
three of them rode a ski lift in Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   She said the subject came up again in 1998 when another mutual
friend, Marianne Buchholz, divulged during a dinner party that she
had made considerable money from 100,000 shares of Thrifty Payless
stock she bought with Schweitzer, based on Green's "red-hot tip" that
the company would be acquired by Rite Aid.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Glazer, Jude Green's attorney, said her client's account
is accurate and declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Green said his wife is peddling a "total, absolute lie" in
the court papers.</TE>
<TE>   "She took all of these individual facts ... and said, 'I'm going
to make up this story and I'm going to hurt him.' And she obviously
has," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chairlift discussion "never took place" and any meeting with
Grass took place well after the Thrifty Payless initial public
offering, he said. Grass could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to The Times last week, Leonard Green's attorney, Dale
F. Kinsella, wrote: "Jude Green's claims are utterly and completely
false.... Neither Mr. Green nor any of his representatives knew of
the buyout or met with Martin Grass during the time period in which
Jude Green alleges."</TE>
<TE>   Both Schweitzer and Buchholz, reached separately in Colorado,
called Jude Green's testimony a "complete fabrication."</TE>
<TE>   Schweitzer, who now sells real estate, acknowledged that he asked
Green to direct some of the stock from the Thrifty Payless IPO to
Buchholz--something executives commonly do. Schweitzer said he
immediately sold 100,000 shares, netting about $5,000 in profit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we chuckled because it was kind of a nonevent,"
Schweitzer said. "When you buy an IPO, you hope it appreciates as it
hits the market, and I guess it [Thrifty Payless] was pretty flat."</TE>
<TE>   Buchholz, an accountant, said: "I had directed shares, as well as
Boone. And that's where it ends. It's not insider trading."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Green takes a philosophical view of the troubles
that the divorce case has brought on his business ventures. He and
his partners are fortunate, Green says. They earn high salaries,
travel extensively and live in big houses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure this is going to make great reading for people who
aren't as lucky as we are," he said. "But we can't complain."</TE>

<HD>Idealab Investors May Have Tough Time in Court</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Group seeking to dissolve 'incubator' and recoup
some money represents less than 10% of shareholders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The disgruntled investors who sued Idealab Inc. on Friday seeking to
liquidate its assets and recoup at least some of their money are
unlikely to win in court, according to legal experts.</LD>
<LD>   Dell USA, T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund and others were
part of a $1-billion investment group that bought 10% of the
Pasadena-based Internet "incubator" at the height of the dot-com
frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the bubble has burst, the investors accuse Idealab
founder Bill Gross and other executives at the once highflying
company of keeping it alive solely for their personal gain, and they
want it dissolved before the remaining assets are frittered away.</LD>
<TE>   But legal experts say that these preferred shareholders should not
get their money back simply because they made a bad bet on the future
of Internet stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporations are meant to be permanent economic organizations,
not ones in which the minority investors can demand their money back
because market conditions have turned sour," said John Coffee, a
Columbia University law professor who specializes in corporate
governance and securities law. "They knew the risks."</TE>
<TE>   The key argument in the lawsuit is that Idealab's executives
treated the investors unfairly by using the money to "feather their
nests" instead of returning it once it became clear the market for
new Internet companies had dissipated, said Skip Miller, the attorney
representing the investors in their lawsuit, which was filed in Los
Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   It has been clear for more than a year that the dot-com boom is
over, and yet privately held Idealab continued to pour millions of
dollars into new start-ups that have little hope of success, Miller
said. If Gross and his cohorts really had the best interests of the
investors at heart, they would wind down the incubator and return the
remaining cash, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to inherent fairness," said Miller, a partner at
the Los Angeles firm Christensen, Miller.</TE>
<TE>   But fairness is not a legitimate basis for this kind of
shareholder lawsuit, legal experts said. The investors are entitled
only to the protections specifically laid out in their shareholder
agreements and nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   "As a general matter, judges tend to be reluctant to give
preferred stockholders rights beyond the contractual terms they
agreed to," said Henry Hu, a corporate law professor at the
University of Texas at Austin who has not read the complaint. "The
preferred shareholders want to just cut their losses and take their
money, but that's not the deal they negotiated. The judge is going to
be reluctant to in effect renegotiate the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Since they represent less than 10% of Idealab's shareholders, a
judge is even less likely to be sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for minority shareholders owning only 10% of the
company to convince the court that it should overrule the majority
and the board of directors," Coffee said. "This is a fairly weak
argument."</TE>
<TE>   The investors have tried to assert in private negotiations with
Gross that they are entitled to a majority of the company. They argue
that Idealab is worth little more than the $1 billion they invested
in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   They first approached Gross in November 2000 with a proposal to
take over 80% of the incubator and leave him with some of Idealab's
start-ups. Gross refused.</TE>
<TE>   They returned last Wednesday demanding a 90% stake in the company
"or else," said Marcia Goodstein, Idealab's president and chief
operating officer. After they were rebuffed again, they filed their
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The best that Idealab has offered is to return 10 cents on the
dollar, a deal that several investors accepted in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Gross' main strategy has been to appeal for patience. Despite the
freefall in Internet stocks and demise of Idealab fledglings such as
online toy seller EToys Inc., Gross insists the incubator is still
viable. "The climate is picking up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab has pared its operations in the last two years. Three of
the four satellite offices have closed, and its work force has been
cut from 230 in October 2000 to 93 today. The prospect of IPO riches,
once tantalizingly close, is now years away at best.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab has $360 million in liquid assets and is incubating nine
start-ups, including a broadband venture and a robotics firm. With
annual operating costs of $24 million and a $12-million investment
budget, the company has the resources to stay in business for five to
10 years, Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   Goodstein said the company's assets, although far smaller than
before, are growing, and that the investors have benefited from that
growth since the time of their first divestiture demand.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, if we had given them all of the cash and assets,
they would've gotten 6 cents on the dollar," said Goodstein, who is
engaged to Gross. "Now what we have is 36 cents on the dollar in
cash. If you include the other assets, it's 50 to 60 cents on the
dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Idealab has fared well compared with the two biggest
publicly traded incubators. CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., has seen its
stock plummet from a high of $147 in March 2000 to $1.83 on Friday.
Shares of Wayne, Pa.-based Internet Capital Group Inc. have fared
even worse, sinking from a high of $200 in January 2000 to $1.18 on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab's recent financial performance is almost entirely due to
the soaring stock price of Overture Services Inc., said Miller, the
investors' attorney. The Idealab hatchling, originally called
Goto.com, operates a pay-for-placement Web search engine and has seen
its stock more than triple from $12 in September to $37.67 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Idealab's balance sheet is relatively healthy now
underscores the need to liquidate while there are still assets left,
said Miller.</TE>

<TE>   Some Ideas Stuck, Some Shriveled</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, Idealab Inc. has spawned about 50 companies, some of
its best-known creations ultimately folding. Calculating the value of
Idealab is difficult because it has investments in so many young
companies whose worth is unclear. But the value of Idealab's stakes
in its publicly traded offspring alone is nearly $178 million.</TE>

<HD>At Andersen, 'Deep Pockets' Become Target</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Claims related to the Enron debacle could cost
top executives part of their stakes in the company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at Andersen may have to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars to settle litigation over the Enron Corp. debacle because the
accounting firm probably does not carry enough insurance to satisfy
what are expected to be massive claims.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's 4,700 top managers, known as partners, may lose some or
all of their personal investments in the firm, which range from about
$100,000 to more than $5million, said insurance, litigation and
accounting experts.</LD>
<LD>   "The [total] claims are likely to be somewhere in excess of $10
billion ... and may be $30 billion," said Mark Cheffers, chief ex-
ecutive of AccountingMalpractice .com, which advises accountants on
insurance issues.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's insurance coverage "is not remotely close to what the
potential exposure is here," he said. "I'm not sure it's even enough
to pay legal fees."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen representatives declined to comment about the firm's
insurance arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "The partners must be furious," said one former Andersen
executive, who asked not to be named. "There are a lot of talented
people there who had nothing to do with this."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen is under fire for its accounting treatment
of off-balance-sheet partnerships at Enron. The Houston energy
trader, which was forced to restate its earnings and shave
$586million off its reported profit over four years, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has admitted shredding documents and deleting e-mails
related to Enron after the Securities and Exchange Commission
launched an investigation of the energy company.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm is seen by many attorneys as one of the
"deepest pockets" in the Enron debacle--in other words, one of the
firms most likely to be able to pay the huge settlements expected in
the case. Andersen already has been named in numerous lawsuits filed
by shareholders and bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego attorney William Lerach, who has filed a shareholder
lawsuit against Andersen, said the financial cost of the lawsuits may
drive the smallest of the Big 5 firms into a buyer's arms but
probably not into Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't do our clients any good to bankrupt Arthur Andersen,"
said Lerach, referring to the firm by its former name. Andersen "may
have to be acquired by a larger firm, but they will survive."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen employs 84,000 people worldwide, including 1,500 in its
Los Angeles office, where clients include Edison International,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm reported global revenue of more than $9
billion last year. Andersen is a private company that does not
disclose financial details such as its net worth or how much equity
its partners have invested.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen and the four other major accounting
companies--PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and Deloitte &amp;
Touche--have largely been self- insured since the early 1990s, when
huge settlements over savings-and-loan accounting scandals strained
their insurance coverage, said Ron Klein, an attorney with Camico, a
Redwood City company that provides malpractice insurance for
accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Major reinsurance companies, such as Lloyd's of London, refused to
cover further accounting firm losses, leaving the accountants to
piece together smaller policies and set aside reserves in case of
future settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms typically are highly secretive about their
insurance arrangements. But insurance experts said large accounting
firms usually have liability insurance policies with huge
deductibles, which require the firms to pay the first $100 million to
$300 million of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Even with big deductibles, the policies don't cover unlimited
losses. The policies may cover the next $300 million to $500 million
of claims, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's total insurance coverage is unknown but is probably
less than $300 million, Cheffers said. Though Andersen's
limited-liability structure would prevent creditors from taking the
partners' personal assets, such as their homes and retirement
accounts, their investments in the firm would be fair game in
lawsuits, legal experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has two tracks for its partners: equity partners who may
earn $1 million or more a year and who share in the firm's profit and
loss; and national partners, who typically earn $200,000 to $800,000
annually and whose participation in the company's profit is more
limited. Executives become partners by paying typically about
$100,000, often with company- arranged financing, former employees
said.</TE>
<TE>   That stake usually grows through the years as the partners
contribute a portion of their earnings or profit. A partner who earns
$3 million for the firm in a year might be given $2 million in
compensation, with the remainder divided between his or her own
partnership stake and that of senior partners.</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely that partners' stakes have been tapped to pay
previous settlements, because the firm probably had enough insurance
and cash on hand to cover claims, insurance experts said. Andersen
paid $110 million last year to settle fraud allegations arising from
its accounting work for Sunbeam Corp., the appliance maker
reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is not the only large accounting firm to face big
settlements lately. Two years ago, Ernst &amp; Young agreed to pay $335
million to shareholders in Cendant Corp.; last year,
PricewaterhouseCoopers settled a similar suit regarding software firm
MicroStrategy Inc. for $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Andersen partners' stakes are offered as potential
payments in a lawsuit, however, partners may not lose all their
investments in the firm. A too-large settlement could drive off many
of the star partners who earn the bulk of the firm's revenue, so
plaintiffs' attorneys may agree to accept less to prevent such
fallout, Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, partners with smaller stakes may choose to abandon the firm
rather than wait to see the outcome of all the litigation, some
accountants said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were a first- or second-year partner with a good client
base, you'd need to reassess whether you want to stay," the former
Andersen executive said.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Probing Alleged Corruption by Pemex Execs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico's organized crime division is investigating charges of money
laundering and the embezzlement of more than $11 million by a
contingent of current and former officials at the state-run oil
monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.</LD>
<LD>   Accounting and Administrative Development Secretary Francisco
Barrio Terrazas said at a Saturday night news conference that
investigators had frozen the bank accounts of nine current and former
Pemex executives and an account controlled by the company's oil
workers union.</LD>
<LD>   Barrio Terrazas said prosecutors believe officials including
former Pemex director Rogelio Montemayor may have illegally
transferred more than $11 million in Pemex operating funds into the
union's bank account.</LD>
<TE>   With that account full of money that couldn't be traced by Pemex
accounts, current and former executives raided the union fund,
pocketing millions of dollars and making large cash payments to
influential friends, Barrio Terrazas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking into several aspects of the Pemex case," he said.
"There is one aspect of the case that effectively deals with improper
payments from the corporation to its union."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Romero Deschamps, a sitting senator who heads the company's
union, and Ricardo Aldana Prieto, another Pemex union boss and
lawmaker, are among those being investigated, Terrazas said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Romero Deschamps and Aldana Prieto are members of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has a majority in Congress
and held Mexico's presidency for 71 years until Vicente Fox took
office in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Barrio Terrazas, who made the announcement at the Mexico City
headquarters of Fox's Revolutionary Democracy Party, said the Pemex
investigation aimed to punish the company's "fat fish," or
bureaucrats who made a fortune pilfering money from Mexico's
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex director Raul Munoz Leos presented his company's annual
fiscal report at a formal ceremony Sunday but refused to comment on
Barrio Terrazas' announcement.</TE>

<HD>Flood of Earnings From About 155 Companies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The earnings dam will burst this week, unleashing a flood of numbers
and business forecasts that investors hope will buoy a stock market
desperate for signs of an economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The week will bring earnings news from about 155 companies in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, including nearly half of the 30
blue-chip names in the Dow Jones industrial average, according to
market research firm Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings are supposed to be down about 22.5%--the worst in a
decade--but investors are more focused on corporate forecasts.</LD>
<TE>   Because the stock market is closed Monday in observance of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, the numerous announcements will be compressed
into four days rather than five in the usual trading week.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will give
investors a reason to look beyond the earnings deluge when he ascends
the Capitol Hill steps Thursday, to testify before the Senate Budget
Committee on the state of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   His comments precede by nearly a week the Fed's next meeting on
Jan. 29-30 to consider lowering interest rates. If the Fed cuts
rates, it would be the 12th reduction in nearly 13 months.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Officials to Testify for House Panel</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A House subcommittee will require top officials from Andersen to
testify Thursday about the firm's destruction of Enron Corp.-related
documents last fall, after the firm knew Enron was being investigated
by federal regulators.</LD>
<LD>   ''We will invite them and if they decline the invitation we will
subpoena them,'' Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and
Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee, said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino--or a designee, such
as the company's general counsel, Andrew Pincus--is at the top of the
list of invitees, Johnson said. Also on the list are Nancy Temple, an
Andersen attorney who wrote a memo Nov. 10 telling Andersen employees
to preserve documents, and David Duncan, who was Andersen's lead
auditor on the Enron account until last week. Andersen fired Duncan
for what it said was the improper destruction of documents.</LD>
<TE>   The subcommittee also is considering inviting Michael Odom,
another Andersen auditor on the Enron account, Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Red Hat's Significance for AOL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reports that media giant AOL Time Warner Inc. may acquire Red Hat
Inc., a large distributor of the Linux computer operating system
software, suggest that AOL may be opening a new front in its
competition with Microsoft Corp.</LD>
<LD>   With Red Hat, AOL would gain technical and marketing expertise for
an operating system that competes with Microsoft Windows--the
software that runs some 90% of the world's personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   But the value of Red Hat in the ongoing competition between the
technology titans might be small at best, experts said. Few PC users
have adopted Linux, limiting its potential as a lever against
Microsoft's monopoly.</LD>
<TE>   Discussions between Red Hat and AOL were first reported Saturday
by the Washington Post, which cited unnamed sources. In a phone
interview Saturday, Red Hat Chairman Robert Young said he would not
comment on the report.  AOL executives could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   AOL and Microsoft compete head-to-head as Internet service
providers and content developers--AOL with its packaged online
offerings and vast electronic and print media holdings, Microsoft
with the MSN Web portal and the MSNBC cable network.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also has made large investments in cable companies. The
software giant wants to use those to establish Windows as a key
standard for set-top boxes used for interactive television--an
important area for AOL, as one of the largest cable TV providers.</TE>
<TE>   A serious foray into the Linux world might be viewed as a response
to Microsoft's incursions into AOL's key markets and a direct
challenge to Microsoft's flagship software product.</TE>
<TE>   AOL has the financial resources and market muscle to use Linux
against Microsoft, analysts agreed. "Whether or not they have the
will is another question," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga
Information Group. He called the supposed competitive advantages of
Red Hat for AOL "wishful thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Linux has become a major operating system for server computers
that operate networks of PCs. But because of its relative complexity,
Linux has gained little traction in the much larger market of typical
PC users.</TE>
<TE>   Red Hat has a market value of $1.4billion. It reported a loss of
$15million on sales of $21.5million in its third quarter ended Nov.
30. In the same period a year before, the firm lost $21.4million on
sales of $22.4million.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike typical software managed by a single company, Linux uses
the "open-source" method, relying on thousands of volunteer
programmers who collaborate on its development. Various forms of
Linux are available free online. Red Hat and other companies make
money by selling specialized versions of the product as well as
technical support and training for consumers and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Linux companies say the system gradually is becoming easier to
use. If it can be radically simplified, Linux may eventually become a
strong contender in entry-level PCs.</TE>
<TE>   "The general trend is that the PC is more and more like an
appliance," said Chris Le Tocq, a software analyst with SageCircle in
Los Altos, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks AOL could consider marketing a branded PC that uses
Linux and comes fully equipped with standard consumer
applications--such as software for office productivity, Web browsing
and digital photography. Such a device could be substantially less
costly than a Windows PC. The savings would come from using Linux and
other free open-source software in place of commercial offerings such
as Windows and Microsoft Office.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts have been tried without much success in the United
States. But Le Tocq said consumers in emerging markets where Windows'
dominance is not yet a foregone conclusion, such as China and Latin
America, might find a cheap alternative appealing. Such AOL-branded
machines would logically include a package deal for Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   "You see Microsoft getting itself into the hardware business" with
the new Xbox game device, Le Tocq said. "AOL will think it has to get
into the hardware business as well," making Red Hat a piece of that
larger puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in the likelihood of an AOL-Red Hat deal will be
the strategic outlook of Red Hat's top managers. Large or frequent
sales of stock by insiders sometimes suggest that a company is in
flux.</TE>
<TE>   From July 18 through Dec. 31 of last year, Young sold 886,000
shares of Red Hat stock in 179 transactions, receiving total proceeds
of about $4.5 million, according to Thomson Financial. He formally
proposed sales of about half a million shares, with proceeds
estimated at nearly $2 million. During that period, Red Hat's stock
rose from $3.63 to $7.10 a share; it closed Friday at $8.41, down 14
cents in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   In the same time frame, members of Young's family or their trust
funds proposed sales of more than half a million shares, with
proceeds estimated at $2million. There may be some overlap in the
proposed sales and actual shares sold.</TE>
<TE>   "You like it a lot better when a key player is on the buy side,"
said Enderle. "When they are selling over a long period of time, that
makes you nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Young said Saturday that the sales were routine and fell within
Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. As of Dec. 31, he
still held more than 6 million Red Hat shares worth more than
$50million.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm selling on almost a daily basis and in very small numbers.
[The sales] happen whether the stock's down or up," he said. "If you
look at my portfolio from the position of a financial advisor, I'm
hugely overweight with Red Hat stock, and I'm trying to get a little
bit of balance."</TE>
<TE>   Young added: "I'm hugely bullish on Red Hat stock in the long
run."</TE>
<TE>   AOL's strength has never been in software or hardware development,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's 1998 acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp.,
which produces the once-pioneering Navigator Web browser software,
was widely viewed as a move to create a credible counterweight to
Microsoft in the software market. But after AOL took over, most of
Netscape's top talent fled and Navigator was quickly eclipsed by
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.</TE>
<TE>   The Netscape experience did not inspire confidence about AOL's
ability to integrate innovative software companies smoothly into its
sprawling corporate structure.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Hat is the power player in the Linux market. AOL's purchase
of them would do Microsoft a huge favor, because they'd botch it,"
Enderle said.</TE>

<LD>Question: I work on the night shift for a small company that decided
to change to a new health insurance plan.</LD>
<LD>   The company arranged a meeting for workers on the day shift,
providing an insurance representative who explained the details of
the plan. The company refused requests for a similar meeting for
night shift employees, who have received no information other than a
notice that we need to hand in the paperwork for the new plan.</LD>
<LD>   Is there anything illegal about this situation? If so, what can be
done about it?</LD>
<TE>   --D.M., Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   Answer: An employer is required to provide information about the
benefits it provides its employees, although your company is not
required to schedule meetings for all shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Since no meeting is planned for your shift, you should consider
asking the human resources department for details of the new health
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Your request would be appropriate. To make intelligent decisions
about health insurance, you should have access to appropriate details
about the plan or choice of plans to determine how they affect you.
For example, doctors who are providing medical treatment to you or
your family may not be covered under a particular plan.</TE>
<TE>   If your employer fails to provide the information you request, you
should consider consulting an attorney.</TE>

<TE>   Credit for Unused Sick Time in Retirement Plan</TE>

retirement benefit as a monthly annuity, I will get credit for my
accumulated unused sick time. However, if I choose to take my
retirement benefit all at once in cash, I will lose credit for all of
my accumulated unused sick time.</TE>
<TE>   Can they do this?</TE>
<TE>   --J.K., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: Under most retirement plans, the amount of your service is
determined by the number of hours that you are paid--hours on the job
as well as paid vacation leave.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that accumulated unused sick time would fall into
this same category, but you should submit this question to the plan.
Rules regarding the claims procedure will be detailed in the summary
plan description that your employer is required to give you.</TE>
<TE>   If you do not get a satisfactory response from the plan, you
should consider seeking the assistance of the Department of Labor.</TE>

<TE>   Noncompetitive Pact Might Be Unlawful</TE>
<TE>   Q: Several months ago, I took a job with a small sales company.
Soon after I started, management approached me with a broad
noncompetitive agreement that stated I would not go to work for any
company that directly or indirectly competes against them for a
period of five years from the date of my departure, whether I resign
or am terminated.</TE>
<TE>   I signed the document because I feared losing my job.</TE>
<TE>   Can my employer legally make me sign such a document, even though
the position I took is entry level and the pay is modest?</TE>
<TE>   --S.G., San Bernardino</TE>
<TE>   A: Assuming that you are not being provided with any ownership
interest in the company, your employer cannot make you sign a
noncompetitive agreement.</TE>
<TE>   California law makes such agreements unlawful in most
circumstances. In fact, the courts regard that law to be so important
that they have held it is wrongful termination for an employer to
fire an employee for refusing to sign a noncompeting agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Your employer will not be able to enforce the agreement you signed
if you ever leave the firm.</TE>
<TE>   However, under California law, you can be sued if you were to
attempt to use your employer's trade secrets to compete against it,
regardless of whether you signed the noncompetitive agreement.</TE>

<HD>High-Speed Sprint</HD>
<DH>PCS unit is set to have the fastest nationwide U.S. mobile
network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Sprint PCS, it's pretty much come down to this: Make it big in
wireless data, or prepare to be eaten.</LD>
<LD>   William T. Esrey, chairman of parent Sprint Corp., prefers the
former and is pressing ahead with aggressive upgrades that by July
would produce the fastest coast-to-coast mobile data network system
in the country.</LD>
<LD>   For Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint PCS, the upgrades represent its
first real chance to catch up to the wireless giants that lead the
U.S. market: Verizon Wireless, Cingular Wireless and AT&amp;T Wireless.
Sprint PCS' growth so far has been impressive, giving it a subscriber
base that quintupled in the last five years to 14.4 million
customers.</LD>
<TE>   But in the booming U.S. wireless market, that's only good enough
for fourth place. Verizon Wireless, the market leader, has more than
twice as many customers, with 30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect the U.S. wireless industry to consolidate into two
or three giant carriers, and they believe that Sprint PCS must move
up the food chain in a hurry if it wants to be one of the survivors.</TE>
<TE>   If Esrey is rattled, it isn't showing. Sprint PCS has converted
two-thirds of its network to handle data at higher speeds, and that
progress makes him nearly giddy over what he calls a "substantial"
lead in the race toward third-generation mobile phone services. In
the long-heralded 3G era, wireless connections can handle everything
from video to e-mail attachments with relative ease.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be there, nationwide, in July, and other people
can't get there yet, so we will have one whale of a competitive
advantage," Esrey said. "There are very few times in business when
you get to stand on a mountain and look around, and not see a bunch
of troops coming up behind you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on Wireless Unit Has Parent at Risk</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agree that Sprint PCS is ahead of the pack and has
meaningful advantages in coming wireless data services. But it's
unclear if that will be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They are betting the farm on 3G, so if that doesn't go well, that
will probably be the end of Sprint PCS as an independent company,"
said Roger Wery, director of the communications group at PRTM, a
technology consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif. "If 3G gets only
niche adoption, it's going to be a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   And a disaster for Sprint PCS will be a disaster for Sprint, which
increasingly has relied on the wireless unit to offset plummeting
long-distance revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint PCS and its competitors, stung by a tepid customer response
to today's rudimentary mobile data services, are trying to make the
next incarnation of data services faster, easier to use and coupled
with applications compelling for both consumers and business users.</TE>
<TE>   The first upgrade for Sprint PCS will give customers always-on
connections to the Internet or corporate networks at speeds of up to
144 kilobits per second--more than double the speed of the fastest
dial-up modem.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, the division will complete a second
upgrade that will double the network's top speed to 288 kilobits per
second, with a jump to movie-capable 3-megabit speeds tentatively set
for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Customers who connect to Sprint PCS' wireless network through a
laptop computer, hand-held device or mobile phone probably will get
Internet connections about half that fast, because networks in live
use typically perform well below their peak speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, each of the first two upgrades will give Sprint PCS the
fastest nationwide mobile phone network in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Wireless, Cingular and Nextel
Communications also are upgrading their networks to handle e-mail,
pictures and other data at faster speeds. Some have launched services
in selected cities, but they lag far behind Sprint PCS in providing
the improvements coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   "Sprint PCS is smaller, but they have a homogeneous network, they
have cool devices and [company executives] made the right bet on
technology," said PRTM's Wery.</TE>
<TE>   But the investment by the carriers "is so massive and so broad,
that they will have to have masses of customers to offset the cost,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Few would have bet on Sprint PCS to lead the wireless pack six
years ago. The company had no wireless spectrum, no cell sites, no
customers and a shaky and unlikely partnership with three cable
companies to pursue the newly expanding wireless market in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In short order, the company bought up federal wireless licenses
that cover most of the country, including more than 4,000 cities and
communities and a population of 244 million.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Esrey and others at Sprint PCS took the biggest risk of all:
committing to build a national network using an unproven and
controversial technology known as code division multiple access, or
CDMA.</TE>
<TE>   That decision meant Sprint PCS initially had to fend off CDMA
critics, suffer through the technology's early glitches and pay more
for equipment and cell phones. But now the technology's ability to
squeeze more calls and data through limited airwaves, and its quick
evolution to high data-transmission speeds, are huge pluses at the
core of the wireless unit's competitive edge.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint PCS also paid significantly less for its wireless spectrum
than competitors. The company paid $3.2 billion for the spectrum it
uses, which will accommodate the spectrum-hogging 3G services. In
contrast, Verizon Wireless bid $4 billion in January 2001 just to
expand its spectrum holdings in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The country's top three carriers became giants mostly through
mergers and acquisitions, and that has left each of them with a
patchy network using multiple technologies and different parts of the
radio spectrum. The added complexity makes upgrading to 3G systems
more expensive and time-consuming.</TE>
<TE>   Esrey said Sprint PCS plans to spend $1.5 billion to complete the
two initial upgrades, using funds raised through stock and debt
offerings. The company would have had to spend that much on the
network anyway to complete a needed doubling of its voice capacity.
With the 3G upgrade, the division will double its voice capacity and
get 10 times higher connection speeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, we're spending zero additional dollars to convert
our network to 3G," Esrey said. "So if nobody took 3G, we wouldn't be
out anything--we'd just be extremely disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lower Cost Means Risk of Failure Is Less</TE>
<TE>   That gives Sprint PCS a solid advantage because "the other
carriers are going to spend two, three or four times as much," said
Andrew Cole, head of the wireless practice at consulting company
Adventis, which works with Sprint PCS and several other wireless
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "For Sprint [PCS], that means the risk of failure is less, the
debt they have to take on is less, and the payback is faster," Cole
said.</TE>
<TE>   Payback day is not far off, Esrey said. The company recently
warned that fourth-quarter results will not meet expectations because
of a less-than-spectacular holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sprint PCS, which has not released fourth-quarter results,
expects to trim its 2001 loss by an estimated 36% to $1.2 billion. It
projects a 54% gain in sales to about $9.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sprint PCS, one of two Sprint Corp. tracking stocks,
declined 63 cents to close at $17.01 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock has fallen 44% in the last year, but has
performed better than its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Since its launch, Sprint PCS has lost more than $6 billion, but
Esrey said he expects the company to be profitable in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the trail of losses, Wall Street thinks Sprint PCS is an
excellent takeover target.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the company has turned away bidders offering
"unbelievable amounts of money," according to Cole at Adventis, who
declined to name names or amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Esrey, who prefers to build networks rather than buy them, intends
to stick with the original plan: push the sale of long-distance
service to wireless customers and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of spinning off or selling something--I can't imagine a
scenario where that would make sense," Esrey said. "We'll continue to
attempt to control our own destiny, both offensively and
defensively."</TE>

<LD>Dog may be man's best friend, but for someone with a serious illness,
a cat may be the better companion.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers have long known that pets help relieve social
isolation and depression.</LD>
<LD>   People in declining health, who may lack energy and have
difficulty leaving the house often can't enjoy the simple pleasures
of dog ownership, such as walks in the park.</LD>
<TE>   In a survey of male pet owners with AIDS, researchers found that
cats--despite their reputation as being more aloof than
dogs--actually provided more comfort and companionship to their
owners than canines.</TE>
<TE>   Cats, which more commonly live indoors, made their owners feel
needed and provided a sense of stability beyond what friends and
family could offer, according to researchers at UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Men in declining health may find it stressful to be with a dog,
who may be excitedly requesting walks once or twice a day," said
Lynette A. Hart, an animal behaviorist at the UC Davis School of
Veterinary Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "The men were no longer working, not coming home from work and
receiving the joyous greeting from a dog. A cat that would just lie
on the bed and not expect very much could lead to a more compatible
relationship for these men."</TE>
<TE>   Hart's conclusions were based on responses of 60 men with AIDS who
were clients of Pets Are Wonderful Support, a San Francisco
organization.</TE>

<HD>Why Health Costs Sting Again</HD>
<DH>Patients are paying more for insurance premiums, doctor
visits and drugs. Managed care slashed spending but didn't get to the
root of the problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We all notice when prices rise at the gas pump, but fluctuations in
the price of medical care are harder to gauge. We don't buy health
care every week or so, as we do gasoline. But it's time we paid
attention, because the cost of medical care is rising quickly and
hitting many of us in the pocketbook.</LD>
<LD>   If you get health insurance through your job, you may have noticed
that your first paycheck of 2002 included a larger deduction than
last year for medical benefits. Or maybe you took a second look at
the bill when the pharmacist asked for a $40 co-payment for your
brand-name heart drug, which used to cost you just $10 out of pocket.
After a decade of relative stability, the cost of medical care in the
United States is soaring, and employers, who pay most of the tab for
private health insurance in this country, are asking workers to share
some of the pain brought on by premium hikes of as much as 20% this
year. For those who have no insurance coverage, higher costs mean
it's harder to get care as hospitals have less money for charity
cases, and free clinics reduce hours of service.</LD>
<LD>   And health experts say the worst of rising prices isn't over.</LD>
<TE>   Why is this happening? Wasn't managed care supposed to bring
health costs under control with its tighter scrutiny of all things
medical? In the early 1990s, health-care spending increases were in
the double digits. That's when worried employers called in HMOs and
asked them to slow down the rise in medical costs.. They did, and
employers switched millions of Americans into health plans that
restricted the choice of doctors and made it more difficult to see
specialists or get approval for certain medical tests.</TE>
<TE>   How did managed-care companies get costs down? They promised
employers lower premiums if they switched large numbers of workers
into their plans. The HMOs then demanded deep discounts from doctors
and hospitals, promising in exchange to send more patients their way.
And health plans worked to cut the obvious waste from the
system--cracking down on unnecessary visits to pricey physician
specialists and demanding that patients be sent home from the
hospital as quickly as practical.</TE>
<TE>   The average number of days people stayed in the hospital dropped
dramatically. Price pressures forced a lot of poorly managed
hospitals to close their doors or merge with more financially stable
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Managed care did a great job of achieving a one-time savings.
Without it, medical inflation would be a lot worse. But managed care
never tackled the fundamental reasons costs were rising in the first
place. HMOs couldn't do much about rising labor costs at hospitals or
changes in the way medical care is delivered, such as the shift to
more outpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   Health plans also couldn't control the soaring costs of
prescription drugs as hundreds of new, often costly drugs came to
market. HMOs have tried to persuade doctors to prescribe less
expensive drugs, such as generics. But health plans have had little
control over escalating prices of drugs in general. Pharmaceutical
companies set their own prices based on their research and
development costs and profit goals. And managed care has been unable
to get at some deeper problems, such as weeding out inappropriate
uses of technologies, tests and treatments--the ineffective practice,
for example, of doctors writing prescriptions for antibiotics to
treat colds. Instead, health plans have tried to discourage the use
of unneeded medical services by requiring doctors to get
"preauthorization" of treatments and tests. Doctors and patients have
generally despised these restrictions. Moreover, these barriers were
"weak, untargeted and did little to contain costs or get at the root
causes," says Dr. Mark Chassin, head of the health policy department
at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   And these penny-pinching practices have also led to a public
backlash against HMOs, now viewed by many Americans as ruthless
deniers of medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, hospitals and doctors have vigorously resisted the
HMOs' cost-cutting efforts, claiming that medical care is suffering
as a result. Now many HMOs have relaxed or eliminated cost controls,
such as the use of primary physician "gatekeepers" who guard against
unnecessary specialist referrals. Those strategies may be lost
forever, said Dr. Andrew Wiesenthal of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland.
"They ticked off patients who believed they had a God-given right to
have whatever procedure they wanted whenever they wanted. Care is
just going to get more costly now."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, employers thought they had an answer. Now there's
no consensus. Some employers believe that persuading workers to take
better care of their health might help. Others will shift more of the
cost to workers by raising deductibles or co-payments, hoping to make
employees think twice before going to the doctor. Those strategies
don't attack the root causes of escalating costs any better than
managed care did.</TE>
<TE>   Unless managed care can reinvent itself or some new silver bullet
is found, those at the helm of the nation's health-care system are a
little like Capt. Kirk steering the starship Enterprise into the vast
unknown.</TE>

<LD>By the time many women realize they have reached menopause, they have
missed the chance to ease symptoms, stave off early bone loss or even
become pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   Menopause is not formally diagnosed until a woman has completed a
full year with no menstrual period. But by that time many have
suffered hot flashes, insomnia or other symptoms without
understanding their significance.</LD>
<LD>   Two new developments, however, may help women understand the
changes in their bodies--and make health decisions accordingly.</LD>
<TE>   In the first, doctors have now labeled the stages of reproductive
aging.  By assessing hormone levels and menstrual cycle patterns,
they place women in one of seven categories related to
fertility--from "early reproductive" to "late postmenopause."</TE>
<TE>   Use of the stages, the doctors say, will give women and their
physicians a more accurate picture of where women are in the aging
process. It also should encourage earlier discussions about the
gradual decline of fertility, leading to better decisions about
pregnancy planning, contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy and
strategies to avoid uncomfortable symptoms linked to menopause.</TE>
<TE>   In the other development, a North Carolina company has developed a
home menopause test kit that will show women whether they are
beginning to lose fertility.</TE>
<TE>   "Many women really want to understand what is going on with their
bodies," says E.C. Henley, executive vice president of Physicians
Laboratories, the maker of the Menopause Home Test. "If you are 45
and are having irregular periods, or something is different, then it
might be important to get a real-time indication of your menopausal
status."</TE>
<TE>   Closer attention to women's health issues over the last two
decades has clarified the impact of menopause, says Dr. Robert Rebar,
associate executive director of the American Society of Reproductive
Medicine, which helped create the new definitions of reproductive
aging. There is good evidence, for example, that hormonal changes
that accompany menopause can affect other organs in the body.</TE>
<TE>   And there are social reasons to get a better handle on female
aging, Rebar says. "Our population is aging, but we don't regard the
average age of menopause--51--as being elderly anymore," he says.
"And as more women delay childbearing in order to begin careers,
there are more older women wanting to have children but discovering
they are perimenopausal."</TE>
<TE>   Perimenopause is generally described as the years prior to
menopause, when women can begin experiencing symptoms such as missed
periods, decreased fertility, hot flashes and weight gain. The new
stages distinguish women who are beginning the transition from those
who are further along.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the two new tools, however, will give women hard and
fast answers, Rebar and others warn. In fact, the women's health
experts who labeled the phases were surprised that they could come up
with even broadly defined stages.</TE>
<TE>   What researchers could agree on is "that the terminology is all
garbled," says Dr. Michael R. Soules, director of the division of
reproductive endocrinology at the University of Washington. "There is
premenopause, perimenopause, the menopause transition. Everyone knew
these [terms] weren't really defined."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem with the use of such terms is in research,
Soules said. Studies of perimenopausal women, for example, often look
at people who differ in symptoms and age. It is difficult, then, to
apply the findings of those studies--such as whether a particular
herb may relieve hot flashes--to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   To overcome the differences in terminology and ages, the new
stages focus on objective data, including the length and variability
of menstrual cycles and the level of a particular hormone called
follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH. FSH is produced by the
pituitary gland in the brain to prod the ovaries to develop and
release eggs.</TE>
<TE>   An increase in the hormone is thought to constitute a decline in
fertility, Rebar says.</TE>
<TE>   The stages are similar to the well-known Tanner/Marshall system
for defining puberty. In that system, clues such as breast
development and body hair are used to estimate where a girl is in the
years-long process of puberty.</TE>
<TE>   The method of determining reproductive aging, which was produced
by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the National
Institute on Aging and the North American Menopause Society, was
published simultaneously in four medical journals late last year.</TE>
<TE>   But experts caution that it is still very rudimentary. "You can
detect elevated levels of FSH, but we still can't say if that stage
[in a particular woman] will be six months long, a year long or a
decade long," Rebar says.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hope to fine-tune the phases' definitions as more
techniques are developed that explain reproductive aging. For
example, says Soules, ultrasound imaging of the ovarian follicles may
yield information in the future about aging.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors caution that defining the stages of menopause does not
mean that women need to have regular FSH blood tests. And many are
dubious about the usefulness of the Home Menopause Test because it
just looks at a single symptom of reproductive aging.</TE>
<TE>   While many doctors order FSH blood tests, which cost about $50,
for women who are experiencing menopausal symptoms, the home test
allows women to learn FSH levels on their own. The urine test was
cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999,
although it has not been available in the U.S. until recently.</TE>
<TE>   According to the manufacturer, two consecutive readings of
elevated FSH indicate that a woman is in the menopausal transition.
What this means to an individual woman may vary, says Henley of
Physicians Laboratories. "There are very extensive patient education
materials enclosed with the test," Henley says. "Women are
recommended repeatedly to discuss the results with their physician."</TE>
<TE>   The test kit, which costs about $60, may appeal to women who think
that their doctors don't try hard enough to help them understand
reproductive aging, says Susan Doughty, a nurse practitioner and
director of the New England WomenCenter in Portland, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   "Women want to know, 'Where am I in the process? When am I likely
to stop bleeding?'" she says. "But it's like getting your blood
pressure done; it's helpful to take the information and have it put
into context. It's a piece of the picture, but it's not the only
piece."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Stages of a Woman's Reproductive Life</TE>
<TE>   The new method of determining reproductive aging takes into
account the length and variability of menstrual cycles, plus the
level of a hormone that prompts the ovaries to release eggs. Before
menopause, the length of the stages varies.</TE>
<TE>   Early Reproductive--Menstrual cycles variable to regular; level of
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is normal.</TE>
<TE>   Peak Reproductive--Menstrual cycles regular; FSH is normal.</TE>
<TE>   Late Reproductive--Menstrual cycles regular, but FSH is elevated.</TE>
<TE>   Early Menopausal Transition--Length of menstrual cycle varies by
seven days or more; FSH is elevated.</TE>
<TE>   Late Menopausal Transition--Two or more menstrual cycles are
skipped, with an interval between cycles of 60 days or more; FSH is
elevated.</TE>
<TE>   (Menopause occurs--This is not a stage but is defined as 12 months
without a menstrual period.)</TE>
<TE>   Early Postmenopause--Lasts for four years after menopause; FSH is
elevated.</TE>
<TE>   Late Postmenopause--Lasts until death; FSH is elevated.</TE>
<TE>   These stages should not be applied to all women, researchers
caution. They recommend the exclusion of women who smoke, who are
very heavy or very thin, who do heavy aerobic exercise, who have
chronically irregular menstrual cycles, who have had a hysterectomy
or who have uterine fibroids or endometriosis.</TE>

<HD>Exploring Sexual Legends Can Help Teens Get Beyond the
Myths</HD>
<DH>Some say discussion of urban tales is a way for youths to
separate fact from fiction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like urban myths, the contemporary sexual legends that are passed off
as truth by adolescents often center on graphic and bizarre facts.</LD>
<LD>   Usually, the legends focus on libidinous behavior that, once
discovered, humiliates the "oversexed" protagonist--the girl who gets
pregnant in a hot tub without having sex, for instance, or the teen
whose one-night stand leads to a deadly surprise.</LD>
<LD>   A collection of sexual legends promulgated by adolescents is
explored and interpreted in a book published last year. "Did You Hear
About the Girl Who ... ? Contemporary Legends, Folklore, &amp; Human
Sexuality" was written by Mariamne H. Whatley and Elissa R. Henken.</LD>
<TE>   Whatley, a biologist and professor of women's studies at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Henken, a folklorist and
professor in the English department at the University of Georgia at
Athens, claim that much of what teenagers believe about their bodies
and human sexuality is learned informally on the playground, in
school halls and from the lore shared among classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than ignoring the legends as teen piffle, the pair, who are
sisters, argue that health educators, clinicians and anyone who works
with adolescents should make use of sexual lore to speak to teenagers
in their own language. The legends are windows on the world of
adolescents, openings to a discourse about what they believe,
question or have heard about sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   In a piece for "Women's Review of Books," a monthly publication
out of Wellesley College, psychologist and sex expert Leonore Tiefer
applauds the book. The authors, she writes, "propose a wonderful
interdisciplinary idea ... using sexual urban legends as part of high
school and college sex education ... a corrective to the often
ineffectual attempts of sex educators to stamp out sexual myths with
earnest recitations of facts ... [they] view classroom discussion of
urban sex legends as one way of dealing with students' persistently
irrational beliefs. In their eyes, irrationality must be explored,
not dismissed."</TE>
<TE>   Sexual legends, like a well-narrated story, are more compelling,
salient and widespread than the dry information in sex education
textbooks, write Whatley and Henken. The stories resonate deeply with
adolescents who are trying to figure out the mechanics of sex and
what is acceptable--information they are more likely to accept as
fact from friends than from teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching by facts is not good pedagogical technique," said
Whatley. "Facts also can coexist with misinformation. Students can
learn about physiology and how reproduction works, but they may still
firmly believe that they won't get pregnant if they have sex standing
up."</TE>
<TE>   Sexual legends often spring from the anxieties or desires of
adolescents. Consider the widespread story of "the promiscuous
cheerleader" who performs a sex act on each player of the basketball
team. She collapses and has to be rushed to an emergency room, where
her stomach is pumped, providing proof of her indiscretion.</TE>
<TE>   This legend often circulates among boys in middle school, for whom
cheerleaders may be unattainable, but highly desirable sexual
objects, according to an analysis by Northwestern University
sociologist Gary Alan Fine in his 1992 book, "Manufacturing Tales:
Sex and Money in Contemporary Legends."</TE>
<TE>   " ... Since semen is largely protein," he writes, "there is no
medical rationale for pumping the girl's stomach. The stomach pumping
serves as punishment."</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Fine summed up the legend's message:
"The girl getting her stomach pumped puts the world in balance
because a sexually aggressive woman cannot be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   Whatley and Henken propose that health educators and others who
work with adolescents elicit legends from students by asking, "What
have you heard about ...?" or by placing a "things you've heard box"
in the classroom. In critically examining a legend, an adolescent
should be asked to consider whether it is medically or physically
possible (such as the tale of the sperm that made its way to the girl
in hot tub, impregnating her).</TE>
<TE>   The authors also urge educators and parents to help adolescents
understand the underlying moral and social messages inherent in
sexual legends.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers should also be asked to discuss whether legends have
positive or negative messages. A legend about a gay roommate drugging
his heterosexual roommate to have sex with him reinforces homophobic
beliefs that gay men are predatory. A legend about how having sex
while standing cannot result in pregnancy could, indeed, lead a
misinformed teen to unwanted pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Last, the authors suggest that students be asked to determine why
a particular legend exists, how it maintains what is acceptable in a
group and what cultural attitudes foster it. All of this helps
adolescents understand and dispel the legends, while learning the
basics about human sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that legends do is take beliefs that can't be
expressed directly, such as stereotypes, homophobic and racist
beliefs," said Fine. "When you are talking about things that have
ostensibly happened to you or someone you know, you have license to
state these beliefs, even if it is by repeating rumor or legend."</TE>
<TE>   What makes some sexual legends compelling is that they often
contain a grain of truth. "Many legends contain the possibility of
being true. Even if some part of it is wrong, other parts may be
true," said Henken.</TE>
<TE>   Take the widespread legend about a girl on spring break in Florida
who meets a guy and falls in love. The final night of vacation, she
sleeps with him. He gives her a tiny box as she leaves, telling her
not to open it until she arrives at school. Upon opening it, she
finds a miniature coffin inside inscribed: "Welcome to the wonderful
world of AIDS." (Male version: A man spends the night with a woman he
picks up in a bar. The next morning he finds scrawled on the mirror
in lipstick: "Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS. ... ")</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that unprotected intercourse can result in the
transmission of AIDS," said Whatley. "And it is true that a person
could fall in love with someone who has AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   The authors collected hundreds of sexual legends. The legends
heard in the U.S. were similar to those heard in Australia and
England.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics suggest that American sex educators could do a better
job, compared with their international counterparts. U.S. teenagers
have the highest pregnancy rate compared with Germany, France,
England and Holland and 25 times the rate of HIV infection, according
to a 1999 Kaiser Family Foundation study.</TE>
<TE>   Though a wave of abstinence-only sex education is spreading across
the country (23% of public school districts teach abstinence-only sex
education), Whatley and Henken are optimistic that there is room for
discussion of graphic, sexual legends and that such discussion would
help educators, health workers and parents address specific
misconceptions adolescents hold about sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "If students themselves are raising the questions, there is more
flexibility for discussion even in school districts that teach
abstinence-only curriculum," said Whatley. "Creative teachers could
do a lot with contemporary sexual legends."</TE>

<LD>DEATH AT THE PRIORY</LD>
<LD>   Sex, Love, and Murder in</LD>
<LD>   Victorian England</LD>
<TE>   By James Ruddick</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic Monthly Press</TE>
<TE>   210 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although accounts of murders can be found as far back as the story
of Cain and Abel in Genesis, the literary form of the murder mystery
only began to flourish in the 19th century, the age of Edgar Allan
Poe, Wilkie Collins and Arthur Conan Doyle.</TE>
<TE>   It may have had something to do with the establishment of regular
police forces in cities such as London, and the emerging use of
scientific methods to solve crimes. More important, perhaps, there's
something very compelling about the contrast between the solid,
orderly, eminently "respectable" edifice that the Victorians strove
to project and the sudden intrusion of disorder, disgrace, sin and
mayhem into such sedate lives.</TE>
<TE>   The element of mystery lies in uncovering the secrets hidden below
the surface.</TE>
<TE>   The real-life mystery of the Charles Bravo case has fascinated
generations of armchair sleuths. Everyone from Queen Victoria's
physician, Sir William Gull (who ministered to the victim on his
deathbed), to mystery writer Agatha Christie has had his or her own
theory about whodunit and why.</TE>
<TE>   Now adding his conjectures to the list is British journalist and
television researcher James Ruddick in "Death at the Priory."</TE>
<TE>   The scandalous story of Bravo's death by poison excited feverish
interest at the time. Yet although it seemed clear that a murder had
taken place, none of the likely suspects, indeed no one, was ever
charged with the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old dead man was a handsome, ambitious attorney with
political aspirations. Only a few months before his death in April
1876, he had married Florence Ricardo, a wealthy, beautiful and young
widow with a scandalous past.</TE>
<TE>   From almost the start of their marriage, the couple did not get
on: Bravo's domineering ways antagonized not only his wife but
several of the servants, including Florence's trusted companion and
housekeeper, Jane Cox, a genteel, resourceful, middle-age widow with
three children to support.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the eminent doctor James Gully (not to be
confused with the equally eminent doctor William Gull).</TE>
<TE>   The kindly sexagenarian Gully had been Florence's lover before her
marriage to Bravo, and he had entertained some hope of wedding
Florence.</TE>
<TE>   When Bravo collapsed onto his bed on the night in question,
vomiting and writhing in pain, it was soon evident to the physicians
called in that he had ingested poison. But was it suicide, an
accidental overdose or murder?</TE>
<TE>   As in a classic mystery novel, there were too many plausible
suspects: an abused wife, her disappointed ex-lover and several
disgruntled servants including the clever Mrs. Cox, who seemed
exceedingly anxious to convince the doctors that Bravo had committed
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   But there was not enough hard evidence to prove that any of them
had done it, and so, although a much-publicized inquest was held, no
charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddick attacks his juicy subject with relish, taking us through
the story step by step and providing richly colorful portraits of all
the main characters, from Florence--spirited, headstrong, passionate
and more than a little spoiled by her wealthy parents--to Bravo,
possessed of intelligence, wit and a great zest for life, but also
dictatorial, miserly and devious.</TE>
<TE>   As Ruddick puts it, "He was the sort of man to whom your mind
would instinctively turn when you were told that someone had been
expelled from your club for cheating at cards."</TE>
<TE>   When Bravo met Florence, she was the widow of an abusive if
dashingly handsome guardsman who had driven her into the arms of the
kindly Gully. Florence's love affair with Gully (a distinguished
doctor whose patients had included Tennyson, Dickens and Gladstone)
had brought scandal to them both, and the racy details of the story
came out again at the inquest, creating an even bigger scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddick wants us to see Florence's story in the context of English
Victorian culture. Florence, as he portrays her, was a victim of the
times in which she lived when her craving for sexual fulfillment and
her wish to do as she pleased with her own money were considered to
be "unwomanly."</TE>
<TE>   Stubborn enough to go after what she wanted, she was not
unconventional enough to risk social ruin by joining herself to the
sexually satisfying, proto-feminist but socially disgraced Gully. In
marrying Bravo, she was trying to repair her reputation. In pursuing
a woman who was "damaged goods," Bravo was most likely after her
money. Their brief marriage was a war of wills between a domineering,
politically conservative Victorian man and a hot-blooded woman
determined to resist his domination.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Ruddick claims to have solved the mystery,
helped in his task by new evidence he uncovered while interviewing
descendants of the various principals, whom he managed to track down.</TE>
<TE>   He makes a persuasive case that neatly ties up many a loose end.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not he has finally uncovered the truth, Ruddick has
provided us with a highly plausible theory as well as a suspenseful
and stimulating read.</TE>

<LD>Stanton Samenow snapped awake in the middle of the night, sweating
and thinking about the case. It was 2 a.m. He turned to his wife.
"I'm deep in the case, and I don't understand it at all," he moaned.
"I don't know who should have custody. It's like being lost in the
woods. I'm supposed to be the expert, and I haven't got a clue."</LD>
<LD>   Dorothy comforted him, as she always has. "Just stick with it,
Stanton. It will become clear."</LD>
<LD>   In 1984, a Fairfax County, Va., judge asked Alexandria clinical
psychologist Samenow (pronounced SAM-en-ow) to act as an independent
evaluator in a custody fight. The parents were at war, the children
in torment. The judge needed insight into what was actually going on.</LD>
<TE>   Samenow, a nationally known expert on criminal behavior at the
time, dove into the turmoil of that first case --allegations of sex
abuse gave it a possibly criminal taint -- and eventually prepared
detailed recommendations that worked to the benefit of the kids.</TE>
<TE>   He began taking on similar cases -- the most difficult custody
fights, the nightmare stuff of film and fable. Marriage counseling
had failed, mediation had failed, even litigation had failed in some
instances as the cases dragged on. Judges had thrown up their hands.</TE>
<TE>   Samenow was entering a dark area of human nature, a maelstrom of
emotional horror reminiscent of his work with criminals and juvenile
delinquents. Divorcing parents often acted the same way -- lying,
manipulating and even abusing each other and their offspring as they
struggled for the prize--custody.</TE>
<TE>   Invariably, they proclaimed "love" for their kids. Samenow,
however, saw that the children were pawns, their lives being ripped
apart. They needed help, and his heart went out to them.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to be a kid, like other kids," a tearful boy told
him.</TE>
<TE>   A girl was so upset she was tearing the flesh off her arm.</TE>
<TE>   One child was abducted from Samenow's office by a parent.</TE>
<TE>   Others were so fearful, they scarcely dared to speak. They ranged
in age from infants to 16-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Court-appointed independent evaluators--psychologists, social
workers, psychiatrists--weren't a new tool in U.S. divorce courts,
but Samenow made the job something more. He became a
psycho-detective. He interviewed parents and children at length,
administering psychological tests. He talked with relatives, friends,
neighbors, teachers, clergy, doctors, baby sitters, bosses, even
other psychologists who had treated the parents. He made home visits,
sometimes hiring helpers who spent weekends observing a family at
home over half a year.</TE>
<TE>   His goal was to learn the elusive "truth," sorting out charges and
countercharges, in effect psychoanalyzing the parents, getting to
know them so well that he could recommend exact details for realistic
custody arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   It was exhausting and frustrating work, but Samenow's persistence
usually paid off. People could keep up a good front for a time, but
eventually revealed their true natures as family events unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he wasn't popular--not with the kids, not even with the
parent who appeared to "win." It was scary to be scrutinized, and--at
$225 an hour--expensive. (Parents had agreed, urged by judges or
lawyers, to share the cost.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the end, these independent evaluations often led to
out-of-court settlements, and were less expensive and more
satisfactory than endless wrangling in court before judges who had
only limited knowledge of the characters and circumstances of the
drama.</TE>
<TE>   "He always impressed me with his competence and integrity," says
Richard Jamborsky, retired chief judge of the Fairfax County Circuit
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes parents hire their own psychological experts. "When you
start having these hired guns," Jamborsky says, "as a judge it drives
you crazy." Sometimes when this happened, it was a relief to have
Samenow as "the court's expert."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm promoting responsibility and personal integrity," he says.
"I'm asking people to stop and look at what they're doing, what
effect it's having on their children. I recognize that, despite the
horrible things people do, in some form they do love their children.
I'm not into demonizing any parent."</TE>
<TE>   Samenow divides parents into three categories--problem solvers,
controllers and the impaired. He explains what happens when one type
is divorcing another, and emphasizes the importance of approaching
divorce and its aftermath as a problem solver: "I have yet to meet a
happy controller. Moreover, during divorce proceedings that
controller will inflict additional misery, grinding down his or her
spouse emotionally, capitalizing on the slightest sign of weakness.
The child is victimized."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, "if you succeed in setting aside personal
vendettas and approach separation and divorce as a problem to solve,
you in fact will be acting in the best interest of your child."</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst things, he writes, is when one side conducts a
"parentectomy"--freezing the other out of their children's lives.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming that she'd suffered emotional and physical abuse, Lois
worried about the safety of their daughter Mary, 7. But Mary didn't
seem at all afraid. Rather she always spoke of having a fun time with
her dad. Her sister Amy, 4, expressed similar sentiments. Asked what
she wished for more than anything in the world, Amy exclaimed, "My
daddy!"</TE>
<TE>   Samenow believed Lois had some legitimate, although exaggerated,
concerns about her husband. The challenge for her was to bear in mind
that, whatever Frank's flaws, he remained the children's father, and
they adored him. Mary and Amy should have been able to enjoy their
father without their mother's apprehensions intruding.</TE>
<TE>   Samenow made recommendations along these lines, at the same time
working with the mother in ways to help change her attitudes and ease
tensions for the children. "Your child has lost the family unit," he
warns. "Don't let him or her lose a parent too."</TE>
<TE>   As for the case that snapped him awake the other night, "it's very
disturbing, because the mother has really done things to interrupt
the parent-child bond, but the father has also, and I don't know if
what I'm finding out about either of them is really true. There's
something insidious going on here. It's my job to find out what it
is."</TE>
<TE>   What do the kids think?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't enjoy it at all," a 15-year-old girl says by phone, on
condition of anonymity. "I talked to a lot of different
professionals, and I remember enjoying others more than him. It
wasn't kid-friendly. It was a kind of bleak office. I never really
felt I could open up with him. The thing I remember most is sitting
there pulling the threads out of my chair."</TE>
<TE>   She was 6 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Samenow isn't surprised. "She was in a horrible situation. I felt
like the Inquisition and the dentist combined. This is the agony of
this kind of work."</TE>
<TE>   How is life now for this busy teenager living with her mother?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm completely happy," she says. " ... Everything turned out
completely fine."</TE>
<TE>   What about that tearful boy who'd told Samenow, "I just want to be
a kid"? Now he's 22, in college. "My parents got divorced when I was
9," he recalls by phone. "I wanted to live with my dad, but for a
long time I couldn't because the courts kept ruling I had to spend
more time with my mom. I was frustrated and mad.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Samenow wasn't involved till after a year or two. I'm here to
tell you, it's really hard to come into an office and sit in front of
a professionally dressed person who has nothing to do with your
life."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, he realized Samenow was helping him. When he was 14, he
got to live with his father. "I began to appreciate Dr. Samenow more.
Perhaps it was my perceptions that changed, but he ... was trying to
do what he thought best for me, though that was not something I
understood at the time."</TE>

<LD>So it's payback time, you wily, old Jinx. Finally, you're plastered
on the cover of Sports Illustrated, sprung to life in the form of a
lone black cat. The headline: "The Cover that No One Would Pose for:
Is the SI Jinx for Real?"</LD>
<LD>   In the magazine's current issue, an investigative team attempts to
deconstruct the Jinx, or the enduring superstition that the cover of
Sports Illustrated brings bad luck. Consider the numbers, teases
senior writer Alexander Wolff in the Jan. 21 edition. In a six-month
investigation, Wolff and a research team looked into almost all of
Sports Illustrated's 2,456 covers, starting with the first one in
August 1954. According to their research, within two weeks of a cover
appearance, a person or team ran into bad luck about 37% of the
time--an injury, a losing streak, a batting slump or worse. (The
Jinx, apparently, has left the annual swimsuit cover girls
untouched.)</LD>
<LD>   The point being? That Shaquille O'Neal should flee from the
magazine's cover photographers if he hopes to land a free throw in
the near future?</LD>
<TE>   The point being that "the myth is out there," says Wolff in a
phone interview. "People talk about it all the time, in e-mail, in
sports talk radio. ... I wasn't so much validating it as [thinking]
we're sitting on top of this story."</TE>
<TE>   Sports Illustrated could no longer let the so-called cover curse
go unchallenged after the Jinx's apparent wild ride in 2001, Wolff
says. Last spring, for instance, the Jinx appeared to frown upon the
cover photo of shirtless Boston Red Sox star Nomar Garciaparra, who,
a few days after his bare-chested display, suffered a wrist injury
that sidelined him for much of the season. Oregon State--the
magazine's preseason top-ranked team--lost its opening game after its
star running back appeared on the cover; the team went on to have the
worst record of a No. 1 pick. And on and on, leading to a Jinx
backlash by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh TV and talk-radio stations, for instance, urged their
audiences to boycott Sports Illustrated in protest of a cover
featuring their beloved Steelers. St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt
Warner--who wears a No. 13 jersey--declined to pose with the black
cat on the Jinx cover. (Warner came down with the flu anyway last
week before his big divisional playoff game, so we're not sure what's
going on there.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, some well-known sports figures have announced that
they don't want to be on any Sports Illustrated cover. Take former
New England Patriots coach Bill Parcells. After a major victory in
1996, he called his daughter, who works at the magazine, and barked:
"No cover."</TE>
<TE>   The Jinx, though famous in its own way, isn't in the same
creeping-out-the-masses league as, say, a 13th-floor elevator stop.
"I think it's just a fun thing for people to talk about," says Los
Angeles Kings spokesman Mike Altieri. People still murmur about what
happened to Wayne Gretzy, who was a December cover boy as a King star
in 1989. Days later, his streak of consecutive-game assists ended
before he could break the NHL record.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2001, Fresno State's football coaches didn't think
Jinx when quarterback David Carr made the cover. "They don't worry
about the Jinx," university spokesman Tom Uribes says. "They don't
believe in it." (Carr, by the way, ended up leading the national
statistics in yards passing and touchdown passes.)</TE>
<TE>   According to Wolff's story, sports psychologists and statisticians
have offered a plausible explanation for the Jinx. Experts say that
the Jinx illustrates a "regression to the mean." Translation: A
quarterback who is hot enough to make the cover has to go cold at
some point. Wolff also quotes a sports psychologist who says the Jinx
could represent "a failure to efficiently metabolize heightened
expectations." Translation: Some athletes choke after such
high-profile exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The article, while tongue in cheek, also is meant to raise
questions on the serious subject of athletes and pressure, Wolff
says. What the article doesn't do is answer the question of whether
the Jinx is real.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the Jinx as been part of the same mystical sports
lore that says Reggie Jackson morphed into a batting machine every
October, that the Red Sox have been cursed since they traded Babe
Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920. So why throw cold water on what
could be a bit of magic, even if it's black magic?</TE>
<TE>   And if the Jinx does exist and is true to form, it stands a good
chance of self-imploding within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Wolff borrows the wisdom of Carl Sagan, quoting from
his book "The Demon-Haunted World." "What's the harm of a little
mystification?" Sagan wrote. "It sure beats boring statistical
analyses."</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned--no word, yet, on the subject of Sports Illustrated's
next cover....</TE>

<LD>On Jan. 28, Jewish people in Los Angeles and all over the world will
celebrate the festival of Tu B'Shvat (the 15th day of the month of
Shvat in the Hebrew calendar). This holiday has another name, Rosh
Hashana le-Ilanot, or the New Year for Trees. It is Jewish tradition
to measure the age of trees each year on this day. It is important to
know this because in ancient Israel (as well as in some Jewish
communities today) the fruit of a tree was not to be eaten until the
fourth year of the tree's life.</LD>
<LD>   Many people celebrate this holiday with a festive meal called a Tu
B'Shvat Seder, during which they eat many different fruits and nuts
while expressing thanks to God for the gifts of nature. Some will
also study verses in the Bible and other Jewish texts that tell about
fruit and trees. But the most popular activity by far is the planting
of new trees. Among Jews in the United States, it's traditional to
purchase trees for others to plant in the land of Israel.</LD>
<LD>   At the Skirball Cultural Center on Sunday, at 2 p.m., you can join
San Francisco's Diana Shmiana and a wacky cast of characters
including Rockin' Rivka and Chef Shalom in an imaginary telethon to
raise money for tree planting in Israel. The event will include
puppetry, singing, clowning, storytelling and lots of audience
participation. It is a great way to learn about Tu B'Shvat and the
environment!</LD>
<TE>   To make reservations for this event, please call (310) 440-4636.

<HD>For Kids Who Have Everything</HD>
<DH>Not that they don't need a 27th Slinky, but some children
ask birthday party guests to give to charity rather than bring gifts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CROSS-BARNET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cameron Cooper likes big birthday parties with lots of friends--and
that means lots of presents. Maybe even too many presents.</LD>
<LD>   So for her seventh birthday in October, the West Los Angeles girl
decided to do something different. Inspired by a friend who turned
her birthday party into a fund-raiser for endangered turtles, the
animal-loving Cameron asked her guests not to bring presents.
Instead, they were encouraged to donate to the local environmental
organization Heal the Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Cameron, the nonprofit group reaped about $500 toward
its efforts to clean up the Santa Monica Bay, and the second-grader
came away with a sense of having done something important.</LD>
<TE>   "I really like the animals in the bay, and I like the water to be
clean, so that's why I did Heal the Bay," Cameron said.</TE>
<TE>   As for not getting more dolls, games or books, she was
philosophical: "I have a whole room full of toys. I don't really need
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's choice is unusual but not unique. Daniel Smith of
Collinsville, Ill., also used a birthday as an opportunity to help
others. The 8-year-old, who was born on Christmas Eve, doesn't
typically celebrate with a party. But when he turned 7, Daniel
invited friends to go bowling and asked them to skip the presents and
make a donation instead to help fight Parkinson's disease, which
afflicts several family members, including his grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it sounded like a neat idea, and he agreed he didn't
really need any more presents," said Daniel's mother, Mary Kay Smith.
"He agreed to this no-present party without blinking an eye," she
said, adding they have not yet decided how to mark Daniel's latest
birthday. "He was real proud of himself and really excited." Daniel
had decorated a box for guests to put the donations in.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel, whose friends contributed $75 to the American Parkinson
Disease Assn., knew he had made a good choice based on the response
from his grandmother, Donna Kuechle. "She just came over and gave me
a hug," Daniel said.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's and Daniel's families and others like them are finding
creative ways to challenge the assumption that birthdays and the
holiday season should be gift-giving extravaganzas.</TE>
<TE>   The notion is also being promoted by simple-living and
anti-consumerism groups like the Maryland-based Center for a New
American Dream. Since Sept. 11, there has been growing interest in
making family celebrations more meaningful and less commercial, said
Eric Brown, the center's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Birthday parties, in particular, "seem to be the bane of most
parents' existence," Brown said. "They're expensive. They get the
kids all keyed up, and they overemphasize gift giving. Parents are
trying to come up with a better way."</TE>
<TE>   The center's Web site (www.newdream.org) offers a long list of
"Tips for Raising Healthy Kids in a Commercial Culture." One
suggestion: Friends and relatives can give as a gift "several hours
of time"--to be spent as the child wishes--combined with a
contribution to a charity.</TE>
<TE>   Parental attention may be more appreciated by children than many
adults realize.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids say they wish they spent more time with their
parents," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child
psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of an overwhelming number of presents on a single day,
Butterworth suggests that many youngsters might enjoy gifts of time
in the form of coupons that they can redeem with their parents
throughout the year. It's a fun way for a child to book exclusive
time with Mom or Dad for a special activity such as a movie or a game
of miniature golf.</TE>
<TE>   For parents like Milwaukee resident Jennifer Morales, toned-down
celebrations are part of a larger project: resisting the influence of
advertising and consumer culture. Her two sons, whose July birthdays
are a week apart, have a joint birthday party in her backyard with
friends, a wading pool and a pinata--but no costly extras like pony
rides or people dressed as Disney characters.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of advertising and our very materialistic culture, we
always think that more is going to be better," said Morales, a member
of the Milwaukee School Board and former assistant director of the
Center for the Study of Commercialism in Education.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of toys, Morales encourages friends and relatives to give
her boys--Anansi, 8, and Cedro, 6--experiences they will remember and
treasure, such as taking a train ride together or visiting the zoo.
For years, the boys' grandparents have been taking them to see
children's plays at Christmastime as an alternative to presents.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to avoid what Brown, of the Center for a New American
Dream, calls "the commercialization of childhood."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, who says growing up in suburban Chicago with little money
taught her the value of thrift, finds that limiting her children's
exposure to commercials (she doesn't own a TV) means they tend not to
clamor for the latest toys. That's not to say there's never any
grumbling from her sons--or from their friends' parents, who
sometimes don't "get it," Morales said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once in a while I do get some complaints" from Anansi and Cedro,
Morales said. "But for the most part they have come to accept that
Mom has certain values and standards, and that's just the way things
are."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Morales, Ann Boehlke was reared in relative comfort in
Colorado as a doctor's daughter. But thrift was a central value in
her family, and the Venice resident tries to pass on to her three
children--ages 5, 3 and 1--the benefits of doing more with less.</TE>
<TE>   Boehlke, who admits to a quirky streak, likes to do things
differently; at her wedding, instead of gifts, she had friends
contribute pieces to her extra-long homemade wedding train.</TE>
<TE>   She tries to make birthday parties simple but fun. One year she
had guests bring food for a potluck; other times the family has gone
to theater events with a few friends. She asks people not to bring
presents, although some usually do so anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Boehlke's oldest child, Emma Polhemus, began attending
kindergarten at Edison Language Academy in Santa Monica. When Emma's
fifth birthday rolled around a few weeks later, Boehlke and her
husband, Mack Polhemus, had a thought: Instead of filling up their
apartment with more tchotchkes, why not take advantage of Emma's
birthday and do something to help the school by buying playground
equipment?</TE>
<TE>   The birthday donations helped to purchase small but useful items
including a tricycle, jump ropes and some large play balls.</TE>
<TE>   Boehlke is frank in her distaste for the clutter that birthdays
bring, and her preference for events that foster memories rather than
messes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want all that junk," she said. "You always get all this
stuff you don't need."</TE>
<TE>   Janine Jeffery, mother of Cameron, who raised money for Heal the
Bay, would agree. In the past, she said, her daughter received so
much stuff that "we ended up giving some of those things away."</TE>
<TE>   That won't be a problem this year. Cameron already has chosen a
charity for her eighth birthday party: Save the Whales.</TE>

<HD>More Cool Quarters</HD>
<DH>Part 1 Starting in 1999, new quarters began appearing--five
per year--to honor all 50 states. How did this come about?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA WALSH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shiny as silver buckles, round as the moon, new state quarters are
rolling out of the U.S. Mint and into our pockets. As the result of
the 50 State Quarters Program Act, five states a year are being
honored with a new quarter. The coins are being released in the order
by which each state joined the union, or signed the Constitution.
Starting in 1999, a new coin has been released every 10 weeks, giving
us the opportunity to learn something about each state a little at a
time. All 50 state coins will be released by 2008.</LD>
<LD>   State quarters are special because they celebrate our country and
our freedom, and remind us of the rich history, geography and
diversity of each state. Every quarter tells a story with a specially
designed picture on the "tails" side of the coin.</LD>
<LD>   State quarters are made at the Philadelphia and Denver branches of
the U.S. Mint. (Special proof coins, not made for circulation, are
produced in San Francisco.) A small mintmark of "P" or "D" can be
found on the "heads" side of the coin, which tells which mint made
the quarter. Most quarters circulating in California were made in
Denver, simply because Denver is closer to us than Philadelphia is.
It is fun to try and find coins from both mints. Because each coin is
only being made for a 10-week period, the supply is limited, making
it a challenge to collect them all.</LD>

<HD>Remember Batons? The Art Is Still in Good Hands</HD>
<DH>Once the darlings of halftime shows, twirlers are few but
dedicated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine-year-old Allison Fleming has a few tips for aspiring baton
twirlers: "Don't give up even when you can't do something. Try not to
be too rowdy. Don't be too calm because you need energy to do stuff.
And here's some other advice: Don't wear tight skirts or shoes that
can slip off. Like a gymnastics outfit would be good."</LD>
<LD>   To demonstrate the tight skirt point, Fleming, in jeans, sneakers,
tie-dye T-shirt and a light dusting of facial glitter, performs a
high kick, passing her baton under one leg. Then she feigns a tight
skirt and tries to repeat the move. It ain't happening. Point taken.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-grader is one of about half a dozen girls in Lisa
Taylor's eight-week-long intermediate baton twirling class, offered
through the city of Santa Monica. Her 6-year-old sister, Lesli, is
also in the class, which takes place once a week in the craft room of
Santa Monica's Joslyn Park. There was supposed to be a second class
for beginners. But not enough kids signed up, which isn't entirely
surprising. After all, baton twirling's popularity peaked around
1960.</LD>
<TE>   "Then there were about a million kids," recalls Don Sartell,
president of the National Baton Twirling Assn. in Janesville, Wis.,
which he founded in 1941. "There were about 20,000 school bands in
America and all had twirlers or drum majors." (The sport in fact
traces its roots to late 19th century U.S. military drum majors--all
men--who walked in front of the band, carrying large batons with
which they set the cadence.)</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was sailing along fine," Sartell says. "Then came
Title IX in the '70s, which mandated that every school give equal
opportunity to girls for sports. So many girls who were involved in
pompom, cheerleading and baton twirling got into [other] sports. High
level twirling dropped by 150,000 to 200,000 [participants]."</TE>
<TE>   Today, most high school bands don't even feature twirlers, Sartell
laments. "Band leaders have resorted to a girl carrying a flag or a
plastic or wood rifle or a pompom. In three or four weeks, they can
teach them what it takes [to master the flag, rifle or pompom]. To
put on a proficient team of baton twirlers takes many months of
training."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Sartell would be heartened if he could see the routine of
the girls practicing in Santa Monica. Casually known as the Taylor's
Twirlers, the girls perform to the Backstreet Boys' high energy song
"The Call." Over the course of class, the girls repeat the routine
half a dozen or so times. While they aren't quite ready for a
halftime show, they're awfully cute and entertaining. Instructor
Taylor, in her late 30s, who was the featured twirler at her alma
mater, the University of Central Florida, and a state twirling
champion, assists with such cues as "figure eight," "roll," "pinwheel
up and down" and "leg trap." The routine ends with optional splits.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's marching to John Phillips Sousa's Semper Fidelis.
"This is practice for those 3-mile parades," says Taylor, a database
consultant who lives in Culver City. The girls are giddy at the
parade prospect. She leads, knees high, prancing like a horse, as her
students follow her around the circumference of the room, clinging to
their batons. "Left-right, left-right," she calls out. "Try to be in
step. Get your feet up. Point your toes." After one lap, things get
more complicated. Now the challenge is to walk and twirl at the same
time. "Ow," cries out Lila Seeley, 8. "I bumped my funny bone."</TE>
<TE>   There is in fact a fair amount of bumping. The girls don't quite
have the spacing thing down. At one point, Taylor entreats, "Spread
out so you don't kill each other." There are also quite a few batons
crashing into the ceiling and sailing across the floor. But everyone
seems to be having fun, including the parents hovering in the
doorway.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it as a child, which is why I wanted my daughters to
experience it," Georgiana Fleming says. "It's a good, wholesome
activity." Adds Sammy Rae's mom, Kelley Scarborough: "It teaches
discipline. And it's something different that none of the other kids
know how to do. It makes her feel special." There's another draw as
well, says Scarborough, who points out that the twirling is far less
expensive than ice skating or basketball.</TE>
<TE>   As for the future of twirling, Sartell is enthusiastic. "It's
great. Obviously twirlers would like to see it in the Olympics one
day. But until we can get enough countries in the world up to our
level, it would be brutal. Our twirlers are still way ahead of the
rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his optimistic outlook, Sartell can't help looking back to
a particularly bright moment in the history of sport: A movie about
baton twirling that aired on NBC in 1981. "Believe it or not," he
says, "Heather Locklear was in it, Lisa Whelchel from the 'Facts of
Life,' and Erin Moran. It was called 'Twirl.' It was movie of the
week."</TE>

<DH>After news of Yves Saint Laurent's retirement, fans
scramble to buy the legendary designer's vintage fashions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after the news broke that legendary French designer Yves
Saint Laurent was retiring from the fashion business, Rita Watnick
had to unplug the phone minutes after opening her Beverly Hills
vintage salon, Lilly et Cie. Dozens of customers were clamoring for a
piece of vintage Saint Laurent haute couture or his less expensive
ready-to-wear, Rive Gauche.</LD>
<LD>   "There were people literally grabbing clothes from each other,"
she said. "It was like a long-lost sale day at Filene's Basement a
million years ago."</LD>
<LD>   Saint Laurent had been gradually withdrawing from his namesake
fashion house since handing the ready-to-wear design reins to Alber
Elbaz in 1998, though he still produced couture collections. Serious
collectors had been buying the best of Saint Laurent for years. For
casual collectors and fashion fans, however, the announcement on Jan.
7 that his last couture show will be Tuesday sparked a nerve.
Suddenly, many scrambled to own a piece of the designer's work.</LD>
<TE>   "We had maybe 500 pieces in the store last week," Watnick said.
"Now we maybe have one or two."</TE>
<TE>   Experienced couture collectors, such as author Sandy Schreier in
Southfield, Mich., expect the new attention on Saint Laurent to cause
prices to skyrocket. "I think that they will rise because his clothes
represent the 20th century and the modern woman. And because everyone
is wearing collectibles, and because wearing vintage is in. And it's
in not just for Winona Ryder, Renee Zellweger and Julia Roberts but
for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Saint Laurent's signature designs have reappeared in
current fashion, which is stimulating demand for the original looks,
even if they're not the valuable haute couture pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "Rive Gauche is going to get a real boost," said Schreier. "Saint
Laurent is hotter and hotter all the time. I think his retirement
will make it go over the top. Your average people are going to go out
and find it in resale shops and flea markets, and it will become
collectible for a new breed of collector/wearers and not just for the
serious couture collector."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time that the designer's clothes have heated up
the vintage clothing market. Watnick also saw a sudden interest in
vintage Saint Laurent when American designer Tom Ford assumed
creative control of the ready-to-wear line in 2000, shortly after the
Gucci Group acquired Rive Gauche. Watnick credits that surge to
buyers who felt "a loss of tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Interest has been strong among the hip and trendy vintage crowd.
This fall, local dealer Cameron Silver opened a special sale of
vintage Saint Laurent at Barneys New York in Manhattan, where he
operates an offshoot of his Melrose Avenue Decades boutique. Though
the sale opened on Sept. 12, Silver said, "we had one of our best
weeks ever at Barneys. The fashion world was aware that this was
their shot at getting YSL by YSL." When the retirement announcement
came, Barneys customers scooped up most of the remaining Rive Gauche
collection at $180 to $220 for a blouse and $100 to $150 for a scarf.
Prices could rise up to 25% by the end of the year, Silver estimated.</TE>
<TE>   A clearer picture of Saint Laurent's growing worth to collectors
could arrive with the May 22 couture auction at Doyle Galleries in
New York. Couture and textiles director Linda Donohue has watched,
sometimes with astonishment, as interest in and prices of vintage
clothing have surged since she started the department in 1983. "Last
spring we had a Charles Frederick Worth  dress sell for $120,000,"
she said. "Other pieces went for $50,000 to $70,000." Saint Laurent's
best couture ensembles have fetched $100,000, said Schreier, who saw
a mid-1970s peasant blouse, belt and skirt set sell for that amount
in London last year.</TE>
<TE>   Only the audience of buyers can really determine the value of
vintage Saint Laurent. "His couture will be strong," Donohue said. "I
think the Rive Gauche is a great wearable. I wouldn't suggest people
going out and buying Rive Gauche except to wear. It's great style but
not a serious collectible."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when a celebrity wears a vintage designer or a certain
look, less desirable items can gain value from the new association,
she said. As an example, the $3,000 vintage Rive Gauche safari suit
that Silver recently sold to Nicole Kidman could boost the demand and
thus the price for YSL safari looks.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Ford's spring 2002 collection reintroduced many safari
styles, which will help bring fashion relevance to the once-outdated
shirt jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Though the particular items that become collectible in the vintage
market are often susceptible to fads, Donohue is betting that wearing
vintage clothing is here to stay. "I don't think it's a fad," she
said. "It's an understanding of what's beautiful." But prices, like
fashion, are fickle, and there's a wild card in the Saint Laurent
hand: the designer himself. He didn't always keep key pieces of his
collections, Schreier said, and now he has a 2-year-old museum to
complete in Paris. On occasion she has found herself bidding against
one very interested, and deep-pocketed, buyer: the house of Saint
Laurent.</TE>

<HD>Saliva's Many Roles, From Boar Courtship to Nest-Making</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To some saliva scientists, the human fluid is the main fascination.
Others have dedicated their careers to comparing the glands of
different creatures: spiny anteaters, bats, opossums, you name it.
The glands are all so distinct, exalts Bernard Tandler, comparative
anatomist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.</LD>
<LD>   They're distinct in size: The elephant's two main glands--the
parotid glands--weigh more than 40 pounds apiece; those of little
shrews and tiny bats weigh less than one-tenth of an ounce. But
glands are also distinct in structure and function. Each creature,
Tandler says, makes saliva tailored to its own unique needs.</LD>
<LD>   The spit of a boar, for instance, contains testosterone to pique a
sow's interest when it's showered over her during courtship. The spit
of the short-tailed opossum contains chemicals used to mark its
trails and territories.</LD>
<TE>   The spit of a small bird, the swiftlet, contains a gummy glue that
sticks its nest together (and is prized in Chinese cuisine for making
bird's nest soup).</TE>
<TE>   Bats, Tandler's particular love, make hefty use of tailored
saliva. The spit of a vampire bat contains a protein--draculin--that
stops victims' blood from clotting during feeding. And many bats use
saliva to identify kin.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of a bat cave where there must be hundreds and thousands of
bat mothers giving birth at the same time--they go out foraging and
have to find Junior," says Tandler. "How do they find him? By the
characteristic odor of saliva."</TE>
<TE>   Tandler and his Texas Tech colleague Carleton Phillips have so far
examined glands of about 300 species, including 240 types of bats.
But the job is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all a unique story--every one of them," Tandler says.
"We've only scratched the surface."</TE>

<HD>Study Tracks Premature Babies</HD>
<DH>Many confront lifelong problems related to development, but
they are also less likely to indulge in risky behavior, researchers
find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANKAR VEDANTAM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Babies born prematurely continue to have neurological and
developmental problems well into early adulthood, according to the
first comprehensive study that tracked hundreds of survivors over two
decades, researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   The group also had lower IQs, more learning disabilities and
higher rates of such disorders as cerebral palsy--a sobering reminder
that while ever-larger numbers of premature babies now survive, many
may confront lifelong problems.</LD>
<LD>   But researchers also found tremendous reserves of resilience and
adaptation in the children and their families. While acknowledging
more health problems, many reported that their health and quality of
life was better than those of peers who had full-term births.</LD>
<TE>   By followings its subjects into early adulthood, the study extends
what researchers have learned about the effects of premature birth.
And in a wholly unexpected finding, researchers noted that the
premature group was less likely to indulge in risky behaviors such as
drug taking and early sex, and less likely to get into scrapes with
the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Poorer-functioning children are more susceptible to peer
pressure," said Maureen Hack, a professor of pediatrics at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, explaining why scientists
had expected more risk-taking behavior, not less. Although the
scientists aren't sure what explains the better behavior, watchful
parenting appears to be the most plausible explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there might have been more parental monitoring," said
Hack, the lead scientist on the project. "These are very special
children to the parents--they were ... expected to die. Some of the
parents didn't expect to have another child. If you have a small
preemie, you may watch over them more."</TE>
<TE>   The 242 children evaluated by the study are now young adults. They
were born after only six to eight months in the womb and weighed less
than 3.3 pounds at birth. They tended to be smaller in stature and
were less likely to finish high school than 233 comparable children
who had spent a full term in the womb. There was a clear correlation
between the extent of prematurity and the extent of disability, with
more-premature babies being more likely to show more problems later,
according to results published in Thursday's edition of the New
England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   All the children were born between 1977 and 1979 at the Rainbow
Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.</TE>

<HD>The Gland Tour: How Saliva Is Made</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have worked hard to figure out how our salivary glands
strut their stuff--both because it's interesting and because
knowledge could point the way to therapies.</LD>
<LD>   Structurally, the glands are rather like bunches of grapes. At one
end (buried in the flesh of our mouths) are those "grapes"--round
clusters of cells that secrete the water and many of the proteins and
chemicals of our spit. That saliva oozes into hollow tubes called
ducts, ever-widening tributaries that fuse with other tributaries and
eventually dump saliva into our mouths.</LD>
<LD>   There are three main pairs of glands--the parotid glands (which
are the largest and release saliva through the cheek) and the
sublingual and submandibular glands (which release fluid under the
tongue). A whole slew of minor glands also oozes fluid. While spit is
pretty much the same from gland to gland, there are differences--the
parotid gland, for instance, contains more of the enzyme amylase,
which is used to digest starch in our food. (It is the parotid that
goes into overdrive when we eat--or anticipate eating, for that
matter.)</LD>
<TE>   Saliva production is controlled by nerve signals from the brain to
the glands. Those nerves release chemicals that stick to the gland
cells and tell them to release the proteins, water and other
ingredients of spit.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of triggers--the sight or thought of a piece of
cheesecake, the taste of lemon or the simple act of chewing--send
such signals into overdrive. (Some people with dry mouth syndrome say
they try thinking of their favorite foods when they want to get their
saliva flowing.) Therapeutically, drugs that mimic the action of the
nerves' chemical signals can help boost saliva flow in many dry mouth
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Studies are also revealing why mouths dry up--though there is
still much to be learned. Some prescription medications interfere
with the nervous system's stimulation of glands. People who have had
radiotherapy for head and neck cancer accumulate damage in the
grape-like portion of the salivary glands--the part that oozes water.</TE>
<TE>   And some people's own bodies attack their glands, in a strange
autoimmune disease called Sjogren's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Sjogren's syndrome affects nine times as many women as men,
typically appears in midlife and affects production of other fluids
too (causing dry eyes, for instance). Theories about Sjogren's
syndrome are various, and changing: One hypothesis is that the body
creates antibodies that bind to the salivary gland cells--blocking
the chemical signals from the nerves.</TE>
<TE>   But there is also evidence that people with Sjogren's syndrome may
lose the special protein pores--known as aquaporins--that permit
water to flow into the ducts.</TE>

<LD>It's always pleasant to talk to someone who loves her work--and my
recent chat with Pam Dalton was no exception. Her enthusiasm was
palpable (nay, contagious) as she gaily described the easiest way to
brew up the smell of rotting meat in a lab, then moved on to talk
about her never-to-be-forgotten field trip to a pig farm.</LD>
<LD>   Dalton, a psychologist by training, was not being perverse--she's
a scholar of "odor perception" at the Monell Chemical Senses Center
in Philadelphia. (Even the military is interested in her work, with a
mind to creating a super-powerful stink bomb.) She got interested in
studying smells for a host of reasons--to find out why we like some,
why we hate others, how they affect our mood, trigger memories and
more.</LD>
<LD>   "The field was ripe for asking lots of interesting questions," she
says.</LD>
<TE>   "Ripe," too, describes the kinds of smells Dalton opted to
study--nasty, stinky ones. Her specialty is scents that waft from
putrid cheese, rotting carcasses, old drains and rancid
armpits--odors she brews up in her very own lab. To get a rotting
mouse smell, for instance, Dalton allowed a dead one she'd found in a
trap to age gently in a glass jar. But often she resorts to
analytical chemistry, combining smelly chemicals into medleys that
she tests on volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   (These lab mixes, of course, will not tell the whole sensory
story, but the concoctions will at least invoke the essence of a
smell. For instance, just one chemical--called skatole--does a very
good job of capturing that je ne sais quoi of raw sewage.)</TE>
<TE>   To do her studies, Dalton either presents people with nasty smells
on bits of filter paper or exposes them to stinks in fancy masks or
observation rooms. Then she measures their responses--asking them
questions and scoring their facial expression for that characteristic
frown of disgust. She measures breathing and heart rate (which change
when someone's disgusted). She even attaches electrodes to people's
bellies and records the telltale increase in stomach activity that
signifies the onset of nausea.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to know, says Dalton, if people are born with innate
disgust for certain odors--though it would certainly make sense, she
reasons. (Human waste has probably long been associated with
disease-causing germs.)</TE>
<TE>   But even if we do have pre-set preferences, they're very plastic,
Dalton says--depending on all kinds of factors such as memories and
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Among the things she's learned:</TE>
<TE>   * If you're constantly exposed to a smell, you're apt to stop
smelling it. (I've wondered, from time to time, why people entering
my house often wrinkle their noses and ask me if I've got cats.)
Folks back in Elizabethan times were used to pretty rancid streets
and probably wouldn't bat an eyelid at reeks that would send us
running.</TE>
<TE>   * Our aversion to a smell depends on context. People given a
cheesy smell aren't put off if they're told it's a food--they may
even start debating which fine French cheese it is. But tell them
instead that they're dealing with a bodily odor and they are apt to
think stinky feet and blanch.</TE>
<TE>   * Familiarity's important as well. One particular smell that
Dalton positively hated made a Chinese student simply shrug his
shoulders. He was used to the sulfurous, fermented odors that hung
around some of the back alleys of restaurants back home.</TE>
<TE>   And when Dalton visited South Africa, she discovered that people
there strongly disliked the smell of cinnamon--it was nothing they
used in their cooking and smelt medicinal, poisonous, weird.</TE>
<TE>   * Our smells are also tightly wrapped up with memories. Dalton
couldn't stand the smell of modeling glue for a spell: She'd been
mugged by a man who'd been using it. (She bought a tube of glue and
took whiffs of it till the association faded.) Smells may be
particularly evocative because the smell-processing parts of the
brain lie very close to those that deal with emotional memories.</TE>
<TE>   There's so much more to learn, Dalton says, and always some new,
bad odor beckoning round the corner. Her husband is used to making
detours so she can get a whiff of chicken farms, smokestacks or paper
mills.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's an odor source anywhere within 20 miles, I want to go
smell it," she says. "It's what I do. It's my professional
curiosity."</TE>

<HD>Energy Drinks, Straight Up or Mixed, Stir Debate</HD>
<DH>Experts worry about the effects on young people who may
have a false sense of security when they add the caffeine-laden
beverages to alcohol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRET CONDON</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 17, he already knows his liquor, but he's not so proud of this
that he wants his name in the newspaper. At any rate, he's convinced
that it wasn't the vodka that did him in.</LD>
<LD>   It was the mixer.</LD>
<LD>   While visiting with friends in upstate New York in late November,
he settled down in front of the TV with a cocktail made of two shots
of vodka and a can of Red Bull, a popular so-called energy drink with
a sweet, medicinal taste. Awhile later, he went to the bathroom and
passed out. He awoke after a few minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "I've had drinks like that before," says the 175-pound high school
senior from Avon, Conn., referring to the two-shot booze content. But
he'd never mixed it with Red Bull before--although he said that kids
his age do this regularly. Since then, he said, "I've heard stories
that it's bad for you."</TE>
<TE>   He can add his experience to the mountainous pile of tales, urban
legends and sketchy facts that swirl around beverages called energy
drinks--soft drinks that are usually carbonated and typically loaded
with caffeine, sugar and a grab bag of amino acids, vitamins,
minerals and herbal ingredients. Besides Red Bull, there are such
brands as Adrenaline Rush, KMX, 180 and Venom.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on alcohol use and on nutrition have concerns about these
beverages--especially when they're used with alcohol. But these same
experts say that there is no hard data suggesting that energy drinks
are harmful. In any case, there is little to support the claims that
energy drinks are healthful or provide any energy beyond their sugar
and caffeine kick.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a fad; I don't think there is an explicit danger,"
said Dwayne Proctor, assistant professor in the Department of
Community Medicine and Health Care at the University of Connecticut
Health Center and a researcher at the university's Alcohol Research
Center. Proctor said he was surprised to hear someone order a "Red
Bull and Absolut" vodka in a bar recently. The place was equipped
with a small, bar-top refrigerator just for cold cans of Red Bull.</TE>
<TE>   Market leader Red Bull, made in Austria for more than a decade,
was in the headlines this summer when three young Swedes died after
drinking the beverage. Two were mixing it with vodka and the third
guzzled it after a gym workout. Swedish officials said they're
investigating possible ill effects of booze and Bull, but they have
not banned the product.</TE>
<TE>   Emmy Cortes, director of communications for Red Bull North America
in Santa Monica, said there are no facts that suggest Red Bull caused
any of the deaths in Europe. She noted that billions of the
distinctive blue-and-silver cans have been sold around the world. The
total caffeine load per 8.3-ounce can is 80 milligrams, or about the
same as a cup of coffee from Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Like other energy drinks, Red Bull has an ingredient list that
reads like the One-a-Day vitamin label. Besides sugar, there are such
nutrients as niacin, vitamins B-6 and B-12 and pantothenic acid (a
vitamin) as well as glucuronolactone (a substance found in the body
that is part of the metabolic process).</TE>
<TE>   The drink's marquee ingredient (featured on the front of the can)
is taurine, an amino acid, which is produced naturally in the body.
(Contrary to one popular myth, the taurine in Red Bull is not
obtained from bulls' testicles.)</TE>
<TE>   Cortes said that she's well aware that Red Bull is being sold in
bars, although she said it's sold mainly in convenience stores. The
makers of Red Bull and of SoBe Adrenaline Rush take the same line
when it comes to bar sales: Energy drinks make the perfect
alternative to booze.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for the designated driver," said Kristine Hinck,
spokeswoman for South Beach Beverage Co. of Norwalk, Conn., the
operating unit of PepsiCo that makes SoBe Adrenaline Rush.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the energy drink-as-mixer that is raising eyebrows among
some people who study alcohol use and abuse. They say the
caffeine-alcohol combo could make the drinker into a drunk who is not
sleepy. He or she might drink more or might get behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "It might lull them into a false sense of security," said Dr. Marc
Bayer, medical director of the Connecticut Poison Control Center at
the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington.</TE>
<TE>   In that way, said Proctor, it's probably a lot like an Irish
coffee, which is a mix of a depressant (alcohol) and a stimulant
(caffeine).</TE>
<TE>   "The true danger would be in the perception that they're drinking
something healthy in addition to drinking something alcoholic," said
Proctor. "That perception may cause you to drink more."</TE>
<TE>   How healthful are energy drinks? One can ask the same question
about dietary supplements. Most healthy people with a varied diet
don't need them. Some supplements may even interfere with
prescription medicines. Ilene Heller, senior staff attorney at the
Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, said it's
unlikely that energy drinks contain effective doses of the few
additives that may have some scientific validity.</TE>
<TE>   The center wants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to take
action against so-called functional foods--those laced with dietary
supplements--that make misleading label claims or contain substances
such as ginkgo and echinacea that can be sold as capsules or teas,
but are not approved food additives. In the past two years, the FDA
has sent warning letters out to some functional juice and tea makers.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not yet clear whether beverages such as energy drinks are
technically foods with additives or liquid dietary supplements, which
are subject to different regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Heller says, there is no evidence that they're good
for you.</TE>
<TE>   "If consumers are taking these things thinking they're going to
get something out of them," she said, "they're mistaken."</TE>

<LD>Now that the holidays are over, adults are counting calories and
heading to the gym in droves--after all, many Americans, kids
included, are overweight. But for kids, the game plan is different.</LD>
<LD>   Kids still are growing, and they require a variety of healthy
foods. Drastic dieting is not recommended, because it deprives a
young body of nutritional needs. But that doesn't mean kids should
sit on the couch eating chips.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids have to eat smart," says Dr. Byron Patterson, director of
the pediatric sports medicine division at UCLA. "Try to eliminate
junk foods and have a lot of fruits and vegetables."</LD>
<TE>   Sodas, candy, pastries and chips may taste good, but they provide
only empty calories--meaning they fill you up but don't provide
nutrients to help you grow. Too much of their fat and sugar, combined
with too little exercise, can create a lifelong battle with weight.</TE>
<TE>   Physical inactivity and unhealthy eating can cause serious
problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, down the road.</TE>
<TE>   One important tool in becoming healthy is to get moving. Patterson
recommends that kids try to find a form of exercise they enjoy,
whether it's a team sport, karate, dancing, biking or just taking a
walk with parents. He says that, ideally, exercise should be a
pleasant habit, rather than a difficult chore. (And don't forget to
drink water while working out.)</TE>
<TE>   "Working out and exercise should be fun, part of one's daily
life," says Patterson, adding that kids never should do activities
that cause pain or discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   Kids who think they are overweight can talk with a doctor or
nutritionist about safe ways to reduce. For some people, such as
pre-teens and teens who get taller, the weight problem goes away on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, kids will grow into their bodies," Patterson
says.</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, focus on healthy eating and being more active.</TE>

<HD>Donors Rebound Quickly After Giving Up a Kidney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN MEGAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Get a new kidney and you will be poked, prodded, inspected and
detected for the rest of your life.</LD>
<LD>   But give a kidney and chances are you will walk out of the
hospital and--except for a few postoperative checkups--no one will
follow your progress for long. That's because kidney donors generally
do very well after the operation.</LD>
<LD>   Take David Bocchichio of Unionville, Conn. Eight weeks after he
donated one of his two kidneys, he was racing a mountain bike in
downhill slalom competitions.</LD>
<TE>   Or Jan Voland of Plainfield, Conn. She was on a stationary bicycle
three weeks after she donated a kidney and within months was running
and walking four miles a day.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study backs up their positive experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Bogetti-Dumlao, the transplant coordinator for California
Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, followed up with 62 living
donors and found that 12 months after donating a kidney, 82% of
donors perceived their health to be about the same as it had been
before.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 9% of the donors felt that their health was somewhat
better than before donation, and 2% felt it was much better than
before; while 7% said their health had declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Living donors were asking me the big question: 'How is my health
going to be affected afterward?'" said Bogetti-Dumlao. She conducted
the study, which was published in the June issue of Progress in
Transplantation, out of "a desire to give them the right
information."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Drouin, a kidney transplant coordinator for Hartford
Transplant Program, said she believes it would be useful to track
donors so that potential donors have all the information they need.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain personalities want to know if they have a 5% chance of
this or a 10% chance of that," Drouin said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Drouin said she thought it might be difficult to have a
long-term tracking project for donors because they are usually so
well, they may not want to be bothered with filling out
questionnaires or going for bloodwork as part of a follow-up study.</TE>
<TE>   Bogetti-Dumlao said she would like to see a registry that follows
donors for a lifetime, in the same way that recipients are tracked.</TE>
<TE>   All the kidney donors included in her study scored better than the
general population on a standardized health questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   "These results support the theory that living-kidney donation does
not impact the donor's health negatively," Bogetti-Dumlao said.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, unrelated donors scored higher than the related
donors in the vitality category. "Although this comparison is not
statistically significant, the finding is supported by the theory
that living, unrelated donation is motivated by altruism," she wrote
in her report.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest scores in the vitality category went to distant
relatives who had donated kidneys. Bogetti-Dumlao wrote that if the
donation was "done due to pressure from the family or feelings of
obligation, donors could perceive their health as lower than the norm
after donation."</TE>
<TE>   Bogetti-Dumlao also noted that many donors said they would have
appreciated more follow-up: perhaps checkups with a nephrologist or
more emotional support from the transplant team.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some donors probably wouldn't have sought any extra
medical attention. Bocchichio, a physical education teacher at the
Hockanum School in East Hartford, was the subject of much publicity
last year--including an appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show"--when
he donated a kidney to Evelyn Arroyo, the mother of three of his
former students.</TE>
<TE>   Bocchichio, now 26, donated the kidney early in the year and
returned to his job teaching within six weeks of the surgery. After
the first week or two when he was in a lot of pain, Bocchichio said,
he felt better and better and now feels completely healed from the
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Of far greater concern to him are injuries he sustained over the
summer when he crashed while mountain biking: broken ribs and a
separated shoulder. Asked whether doctors approved of mountain biking
so soon after the organ donation, Bocchichio said: "I don't listen to
doctors very much."</TE>
<TE>   Voland, 47, who donated a kidney to her younger brother, Mike
Parisella, in October 2000, said, "I'm back to normal. I can do
anything I choose to do."</TE>
<TE>   Voland said she does still have a slight pulling feeling in the
area where the incision was made through seven layers of muscle. She
expects, though, that within the next six months that sense of
pulling will vanish.</TE>
<TE>   A coach at Plainfield High School, Voland went back to coaching
basketball in January of this year and then onto coaching softball in
the spring. The softball particularly helped her recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was swinging that bat, I started to feel better," Voland
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was a little surprised at how little follow-up was
involved for a donor. After the checkup one month after the
operation, it was like, "Thank you, see ya." It was very different
than before the surgery, when so many questions were asked, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Barrows, 41, of East Hartford, gave a kidney to a recipient
he did not know beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   Barrows, who works as a receptionist at the state Department of
Children and Families, called Drouin almost four years ago and said
he wanted to provide a kidney to someone who needed one.</TE>
<TE>   Drouin eventually matched Barrows with Jose Spivey, then 12. The
transplant was in July 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Barrows, who is blind, said that just three months after surgery
he went on a rigorous, eight-mile hike. "It was a little
uncomfortable but doable." Now, three years later, Barrows said, "I
have no pain, no discomfort. Unless I purposely feel where the
incisions were, I can't even feel where I had surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Barrows said the surgery "should not be taken lightly," but it is
"worth every bit of the discomfort to see your recipient thriving."</TE>

<LD>Living-kidney donations have more than doubled in the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, 5,293 Americans donated a kidney, accounting for more
than a third of the 13,372 kidney transplants across the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   As of November, about 50,000 Americans were on a waiting list for
a kidney.</LD>
<TE>   The waiting period for a kidney from a cadaver can run two to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Most transplant centers have a waiting list that is two to five
times the number of transplants they do each year.</TE>

Foundation at (800) 622-9010.</TE>

<TE>   Happiness With Stay Is Linked to Recovery</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to helping people get well, a little TLC can be just
as important as the right medications and proper medical procedures,
a Harvard Medical School study has found.</TE>
<TE>   After their discharge, 1,300 heart attack patients were polled
about their hospital stay.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers asked if their preferences were respected, if their
friends and families were kept up to speed about their condition, and
if they received emotional support, adequate pain control, sufficient
information about their illness and coordinated care from the
hospital staff.</TE>
<TE>   One month later, patients who had a worse hospital experience were
in poorer health than those who said their experience was positive.
This same observation held true even a year later.</TE>
<TE>   The bright spot is that negative consequences of an unpleasant
hospital stay could be offset by good quality follow-up care.
Patients who had a bad experience in the hospital but satisfactory
care afterward enjoyed the same good health as those who were happy
with their care all along.</TE>

<TE>   ASPIRIN</TE>
<TE>   Product Targets Heart Disease, Osteoporosis</TE>
<TE>   As women age, they're often advised to take a daily dose of
aspirin, especially if they're at high risk for heart disease, the
No. 1 killer of women. They also need to make sure they get enough
calcium to avoid osteoporosis. Now it may be easier to do both.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Women's Aspirin Plus Calcium, targeted to postmenopausal
women, provides 81 milligrams of aspirin, the lowest dose considered
effective for prevention of heart attacks. It combines that with 300
milligrams of calcium, about one-quarter to one-fifth of the calcium
an older woman needs each day to keep her bones strong--equivalent to
what she'd get from a glass of milk.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Debra R. Judelson, a Beverly Hills cardiologist, has been
speaking out for years about the need for such a product and welcomed
it. It's the first of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see women responding to the need to take aspirin to
reduce their risk for heart disease," said Judelson, who is among the
authors of the American Heart Assn. and American College of
Cardiology guide to preventive cardiology for women.</TE>
<TE>   "It enables me to roll my messages together and hit home with
people. This is something they need to be using."</TE>

<LD>As women age, they're often advised to take a daily dose of aspirin,
especially if they're at high risk for heart disease, the No. 1
killer of women. They also need to make sure they get enough calcium
to avoid osteoporosis. Now it may be easier to do both.</LD>
<LD>   Bayer Women's Aspirin Plus Calcium, targeted to postmenopausal
women, provides 81 milligrams of aspirin, the lowest dose considered
effective for prevention of heart attacks. It combines that with 300
milligrams of calcium, about one-quarter to one-fifth of the calcium
an older woman needs each day to keep her bones strong--equivalent to
what she'd get from a glass of milk.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Debra R. Judelson, a Beverly Hills cardiologist, has been
speaking out for years about the need for such a product and welcomed
it. It's the first of its kind.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't see women responding to the need to take aspirin to
reduce their risk for heart disease," said Judelson, who is among the
authors of the American Heart Assn. and American College of
Cardiology guide to preventive cardiology for women.</TE>
<TE>   "It enables me to roll my messages together and hit home with
people. This is something they need to be using."</TE>

<HD>Brain Scans May Anticipate MS</HD>
<DH>A British study finds MRIs provide clues about whether a
patient will develop multiple sclerosis. Drug therapy might then keep
the disorder at bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA A. JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MRI brain scans can help doctors predict whether people with possible
early signs of multiple sclerosis will develop the central nervous
system disorder and how severe it will be, a British study concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Until a few years ago, doctors did not officially diagnose MS or
start treatment until patients had two episodes of nerve problems in
different parts of the body--flare-ups that could come many years
apart while damage accumulated.</LD>
<LD>   Now, researchers at the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery in London say they have proved that magnetic resonance
imaging of patients' brains can detect damage around nerve fibers in
nearly all of those who eventually develop MS.</LD>
<TE>   The study was reported in last Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "It adds to the impetus to put people on drugs early," rather than
waiting years for a definitive diagnosis, said Dr. Stuart D. Cook, an
MS researcher, professor of neuroscience and president of the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Recent research has found that putting patients on MS drugs at the
first sign of nerve inflammation can sharply cut the chances of
developing the disorder within a few years, and the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society now recommends doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Cook said researchers still must prove that starting treatment
early limits damage for decades, not just a few years. That will
probably take 10 to 15 more years of following patients, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first drugs to cut the severity and frequency of MS attacks
were not available until a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, believed to be
caused by immune cells attacking the protective myelin sheath
surrounding nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Initially, the
body can repair the damage, but over time the nerves become scarred
and stop transmitting signals.</TE>
<TE>   Some people merely suffer mild, intermittent symptoms for decades,
while others steadily worsen, becoming blind or paralyzed or even
dying from related infections.</TE>
<TE>   Diagnosis is difficult, because initial symptoms, such as
numbness, muscle weakness or visual disturbances are temporary and
can have other causes.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers led by Dr. David H. Miller, a neurologist at the
London hospital, gave periodic MRIs to 71 patients followed for 14
years on average.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who had damaged nerve fibers on the initial MRI, 44 of
50, or 88%, developed MS; five of the remaining six had signs that
they also had developed it. Of the 21 patients whose initial MRIs
were normal but who had possible MS symptoms, 19% developed it.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that patients who had more nerve damage
generally developed more severe MS symptoms.</TE>

<LD>Question: As of Jan. 1, I've become a very active 35-year-old woman.
I'm trying to lose about 15 pounds. I have been doing aerobic
exercises for an hour every day--either running at lunch or riding a
stationary bike after work.</LD>
<LD>   Since I started these exercises, my clothes are looser, but the
scales say I've gained weight.</LD>
<LD>   Can you tell me why? (I'm a strict vegetarian, so I don't eat
animal or dairy products.)</LD>
<TE>   SUE KLINGER</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It sounds as if you have a great new exercise routine and
a healthy eating plan, so don't worry about the scales. You are
transforming your body composition--building lean body mass and
decreasing your body-fat content.</TE>
<TE>   Pound for pound, muscle takes up less space than fat, so you can
actually lose fat and inches without losing weight. Don't fixate on
the number on the scale.</TE>
<TE>   That's easier said than done, of course, because every woman I
know weighs herself.</TE>
<TE>   You could consider buying one of the new scales that provide
information on everything from body fat to weight and body mass index
ratios.</TE>
<TE>   A woman your age should aim for about 22% body fat. Below 18%, and
you could be at risk for amenorrhea (absent periods) or osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   Also, because you're a vegetarian, be sure you're getting enough
protein and essential fatty acids into your diet.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six California health plans announced last week that they would begin
to rate hospitals and doctors on various measures, such as how
"satisfied" patients are with their doctors, and publish the results.
This type of information should be helpful to consumers as they try
to navigate the murky world of health insurance to make informed
decisions. Meantime, some health plans already are making an effort
to do a better job of explaining their services. Here are a few of
them:</LD>
<LD>   Aetna Navigator</LD>
<LD>   www.aetna.com/MemberPublic/index.jsp</LD>
<TE>   The Navigator is meant as an all-purpose resource for both Aetna
U.S. Healthcare clients and the general public. Aetna members can,
for instance, switch primary-care doctors online, refill
prescriptions or replace a lost ID card. Consumers can read about
dozens of Aetna insurance plans available, check whether their doctor
is in a plan, and explore InteliHealth, Aetna's online consumer
health information company affiliated with Harvard Medical School and
the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. What's
lacking is a straight rundown of the insurance plans themselves, in
plain language. Granted, specific policy information can be
simplified only so much. Aetna has about a dozen different medical
plans in the Los Angeles area alone, but the descriptions leave
something to be desired: "Members who coordinate care through their
PCP and obtain referrals to network providers pay a minimum
co-payment ... can self-refer to a network doctor or hospital at a
higher co-payment ... [or] seek care outside the Aetna U.S.
Healthcare HMO provider network without a referral, subject to a
deductible and coinsurance." This may be clear--if you're in the
health benefits business. The rest of us could use a more basic
explanation, without the policy mumbo jumbo.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California</TE>
<TE>   www.bluecrossca.com</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Cross site seems largely designed as a marketing vehicle
and has none of the range or depth of consumer information available
on other sites. Its "Resources" section, for instance, amounts to
little more than a list of online links to government agencies and
professional organizations. But you'll also find here a feature
called "How to Choose a Plan," which is somewhat helpful. After
working through the ad copy, you will find a few "decision points,"
which at least get you thinking about the differences among policies.
For example, one says, "I need a more affordable plan with lower
monthly premiums"; in this case the site recommends a product called
PlanScape. Blue Cross also posts a sample case: a San Diego family
with a 19-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son whose coverage and
premiums are described. This is helpful, too, insofar as it gets
consumers actually working out what specific plans will mean for
them.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield of California</TE>
<TE>   www.mylifepath.com</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield's site has won awards for providing members with good,
readable and relevant information on nutrition, fitness, prevention,
as well as a library of helpful articles on illnesses and conditions.
But the value here for those investigating health insurance are the
Frequently Asked Questions pages for individual and group plans.
These are good questions: What is the best plan for me? What kinds of
plans do you offer? What is the difference between an HMO and a PPO?
The answers are often refreshingly blunt and clear. But, here again,
the company falls short in providing detailed examples to illustrate
exactly what different policies mean for different people.</TE>

<HD>Getting the Story Straight: Posture Isn't Just About
Stature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB CONDOR</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Utter the word "posture." Then watch most people instinctively yank
their shoulders back. They puff out their chests, lock the knees and
go as ramrod straight as possible. And they probably think about a
parent or teacher who once admonished them about slouching.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Wayne doesn't do any such things. He winces. And most
certainly doesn't repeat the word. "Talking to someone about posture
can be insulting," said Wayne, a personal trainer and owner of the
Fitness Companion workout studio in Chicago. "Most people know they
would benefit from improved posture. Calling attention to it can put
them on the defensive."</LD>
<LD>   What's more, posture is probably the most misunderstood word of
fitness. We think of posture as something we don't do right. It
doesn't occur to most of us that posture could change our bodies and
our lives.</LD>
<TE>   "Posture is empowering," said Jim Lal-Tabak, a yoga teacher who
conducts classes in the Chicago area. "I have one student, a woman,
who regularly ran 30 floors of stairs in her building. But she was
always hunched over, sort of closed. She started taking classes and
two years later seems like she grew 3 inches. She got a new
hairstyle. Her life is different."</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, we can improve our posture at any life stage. It's
never too late. "Even patients with mild osteoporosis [a
bone-degenerative condition that can lead to deformity] can make
dramatic improvements with series of posture exercises," said Dr.
Pauline Camacho, director of Loyola University's Osteoporosis and
Metabolic Bone Disease Center.</TE>
<TE>   One exercise she recommends is the midback posture correction. To
do it, sit on a chair with your chin in but not up. Keep the stomach
tight, chest forward and feet together flat on the floor. Place your
arms in a "W" position with the shoulders relaxed, not hunched and
the elbows bent. Bring the elbows back, gently pinching the shoulder
blades together. Hold for a slow count of 1-2-3, then relax for a
slow count of 1-2-3.</TE>
<TE>   Start with three repetitions every day, Camacho said, and
gradually work your way to two sets of 10 each day. She recommends
visiting the National Osteoporosis Foundation at www.nof.org for
information and suggested exercises. Wayne said the best posture
exercises to help anyone's alignment focus on the middle or center
back and the lower abdominal muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are contracting their upper chest and lower back
muscles whether they are lifting weights or hunched over a computer,"
Wayne said. "If you make time for posture work, you can't help but
feel more erect." Wayne isn't asking for much time. He routinely
suggests shoulder rotations to his clients. It is a three-step
exercise that takes seconds. First, feel for the bony protrusions at
the top of your shoulders; raise them up slightly. Second, gently
bring the shoulder blades toward each other. Third, drop the back
slowly a half-inch to an inch total.</TE>
<TE>   "You want smooth, gentle movement," said Wayne. "No yanking,
pulling or jerking your shoulders back." Physical therapists, yoga
teachers, dance instructors and personal trainers who focus on
posture have long recommended imagining the crown of your head or
breastbone is attached to a string on the ceiling. Proper posture
keeps that string straight but not overly taut. Wayne said that image
is a good one but might be difficult to follow while walking,
especially if we are moving briskly to make a train or appointment.
His alternative is to keep your earlobes squared with those bony
protrusions at the top of the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, pausing to be aware of your posture will serve you
fruitfully during times of stress. Wayne said that getting up from
your computer work or other activity every 20 minutes will do wonders
for your energy level.</TE>
<TE>   There are some myths about proper posture. For instance, it's
probable your grade school teacher was wrong about sitting up
straight. Rather than concentrate on making the spine erect, physical
therapist Jodi Skrzypek said, we should have a small curve forward in
the lower back and keep the shoulders lined up with the ears and
hips.</TE>
<TE>   Standing requires a similar relaxed yet efficient position that
doesn't overstress the muscles or joints. "It's certainly not about
balancing a book on your head," said Skrzypek, who is part of the
outpatient physical therapy department at Rush-Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. "When you stand, always keep a
slight bend in the knees. Be aware of when you stand for a long
period. You can avoid too much tension on the knees by placing one
foot up on a step."</TE>
<TE>   Skrzypek said she regularly works with people to avoid the
"middle-age effect" of back, neck and shoulder pain. Leaning forward
at the computer and slouching while driving or surfing the Internet
are behaviors she gently nudges patients to avoid. She said a rolled
towel on the back while driving or sitting at your desk can help
avoid discomfort while reminding you to keep your ears, shoulders and
hips aligned.</TE>
<TE>   Daily Stretches</TE>
<TE>   Another effective strategy for maintaining healthy posture is
daily stretches for the hamstring (back of the thigh) and hip flexor
muscles. Skrzypek favors a wall slide in which your back and buttocks
are flat against the wall and feet a few inches away. Tuck in your
chin so your head is as close to the wall as possible. Flatten your
stomach, then slide up and down the wall. Keep your back and stomach
flat while bending the knees and never go lower than a 90-degree
angle (which might be too far at first for some beginners).</TE>
<TE>   Taking a yoga class is bound to improve your posture. Lal-Tabak
teaches hatha yoga, which can be characterized as gentler than some
forms (such as ashtanga or power yoga) and is a good version for
novices.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Wayne said several of his clients have referred
daughters, sons or spouses to him because of poor posture. Sometimes
the loved ones in your life recognize your inevitable hunch or slouch
long before you ever will. "Your attitude about life reflects through
posture," Wayne said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just ask people you trust. They will tell you. Improving your
posture will give you a boost of confidence in a short time."</TE>
<TE>   Preventing a Humped Back</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario of bad posture is what doctors call
kyphosis, or a humped back. It is a gradually occurring deformity
that begins with weakened abdominal muscles and declining posture or
stature.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor posture is often overlooked by physicians," said Camacho, of
the Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Disease Center. "I have seen
80-year-olds who have lost so much height but only in the last year
were sent for bone-density tests."</TE>
<TE>   Early detection can avoid big problems, she said. "When I compare
two people with osteoporosis"--a bone-density loss that affects more
women under 65 and men and women equally in later years--"the one
with good posture won't get the deformity."</TE>
<TE>   Kyphosis typically occurs when the rectangular-shaped spinal
vertebrae collapse from fracture in the front or back of the bone.
The results are wedge-shaped vertebrae. The spine compresses
together, and the hump develops. Once the vertebrae reach the
collapsing fracture stage, it is difficult to reverse the condition
with exercise or medications.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors recommend weight-bearing exercises (except when
osteoporosis is so severe the workout itself will cause fractures)
plus calcium and vitamin D supplements for anyone with early symptoms
or a family history of osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   One promising trend is the emergence of vertebroplasty, an
outpatient procedure in which special body cement is injected into
the vertebrae to reinforce the bone and avoid future collapsed
vertebrae. The procedure has up to now been more closely linked to
patients with severe fractures. Camacho said it could be used to help
at earlier stages of osteoporosis and prevent years of chronic pain
for some people. It is not used for people with disc disease but
holds great potential, especially for the 25% of American women older
than 50 who will suffer spinal fractures.</TE>

<HD>The Wonders of Saliva</HD>
<DH>It protects our teeth, fights infection and is sorely
missed when absent. Scientists are fascinated by its medical
potential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES MEDICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saliva is a humdrum liquid, the stuff of giggles, dribbles and
schoolyard grossness. It's hardly something to take seriously--until,
that is, you lack it. When your glands no longer pump out a normal
and robust 2 to 3 pints daily, then you'll come to appreciate spit
for the wondrous substance it is--one that does far more than render
food slimy and digestible.</LD>
<LD>   Saliva, science has revealed, is much more than water. It is
packed with proteins that help control the teeming hordes of microbes
in our mouths. It is stuffed with substances that make our spit
stringy, stop our teeth from dissolving and help heal wounds. It is
brimming with a plethora of hormones and other chemicals revealing
anything from whether one smokes to whether one is stressed.</LD>
<LD>   Thus it's no wonder that trouble starts brewing when mouths dry
out. Cavities blossom like flowers in spring. Tongues become sore and
fissured, and breeding grounds for yeast. In a spit-depleted world,
speaking and swallowing are challenges, eating a cracker is the
height of recklessness and you wake up with your tongue glued to your
mouth.</LD>
<TE>   Such indignities will be more frequent in future years because the
number of saliva-depleted people stands to rise, experts predict.
Tens of thousands of Americans receive radiotherapy for head and neck
cancers each year--a treatment that can permanently damage salivary
glands. Maybe a million have dry mouths because their immune systems
are attacking their own glands in a disease known as Sjogren's
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   But an increasing number of people (25 million by some estimates,
and more to come as the population ages) get dry mouths as a side
effect of more than 400 of today's medications--taken for depression,
high blood pressure and more.</TE>
<TE>   A small band of scientists is fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a deep knowledge of saliva gleaned over decades, this
cadre--which jocularly refers to itself as the "salivation army"--is
working to create better artificial salivas to keep mouths wet and
protected and find new drugs to help saliva flow more freely. They're
trying to repair salivary glands with gene therapy--even to build an
artificial gland to implant in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   And their vision goes far beyond simply mending the mouth. Just as
leech saliva gave us anticoagulants, researchers hope that our very
own spit may yield new antimicrobial drugs to help battle germs. Or
that sick people's salivary glands can one day be coaxed to make
hormones that are needed for their bodies to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "The field's quite exciting--we're entering a new phase," says
Lawrence Tabak, a longtime saliva scientist and director of the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. "People are
trying to translate what they've learned from nature into things that
are going to improve patients' health. To me, that's the most
exciting thing possible--to take these great, basic science
discoveries and translate them into tangibles."</TE>
<TE>   Tangible breakthroughs on the saliva front can't come too soon for
Nancy Ross-Flanigan, 52, a Detroit area writer who's been pretty much
spitless for 11 years, ever since her salivary glands were blitzed
during radiotherapy for tongue cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, she says, prepared her for just how dry things would be.</TE>
<TE>   "I just assumed--well, everybody has dry mouth when they get
nervous or something--that's what I thought it would be like," she
says. "That you could still talk. You could still eat. You wouldn't
have to be putting something in your mouth all the time to have any
moisture."</TE>
<TE>   But her mouth ended up so dry it wouldn't yield spit even when
doctors tried milking her glands with a suction cup stuck inside her
cheek. Unless she sipped water every few minutes, her mouth gummed
up, her throat got scratchy, she croaked, and then she choked. Life's
most humdrum events became tinged with new drama.</TE>
<TE>   She learned to favor slimy pastas and soups after a series of
spectacular restaurant choking incidents--and a time, on a lunch
date, when a wad of bread wedged fast under her lip, bulging it out
like a chipmunk's cheek.</TE>
<TE>   She experimented with a long stream of over-the-counter mouth
moisturizers that her friends jocularly referred to as "I Can't
Believe It's Not Saliva!" She tried a drug to stimulate her glands.
It left her saliva flow almost unchanged but sent other bodily
secretions into overdrive, drenching her with sweat in the grocery
store or office.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ross-Flanigan uses over-the-counter pills that coat her
mouth with slime--but mostly she just totes water everywhere. She
carries it in sundry bottles, plastic jugs and on a pouch on her back
when she rides out (not quite as wild and free as she'd like) on her
Harley motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   It is far from ideal. Water isn't slick like saliva, so her mouth
gets dry and sore. Sinister scenarios color her fantasies of overseas
travel: "I think, 'Gee, what if I get captured by terrorists and they
won't let me have my spit bottle?'"</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, she says, she just feels plain dorky. Like the time
she went backstage to meet her rock idol, Joe Cocker. There she was,
dressed to the sexy nines in spandex skirt, slinky top, strappy
shoes--accessorized by a giant, red, plastic picnic jug.</TE>
<TE>   Few people suffering from dry mouth are quite as desiccated as
Ross-Flanigan. But they can still run into nasty trouble, says saliva
expert Mahvash Navazesh, associate professor and chairwoman for oral
medicine and oral diagnosis at USC's school of dentistry (and
possibly the only person to possess a plush teddy bear with "spit
queen" inscribed on it).</TE>
<TE>   She holds up slide after slide depicting only too clearly what she
means--raw tongues white with yeast, teeth brown or black with decay
on their ridges as well as at or under the gumline, where decay is
usually rare.</TE>
<TE>   If only, she says, more dentists and doctors had saliva at least
somewhat on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people are paying enough attention," she says.
"Because of that, dentists are usually doing damage control. They are
treating dental problems rather than preventing them."</TE>
<TE>   Early Diagnosis Can Mean Saving One's Teeth</TE>
<TE>   To Navazesh's mind, the first part of paying attention is
measuring saliva flow properly so you know if there's a lack--and she
is an expert at that, demonstrating her craft one morning on a
well-dressed, middle-aged woman who has been referred to USC with a
suspected saliva shortage.</TE>
<TE>   At Navazesh's request, the patient sits in the dentist's chair,
head tilted upward, eyes open, and drools into a tube for five
minutes. Next she chews gum for five minutes in time with the click
of a metronome--and spits into a second tube. Finally, she sucks a
lemon candy (again in time with the metronome) and spits into tube
No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The tubes are weighed--the first holding a dribble, the second an
inch, the third nearly two--and saliva output calculated. Finally,
the verdict is delivered: The patient's flow is on the low side and
could indicate an early stage of Sjogren's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Diagnosis is crucial, experts say, because there are things
patients and dentists must do to fight rampant tooth decay. Stringent
oral hygiene is key--brushing and flossing after every meal, daily
application of fluoride gels, monthly tooth-cleaning appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have gone around the world four times on the money I've
spent on my teeth," says art teacher and Lakewood resident Ruth
Eyrich. Her Sjogren's syndrome was diagnosed in 1985 after her
dentist found more than 14 cavities on one tooth and asked her what
the dickens she'd been doing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite monthly visits to the hygienist and everyone's best
efforts, she says, her teeth have slowly crumbled over the
years--through a long procession of fillings, crowns, root canals,
bridges and 13 dental implants. She pores over the pages of "The
Moisture Seekers," a Sjogren's newsletter, and hopes one day she'll
read of a big breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't come yet.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, along with diagnosis and care, a third line of attack is
needed to help the dry mouth brigade--one that's been sorely
neglected, say scientists. Better therapies.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my patients are suffering--there's no good answer for
them," says Nelson Rhodus, director of the Oral Medicine and
Xerostomia Clinic at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies continue to neglect the dry mouth arena, he says,
because they don't see much money in it. And today's
gland-stimulating drugs can only help people with glands left to
stimulate.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial salivas, unimpressively, have fared no better than tap
water in most clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   It's time, experts say, to bring more science to bear.</TE>
<TE>   A Relatively Recent History of Study</TE>
<TE>   Saliva science kicked off relatively late in the history of
medicine, recounts Irwin Mandel, grand old man in saliva research and
somewhat of a historian on salivary matters.</TE>
<TE>   Centuries before Mandel got his hands wet in the lab, physicians
thought the salivary glands were lowly excretory organs--ridding the
body of toxins and evil spirits from the brain. They would dose
patients with poisonous bichloride of mercury, causing saliva to pour
from the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the last century, scientists only got serious with saliva
well after they'd tackled other bodily fluids like blood.</TE>
<TE>   ("Saliva doesn't have the drama of blood, it doesn't have the
integrity of sweat, it doesn't have the emotional appeal of tears,"
says Mandel, a professor emeritus of Columbia University.)</TE>
<TE>   But from the '50s onward, Mandel and a handful of others have
established that human saliva is filled with hundreds of useful
chemicals, floating around with millions of bacteria, viruses, yeast
and skin cells in what Mandel terms a "chowder." They've been busily
investigating such proteins--and finding that some are important for
maintaining oral health.</TE>
<TE>   There are long, sticky and stretchy proteins called mucins that
are studded all over with carbohydrates, giving saliva its
stringiness so it nicely coats the teeth and gums. Mucins are a royal
pain to study, says Paul Denny, a saliva molecular biologist at USC.
("They stick to everything," he says with a sigh.) But they're worth
it.</TE>
<TE>   Studies from various labs suggest that mucins do more than form a
physical barrier protecting the teeth. They also stick to bacteria
that cause tooth decay and gum disease, interfering with their
ability to colonize teeth, and helping our immune cells attack them.</TE>
<TE>   And mucins are just the tip of the iceberg. Other proteins--with
names like peroxidase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and histatin--as well as
our own antibodies also wreak havoc on bacteria and fungi.</TE>
<TE>   Some salivary proteins, such as one fondly referred to as
"slippy," hasten the healing of wounds. Some ("slippy" again, among
others) neutralize viruses like HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Others keep saliva super-loaded with calcium and phosphorus, the
stuff of tooth enamel, so these minerals don't leach from teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "If saliva were water, we would have little stumps of teeth or no
teeth at all by age 20--we would have dissolved our teeth away," says
Frank Oppenheim, chairman of the department of periodontology and
oral biology at Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these proteins have been studied in small trials--such as
the histatins, long Oppenheim's passion, which inhibit the growth of
yeast and bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   In one histatin study, beagles were first brought to the heights
of oral health by rigorous daily toothbrushing. Then, for 42 days,
they ate a diet causing plaque buildup, and either received histatins
in an oral gel or the gel alone. At the study's end, those given
histatins had developed less gum inflammation and plaque than the
other group.</TE>
<TE>   In another trial, 159 healthy humans refrained from brushing their
teeth for four weeks. Yet again, those using a mouth rinse containing
a portion of the histatin protein developed less plaque and gum
inflammation than those who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, a Pittsburgh company, Demegen, is developing a histatin
mouth rinse--one that could be used to fight oral yeast infections in
people with faulty immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   But some researchers hope that knowledge of spit proteins could
improve the quality of artificial salivas--both in terms of texture
and cavity-fighting clout. Today's faux salivas usually contain a
synthetic thickening chemical--but it makes the fake fluids too
thick, says Rhodus. ("If people have cotton-mouth to begin with,
using this stuff is like putting glue in there.")</TE>
<TE>   With both types of improvements in mind, Dutch scientists, among
others, are busy testing sundry fake salivas seasoned with this or
that microbe-fighting protein. They've developed fake salivas
containing synthetic gums or mucins harvested from pig stomach, which
are appreciated for their slithery feel.</TE>
<TE>   But it's tough to create anything close to a fluid that's been
fine-tuned through millions of years of evolution, says Arie van
Nieuw Amerongen of the Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam.
The pig mucins, for instance, are sticky enough but just aren't
stretchy enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Hardly anybody thinks about spit. But when they miss it, they see
how many properties it has--and how difficult it is to mimic," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Rats: Gene Therapy Is Still a Long Way Off</TE>
<TE>   Instead of mimicking saliva, some scientists want to fix the
faucet and get fluid flowing again, using gene therapy. Ross-Flanigan
has heard of that: She's even got some clippings about it in her
"saliva" file. She'd do it in a flash if she thought it would work.</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, only rats have really had their dry mouths cured,
says Bruce Baum, chief of the gene therapy and therapeutics branch of
the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.</TE>
<TE>   The rats (whose glands were first destroyed with irradiation)
didn't grow spanking-new glands. Instead, tissues that don't normally
ooze fluid were genetically changed into oozers.</TE>
<TE>   The approach: infecting those watertight tissues with a harmless
virus carrying a special gene, called aquaporin. Aquaporin directs
the formation of a protein that muscles its way into the membrane and
forms a pore through which water can pass.</TE>
<TE>   Rats may be curable, but Ross-Flanigan won't be able to get the
blitzed remains of her glands studded with water pores any time soon.
The strategy hasn't yet been shown effective in pigs and primates,
let alone tested in human trials.</TE>
<TE>   Gene therapy, in any case, isn't the only saliva science exciting
Baum. His group is also working hard on an artificial gland--one that
would be built from scratch out of skin cells engineered to ooze
fluids. The cells would be coaxed to grow on a biodegradable tube
that would then be implanted in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Baum and an Alameda biotech company, Genteric Inc., are also
excited at the thought that salivary glands can be used as little
factories. The glands, both point out, don't just ooze fluid and
proteins into the mouth. They ooze them into our blood.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while you could certainly add genes to improve the quality
of someone's saliva, you could also add genes that would help supply
hormones for the rest of the body: growth hormone, insulin, you name
it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, says Tabak, you can dream on and on about stuff one can
do with this lowly fluid and the glands that make it. Maybe one day
scientists will find a salivary gland stem cell and build whole new
glands from scratch. Maybe one day all those hormones that are
floating around in our spit will allow engineers to build tiny
sensing devices that sit in our mouth, constantly monitoring our
health and telling us off if we light up a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine it telling you, 'Go see your physician' or 'Danger: You
Have Taken in Too Much Alcohol,'" Tabak says. "You can fantasize
about all kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Substance of Substance</TE>
<TE>   Nerve signals from the brain prompt the three main pairs of
salivary glands (the parotic, sublingual and submandibular) to
release saliva. The taste, sight or even thought of food increases
the signals.</TE>
<TE>   What's In It</TE>
<TE>   Saliva contains hundreds of proteins and other chemicals with a
wide array of properties. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Mucins, proteins that make saliva stringy, protecting the teeth
and gums and fighting bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   * Histatins, lactoferrin, lyzozyme and peroxidase, proteins that
appear to fight bacteria and yeast.</TE>
<TE>   * Proline-rich proteins that allow large amounts of calcium
phosphate to exist in our saliva--preventing our tooth enamel from
dissolving.</TE>
<TE>   * Amylase, an enzyme that breaks starch into sugars and begins
digestion of food before it reaches the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   * Chemicals such as epidermal growth factor and one called SLPI
(or "slippy"') that aid in wound healing.</TE>
<TE>   * Hormones and drugs that reveal much about our physiology, making
spit useful in crime and medicine.</TE>

<LD>Although premenstrual syndrome and menopause are often the topics of
casual conversation among women, yeast infections remain somehow out
of bounds. Yet the fact that dietary changes may help conquer the
problem surely warrants discussion.</LD>
<LD>   The infections, also known as vaginal thrush, are caused by a
normally harmless yeast called Candida albicans. The organism resides
in moist, warm areas of the body, such as the mouth and vagina, and
can sometimes begin to grow out of control.</LD>
<LD>   Yeast infections can be hard to identify because they are
sometimes confused with vaginosis (caused by bacteria) or a sexually
transmitted disease. But if intense itching, inflammation, redness in
the external genital area and a white vaginal discharge are the
symptoms, then chances are a yeast infection is the culprit.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, there is no point in adopting a
yeast-free diet. The yeast used to make bread rise is quite different
from that responsible for yeast infections.</TE>
<TE>   What can make a difference, however, is increasing your intake of
foods that increase the amount of "friendly" bacteria in the part of
the large intestine called the colon. Known as probiotic bacteria,
they help boost the immune system--thus helping the body fight
infection by Candida--and appear to keep the pH level of the vagina
lower, which discourages yeast growth.</TE>
<TE>   Look for yogurts and yogurt drinks containing acidophilus or
bifidus cultures or try probiotic supplements available in health
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever form is chosen, daily consumption is recommended for at
least six months if yeast infections are chronic, because when
intakes drop, so do the colon's levels of probiotic bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Fructo-oligosaccharide, an indigestible form of carbohydrate, may
also help. Found in highest amounts in onions, chicory, artichokes,
garlic, bananas and the herb burdock, this substance makes its way to
the colon, where it acts as a food source for probiotic bacteria,
enabling them to multiply and grow. Known as FOS or prebiotics,
fructo-oligosaccharide is available in supplement form.</TE>
<TE>   Vitamin C is also a must, because in addition to being an
immune-system booster, it appears to actually inhibit the growth of
yeast. Citrus fruits and juices, papaya, berries, peppers and
potatoes are all good sources.</TE>
<TE>   Overgrowth of Candida albicans is sparked by a disturbance of the
normal balance of yeast or the pH level of the vagina. This can be
caused by something as simple as tight jeans and nylon underwear,
which restrict air circulation. In such cases, self-treatment with
over-the-counter creams may be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Other triggers include stress and a lack of sleep, which lower the
immune system; a course of antibiotics, which may disturb the colon's
balance of good and bad bacteria; and diabetes or pregnancy, which
can affect the body's hormonal balances and pH level. If the
infection was caused by one of these factors, a doctor may need to
prescribe an oral anti-fungal drug.</TE>
<TE>   With yeast infections, the saying "forewarned is forearmed" has
never been truer. By reducing risk factors--and making nutritional
changes--you can lower the chance of an outbreak and possibly prevent
a yeast infection from becoming an uncomfortable and debilitating
chronic condition.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new NASA study shows that the rate at which greenhouse gases enter
the Earth's atmosphere has slowed over the last 20 years. Part of the
decrease is because of the Montreal Protocol, which phased out
ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons, that also act as
greenhouse gases. There was also a reduction in the rate at which
methane, carbon dioxide and soot entered the atmosphere, for reasons
that remain unclear. The finding, said NASA's James Hansen, suggests
that limiting methane and soot emissions could ease warming problems
in the short term.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a laser beam and a handful of reflectors left behind by Apollo
astronauts, a University of Washington astronomer is planning to find
out how far away the moon really is. The center of the moon is
roughly 238,700 miles from the center of the Earth. Measurements in
the early '70s were only precise to within 10 inches. Current
technology has trimmed the margin of error to less than an inch, but
that's not good enough for astronomer Tom Murphy. He plans within
about a year to attach a laser to a 3.5-meter telescope at Apache
Point, N.M., and send "bullets" of light to prism-like reflectors on
the moon. The technique should reveal the moon's distance to within 1
millimeter--about the thickness of a paper clip.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An international team of botanists has discovered a new genus and
species of conifer, a cone-bearing evergreen tree, in a remote part
of northern Vietnam. The tree, classified as part of the cypress
family, has been named Xanthocyparis vietnamensis, and was given the
common name golden Vietnamese cypress. The tree is unusual because it
bears two kinds of foliage: needles and scale leaves. It is
endangered because it was discovered long ago by locals and is prized
for its hard, yellowish, fragrant timber, said one of the
discoverers, Daniel Harder of UC Santa Cruz. Harder's team also
discovered two dozen orchid species.</LD>

<HD>Freezing a Moving Target</HD>
<DH>Some areas of Antarctica are growing while others are
melting, but satellites might help explain the contrast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glaciers are supposed to be, well, glacial. For a time, glaciologists
wondered if they moved at all. Recent studies of the world's largest
glaciers--the ice sheets and streams of Antarctica--show glaciers can
act as if alive. They advance and retreat, "binge and purge," lose
weight and then rapidly grow thick around the middle.</LD>
<LD>   The glaciers of Antarctica refuse to play by the rules--at least
the rules glaciologists understand. Two studies from scientists at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory show adjacent parts of one of
Antarctica's ice sheets are acting in opposite ways.</LD>
<LD>   One part of the west Antarctic ice sheet near the Amundsen Sea is
retreating, thinning rapidly and breaking off into huge icebergs the
size of Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut. Ice streams cutting
through an area near the Ross Sea, meanwhile, are grinding to a halt
and growing thicker and more stable as scientists watch.</LD>
<TE>   "This is something new to glaciology," said Eric Rignot, a JPL
glaciologist and the author of a study soon to be published in the
Annals of Glaciology showing rapid disintegration of some of the
continent's largest glaciers. "I don't think anyone expected to see
such changes in less than a decade."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Ian Joughin, who works just down the hall from Rignot
at JPL, has just completed a study that shows stability in the ice
sheet. "We've seen a wide range of behavior," said Joughin, whose
study is published in the current issue of the journal Science.
"There's a lot more variability than conventional wisdom would
indicate."</TE>
<TE>   Understanding of the vast ice sheets of Antarctica has been a high
priority for scientists for more than a decade. In the early '90s,
there were indications that the ice sheet in western Antarctica, a
layer 6,500 feet thick and the size of Mexico, was retreating
rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gauging the Chances of  a 'Catastrophic Collapse'</TE>
<TE>   The ice sheet has long been considered Antarctica's "weak
underbelly."</TE>
<TE>   The base of the sheet sits below sea level. Because of that, if it
thinned, it could rise and begin to float. That would allow it to
melt from its top and bottom, increasing the chances of a rapid
disintegration--what scientists have termed a "catastrophic
collapse." The ice sheet has disappeared completely and re-formed at
least once in its 20-million-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Because Antarctica holds 90% of the world's ice and 70% of its
fresh water, some models suggested that the disintegration of the ice
sheet could raise global sea levels by 20 feet within a century.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of a catastrophic collapse have largely evaporated with more
detailed studies of the ice sheet. British Antarctic Survey
scientists recently estimated that the risk of a 3-foot sea level
rise from an ice sheet collapse was just 5%.</TE>
<TE>   But new data, including Rignot's work showing disintegration of
some of the continent's largest glaciers--the Pine Island and
Thwaites glaciers--still raise concerns about smaller but more rapid
increases in sea level.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not out of the woods yet," said Robert Bindschadler, a
glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
who has studied Antarctic ice for two decades. Global sea levels have
risen by about 2 millimeters per year for the last century, he said,
and only half of that rise is accounted for. Lesser-known areas of
Antarctica's eastern side, he said, might play a role.</TE>
<TE>   Predicting the future of any of the continent's ice sheets remains
nearly impossible. "Even just measuring ... whether the ice sheet is
growing or shrinking has proved difficult," says Penn State
University glaciologist Richard Alley, an expert on rapid climate
change and the behavior of ice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Effects of Global Warming</TE>
<TE>   Bindschadler was one of many involved in early attempts to
describe the glaciers and their vagaries. That heroic early work
involved camping on the ice in fierce winds and temperatures that
routinely reached 40 below zero, dragging around bulky Doppler radar
instruments and gingerly riding snowmobiles between yawing crevasses
to drill deep holes in the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Though such measurements still prove invaluable, they are spotty.
Antarctica is so difficult to reach and to travel across that
scientists have been able to visit only a tiny portion of the
continent. A new generation of work relies on satellites with radars
and lasers that measure the entire continent with high precision to
detect even the smallest changes in the ice. "Radar is like having a
million GPS units on the ground, wherever you want them," said
Rignot, who has yet to set foot on the continent he knows so well.</TE>
<TE>   The new work using U.S., Canadian and European satellites,
combined with decades of field work, could help glaciologists finally
understand the strange behavior of the ice sheet and how it may be
affected by climate changes. A new NASA satellite called Icesat will
help once it is launched later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The area Rignot studies, where the Pine Island and Thwaites
glaciers meet the Amundsen Sea, may be affected by the human-induced
global warming of the last century. Because global warming raises
ocean temperatures around Antarctica, it could be increasing the rate
at which icebergs break off, float north and melt.</TE>
<TE>   "There the ice sheet is probably feeling very recent changes in
climate," said Bindschadler, who has used NASA and the U.S.
Geological Survey's Landsat and declassified CIA satellite images to
study the ice sheets. But the majority of the ice sheet that is
inland and atop solid ground does not appear to be affected by the
current climate. "It's so well insulated," Bindschadler said, "it
takes thousands or tens of thousands of years to see any effect." The
behavior seen in much of the ice sheet recently, he said, is probably
in response to the end of the last Ice Age.</TE>
<TE>   Or it might not be in response to climate at all. "Is this simply
the ice sheet breathing?" Joughin asked.</TE>
<TE>   Most glaciologists agree that the changes in glaciers are not due
simply to melting or a decrease in snowfall but to "ice dynamics." A
key to the behavior of glaciers lies not in the ice that comprises
them, but in the gravelly till that underlies them. When it gets
colder, this till layer gets drier and acts as a brake, preventing
the glacier from slipping quickly, Joughin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to understand what's happening at the bed," Rignot said.</TE>
<TE>   The report by Joughin and glaciologist Slawek Tulaczyk of UC Santa
Cruz suggests that a glacial bed could also start to freeze after a
long period of retreat. As the glaciers got thinner in past decades,
they became less insulating and allowed more cold to creep through to
the bed. Once glaciers stop moving and discharging ice, they can get
thicker again.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of the current sea level rise is attributed to global
warming and is caused by the expansion of seawater as it heats and
the melting of low-latitude glaciers such as the one atop Africa's
Mt. Kilimanjaro. Thickening of Antarctica's ice sheets could help
offset that rise.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had beachfront property," Joughin said, "I wouldn't sell it
just yet."</TE>

glaciologist Richard Alley says.</CP>

<LD>How far back can you trace your roots?</LD>
<LD>   A chance meeting between Mom and Dad? The Mayflower? An early
Egyptian king?</LD>
<LD>   Some people trace their family trees obsessively, rooting around
for the sources of a peculiar down-turned nose or upturned eyebrow;
for perfect pitch or debilitating neuroses; for inspiration or
inheritance, or both.</LD>
<TE>   For better or for worse, our roots anchor us in place. Everything
else is the tip of the iceberg, proverbial and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Icebergs, as the Titanic found out the hard way, have deep and
often invisible roots. The roots support the tip. If it weren't for
the root, the whole thing would sink.</TE>
<TE>   This was the discovery that reportedly led Archimedes to run naked
down the streets yelling "Eureka," still dripping from his bath: It's
the roots of things that enable them to float. It's what's beneath
the surface that holds everything up--whether it's a rubber duck
floating in a tub or an ice cube floating in glass.</TE>
<TE>   So it makes sense that we spend a lot of time digging around for
roots. Roots support, nourish, anchor, explain.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a mountain. How tall can it get? It all depends on the
root.</TE>
<TE>   Mountains, like icebergs, float on the denser material (the
Earth's mantel) underneath. The taller the mountain, the deeper the
root, and even though you can't see the root of a mountain, you can
detect it indirectly. The massive root of the Himalayas, for example,
has been measured by its gravitational pull on a sensitive pendulum
bob.</TE>
<TE>   You might conclude from this that most of what we know is but the
tip of some kind of iceberg--just a small peek at what lies beneath.
Like the symptoms of disease. Like the whitecaps on water. (Did you
know that underneath the crest of every ocean wave is a deep circular
current of water?)</TE>
<TE>   It seems to be so.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the very matter that makes up Earth and stars and sky
appears to be nothing but froth on a deep ocean of dark matter whose
swirling currents carry along everything else.</TE>
<TE>   We don't yet know what dark matter might be, but it's responsible
for the shape of the galaxy, the fate of the universe at large.</TE>
<TE>   All the twinkling stars and glowing galaxies are but the grin on
this sly Cheshire cat, the tiny beacon of the lighthouse hiding huge
outcrops of rock.</TE>
<TE>   Even atoms have structural roots. Take carbon, my personal
favorite. Life is based on carbon because carbon has four outer
electrons that stick like little strips of Velcro to atoms next door,
allowing the atoms to form long and elaborate chains. Think of these
attachment points as outstretched hands.</TE>
<TE>   What gives carbon this marvelous property?</TE>
<TE>   The electrons are anchored by the positive attraction of protons
deep in the nucleus. Unlike the root of a mountain or iceberg, the
root of an atom takes up but a tiny amount of space. But in mass, it
accounts for nearly all of the atom's heft. The root is also the
core.</TE>
<TE>   That's why roots have such great explanatory power. They tell us
why things are the way they are. The underpinnings not only of atoms,
but also of crime, poverty, war. We call them root causes for a
reason.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, cosmologists study the origins of the universe not
merely because they are curious about how it came to be (and they
are), but also because origins are instructive. Why is our universe
constructed of gravity and electricity, electrons and quarks, three
dimensions of space and one of time?</TE>
<TE>   Is it the outcome of some quirk of cosmic fate? A chance event,
like your mother meeting your father? Or is it the inevitable
consequence of the inherent nature of physical law? More like an
arranged marriage?</TE>
<TE>   Does our universe itself have roots in other universes?</TE>
<TE>   A deep enough look at the roots of time might help us find out.</TE>
<TE>   And if we could understand the roots of life, the origins of the
first living beings, the forces behind evolution, we could better
understand ourselves. We might even be able to predict what kinds of
life could exist on other worlds, and how to contact it.</TE>
<TE>   On this planet, at least, we know that life's roots go deep,
roughly 4 billion years.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find anything that doesn't depend for its sustenance
on hidden roots: volcanoes, rivers, hair, teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Kill the root and destroy what flowers on the surface. That would
include, among other things, culture. For ideas also spring from
roots.</TE>
<TE>   So mark well what lies beneath: the water, the words, the laws,
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Don't neglect your roots. You can't leave home without them.</TE>

<HD>Carrie Hamilton, 38; Drug Fight Publicized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carrie Hamilton, daughter of entertainer Carol Burnett and the late
producer Joe Hamilton, whose drug problems prompted a family crusade
two decades ago and who recently completed a play based on her
mother's autobiography, has died. She was 38.</LD>
<LD>   The actress, musician and writer died Sunday of cancer at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to the family
publicist, Deborah Kelman.</LD>
<LD>   At Hamilton's suggestion, she and Burnett wrote the play,
"Hollywood Arms," based on Burnett's best-selling memoir, "One More
Time." The play, directed by the influential Broadway
producer-director Hal Prince, is scheduled for its world premiere
April 29 at Chicago's Goodman Theater.</LD>
<TE>   Carrie Hamilton was only a teenager when she burst into national
news--not because of acting or writing songs or plays or films but
because of her addiction to marijuana, Quaaludes and cocaine and what
her parents chose to do about it. The revelation was made in a 1979
People magazine article titled "Carol Burnett's Nightmare" and
detailing the two-year effort to get Hamilton off drugs.</TE>
<TE>   By then the girl was in a Houston drug rehabilitation program.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm compulsive and I'm extremist, and I did have a big ego. I
wanted to be Big Something," Hamilton told The Times shortly after
the magazine article was published. "If I couldn't be the big wheel,
at least I could be the big dope fiend."</TE>
<TE>   Burnett and Joe Hamilton, who later blamed a marital separation
partially on their daughter's drug problems, said they chose to speak
out about their experiences to help other families cope with a
growing problem among well-to-do teenagers. They became fund-raisers
for the clinic where Carrie was treated.</TE>
<TE>   As she matured, Hamilton followed her parents into the
entertainment industry, making her first big acting splash in the
television series "Fame" in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   She hosted specials, "Superstars &amp; Their Moms" in 1987 and 1988
and sang on such programs as "Beverly Hills Brats" and in the
telecast of the 1989 Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton acted in episodes of several popular television series,
including "Beverly Hills 90210," "Murder, She Wrote," "Walker, Texas
Ranger," "Brooklyn South," "Touched By an Angel," "The Pretender" and
"The X-Files."</TE>
<TE>   Among her feature film credits are "Cool World," "Tokyo Pop" and
"Just Desserts." She also worked with a profit-sharing film company,
for which she wrote and directed short films. One, "Lunchtime
Thomas," earned her the Women in Film Award at the 2001 Latino Film
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton was interviewed for the 1998 television special about her
mother, "Intimate Portrait: Carol Burnett."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include Burnett and two sisters, Erin and Jody Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   The family said that services will be private and asked that any
memorial donations be sent to the American Lung Assn. at 5858
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90048.</TE>

<HD>Rev. Joseph R. Fahey, 65; Donated Blackjack Winnings to
Jesuit Order</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Joseph R. Fahey, a master fund-raiser who donated tens of
thousands of dollars to his Jesuit order with the help of his
card-counting skills, died Wednesday in a Boston hospital of an
apparent heart attack. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Garbed in his single blue suit, Fahey played blackjack tables from
Atlantic City to Las Vegas, in his words "all for the greater glory
of God," until the casinos blacklisted him.</LD>
<LD>   He was considered a mathematical genius and donated his winnings
from gambling to the Society of Jesus to uphold his vow of poverty.</LD>
<TE>   "Many Jesuit missions owe a great debt to him and his abilities at
the card table," said John Dunn, who worked for Fahey at Boston
College High School.</TE>
<TE>   As president of Boston College High from 1988 to 1998, Fahey
boosted the school's endowment by 500%, financing an athletic center,
library and computer laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Fahey received a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1967 and was ordained a priest in 1968. He
taught economics at Holy Cross College in Worcester from 1968 to
1970, becoming dean of academics from 1971 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He also taught economics at Boston College. On the last day of
each semester, he treated students to a lesson on card counting and
an explanation of how he beat the odds in blackjack.</TE>
<TE>   The class was always well-attended.</TE>
<TE>   Fahey earned his bachelor's degree in economics and master's in
philosophy from Boston College. While working on his doctorate at
MIT, he became an expert on the economics of local taxation and wrote
his thesis on what a local income tax or local sales tax would do for
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Fahey was provincial assistant for
finance of the New England province for the Jesuit order.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a sister, Peggy Fahey Annett, of Newtown, Conn.</TE>

<HD>Everett Kircher, 85; Pioneer Made Ski Resorts Viable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everett Kircher, a ski industry pioneer who figured out how to move
more people up a mountain, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Kircher died Wednesday in Petoskey in northern Michigan. He had
been hospitalized three days earlier because of weakness, but no
specific cause of death was disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The entrepreneur was one of the last of the generation who marched
into the mountains in the years after World War II to carve out a
career in the nation's burgeoning ski industry. His innovations
changed the way people enjoyed the sport and helped make ski resorts
a financially viable business.</LD>
<TE>   "Everett was the only other guy besides Dave McCoy, who built
Mammoth Mountain, to really think outside the box," said Warren
Miller, the maker of popular ski films and a friend of Kircher's.</TE>
<TE>   "These are guys who built ski resorts and still own them today.
Everything else in the industry has gone corporate, where the main
concern is how much money they can squeeze out of every visitor,"
Miller added.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Kircher owned a Studebaker dealership in Detroit, his
hometown, but had an uneasy feeling the brand would soon be in
trouble. So, he turned to his first love: skiing.</TE>
<TE>   He then found land he liked in northern Michigan. According to
legend, a farmer who owned the land told Kircher it was too steep to
grow anything on. Kircher nodded in agreement, then purchased the
land for $1.</TE>
<TE>   Boyne Mountain soon became the largest ski resort between New
England and the Rockies and was the destination of choice for
thousands of skiers from the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   To promote the sport, Kircher hired Olympic champion skiers Stein
Erickson and Othmar Schneider to lead his ski school and schmooze
with customers.</TE>
<TE>   The resort also became a sort of laboratory for Kircher.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, he installed the first three-person chairlift. At the
time, most lifts only carried one or two skiers per chair and
traveled at a glacial pace. As a consequence, many ski resorts
suffered endless lift lines, in which skiers would complain, with
justification, they were spending more time standing than schussing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Kircher topped himself and created a four-seat lift,
which became the industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   Kircher then set his sights on fixing the weather.</TE>
<TE>   While resorts in the West and New England often received plenty of
snow, low-lying Midwest resorts often struggled with long dry spells.
To fix this problem, Kircher refined the snow gun, which was capable
of carpeting grass with man-made snow. The innovation extended the
ski season at resorts that were often at the mercy of the weather.</TE>
<TE>   When business flattened out in Michigan, Kircher began acquiring
resorts out west to diversify his holdings. He would purchase Big Sky
in Montana; Crystal Mountain in Washington; Cypress Mountain in
Vancouver, B.C.; and Brighton in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   To keep business going in summer, he often built golf courses at
his resorts, a practice that is now standard in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   At Big Sky, in southern Montana, the Kircher family upgraded the
resort by constructing an audaciously steep tram to the top of
11,166-foot Lone Mountain. From the summit, it's a 4,350-foot drop
for skiers to the base of the resort, a run that's still considered
one of the nation's most difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Although his four children would take prominent roles in his
company, Boyne USA Resorts, Kircher never really retired. "When you
started [in this business] over 50 years ago, how are you going to
tear yourself away from it?" Kircher said in a 1998 interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll retire when my heart stops."</TE>
<TE>   Despite suffering kidney problems the last few years, he still
managed to go deer hunting in November and bagged an eight-point buck
with a bow and arrow--while sitting in his wheelchair in a blind. It
was this kind of spirit, said Miller, that epitomized the kind of man
Kircher was.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys like Everett are from a generation that thinks differently,"
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "To these guys, skiing was a sport first and a business second.
They had the fervent desire to share the freedom skiing has to offer
with more people and to find ways to do that. And they did."</TE>
<TE>   Kircher is survived by his wife, Lois; daughters, Amy and Kathryn;
and sons, Stephen and John.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial is planned for Tuesday in Boyne Falls, Mich.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheik Hammoud bin Oqla al-Shoeiby, 77, an Islamic cleric who was
praised by the Al Qaeda terror group and censured by the Saudi
government, died Saturday in Breida in central Saudi Arabia of a
heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Although blind, Al-Shoeiby rose to become a leading Islamic
scholar whose students included Saudi Arabia's current minister of
justice and former Islamic affairs minister.</LD>
<LD>   In October, the sheik attracted international attention when he
issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling for holy war against the
United States in support of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and
their Al Qaeda allies. Shortly afterward, an Al Qaeda spokesman
expressed appreciation for Al-Shoeiby in a videotaped message
broadcast by the Arabic satellite channel Al-Jazeera.</LD>
<TE>   The Saudi government banned Al-Shoeiby from issuing edicts or
giving sermons. Interior Minister Prince Nayef issued a statement
saying that only authorized clerics could issue fatwas.</TE>

<LD>Jack Douglass, 91, Nevada gambling pioneer who co-founded Reno's Club
Cal Neva, died of natural causes Wednesday at his Reno home.</LD>
<LD>   Douglass, who held the oldest active casino license in the state
of Nevada for many years, also developed Reno's Comstock Hotel-Casino
in 1978 and served as chairman of the board until it closed in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   His long career began in the mid-1930s with an amusement games and
slot machine route among the bars of central Nevada mining camps.</LD>
<TE>   About 1960, he entered a partnership that bought the Riverside
Hotel in Reno, which he managed for a year. Then, Douglass, Warren
Nelson and others founded the Cal Neva. He later bought the Cal Neva
Lodge at Lake Tahoe when Frank Sinatra lost his gambling license
there. Douglass sold his interest in the Cal Neva in 1986.</TE>

<LD>Norman Kay, 74, often known as the "Babe Ruth of Bridge" because of
his skill at the card game, died Thursday in Philadelphia of a
pulmonary embolism.</LD>
<LD>   The American Contract Bridge League named Kay its top North
American player from 1957 to 1977. He was inducted into the Bridge
Hall of Fame in 1996 and often represented the United States in
international competition, although he never won a world
championship.</LD>
<LD>   Kay played with the same tournament partner for more than 40
years, hall-of-famer Edgar Kaplan, who died in 1997. Kay grew up in
Merchantville and started playing bridge in 1944 as a high school
senior.</LD>
<TE>   He continued to play bridge as a hobby during his 38-year career
at Merrill Lynch, winning 14 national team championships and
countless regional and lower-profile titles. He amassed more than
13,000 master points, which are awarded under a complicated formula
that measures achievement in competitive play.</TE>

<LD>   Senate leader John Burton is the type who will buy blankets and
drive around San Francisco handing them out to the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   Or he'll hit up a special interest, not just for money to fuel
some Democrat's campaign, but for $5,000 worth of stocking caps to
distribute to denizens of the sidewalk. Then he'll put the bite on
for rain ponchos.</LD>
<TE>   Three decades ago, then- Assemblyman Burton kept state mental
hospitals open by masterminding the override of a Ronald Reagan veto.
It was the only veto Gov. Reagan ever had overridden.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, Burton's late brother, Assemblyman and Congressman
Phillip Burton, was a legendary crusader for welfare moms and the
working class.</TE>
<TE>   "We were brought up to be that way," says Burton, 69, whose father
became a doctor in middle age. "My old man, he'd do house calls in
the Fillmore, a black area, at 2 in the morning. And if the family
looked like it didn't have money, he'd say, 'Forget it. Go buy the
kid a pair of shoes.'"</TE>
<TE>   So when the Senate leader, trying to salvage benefits for the
poor, proposed an income tax increase on the wealthiest-- married
couples with taxable earnings over $260,000--and the governor was
about to brush him off in his State of the State address, the old
liberal got even more grouchy than normal. He "hit traffic and fog"
and didn't show up until the very end of the speech.</TE>
<TE>   And when Davis, in order to balance a $100-billion budget, later
proposed paring benefits for the working poor, welfare families and
the aged, blind and disabled, Burton called it "immoral."</TE>
<TE>   "For some people," Burton said, "it can be the difference between
tuna fish and cat food for lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Then some senators who are fond of Burton raised their eyebrows
and asked themselves-- and subsequently him--whether he really wasn't
going too far.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Burton and Davis both are Democrats and this is an
election year, many noted. Moreover, a Senate leader should show
respect for the office of governor, even if he has little regard for
the occupant.</TE>
<TE>   "Some believe there ought to be more conciliation," says a
senator, speaking anonymously. But this Democrat adds that Burton "is
saying stuff others wish they could but are afraid.... The majority
of us believe the governor is off the mark with a lot of things."</TE>
<TE>   Another Burton ally says the Senate leader "crossed the line" by
showing up just in time for post-speech media interviews.</TE>
<TE>   He continues: "Most of the senior membership of the Senate were
concerned. Each of us touched base with John. Some of the concern had
to do with caring about John, trying to make sure he's OK."</TE>
<TE>   He's increasingly irrational, top Davis advisors contend. Says
one: "Bad manners, bad politics. The governor sits there in total
disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   It's especially puzzling, the aide says, because Davis did Burton
a political favor by clearing the way for his daughter, Kimiko
Burton, to be named San Francisco public defender. (Davis appointed
the previous defender, Jeff Brown, to the Public Utilities
Commission.)</TE>
<TE>   No question, Davis and Burton have an unhealthy relationship. It's
the most openly strained of any between a governor and legislative
leader of the same party since at least the mid-'60s when Pat Brown
and Speaker Jesse Unruh feuded.</TE>
<TE>   The animosity hampers compromise on major legislation and sours
the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Many Burton insiders say he has a visceral dislike of Davis. "He
really can't stand him," says one. "He's told everybody who will
listen."</TE>
<TE>   It's about being "genuine versus contrived," explains another.
Davis is viewed throughout the Capitol as politically calculating,
with few--if any--core beliefs. Burton is committed to the poor
against the powerful.</TE>
<TE>   The two are opposites in politics and personality. Davis is a
cautious centrist; Burton a bold bleeding heart. Davis is aloof;
Burton extroverted.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch last week, Burton denied he viscerally dislikes Davis.
He'd just had a fence-mending dinner the night before with the
governor's top two aides, Chief of Staff Lynn Schenk and Cabinet
Secretary Susan Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not dislike him," Burton insisted, his voice rising. "Never
have. I get upset. He gets upset with me. I don't dislike people, I
dislike what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators like Burton, despite his ill manners and crudeness. "A
softie at heart," they say. "He'll go to the mat for you.... We give
John a lot of space."</TE>
<TE>   Some encroached on that space with friendly criticism last week.
But he's in no danger of being dethroned. The San Franciscan no doubt
will reign as Senate leader until he's termed out in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he'll help the homeless stay warm and the poor keep
benefits--give Davis fits and liven up the Capitol for the rest of
us.</TE>

<HD>Birds Are Rediscovering Owens Lake</HD>
<DH>Nature: Re-watering effort to reduce dust should attract
some migratory species, and help others in decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OLANCHA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In 1985, Mike Prather began hearing stories about birds at dry Owens
Lake.</LD>
<LD>   It was strange news. A teacher in nearby Lone Pine and an avid
bird-watcher, Prather had thought Owens Lake was a long-lost cause.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had stuck its mighty
straw into the Owens River decades earlier and, as a result, the lake
had virtually dried up by the mid-1920s.</LD>
<LD>   Prather and his bird-watching buddies around the Owens Valley were
intrigued. They started making regular visits to the lake, scarcely
believing what they were seeing.</LD>
<TE>   "People see the lake from the highway and presume it's dead," says
Prather. "But on its fringes, there were still wetlands and marshes,
some only postage-stamp size, and there were springs and there was
some water. And there were birds. Sometimes thousands of them. This
lake refused to die."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, several interested parties--including Prather,
environmentalists, researchers and even the DWP--will be monitoring
the lake to see just how alive it is.</TE>
<TE>   Since November, the DWP has been re-watering about 10 square miles
of the lake bed in an attempt to reduce the dust storms that have
plagued the region for years. Although the lake will remain a far cry
from what it was--it once covered 110 square miles--Prather and many
others believe the new water will attract migratory birds and help
some species now in decline, such as the snowy plover.</TE>
<TE>   "The seed is here," says Prather, standing on the lake bed on a
recent day. "The algae will come back, then the flies, then the birds
because of this institutional-type memory birds have that this place
is here."</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of the High Sierra 190 miles north of Los Angeles,
Owens Lake once drew millions of ducks, geese, gulls and other
shorebirds traveling between their breeding grounds in the north and
winter range in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Grinnell, the famous California naturalist, described a
visit to the lake in 1917 in his field notes:</TE>
<TE>   "Great numbers of birds are in sight along the lake
shore--avocets, phalaropes and ducks. Large flocks of shorebirds in
flight over the water in the distance.... There must be literally
thousands of birds within sight of this one spot."</TE>
<TE>   Owens is one of a string of shallow, salty, insect-filled lakes in
the deserts of the Great Basin, an area that covers most of eastern
California, Nevada and Utah. Before the lake dried up, one researcher
described it as a "small analog" of Utah's Great Salt Lake, which is
believed to have the richest bird habitat in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last century, many lakes and wetlands in the West have
shrunk or undergone other changes, often for the worse, as water has
been diverted for human use. Migratory bird populations have declined
in concert with the drop in quality habitat over the last century.</TE>
<TE>   "The people putting together these different water projects said
the birds could go somewhere else, but the somewhere elses aren't
there anymore," says Dave Shuford, a biologist with the Point Reyes
Bird Observatory north of San Francisco. "It's unappreciated just how
much was lost at places like Owens Lake. And, because we don't know
just how much was lost, it's hard to defend what's left."</TE>
<TE>   Important clues to what Owens Lake was once like can be found
about 100 miles to the north at Mono Lake. Although not as deep as it
once was because of water diversions by the DWP, millions of
shorebirds, including the eared grebe, still visit Mono each year.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction is the trillions of brine flies that hatch each
year in Mono's waters. A small bird called the phalarope, for
example, will double or triple its weight by gorging on the flies and
then fly 3,000 miles nonstop to winter in South America.</TE>
<TE>   The same species of brine fly is still found in the springs on
Owens Lake's fringes, according to Dave Herbst, a research biologist
with the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory in Mammoth Lakes.
That indicates, he says, that the fly population at Owens could
explode if enough algae grow on the water the DWP is now putting back
into the lake.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a kind of green algae sitting out there in the lake's
crust," Herbst says. "This algae can sit out there like dormant seed
for a fairly long time, but when they're wetted, they essentially
germinate. Because of this, if we want, we can reconstruct these
types of lake environments."</TE>
<TE>   Herbst is quick to point out that these are big "ifs." There's no
guarantee that assemblages of birds like those that once used Owens
will show up again. And kick-starting the lake's basic ecology will
depend largely, he says, on how often the DWP dumps water into the
lake and whether the water is managed so that it reaches appropriate
levels of salinity.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Harasick, the DWP's Owens Lake program director, does not
mince words about his agency's priorities. "What we're going to do at
the lake will attract birds," he says. "That's pretty well
understood. But we're not there to operate a bird sanctuary, although
the birds will be a happy byproduct [of the dust-control program]."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the DWP is obligated to continue re-watering parts of the
lake in the future, and the agency is sensitive to the needs of
wildlife, Harasick said.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP's intentions have long been a matter of debate in the
Owens Valley, where many residents still accuse Los Angeles of
robbing them of their water and well-being. Prather is not holding
his breath that the DWP will commit any more of Los Angeles' water
than it has to.</TE>
<TE>   But he says that may not matter. If the agency puts any water out
there, he says, the birds will come. And other areas of the lake
still receive a ration of water from the springs.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, Prather wades through the mud on Owens Lake's
western shore to a stream trickling into the lake from a spring.
There are algae in the creek. A hundred yards away, a few dozen
graceful shorebirds, American avocets, peck away at brine shrimp.
Prather has even seen peregrine falcons and other raptors in the
vicinity that prey on the shorebirds.</TE>
<TE>   "The lake was almost lost in the first place because people
thought letting water flow into it was a waste," he says. "And it has
been hard finding a constituency that wants to save what's left. But
what's happening here now is just amazing, and we're going to get to
see it."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Budget Cut Plans to Be Considered</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Some Democratic lawmakers are expected to
oppose efforts to trim programs that help the poor. Education funding
is also an issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As lawmakers prepare to take up Gov. Gray Davis' plan to immediately
trim $2.2 billion from the state budget, opposition is mounting
against some of the proposals that would hit the poor the hardest.</LD>
<LD>   Although most legislators realize they have to cut the state's
current budget to balance the next one, some are questioning whether
a handful of the more than 80 proposals outlined by Davis make sense.</LD>
<LD>   Some Democratic lawmakers, for example, oppose scaling back a
program that helps low-income Californians with their energy bills.
They also do not want to delay plans to help poorly performing
schools and provide health insurance for struggling parents.</LD>
<TE>   Adopting the $2.2 billion in cuts is a key step in a larger effort
by Davis to help close a $12.5-billion shortfall that is expected to
materialize in the next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are scheduled to take up the Davis proposals Tuesday
during a joint budget committee hearing, setting the stage for
subcommittee debates later this week and for consideration by the
full Legislature perhaps by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Davis called the Legislature into a special session earlier this
month to consider both the spending reductions and his economic
stimulus plan.</TE>
<TE>   The latter plan includes selling $678 million in bonds to finance
construction, primarily at state colleges and universities, and to
make newly increased unemployment insurance benefits retroactive to
Sept. 11 to help California workers who lost their jobs as a result
of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It is the governor's cuts package, however, that will have the
most direct and immediate effect on closing California's budget gap.
Negotiations are expected to take place between the Davis
administration and legislative leaders over a compromise package.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative, some Democratic lawmakers suggest trimming
Davis programs that pay bonuses to teachers and schools for improving
student performance. Davis' 2002-03 budget proposal, for example,
includes $157 million for the governor's performance awards for
schools that meet certain Academic Performance Index targets.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Burton, the San Francisco Democrat who controls the
state Senate, said he has never believed that the awards are the best
way to spend public money. He said he is still gauging the effect of
a Davis proposal to return to the general fund $53.7 million
earmarked for a program to assist low-income Californians with their
energy bills.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent there's money that doesn't need to be spent and
can't be spent, that's one thing," Burton said. "But if there's money
that is needed to protect low-income elderly people by keeping them
warm in the winter months, we're not going to let that cut happen."</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers are not comfortable with several of the $843
million in proposals to cut and delay education programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us are already developing alternative lists," said
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, a Los Angeles Democrat on the Assembly
Education Committee. "We don't necessarily disagree with the $843
million, but we think there's a better way to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg wants to redirect $50 million proposed by Davis to reward
certificated staff working at low-performing schools to other
education programs on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   "I would take that $50 million in a red-hot minute," Goldberg
said. For example, she said she would prefer to maintain $40 million
to make school funding more equal.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Vasconcellos, the Santa Clara Democrat who heads the
Senate Education Committee, wants $30 million to $40 million kept in
the budget so that planning can proceed on a program to shower the
state's worst-performing schools with $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Davis proposed delaying the program's start date to July 1, which
his administration contends will save $30 million to $50
million--roughly the amount Vasconcellos wants restored. Vasconcellos
did not, however, suggest that other education programs be scaled
back to restore the planning money.</TE>
<TE>   "I would very much like to preserve some money so that the
planning process could be finished by June 30 so that we can kick off
the new school year with this program ready to go," Vasconcellos
said. "California students are depending upon us to figure out a way
to provide a lifeline to the kids at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Some education leaders are siding with lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Johnson, president of the powerful California Teachers
Assn., said he would rather spend money on low-performing schools or
improving funding equality among districts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always taken the position that we did not like the
bonuses and performance award money, and we would rather see it spent
almost any other way than that," Johnson said. "Philosophically it is
not popular with our membership."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio disagreed with Johnson and said the
governor would be extremely reluctant to have to negotiate the issue.
The reward money, he added, has been one of Davis' signature
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not wildly popular in the Legislature. It never has been,"
Maviglio said. "But I think it's been well received among
rank-and-file teachers who have been rewarded for their outstanding
work."</TE>

<HD>'Nightline' to Finally Air Congo Series</HD>

<LD>ABC's "Nightline" will try again, starting tonight, to air its
weeklong series on the war in Congo; the series was preempted after
one night because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This is the
first time since then that ABC has felt comfortable blocking out a
week for a non-attack-related story.</LD>
<LD>   It was a foreign story that got bumped from "Nightline," but the
attacks nevertheless set off much media soul-searching, particularly
in TV, about the relative dearth of foreign news on the air, the
result of budget cuts and slim viewer interest. "Nightline" executive
producer Tom Bettag thinks the timing of the Congo reports might work
just as well now.</LD>
<LD>   "People suddenly do realize that what happens overseas can have a
lot of impact on their lives," he says. "We need to remind ourselves
that Afghanistan isn't the only place in the world where there are
huge problems."</LD>
<TE>   And although the link to U.S. lives might not be as direct with
the Congo, he says, "it's just plain interesting."</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, the Congo conflict has killed 3 million people
in three years, or about 2,700 people per day, says Bettag. In
comparison, an estimated 2,893 were killed at the World Trade Center
on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In his introduction tonight, anchor Ted Koppel plans to say:
"These are events you should have heard about on 'Nightline' years
ago," adding that the show is "ashamed of our indifference."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Can hip-hop help fulfill the dream of Martin Luther King Jr.?</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the Hip-Hop Youth Summit, being held today in
Queens, N.Y., think so.</LD>
<LD>   New York state Sen. Malcolm Smith is bringing hip-hop artists
including Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Nas, Queen Latifah, DMX, Sister
Souljah, members of Wu-Tang Clan, Fat Joe and Reverend Run from
Run-DMC together with Def Jam Records chief Russell Simmons and
Source magazine CEO David Mays for the conference.</LD>
<TE>   One element of the conference is an essay contest for young fans
on the theme of how hip-hop can serve King's goal of positive social
change achieved through nonviolent means. "There is no greater role
model for our youth than Dr. King," says Smith, who is co-sponsoring
the event with Hip-Hop Youth Summit founder Charles Fisher and
minister Ben Chavis, executive director of the Hip-Hop Summit Action
Network. "With this summit, we hope to instill that same sense of
commitment to social justice and community that he so courageously
embodied in his all-too-short lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   The youth summit targets teens and preteens with anti-drug
messages and a literacy campaign that will have hip-hop artists
visiting schools preaching the rewards of reading. Smith says the
activities, starting in New York but aiming to go national, are
designed to help kids develop a sense of individual responsibility
for their actions and for the improvement of the quality of life in
their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Today's event is a precursor to a West Coast mini-summit slated
for Feb. 13 and 14 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There's debate within the hip-hop community whether King's belief
in nonviolent civil disobedience is at odds with many rappers' use of
violent imagery and graphic language.</TE>

<HD>Symphony in San Jose Plans Fund-Raisers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The San Jose Symphony, which shut down last fall amid a financial
crisis, is attempting a comeback with concerts to raise funds for its
future operations.</LD>
<LD>   The first of the concerts is set for Feb. 23, though the symphony
is still looking for sponsors to cover the musicians' payments and
other costs, spokeswoman Nanci Williams said. The symphony hopes to
have three or four more benefit concerts in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   The benefit concerts were made possible last week when the union
representing the symphony's 89 musicians agreed to forgo $2.5 million
they were owed for the canceled rehearsals and performances.</LD>
<TE>   Symphony management, now headed by former San Jose Mercury News
Publisher Jay Harris, had told the union that without the concession,
the 122-year-old orchestra would have to file for bankruptcy,
according to Kristen Linfante, a viola player who chairs the union
negotiating committee.</TE>
<TE>   Harris did not immediately return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The union also agreed the symphony could use fewer than 89
musicians in the benefit concerts, Linfante said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the beginning of the return of the symphony, in that
the orchestra will be back on stage," Linfante said. "But I don't
think it's necessarily going to be enough to relieve the debt that
has been incurred or really start a new organization."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra is believed to be the oldest west of the
Mississippi. After years of poor fund-raising left it in debt and
with an endowment of just $1 million, it shut down in October, making
San Jose the biggest U.S. city without a working symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians, who average about $25,000 for 190 performances and
rehearsals a year, have been scrambling to teach more private lessons
and have been playing in other Northern California orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very difficult," Linfante said. "It's a crisis for
many."</TE>

<HD>He Can Be Musical Without Borrowing From Musicals</HD>
<DH>Theater* Don't expect actor James Naughton to reprise his
Tony-winning roles in his cabaret show. He has other things in mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Give 'em the old razzle-dazzle, razzle-dazzle 'em," James Naughton
croons over the phone from his Manhattan pied-a-terre. He has to
leave in a few minutes to see Barbara Cook in her "Mostly Sondheim"
show at Lincoln Center, but he is taking a moment to step back into
the role of Billy Flynn.</LD>
<LD>   Naughton captured a best actor Tony in 1997 playing the slick
lawyer in "Chicago." The character's "razzle-dazzle" style bamboozled
jurors and the press, minted new celebrities and got guilty-as-sin
murder defendants off the hook.</LD>
<LD>   If Naughton is wont to break into Broadway song over the phone,
one might suppose that a good deal of the same is in store during his
five-show cabaret stand beginning Thursday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center's intimate Founders Hall.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, there will be no reprises of his Tony-winning numbers
from "Chicago" and "City of Angels," the 1989 show in which he played
a film-noir detective. There will be no songs from musicals. He says
they sound dull out of context.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great song in ["Chicago"], but not a good one to do
yourself," he said. "Once you've been on stage with seven chorines in
their underwear, singing without them leaves one wanting something
else."</TE>
<TE>   First performed in 1998, Naughton's "Street of Dreams" solo show
is an eclectic affair that includes songs by Duke Ellington, Hoagie
Carmichael, country singer Hank Snow and pop-rock singer-songwriter
Randy Newman.</TE>
<TE>   Naughton says this is his chance to celebrate the musical variety
he has relished since his boyhood in West Hartford, Conn. It also
underscores the varied nature of his career. The Broadway musical has
been good to Naughton, but he has done just three of them in 30 years
as a theater pro. He does not hanker for a fourth.</TE>
<TE>   His first love is drama, not musicals. Naughton's New York debut
came in 1971, when he played Eugene O'Neill's suffering-poet alter
ego in an off-Broadway production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night"
that also starred Robert Ryan, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Stacy Keach.
Classic theater--including a lot of O'Neill, Chekhov and Tennessee
Williams--has been a constant for him.</TE>
<TE>   Now Naughton is building a reputation as a director of classics.
New York critics praised his 1999 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's
"The Price." His next assignment is directing his friend and
Westport, Conn., neighbor Paul Newman in a production of Thornton
Wilder's "Our Town" at the Westport Country Playhouse in June.
Newman's wife, actress Joanne Woodward, is the playhouse's artistic
director; Naughton is an artistic advisor.</TE>
<TE>   At 56, Naughton still gets offers to act in musicals, he says. But
he can't see returning to the grind of performing eight shows a week
for a year at a time. He devoted a year each on Broadway and on the
road to "Chicago" and "City of Angels," and more than a year during
the late 1970s to his other musical, "I Love My Wife."</TE>
<TE>   "The rehearsal process has always been the most satisfying and fun
part of the whole deal for me," he says. "That's where all the
discovery takes place. And then you have to do it over and over
again. That becomes your life, and I have a nice life without it."</TE>
<TE>   Until his junior year at Brown University, Naughton was keen on a
ballplayer's life. He played shortstop and third base on the college
varsity team. But acting and singing always had been in the mix.
After he played a role in a campus production of "Sweet Bird of
Youth," he enrolled in an intensive undergraduate acting course at
Brown, then continued his training at the Yale School of Drama.</TE>
<TE>   His career includes a good deal of television, but he hasn't
landed a role that would make him instantly identifiable. His most
prominent recent credit has been a recurring part as Calista
Flockhart's father on "Ally McBeal."</TE>
<TE>   For many years, he has been a regular performer in the
Williamstown Theater Festival, a summer repertory company in
Massachusetts. There, during the mid-1980s, he played Jim, the
gentleman caller, in "The Glass Menagerie," opposite Joanne Woodward
and Karen Black. He stayed on for the film that Paul Newman directed.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ritchie, the producer at Williamstown, is not surprised
that Naughton is beginning to accumulate high-profile directing
credits. "In 15 years, I don't think I've ever seen him angry, even
in some of the most amazingly pressured situations. He's like the
captain of the ship; he can always see through the storm and help
guide you through it. He's very comfortable in his own skin, and
there's a level of trust that people pick up on."</TE>
<TE>   Naughton's involvement in cabaret began at Williamstown. The
festival includes an informal, after-show cabaret in which cast
members from the featured plays often turn up to sing.</TE>
<TE>   These for-the-fun-of-it solo excursions turned serious in 1997,
when Naughton met jazz pianist George Shearing while they were
performing a tribute to Cy Coleman. Shearing invited Naughton to work
on some material, and suggested that Naughton put together a one-man
show. "I'd been thinking about putting a show together for 20 years.
If the likes of George Shearing thinks I ought to do something about
it, that's the kick in the pants I needed."</TE>

<HD>Networks' Showcases Aim to Improve Diversity Effort</HD>
<DH>Television* Some in the industry welcome the auditions;
others have their doubts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scrambling to increase cultural diversity in the casts of current and
upcoming network television series, ABC, Fox and NBC in the next few
weeks will host several showcases for minority performers who will
audition in front of major executives and casting agents.</LD>
<LD>   The talent showcases, coming on the heels of a similar effort by
CBS, are being coordinated almost a year after the four major
networks were heavily criticized by a multiethnic coalition and other
industry insiders for not moving fast enough in their promises to
diversify prime-time lineups.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the coalition, which includes the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People, the National Latino Media Council,
American Indians in Film &amp; Television and the Asian Pacific American
Coalition, said at the time that the networks had not fully honored
commitments reached in 1999 to increase diversity in front of and
behind the cameras.</LD>
<TE>   Karen Narasaki, head of the coalition, said last week the group
has been working with the networks and their respective heads of
diversity to develop the showcases, and that she is excited about
what she calls a concerted effort by the networks to recruit more
minorities to comedies and dramas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I would have liked to have seen last year, but
there seems to be a clear goal now," Narasaki said. "And the timing
is just right, because casting will soon take place on all the new
fall shows."</TE>
<TE>   But she warned that she wants to see significant results from the
showcases: "We expect to see real change in the new shows, or else
we're going to have a real problem. The new shows will be announced
in May, and we see it as a make or break time for the networks."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the creative minority community are  casting  doubts over
the effectiveness and timing of the showcases. They maintain that a
large pool of veteran talented performers  exists and is looking for
opportunities, but will not be able to take advantage of the exposure
offered by the invitation-only showcases.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the showcases may potentially hurt minority actors and
actresses who want to be judged on talent, not race, others say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very torn by this," said Rose Portillo, a veteran television
screen and theater actress. "Of course there should be creative
opportunities, and I think it's terrific. On the other hand, they are
still pigeonholing people. You must be really Native American or
really Latino. And you're still being judged by the dominant
culture."</TE>
<TE>   Portillo added, "I have watched their flurries of enthusiasm come
so many times. But there's no walk to follow the talk."</TE>
<TE>   Holly Davis-Carter, an agent who has several minority clients,
said the showcases overall are a "good idea. But it really depends on
the overall goal of the network. Is this just for face value or is
there a true effort to bring minority talent to the forefront? There
can be tons of showcases, but at the end of the day, are performers
just going to be back where they are?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis-Carter added, "There is already a pool of talent that gets
overlooked when there are showcases like this, who have been scraping
and pounding the pavement waiting for opportunities. These showcases
are not necessarily open to them. So it somewhat hurts those who have
already been out there."</TE>
<TE>   The multiethnic coalition has also claimed that the networks have
been slow in looking at the existing pool of talent. The group last
year issued "report cards" that contained  low marks for the four
networks in terms of diversity. In overall grades, ABC landed at the
bottom with a D-minus, CBS scored a D-plus, Fox earned a C-minus, and
NBC received the highest grade, a C.</TE>
<TE>   Other criticisms have been leveled at the networks. ABC was
recriticized last week for  its refusal to air a special
commemorating the 25th anniversary of the network's landmark
miniseries "Roots." The special aired on NBC. ABC's newly named
entertainment president Susan Lyne, who was formerly head of specials
and movies, said she apologized for not developing a project that
would have paid tribute to "Roots" in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Executives say more opportunities may be developing for minority
performers next season. ABC has announced it is developing a comedy
revolving around comedian George Lopez. And veteran producer Robert
Halmi Sr. has also announced plans for a $30-million ABC miniseries,
"Dreamkeeper," with a cast that will be made up almost entirely of
Native American actors and actresses. The crew for the project is
also expected to be largely Native American.</TE>
<TE>   The networks are sponsoring the talent showcases  with established
drama groups such as the East West Players and the Robey Theatre
Company,  which are helping to recruit participants. Although
individual networks are sponsoring the showcases, all of the networks
have been invited to attend their rivals' events.</TE>
<TE>   Some showcases have  taken place. ABC held some late last year,
and a couple of Asian American performers were cast in shows such as
"The Practice." CBS and the East West Players sponsored a talent
showcase of Asian American actors earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Golden, CBS' senior vice president of talent casting, said,
"This will be an ongoing effort for us. We're trying to get actors
and actresses across the landscape. We're really trying to cast
colorblind."</TE>
<TE>   ABC will kick off the flurry of showcases Tuesday with a session
in partnership with the Robey Theatre Company, which is co-founded by
actor Danny Glover. The showcase will be followed by a table read
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The network will sponsor another showcase next Monday in
association with Americans Indians in Film &amp; Television, and Native
Voices.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen J. Smith, ABC's vice president of talent development
programs and community initiatives, said, "At our showcase last year
for Asian Americans that we held with the East West Players, we had
standing room only--700 people from the industry who came to see a
very great and broad range of talent. With our 'Dreamkeeper'
miniseries, we're hoping to develop a pool of Native American talent
that the producers can go to immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox is hosting a diversity casting festival this
week to look at African American, Latino and Native American
performers. The festival will include a seminar Tuesday for 200
actors in which senior casting executives from the studio's film,
network and television studio divisions will answer questions. Talent
showcases will take place Wednesday through Friday and next Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to take a more comprehensive approach toward this,"
said Marcia Shulman, executive vice president of casting for the Fox
network. "We want to have an educational process, then the showcase,
then a feedback session where individuals can meet with a casting
director. We felt it was more meaningful to do it in this fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of focusing on more seasoned or trained performers, NBC,
in conjunction with the Laugh Factory, will hold "open mike"
auditions Jan. 29 and 30 for Latino and Asian comedians. Unlike the
other workshops, aspirants who have no experience or agents will get
a chance to perform in front of network executives.</TE>
<TE>   Said Marc Hirschfield, NBC's executive vice president of casting:
"What's different about what we're doing is we're giving
opportunities to talent that has not had the chance to be seen
before. We're really trying to mine for new people."</TE>

<HD>It's a Man's World at KROQ</HD>
<DH>The rock station is No. 1 with listeners in the Southland,
but where are the female artists both old and new?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN CRAUGHWELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KROQ-FM (106.7), the radio station that's been playing on my clock
radio for the last 21 years and on my car radio since I was 16, is,
for the third quarter in a row, No. 1 in the Southland radio ratings.
Hoorah for KROQ!</LD>
<LD>   So why don't I feel like celebrating? Because every time I turn on
the station and listen to new music by Linkin Park, Staind, System of
a Down, Travis, the Strokes, Weezer, Gorillaz and P.O.D. or classic
KROQ hits by Nirvana, U2, the Clash and R.E.M. or even Flashback
Lunch nostalgia schlock by Oingo Boingo, Depeche Mode and Duran
Duran, I'm left with one question.</LD>
<LD>   Where are the girls? When did this town's only alternative rock
station become an all boys' club?</LD>
<TE>   KROQ was my best friend in high school. I listened to Ramondo and
the Blade on the way to school in the morning and Jed the Fish as
soon as school let out. When my 10 p.m. curfew prevented me from
going to all-ages punk-rock shows at Perkins Palace in Pasadena or
the Paladium in Hollywood, it was OK because Rodney "on the Roq"
Bingenheimer gave me my punk fix on Saturday and Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   But the absolute best thing about KROQ in the early 1980s was that
there was no end to the irreverent, witty, angry female voices coming
across those airwaves. Great bands and artists like the Pretenders,
the Go-Go's, the B-52s, X, Patti Smith, Kate Bush, the Bangles, the
Sugarcubes, Siouxsie and the Banshees; New Wave acts like Missing
Persons, Romeo Void, Berlin, the Waitresses, Slow Children and
Bananarama; and even downright silly one-hit wonders like Josie
Cotten, Toni Basil and Moon Unit Zappa.</TE>
<TE>   It was, truly, revolutionary. At the time, the other rock stations
in town, KLOS and the now-defunct KMET and K-WEST, were playing
nothing but "dinosaur rock" like Blue Oyster Cult, Journey, Van Halen
and Foreigner. And KIIS-FM still didn't know that disco was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The late 1980s (i.e., the college years) were even better.
Although there were fewer female acts, the music was more
substantial: Sinead O'Connor, the Cowboy Junkies, Lone Justice (led
by still-teenage Maria McKee), 10,000 Maniacs.</TE>
<TE>   But the 1990s were, for female rockers, a golden age. Women-led
rock bands like Hole, L7, Veruca Salt, Babes in Toyland, the
Breeders, Throwing Muses, Garbage, Belly and the Cranberries as well
as singer-songwriters like P.J. Harvey, Julianna Hatfield, Alanis
Morissette, Sarah McLachlan and Fiona Apple proved that girls could
write, play and rock with the best of them.</TE>
<TE>   KROQ, which in the last two decades has become a bellwether for
radio stations across the United States, helped lead the movement,
adding these women and bands to the playlist and inviting the distaff
acts to play at the station's end-of-summer Weenie Roast concert and
the Almost Acoustic Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes the station's current near-exclusion of female artists
all the more baffling. Currently the only two female-led bands in
rotation on KROQ are the lightweight Orange County group No Doubt and
the Scottish band Garbage.</TE>
<TE>   Even more startling is the fact that on the station's annual New
Year's Eve countdown of the top 107 songs of the year, only one song
by a female artist made the list: No Doubt's "Don't Let Me Down" came
in at No. 57.</TE>
<TE>   Can a revolution really crest, peak and crash that fast? And why
isn't a music industry leader like KROQ doing more to support female
artists?</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last fall, Stryker, the station's popular
weeknight deejay, said the reason behind the testosterone-fueled
lineup is that many of the female-driven rock acts popular in the
1990s either have disbanded or have simply not produced any new
material. "In the entire time I've been at KROQ, Hole hasn't released
one album," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And though there's truth in that argument--many bands, including
L7, the Breeders, Veruca Salt and Babes in Toyland, have broken up at
least temporarily or, like Hole, are caught in legal battles--the
amazing songs that made these bands KROQ listener favorites have been
all but dropped from the rotation, while songs from the same era by
male-led bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilot and
Pearl Jam are heard daily.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As for the lack of new female-led rock acts, it's true that 2001
was not a stellar year. But the albums that did come out, like the
sophomore release from the Canadian death-metal band Kittie and
records from more familiar artists like Garbage and Tori Amos,
apparently failed to make an impression on KROQ's new generation of
listeners.</TE>
<TE>   And listeners, at least the ones tracked by Arbitron, are the
final arbiters of what music makes the cut. Clearly, the new
testosterone-fueled rock format is working, given the impressive
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't help but wish that the powers-that-be at my favorite
radio station would make a more concerted effort to foster female
artists. Surely there is a new crop of female performers who would
benefit from being "discovered" by KROQ the way the Go-Go's were by
Rodney Bingenheimer years ago.</TE>

<HD>Kavafian Feels Blue Over Ravel, Gershwin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Violinist Ida Kavafian announced Friday night that she and her
dauntless pianist Jonathan Feldman were going to try to make the
audience in the lavish Doheny Mansion feel as if they were in a
cabaret.</LD>
<LD>   Well, it didn't feel quite that way, but they did succeed in
pulling off an interesting twist on the old sonata habit that
regulates many a violin/piano recital these days.</LD>
<LD>   Presented by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College,
the program began in 20th century France and ended in the U.S., with
a succession of Poulenc to Ravel to William Bolcom to George
Gershwin.</LD>
<TE>   Kavafian claimed that the entire lineup was influenced by
jazz--which was partly true of the Ravel Sonata No. 2, with its
slithering slow movement marked "Blues," and certainly true of
Bolcom's casual juxtapositions of swinging piano grooves, petulance
and stark tragedy in his Sonata No. 2. (It goes without saying in
Gershwin.)</TE>
<TE>   But to claim a jazz lineage for Poulenc's Sonata for Violin and
Piano was too much of a stretch; like Bolcom, Poulenc veers between
pathos and flippancy, but there is not a jazzy harmony or blue note
to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Kavafian gave Poulenc a robust, aggressive
rendition--not exactly evoking the cabaret. In Ravel, after an edgy
first movement, she serenely followed the bluesy glides and added a
few of her own in the "Blues" movement, her thick tone occasionally
reminding the jazz listener of Stephane Grappelli.</TE>
<TE>   After the Bolcom sonata, where Feldman caught the swing very
effectively, he and Kavafian added a graceful rendition of Bolcom's
"Graceful Ghost Rag"--and the Gershwin tunes, a la Jascha Heifetz's
transcriptions, were the Prelude No. 1, "Bess, You Is My Woman Now"
and "It Ain't Necessarily So."</TE>

<HD>Rivalry Is Set Aside for High-Spirited Tierra Reunion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reunions of middle-aged rock bands can be pathetic spectacles, the
last gasps of lost youth and fleeting fame. But Tierra's reunion
Friday at the Conga Room showed that this band's brand of Chicano
rock ages well.</LD>
<LD>   Not mellow, like wine. But unstable and combustible like a
forgotten stash of fireworks. In two rollicking sets, Tierra
celebrated its 30th anniversary with the vigor of a band that still
had something to prove.</LD>
<LD>   Which it did. Up until the last minute, it wasn't certain the
original Tierra could come together at all under its perpetually
quarreling co-founders, Steve and Rudy Salas. The East L.A. siblings
had a final falling out years ago and now front two rival Tierra
bands. Despite several attempts, nobody had been able to bring the
bickering brothers together again until Friday's concert, negotiated
only as a temporary cease-fire.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of causing a meltdown, the old tensions served to ignite
the evening. At one point early in the show, Rudy pretended to
assault his younger brother, muttering something about the stage not
being big enough for both of them. To which Steve cracked: "Yeah,
because we all gained weight."</TE>
<TE>   They may be paunchy, jowly and gray, but these 10 guys still sound
sharp on their trademark mix of R&amp;B, salsa and swing, which helped
define the Eastside sound. Rudy, the more reserved one, played a mean
lead guitar, for a guy who plucks every note with his thumb. Steve,
who's more of a ham, played timbales and sang soulful lead on hits
such as 1980's "Together," reprised for adoring fans who turned the
night into a tipsy tailgate party.</TE>
<TE>   The band was clearly having a blast as well. The brothers even did
a few silly dance steps together before the night ended in a joyful
jam session, joined by other Tierra members who were in the audience.
The reunion proved its point: In the history of Chicano pop music,
Tierra is truly worth celebrating.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez's Double Duty, Mixing and Matching</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latin jazz was in the air Saturday night with performances by an
impressive array of artists: the Jazz on the Latin Side All-Stars and
Poncho Sanchez (leading two ensembles) at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman
Fine Arts Complex and Eddie Palmieri, Flora Purim and Airto Moreira
at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The Luckman program was yet another entry in this attractive
venue's effort to establish itself as an important jazz destination.
It began with the Jazz on the Latin Side All Stars--literally a stage
full of players, featuring such highly visible artists as saxophonist
Justo Almario, drummer Alex Acuna, pianist Donald Vega, conguero
Francisco Aguabella, trombonist Andy Martin, trumpeter Ramon Flores
and flutist Danilo Lozano (to name only a few).</LD>
<LD>   The All-Stars, initially organized by KLON-FM disc jockey Jose
Rizo, have become a kind of ad hoc Latin jazz ensemble, the personnel
occasionally shifting, but the creative level always high. On this
occasion, they were outstanding.</LD>
<TE>   Romping through material from their first two albums--including
"Descarga Borgers" and "Mamacita Caravana" (both dedicated to KLON
personnel) and "Mujer Chicana"--as well as newer material, including
Lee Morgan's "Caramba" (arranged by David Torres) and Dizzy
Gillespie's "Bebop" (arranged by Francisco Torres), the group's
soloing was as scintillating as their crisply performed ensemble
passages. (It's worth noting, however, that the utterly inadequate
sound mix--overemphasizing the percussion--made it difficult to hear
the harmonic textures and the brisk accenting of the horns.)</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, announcing that he had decided to start the new year by
diversifying his musical activities, performed with two distinct
supplements to his basic group. The first was the Ortiz brothers
band--Sanchez called the combination "Potiz"--emphasizing danceable
traditional rhythms, energized by the tres playing of Eddie Ortiz and
the irrepressible singing of Alfred Ortiz, especially in the high
spirited changui, "Venga A Bailar Bailadores."</TE>
<TE>   Switching gears dramatically for his second ensemble, Sanchez
turned toward the Crescent City to assemble something he called his
New Orleans Gumbo Band. With the singing and harmonica playing of
Dale Spalding front and center, Latin rhythms became the seasoning
for an eclectic stew simmering with blues licks and Cajun
rhythms--yet another example of the surprisingly simpatico results
that can be achieved by mix-and-match musical blending.</TE>

<HD>In Terms of New TV Series, It's as if Sept. 11 Never
Happened</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sept. 11, as we all know by now, changed everything, slapping us out
of our superficial, xenophobic stupor and bringing in a new era of
sobriety and wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, Sept. 11 really hasn't altered anything, and we're the
same old society of callow satyrs and unquestioning slaves to
celebrity we used to be.</LD>
<LD>   With the news camp leaning to the former side and the
entertainment camp to the latter, the country's highest-ranking
television executives took turns offering those seemingly conflicting
views in appearances before reporters at the Pasadena Ritz-Carlton
Hotel the past two weeks.</LD>
<TE>   It was a dichotomy perhaps reflective of a nation yearning for
benumbed normalcy but recognizing that something in the body public
still throbs. Or maybe it only meant that TV is, like most of us, a
little befuddled.</TE>
<TE>   The news folk, of course, are hopeful that they'll be able to
maintain their inflated budgets, enlarged and younger audiences, and
renewed importance within their organizations and the country,
Geraldo Rivera and female anchors promoted as "sexy" notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   In the hotel ballroom that was the nexus of this oddball event,
officially known as the Television Critics Assn. winter press tour,
network news leaders ranging from ABC's Barbara Walters to CBS News
President Andrew Heyward recounted their own Sept. 11 experiences as
if they were still fresh.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Walters said she'll be doing her first
celebrity interview since September (Celine Dion), and such
executives as MSNBC news chief Erik Sorenson dared speak of
demographics in news ratings, which raises the troubling specter of
judgments being made only after calling a consultant to see which
story speaks loudest to baby boomers.</TE>
<TE>   Suits from the entertainment side of the business, not eager to
have to think all of a sudden of new ways of imagining and making
television series, said that after the initial shock and aftershocks,
they have not seen a profound Sept. 11 impact on programming. As if
to prove it, they served up panels of actors and writers from one
traditionally insipid new show after another.</TE>
<TE>   Even a seemingly high-minded series on preview in Pasadena, the
CBS Supreme Court drama "First Monday," managed to trivialize the
doings of the high court by injecting sports metaphors, bodily
function "humor" and randy young clerks.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, with a movie script about United Airlines Flight 93--the
plane seized by terrorists that crashed in rural Pennsylvania--in the
works, and Fox were the only networks to acknowledge overt Sept.
11-related content in their non-news programming.</TE>
<TE>   Fox retooled its March show "The American Embassy" because the
already-shot pilot ended with a bomb exploding at said building in
London. So the former "Emma Brody," the story of a young woman's
self-discovery, gets a new name and becomes the larger tale of the
place in the world of America, its embassies and, yes, the young
woman.</TE>
<TE>   The more telling measure is in the series being developed for next
season, because most of those are post-Sept. 11 products. And the
shows coming through the door, said one head programmer after
another, are not essentially different in tenor from the ones that
came through last year.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of news might be soothing but is not necessarily
encouraging. At a session this week for a stultifying future WB show
called "The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star," the
bewilderingly self-satisfied cast seemed intent on making the room
understand that there is a connection between rock and sex.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been, as one critic leaned over to whisper, 1971. It
certainly could have been Sept. 10, 2001.</TE>

<KH>THE GOLDEN GLOBES</KH>
<HD>Gold Rush</HD>
<DH>Baz Luhrmann's musical 'Moulin Rouge' and Ron Howard's
drama 'A Beautiful Mind' are multiple winners--and likely Oscar
favorites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ and SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A film delving into the darkness of mental illness and a vibrant yet
tragic period musical won top honors at the 59th annual Golden Globes
ceremony Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Universal/DreamWorks' film "A Beautiful Mind" won four awards,
including best drama for its depiction of mathematical genius John
Nash's battle with schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   "You found a way to do the hardest thing--to make the mind a
visual experience," said the film's producer, Brian Grazer, referring
to his friend and partner, Ron Howard, who directed "A Beautiful
Mind."</LD>
<TE>   Australian Russell Crowe won best actor in a drama for his
portrayal of Nash. This was the first Golden Globe win for Crowe, who
won the best actor Academy Award last year for director Ridley
Scott's "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   "'A Beautiful Mind' is just a movie," said the bearded Crowe to
the audience at the Beverly Hilton. "It's just a piece of
entertainment at the end of the day, folks. But hopefully it opens
our hearts, gives us more understanding and compassion and the belief
that in our lives something extraordinary can always happen."</TE>
<TE>   Baz Luhrmann's colorful musical "Moulin Rouge" won best musical or
comedy feature. Luhrmann, another Australian, said he was ending a
five-year journey bringing the musical, a neglected genre in
Hollywood, back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, Luhrmann said his musical wasn't a throwback to
old-fashioned Hollywood musicals. Rather he said, "It's really
looking back to the past into the future to find a solution to music
cinema now."</TE>
<TE>   The film also won best actress in a musical or comedy for
Luhrmann's fellow countrywoman, Nicole Kidman, and best original
score.</TE>
<TE>   There have been many instances when the Academy Awards and the
Golden Globes have not agreed on nominations or winners. But with
their wins, "A Beautiful Mind" and "Moulin Rouge" can be considered
front-runners for the Academy Awards, which take place March 24 at
the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Sissy Spacek, donning a conservative black suit and her
trademark red hair in a bun, won best actress in a drama for her role
as the uptight, grieving mother in Miramax's "In the Bedroom."
Spacek, who broke into film in the early 1970s, has received several
critical honors for the film, including best actress from the Los
Angeles Film Critics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so blessed to get to do what I love to do and to work with
so many wonderful people, but the best part of all is that I get to
go home to my precious family," said Spacek, 52.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that surprised the man himself, 76-year-old Robert
Altman won best director for his ensemble murder mystery satire
"Gosford Park." Altman is the oldest winner in the directing category
since John Huston won at 79 for "Prizzi's Honor."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm whelmed, I'm overwhelmed ... I don't know what a best
director is," said Altman. " ... I feel that [the actors] do the work
and I get to watch, and nothing is better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Altman, who was first nominated for a Golden Globe in this
category for 1970's "MASH" and was last nominated for 1992's "The
Player," thanked USA Films for leading an aggressive publicity
campaign for the $13-million film. "And for me to say this is a lot,
they are doing a terrific job," said the notoriously maverick
director, who has bucked the studio system in favor of more
independent fare.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman, who was accompanied by her mother and father, won for her
role as the doomed courtesan Satine in "Moulin Rouge." Kidman, who
won a Golden Globe six years ago for "To Die For," experienced one of
her most successful years professionally, but a turbulent one
personally with the end of her 10-year marriage to Tom Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really, really special because I never thought I would be
in a musical, let alone win an award for one," said a nervous Kidman,
who admitted her teeth were chattering. "I think when you win an
award, you think, 'Hmm, it's not about me in a way, it's about the
people who helped you get here.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gene Hackman won best actor in a comedy or musical for his role as
an errant father in Wes Anderson's offbeat dark comedy of a
dysfunctional family, "The Royal Tenenbaums." Hackman, who did not
attend the ceremony because he missed his flight connection while in
the Caribbean, was named best actor by the National Society of
Critics earlier this month for "Tenenbaums." The 71-year-old actor
won his last Golden Globe in 1992 for "Unforgiven."</TE>
<TE>   In the supporting category, the awards went to understanding and
long-suffering spouses.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Connelly won for her role as Alicia, the loyal wife of
John Nash in "A Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my gosh that was fast!" said a breathless Connelly, who was
the first person to win an award Sunday night. The actress, whose
career began as a child actress in the mid-'80s in such films as
Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America," made a reference to her
4-year-old son, saying, "I am a better actor and a human being
because of you."</TE>
<TE>   Englishman Jim Broadbent took home his first Globe for his
performance as the husband of Alzheimer's disease-stricken writer
Iris Murdoch in "Iris."</TE>
<TE>   Broadbent has been singled out by critics for his performance in
"Iris," as well as for his role as the colorful nightclub owner
Harold Zidler in "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   In the screenwriting category, Akiva Goldsman won for "A Beautiful
Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "It's my very first award ever," said Goldsman, whose hands were
shaking violently as he read his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Armstrong won for best original score for "Moulin Rouge,"
while rock star Sting received best original song honors for
"Until..." from "Kate &amp; Leopold."</TE>
<TE>   America's leading box-office star, Harrison Ford, was honored with
the Cecil B. DeMille Award for career achievement. The 59-year-old
actor has starred in some of the biggest blockbusters in American
cinema, including the "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark"
franchises; "Witness," for which he received his only Oscar
nomination; and the thriller "The Fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Globes are sponsored by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Assn., an organization of about 80 writers and part-time journalists
who vote on all the categories. In the past decade, as the Globes
were broadcast on a major network and as celebrity-driven media
coverage increased, the awards grew in stature.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the event's reputation has been tarnished in the past
by questionable dealings among members of the Foreign Press--who are
flown to junkets and are wined and dined by the studios--it has
become an important barometer for the Academy Awards. In the last
decade, winners of the Golden Globes have become favorites for the
Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   While the movies dealt mainly with sober topics, on the red carpet
it was business as usual. Stars were glammed up and fans in the
bleachers were screaming to catch their attention.</TE>
<TE>   On the television side, HBO dominated the evening, winning six
Globes, including best drama for the unlikely series set in a
mortuary, "Six Feet Under," and best comedy series for the saucy "Sex
and the City." The cable network also won best miniseries or movie
made for television for the Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg-produced World
War II epic "Band of Brothers."</TE>
<TE>   HBO also picked up honors on the acting front with Sarah Jessica
Parker of "Sex and the City," Rachel Griffiths for "Six Feet Under"
and Stanley Tucci in the World War II drama "Conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Garner won for best actress in a drama for her role as a
double agent in ABC's freshman series "Alias," beating out veterans
such as Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco of "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   The offspring of two popular actors each took home best actor
honors. "Spin City" star Charlie Sheen won for best actor in a comedy
series and Kiefer Sutherland best actor in a dramatic series for
Fox's "24," over such favorites as Charlie Sheen's father, Martin
Sheen, for "The West Wing" and James Gandolfini of "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a sober acid trip," said the 36-year-old Sheen, who
has been in and out of drug rehab.</TE>

<HD>'Black Hawk' Flies Into Hollywood Battle</HD>
<DH>Box Office*  Gritty tale of Somalian incident takes in $29
million. Disney's 'Snow Dogs' holds a strong second place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has developed into an
extension of the profitable Christmas season, and this year was no
exception.</LD>
<LD>   "Black Hawk Down," Ridley Scott's grueling epic about a daylong
battle in Somalia, captured a potent $29 million in its first three
days in 3,101 theaters after a feisty limited engagement beginning in
late December to qualify for Academy Award consideration.</LD>
<LD>   The "Black Hawk" number might have been even higher but for the
Saturday football playoffs and a snowstorm, which curtailed
attendance in major East Coast cities. Including the $2 million from
limited release, "Black Hawk" should have a total of $34 million by
tonight.</LD>
<TE>   For the movie's distributor, Sony Pictures, that's welcome news
after the stinging disappointment of its "Ali," which has grossed
less than $60 million. "Black Hawk's" performance so far is
impressive for a movie with no real stars, as is the breakdown of the
audience, about 55% male but an encouraging 45% female, according to
Sony senior executive Jeff Blake.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprisingly strong second place was the Disney family film
"Snow Dogs," starring Cuba Gooding Jr., which got the cold shoulder
from critics but a warm reception from audiences with an estimated
$17.5 million in 2,302 theaters, knocking all family movies except
"Lord of the Rings" out of the top 10. A Disney senior executive
attributes the strong showing to sneak previews the previous weekend,
which tapped into the film-going audience's strong appetite for
family fare.</TE>
<TE>   Even with four movies grossing $11 million or more this weekend,
attendance was down about 16% from last year's holiday weekend,
according to the box office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations.  Next
weekend brings four new national releases: the thriller "The Mothman
Prophesies," starring Richard Gere; the swashbuckler "The Count of
Monte Cristo"; the martial arts spoof "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"; and
the teen romance "A Walk to Remember."</TE>
<TE>   After four weeks at the top, "Lord of the Rings" declined to third
place, with a fifth weekend total of approximately $13 million in
3,266 theaters and about $246 million so far in the U.S.,  and well
more than $500 million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's a waiting game until the Academy Award nominations Feb.
12. If "Lord" scores multiple nominations, particularly a best
picture nod, the three-hour epic will get a hit of adrenaline and
could challenge even the mighty "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," which has grossed almost $310 million in the U.S. and is
approaching $900 million globally, putting it in the company of such
mega-blockbusters as "Jurassic Park" and "Star Wars: Episode I The
Phantom Menace."</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's heart-tugging drama about one
man's battle over paranoid schizophrenia, starring Russell Crowe, was
in fourth place, with an estimated $11 million for the three days
(Universal estimates the film will add an additional $2 million
today) in 2,225 theaters. In its third weekend of general release,
"Mind" has earned $75 million, with Oscar season still ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The teen comedy "Orange County" held on sufficiently well in its
second weekend, taking advantage of the college recess, with about $9
million in 2,317 theaters and a sweet 10-day total of abut $27
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Ocean's Eleven"  took in an estimated $5.7 million in 2,670
theaters, and more than $170 million to date. "The Royal Tenenbaums"
is proving to be an offbeat hit with $4.3 million predicted for the
weekend, in just less than 1,000 theaters, and about $36 million to
date. As one of the rare romance movies around, "Kate &amp; Leopold,"
starring Meg Ryan, is hanging in with $3.4 million in 2,381 theaters
in its fourth weekend, for a total of about $42 million.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Altman's comedy/mystery "Gosford Park" reached ninth place.
Now on 658 screens, the film enjoyed an uptick to $3.3 million, for a
total of more than $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 10th place, "Vanilla Sky" added an additional $3 million, in
2,355 theaters, to top $93 million.</TE>

on our screens, so why not ballets that evoke or grow from other
ballets?</LD>
<LD>   Three recent home-grown works performed Saturday by Dance Theatre
of Harlem at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts not only
challenged the dancers' technique and stamina, but also used the
company's classical heritage as the basis for new creativity.</LD>
<LD>   Lowell Smith's "A Pas de Deux for Phrygia and Spartacus" proved
the most obvious example of this process, adopting the narrative
context and Khachaturian score of an enduring Russian beefcake ballet
but defining a more intimate and even playful relationship for its
two title characters.</LD>
<TE>   Best known as one of the company's most powerful principals, Smith
made fearsome demands on his warrior-hero--heroic solos one moment,
sky-sweeping lifts the next--and Duncan Cooper added his own nobility
of bearing and dramatic intensity to the role on Saturday night. Tiny
Melissa Morrissey danced with the same faultless control and
emotional spontaneity that she had displayed in the "South African
Suite" duet at the matinee, but Russian women traditionally bring a
greater expressive weight to Phrygia than she displayed.</TE>
<TE>   Both Laveen Naidu's "Viraa" (which means "brave" in Sanskrit) and
Robert Garland's "New Bach" took inspiration from the company's roots
in the Balanchine repertory and neoclassical style. Each began as a
plotless, formal showpiece featuring a corps and a central couple,
but soon adopted Balanchinean strategies for reflecting and
interpreting the music in unpredictable ways.</TE>
<TE>   Using Ernest Bloch's mercurial Concerto Grosso #2, "Viraa" added
twisty contemporary accents to an already formidable neoclassic
vocabulary, as well as incorporating bold gestural images: the
women's preening pose, for instance, with hands behind their heads.
But Naidu's response to the score also resulted in a number of
emotional statements that never quite became a story but gave each
sequence a distinctive mood--exactly as in Balanchine's "Serenade."</TE>
<TE>   So the dynamic Andrea Long and the buoyant Eric Underwood
sometimes simply stared at one another as the corps surged around
them Saturday evening, and in their duets she seemed just as likely
to tenderly caress his face or hug his shoulders as straighten up for
complex textbook finger-turns.</TE>
<TE>   Underwood and Caroline Rocher led the cast of "New Bach" at the
matinee, comfortably embodying the stylistic extremes that Garland
developed out of the experiments in Balanchine's own Bach ballet,
"Concerto Barocco," and other works. Accompanied by Bach's Violin
Concerto in A minor, they and their corps colleagues danced with
majestic classical composure--until something in the music triggered
idiosyncratic outbursts: shoulder-wiggling, hip-rolling, arm-pumping
and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Akin to the breezy athleticism of Paul Taylor's modern dance
interpretations of Baroque music, these brief passages caught
something in the music beyond its formal perfection, something
eternally fresh and free.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, then, "New Bach" tried to convey both the elegance of
ballet dancing and the less restrained impulses underpinning
it--Apollo versus Dionysus, if you like.</TE>
<TE>   A returning favorite, the eight-part "South African Suite," also
thrived on contrasts between different kinds of movement--in this
case, the linear elegance of ballet and the multifaceted physicality
of traditional African dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographed in 1999 by Naidu, Augustus van Heerden and company
co-founder/director Arthur Mitchell, it enlisted nearly two dozen of
the company's finest artists in depictions of everything from animal
motion to tribal warfare to African social dances without ever
becoming too solemn or too scattered in total effect.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing to a diverse selection of mostly African music, Dionne
Figgins, Paunika Jones, Akua Parker, Mark Burns, Ikolo Griffin, Kevin
Thomas and Cooper led the cast with great spirit and authority,
though nobody matched the impact of Christiane Cristo with her
spectacular contortions on pointe.</TE>

<HD>'Jacques Brel' Is Alive and Well in Ventura</HD>
<DH>In 1968, this show introduced much of America to the French
troubadour. It returns in good hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacques Brel hasn't been alive and well for 25 years--the Belgian
troubadour died at age 49 in 1977. But some of his famous melodies
live on in a vigorous Ventura revival of the revue that introduced
his work to most Americans: "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris."</LD>
<LD>   One of America's most devoted keepers of the Brel flame, Moni
Yakim, is director of the Rubicon Theatre Company production at the
Laurel Theatre, just as he was of the original 1968 off-Broadway
revue.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Yakim staged the Brel show in this area, at Pasadena
Playhouse in 1988, the title was reduced to "Jacques Brel Is ... ,"
perhaps to emphasize the timelessness of his work.</LD>
<TE>   However, a couple of the show's most prominent moments now feel
inescapably dated. This is most evident in the opening number,
"Marathon," which moves rapidly through mid-20th century history and
ends with a predicted vision of what the present era would be like.
At least in the English translations by Eric Blau and Mort Shuman, we
were supposed to be using robots and taking interplanetary vacations
by now. How quaint.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the second act, "The Bulls," evolves into an
antiwar number that stops abruptly in Saigon. That probably seemed
brash in 1968, but now it sounds antiquated.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most of the other songs deal with more evergreen themes.
Brel/Blau/Shuman's heart-on-sleeve tendencies create a few creaking
lines, but more often the lyrics effectively crystallize dramatic
moments and strong passions. Brel's simple, repetitive melodies rely
on propulsive rhythms to whip up the sense of occasion.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubicon production is blessed with two veterans of the
off-Broadway and Pasadena productions, George Ball and Amanda
McBroom.</TE>
<TE>   Ball's long and elastic face and big voice energize such solos as
the jaunty "Mathilde," "Jackie" and "Funeral Tango," as well as the
more harrowing "Next" and the first-act finale, "Amsterdam."</TE>
<TE>   McBroom, the well-known cabaret singer and composer, uses a more
restrained style to heat up her big numbers, such as the haunting "My
Death," "Sons Of," "Marieke," "No Love, You're Not Alone" and the
concluding, tongue-twisting "Carousel." (Because of a commitment on
the East Coast, McBroom will be replaced by Eileen Barnett in the
production's concluding week, Feb. 13-17.)</TE>
<TE>   Ball and McBroom are a married couple in real life, and so is the
cast's younger pair, Stan Chandler and Kirsten Benton. Since he came
to prominence as one of the original Plaids in "Forever Plaid,"
Chandler has expanded his vocal and dramatic range remarkably. Here
he shines in the moving "Alone," and he demonstrates why the
character in "Bachelor's Dance" is still a bachelor. He makes two of
the score's weaker numbers, "Statue" and "Fanette," stronger by
virtue of his carefully crafted interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   Benton doesn't get as many star turns as the others, but is
appealing in "I Loved" and as a shrewd observer of the others in "Old
Folks."</TE>
<TE>   Yakim's choreography generally enhances the songs. But Abra
Flores-Paudler's costume design doesn't add much and, in McBroom's
case, slightly lessens the overall level of sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris," Laurel
Theatre, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.;
Saturdays-Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Feb. 17. $28-$38. (805) 667-2900.

<HD>No C-SPAN Is Bad News for L.A. Viewers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY SNOW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As one cable network, TNN, unveils its new half-hour series of
tabloid fodder "The Conspiracy Zone," the real conspiracy in Los
Angeles may be the ongoing threat to a well-informed citizenry.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, C-SPAN aired a weeklong special series reviewing the
causes and consequences of the Enron bankruptcy, the largest in U.S.
history. Trouble is that about 400,000 homes in the Los Angeles area
whose cable company is Adelphia Communications didn't have the option
of watching these programs when they re-aired in the heart of the
West Coast prime-time hours.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 1, Adelphia dropped C-SPAN and C-SPAN 2 from its
prime-time schedule in order to add two new commercial broadcast
stations to its lineup. Adelphia's explanation, that it was forced to
add these stations as part of an FCC-mandated "must carry" rule,
means little to those of us whose refrain is "thank God for C-SPAN."</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia has promised to reinstate C-SPAN in a "timely" fashion,
which means at least a month after the Enron special. But missing the
Enron series in prime time is just the beginning. The nation remains
at war in Afghanistan, important briefings on national security flow
out of our nation's capital almost hourly, and a national mid-term
election year has begun. It is hard to imagine a more critical time
in our country's history for unfettered access to policy debates and
call-in programs that feature "real" citizen-callers, instead of
spinning pundits and paid analysts. Rather than maintain that access,
Adelphia has short-circuited it in the nation's second-largest media
market.</TE>
<TE>   With its decision this month to cut back C-SPAN, Adelphia brings
into question any claim it might make of being a "responsible
corporate citizen." The message, instead, that Adelphia sends to L.A.
residents is that C-SPAN, with its unique contribution to educating
citizens, is expendable. The nation, or at least 400,000 cable
subscribers in greater Los Angeles, can just do without serious
information in a time of great national consequence.</TE>
<TE>   A quick glance at Adelphia's station lineup reveals what a
troubling decision this is. Local viewers can browse multiple
shopping channels, watch endless infomercials, but at 7 each evening
they can forget about seeing the U.S. Senate, briefings by the
secretary of Defense, footage from the campaign trail, public policy
forums, author readings on the weekend "BookTV" and any of the other
public affairs events C-SPAN distributes to citizens every day.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one shouldn't single out Adelphia. Its decision to cut
back C-SPAN is just a sign of a growing trend in prime-time
television lineups, fast becoming the exclusive domain of the
corporate sponsor. We the viewers, with our "eyeballs for sale," are
being brokered between television networks and the major advertisers
who are losing all scruples about where and when to embed market
messages. It's not enough to take a break or channel-surf during a
commercial. Now advertisers and marketers seek to reach us in a
seamless environment known as advertainment.</TE>
<TE>   C-SPAN, with its advertising-free programming, is a definite
threat to the embedded marketing concept of television. A place where
citizens can gather in a commercial-free zone is fast becoming
obsolete. And once it's gone, try getting it back.</TE>
<TE>   The joke about C-SPAN is that "it dares to be boring," as if
watching educational and public affairs content is like watching
grass grow. It's true that there is an element of the snooze factor
in watching some policy briefings. I even tell my students that
C-SPAN allows one to get in touch with your inner nerd.</TE>
<TE>   The real joke, however, may be on those of us who continue to
believe that a well-informed citizenry is both needed and wanted. It
would seem that the American public, as Walter Lippmann projected, is
a phantom, replaced by a demographic and market share.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a proposal. Let's call it Coca-Cola C-SPAN and show members
of Congress sipping products of their soft drink sponsor. McDonnell
Douglas could bring Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's briefings to
us. The advertising possibilities are endless.</TE>

Lamb, teaches at USC's Annenberg School for Communication. She can be

<LD>In the United Kingdom, Stephen Lawrence's name is seared into the
national consciousness in much the way that Rodney King's or James
Byrd's names are here in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man, was stabbed to death by a gang
of white teenagers while he waited for a bus in their southeast
London neighborhood. The April 1993 attack fanned racial tensions,
and the police were taken to task when the suspects walked free.</LD>
<LD>   "The Murder of Stephen Lawrence," a re-creation of that incident,
has been widely seen in England and reaches American television
tonight as a presentation of PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre" (9 p.m. on
KCET and KVCR). Since the film was aimed at viewers familiar with the
events, it allows numerous informational gaps that may frustrate U.S.
watchers. What's all too recognizable, however, is its depiction of
prejudice left to simmer.</LD>
<TE>   The movie is said to stick close to documented facts.</TE>
<TE>   To make them come alive, writer-director Paul Greengrass adopts
the common documentary technique of following his actors with
hand-held cameras. The attack on Lawrence (Leon Black) is a shaky
blur, as though the cameraman is also fleeing the assault. Subsequent
scenes in the Lawrence household (headed by Marianne Jean-Baptiste
and Hugh Quarshie as Stephen's shellshocked parents) are awkwardly
shot through doorways or over shoulders, and in some scenes, ambient
noise all but drowns out what's being said. Though it's an
artistically provocative approach, it further disorients viewers who
don't know the story.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a couple of hours spent with this movie might be an
appropriately reflective activity on this Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday.</TE>

<KH>Sundance Festival</KH>
<HD>Women and Their Stories Merit Prizes</HD>
<DH>'Personal Velocity' takes the top award. 'Real Women Have
Curves' and 'Daughter From Danang' are also honored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Women, as subjects and behind the camera in documentaries and
dramatic features, were very much in the majority when the Sundance
Film Festival announced its prizes at a Saturday night event that,
apparently for economic reasons, did without a closing party for the
first time in memory.</LD>
<LD>   "Personal Velocity," the stories of three women (Parker Posey,
Kyra Sedgwick and Fairuza Balk) leaving troublesome relationships
with deeply clueless men, won the dramatic grand jury prize. Written
and directed by Rebecca Miller, who wrote the short stories the film
is based on, "Velocity" also took the cinematography award for Ellen
Kuras, who has now won the prize an unprecedented three times,
including once for Miller's previous Sundance feature, "Angela." The
film will be released by United Artists.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe this, I just can't believe this is happening,"
said an ecstatic Miller, who thanked her husband, actor Daniel Day
Lewis, for his help in the editing room and in watching their child,
as well as her parents (playwright Arthur Miller is her father) "for
letting me move into their house and cut the film in their barn."</LD>
<TE>   Also winning two prizes, including the coveted dramatic audience
award, was HBO's "Real Women Have Curves," set in the Latino
community of East L.A. and directed by Patricia Cardoso. This warm,
affirmative effort, a pleasant surprise among the usual Sundance
detritus of films about addled slackers and women who bark like dogs,
explores the conflicts between a bright, ambitious high school
graduate and her caustic, difficult mother. Co-stars America Ferrera,
a 17-year-old L.A. resident, and the veteran Lupe Ontiveros shared a
special jury prize for acting and wept in each other's arms when
accepting the award.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been trying to get my first feature made for 10 years; there
were many times when I was ready to give up and be a farmer or
something," said director Cardoso. Co-screenwriter (with George
LaVoo) Josefina Lopez, whose play was the basis for the script,
thanked HBO: "I wrote this when I was 19 but it took 11 years to get
made because no one had the courage to show real women on the
screen."</TE>
<TE>   On the documentary side, the grand jury prize went to "Daughter
From Danang," directed by Gail Dolgin and Vicente Franco, which
explores how unexpectedly wide was the cultural gap between a
Vietnamese American woman who was adopted by a U.S. family when she
was 7 and the Vietnamese family she reunites with 22 years later.
Franco thanked "our protagonists: They opened their lives to our
cameras at moments so intimate we didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The only documentary to take two prizes was Lee Hirsch's "Amandla!
A Revolution in Four Part Harmony," a stirring examination of the
role music played in South Africa's battle against apartheid, which
earned the documentary audience award and the Freedom of Expression
award.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as frustrated as observers were by the dramatic
competition's absence of completely realized films on the order of
last year's "Deep End," "In the Bedroom" and "Memento," the jury
overcompensated by handing out awards to numerous films. The dramatic
directing award went to Gary Winick (one of the producers of
"Personal Velocity") for "Tadpole," to be distributed by Miramax, a
lightweight sex farce about a sophisticated 15-year-old boy who has a
wicked crush on stepmother Sigourney Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award was Gordy Hoffman for
"Love Liza," acquired by Sony Pictures Classics, which stars his
brother, Philip Seymour Hoffman, in a bravura performance as a
husband who takes refuge in sniffing gasoline fumes when his wife
commits suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from its award to "Real Women," the dramatic jury gave out
two more special jury prizes. One, for ensemble cast, went to seven
actors from "Manito," written and directed by Eric Eason, a gritty
cinema verite drama about a Latino family's hard times in Manhattan's
Washington Heights. And one for originality went to "Secretary,"
directed by Steven Shainberg and starring Maggie Gyllenhaal as a
young woman whose life brightens up when she welcomes the sadistic
attentions of attorney James Spader.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most satisfying features at Sundance didn't win
anything, such as Finn Taylor's hard-to-classify "Cherish," one of
the dramatic competition's better films. A whimsical screwball comedy
linked to a dark stalker scenario, "Cherish" (to be distributed by
Fine Line) details the relationship between a woman under house
arrest (Robin Tunney) and the man who comes to check her electronic
bracelet (Tim Blake Nelson).</TE>
<TE>   Though it screened outside the competition, "Coastlines" was one
of the strongest and most involving dramatic films at Sundance,
showing once again why Florida-based Victor Nunez is the most
impressive of regional filmmakers. "This is where I'm from," he said,
"this is the only way I know how to make films." A thoughtful
melodrama about the dislocation caused when a hunk of an ex-con
returns to the small town where the sheriff and the sheriff's wife
are his best friends, "Coastlines" mixes sense of place and the
texture of everyday life with a menace-laden narrative about wanting
to emotionally have it all.</TE>
<TE>   On the documentary side, Rob Fruchtman and Rebecca Cammisa took
the directing award for "Sister Helen," about a holy terror of a
Benedictine nun who began a halfway house for recovering addicts in
the South Bronx. Filming the feisty sister, said Fruchtman, was "like
riding a wild pony." Added Cammisa, "we just basically showed up and
she let it rip."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel B. Gold won the excellence in cinematography award for
"Blue Vinyl," which was co-directed by Judith Helfand and himself.
Helfand, whose previous Sundance documentary "A Healthy Baby Girl"
won a Peabody Award, has constructed that rare muckraking film with a
sense of humor. Motivated by her parents' decision to put vinyl
siding on her childhood home, Helfand and Gold take a personal and
scientific look at the perils of manufacturing and disposing of what
some people call "the most environmentally hazardous consumer product
on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary panel also gave out some special jury prizes. One
went to documentary veteran Lourdes Portillo for "Senorita
Extraviada," her investigation into the mysterious slayings of
between 200 and 400 young women in Juarez, Mexico. And another went
to John Walter's "How to Draw a Bunny," a droll look at elusive,
enigmatic underground figure Ray Johnson, sometimes known as "the
most famous unknown artist in America."</TE>
<TE>   Not getting a prize but deserving one was Kristi Jacobson's
"American Standoff," a deeply human, surprisingly heartbreaking look
at a long and bitter ongoing strike the James P. Hoffa-led Teamsters
are waging against Overnite, a powerful and union-hostile trucking
company. Produced by Barbara Kopple, "Standoff" tells the always
emotional stories of workers willing to give up everything they have
for what they believe in.</TE>
<TE>   Though the documentary field was especially strong this year, it
doesn't justify one of the best documentaries in the festival, Lucy
Walker's "Devil's Playground," being sadly left out of competition.
Not only does "Playground" enter the rarely filmed Amish community,
it deals in a poignant way with a little-known custom called
rumspringa, where 16-year-old Amish kids are allowed to experience
the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll of the outside world before deciding
whether to give themselves to their restrictive church forever. This
examination of the life-changing question one teen calls "to be or
not to be Amish" is haunting, provocative and unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Shown as a work in progress was "Only the Strong Survive," the
latest documentary by veterans Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker,
which, like a vibrant American "Buena Vista Social Club," captures
the performances of legendary rock and rhythm and blues stars like
Wilson Pickett, Mary Wilson, Jerry Butler and Rufus and Carla Thomas,
singers whose infectious music remains everything it ever was.</TE>
<TE>   Documentaries also did well at the rival Slamdance Festival. "My
Father, the Genius," Lucia Small's look at her dad, architect Glen
Howard Small, was picked as the best documentary, while the audience
feature award and a special jury honor went to Mark Moskowitz's
documentary "Stone Reader," about the director's search for the
vanished author of a highly praised novel.</TE>
<TE>   The best dramatic feature was Eitan Gorlin's "The Holy Land,"
about an Israeli rabbinical student who falls in love with a
prostitute. (Some of these films will be shown at the American
Cinematheque's "Best of Slamdance" program at the Egyptian Theater on
Feb. 6 and 7.)</TE>
<TE>   It remained for director John Waters, a member of the Sundance
dramatic jury, to put things in perspective. After listing several of
the weird pastimes of characters in competition films, Waters tartly
theorized that "if we didn't act this out on film instead of in
person, we'd all be in prison. And this wouldn't be a film festival
but a parole board hearing."</TE>
<TE>   Amen to that.</TE>

<HD>Outdated Structure or Certified Landmark?</HD>
<DH>Architecture* Oklahomans rally around the Gold Dome, even
though it's not by Buckminster Fuller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM UNDERWOOD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>For its fans, there's no place like dome.</LD>
<LD>   The Space Age half-sphere dazzled photographer Keith Ball when it
went up one year after Sputnik did.</LD>
<LD>   Then a Cub Scout from Seminole, Okla., he thought a glimmer from
its gold roof was a magic sign that the big city was near.</LD>
<TE>   Todd Scott's mother worked there when she was a new high school
graduate and it was Citizens State Bank. Now Scott, an architect,
uses it to find his house from an airplane's window.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody uses it to give directions in this part of town," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Gold Dome, as it's known to locals, is without direction
of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Its corporate owner has asked permission to demolish the
43-year-old building it says is too big and in need of almost $2
million worth of repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Bank One's regional spokesman, Chris Spencer, said an inspector's
recent look found as much plugs as roof. "He said we have so much
plastic up there we, in essence, have a second structure," Spencer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Schehing, the company's Oklahoma president, said the dome has
seven times the space Bank One needs for its planned branch.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a building that has used up its useful life," Schehing
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank One's plan to take out the dome and sell more than half of
its lot to a drugstore chain has prompted weekly protests from dozens
of pickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching them blow up Oklahoma City since the '60s and
I'm sick of it," said Ball, a frequent picket.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters have taken their cause to a Web site, released a song
on the Internet and plastered billboards and bumper stickers around
the city.</TE>
<TE>   It's somewhat amusing to Bob Roloff, the architect who designed
the dome.</TE>
<TE>   "It created a stir," he said. "I'm sort of astounded to see it
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The retired architect said the dome is not the first or the third
in the country, as some have claimed. "I have a personal problem with
it being called architecturally unique when it is not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Historic Preservation Office has declared the dome
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places even though it
hasn't been around for the standard 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Architectural historian Jim Gabbard said the dome is significant
because businesses rarely used domes. The structures' main uses were
military buildings or exhibition halls, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gabbard said he has had to debunk some myths surrounding the dome.
It was not, for example, designed by visionary architect Buckminster
Fuller.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, after studying such natural patterns as honeycombs, is
credited with inventing the interlocking panel system that resembles
what is now used in the international space station's unfolding solar
collectors.</TE>
<TE>   The architect believed in the idea so much that he thought a dome
several miles in diameter could be built over New York City to
shelter its residents from bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a dream, and he was trying to show this dream could be
done," Gabbard said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons the dome is worth keeping, he said, is because
it is evidence of this scientifically optimistic era so different
from today.</TE>
<TE>   Roloff said the bank leaders who hired his firm intended for the
dome to be dismantled after an unspecified number of years. The same
process used to assemble the 625 diamond-shaped panels could be
reversed to take them apart, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they can make everybody happy by moving it somewhere else,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schehing said the company, which inherited the building in a 1997
acquisition, is willing to donate the 20-ton dome to the community if
it can be assembled elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Bank One has postponed its demolition request while the options
are considered. It has said this will probably be the final delay.
The banking company gave the building a reprieve this summer and
sought another buyer for the dome. A deal with a local pain remedy
manufacturer fell through.</TE>
<TE>   John Yoekel, chairman of a committee created by the city to come
up with a solution, said he doesn't think relocation would have the
peacemaking effect Bank One wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a good-faith attempt," he said, but added that he
has told the company it could end up being "a daily reminder that you
moved a landmark structure that [residents] wanted to keep."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Yoekel, president of a local oil and gas production
company, said he's optimistic that another use can be found in the
next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have a save for a change," he said. "We've told them we're
in uncharted waters here. We've never saved a landmark in Oklahoma
City before. Please give us time."</TE>

<LD>Glamour took an elegant turn on the red carpet at Sunday's Golden
Globes, as stars celebrated the first major awards show of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's another example of America getting back to normal," said
Marg Helgenberger, who wore a black Valentino corset top and long
skirt.</LD>
<LD>   Several actresses, such as Lorna Luft, Peri Gilpin and Debra
Messing, wore the gowns they had originally planned to wear to the
Emmy Awards until the event was downscaled because of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Messing playfully described her navy Oscar de la
Renta ball gown as fit for "an Upper East Side girl gone bad."</LD>
<TE>   Fittingly for an event created by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Assn., some of the night's stunners choose European designers: Nicole
Kidman and Audrey Tautou, both in black Yves Saint Laurent; Halle
Berry in a bronze beaded Valentino; and Tilda Swinton in a sleek
black Victor &amp; Rolf.</TE>
<TE>   Tuxedos were the rule for men, though Simon Baker and Sting tossed
their ties. Though many stars wore classic black, most felt like
celebrating Hollywood and all it stands for, even if times are
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy war-torn," said Jane Kaczmarek, in colorful Cantu and
Castillo, "so I'm going to be silly glamorous."</TE>

<HD>William Kraft 'Quips and Quotes' From Some of the Masters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>Santa Barbara</DL>
<LD>SANTA BARBARA--Composer William Kraft was asked to fulfill an odd,
but not uncommon, request in his recent commission from the Santa
Barbara Symphony. The task was to create a concert opener somehow
relating to other works already on the program--the Brahms Second
Piano Concerto and Sibelius' Second Symphony. The situation might be
analogous to that of a decorator assigned a small corner of a large
room, whose extant decor won't budge.</LD>
<LD>   With a wry touch, Kraft created "Quips and Quotes: A Sacrilegious
Homage," which was given its premiere Saturday at the Arlington
Theater in Santa Barbara. Though less than 10 minutes long, it duly
warmed the ears and mind.</LD>
<LD>   Opening with a tenuous sense of tonality, the work could go either
way, into dissonance or consonance, but stays intriguingly
noncommittal, in a satisfying gray zone into which fleeting quotes
are dropped. Wisps of Brahms, Sibelius, Mahler and hints of
Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" float by, but the effect is mostly
impressionistic, in a piece that yearns to be longer.</LD>
<TE>   In the main body of the program, the symphony made robust music
under maestra Gisele Ben-Dor's guiding hand. With the Brahms, the
local academic connection continued: Kraft has taught at UCSB for
more than a decade, and pianist Jerome Lowenthal lands here each
summer to teach at Music Academy of the West. Though a bit fumbling
at first, Lowenthal warmed up as he went through the Concerto, and
the orchestra had its own showcase in Sibelius' Second, creating an
engaged accounting that was alternately expansive and focused.</TE>

<HD>Quite a Double Whammy</HD>
<DH>AFC playoffs: Dominant performance by Steelers in 27-10
victory leaves defending champion Ravens humbled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Elvis has left the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   And he has taken the defending Super Bowl champions with him.</LD>
<LD>   The Pittsburgh Steelers lost star running back Jerome Bettis
during the pregame warmup, but they didn't lose their focus or
determination, going on to blow out the Baltimore Ravens, 27-10, in
an AFC divisional playoff game Sunday at Heinz Field in front a
Terrible Towel-waving record sellout crowd of 63,976.</LD>
<TE>   Pittsburgh will play host to Sunday's AFC championship game
against the New England Patriots. Baltimore, the trash-talking team
American loved to hate a year ago, will have to lower the decibel
level until it can retool.</TE>
<TE>   Or do what Raven tight end Shannon Sharpe did Sunday, turn the
trash talk on his own team.</TE>
<TE>   "The game wasn't really that close," Sharpe said. "It could easily
have been 40-10 or 45-10."</TE>
<TE>   Bettis, who had missed five games because of hip and groin
injuries, suffered an adverse reaction to an injection by the medical
staff 45 minutes before the game for the groin injury, causing
numbness in one leg.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't slow the Steelers. With Amos Zereoue taking over
as the primary back, Pittsburgh came up with more than enough offense
to end the Ravens' season. Zereoue rushed for a game-high 63 yards
and two touchdowns, and quarterback Kordell Stewart completed 12 of
22 for 154 yards and a touchdown, enabling the Steelers to hold onto
the ball for 40 minutes 45 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "All year, this football team has not been about one individual,"
said Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher.</TE>
<TE>   Of course most offenses are going to look pretty impressive when
they share the field with the league's top defense. And Sunday, the
Steelers looked every bit as good as their ranking against a Raven
offense that looked every bit as bad as advertised.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore running game was pitiful. The team gained a total of
22 yards, leading rusher Terry Allen barely making it into double
figures with 11 yards in four carries.</TE>
<TE>   Raven quarterback Elvis Grbac, with Steeler helmets in his face
all day, finished with 18 completions in 37 attempts for 153 yards.
He had three passes intercepted and the Steelers also had three
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We got pride man," said Pittsburgh safety Lee Flowers. "Don't
cross the 50 [yard line] unless you plan to do something.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about their running game and they got 22 yards today.
Now they got a long off-season to work on that running game."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Sharpe.</TE>
<TE>   "This lets us know we don't have the offense we need," Sharpe
said. "It's very frustrating. We don't have the people we need to get
the job done."</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious early Sunday that Baltimore was not going to get
the job done. The Ravens didn't get a first down until the second
quarter. They were successful on only one of 12 third-down conversion
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Steelers kept putting points on the board.</TE>
<TE>   When Pittsburgh's first drive stalled, Kris Brown was successful
on a 21-yard field-goal attempt. Zereoue scored twice from a yard out
and, when Brown connected from 46 yards out, it was 20-0 with 3:46
left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh's defense seemed to have an answer for anything the
Ravens tried. When Baltimore cornerback Chris McAlister came up with
an interception late in the first quarter, it should have meant a
momentum shift.</TE>
<TE>   Especially with the ball on the Pittsburgh seven-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   But two plays later, Steeler safety Brent Alexander respond- ed
with an interception of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Stover's 26-yard field goal in the final minute of the half
at least assured the Ravens they would not suffer the ultimate
embarrassment of a shutout.</TE>
<TE>   But they were looking for more than only a way to reduce the
shame. And they hoped they had found it in the third quarter when
Baltimore's Jermaine Lewis fielded a punt at his 12, cut across the
field and raced down the right sideline to the end zone untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The 88-yard return was the longest in NFL postseason history,
surpassing the 84-yard return of the Minnesota Vikings' Anthony
Carter in 1987 against the New Orleans Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' run, however, was to be the Ravens' last gasp.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately they had to turn the ball back over to their offense.
And that proved not to be a viable option.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers closed out the scoring in the fourth quarter with a
32-yard touchdown pass from Stewart to Plaxico Burress.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Baltimore defensive tackle Tony Siragusa, who
can trash talk with the best of them, was so choked up, he had
trouble speaking.</TE>

<LD>New England (12-5) at Pittsburgh (14-3)</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, 9:30 a.m., Channel 2</LD>
<LD>   How they got there: The Steelers had a first-round bye as AFC
Central Division champions and defeated Baltimore, 27-10, in a
divisional playoff game. The Patriots received a first-round bye as
AFC East Division champions and beat the Raiders, 16-13, in a
divisional playoff game that went to overtime.</LD>
<TE>   2001 meetings: None. Pittsburgh leads the all-time series, 12-5.
New England won the last meeting, 23-9, at Pittsburgh, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Common opponents: Pittsburgh 5-1, New England 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   About Pittsburgh: After losing their opener, the Steelers
steamrolled through the rest of their schedule, losing only two more
games by a total of six points. Pittsburgh's strengths are simple: a
smothering, playmaking defense and a powerful rushing offense that
remained atop the NFL despite a nagging groin injury to star runner
Jerome Bettis. Jason Gildon and rookie standout Kendrell Bell led a
defensive unit that topped the league in total defense, rushing
defense and sacks. The re-emergence of quarterback Kordell Stewart
coupled with the growth of receivers Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress
balanced the run-oriented attack with just enough of passing to keep
opposing defenses on their heels. Running backs Amos Zereoue and
Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala proved to be able backups in Bettis' absence.</TE>
<TE>   About New England: At 0-2 with star quarterback Drew Bledsoe
severely injured, receiver Terry Glenn embroiled in a multitude of
personal problems, and patchwork offensive and defensive lines, the
Patriots seemed to be in dire straits. Enter Tom Brady to the rescue,
an untested quarterback who had only three passing attempts on his
NFL resume prior to this season. In what turned out to be the story
of the year, Brady was not only a solid replacement, but he remained
the starter after Bledsoe returned and was chosen to go to the Pro
Bowl while guiding the Patriots to an 11-3 record. Buffalo reject
Antowain Smith contributed greatly with 1,157 yards.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>The Bus had no doubt he was going to be back on the road Sunday. But
just to be sure, he was going to get a little extra air in his tires.</LD>
<LD>   Pittsburgh Steeler running back Jerome Bettis, hampered by hip and
groin injuries over the previous five games, suited up for Sunday's
divisional playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   But about 45 minutes before the opening kickoff with Bettis still
feeling tightness, he was given an injection to the affected area.
The needle, however, hit a nerve, causing numbness that lasted about
five hours.</LD>
<TE>   "He would have been ready by then," said Steeler Coach Bill
Cowher, "but I don't think the network was going to let us move the
game back five hours."</TE>
<TE>   Bettis tried to remain upbeat in the face of the realization he
would be a spectator Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold them down, baby," he told his replacement, Amos Zereoue.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really broken down," Zereoue said. "He wants to go out
there. He's a football player."</TE>
<TE>   Cowher said there is no reason to think Bettis won't be ready for
Sunday's AFC championship game against the New England Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Tim Lewis felt the Ravens' status
as defending Super Bowl champions made it more difficult for them to
accept the one-sided nature of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "When champions fall behind," Lewis said, "it can get real
frustrating for them. It was like it was for Mike Tyson. Today, the
Baltimore Ravens were biting their own ear."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens' 22 rushing yards are the second-lowest total allowed
by the Steeler defense in team history. Pittsburgh held the Minnesota
Vikings to 17 rushing yards in Super Bowl IX in 1975.</TE>

<HD>Capriati Masters Spin Control</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: She adjusts to opponent's finesse game and
powers into the quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>When the new-generation power game of Jennifer Capriati squared off
against the old-school European backhand slice of Rita Grande, the
contrast, quite frankly, appeared to send the defending champion
spinning in the second set.</LD>
<LD>   Grande took pace off the ball, and prolonged the rallies, taking
advantage of heavy conditions created by the closing of the roof of
Rod Laver Arena because of inclement weather. Her touch and tactics
looked out of place today at the Australian Open, like a
black-and-white TV program on cable.</LD>
<LD>   For legend Billie Jean King, doing television commentary for an
Australian network, it was like the appearance of an old friend. She
was excited about the Italian's creativity.</LD>
<TE>   "[Capriati is] playing somebody who is playing like she was in the
1970s," King said. "What's going on here? Jennifer's not used to
this."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati adapted to the circumstances, showing patience and
endurance. She and Grande combined for a crowd-pleasing second-set
tiebreaker and the top-seeded Capriati prevailed, winning the
fourth-round match, 6-3, 7-6 (9), in 1 hour 36 minutes. Grande,
seeded 20th, lost it on a tough note, double faulting on match point.</TE>
<TE>   It was suggested there was some luck involved and Capriati sounded
slightly annoyed.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky? No, not at all," she said. "I worked very hard for that
and it was a bad ending. But I think I earned that. It could have
gone either way. It wasn't all on that point, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Their competitiveness, combined with the 6-0, 4-6, 7-5 victory by
No. 7 Amelie Mauresmo of France against German Marlene Weingartner,
was of some relief to WTA officials. Earlier, Marcelo Rios of Chile
criticized the women's tour for lacking depth, and his words were
prophetic Sunday when there were four one-sided fourth-round matches.</TE>
<TE>   As for Rios, he seemed oblivious to the continuing controversy. It
certainly did not impact his form or clever shot-making ability in a
7-5, 6-1, 6-4 victory against Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador in the
fourth round. Rios, who has dropped one set in four matches, will
play either No. 7 Tommy Haas of Germany or No. 11 Roger Federer of
Switzerland in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Haas became the first player to take a set from Federer, winning
the opener, 7-6 (3), in their closely contested fourth-round match.
Federer won the second set, 6-4, and the third, 6-3. Haas forced a
deciding set by taking the fourth, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Rios remarks provoked a sharp response from
Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   "Even today this match proved his comments were pretty wrong,
pretty ridiculous," Capriati said.</TE>
<TE>   Rios said he found support among his colleagues in the men's
locker room. He also felt that his remarks were misrepresented.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to start arguing about what anybody thinks," he
said. "I just said what I thought and in the locker room everybody
agreed. [Amanda] Coetzer is 12th in the world and she loses, 6-0,
6-0, in 20 minutes. It is ridiculous what is going on in women's
tennis and I think everybody agrees."</TE>
<TE>   Rios said he only was critical of the lack of depth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying guys are better than girls and all that," he said.
"I said I think until the quarters, girls win too easy."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed amused to be the center of attention and suggested that
Venus Williams have a rematch against Karsten Braasch. In 1998 , the
chain-smoking German played Venus and Serena Williams in consecutive
sets here, beating Serena, 6-1, and Venus, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   "Just tell Williams to tell Karsten Braasch he can play her again,
like she did three years ago," Rios said. "He is playing a little bit
better now, so she's going to have a little trouble. Maybe 6-0 now."</TE>
<TE>   That's the beauty of sport: another day, another match. The
closeness of fourth-round matches did not extend to Justine Henin and
Elena Dementieva. The sixth-seeded Henin, of Belgium, reached the
Australian Open quarterfinals for the first time, defeating the
12th-seeded Russian, 6-0, 6-3. Dementieva has struggled since her
breakthrough season two years ago, failing to get past the fourth
round of a Grand Slam since reaching the U.S. Open semifinals in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, Henin will play either her countrywoman, No.
4 Kim Clijsters, or Janette Husarova of Slovakia. Henin vs. Clijsters
would be a rematch of their French Open semifinal last year.
Clijsters won after Henin led, 6-2, 4-2.</TE>

<HD>Dooling Frustrated by Slow Recovery</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper guard Keyon Dooling continues to rehabilitate his sprained
left ankle, but it's not progressing as fast as he would like.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really frustrated," he said. "I want to play. It's hard to
even watch the games. I still feel a part of [the team]. I still get
into the locker room trash talk."</LD>
<LD>   But he hasn't played since he was injured Nov. 14 against the
Chicago Bulls. He has never been sidelined for more than a few games,
but has been out for 33 now.</LD>
<TE>   "A week or two at the most," he said. "I had the flu last season."</TE>
<TE>   No return date has been set, but Dooling said, "We're still hoping
for sometime in February. Hopefully, before the All-Star break. Or
just after it."</TE>
<TE>   With Dooling out, Jeff McInnis has handled almost all of the
point-guard duties, averaging a team-leading 36.6 minutes (and 13.6
points, second-best on the club).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Darius Miles often seems much older and wiser than his 20
years, particularly during postgame comments.</TE>
<TE>   After the Clippers' late rush Saturday against the Portland Trail
Blazers trimmed a 38-point deficit to 20 by game's end, he said, "We
didn't want to be on SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Clippers' 3-14 road record, he said, "We don't
have energy or intensity on the road. I'm one of the players who is
supposed to come off the bench and bring intensity, so I feel like
it's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Miles had a season-high 20 points (on seven-for-11 shooting and
six of eight free throws) in the Clippers' 113-93 loss to the Trail
Blazers. He also had 18 points last week in a loss against the
Minnesota Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom, who sat out Saturday's game because of a sprained
right wrist, is said to be questionable to play tonight against the
Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Odom has been battling the injury since taking a hard fall Dec. 16
against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry has been pleased by the improvement of center
Michael Olowokandi, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds against
Cleveland for his seventh double-double this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He may not be Shaq-like," Gentry said. "[But] if he continues to
work and improve, he'll be in this league a long, long time as an
effective player."</TE>

<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>

<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 20-21, Nuggets 12-27.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Nuggets--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Denver is having a brutal season, and now guard Nick Van
Exel says he wants out of town. The Nuggets are said to be trying to
accommodate him. Last week, a Denver Post columnist called for the
team to dump Van Exel and center Raef LaFrentz. Meanwhile, the
Nuggets are even worse than the Clippers on the road, dropping to
2-15 after a loss Saturday at Seattle. Antonio McDyess, Denver's best
player, has not played since undergoing surgery to repair a torn
tendon in his left knee Oct. 12.</TE>

<HD>'Small' McDonald Is Making a Big Impact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center Andy McDonald was the one thing the Mighty Ducks can remember
fondly from a lost weekend in Edmonton and Calgary.</LD>
<LD>   There were no victories to look back on, but back-to-back losses
to the Oilers and Flames can't be laid on McDonald's doorstep. Not
even team captain Paul Kariya created so many scoring chances.</LD>
<LD>   Only exceptional goaltending by the Oilers' Tommy Salo kept
McDonald from scoring Friday. Roman Turek could not deny him the
following night.</LD>
<TE>   The diminutive McDonald lurked in the slot, took a pass from Oleg
Tverdovsky, and zipped a shot into the upper left corner of the net,
giving the Ducks a 1-0 lead in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   He had three shots in the first period, all good chances. He had
six in Friday's game, including five in the second period that took
acrobatic saves by Salo to keep out.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good, small player, no question about it," Coach Bryan
Murray said. "Maybe he's more than a good small player. Maybe he's
just a good player. You can take the qualifier off Andy McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the best player the last two nights for us."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has performed well centering the Ducks' top line with
Kariya and a winger-to-be-named most nights. He has four goals and 15
points in 23 games since being recalled from minor-league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   His goal Saturday gave him four points in the last six games. "I'm
trying to stay positive because we're doing the right things to get
chances now," McDonald said. "It's bad news because we're not
scoring. We got to turn those chances into goals."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's speed has been a good fit on the top line with Kariya
and his size has not been much of an issue.</TE>
<TE>   He battled Calgary's Robyn Regehr throughout Saturday's game,
holding his own in a mismatch. McDonald is generously listed at 5
feet 10, 186 pounds. Regehr is 6-3, 226 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He got his face rubbed by Regehr two or three times," Murray
said. "But the kid never quit. I thought he was tenacious. He created
all the scoring chances that line got against Edmonton and Calgary.
He battles in the corners and behind the net."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Kings, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--XTRA (710), KSPN (1110).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Ducks 14-28-6-3, Kings 21-18-7-2.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Kings--0-1-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Ducks are 1-9-1-0 in their last 11 games. It took 90
points to make the playoffs in the Western Conference last season.
For the Ducks to get to 90 points they can't lose more than four of
their last 31 games. The Kings are 7-2 in their last nine games, but
are coming off a 3-2 loss to the New York Islanders. King defenseman
Mathieu Schneider has no goals and one assist and Ziggy Palffy has
four goals and seven points in nine games since they returned from
injuries.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Kite completed a wire-to-wire victory in the PGA Senior Tour's
MasterCard Championship on Sunday, shooting a five-under-par 67 to
beat John Jacobs by six strokes at Kaupulehu-Kona, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   Kite, 52, birdied seven of the final 15 holes to finish at
17-under 199. Jacobs shot a 68.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Wadkins shot a 68 to finish third, seven strokes behind.</LD>
<TE>   Kite played the wind successfully by using his accurate iron-play
to reach the greens. He's the top player in greens in regulation
since joining the senior tour.</TE>
<TE>   Kite three-putted the first hole for a bogey, but quickly
recovered. His only other bogey was on No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The shot of the tournament was Jacobs' double-eagle on the
566-yard 10th hole.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justin Rose of England shot a seven-under 65 to win the Dunhill
Championship at Johannesburg, South Africa, by two strokes for his
first European PGA Tour victory.</TE>
<TE>   Rose finished at 20-under 268. He tied for fourth in the 1998
British Open as a 17-year-old amateur, then immediately turned pro
and missed the cut in his first 22 tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen closed with a 65 to share second place with
England's Mark Foster, who shot a final-round 69 and South Africa's
Martin Maritz, who had a 71.</TE>

<HD>Mickelson Gets His Vacation Pay</HD>
<DH>Golf: After taking five months off, he defeats David
Berganio in playoff to win Hope Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>Yes, it had to happen: Phil Mickelson doesn't play a single PGA Tour
event in five months, has to send out a search party to find his
clubs, uses a broom to clear off the dust, then tees it up at the
$4-million Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, plays 90 holes in 30 under par
and wins $720,000 with a victory on the first playoff hole.</LD>
<LD>   So, what's the meaning of this? It's that you don't forget how to
play golf in five months.</LD>
<LD>   Late August to late January is a long time for a break for a
professional golfer, who makes his living by actually playing golf,
not by hanging out at home with his family. But that's just what
Mickelson has done. He has made a mockery of the off-season and of
having to be tournament tough. What Mickelson brought to this
expansive desert golf playground were booming drives, razor-sharp
irons, inventive wedge shots to the green and an increasingly
effective method of coaxing golf balls into holes using the putter.</LD>
<TE>   Add it all up and Sunday heralded Mickelson's comeback, a
near-perfect closing 64 at the Palmer Course at PGA West and a birdie
on the first extra hole to turn back David Berganio. Tied for 10th
when the fifth and final round begun, Mickelson toured the course in
eight birdies and no bogeys. He didn't get into the lead until the
89th hole. He birdied the last three holes in regulation, then
birdied the 91st hole to wrap up his 20th PGA Tour victory in the
first tournament of his 10th full year as a pro. His rounds of
64-67-70-65-64 added up to a total of 30-under 330.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mickelson had no trouble explaining how he did it.
"I've played golf, 29, 30 years, so it's not like I'm going to forget
how," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a challenging day, though."</TE>
<TE>   That was true for everyone. Mickelson climbed over 10 players in
front of him with his shiny closing round, one in which players were
making moves in both directions. Briny Baird, who had a 64, moved up
from 18th to third, tied with Cameron Beckman, who finished with a
69. Jerry Kelly finished alone in fifth with a 67 and a 27-under
total of 333. Charles Howell ended with a seven-under 65 and was four
shots back in a tie for sixth with Justin Leonard, Kirk Triplett,
Deane Pappas, Brandel Chamblee, Kenny Perry and Chris DiMarco, who
had an unfortunate bogey-bogey finish.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, 54-hole leader Jay Haas shot a 39 on the back, finished
with a 74 and tied for 16th. Berganio was busy moving in the other
direction. He was just one under after nine holes, but made eagle at
the par five 11th and added three more birdies on his way in. The
last one was a six-foot putt for birdie on the 90th hole that
Berganio steered straight in to tie Mickelson with a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson's last three holes in regulation were downright classic.
He birdied the 16th with a putt from 10 feet that broke about two or
three feet off the slope. At the 17th, his pitching wedge left him 25
feet short, but he made that putt, too. And at 18, he hung a
four-iron out and it just cleared the water, but landed in the rough.
From there, he flopped a wedge to about four feet and made it again.
"It wasn't the easiest finish, where I had a bunch of tap-ins, but I
felt like I was able to get it done and that's what I'm pleased
with."</TE>
<TE>   The playoff hole was 18 again and while Berganio drove it straight
down the middle, Mickelson found a bunker on the right side. He hit a
seven iron out and had 80 yards left. But Berganio chunked a two-iron
from 206 yards and it never reached the green, landing in the water
in front of the green instead. After Berganio finally got it on the
green, Mickelson asked him to mark his ball. The plan was for
Mickelson to bounce it off the small hill on the green and get it to
roll back down to the hole. A little more than a tap-in later,
Mickelson had his birdie and another victory in his successful
career.</TE>
<TE>   Berganio, a Buy.com scrambler who has been on and off the PGA Tour
in his career, is still searching for his first victory in the big
leagues. "I've just got to keep trying, keep being persistent," said
Berganio, who is from Sylmar. "I'm going to win and I know it, that's
all that matters.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say, 'I got beat by the best.' I didn't play in Asia
and Australia and beat a bunch of guys nobody knows. I want to beat
the best. I'm not afraid. Phil doesn't scare me. He's a very nice
guy, but I'm ready to play ... 30-under, that's pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   And so was Mickelson's 30-under. His $720,000 payday moved him
past $18 million, trailing only Tiger Woods and Davis Love III. It
also served notice to Mickelson that all the work he did in the
off-season on his short game paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a year that I've been very much looking forward to," he
said. "The reason I'm so excited about winning this tournament is ...
because what I've specifically set out to work on paid off this
week."</TE>
<TE>   It only took five months off to find out, too. Once the word of
this gets out, see how many other players plan extended vacations
between seasons.</TE>

<HD>Affluent Wins by  a Nose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her sire is Affirmed, who won the most famous three-race series of
them all. A year after Affirmed's death, Affluent is one victory away
from a sweep that is even rarer than winning horse racing's Triple
Crown.</LD>
<LD>   In 1978, Affirmed became the 11th--and last--horse to sweep the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. Affluent,
winner of Sunday's $150,000 El Encino Stakes, needs a win in the La
Canada on Feb. 9 to win Santa Anita's series for 4-year-old fillies,
which has been swept only twice before. The only other fillies to win
the La Brea, El Encino and La Canada were Taisez Vou in
1978--Affirmed's Triple Crown year--and Mitterand in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Affluent won the La Brea by 11/2 lengths over Royally Chosen three
weeks ago, but her winning margin over the same rival was much closer
Sunday. The nose decision was the closest El Encino outcome in 20
years. In a ding-dong battle over the final eighth of a mile, Eddie
Delahoussaye was able to shoehorn Affluent through on the rail. Only
the courage of the jockey and the athleticism of the horse got the
chestnut filly to the wire without bouncing off the fence.</LD>
<TE>   Royally Chosen, in front all the way, had a one-length lead on
Affluent at the eighth pole. On the outside, Alex Solis whipped
Royally Chosen right-handed and made the inside path as legally
uncomfortable as he could for Affluent and Delahoussaye.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just enough room," said Delahoussaye, 50, who won his
first of three El Encinos in 1981. "At the eighth pole, Alex shifted
over on me and made it pretty tight. At the sixteenth pole, it was
still pretty tight. Then in the last three or four jumps it opened up
a little bit. I thought I'd gotten the other horse right on the wire,
and my eyes are still pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the Hollywood Oaks last July, the versatile Affluent
has won four of five starts, one of them on grass. Her only loss
during this spell was a second to Golden Apples in the Del Mar Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's matured," said Delahoussaye, who began riding her
midway through last year. "The timing was right. I just got on her at
the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Ron McAnally's filly, bred and owned by Jan Whitham, paid
$3.80 as the favorite and earned $90,000. The time was 1:42 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   A 48-1 shot in the La Brea, which was her first graded stakes
race, Royally Chosen was the third choice Sunday. She finished five
lengths ahead of Sea Reel.</TE>
<TE>   The previous Sunday, McAnally had won the San Gorgonio Handicap
with Tout Charmant; Affluent gave him his third stakes win of the
meet.</TE>

<LD>Jockey Chris McCarron won't have a heavy workload on this holiday,
but two of his three mounts are in stakes races today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Long one of the best money riders in the game, McCarron has big
shots in the $150,000 Santa Ynez and the $150,000 San Marcos
Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   In the Santa Ynez, a Grade II at seven furlongs for 3-year-old
fillies, McCarron will ride Candor for owners Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss
and trainer Ron McAnally. He'll ride Lord Flasheart in the San
Marcos, a Grade II at 11/4 miles on turf, for owner Ed Gann and
trainer Bobby Frankel.</LD>
<TE>   A winner only once in five starts, Candor, a daughter of Crafty
Prospector, will benefit from an anticipated fast pace in the Santa
Ynez.</TE>
<TE>   Ayanna, the morning-line favorite, is extremely speedy and has won
three of her five races around one turn. She does face pressure from
Rich Musique, who has won two in a row for trainer Vladimir Cerin in
wire-to-wire fashion.</TE>
<TE>   If those two go crazy up front, Candor could be along in time
under McCarron. On New Year's Eve, she was beaten a half-length at
20-1 by Rich Musique and now she gets an extra sixteenth of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   While Candor is looking for her first stakes win, Lord Flasheart
is a proven commodity. In his U.S. debut Dec. 30, which came after a
layoff of more than 18 months, Lord Flasheart won cleverly,
overcoming a slow start to beat another highly regarded import
(Straight Flush) by a length. This will be his first race at 10
furlongs, but he won going 13/8 miles in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, McCarron's third and final mount today is Chapeau, a
3-year-old Deputy Minister filly making her first career start in the
ninth race.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: There are more than a few quality betting races
on the card. The fourth is a wide-open turfer for older expensive
claimers and the seventh and ninth are maiden races featuring some
promising youngsters and fast-working rookies.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Hemet Thought. The gelding has three wins in a row
since joining the Bill Spawr barn and will go for another in today's
third at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Praise Be To God. The 8-year-old gelding is one for 34
in his career, has been beaten a combined 1091/4 lengths in his last
five starts and figures to get pounded again in today's eighth at
Turf Paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four using Luna Negra and Honestly
Darling in the sixth, Spitfire Man and Sunday Break in the seventh,
singling Lord Flasheart in the eighth and using Pali Princess, Miss
Tropics and Oriana's Magic in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 5/58. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $29.40/$380. Total money bet: $342.</TE>

<HD>Infection Affecting Allison's Performance</HD>

<LD>Slump-ridden center Jason Allison, who has failed to score in eight
of the Kings' last 11 games, is suffering from a sinus infection that
has hindered his play for several weeks, team trainer Pete Demers
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's admitted that it's affecting his performance," Demers said,
"and we have to rest him as much as we can and let the medication
work."</LD>
<LD>   Allison, acquired along with Mikko Eloranta in an Oct. 24 trade
that sent Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray to the Boston Bruins, failed
to score in three of his first four games with the Kings. But the
rugged center then scored in 20 of the next 24, becoming the
point-a-game player the Kings expected.</LD>
<TE>   His late goal against the Phoenix Coyotes on Dec. 26 gave the
Kings a 1-1 tie and extended his career-long point-producing streak
to nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, the former Bruin captain has scored only one
goal and three assists in 11 games, though his playing time has not
decreased noticeably. He leads the Kings with 32 points, among them
23 assists, in 39 games.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, who stayed home from practice Sunday, has suffered from
congestion for weeks, Demers said, and has been prescribed
antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect it to go away," Demers said, "but we expect that it's
going to take some time. We don't have any handle on it at this
point. It might take some time, but we hope the medicine is going to
help him. It might be a few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher, who suffered a concussion in Thursday night's
4-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, returned to practice and said it
would be decided this morning whether he can play tonight against the
Mighty Ducks at the Arrowhead Pond.... Mattias Norstrom and Craig
Johnson, who left Saturday's 3-2 loss to the New York Islanders
because of stomach flu, sat out practice but Coach Andy Murray said
he expected them to play tonight.... The Kings, whose .902
penalty-killing percentage is the NHL's best, have not led the league
in penalty killing since the 1974-75 season.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ready or Not, Shaq Is Due Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since December 21, a month ago today, Shaquille O'Neal has played
five full basketball games and three-quarters of another, at which
point he got ejected and suspended for the haymaker that shined Brad
Miller's ear.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment Stu Jackson's dart hit three, thus determining the
length in games of O'Neal's suspension, Laker Coach Phil Jackson
mused that it might be just as well, since O'Neal's aching toe needed
a rest anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Barely six games off the injured list, O'Neal was hurting again,
apparently, and more than one theorist suggested the constant pain
robbed O'Neal of his famous composure, leading to the attack on
Miller.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal returns as a full-time Laker today, when he is expected
back from his grandmother's funeral in time for practice.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to play Tuesday night at Staples Center against the
Denver Nuggets, and thus resume a fractured season.</TE>
<TE>   The question, then, is how long before O'Neal needs another day
off? Another week?</TE>
<TE>   Already, Jackson has held O'Neal out of all or parts of practices,
and still O'Neal gradually loses mobility and explosiveness.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has considered surgery that doctors believe would free the
first joint of his toe, but recovery takes three to four months, and
so far no one has suggested he attempt it until after the season, if
at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't got a feel for it yet," Jackson said. "We don't know
the extent of what it's going to be. We don't know if it's going to
be [aggravated] by overuse, which doesn't always have to be the same
case with arthritis. I've got at least four viable cures: an herbal
cure, a dietary cure, a liniment cure, and acupuncture still hasn't
been used. I mean, we've got a lot of ways to go yet.</TE>
<TE>   "And we still have a voodoo doctor, a 1-800 (doctor), on channel
TNT."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said recently that he has not sought a second opinion, that
he awakes every morning and does what he can, through the
anti-inflammatory medication-induced nausea.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Jackson is not sure what he has, or how long he
has it, and O'Neal hasn't answered questions from the media in more
than a week, so it is difficult to know what he is feeling today.</TE>
<TE>   "There's time,'' Jackson said. "There's time in the playoffs. You
have this constant marathon that you're going through in the regular
season."</TE>
<TE>   That changes in the playoffs, when television forces an airier
schedule, so O'Neal rarely, if ever, would have to play on
consecutive days after mid-April.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though O'Neal has snubbed the Los Angeles media, he told the New
York Times late last week that he pulled the punch that all but
missed Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "If I made contact," he said, "I don't even want to think what
would have happened."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the Miller incident would not be indicative of his
new court demeanor, though he has told teammates otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he warned Miller well before the punch, which Kobe
Bryant and Rick Fox overheard.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't carry things from game to game," O'Neal said. "It's over.
I'm moving on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The left wrist corrected by surgery last summer no longer bothers
Mark Madsen, who Saturday in San Antonio made a dunk and a jump hook,
both over Tim Duncan, and both left-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time last year when I'd go left and lose control of
the ball," he said. "Now, I don't have any problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   During O'Neal's suspension, Madsen averaged 27 minutes, 8.0 points
and 7.0 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   He made 12 of 22 field-goal attempts and, more important, made a
total pest of himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely confident," he said. "It's a matter of trying,
with Shaq out, to knuckling down and playing a little harder."</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Richmond, lost in Jackson's rotation for three months, is
starting to do some things. In nine January games--he had a DNP-CD on
Jan. 11 in Minnesota--Richmond has made 18 of 37 field-goal attempts,
including eight of 14 from the arc.... Brian Shaw, meantime, has four
DNP's in January.</TE>

<DH>NFC playoffs: Ram defense takes center stage in 45-17
victory, forcing Packers' Favre into a nightmare performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Ram defense made its way into the NFL record books
Sunday, even though most of America had already changed the channel.</LD>
<LD>   Six times the Rams wrapped their hands around Brett Favre
passes--tying a postseason interception record--on their way to a
45-17 throttling of the Green Bay Packers in an NFC division playoff
game.</LD>
<LD>   It was a national coming-out party for a defense that has quietly
thrived in the shadows cast by quarterback Kurt Warner and running
back Marshall Faulk.</LD>
<TE>   Warner and Faulk were bit players as the Rams generated a
season-low 292 yards of offense, their first sub-300-yard day in more
than a year. No matter, the league's third-ranked defense had the
game well in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Our offense is so good, we as a defense can go out, sneak in the
house and take all the goods," cornerback Aeneas Williams said. "And
they'll never know we're there."</TE>
<TE>   Strange analogy from a licensed minister, but, hey, cut Williams
some slack. He was feeling a bit giddy after returning two
interceptions for touchdowns--the Rams had three such scores on the
day--and getting mobbed in the end zone by teammates and well-wishers
almost falling out of the stands to slap him on the back.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 seasons with the Arizona Cardinals, Williams played in two
postseason games. Now, in his first season with the Rams, he's one
victory away from the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia, which plays here Sunday in the NFC championship
game, should offer more resistance. The Rams and Eagles needed
overtime to decide their season opener at Veterans Stadium, St. Louis
kicking a field goal to win, 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the Packers were patsies. They fell behind, 21-7,
early in the second quarter, even though Green Bay held a commanding
edge in yards, first downs and time of possession.</TE>
<TE>   None of that matters, of course, when your quarterback is playing
as if his eyes have been duct-taped shut.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the great quarterbacks, a hall of famer, the whole
thing," said Ram defensive end Chidi Ahanotu, who faced Favre for
years when Ahanotu played for Tampa Bay. "But Brett's just been
throwing it up. I don't know what it is, whether he's been getting
old, he doesn't want to get the hits, or he just doesn't care
anymore. You see him on film, he's doing check downs the whole game
and then he just throws it up in the air."</TE>
<TE>   So was Favre despondent? Sullen? Speechless? Nah.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's inconceivable to me," said Favre, who two weeks earlier
gave up the NFL single-season sack record to the New York Giants'
Michael Strahan. "I could have thrown eight, and we would have gotten
the ball back. But I'm going to keep chucking it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even remember the second one, nor the third one or the
fourth, fifth or sixth ones. They all seemed to run together. Six of
them are going to count as mine, I can assure you of that."</TE>
<TE>   That was fine by the Rams, whose defensive turnaround is one of
the season's more remarkable stories. They have eight new starters
and a first-year defensive coordinator, Lovie Smith, who brought the
scheme from Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams gave up 471 points last season, the seventh-highest total
in NFL history, and returned only two interceptions for touchdowns.
They almost doubled that Sunday, and would have if safety Kim Herring
had tacked on four more yards to his 45-yard return.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, St. Louis players were steamed all week about people
saying the Packer game would be a "shootout." Sure, the Ram offense
had a league-high 44 turnovers during the regular season, but
opponents scored only 10 touchdowns off those.</TE>
<TE>   "A shootout basically means they can just come in here and put 40
points on the board, if I'm not mistaken," Herring said. "Especially
nationally they were talking about 45-40. That's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   And Herring knows good defenses. He played for Baltimore last
season, when the Ravens rode their defense all the way to a Super
Bowl victory. As he sees it, these Rams aren't too far off that pace.
St. Louis might up the ante for other teams and cause owners around
the league to reason, "If the Rams can turn things around in a year,
we can too."</TE>
<TE>   "If they're smart, especially in a situation like Indianapolis
where they already have the offense in place, they should get someone
who runs this type of defense," linebacker London Fletcher said.
"It's proven to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly was Sunday. Green Bay did have 383 yards of offense,
but much of it was after the game was decided. In all, the Packers
had eight turnovers. Antonio Freeman, one of the few targets Favre
hit, caught touchdown passes of 22 and eight yards.</TE>
<TE>   Warner threw for 201 yards--his second-lowest total of the
season--with one interception. He didn't seem to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a luxury that you don't have to make big plays and force
plays in a situation like this," he said. "We felt we were going to
sit back and take what they gave us."</TE>
<TE>   And the Packers kept on giving.</TE>

<LD>Philadelphia (13-5) at St. Louis (15-2)</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, 1 p.m., Channel 11</LD>
<LD>   How they got there:  The Rams had a first-round bye as NFC West
Division champions and routed Green Bay, 45-17, in a divisional
playoff game. The Eagles defeated Tampa Bay, 31-9, in a wild-card
game and beat Chicago, 33-19, in a divisional playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   2001 meetings: On Sept. 9, the Rams defeated the Eagles, 20-17, in
overtime in Philadelphia. St. Louis leads the all-time series,
17-15-1.</TE>
<TE>   Common opponents: St. Louis 3-1, Philadelphia 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   About St. Louis: The Rams call their offense "The Greatest Show on
Earth." MVP quarterback Kurt Warner has an embarrassment of riches at
his disposal, with superstar Marshall Faulk as the unit's
centerpiece. Receivers Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce, Rick Proehl and
Az-Zahir Hakim make up the league's most dangerous group of wide
receivers. One of the worst defensive showings in NFL history was the
cause of the Rams' undoing in 2001, so the unit was revamped with
eight new starters, including all-pro cornerback Aeneas Williams. The
results were immediate, as the Rams finished third in total yards
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   About Philadelphia: The Eagles took another step toward
respectability this season, as they won their first NFC East title in
13 years. Donovan McNabb matured into one of the NFL's most dynamic
players, forcing defensive coordinators to spend hours finding a way
to slow him. Running back Duce Staley emerged as a receiving threat
as well as a tough runner and was backed up by talented rookie
Correll Buckhalter. Receiver James Thrash gave McNabb his first deep
threat and although tight end Chad Lewis didn't repeat his all-pro
season of 2000, he still proved to be a valuable target in the red
zone. The real heart and soul of the Eagles is in their hard-hitting
defense, led by tackling machines Hugh Douglas and Jeremiah Trotter.
The Eagles also field one the league's best secondaries, led by
all-pros Brian Dawkins and Troy Vincent.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Packer quarterback Brett Favre is now 12-18 in domes, and 13-33 on
artificial turf.</LD>
<LD>   But Ram guard Adam Timmerman, one of his former blockers in Green
Bay, said the decibels pumped out by the roaring St. Louis fans were
the big difference Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have to deal with the noise, and they did," he said. "I
don't think the turf is that big a deal. You probably look at their
turf record and say it is, but I think the biggest thing is they're
on the road. You just look at people's road record and it's always
worse than playing at home."</LD>
<TE>   For everyone, that is, except the Rams, who finished the regular
season 8-0 on the road and 6-2 at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The heat was on Kurt Warner--not from the Green Bay pass rush, but
the heating pads applied to his lower back every time he went to the
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Warner is coming off a brutal week. He could barely talk because
of bruised vocal cords--an injury that required him to wear a longer
face mask Sunday--and had a nasty bout with stomach flu. The backache
has been ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been having back spasms over the course of a couple weeks,"
he said. "With the things that have happened this week, the sickness
and stuff, I haven't been up on my fluids. I'm probably not
replenished. My back got a little stiff on me."</TE>
<TE>   His voice sounded fine, though, only slightly raspy.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' six interceptions were two fewer than the Minnesota
Vikings had all season.</TE>

<HD>Yzerman's 1,000th Assist Is a Winner for Detroit</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit's Steve Yzerman wasn't impressed with his milestone point.</LD>
<LD>   Yzerman collected his 1,000th assist on Mathieu Dandenault's
game-winning goal 59 seconds into overtime, which gave the Red Wings
a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Sunday night at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Yzerman became the ninth player in league history to notch 1,000
assists.</LD>
<TE>   "I look at it that I've played a long time on a good team with a
lot of good players and it's slowly added up," Yzerman said, "so I
don't really look at it as a real great achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Yzerman had the puck along the boards, sent it to Igor Larionov,
who threw it at the net, and Dandenault jammed the puck in from the
right side.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Red Wings--including Yzerman--had gone to the dressing
room, but the referees reviewed the play before calling it a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking, 'Don't do this to me,'" Dandenault said, "I don't
get that many."</TE>
<TE>   It was Dandenault's sixth goal this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anything about that goal because I had no idea where
that puck was," Ottawa goaltender Jani Hurme said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Havlat scored Ottawa's goals.</TE>
<TE>   He opened the scoring at 6:37 of the first period when he took the
puck around the net and shot it past Dominik Hasek.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit rookie Pavel Datsyuk tied the score at 11:25 of the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   Havlat put Ottawa ahead, 2-1, on a power play at 16:36 of the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Luc Robitaille tied the score, 2-2, at 2:03 of the third period
with his 612th career goal.</TE>
<TE>   Hurme, playing Detroit for the first time in his career, made 36
saves and Hasek had 20 to improve to 22-7-5 lifetime against Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Dallas 2--Steve Sullivan scored the game-winner early
in the third period and had an assist at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan whipped Michael Nylander's centering feed past Ed Belfour
at 1:19 of the third period, just moments after Belfour had stopped
Nylander on a close-in chance.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Calder and Tony Amonte scored for the Blackhawks, who
extended their unbeaten streak to four games (3-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nieuwendyk, playing his 1,000th game, and Brenden Morrow
scored for Dallas, which lost its second in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jocelyn Thibault stopped 24 shots to win his 100th game as a
Blackhawk.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Ed Belfour had 21 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Calder's power-play goal opened the scoring at 7:11 of the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   Calder redirected Alex Zhamnov's feed past Belfour despite being
knocked down by Richard Matvichuk.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow was credited with a power-play goal that tied the score,
1-1, with 1:40 left in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   His centering attempt to Mike Modano deflected off the skate of
Chicago defenseman Jaroslav Spacek and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Nieuwendyk gave the Stars a 2-1 lead at 4:36 of the second when he
deflected in Darryl Sydor's feed.</TE>
<TE>   Amonte tied the score, 2-2, at 10:22 of the second period.</TE>
<TE>   After Boris Mironov fired from a sharp angle, Amonte banged the
rebound through Belfour's pads and barely into the net.</TE>

<HD>Man in Replay Booth Shouldn't Pass Judgment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And so the two powerful forces move dangerously closer, their orbits
nearly touching, a calamitous collision impending.</LD>
<LD>   A botched instant replay call and the Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   A champion who shouldn't be a champion.</LD>
<TE>   A season decided by a machine.</TE>
<TE>   Is this the NFL or the BCS?</TE>
<TE>   They are starting to look the same, and if you don't think Feb. 3
could end up as tainted as Jan. 3, then think again.</TE>
<TE>   Things began growing ominous on Dec. 16 when a replay official may
have cost the Cleveland Browns a playoff spot, leading to a misguided
bottle-throwing rebellion of humans against technology.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a mere two weeks before the Super Bowl, things got
worse.</TE>
<TE>   A replay official pushed the Oakland Raiders out of the playoffs.
Pure and simple and scary.</TE>
<TE>   After defeating the New England Patriots in a divisional playoff
game in the snow, the Raiders were robbed of their victory by a
league employee who never felt a flake.</TE>
<TE>   A Tom Brady fumble became an Immaculate Incompletion.</TE>
<TE>   A team that should be in next week's AFC championship game and
that maybe was savvy enough to win it, is not.</TE>
<TE>   A shakily officiated season--remember how the replacements were
better than the regular officials?--has become downright tainted.</TE>
<TE>   And now, it officially makes sense to begin wondering.</TE>
<TE>   What happens if the same things happen in New Orleans?</TE>
<TE>   What if the St. Louis Rams score the winning touchdown in the
final minute against the Pittsburgh Steelers ... but after the
ensuing kickoff, the replay official stops the game and takes the
points off the scoreboard because he has decided that Marshall
Faulk's right toe was out of bounds?</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in Cleveland, a play overruled after another
play had been run.</TE>
<TE>   Or, what happens if Kurt Warner fumbles the ball while trying to
tuck it in on the Rams' final comeback drive, and Pittsburgh
recovers, and the Steelers essentially win the championship, and
nobody complains ... and then a replay official calls it a forward
pass?</TE>
<TE>   And the Rams get the ball again.</TE>
<TE>   And the Rams win.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what happened Saturday, on a call so horrendous
that average fans have found themselves uttering what was previously
the most demented sentence in the pro football parlance.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Al Davis is right.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so to suggest that the NFL has a conspiracy against the
Raiders is as silly as suggesting that Davis actually jogs in those
white silk jogging suits.</TE>
<TE>   But by leaving replay in the hands of the league in the last two
minutes of a game leaves the league open to plenty of questions.</TE>
<TE>   The first being, of course, dealing with Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   What were they thinking?</TE>
<TE>   When the Patriots' Tom Brady was hit by the Raiders' Charles
Woodson with 1:47 remaining and the Raiders leading, 13-10, he had
clearly ended any intention of passing and had tucked the ball toward
belly.</TE>
<TE>   Millions saw a football in Brady's right passing hand touching his
left hand, which must constitute a tuck. If even the wacky rules
don't make that clear, common sense should.</TE>
<TE>   So when the ball popped out, it was a fumble. And when Greg
Biekert fell on it for the Raiders, considering the Patriots were out
of timeouts, it was a victory and advancement into the AFC
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The officials called it. The celebrating Raiders knew it. The
dejected, uncomplaining Patriots knew it.</TE>
<TE>   If the rules allowed for coach's replay challenges in the final
two minutes, there would not probably have even been a Patriot
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   But this was not about Bill Belichick. This was about Rex Stuart.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Stuart?</TE>
<TE>   He's a replay official. Upstairs on television, he saw it as an
incompletion.</TE>
<TE>   He then summoned referee Walt Coleman, who felt who-knows-how-much
pressure to agree with his peer and change the decision and also see
it as an incompletion.</TE>
<TE>   "[Brady] would have had to have brought [the football] all the way
in and then it comes out," Coleman told reporters. "Then it would
have been a fumble."</TE>
<TE>   But, again, the ball was touching both hands at the time of the
hit. How much farther in must it get?</TE>
<TE>   A handful of plays later, the Patriots kicked a field goal to tie
the score, then they won it, 16-13, on their first possession of
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The snow, the comeback and the rip-off will combine to make it
probably the most memorable game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, it is the first incident in nearly 30 years that
reminds Raider fans of what has been voted the most memorable finish
in NFL history. That was the "Immaculate Reception," when the
Steelers defeated the Raiders in a 1972 playoff game after Franco
Harris ran for the winning touchdown after picking up a pass that had
ricocheted off either Steeler Frenchy Fuqua or Raider Jack Tatum.</TE>
<TE>   Replays were inconclusive, but many of those Steelers on the field
later admitted that the ball bounced only off Fuqua, making Harris'
reception illegal under league rules at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Fuqua has said he will go to his grave without acknowledging
exactly what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, when asked by reporters if he was throwing the
ball, Brady eerily sounded the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "If he hit me, I was going to throw it," he told reporters,
allegedly stifling a grin. "How do you like that?"</TE>
<TE>   And you wonder why the Raiders are paranoid?</TE>
<TE>   "People say that what goes on between Al Davis and the league
doesn't affect what happens on the field," Raider Tim Brown told
reporters. "But there's no way that you can tell me that that's so."</TE>
<TE>   Again, that's silly. But the changes that need to be made after
this season's two replay debacles are not.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just about the rules of incompletions and fumbles. It's
about the rules of replay.</TE>
<TE>   There should be no more challenges strictly from the booth. Even
in the last two minutes. Especially in the last two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Either the play is reviewed by request of one of the two coaches,
or not at all.</TE>
<TE>   Replay works when participants have control. It fails when they
don't.</TE>
<TE>   If that rule was in effect this season, the debacles in Cleveland
and New England would have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   And if coaches have used up all their requests by the end of the
game and they lose on a bad call? At least it is a human being with
mud on his shirt making that call, a frailty that worked just fine
for football's first several decades.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL is insulting its fans by permitting games to be decided by
guys in front of televisions.</TE>
<TE>   Just wait until that game is the Super Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Duo Helps Redondo Rebound</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those who wondered what happened to Redondo Union as the Sea
Hawks opened the season 6-5 on the heels of a Southern Section title,
here are two names: Wendell White and Eddie Topps.</LD>
<LD>   Both players were out for much of the early going as Redondo
struggled to live up to the hype that accompanied the return of five
of its top six players.</LD>
<LD>   White, a 6-foot-5 junior swingman, was lost in early December
after spraining an ankle in the Huntington Beach Ocean View
tournament, while Topps, a 5-10 senior guard, had been out since last
spring, when he suffered a broken foot.</LD>
<TE>   Without their standouts, the Sea Hawks went from No. 7 in The
Times' preseason rankings to an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   With those two, they have been unbeatable.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo has won seven consecutive games since White and Topps
returned in late December and now rests comfortably atop the Bay
League standings after beating preseason favorite Inglewood, 65-41,
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "With those two guys coming around, that's made a big difference,"
Redondo Coach Tom Maier said.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Sea Hawks (13-5, 7-0) played against Inglewood, maybe
they should go ahead and order the 2001-02 league championship
banner.</TE>
<TE>   After Inglewood's Ron Ligon opened the scoring with a
three-pointer, Redondo rattled off 32 of the next 34 points to take a
32-5 lead late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the Sentinels played without 6-10 center DeAngelo
Collins, who injured a knee in an upset loss to Mira Costa the week
before, and his presence in the middle was sorely missed as Redondo
outrebounded the Sentinels, 55-35. Paul Meynen led the Sea Hawks with
16 rebounds and White added 11 rebounds along with a game-high 23
points.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo followed the victory over Inglewood with a 76-62 win over
Santa Monica as star forward Adam Zahn scored 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Hawks, who last season won their first section title since
1943, could contend for a second section title in two years if they
stay physically sound.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vote of confidence: No one is doubting Simi Valley Royal Coach
Eddie Gutierrez now that his Highlanders have won nine games on the
heels of a 1-23 season.</TE>
<TE>   Royal's crowning achievement came recently when it defeated
Moorpark and Coach Tim Bednar, Gutierrez's former mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't too happy," said Gutierrez, who spent 11 seasons under
Bednar. "But he called the next day and congratulated me."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez, in his second year, inherited a Royal team devoid of
players with varsity experience, and it showed as the Highlanders
went 0-12 in the Marmonte League.</TE>
<TE>   This season, behind the play of senior forward Kyle Vondrak and
Simi Valley transfer Michael Nielsen, Royal is 9-10 overall and 3-3
in league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back to basketball: Lompoc guard Joel Smith is back to instilling
fear in defenses after scaring fans who witnessed his shoulder-first
tumble in a game Nov. 28 against Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Smith broke away on a steal and went up for a dunk when things
went terribly wrong. He failed to get a good grasp on the rim and his
momentum swung his feet out from under him, causing him to land on
the back of his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's knee inadvertently poked his eye on the landing, and he
fell unconscious and went into convulsions. "It was really a
horrifying situation," said Joe Smith, Joel's dad and the Lompoc
coach.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-5 senior guard was taken to a hospital, where he received
seven stitches on his head and underwent precautionary tests.</TE>
<TE>   Smith missed five games but has returned without any ill effects,
averaging 20 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Change of venues: For the first time since 1999, the Southern
California Regional finals will be held away from the Forum and the
Long Beach Pyramid. Finals in Divisions I-III will be held at Long
Beach Arena and finals in Divisions IV and V will be held at Long
Beach City College. The finals are March 16.</TE>
<TE>   Regional first-round and semifinal games will be March 6 and 9,
respectively. Teams that advance to the finals will play on one
week's rest, as opposed to one day's rest in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   That's because ARCO Arena, site of the state championships, is
tied up with an NCAA men's basketball tournament regional on March 14
and 16. State championships are scheduled for March 22-23.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you'll see a team play to its fullest potential [in the
regional final] because they'll have their legs," said Santa Ana
Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, whose team won the regional title last
season on one day's rest. "It also might make for a bigger buildup to
the game."</TE>

<HD>Moreno Valley Resumes Season as Coach Battles Cancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a brief break, Moreno Valley has resumed wrestling, but that
doesn't make the season any easier to cope with.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Raul Huerta unexpectedly resigned his position last week
because he needs to undergo treatment for colon cancer. The Vikings
didn't have an assistant coach qualified to take over, so they
temporarily put the season on hold.</LD>
<LD>   Phillip Peeples, a counselor at the school, stepped up to coach
and Moreno Valley continued its season Jan. 11 at the Riverside
County championships after missing one match.</LD>
<TE>   Huerta, who was in the hospital several days, is home resting,
Athletic Director Eric Lindner said. Lindner doesn't expect Huerta
will return next season, either.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a long road for Raul," Lindner said. "But he's a
tough guy and if anyone can get through this, it's him."</TE>
<TE>   Huerta, 27, was diagnosed with the disease last season and before
this season began he declared himself cancer-free. But the cancer
flared up again and sent him back to the hospital. He was voted
Riverside County coach of the year last week at the Riverside County
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, in addition to finding out Huerta had cancer, Moreno
Valley also had to cope with the death of assistant coach Mike
Matthews, who succumbed to pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing triple: Anyone wrestling against Garden Grove might want to
think twice, or three times, before turning his back between periods
of the lighter weight matches. The Argonauts might have a trick or
three up their sleeves.</TE>
<TE>   William, David and Eric Leyva are triplets wrestling on the
varsity team. William wrestles at 112 pounds while David and Eric
switch off at 103 pounds, often wrestling off against one another in
practice to see who gets the nod for the next match.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not as if the three seniors would need to pull a fast one
on opponents. The Leyvas are doing fine by themselves. William has
won two tournaments this year and has two other top-four finishes.
Eric has two firsts and a third and David also has a first.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had them on the team for three years and I still have a hard
time telling them apart," Garden Grove Coach Jose Orozco said. "I
just call them by their last name and then when one of them answers,
I'm like 'OK, which one are you?'"</TE>
<TE>   Orozco said that when the triplets started, they were scrawny
80-pounders, but he could see they had potential.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who has a brother likes to wrestle them," Orozco said.
"With these guys, they have built-in partners. They came here with
tons of wrestling experience even though they had never done it
competitively."</TE>
<TE>   They have developed, Orozco said, and all three rank among the top
six point-scorers on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably not talking state championship-quality wrestlers,
but they are pretty good," Orozco said.</TE>
<TE>   Streak ends: When Palmdale Highland lost to Littlerock last week,
it ended a 46-match Golden League winning streak for the Bulldogs.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs, in fact, had not lost a Golden League match since
the school opened in 1991. What made it hard for them to swallow was
the way they lost.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs held a 28-23 lead going into the final match, but
lost, 29-28, when their 103-pound wrestler was pinned. Highland
defeated Littlerock, 43-32, in a tournament earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing, but those things happen," Highland Coach Mike
Young said. "A few matches didn't go our way this time."</TE>

<HD>Sports Provide Reasons to Celebrate Holiday Too</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day set aside to honor the life and hopes and dreams of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., it might be a good time to celebrate the
progress that has been made in sports.</LD>
<LD>   All his life King stated in lyrical, eloquent words that the
United States and all humankind should progress to a place where race
doesn't matter. Be vigilant and persistent. Don't give in, don't give
up.</LD>
<LD>   And so, in all parts of life, people keep a scorecard. To bring
this country and humankind and even the sports world to a place where
race doesn't matter, we seem to need to count color. We tally the
times we fall short.</LD>
<TE>   Only four of 119 NCAA Division I college football coaches are
African American. Only one of 32 NFL head coaches is African
American. Those numbers are repeated so often it seems that on our
sporting fields, in our front offices and coaching booths we have
made no progress. To keep the hammer coming down on the shortcomings,
it seems prudent to ignore the improvements. Sometimes it seems as if
all things regarding race are getting worse and not better, that the
news is always bad.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Dungy is fired. Dennis Green is fired. The NFL is going
backward.</TE>
<TE>   And in pointing to the negative all the time, the conversation
becomes skewed. Perception is not reality. If we talk always of
failures, we are ignoring some of the things Martin Luther King stood
for. King, after all, said the goal is to count character and not
skin color.</TE>
<TE>   If all that is taken from Tampa Bay's firing of Dungy is that an
African American coach lost his job, then the point has been missed.</TE>
<TE>   The men who look bad are the owners of the Buccaneers, the
Glazers, who clumsily fired the talented, admired, classy Dungy in a
greedy clutch for an egotistical has-been. And the has-been looks
even worse now.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Parcells has been uncovered as selfish and self-centered, and
the Glazers have been left without a coach. Dungy is choosing between
offers to coach the Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers. Those
are two places where white coaches were fired.</TE>
<TE>   It is natural, when change is needed, to pinpoint only the bad
things that have created the need for change. It is embarrassing,
when we speak of race, to point out things that should always have
been.</TE>
<TE>   But in just the last year there have been good things.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on a Sunday afternoon last March, when Kentucky faced
Mississippi in the Southeastern Conference championship men's
basketball game, both coaches and all three officials were African
Americans. And what was great about this is that almost nobody seemed
to notice. No one felt the need to point and say, "My, aren't we
great?"</TE>
<TE>   Tubby Smith at Kentucky and Rod Barnes at Mississippi were hired
for those head coaching jobs in cities where four decades ago they
wouldn't have been allowed to play basketball.</TE>
<TE>   When Smith replaced Rick Pitino as Kentucky coach four-plus years
ago, a Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader columnist wrote that Smith was
making a mistake in taking the job because the racists in Lexington
would run him out of town, would never give him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Smith hasn't been run out of town. He has won a national
championship and been worshiped. He has played his son at point guard
and been ripped on talk radio. When the Wildcats win, Smith is God.
When the Wildcats lose, Smith is a bum. In other words, his treatment
is no different from that received by any basketball coach at
Kentucky. And that's the point. When Pitino returned to the town last
month as coach of in-state rival Louisville, it was Pitino, once God
himself in Lexington, who was booed.</TE>
<TE>   And isn't that what King was aiming for? "Tubby, Tubby, Tubby,"
they shouted at Rupp Arena. In an arena named after a legend who
tarnished himself by refusing to recruit African Americans for far
too long, an African American was embraced as one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   As long as racism was institutionalized in our country, in our
sports, it couldn't just disappear.</TE>
<TE>   For those who say that it is unfair that there are so few African
American coaches and general managers while retread white men are
recycled, that the good, old boys' club keeps propping up losers,
guess what?</TE>
<TE>   African American men are now in the recyclable pipeline too.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy is going to be recycled immediately. Green, who is going to
spend a year doing television, will be in demand when he decides to
coach again. Count on it.</TE>
<TE>   There are seven NFL assistant coaches being touted as head
coaching prospects. Four of them--Ted Cottrell of the New York Jets,
Lovie Smith of the St. Louis Rams, Greg Blache of the Chicago Bears
and Marvin Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens--are African American.</TE>
<TE>   And it isn't only in football where African Americans have filled
the pipeline and moved to the head of the interview pool.</TE>
<TE>   When Pat Riley suddenly bolted the New York Knicks, it was the man
sitting next to him on the bench who got the job: Jeff Van Gundy.
This year, when Van Gundy suddenly bolted the Knicks, it was the man
sitting next to him on the bench who got the job: Don Chaney. An
African American. It was the natural progression. Chaney got the job
the same way dozens of white men did. By moving up the chain.</TE>
<TE>   It happened that way in Charlotte too. Dave Cowens got fired, Paul
Silas was next in line. Maybe Silas waited longer in line than some
thought he should have, but the wait is getting shorter. John
Lucas--ex-Philadelphia coach, ex-San Antonio coach--is now Cleveland
coach. Recycled, same as Don Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   When Notre Dame hired Tyrone Willingham as coach last month, Notre
Dame needed Willingham far more than Willingham needed the Notre Dame
job. And Notre Dame didn't need Willingham for his race.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame needed Willingham because Willingham knows how to
recruit talented football players with the highest academic and moral
standards. He has done that at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there aren't enough minorities yet in major league
baseball front offices or on the sidelines of big-time college
football programs. But if a survey was done, those four head coaches
out of 119 teams probably constitute a higher percentage of African
American leadership in the football programs than you'd find in the
chemistry, engineering, law or history departments at those
universities. Sports does better.</TE>
<TE>   And it will keep getting better. Why? Because sports is about
competition. And you can't compete by keeping out talent of any color
or any sex.</TE>
<TE>   If all we do is browbeat owners or athletic directors or
university presidents with the negative racial statistics, we demean
so many others. Talented men and women of all races don't need to beg
for jobs. They need only stand tall and say, "Pass me by at your own
peril. I can win for you or for somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday night, Martin Luther King's birthday, the NHL
celebrated Diversity Day. There was a special ceremony before the
Edmonton-St. Louis game. It included a photo of players representing
cultures throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The message Dr. King gave was not strictly one for people of
color," Frank Brown, NHL spokesman, said. "It was of embracing all
cultures."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is better for the Latino and Japanese and Korean players
who have arrived to strengthen the game. Hockey is better for the
Finns and Swedes, Russians and Czechs. The Olympics keep getting
better with the increasing prominence of women's sports.</TE>
<TE>   King would approve.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Oakland Raider executive Bruce Allen can't watch his videotape of
Saturday's overtime loss to New England.</LD>
<LD>   "I smashed mine," he said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after a controversial call in a driving snowstorm cost them
a berth in the AFC championship game, the Raiders were still fuming
with frustration. They are convinced Patriot quarterback Tom Brady
fumbled with 1:47 to play in regulation when he was hit by cornerback
Charles Woodson. Linebacker Greg Biekert recovered the loose ball.</LD>
<TE>   But referee Walt Coleman reversed his own call after watching the
replay, ruling Brady never tucked the ball away and therefore was
still in the act of throwing. It was ruled an incomplete pass. Four
plays later, Adam Vinatieri kicked a 45-yard field goal to forge a
13-13 tie. He clinched the victory with a 23-yard field goal on the
opening drive in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Pereira, the NFL's director of officiating who was in St.
Louis on Sunday to observe the Ram-Packer game, said Coleman's call
was correct, but he indicated he would bring up the rule with the
competition committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear to me; the call was 100% right," Pereira said. "Does
that mean we won't take a look at the rule in the off-season? It's
high-profile enough as to what happened that I think we'll take a
look at it. But we look at a lot of things."</TE>
<TE>   Pereira, who watched the game on TV in St. Louis, said he read and
reread page 12 of the rule book just to make sure. He said he
expected the call to be reversed, even as he watched it live.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the arm starts forward, it's considered a pass all the way
through tucking it back into your body. If the ball comes out at any
time, whether it drops out of your hand, whether it hits your own
hand, whether it hits an opponent's hand, it's an incomplete pass.
[It's incomplete] until you get it tucked against your side, or if
you bring it up and re-cock it to throw it again."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders, meanwhile, are seething. Allen said he left several
messages with the league and, as of noon Sunday, had yet to get a
return call.</TE>
<TE>   "We've looked at it from every angle," he said. "Everyone who's
seen it is shocked.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very similar to if they ruled [Vinatieri's] field
goal no good, if it was good. It doesn't have anything to do with
some unknown rule. It's just a fumble."</TE>

<HD>Hejduk Thankful for Second Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever former UCLA defender Frankie Hejduk's name has come up
during the past year, it invariably has had the phrase "languishing
on the bench at Bayer Leverkusen" attached to it.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, after being a starter in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the
France '98 World Cup and the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Hejduk virtually
vanished from the radar as far as the U.S. national soccer team was
concerned.</LD>
<LD>   He was earning a good salary in the German Bundesliga, but he
wasn't a starter there and thus became almost a forgotten man on this
side of the Atlantic.</LD>
<TE>   Hejduk, 27, didn't play a single minute for the U.S. in 2001, but
Coach Bruce Arena has called him back into the team for the CONCACAF
Gold Cup now under way in Miami and Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   That's because Arena was not totally satisfied that either Steve
Cherundolo or Tony Sanneh was the correct player to fill the right
back position at the Japan/Korea World Cup this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankie has a lot of international experience," Arena explained.
"Obviously, the last couple of years at Leverkusen have not been the
best for him in terms of the amount of playing time he's received,
but at the same time we know Frankie is a player with some unique
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   "He can play the right side of the field in a position where we
still aren't fully convinced we have the right players and are not
getting the kind of play we need out of the right back position."</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk played all 90 minutes in Saturday's 2-1 victory over South
Korea at the Rose Bowl and will start again in today's 3 p.m. game
against Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just good to be back on the team, and I thank Bruce for
giving me another shot at being able to come back," Hejduk said. "I
know it's a difficult decision for him being as I'm not starting
regularly at Leverkusen, but I still do get games, I still do get 90
minutes every weekend with the reserve team."</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk was satisfied with his 31st appearance for the national
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was all right," he said. "I haven't been in the
national team for a little while, so of course you get some
butterflies and nerves and you always want to do more to make an
impression than sometimes you're able to do.</TE>
<TE>   "But I tried to play simple. I tried to do the things that Bruce
told me to do before the game.... The more games you play the better
you get and the more confidence you get. So today I think was all
right and we came out with a victory which was good too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Gold Cup games Sunday at Miami, Costa Rica advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 1-1 tie against Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti
kept its hopes alive with a 2-0 victory against Ecuador.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Gets Albright Idea</HD>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The new year is only three weeks old and already Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid has taken his first big gamble of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Schmid passed up the opportunity to acquire one of Major League
Soccer's leading players, Honduran midfielder Alex Pineda Chacon, who
last season was not only the league's most valuable player but also
its top goal scorer.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Schmid traded away two first-round draft picks to get
Washington D.C. United forward Chris Albright, whose three-season,
56-game MLS career so far has produced only four goals. By
comparison, Chacon scored 19 in 2001, his debut season in MLS.</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, Schmid's move appears foolish in the extreme, but
there was more behind the decision. First, if the Galaxy had picked
up Chacon in the dispersal of players from the now-defunct Miami
Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny, it would have had to get rid of
long-serving playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos, one of only three
remaining original Galaxy players.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon, 32, plays the same position as Cienfuegos, who turns 34
next month, and his acquisition would have pushed the Galaxy over the
salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid felt it was more important to retain the Salvadoran
midfielder, who has been a fan favorite for six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think it's important for this franchise to give Mauricio
the opportunity to finish his career in L.A.," he said. "I think he's
given a lot to this city and I really want his career, as it moves
toward its finish, to finish in a way that he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Caligiuri's last year [in 2001] went very well and it was a
deserving and a fitting finish for a guy who had a great career. I
would really like to see Mauricio's career end that way too. We have
a great deal of respect for our Salvadoran fans and [trading or
waiving Cienfuegos to acquire Chacon] would have been a sign of
disrespect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instead of pursuing Chacon, the Galaxy acquired one of his Fusion
teammates, Jamaican national team midfielder/defender Tyrone
Marshall, 27, who probably will take Caligiuri's place as the
starting left back although he played at right back for Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we went for Tyrone is because he is a
two-footed player," Schmid said. "He's comfortable at left back, he's
comfortable at right back and he can also play in the middle. He's
also got great speed, and if there was a knock on our defense [last
season] it was that we didn't have [enough speed on defense]. He
helps resolve that problem."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, a first-round draft pick out of Florida International
University in 1998 before moving from the Colorado Rapids to Miami
the next season, said he expected to find a new team after the Fusion
folded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good feeling to know that someone's out there tracking
what you've done in the past," he said. "It's just a good feeling
being wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid passed up other opportunities to sign new players in the
MLS allocation and dispersal process, but afterward engineered the
trade that brought Albright to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There is history behind this move too. When Albright, 23, first
came into the league out of the University of Virginia in 1999,
Schmid was furious. He believed the Galaxy, not D.C. United, should
have had first rights to him.</TE>
<TE>   Albright had been the leading scorer for the U.S. under-20
national team, which Schmid coached to the second round of the FIFA
World Youth Championship in Nigeria in 1999. He also was an integral
part of the U.S. team that finished fourth at the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games.</TE>
<TE>   But in MLS he has struggled to make an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to forget what happened [at D.C. United] and try to move
on," Albright said, calling his move to Los Angeles "a fresh start."
Albright, from Philadelphia, said that at 19 he was not prepared to
handle the level of play in MLS and that his inability to score goals
for Washington had nothing to do with the way he was used by former
D.C. United coach Thomas Rongen, who last week was named coach of the
U.S. under-20 team.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time I don't think I was ready to produce like people
wanted me to produce," Albright said. "To be quite honest, I don't
think I was there yet, as far as technically, tactically and
everything else. I'm still young, I'm just starting to figure out the
game and MLS and the differences and the little nuances that you need
to know in order to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was just a growing process and this being a fresh
start will only help."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And what happened to Chacon?</TE>
<TE>   He was picked up by the New England Revolution, whose coach,
former U.S. national team defender Fernando Clavijo, has strengthened
his team immeasurably by adding Chacon; Senegalese forward Mamadou
"Big Mama" Diallo, the league's top scorer in 2000; U.S. national
team defender Carlos Llamosa; U.S. 2000 Olympic team goalkeeper Adin
Brown, and American midfielders Steve Ralston, Jim Rooney and Shaker
Asad.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Galaxy still is seeking a forward to replace Luis
Hernandez. Guatemalan striker Carlos Ruiz is the current target.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in its six-year history, the Galaxy probably
won't have any Mexican players in its lineup. The theory is that
since Mexican-American fans didn't turn out in great numbers when the
team had Hernandez, Jorge Campos or Carlos Hermosillo, not having
such name players will make little difference.</TE>
<TE>   Like Albright, it's another gamble the Galaxy is taking.</TE>

<HD>First Week Was a Tale of the Tape</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Aces in this tournament don't refer to serves or the likes of Jiri
Novak or Stefan Koubek.</LD>
<LD>   Aces around here are bandages.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian Open has long been sponsored by car makers.</LD>
<TE>   Next year, how about another mode of transportation as sponsor ...
crutches, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   A dark mood was cast hours before the first serve was struck at
Melbourne Park on opening day when two-time defending champion Andre
Agassi withdrew because of an injured right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament's first week of the wounded and weary limped to an
end Sunday when Spanish teenager Anabel Medina Garrigues suffered a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee in the first set
against Monica Seles. She will require surgery and could be out more
than four months.</TE>
<TE>   In between the Agassi withdrawal and the frightening spill of
Medina Garrigues was this long list of player casualties: Former
champion Mary Pierce of France, American teenager Andy Roddick, Lina
Krasnoroutskaya of Russia, Nicolas Massu of Chile, Agustin Calleri of
Argentina and Alexandre Simoni of Brazil. These six retired from
matches because of injury.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the injuries were attributable to the dreaded, often
sticky Rebound Ace surface. But the most noteworthy
injuries--Roddick's crash and burn and Medina Garrigues' tumble--were
related to the controversial surface.</TE>
<TE>   Not included in the list above are two former Grand Slam
champions. Serena Williams, the 1999 U.S. Open champion, would have
been seeded fifth but withdrew after injuring her ankle in a tuneup
tournament in Sydney. Lindsay Davenport, who won the Australian Open
two years ago, did not even make the trip because of knee surgery
just before the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the survivors. Venus Williams had tendinitis in her
left knee mysteriously appear and just as mysteriously disappear.
Jennifer Capriati, the defending champion, has been hobbled by sore
hip flexors. Kim Clijsters of Belgium carried on into the final 16
despite a sore right arm. Her boyfriend, top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia, wasn't nearly as fortunate; weakened by a recent case of
chickenpox, he lost in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone--even those who report on tennis--seemed to be injured or
ill, victimized by some strange Australian Open jinx. Is this some
sort of cosmic payback for a successful Olympics in Sydney in 2000?</TE>
<TE>   The star quality has been so diluted on the men's side that
eighth-seeded Pete Sampras was to play his second consecutive night
match later today in the fourth round against Marat Safin of Russia.
Tommy Haas of Germany, at No. 7, was the highest seeded man left in
the event.</TE>
<TE>   Gone by the end of the first two rounds were Hewitt, Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil, Agassi, Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia and Sebastien
Grosjean of France, the top five seeded players--a first at a Grand
Slam in the Open era of tennis.</TE>
<TE>   From an American perspective, the first week featured the worst
showing by men since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras was the only one to reach the final 16, and only three
Americans got to the third round. Wild-card entrant Taylor Dent lost
in five sets to Adrian Voinea of Romania, and veteran Todd Martin
went out in five sets against Haas.</TE>
<TE>   On the women's side, the outlook is much stronger. Williams and
Seles were to play each other in the quarterfinals, and Capriati
joined them today, defeating Rita Grande of Italy, 6-3, 7-6 (9), in
the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   Novak, Koubek,  Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas Johansson aren't exactly
household names in the U.S., but they don't have locals desperately
trying to dump second-week tickets. Attendance was down only slightly
from last year, by 11,500--2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the press room has not been quite as fervent--one
British journalist tried to catch the next plane out of town after
Tim Henman departed in typically underwhelming fashion in the third
round. TV sets in one media row were fixed on cricket, Manchester
United soccer, opera and Prince Harry's travails over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if there were to be a Slam with few (male) stars, it might
as well happen in Australia. Names are nice but not a necessary
accessory.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they could have the tournament without the players," said
Sydney Morning Herald columnist Richard Hinds. "They are interested
in the tournament as an event.</TE>
<TE>   "Jiri Novak could play Pete Sampras' racket stringer and they'd
still show up."</TE>

<HD>Wake-Up Call at Tucson Is a Reminder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aftershocks from the UCLA fissure that Arizona exposed at Tucson
could cause a serious shakeup or be too mild to notice. It's tough to
predict with this team.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond dispute is that allowing a 20-point lead to vanish in fewer
than four minutes and the resulting 96-86 defeat prove the Bruin
foundation is not solid. Even a victory over Stanford at home
Thursday would not change that, just as last week's victory over
then-No. 1 Kansas was not a cure-all.</LD>
<LD>   Several problems are glaring:</LD>
<TE>   * Center Dan Gadzuric's frequent foul trouble. The 6-foot-11
senior has fouled out of three games in a row, limiting his minutes
to an average of 19. Equally troubling is his apparent lack of
willingness to alter his game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to play hard," he said. "If I get in foul trouble, so
be it. My teammates are getting beat, so I have to be there to
protect the basket. I'm not going to be a post player who is soft."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is compounded by poor defense and rebounding by backup
T.J. Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   * The lack of an experienced point guard. Freshmen Cedric Bozeman
and Ryan Walcott are improving, but are not close to being ready for
the rigors of the NCAA tournament. Not only were they no match for
Wildcat veteran Jason Gardner, they lacked the poise and polish of
Arizona freshmen Salim Stoudamire and Wil Bynum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's coming, but it's taking time," Bozeman said. "I learn
something every time I'm out there."</TE>
<TE>   * The snail-like progress of freshmen Dijon Thompson and Andre
Patterson. Both have great potential, but Errick Craven of USC and
Arizona's trio of Stoudamire, Bynum and center Channing Frye (19
points against UCLA) are freshmen much further along.</TE>
<TE>   For every breathtaking play made by the athletic Thompson, there
is a youthful blunder. Patterson rebounds well and is a shot-blocker,
but he isn't playing enough to improve rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   * Coach Steve Lavin's glacier-pace adjustments during games. The
UCLA coach devised effective game plans for top opponents--Alabama,
Kansas and Arizona being the prominent examples--but he must react
more quickly and imaginatively during the battle.</TE>
<TE>   After UCLA scored at will from the perimeter in the first half,
the Wildcats went to a three-guard lineup and extended their pressure
defense to midcourt. The Bruins ceased getting open shots, and
Lavin's only response was pulling Bozeman in favor of Walcott.</TE>
<TE>   The result was 12 second-half turnovers and 33% shooting by UCLA
and a barrage of easy transition baskets by Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "They were shaky ballhandlers," Bynum said. "So we felt if we
turned up the pressure and got the crowd into it, we'd be able to
come back. It seemed like we adjusted and they didn't. And once their
big guy fouled out, we scored inside and out."</TE>
<TE>   A succinct summary of the game--and of UCLA's problems, which
apparently even a freshman can recognize.</TE>

<HD>He Finally Got a Shot</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He's USC's equivalent of the fifth Beatle, or the fourth Ghostbuster.</LD>
<LD>   Gennaro Busterna is the Trojans' forgotten fourth senior.</LD>
<LD>   Busterna hadn't really done anything memorable in his two-year USC
career ... until Thursday during the Trojans' meltdown at Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   Busterna made a basket. Then another. And he sprinkled in some
free throws for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his senior year, the junior college transfer from
Nebraska's McCook College had finally scored ... big. After failing
to register a point in 15 previous career appearances, Busterna was
the Trojans' third-leading scorer with 10 points in the 97-80 loss to
the Wildcats.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was going to be the first Division I player to go
through his career and not score a basket so I was happy to see him
make a couple," USC Coach Henry Bibby said with a smile. "He might be
a guy that I start using a little bit. I've always thought Gennaro
was one of our best shooters."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' three senior starters--David Bluthenthal, Sam Clancy
and Brandon Granville--were happy to see their classmate bust open
his personal goose egg by making two of five shots, all three-point
attempts, and four of five free throws in six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to see him light it up like that," Clancy said. "He's
one of the best players on the team."</TE>
<TE>   Busterna, though, said that finally scoring was bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts to lose when I finally get a chance to play," said
Busterna, now averaging 1.1 points and 2.1 minutes in nine
appearances this season. "It felt great to make my first shot. Then I
felt like every shot was going in."</TE>
<TE>   He played three minutes and missed his only shot in USC's 81-73
win at Arizona State on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Azusa Marks King's Message With Call Against Hate Crimes</HD>
<DH>Unity: Recent firebombings have spurred residents to gather for the
holiday and decry racial hatred.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The firebombs thrown at three Azusa houses--homes to African
American families with children--sparked more than flames. The acts have
ignited the foothill city's passion to rid itself of the roots of racism.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 people from across the ethnic rainbow gathered outside
City Hall for "Hands Across Azusa" Sunday afternoon, the city's first
Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration.</LD>
<LD>   As Kimasi Browne, director of Azusa Pacific University's gospel choir,
led the crowd in verses of "We Shall Overcome," residents joined hands to
form a giant circle of unity. In speeches, participants pledged to honor
King's memory by rejecting the kind of racial hatred that has struck
close to home.</LD>
<TE>   The gathering comes after Molotov cocktails crashed through the
windows of two homes and were tossed at another. None of the residents
were injured during the late-night attacks on Dec. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that Latino gang members are responsible for the
crimes, the possible result of racial fights in state prisons that have
spilled into the community and have targeted innocent African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a $25,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in
the attacks and FBI involvement in the probe, no arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   But Azusa officials continue to confront hate crime issues head-on.
While some municipalities try to play down hate crimes, Azusa has
aggressively reported suspected acts of hatred for years to state and
federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   They have recently formed a city human relations commission and widely
promoted Sunday's event.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Logan Westbrooks led the crowd in a community pledge to
"interrupt prejudice," speak out against bias and reach out to those
targeted for harassment.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that one person can make a difference and that no person
can be an innocent bystander when it comes to opposing hate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This response to hate is something Dr. King would have been proud to
be part of," said Westbrooks, an African American minister who grew up in
Memphis during the fight for desegregation.</TE>
<TE>   Westbrooks, pastor of Faith Temple Church of God In Christ, is one of
nine members of the newly selected Azusa Human Relations Commission.
Their goal is to come up with ways to curtail hate and prejudice in this
city of nearly 45,000.</TE>
<TE>   The task, Westbrooks said, begins with breaking the cycle of hate from
generation to generation.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans are less than 4% of the population, while Latinos
account for nearly two-thirds. In the last few years, the city--located
20 miles northeast of Los Angeles--has gone from being labeled "the
caboose of the San Gabriel Valley" to an attractive site for new homes
and retailers.</TE>
<TE>   But Azusa's comparatively high numbers of hate crimes for a city its
size has attracted headlines and dubious publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa police reported nine hate crimes in 2001, including the three
attempted firebombings. And 13 were reported in 2000, including three
other firebombings.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say much of that is due to the Police Department's policy
that pays special attention to considering when a crime is motivated by
racial hatred.</TE>
<TE>   "Some cities such as Azusa are far more vigilant when it comes to
reporting hate crimes, while others prefer to downplay the hate aspect of
a crime," said Robin Toma, executive director of the Los Angeles County
Commission on Human Relations, which tracks hate crimes across the
county.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa City Manager Rick Cole said there can be no downplaying the
magnitude of terror experienced by the three families attacked last
December.</TE>
<TE>   He called them "a random choice for acts of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, a burning bottle crashed through Sandra Sanni's
bedroom window, causing her to bolt up from bed and see sparks fly past
her dresser.</TE>
<TE>   The bottle landed at the entrance to her 6-year-old boy's bedroom door
and burst into flames. She screamed at her son and 9-year-old daughter to
stay away as she smothered the flames with a pillow.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes earlier, the same kind of firebomb crashed through the living
room window of Dion Smith and his family. Smith, 31, snuffed out the
smoldering bottle before it ignited his carpet.</TE>
<TE>   "We can bind together to fight this hate that has struck our city,"
George Younan, an Azusa Pacific University student, told the crowd. "We
can come together to accomplish the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King."</TE>
<TE>   Younan's father, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was shot and killed
Oct. 17 in Sylmar in an incident his family believes was motivated by
prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Agundez, 16, an Azusa High School junior, said that thanks to
King's legacy he is able to make friends across the ethnic spectrum.
"We've got to relate to one another, no matter what our color," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Diane Chagnon warned the crowd that the community cannot
afford to be complacent.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we see the power of a community united," she said. "The real
test is when we leave. We need to stay united."</TE>

<HD>Detention of Al Qaeda Suspects Challenged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles agreed Sunday night to consider a
petition from civil rights advocates demanding that the U.S. government
bring terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Naval Base before a court and
define the charges against them.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Judge A. Howard Matz scheduled a hearing for
Tuesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual petition, filed in a venue far removed from the Cuban
base, is the first court challenge to the Bush administration's detention
of Al Qaeda suspects, and constitutional experts said it would raise
unique legal issues.</LD>
<TE>   Chief among the quandaries is whether a U.S. district court, which
ordinarily is restricted to a geographical area, has jurisdiction over
prisoners held on Cuban territory leased to the U.S. government. Also,
the judge will determine whether the petitioners--all from Los
Angeles--have the legal standing to pursue such a case.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the court could be forced to weigh whether detainees were
acting on behalf of a government or a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   "On the surface, it certainly looks meritorious," said Karl Manheim, a
constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School, who read the petition
Sunday. "This is really designed to test the validity of military trials
and, to a lesser extent, the validity of their removal from Afghanistan,
and third, to challenge the conditions of their detention."</TE>
<TE>   The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was delivered Saturday
evening to a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles. It was prepared on
behalf of approximately 110 Al Qaeda suspects taken into custody in
Afghanistan and transferred to the U.S. Navy base in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The petition alleges that the detainees are being held in violation of
the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Convention. It requests that U.S.
authorities produce the prisoners in a U.S. court, explain the reasons
for their detention, and accord them due-process guarantees. It also
seeks to block any transfer of the detainees from the U.S. base in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Stephen Yagman, best known for high-publicity cases involving
police abuse, filed the petition for a coalition of clergy, journalism
professors and civil-rights attorneys, among them former Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark and USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   "These individuals were brought out of their country in shackles,
drugged, gagged and blindfolded, and are being held in open-air cages in
Cuba," Chemerinsky said. "Someone should be asserting their rights under
international law."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has argued that at least some of the detainees
were operatives of the Al Qaeda international terrorist network, and not
a legally constituted foreign government.</TE>
<TE>   This distinction is key to determining the extent of their protection
by the U.S. Constitution and international law.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has said that the detainees are being
held for interrogation, and that some could be tried in a military
tribunal, while others could be held accountable in criminal courts. The
U.S. government also contends they are not prisoners of war, a precept
that has not been directly challenged by international authorities.</TE>
<TE>   International Red Cross officials have begun questioning detainees
about their treatment, and last week U.N. human-rights chief Mary
Robinson urged the U.S. to abide by international law and not "fudge or
blur the edges."</TE>
<TE>   Yagman said he filed the petition in Los Angeles "because I'm here.
That's where the lawyer is." He said any district court should have
jurisdiction over the case. "The important thing is this will force them
to say something," Yagman said of the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   An additional habeas corpus petition is expected from an Australian
attorney, who said last week that he would file on behalf of a countryman
being held among the Al Qaeda suspects.</TE>

<HD>Class Size Reform Eroding</HD>
<DH>Education: Some districts abandon the 20-student limit because of
money shortages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since a popular state reform reduced class sizes
in most primary grades, a few school districts are opting out of the
program, citing their worsening financial picture.</LD>
<LD>   One school system in Riverside County already is packing more second-
and third-graders into every room. Irvine, one of the state's
highest-scoring school districts, could follow suit Tuesday. Other
districts, including Capistrano in south Orange County and Vista in San
Diego, are tossing around similar proposals as they seek to balance their
budgets.</LD>
<LD>   And several more districts notified a state education group that they
are considering raising the number of students in primary classes.</LD>
<TE>   Until this year, virtually all of the state's 900 eligible school
districts participated in the voluntary program, which caps class sizes
at 20--down from more than 30--in first through third grade, and some
kindergartens. Parents and teachers have raved about the smaller classes
since they started six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The most significant educational reform initiative our country has
seen is dying on the vine," said Jim Fleming, superintendent of the
45,000-student Capistrano Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming said his district may be forced to raise class sizes in third
grade next year. If state officials don't do something, he predicted,
"class size reduction will be a memory" within the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Though the state picks up much of the program's cost, districts must
shoulder more of the burden as new teachers advance up the pay scale
faster than state funding increases. And with a faltering state budget
that gives less discretionary funding to districts, many said they can no
longer afford to cover the difference.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, some officials said they would rather add 12 students to
some primary classes than slash arts, science and music for elementary
schools, and raise class sizes for grades four through 12.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to understand the pain we are going through," said Steven
Choi, president of the Irvine school board.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents in the 24,000-student district agreed. At a meeting last
week to discuss proposed cuts, scores of parents pleaded to keep
specialized music and science teachers at the elementary schools. Few
even mentioned larger classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Class size is no big deal," said Lata Kumar, mother of a
first-grader, who said she attended schools in India with 40 or more
students and did just fine. "It's a big hype. . . . But science--how can
you study without science?"</TE>
<TE>'All the Teachers Are Devastated'</TE>
<TE>   Still, the smaller class sizes for the state's youngest students have
proved immensely popular among parents and teachers. They said young
children need one-on-one time with teachers as they learn basic skills in
reading and math that will carry them through their academic careers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go back to the way it was, more kids are going to fall through
the cracks," said Kathleen Carney, who teaches second grade at Deerfield
Elementary in Irvine. "I can get to every single kid in my classroom,
every day, on every assignment. You cannot do that with higher numbers. .
. . All the teachers are devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it is too soon to say whether budget woes could
eventually force a significant number of school districts to eliminate
the smaller classes. But some experts said there are worrisome signs.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Piccoli, who is in charge of the program for the state Department
of Education, said she has been getting so many phone calls from school
administrators saying they are afraid they no longer can afford the
program that she has changed her voice-mail message to urge them to be
patient in awaiting her return call.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in a real tough situation right now," she said. "This is not
normal."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the California Assn. of School Business Officials e-mailed
all its members asking whether they thought the program was in jeopardy.
Within 48 hours, 10 administrators from the 900 districts in the program
had replied that they were considering abandoning part or all of it next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the group, said more districts may
have to increase class sizes in kindergarten or third grade next year,
but are hesitant to say so publicly yet because of the outcry from
parents and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the program's popularity, educators said they would rather
cut almost anything else. Saddleback Unified in south Orange County, for
example, slashed $8.5 million from its budget this year, cutting music,
science, library clerks and custodians. But it managed to hold onto
smaller primary classes.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, other districts face similarly wrenching decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In Riverside's Val Verde Unified, officials two years ago discontinued
the smaller classes for the few third-grade classrooms that had it. This
year, second grade went to 30-plus students per class. Next year, first
grade could go the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to do it," said Mike Boyd, who heads up business
services for the fast-growing school system. "It's not the right thing to
do, but it's the right thing to do to keep us fiscally solvent."</TE>
<TE>   The district simply lacks the space to house all the students.
Enrollment has doubled in the past nine years to 12,000 students. The
cost of building new classrooms and a heavy debt load leaves little money
for anything else, Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Cabrillo Unified School District in Northern California
will ask voters to approve a parcel tax. If it fails, kindergarten could
go to 30-plus students next year, officials there said.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are the losers in this whole situation," said John Bayless,
superintendent of the 4,000-student school system.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators in Vista and the Live Oak district in Santa Cruz
said they also may have to drop part of the program.</TE>
<TE>New Students Keep Showing Up</TE>
<TE>   The way the state funding now works, participating school districts
must start shrinking classes in first grade, then move onto second, and
finally third and kindergarten. The program requires that every class
have 20 students or fewer, or risk losing funding.</TE>
<TE>   But children "don't come in neat little packages that match
mathematical calculations," said Boyd of the Val Verde district. New
students constantly turn up throughout the year, forcing many districts
to set class sizes at 18, combine grades and bus extra students away from
their neighborhood schools to make the numbers add up. Add a 21st child
to a school in the program and it must open another classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Many school officials favor changing the law to allow them to go up to
22 students in some classes as long as the average class size at each
school remains at 20.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) said he plans to introduce such
a bill this spring. Similar bills have been unsuccessful in the past and
faced opposition from the state PTA and the California Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that there is already flexibility in the program,'
said Cecelia Mansfield, director of legislation for the California PTA.
Her organization wants class sizes to remain frozen at 20 for schools to
be eligible for the funding.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said such rigidity puts them in an impossible position.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of the movie 'Sophie's Choice,' " said Pat Clark White,
superintendent of the Irvine district, referring to the story in which a
mother must choose which of her children will die. "It's a list of
appalling choices."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Mickleson, mother of an Irvine fifth-grader, said that her son
had a great experience in his small third-grade class and that she would
be sorry to see younger students lose that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge problem [to lose the small classes]," she said. "I want
my son to get enough attention for the teacher to teach at the
appropriate level that he's at."</TE>

<HD>A Case of the Blahs in GOP Primary</HD>
<DH>Politics: Tenor of the lackluster race could change Tuesday, when
the three Republicans hoping to replace Gov. Davis meet for a debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Urgency crept into Secretary of State Bill Jones' voice as he
answered a question lobbed at him after a speech last week at the Richard
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace.</LD>
<LD>   "What people need to realize," the Republican candidate for governor
said, "is the election is coming right up, on March 5."</LD>
<LD>   That voters need a reminder of the three-way Republican primary--now
only 43 days away--says everything about the campaign to replace Democrat
Gray Davis, who is virtually guaranteed the nomination for his party.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no primary," scoffed Kam Kuwata, a veteran Democratic
political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Republican campaign has consisted largely of scripted
speeches to supportive gatherings or news conferences that draw a
smattering of reporters. The three candidates--Jones, former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan and businessman Bill Simon Jr.--spend most of their
speeches bashing Davis and devote little time to discussing which one of
them is most qualified to take him on.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Simon in particular have had a minimum of unscripted
interactions with voters that would require them to demonstrate their
skills at persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, whose handlers speak proudly of his charisma and personal
appeal, has begun making public appearances but has shied away from
discussing specifics on key matters, such as the budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of those working on the campaigns acknowledge that it has
been a tepid political season.</TE>
<TE>   "There is less attention in this primary for a gubernatorial race than
there has been historically," said consultant Sean Walsh, a veteran of
state Republican politics who is advising Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the race could change Tuesday, when the GOP gubernatorial
hopefuls meet for an hourlong debate in San Jose. It will be the first
higher-profile meeting of the three, and in theory could give Jones and
Simon their best opportunity to gain ground on Riordan, who is leading in
all early polls.</TE>
<TE>   California campaigns normally feature a minimum of public appearances
and a maximum of private fund-raising to bankroll television ads, which
are considered the best way to reach the state's vast and diffuse voting
population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlike other places like New Hampshire or Vermont, where you
would be going around and going to town meetings and walking precincts
and meeting people," said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain.</TE>
<TE>   This year, other factors have conspired to divert attention from the
race. The Sept. 11 terrorist actions and the subsequent war in
Afghanistan have drained public attention--and that of local television
stations--away from politics. The Olympics, which will begin less than a
month before election day, could further dilute attention.</TE>
<TE>   But, the biggest factor thus far may be the dynamic among the three
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, leading in fund-raising as well as polls, has chosen to
ignore and even laugh off the gibes of the other GOP candidates. Jones
speaks critically about Riordan as he campaigns, but badly trails him in
money. Simon, like Riordan a multimillionaire, lent himself $1.7 million
last month to stay competitive but has yet to go on the offensive against
his better-known rivals. He has refused to criticize Riordan, a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unusually slow primary because the person who has the will
doesn't have the means and the person who has the means doesn't have the
will," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon has the means but doesn't have the will to really sharply go
after Riordan. And Jones has the will but doesn't have the means to
sharply go after Riordan. And Riordan is happy to ignore them. You
basically have this conjunction of forces that conspires to give us a
non-primary."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the Jones and Simon campaigns disagree that the
outcome is predetermined. Both contend that the limited interest means
die-hard Republicans, who may disagree with Riordan's abortion-rights,
pro-gun-control positions or his past support of prominent Democrats,
will dominate the polls. There is plenty of time, they argue, to reach
those voters.</TE>
<TE>   Jones consultant Walsh said that by next month his candidate will have
enough money to air ads against Riordan. "People will wake up and pay
attention three weeks out from the race, and our money for direct voter
turnout will pay off," he said. "Anybody who's counting us out is really
making, like the Riordan campaign, a big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, a consultant for Simon, said his candidate--who has never
run for public office and who moved to the state 11 years ago--needs time
to introduce himself to California voters before drawing distinctions
between himself and Riordan. Simon launched radio ads last week and is
expected to hit the television airwaves soon.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make up big ground in this state," Russo said, "because
everyone makes up their mind late."</TE>
<TE>   This year's early primary makes it difficult to gauge when voters will
decide. Traditionally, state primaries have been held in June. Though
presidential primaries were moved up earlier, this is the first time a
gubernatorial vote will be held in March.</TE>
<TE>   "The March primary tends to be so close now to the end of the year and
the holidays, it's all of a sudden on you, and there's very little
time--unlike the old June primary--to get up a head of steam," said
veteran GOP consultant Ken Khachigian, who is neutral in this race.</TE>
<TE>   "In this particular case you have a unique situation," he added,
"where you have one person [Riordan] with overwhelming name ID in the
media market that covers roughly 46% of the entire state. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even begin to think how hard it is to combat that. That's
one of the principal reasons you're looking at the blahs right now;
there's just one candidate who's just overwhelmingly known and it's like
there's no one running against him."</TE>
<TE>   Khachigian said the Republican candidates could be more aggressive in
the number of public appearances they hold. But he cautioned that the
dynamics of the race could change in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll know a lot more a week from now and a week after that," he
said.</TE>

<HD>She Feeds Bodies and Souls</HD>
<DH>Mission: With a beat-up van, donated bread and homemade soup,
Gloria Kim travels the city with food and prayers for the homeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every morning, this frail 60-year-old minister with silver hair
revs up her old Dodge van and begins scouring Los Angeles street corners,
alleys and parks in search of the homeless and hungry.</LD>
<LD>   Her beat-up blue van is loaded with boxes of oranges and bananas, bags
of bread, piles of clothes and a steaming kettle of homemade soup. She
pulls up to a hovel, honks the horn and yells: "Hallelujah!" or "Hello,
my brother!"</LD>
<LD>   Her patrons call her "Mama" for her acts of charity--a bowl of soup, a
sack of nuts--hand-delivered with a prayer.</LD>
<TE>   For 15 years this has been Gloria Kim's routine, her sole mission. Her
van and her rosy-cheeked face are well-known among the homeless in
MacArthur Park, Lafayette Park, Koreatown, Griffith Park and downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Without my help many of the homeless people would be hungry, sick and
would even die out there without anybody ever noticing," Kim said. "I
prayed to God and said, 'Here I am, you gave me new life. You train me
and use me for whatever you need.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kim, a former nurse who turned her life over to religion nearly 20
years ago, founded the Zion Gospel Mission in 1986 in Los Angeles, along
with her late mother. Technically, it's a nonprofit organization. In
practice, it's a one-woman food kitchen, with a few helping hands.</TE>
<TE>   "She's here all the time," said LaTanya Walker, a 43-year-old homeless
woman at MacArthur Park, who prefers to be called Africa. "Through rain
or shine, her being sick, getting [parking] tickets. She never gives up
on us."</TE>
<TE>   During the week, Kim's day begins at 2 a.m. She spends the early
morning cooking soup made of tomatoes, potatoes, noodles and other
ingredients. Her huge stock pot can feed 300.</TE>
<TE>   By 4 a.m. she is driving to Griffith Park to pray facing the
mountains, she said. Then, she feeds three homeless people who sleep at
the park entrance. Next, she makes the rounds to businesses that donate
food and clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I give her bread. She's always happy," said Lawrence Choi, 34, owner
of Se Nue Bakery. "She's getting older and sometimes she's sick, but even
so, everyday she comes."</TE>
<TE>   Kim draws much of her support from small, Korean- and Latino-owned
business and churches concentrated in Koreatown. Also civic groups,
including the Korean-American Federation, give her money, surplus food
and used clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Hannan Supermarket recently held a fund-raiser, presenting her with
$2,000. Along with Se Nue Bakery, she also depends on Guatemalteca Bakery
and Restaurante for bread.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 a.m., Kim begins delivering food to people sleeping in
makeshift tents or gathering at parks.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, Kim stopped near 5th Street and Commonwealth
Avenue, where she saw a cardboard and shopping cart shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "Hallelujah! Good morning!"</TE>
<TE>   A woman inside the tent asked, "Can I have two soups this morning?"</TE>
<TE>   "Two soup? OK, two soup," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also gave the woman two pairs of pants, a bag of bananas, oranges
and sliced honeydew and several pieces of sweet bread.</TE>
<TE>   "Bye, Mama!" the homeless woman yelled, not coming out from under her
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "All right, have a good day," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, a few volunteers help Kim load and deliver food from the
old van, which was donated by a junk yard. Other days Kim works alone.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bleau, owner of B&amp;B Restaurant and Bakery Equipment Co. in Los
Angeles, met Kim 10 years ago when she asked him for pots and pans.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's this little woman, who probably only weighs 65 pounds, out
there doing this by herself," he said. "She needs someone to get behind
her . . . and help her establish an administrative section, and help her
get grants that are available."</TE>
<TE>   Bleau recalled that when a homeless man that Kim knew died, she
tracked down a suit to dress his body and persuaded a church to donate a
burial site.</TE>
<TE>   Kim immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea in 1976 and worked as a
nurse in Florida. Before that, she helped a community of exiled leprosy
patients in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Kim and her mother, Mok Lim Kim, moved to Los Angeles in 1984 and
began their ministry in 1986, feeding the homeless out of a Koreatown
garage they rented and lived in for $450 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The women became familiar faces on the street corners and in the parks
and alleys of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When Kim's mother died in 1990, she continued on her own. She supports
herself with the help of donations.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 26, 1997, fire destroyed the uninsured Koreatown house Kim had
just begun to rent, leaving her without a home or a kitchen for the Zion
Gospel Mission.</TE>
<TE>   When word spread, financial support poured in from the community, she
said. A year later, she had enough from donations and personal savings to
buy a two-room, $62,000 building on Venice Boulevard near Koreatown,
where Kim cooks, holds prayer services and allows homeless people to eat
and take showers.</TE>
<TE>   She rents a nearby two-bedroom house with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   She only serves healthy food such as fruit, bread, soup and nuts
because "a plain diet is good for them. It restores the body, the soul
and mind," she said. "All junk food is no good."</TE>
<TE>   Her friend Bleau donated a new kitchen, with an electric stove, two
refrigerators, cabinets, shelves, sinks and a ventilator to help continue
Kim's work in her new building.</TE>
<TE>   Kim wishes she had regular volunteers, or even an employee or two,
during the week. Her cataracts are giving her trouble, and she worries
about driving alone in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't stop her from leading a prayer service in front of
nearly 20 homeless and low-income people at MacArthur Park on Saturday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rich country, the United States. But there are many homeless
on the streets," she said. "They need socks. They need food. They need
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who has known Kim for 15 years, said the homeless respect her.</TE>
<TE>   "She used to drive through the alleyways. I don't know how she would
find me, but she would wake me up and tell me to eat," Walker said.
"She's heaven sent."</TE>

<LD>It's 7 in the morning on a school day and a bus is pulling up to
Christion Gagen's stop at Wilshire and Western, but he doesn't climb
aboard. This one's too crowded.</LD>
<LD>   "By the time I pay," says the 15-year-old University High School
student, "the seats would be gone."</LD>
<LD>   So he waits for another bus, then another, then another, then another,
then another, then another.</LD>
<TE>   Buses are chugging up every couple of minutes on the 720 Rapid line,
but more and more people are waiting to board, and Gagen is caught in
this daily game of jockeying and strategizing to get a seat for his
cross-town journey.</TE>
<TE>   "You got little old ladies hooking in and stepping right in front of
you," he says, holding his position and guarding his left flank. "I hope
people let me do the same thing when I get old."</TE>
<TE>   It could be worse. A bus on the 357 line has busted down at the peak
of rush hour and sits like a dying rhino on Western Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Gagen finally boards the seventh bus, which has plenty of seats. But
before we travel a mile west, between 10 and 15 people are standing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same when I come home," Gagen says. "After football
practice, you want a seat. But sometimes you'll have as many people
standing up as there are sitting down."</TE>
<TE>   The solution is apparent, it seems, to everyone except the people
running the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Two weeks ago, in a
decision that reopens the question of whether the "M" in MTA stands for
Misguided, or perhaps Mismanaged, the board voted to plow ahead with a
years-long, losing battle against a decree that would put more buses on
the street.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you buy the MTA's argument against more buses, there's a
problem here. The decree did not sail down out of the sky one day. The
MTA helped write it in response to charges that the agency was packing
low-income and minority riders into broken-down cattle coaches while
spending like thieves--$300 million a mile--on rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA, practicing an indecipherable form of math, has its own
peculiar ideas about how many buses it ought to buy and how many riders
ought to be standing up as a matter of routine. The problem is that
everyone but Judge Judy has looked at the decree, and not one person has
seen it the MTA's way.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge sided with bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   A special master sided with bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of federal judges sided with bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   A second panel of federal judges sided with bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   To even the most casual observer, a pattern seems to have developed.
And yet, undiscouraged by four straight whiffs and mounting legal costs,
the MTA board has voted to appeal to the highest court in all the land.</TE>
<TE>   John Fasana, the board chair, and Roger Snoble, the agency chief, told
me they need clarification on how to determine compliance with the
decree.</TE>
<TE>   Pay attention then, boys, and let's see if this helps clear it up:</TE>
<TE>   You lost. You lost. You lost. And you lost again.</TE>
<TE>   Buy more buses.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court justices are very busy people," says Eric Mann,
founder of the Bus Riders Union. "If you want more clarification, call
your psychiatrist."</TE>
<TE>   MTA bosses are also carping and moaning about not getting credit for
the improvements they've made.</TE>
<TE>   So here's some credit:</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the MTA has bought more buses and service seems to be better. The
Rapid line runs on short intervals and serves as a model for what bus
service can be, and there's a terrific bus-traffic supervisor at Wilshire
and Western who should be running the entire agency.</TE>
<TE>   Derick Mahome knows half the riders by name, and works up a sweat
helping them make connections as they come up from the train station or
other bus lines.</TE>
<TE>   But the bus division has 90% of MTA's riders and only half its budget.
We happen to be living in a county with 8 million cars, and the MTA just
doesn't know whether it makes sense to add 130 buses to a fleet of about
2,000.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred thirty buses.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the MTA is quibbling over in a region that violated clean
air standards 100 times in 2001. L.A. happens to be a place, I might add,
that's laid out in such a way that buses make more sense than rail.</TE>
<TE>   And then Fasana and Snoble have the nerve to argue that ridership on
all forms of public transportation is just not increasing enough to
justify big outlays.</TE>
<TE>   Well, first of all, boys, I don't recall any penny-pinching when MTA
royalty erected that half-billion-dollar palace in a city with downtown
buildings that sit vacant.</TE>
<TE>   And secondly, let me take a stab at just a few reasons ridership isn't
on the rise:</TE>
<TE>   * With the average bus ride between 60 and 90 minutes, no one wants to
have to stand up. So only those who have no choice--such as students like
Christion Gagen, or the housekeepers who commute to the Westside homes of
MTA lawyers and managers--are willing to go by bus.</TE>
<TE>   * The escalator at the south end of the Red Line Civic Center station
is broken more often than it's fixed, with stairs dismantled and stacked
against the wall like Rose Parade bleachers. Can anybody at the MTA find
the right screwdriver and fix this darn thing once and for all?</TE>
<TE>   * You're driving past Sunset and Figueroa during rush hour, and you
see armies of people on the street with looks of dread. What can it be?
Did they reinstitute the draft? No. They're waiting to horseshoe
themselves onto the next overcrowded bus. They could not possibly look
more miserable, and nothing in this picture tells you to park the car
tomorrow and go MTA, no matter how horrific traffic is.</TE>
<TE>   We need more buses, more trains, more bike lanes, and more good
reasons to get more people out of their cars.</TE>
<TE>   What we need most of all are leaders willing to reimagine the
metropolis, not reexamine the decree.</TE>
<TE>   Buy the buses already.</TE>

<HD>Cyber Cafe Crackdown Looms</HD>
<DH>Business: The Garden Grove City Council meets Tuesday to consider
restrictions on the proliferating computer sites after gang-related
crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Internet cafes springing up faster than any other business in
its city, the Garden Grove City Council is expected Tuesday to impose a
moratorium on permits for new cafes and place tighter controls on those
already open.</LD>
<LD>   The new ordinance, if passed, would reduce hours, require surveillance
cameras and restrict the number of computers to cut back on crowding.</LD>
<LD>   The city's crackdown stems from a series of criminal incidents, mostly
in parking areas surrounding the cafes.</LD>
<TE>   The most serious was Dec. 30, when a 20-year-old was stabbed to death
outside the PC Cafe on Garden Grove Boulevard. A 21-year-old suspected
gang member has been charged with murder.</TE>
<TE>   "After the stabbing incident, it dawned on us that we really haven't
taken a hard look at these places," said Garden Grove Mayor Bruce
Broadwater.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Oh, owner of the PC Cafe, said he can easily comply with most
of the proposed ordinances. He installed security cameras and hired a
security guard after the stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   But having to cut back the closing hour to midnight will hurt his
business, he said. He said he will express his concerns at the Tuesday
meeting about that and limits on the number of computers, and he expects
that other owners will also bring their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   One owner who welcomes the new regulations is Diane Vo, co-owner of
the Vietnamese Internet Center on Brookhurst Street, which will open next
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I can comply with all these regulations," she said. "This can only be
good for everybody's business. We don't want gangs any more than anyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   Cyberspace cafes are generally operated in storefronts, with rows of
computers set up to provide high-powered Internet access to customers who
have no computers at home. Almost all charge a $2 hourly fee.</TE>
<TE>   While some customers use them for information access or to check their
e-mail, the vast majority of young people who frequent these places use
them to play video games.</TE>
<TE>   The PC Cafe, for example, holds two game contests daily that it calls
"frag parties." On a recent afternoon, nearly all its 58 computers were
being used, and every customer was playing video games.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, said City Manager George Tindall, some of these places
become hangouts and attract gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Police say seven gang-related incidents have occurred at cyber cafes
in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, these places were going into operation faster than we
could get a handle on them," Tindall said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the city had two cyber cafes. Three opened in 2000.
But last year, 13 opened, and two more have permits to open soon.</TE>
<TE>   Many other cities around Orange County have the computer storefronts
as well, but the numbers in Garden Grove outstrip the others.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny city of La Palma last year became the first in the county to
issue regulations on the businesses, but Garden Grove's would be the most
sweeping ordinance controlling existing cafes and establishing zoning for
new ones. The moratorium would be temporary, Tindall said, until the city
can study how cyber cafes can fit into the city's land-use plans, which
may take until the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium would take effect immediately. The new regulations
would give existing businesses 90 days to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new rules, the cafes would be required to close at midnight.
Most are now open until 2 a.m., and some until 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The city also would limit the number of computers to one per 20 square
feet of floor space. Right now some of the cafes are so jammed with
computers that they violate the fire code, according to a city staff
report.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes would require each cafe to install police-approved
security cameras, eliminate the dark lighting and install clear windows.
Almost all of them now have dark windows.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Choi, who operates First Visions, an eyeglass store next to the
PC Cafe, said he has had to call the police "many times" because of crowd
problems there, both in front and in back of the cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "The city needs to do something; the place just gets out of control,"
Choi said.</TE>
<TE>   A month before the stabbing death, for example, two teenagers were
assaulted by four people with baseball bats and wrenches just outside the
cafe.</TE>
<TE>   The police believe that some of the attackers were members of what is
called a "PC Clan," a group that plays certain computer games as a team,

<HD>Private Eye School Puts Students on Trail of Jobs</HD>
<DH>Careers: Van Nuys academy is trying to meet a growing need for
investigators to do background checks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the images of Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade--hard-drinking
private eyes who were quick to use their fists or pull the trigger.</LD>
<LD>   Today's private investigator is more likely to resemble Dale Upton, a
bearded, bespectacled man who quickly admits he would rather turn and run
than shoot it out.</LD>
<LD>   "No job is worth dying for," said Upton, lead instructor and
investigator of the Nick Harris Detective Academy in Van Nuys. "That's
the first lesson."</LD>
<TE>   The 95-year-old agency has helped train some of the 9,657 licensed
private investigators in California, of whom 2,210 are in Los Angeles
County. Nick Harris, a former crime reporter and police officer, founded
the agency that now claims to be the oldest school for private
investigators in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Harris school is part of an industry that has been booming.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, there is more interest in background checks, and I
can see where private investigators' business would increase," said Kevin
Flanagan, spokesman for the state Department of Consumer Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Friedman, 42, president of the Harris academy, said "there are
more jobs than we can place" graduates in.</TE>
<TE>   The walls of the cluttered Oxnard Street office are covered with
plaques and framed letters from dignitaries, including a 1987 letter from
then-Vice President George Bush congratulating the school for 80 years of
service.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-week course, which runs seven hours a day, five days a week,
costs $4,775.</TE>
<TE>   But to acquire a California private investigators license, a graduate
must have three years' paid experience and pass a state test.</TE>
<TE>   The Harris curriculum includes classes on finding missing persons,
stealth photography, insurance fraud and accidents, surveillance and
criminal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The classes are taught by Upton, 45, a licensed private investigator
and Harris graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Upton was first exposed to the life of a private eye when he was 11.
His mother landed a part-time job with an investigator, often doing
surveillance on suspected philanderers.</TE>
<TE>   "She would take me and my brother on surveillance," Upton recalled,
sitting in a classroom with cameras, computers, videos and books. "I'd
knock on the door of the suspect and ask, 'Have you seen my dog?' then
report back to Mom."</TE>
<TE>   Upton's first paid job came in 1985, when a warehouse manager hired
him to track a family member who was stealing the merchandise and selling
it at swap meets. For weeks, Upton prowled swap meets until he found the
man selling the goods in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a waste of time," Upton said, "but when I found him,
it was such a rush--such an Adrenalin dump on my system."</TE>
<TE>   Upton tells his students that they are not going to solve every case
in 60 minutes, like TV investigators. It takes patience. But even with
patience, some cases will not be solved.</TE>
<TE>   Many cases involve spouses suspected of cheating. But those cases
sometimes take unexpected turns.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman cited a case in which after several weeks, he concluded the
husband was not having sex with another woman, but rather taking her
dancing. "The lady that hired us was more upset that he was out dancing
three times a week than if he had been out having sex once a week,"
Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the academy's entrance examination recently was Jaden King, 31,
of Santa Clarita, who said he is tired of laying tile.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a private investigator was something I always found
intriguing," King said. "Being undercover, finding information on people
without them knowing about it, it's kind of exciting."</TE>
<TE>   King said he is particularly looking forward to using high-tech
undercover gadgets, such as a video camera inserted inside a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Another device tracks where a phone call is coming from.</TE>
<TE>   "You've seen the movies where the bad guy is on the pay phone and the
cop says, 'Keep him on the line for two minutes so we can track him,' "
Friedman said. "We have this unit that can instantly track the location
of the phone."</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, Hector Looy, 30, of Northridge, will graduate. He is
eager to get started.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Looy was helping remodel the home of an FBI agent who
overheard him complaining about his income.</TE>
<TE>   "So this FBI agent says if I want to make some easy money I should
become a private investigator," Looy recalled. "It sounded interesting,
but I had no idea there was a school for it."</TE>
<TE>   Then three months ago, while driving down Oxnard Street, Looy noticed
the Harris academy's sign on the side of a building.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, he enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to be here," he said. "I can't wait to get out and start
being a real private investigator."</TE>

<HD>Sides Agree on Canal Upgrade, but Not on How</HD>
<DH>Venice: Legal action by environmental groups stalls project. They
say they fear for ecology; city says residents are desperate for cleanup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell Ruffing, a Los Angeles city engineer, and Marcia Hanscom,
an environmental activist, see the same woeful site when they gaze at the
southern end of the Grand Canal in Venice: a waterway badly in need of a
face lift.</LD>
<LD>   The canal's dirt banks are crumbling. Million-dollar homes along the
canal overlook water that is clogged with sandbags, plastic tarps,
discarded clothing and takeout food containers. Concrete sidewalks
paralleling the canal are cracked or broken.</LD>
<LD>   Both Ruffing and Hanscom envision a restored canal with new storm
drains, native vegetation, improved water quality and fenced, safe
walkways.</LD>
<TE>   But their agreement stops there.</TE>
<TE>   The city hopes to transform the Grand Canal into something closer to
its cousins to the north, the Venice Canal and its tributaries, whose
neatly manicured, mostly concrete banks rarely overflow. The nonprofit
Wetlands Action Network, of which Hanscom is executive director, hopes
for something more like the Ballona Lagoon to the south, a marine
preserve with sloping banks, decomposed granite paths and its own Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have become locked in a court battle over how the canal
should be restored. After the city began installing a bypass line to
allow water to flow from the Ballona Lagoon to the canals north of
Washington Boulevard, the first step in damming, draining and dredging
the Grand Canal, the Wetlands Action Network filed suit against the city
and the California Coastal Commission in Superior Court, saying the work
would cause "irreparable harm" to the ecosystem of the canal.</TE>
<TE>   The group was later joined in the suit by the Ballona Wetlands Land
Trust, the Coalition to Save the Marina and the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Judge James A. Robertson issued a stay last week ordering that most
work on the Grand Canal be halted.</TE>
<TE>   Although Robertson's order allowed removal of damaged sidewalks and
nonnative vegetation and construction of storm drain catch basins and
fences to continue, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who
represents the neighborhood around the canal, said the project has
suffered an almost irreversible setback.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.5-million project, which would be funded by residents through
an assessment program, has been in the works for almost 10 years, on the
drawing boards for 25. The 1,000-foot-long Grand Canal is the last piece
of a restoration project that includes the Venice Canal network north of
Washington Boulevard and the Ballona Lagoon, which feeds into Marina del
Rey.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission, which has jurisdiction over the project,
approved it last November after the city made adjustments to its original
proposal to further reduce the project's impact on sensitive habitat
areas. A tight timeline established by the commission required that all
work on the canal be completed before April 30, when the local population
of least terns, an endangered bird, returns to feed. The next hearing on
the canal restoration is scheduled for March 12.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way we can do the project this year," Galanter said. "For
at least another year, the area will remain unrestored, uncleaned up, and
it will just be sitting there. I am very unhappy that people will do this
in the name of environmental protection."</TE>
<TE>   Under the city's plan, the Grand Canal would be drained of an
estimated 2,000 cubic feet of debris, trash and polluted sediments; storm
drains would be installed; nonnative plants would be removed and replaced
with wetland vegetation; access ways would be improved or replaced, and
the banks of the canal reinforced. In some areas, concrete "Loffelstein
blocks" would be used to shore up the banks.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the disagreement between the Wetlands Action Network and the
city focuses on those blocks, which the city has already used along the
Venice Canal, and on the draining and dredging of the canal. The blocks,
said Hanscom, are nothing more than concrete planters, which would
prevent the native plants from taking root.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have different goals," she said. "The city's goal is to
have something nice and neat. Our goal is to have something ecologically
correct. We are not even sure why they feel they need to rake up the
canal."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mess--a major mess," said Ruffing, who works in the city
Bureau of Engineering, Environmental Group. Of the residents who will pay
for the project, he said, "We already have 18 people who have paid the
full amount. If this process stalls, we have to refund their money. All
of this delay creates administrative costs, and the assessment district
will pay. You are always going to have people against it. But the fact is
that the people who live there want it and are paying for it."</TE>
<TE>   For Tony Busching, a 70-year-old TV producer who lives on Grand Canal
Court in a home facing the canal, all of this bickering is infuriating.
He and his wife, Carol, have already paid their $9,800 assessment fee and
were looking forward to an improved vista from their patio.</TE>
<TE>   "Between the Coastal Commission and the wetland people," he said, "it
seems as if they have nothing to do but complain."</TE>
<TE>   Busching is frustrated by the judge's stay. "The environmentalists are
just not practical. They're doing whatever they can to stop it. If only
they saw how bad it is, with the broken concrete, the trash. . . . It's a
pigpen down here, and I don't see any of these people who are so
concerned doing anything about it."</TE>

<HD>Where to Bury Abandoned Babies Debated</HD>
<DH>Children: Woman has laid 48 infants to rest in Riverside County.
But funeral directors have another idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debi Faris says she remembers the story of each of the 48 children
she's buried. Since 1996, she has been recovering the bodies of murdered
and abandoned babies throughout Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside
counties and burying them in her private Garden of Angels in Riverside
County's Calimesa Cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   "Every child has a story," said Faris, 46, of Yucaipa. "And every
child is given a name. We give them a proper burial service to build a
circle of love around the child. The children belong to all of us."</LD>
<LD>   But Faris, who has worked closely with investigators at the Los
Angeles County coroner's office for more than five years, feels she is
being pushed aside by a larger, more powerful organization that recently
expressed interest in caring for the abandoned babies in Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<TE>   County officials say they are considering a proposal that would allow
members of the Los Angeles County Funeral Directors Assn. to bury
newborns found in local areas, but are uncertain when a decision will be
made.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the association say communities are better served
if newborns recovered in Los Angeles County are buried in cemeteries that
serve the communities where they are found.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make sense to bury children in [Riverside County] if they
passed away in our communities," said Robert Risher, a media
representative for the association. "For example, if the infant is
Hispanic and was found in a predominantly Latin community, we'd work with
a Catholic archdiocese cemetery to arrange a burial."</TE>
<TE>   Risher said the headstones would be marked John or Jane Doe. There
would be an inscription indicating where and when the baby was found.</TE>
<TE>   The marked name is just one thing Faris has taken issue with. "These
children stand for something out there. What would they stand for in
graves marked John and Jane Doe?" she said. "I'll be damned if I stand
still for that. If we take away the power for the children's voices, then
shame on us."</TE>
<TE>   Faris, who has three adult children, said she was moved to create the
Garden of Angels and Safe Arms for Newborns organization while watching
the evening news in 1996. Police had recovered a newborn boy who had been
thrown along the side of a freeway, stuffed in a duffel bag.</TE>
<TE>   "It compelled me to stop in my life and do something," Faris said. She
founded the not-for-profit organization and became a vocal advocate,
lecturing at school assemblies and at colleges. Two years ago, her
organization was instrumental in getting a state law passed that allows
mothers to leave unwanted newborns anonymously at hospital emergency
rooms within 72 hours of birth without threat of prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The Garden of Angels has three full-time employees, including Faris,
and an eight-member board of directors. The organization has a $200,000
annual operating budget, according to financial secretary Sheryl Odell.
The funding comes from grants and donations; most of the money raised
goes to an educational and advertising campaign to publicize the
1-year-old law.</TE>
<TE>   Though Faris said her aim is to prevent mothers from abandoning
unwanted children, much of her work revolves around the tidy garden in
Calimesa, lined with crosses bearing the names of the children she's
buried. Faris purchased the burial space--originally with room for 40
graves--in 1996 for $27,000. Over the years, the organization purchased
enough space to bury 95 infants, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six of the 48 children buried there are from Los Angeles
County, Odell said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials frequently call Faris when a dead infant is
found. Faris often asks the investigators to name the children, although
sometimes Faris and her husband, Mark, select names.</TE>
<TE>   She personally retrieves each child from the coroner's office and
wraps the baby in donated blankets, blue or pink depending on the child's
gender. At each memorial, a clergy person, usually a board member or
someone from the community, delivers a brief message. A volunteer usually
reads a poem dedicated to the child. And the small group that gathers at
the site sings special songs. At the end of the service, Faris releases a
collection of doves--one for each child buried in the garden.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think that I was giving something to them," she said of the
children. "But each of them leaves something very special with me."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when Faris arrived at the coroner's office to retrieve the
bodies of "Francis" and "Christian," newborns discovered in Hollenbeck
area Dumpsters in October, officials refused to release the bodies to
her. They said the L.A. County Funeral Directors Assn. was assuming that
responsibility, Faris recalled.</TE>
<TE>   County officials relented, releasing the infants in time for a Dec. 23
memorial. But Craig Harvey, the coroner's chief of operations, said the
office still is interested in working with the funeral directors
association.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the association said they've been trying, without
much success, to donate services for the last seven years. Larry Hawkins,
past president of the association and chairman of the group's Coroner's
Committee, said he first submitted a proposal to the administrative
director of the coroner's office, Tony Hernandez, in 1995 outlining a
plan to provide caskets, funeral services and space to bury abandoned
newborns. The group never received approval.</TE>
<TE>   The organization, which has 90 members, tried again in 1998, Hawkins
said, but nothing happened. In February, the association submitted a
third proposal. "In the meantime, Debi Faris came on the scene and has
been involved with the babies," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally put it to Mr. Hernandez that we got the feeling he didn't
want us involved. He apologized, but said whatever happened, the Garden
of Angels would have to be involved," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins and other members of the group say that although they commend
Faris for the work she's done, they are "concerned that babies are being
taken 100 to 250 miles away."</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been my belief that babies should be buried in the
geographic areas where they are found," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we have to send angels to another area to be buried?"
asked Risher, corporate president of Risher Montebello Mortuary. "Usually
babies are found in the area where their families live. Having services
here can maybe do something to help their families. We can publicize the
story of what happened to these children locally."</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said he is working out a rotation schedule that would allow the
Garden of Angels and the funeral directors association to bury the
babies.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said he's convinced that Faris "does her work out of love" for
the children, but he's spoken to representatives of the association who
have assured him that they will provide the same "level of service" that
Faris has provided.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jean Huston, justice deputy to county Supervisor Michael
Antonovich, said the Board of Supervisors will make the final decision

know when the board will act.</TE>

<TE>   Until the board makes a decision, all the babies will be released to
the Garden of Angels organization, Huston said.</TE>

<LD>The environmental health division of Orange County's Health Care
Agency performs routine, unannounced inspections of the county's more
than 11,000 restaurants, markets and other food establishments. When
conditions violate state law or applicable county and municipal codes,
inspectors can issue notices of violation. If inspectors find during an
announced recheck that conditions have not been corrected, they can
effectively close the business by suspending its health permit. Health
permits are reinstated as soon as the situation is corrected. Here is a

<HD>City's Utility Tax: One Down, One to Vote</HD>
<DH>Finance: Los Alamitos residents will see their levy on electricity
fall by a fourth. They'll also be asked whether the 6% users tax on all
utilities should continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to public complaints about utility taxes that soared
last summer with escalating electricity rates, Los Alamitos is cutting
the tax on electric power usage by a fourth and will ask voters in
November whether the 6% tax they pay on all their utilities should be
repealed.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the electricity tax reduction, set to go into effect
next month, would have little impact on municipal finances because it
will merely lower revenue to the same level the city collected before
electric rates went up.</LD>
<LD>   But the $1.8 million raised by the overall levy on all utility bills
constitutes slightly more than 20% of the city's $8.8-million general
fund budget, and loss of this income is something the city could ill
afford, they said.</LD>
<TE>   A California Supreme Court ruling, however, gave them little choice in
the matter of a citywide vote. They are hoping Los Alamitos voters will
follow the example of Stanton's and extend the tax.</TE>
<TE>   "The court said this was something that had to be put to the voters,"
Councilwoman Alice Jempsa said. "I'm sure that's why other cities in our
area did so. Each month that tax is collected, it's illegal to do so--if
we are challenged."</TE>
<TE>   Jempsa said the two council decisions--to roll back the tax on
electricity and put the tax on all utilities to a popular vote--were
taken separately, and for different reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a coincidence that they came up at the same time," she
said. "I was getting so much input from residents and businesses about
how much the tax had gone up. The people I talked to, especially the
businesses, were saying that they were paying so much more than they had
previously."</TE>
<TE>   By cutting the tax on electricity by a fourth, Los Alamitos residents
"would be paying about as many dollars as they did prior to 1999" and
getting a needed tax break, Jempsa said.</TE>
<TE>Users Tax Rose With Rates; City Responds</TE>
<TE>   Resident Tom Kneeshaw saw his electricity bill rise from last year's
$150 to $160 a month to about $260 a month lately. "That's outrageous,"
Kneeshaw said, "and my neighbors' [bills] are pretty much the same."</TE>
<TE>   Since tax collections went up in lock-step with rising power rates,
Los Alamitos and other cities suddenly found themselves sitting on
windfalls. In Los Alamitos' case, it went from collecting $640,796 in
electricity taxes in 1999 to a projected $925,000 in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "Some local governments are doing the right thing . . . and have
realized that the local government should not be making a windfall on the
backs of taxpayers," said John Cappell, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. "They're feeling the heat from taxpayers who are
requesting reductions or eliminations of the utility users tax."</TE>
<TE>   Utility taxes are a legacy of California's last economic downturn in
the early 1990s, when the state took larger shares of revenue that had
been going to cities and counties. More than 100 cities reacted to these
revenue losses with user taxes on utility bills.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these taxes were vulnerable to legal challenge, since they
were seldom, if ever, approved by voters as required under Proposition
62. That proposition, adopted in 1986, requires voter approval of new or
increased taxes by a two-thirds majority.</TE>
<TE>   The Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn. made a test case of La Habra's
utility taxes, which the Supreme Court nullified in June.</TE>
<TE>Court Decision on Levy Leads to Ballot Measure</TE>
<TE>   The high court justices stopped short of deciding that all such taxes
were unconstitutional, limiting their ruling to the facts of the La Habra
case. But that left other cities that had done the same thing in the
uncomfortable position of waiting for a challenge and its foregone
conclusion, or getting the tax ratified by popular vote.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos is choosing to let voters decide. Stanton put the tax
before voters in November, and it was approved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the message we are trying to send [with both actions] is if
there is an opportunity to reduce the utility users tax, we will do so,"
City Manager Bob Dominguez said. "But we want to tell them that we need
that tax."</TE>
<TE>   The city uses utility tax revenue to help pay for police, fire, parks,
street maintenance and other services.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say, 'I never use the park, I could care less,' and some
others say, 'We've got to have those soccer fields.' So as essential as
the taxes are to the city's delivery of services, there are no
guarantees," Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Kneeshaw, for one, is in favor of keeping the taxes, while applauding
the reduction in the electricity portion.</TE>
<TE>   "The utility tax is one of the very few taxes that you can see exactly
where it goes," Kneeshaw said. "Most go to Washington or Sacramento and
come back as cents on the dollar."</TE>
<TE>   But because all of the utility tax goes directly to the city, "you can
have some say in what happens to it," he said. "So of all the taxes there
are, it's one of the fairest."</TE>

<HD>King's Legacy in Prayer, Song</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Irvine's oldest and largest black church brings
together a multiethnic crowd at the Marriott to honor the civil rights
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A typical conference room at the Irvine Marriott seemed an unlikely
spot for a celebration honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but
there it was Sunday morning: Members of the Christ Our Redeemer African
Methodist Episcopal Church clasping hands and singing "We Shall
Overcome."</LD>
<LD>   Somehow the location felt right.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't matter where church is, said the Rev. Mark Whitlock,
because God hears prayers everywhere--even at the Marriott. And on
Sunday, the assassinated civil rights leader probably would have been
proud to see the multiethnic, multicultural congregation gathered to
honor him in a city that is predominantly white and less than 2% African
American.</LD>
<TE>   "It is time for us to stop being colorblind and to start being color
rich," Whitlock said. "Despite Enron, despite Osama bin Laden, despite
the Ku Klux Klan, despite the other entities that will preach hate, we
must learn to love each other despite our differences."</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock delivered a rousing sermon, "The Living Legacy of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.," before about 150 people who normally gather for worship
in a UC Irvine lecture hall. The service included performances by a
20-member band and choir, whose hand-clapping and swelling voices made it
seem much larger.</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock reminded the congregation--Irvine's oldest and largest black
church--of the sacrifices King made and the tools he used to further his
message--song, suffering, service and "good soil" (faith and belief in
God).</TE>
<TE>   He peppered the sermon with quotes from King: "Darkness cannot drive
out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only
love can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock closed his remarks with a slide and audio presentation that
included photos of King along with excerpts of his speeches and music.</TE>
<TE>   It moved Frank Barner, 55, of Tustin to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking of all the things I've personally been through,"
Barner said. "It just caught me, and I felt very full. It's just very
emotional for me."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on King's legacy, Barner said, "There's so many things we
would not have."</TE>
<TE>   Barner recalled when he first moved to Orange County in 1973 and was
searching for a place to live. He called apartment complexes, and
managers would say there was space available.</TE>
<TE>   But when he arrived to fill out an application, the managers would
tell him they had nothing available. "We have a lot to be thankful for,"
Barner said. "We've come a long, long way."</TE>
<TE>   In a scholarship luncheon after the service, about 250 people gathered
to recognize Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona as "Man of the Year" and
UCI student Tenisha Powers, winner of a church-sponsored essay contest
entitled "A Vision Beyond a Crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Powers wrote that King's teachings are particularly relevant as
suspicions and hate crimes rose against people of Arab descent following
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third year the church has handed out scholarships. Last
year, it awarded $5,000. This year, church officials hope the amount will
grow to $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby McDonald, president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Orange
County, said the chamber, the church and the Newport-Mesa-Irvine
Interfaith Council sponsored the event to increase public awareness of
King and to show that today's holiday is for everyone, not just African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "His promissory note was for all--life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness for everyone," McDonald said.</TE>

<HD>2 Sod Growers Mow Down the Competition</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: The Ventura County farms have helped make California
second only to Florida in sales of turf for lawns, fields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Rogers spends his days watching the grass grow, but it's
not as easy as it sounds.</LD>
<LD>   That is because the lawn he is looking after stretches hundreds of
acres across the Oxnard Plain, a carefully manicured meadow as flat as a
carpet and green as a $100 bill.</LD>
<LD>   Turf is his trade. And as co-owner of Pacific Earth Resources, one of
the largest sod producers in a state known for its evergreen lawns, he is
on a mission to make everyone's grass just a little bit greener.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're after is dark green, green all year around with low water
usage and low chemical needs," said the 60-year-old rancher, rambling in
a minivan down a rutted dirt road toward a trio of harvesters expertly
slicing a sod carpet into 4-foot lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "Those plants right there are as happy as they can be because we
treated them properly," he said. "Golf courses should have grass that
looks this good."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to him, some do.</TE>
<TE>   The Camarillo-based company has supplied swaths of sod to golf courses
across Southern California, including the prestigious Sherwood Country
Club near Thousand Oaks. It has made greener the grounds of the Playboy
Mansion, Oprah Winfrey's Montecito home and the Pontiac Silverdome in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Earth has even received screen credit for its work with
Hollywood, including a mention at the end of "Field of Dreams" for
conjuring up a baseball diamond in the middle of an Iowa cornfield.</TE>
<TE>   And quietly over the years, along with neighbor and competitor
Southland Sod Farms, it has helped establish Ventura County as a
turf-grass Mecca--a place known as much for its fescue and bluegrass as
for its citrus and strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the two companies farm about a quarter of the land dedicated
to sod production statewide. Their market hold is tightest in Southern
California, where they have ridden the region's housing boom.</TE>
<TE>   "[Ventura County is] the sod capital of California," said Jurgen
Gramckow, 53, managing partner at Southland Sod, which farms about 1,200
acres. "Everywhere you see sod [in Southern California], there's a good
chance that either we or Pacific would have been the supplier."</TE>
<TE>   The companies' sod stories are intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Green Sod, as it was initially known, was first to get off the
ground. It was founded in 1968 by Gramckow's father, Werner, a West
German immigrant who studied accounting at UCLA and landed a job in 1960
with Cal-Turf in Camarillo, a West Coast pioneer in turf growing.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, when the elder Gramckow decided to strike out on his own,
he enlisted his son--by then a Stanford graduate with an engineering
degree--and leased 100 acres from Tom Davis, a rancher whose family had
been in Ventura County for generations and farmed thousands of acres on
the Oxnard Plain.</TE>
<TE>   Davis died in 1974, leaving the land to his family, including his
daughter, Beth. Two years later, diverging grass-growing philosophies
prompted the Gramckows to again set out on their own, this time to start
Southland Sod.</TE>
<TE>   That left Pacific Sod in the hands of Beth Davis, who in 1978 married
Richard Rogers. The couple co-own the business, although Richard oversees
most farm operations while Beth has been busy lately running for the seat
held by Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, whose district includes portions of
western Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>Farms Respected in Turf Industry</TE>
<TE>   The two companies exist now as cordial competitors, separated by only
a few miles on the flats that stretch between Oxnard and Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Southland is the bigger of the two in Southern California in terms of
acreage. But Pacific is bigger overall, farming about 2,000 acres at five
farms from Patterson in Stanislaus County to Indio in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Turf-grass experts say both sod farms are well respected and have
helped California become an industry leader.</TE>
<TE>   The state's sod producers farm about 12,000 acres. In 1997, the most
recent year for which statistics are available, California was second
only to Florida in turf-grass sales, with the state's sod companies
generating more than $124 million in revenues that year.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Southland and Pacific] have extremely good reputations," said
Doug Fender, executive director of the 1,200-member Turfgrass Producers
International, a Chicago-based trade association. "They are definitely
among the leaders in the industry. And they've done a wonderful job
building a name for themselves and their products."</TE>
<TE>   It's possible, some in the grass-growing business say, that the
industry has hit its peak. A general slowdown in construction, a shift to
smaller lot sizes and concerns about water availability have all taken a
bite out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the rapid growth years are behind us," Gramckow said. "I
would characterize this as a mature industry. I don't see any great boom,
nor are we going to see any bust."</TE>
<TE>   On the rutted roads that crisscross Pacific Earth's sod fields, a
steadier pace is just fine with Richard Rogers. He said there was a time
when he thought it important to be the biggest sod producer. Now he just
wants to be one of the best.</TE>
<TE>   That is why workers go through 16 steps--from laser-leveling the
ground to turning on the water--to prepare seedbeds for planting. It's
why he has hundreds of sod tests running at any one time, measuring
everything from water intake to weed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   And it's why he has poured more than $1 million into a
state-of-the-art computer system that catalogs orders and tracks
deliveries in real time.</TE>
<TE>Putting Down Roots for Future Growth</TE>
<TE>   The company has 12,000 active customers and last year completed more
than 80,000 deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized early on that if you took modern business practices and
applied them to what is essentially a farming operation, we could make
this company grow," Rogers said. "When you are doing something like this,
you have the opportunity to make your own market."</TE>
<TE>   He's not finished yet.</TE>
<TE>   As Rogers eases a company minivan along narrow dirt roads, the
vehicle's tires crunch to a stop at the edge of a tarp-covered field.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plastic, a carpet of wildflowers is growing--a ground cover
pioneered by Pacific Earth. Nearby, another Pacific invention is taking
root in the form of grass grown hydroponically in a special planting mix,
made up of recycled organic material infused with nutrients, laid out on
sheets of plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Because the roots are never cut, Rogers explains, this is the
highest-quality grass the company grows and is a favorite of high-end
hotels and Hollywood set designers. But he said he is just as satisfied
when he is providing green space to parks, ball fields and backyards.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the industry has a lot of future," said Rogers, who left the
money-management business to watch the grass grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Our business here is improving people's lives," he said. "It's just a
wonderful feeling when I know it's going to go to a place that by
definition will provide great comfort and joy."</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Council Considers Cyber Cafe Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Zoning: Violence wasn't only in the games, so the community decided
to look at controlling hours and computers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With cyber cafes springing up faster than any other business in
Garden Grove, the City Council is expected Tuesday to impose a moratorium
on permits for new cafes and place tighter controls on those already
open.</LD>
<LD>   If passed, the ordinance would reduce hours, require surveillance
cameras and restrict the number of computers to reduce overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   The crackdown stems from a series of crimes, mostly in parking areas
surrounding the cafes. The most serious was Dec. 30, when a 20-year-old
man was stabbed to death while standing outside the PC Cafe on Garden
Grove Boulevard. A 21-year-old suspected gang member has been charged
with murder in that death.</LD>
<TE>   "After the stabbing incident, it dawned on us that we really haven't
taken a hard look at these places," Mayor Bruce Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Oh, owner of the PC Cafe, said he can easily comply with most
provisions of the proposed ordinance. He installed security cameras and
hired a guard after the fatal stabbing. But being forced to close by
midnight, as the ordinance would require, will hurt his business, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh said he will express his concerns about that and the computer
limits at Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   One owner who welcomes new regulations is Diane Vo, co-owner of the
Vietnamese Internet Center on Brookhurst Street, which will open next
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I can comply with all these regulations," she said. "This can only be
good for everybody's business. We don't want gangs any more than anyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   Cyber cafes are generally in storefronts, with rows of computers set
up to provide high-speed Internet access to customers who do not have it
at home. Almost all charge a $2 hourly fee.</TE>
<TE>   While some customers use the computers for information access or to
check their e-mail, the majority of young people who frequent cyber cafes
play video games.</TE>
<TE>   The PC Cafe, for example, holds two contests daily that it calls "frag
parties." On a recent afternoon, nearly all of its 58 computers were in
use, and every customer was playing video games.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, said City Manager George Tindall, some of these places
become hangouts and attract gang members. Police say seven gang-related
incidents have occurred at cyber cafes in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, these places were going into operation faster than we
could get a handle on them," Tindall said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the city had two cyber cafes. Three opened in 2000.
But last year, 13 opened and two more have permits to open soon.</TE>
<TE>La Palma First With Regulations</TE>
<TE>   Many other cities around Orange County have the computer storefronts
as well, but the numbers in Garden Grove outstrip them.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny city of La Palma last year became the first in the county to
issue regulations for the businesses, but Garden Grove's would be the
most sweeping ordinance to control existing cafes and establish zoning
for new ones.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium would be temporary, Tindall said, until the city
studies how cyber cafes can fit into its land-use plans, which may take
until the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium would take effect immediately. The new regulations
would give existing businesses 90 days to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed rules, cyber cafes would be required to close at
midnight. Most are now open until 2 a.m., and some until 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The city also would limit the number of computers to one per 20 square
feet of floor space. Some cafes are so jammed with computers that they
violate fire codes, according to a city report.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes would require each cafe to install police-approved
security cameras, eliminate dark lighting and install clear windows.
Almost all of them now have dark windows.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Choi, who operates First Visions, an eyeglass store next to the
PC Cafe, said he has had to call the police "many times" because of crowd
problems in front and in back of the cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "The city needs to do something; the place just gets out of control,"
Choi said.</TE>
<TE>   Just a month before the stabbing death, for example, two teenagers
were assaulted by four people wielding baseball bats and wrenches just
outside the cafe. Police think some of the attackers were members of what
is called a "PC Clan," groups of people who play certain computer games
as a team, competing against other teams.</TE>
<TE>New Cafe to Appeal to Adults</TE>
<TE>   At the Net to Net cyber cafe on Garden Grove Boulevard, 10 attackers
assaulted a young customer in November.</TE>
<TE>   Vo said she expects her business to appeal to adults, not young people
playing video games.</TE>
<TE>   Quang Nguyen, a co-owner of I.C.E. Internet Cafe on Brookhurst Street,
hopes the city will make an exception for him on the opening end of the
new hours. The proposed ordinance won't let the cafes open until 7 a.m.,
but Nguyen said he does a rush coffee business after opening at 6 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium on new cyber cafes would remain in effect pending a
zoning study by the Planning Department, which would then recommend
permanent regulations.</TE>

<HD>Church Honors King With Festive Service at Hotel</HD>
<DH>Holiday: About 150 members of Irvine's oldest black congregation
hear a tribute to the civil rights leader and rousing musical
performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A typical conference room at the Marriott Hotel in Irvine may have
seemed an unlikely spot for a Martin Luther King Jr. celebration, but
there it was Sunday morning: Members of the Christ Our Redeemer African
Methodist Episcopal Church clasping hands and singing "We Shall
Overcome."</LD>
<LD>   Somehow the location felt right.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't matter where church is, said the Rev. Mark Whitlock,
because God hears prayers everywhere--even at the Marriott. And Sunday,
King probably would have been proud to see the multiethnic, multicultural
congregation gathered to honor him in a city that is predominantly white
and less than 2% African American.</LD>
<TE>   "It is time for us to stop being colorblind and to start being color
rich," Whitlock said. "Despite Enron, despite Osama bin Laden, despite
the Ku Klux Klan, despite the other entities that will preach hate, we
must learn to love each other despite our differences."</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock delivered a rousing sermon on "The Living Legacy of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr." before about 150 people, who normally worship in
a UC Irvine lecture hall. The service included performances by a
20-member band and choir, whose hand-clapping and swelling voices made it
seem much larger.</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock reminded the congregation--Irvine's oldest and largest black
church--of the sacrifices that King made and the tools that he used to
further his message--song, suffering, service and "good soil" (faith and
belief in God).</TE>
<TE>   He peppered the sermon with quotes from King: "Darkness cannot drive
out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only
love can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock closed his remarks with a slide and audio presentation that
included photos of King along with excerpts of his speeches and music.</TE>
<TE>   It moved Frank Barner, 55, of Tustin to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking of all the things I've personally been through,"
Barner said. "It just caught me, and I felt very full. It's just very
emotional for me."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on King's legacy, Barner said, "There's so many things we
would not have."</TE>
<TE>   Barner recalled when he first moved to Orange County in 1973 and was
searching for a place to live. He called apartment complexes, and
managers would say there was space available.</TE>
<TE>   But when he arrived to fill out an application, the managers would
tell him they had no vacancy. "We have a lot to be thankful for," Barner
said. "We've come a long, long way."</TE>
<TE>   In a scholarship luncheon after the service, about 250 people gathered
to recognize Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona as "Man of the Year" and
UC Irvine student Tenisha Powers, winner of a church-sponsored essay
contest entitled "A Vision Beyond a Crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Powers wrote that King's teachings are particularly relevant as
suspicions and hate crimes rose against people of Arabic descent after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third year the church has handed out scholarships. Last
year, it awarded $5,000. This year, church officials hope the amount will
grow to $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby McDonald, president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Orange
County, said the chamber, the church and the Newport-Mesa-Irvine
Interfaith Council sponsored the event to increase public awareness of
King and to show that today's holiday is for everyone, not just African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "His promissory note was for all--life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness for everyone," McDonald said.</TE>

<TE>   The companies' sod stories are intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Green Sod, as it was initially known, was first to get off the
ground. It was founded in 1968 by Gramckow's father, Werner, a West
German immigrant who studied accounting at UCLA and landed a job in 1960
with Cal-Turf in Camarillo, a West Coast pioneer in turf growing.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, when the elder Gramckow decided to strike out on his own,
he enlisted his son--by then a Stanford graduate with an engineering
degree--and leased 100 acres from Tom Davis, a rancher whose family had
been in Ventura County for generations and farmed thousands of acres on
the Oxnard Plain.</TE>
<TE>   Davis died in 1974, leaving the land to his family, including his
daughter, Beth. Two years later, diverging grass-growing philosophies
prompted the Gramckows to again set out on their own, this time to start
Southland Sod.</TE>
<TE>   That left Pacific Sod in the hands of Beth Davis, who in 1978 married
Richard Rogers. The couple co-own the business, although Richard oversees
most farm operations while Beth has been busy lately running for the seat
held by Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, whose district includes portions of
western Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>Farms Respected in Turf Industry</TE>
<TE>   The two companies exist now as cordial competitors, separated by only
a few miles on the flats that stretch between Oxnard and Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Southland is the bigger of the two in Southern California in terms of
acreage. But Pacific is bigger overall, farming about 2,000 acres at five
farms from Patterson in Stanislaus County to Indio in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Turf-grass experts say both sod farms are well respected and have
helped California become an industry leader.</TE>
<TE>   The state's sod producers farm an estimated 12,000 acres. In 1997, the
most recent year for which statistics are available, California was
second only to Florida in turf-grass sales, with the state's sod
companies generating more than $124 million in revenues that year.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Southland and Pacific] have extremely good reputations," said
Doug Fender, executive director of the 1,200-member Turfgrass Producers
International, a Chicago-based trade association. "They are definitely
among the leaders in the industry. And they've done a wonderful job
building a name for themselves and their products."</TE>
<TE>   It's possible, some in the grass-growing business say, that the
industry has hit its peak. A general slowdown in construction, a shift to
smaller lot sizes and concerns about water availability have all taken a
bite out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the rapid growth years are behind us," Gramckow said. "I
would characterize this as a mature industry. I don't see any great boom,
nor are we going to see any bust."</TE>
<TE>   On the rutted roads that crisscross Pacific Earth's sod fields, a
steadier pace is just fine with Richard Rogers. He said there was a time
when he thought it important to be the biggest sod producer. Now he just
wants to be one of the best.</TE>
<TE>   That is why workers go through 16 steps--from laser-leveling the
ground to turning on the water--to prepare seed beds for planting. It's
why he has hundreds of sod tests running at any one time, measuring
everything from water intake to weed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   And it's why he has poured more than $1 million into a
state-of-the-art computer system that catalogs orders and tracks
deliveries in real time.</TE>
<TE>Putting Down Roots for Future Growth</TE>
<TE>   The company has 12,000 active customers and last year completed more
than 80,000 deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized early on that if you took modern business practices and
applied them to what is essentially a farming operation, we could make
this company grow," Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are doing something like this, you have the opportunity to
make your own market."</TE>
<TE>   He's not finished yet.</TE>
<TE>   As Rogers eases a company minivan along narrow dirt roads, the
vehicle's tires crunch to a stop at the edge of a tarp-covered field.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plastic, a carpet of wildflowers is growing--a ground cover
pioneered by Pacific Earth. Nearby, another Pacific invention is taking
root in the form of grass grown hydroponically in a special planting mix,
made up of recycled organic material infused with nutrients, laid out on
sheets of plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Because the roots are never cut, Rogers explains, this is the
highest-quality grass the company grows and is a favorite of high-end
hotels and Hollywood set designers. But he said he is just as satisfied
when he is providing green space to parks, ball fields and backyards.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the industry has a lot of future," said Rogers, who left the
money-management business to watch the grass grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Our business here is improving people's lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a wonderful feeling when I know it's going to go to a place
that by definition will provide great comfort and joy."</TE>

<HD>1,000 Dogs Put Their Best Paws Forward at Ventura Show</HD>
<DH>Breeding: Proud owners show off their pampered pooches. But a Welsh
terrier named Bruhils Sea-Aire Carsey trots off with the top prize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Freshly brushed and powdered, Busy looked like a champion as she
gently hopped into a performance ring Sunday at the Ventura County Dog
Fanciers' competition in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   It was only 9:30 a.m. and the black-and-white Shetland sheep dog,
commonly known as a sheltie, had already spent 20 minutes being groomed
and fed by a team of handlers.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the primping wasn't enough to make Busy a winner.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 dogs competed in the show, held in two exhibition halls
at Seaside Park, but only seven qualified for the finals and a shot at
the Best in Show ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Busy was just too much girl [too large] for the judge," said
Gayle Eads, a member of the Santiago Shetland Sheepdogs Club, which
brought Busy and 10 other shelties to the show.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of judging, a Welsh terrier named Bruhils Sea-Aire Carsey
was awarded Best in Show.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's show was the first of two scheduled this year at the park.</TE>
<TE>   The next show will take place during the Fourth of July holiday and
feature more than 3,000 dogs.</TE>
<TE>   For many of 2,000 people who attended the free show, the day was an
opportunity to view dogs of all shapes and sizes, and browse vending
booths that offered everything from silver-plated water bowls to dog
sweaters and chew toys. "I'm with friends and my dogs. They give me
something to live for," said Pamela Encell of Ventura, a member of the
sheep dog club.</TE>
<TE>   Cendy McVoy, Encell's friend and training partner, said there is
personal sacrifice involved in dog breeding--long hours and lost
weekends--but the hobby can be satisfying. "It's become the main part of
my life. It gives me a sense of fulfillment and a sense of
accomplishment," said McVoy, a fast-food worker from San Bernardino who
has competed at dog shows for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   The county Dog Fanciers group has hosted the show for 36 years. The
events are sanctioned by the American Kennel Club and have grown in
popularity over the years, said Dog Fanciers Chairman Al Weinraub. "It
can start as a hobby to keep your family involved in doing something
together, but you become dedicated to creating better animals," said
Weinraub, who has trained Afghan hounds for nearly 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The show is designed to appeal to casual hobbyists and serious
competitors--many of whom spend thousands of dollars buying and breeding
each dog.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how much money and time are invested in a dog, the
judging is serious business.</TE>
<TE>   With a careful eye, Sandra Wheat, the sheltie judge at Sunday's show,
watched Busy and 30 other shelties being led around a 45-foot show ring.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs pranced proudly as their handlers strode next to them with
expressions of determination.</TE>
<TE>   In the sheltie division, Wheat gave top honors to a furry number named
Cas from San Jacinto.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more exotic and rare breeds was the komondor, which has
hair resembling dreadlocks.</TE>

<KH>IN BRIEF / THOUSAND OAKS</KH>
<HD>Officials Seek to Halt Cutting of 40 Oak Trees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two City Council members will ask colleagues Tuesday to support
their effort to halt the cutting of 40 oak trees scheduled to make way
for the Lang Ranch dam.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Ed Masry and Councilwoman Linda Parks want to direct the Ventura
County Flood Control District to delay the cutting--slated for late
January or early February--until the county receives all the permits it
needs to begin building the dam.</LD>
<LD>   The county expects to break ground this spring, but a permit from the
state Division of Safety of Dams hasn't been received. Flood control
officials planned to cut the trees a few months before bird nesting
season. Masry and Parks, both critics of the dam project, argue that the
oaks could die in vain if the final dam permit is not granted. Flood
officials say the dam is needed to protect homeowners and habitat
downstream in the event of a 100-year storm.</LD>

<HD>Helping Ojai Celebrate Diversity</HD>
<DH>Community: Troy Barner uses background as an African American from
Inglewood to foster understanding and dispel stereotypes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As one of the few black men living in Ojai, Troy Barner sometimes
feels like an ambassador for an entire race and sometimes a mere token.</LD>
<LD>   Neither is true, but the mere perception can be exhausting.</LD>
<LD>   "I get constant attention. I sort of represent African Americans to a
lot of people here," said the tall, well-dressed Barner, who is producing
this year's Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Ojai. "I do want
people to see my color. It would be an insult if they didn't see me as a
black man."</LD>
<TE>   While Ojai has an abundance of natural beauty and eclectic lifestyles,
it lacks much in the way of ethnic diversity. The latest census figures
show the city of 7,862 has only about 50 black residents.</TE>
<TE>   So Barner, 32, knew he was entering a different world.</TE>
<TE>   Originally from Inglewood, he moved to the area almost two years ago
to take a job as a program director for the Ojai Valley Youth Foundation.
One of his tasks is training students how to appreciate diversity among
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But he was initially worried how people would treat him.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of blacks would have ruled out a place like this, but I wanted
to give Ojai a chance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His first test was renting an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some anxiety, but the landlady was really nice and has become a
good friend of mine," he said. "I moved in and wanted to go for a walk. I
expected something to happen. I was nervous, but people talked to me and
I feel at home now."</TE>
<TE>   Barner is a relaxed, soft-spoken man with a ready sense of humor. He
doesn't take offense easily, which is just as well given that during his
time in Ojai, people have assumed he is an ace basketball player, a fan
of rap music and a rough homeboy from a violent neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The assumptions can be annoying.</TE>
<TE>   "People will find something that doesn't quite work well and they will
say 'Oh man, that is so ghetto,' and I say, 'Man, what do you know about
the ghetto?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barner grew up as one of three children. One of his brothers was
developmentally disabled and later died. He barely knew his father. His
mother raised the children largely on public assistance after she was
injured on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Barner returns to Inglewood when he needs a "fix" of black culture. On
Sundays, he sings in the choir at St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Santa Barbara. Every time he walks into the church or through
the streets of Inglewood, he breathes a bit easier.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to always set a good example can be exhausting, and he
often feels as if he represents all black people in the eyes of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "I sometimes feel like an ambassador," he said. "The fact that I live
here and do the kind of work I do and that I'm a black man is
significant. If you look at the statistics, black men aren't faring too
well in this country. With me, people here can interact with a black man
in a positive way. There is a feeling sometimes that you are a token, but
I try to get over that."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie Nixon Bohnett, associate director of the foundation, hired
Barner. He previously organized conferences at Westmont College in Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "He's introverted and artistic and uses that sensitivity well," said
Bohnett.</TE>
<TE>   She said his ethnicity benefits the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very helpful because so much of our work is about
diversity," she said. "Troy's sensitivity about being black in Ojai helps
bring that to the surface, and he can talk about himself as a human
being. I think his young life is very much an open book. He jumps right
in and relates well to young people."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Grier held Barner's job before he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's really courageous of him as a black man to come into a
white community and do the things he's doing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Barner coordinates three projects, supervises high school volunteers
and is a member of the foundation's management team.</TE>
<TE>   He was recently telling one young staffer about his fear of being
pulled over by a potentially racist police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "A mistake on a black man's part will cost him much more than a
mistake by a white man," he told the 17-year-old, who nodded.</TE>
<TE>   The Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
at Libbey Park and Chaparral Continuation High School.</TE>
<TE>   It will include theater productions, African drumming, live music,
student essay and art contests and speakers on multiculturalism from UC
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "Martin Luther King's great goal was to set African Americans free in
this society," Barner said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a right to be in this country and part of this society and to
live where we want--like in Ojai."</TE>

<LD>Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, welcoming Steve Spurrier
to town as the new Redskin coach, had this to say:</LD>
<LD>  "You're Steve Spurrier and it's great to be you.</LD>
<LD>  "You're like Mick Jagger was 30 years ago--when it was still great to
be Mick Jagger. (Not like now, when he's an old coot who's beginning to
look like a gargoyle.)"</LD>
<TE>  And more Kornheiser:</TE>
<TE>  "The owner in Washington doesn't have a quarterback worthy of
Spurrier's spit, and his most reputed wide receiver has been seven years
worth of disappointment. But he hired Spurrier in a heartbeat. (It's like
signing Tom Cruise to star in your movie, and only \o7 afterward\f7
writing a script.)"</TE>

Olympics: "We want to show that Utah is more than Karl Malone, beautiful
mountains and some guy with five wives and 26 kids."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Looking back: Chicago Tribune columnist Phil Rogers, on the sorry state
of baseball in the Windy City:</TE>
<TE>  "It has been 42 seasons since either the White Sox or the Cubs went to
the World Series, and 84 since either of them won a series championship.
Heck, we've thrown one since we've won one."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Ouch! Political comedian Mark Russell suggests that Houston change the
name of Enron Field to Leavenworth Park.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Daytona time: From the Sporting News' Caught on the Fly column:</TE>
<TE>  "Fly put ear to pavement and found out thisquick that another season of
paint trading is barreling around turn 2 [four weeks and countin',
lugnuts]. Boffo competition, cocoon-like protection and genuine, ahem,
dislike for one another have drivers ready to bump and NASCAR honchos
starting to suh-weat when Jeffy Gordon says, 'If they rub me the wrong
way, I'm going to rub them right back.'</TE>
<TE>  "And how does that rub you, Robby Gordon and Tony Stewart?"</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Enough said: Ozzie Smith, newly elected to baseball's Hall of Fame,
spent much of his time after retirement playing golf.</TE>
<TE>  "People ask me what my handicap is, and I say it's golf," he said.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Politically incorrect: The Denver team in the new United Women's
Football League will be known as the Foxes.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The boss talks: Former Formula One champion Niki Lauda, 52, unhappy
with the way his Jaguar team performed last year, says he will test the
2002 model himself before the season starts.</TE>
<TE>  Said team driver Pedro de la Rosa: "I'll be very disappointed if he
beats me. He hasn't driven an F1 car for 16 years and his stomach is
getting bigger."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Trivia answer: Three--Mark Madsen, San Ramon Valley; Jelani McCoy, San
Diego St. Augustine; and Brian Shaw, Oakland Bishop O'Dowd.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  And finally: According to Drew Sharp, Detroit Free Press columnist,
"Bud Selig's credibility is dropping as fast as Enron stock, his word
holding about as much value. He's the mouthpiece for a multibillionaire
fraternity determined to drive the game into the graveyard, and the
commissioner's role is to navigate from behind the steering wheel."</TE>

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,
worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>\f7    What: "Picture Perfect: the Stories Behind the Greatest
Photographs in Sports"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</LD>
<TE>   Photography was invented in 1839 and the first action shot came after
California Gov. Leland Stanford commissioned a photographer to shoot a
horse while galloping to determine if all four legs were off the ground
at once. The photo showed that they were.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Age of sports photography came much later, during the
1940s, '50s and '60s. HBO, in this one-hour documentary, explores that
era and the influence of still images in sports history.</TE>
<TE>   This is a great show. You might say it is picture perfect. It will
surely earn more awards for HBO Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many photographs highlighted is one taken by Associated
Press photographer Nat Fein of Babe Ruth's final appearance at Yankee
Stadium in 1948, four months before he died.</TE>
<TE>   Fein, who is still alive, talks about the photo and why he chose to
shoot Ruth from behind. Also included in this segment is an interview
with Ralph Norse, a Life magazine photographer who shot the event in
color. Norse's photos were never used because, after the two weeks it
took to develop the prints, Fein's black-and-white photo had been printed
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more interesting stories involves the classic photo of Y.A.
Tittle, where he is bloodied and on his knees after his helmet was
knocked off following an interception that led to a touchdown that
enabled the Pittsburgh Steelers to defeat the New York Giants in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Berman took the photo for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, but the
newspaper never printed it. According to Berman, the sports editor
complained because there was no action in the shot. Berman saved the
photo and began winning awards with it. A blowup hangs in the NFL Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio, and it is considered possibly the greatest sports
photo of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked 51 years in the business and that was my chance to win a
Pulitzer, but the photo was ineligible because it wasn't printed,"
laments Berman.</TE>
<TE>   Tittle is also interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the other featured photos and stories include Ben Hogan at the
1950 U.S. Open, Notre Dame's "Four Horsemen," Mary Decker being tripped
by Zola Budd at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Bob Beamon's
record-breaking long jump and Chuck Bednarik's hit on Frank Gifford.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Weekend observations, quips, musings and pinpricks while trying to
maintain a resting heart rate suitable for a possible tryout on ABC's
"The Chair."</LD>
<LD>   News item: New England defeats Oakland, 16-13, on a controversial
instant replay reversal.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Sorry, but tennis star-turned-quiz master John McEnroe
says I can NOT discuss this issue until my heart slows to below the 200
beats per minute it has maintained since NFL refs ruled New England
quarterback Tom Brady did not fumble when hit by Raider cornerback
Charles Woodson.</LD>
<TE>   News item: Brady says in postgame interview "I knew I was throwing the
ball."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Let's send Brady straight to McEnroe's chair and see
if his ticker sticks to that story.</TE>
<TE>   If you were not convinced Brady fumbled, you ought to obtain a
transcript of the Channel 2 postgame show Saturday night that offered
compelling and unbiased analysis from Rod Martin (former Raider), Willie
Gault (former Raider), Steve Hartman (former Raider employee) and Jim
Hill (wishes he was a Raider).</TE>
<TE>   Inside scuttlebutt: Rumor has it former Pittsburgh Steeler running
back Franco Harris is telling friends he thought the call was "immaculate
and dead-on."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Reached by the Boston Globe, Ben Dreith says of the Brady
play, "That was a fumble!"</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Background: Dreith was the NFL stripe who called New
England defensive end Ray Hamilton for roughing Oakland quarterback Ken
Stabler in a 1976 playoff game. That "iffy" call helped Oakland rally to
victory. Patriot fans would simply argue Saturday night was payback for
that injustice 25 seasons ago and proves the NFL has not always conspired
against the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Bill Parcells rejects lucrative offer to coach Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Tampa Bay's decade-old pursuit of the "Big Tuna" has
to be the most exasperating tough-luck fishing story since Santiago waged
war with a marlin in Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea."</TE>
<TE>   How many ways did Tampa Bay mess this up? The Buccaneers would not
have fired Tony Dungy had they known Parcells was going to bail out.
Also, in believing Parcells eventually would take the job, the Buccaneers
botched the chance to hire Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   At least in the Hemingway novel, Santiago walked away with his
dignity.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban (note seamless transition
from Hemingway reference) threatens to sell team if NBA Commissioner
David Stern punishes him by forcing franchise to forfeit draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: No, please, don't, say it isn't so. Next you're going
to tell us Dennis Rodman is threatening to leave Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Montreal Expos to play farewell season under control of
major league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: To address this unique situation, we've come up with
some lame-duck promotional ideas:</TE>
<TE>   May 15: Take a Seat Day. Every fan with a ticket gets to remove his
seat and keep it. Club will provide screwdrivers.</TE>
<TE>   June 13: Adhesive Tape Day. Fans get one free ticket for each roll of
medical tape they provide to team's training staff in an effort to keep
costs down.</TE>
<TE>   July 4: Curse Bud Selig in French Day.</TE>
<TE>   Sept 30: Fan (Singular) Appreciation Day. Lone spectator attending
last game gets to eat a box lunch on home plate.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Expos may end up moving to Washington D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Early, off-the-cuff potential nicknames for the D.C.
franchise: Lobbyists, Enrons, Domers, Interns, Phillybusters,
Mem-Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   A quick baseball-in-Washington recap: The Washington Senators played
in the nation's capital from 1901 to 1960 before moving to Minnesota. The
"new" Senators were a 1961 expansion franchise and played in Washington
through 1971 before relocating to become the Texas Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Senator trivia, fact and fiction: It is true President William Howard
Taft threw out the first ball at a Senator game in 1910. It is not true
Strom Thurmond tossed out the first ball in 1901.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. senator from South Carolina wasn't born until 1902.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Duke beats Maryland in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: ESPN has no regrets about televising a game that
tipped off at 9:15 p.m. on the East Coast, although announcer Dick Vitale
was almost fined $500 for violating Durham's noise abatement laws.</TE>
<TE>   News item: UCLA football Coach Bob Toledo awards himself a one-year
contract extension through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: They're technically calling this a rollover, which is
sort of what last year's Bruins did after a 6-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   News item: UCLA basketball team blows 20-point second-half lead and
loses at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Toledo tells Steve Lavin this may be a good time to
roll over his contract.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Washington Redskins introduce Steve Spurrier as new coach.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You have to be pulling for Spurrier if only so he can
debunk this work-till-you-drop NFL coaching mentality. In winning 122
games in 12 years at Florida, Spurrier managed to squeeze in 60 to 90
rounds of golf in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier is traipsing on hallowed ground here given that Joe Gibbs,
who led Washington to three Super Bowls titles, was a textbook workaholic
who slept on a cot in his office during the week.</TE>
<TE>   News item: McEnroe takes on challenge as host of ABC's "The Chair."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Sadly, Ivan Lendl's idea for a show called "The End
Table" is rejected.</TE>
<TE>   News item: UCLA and USC women mix it up during Pacific 10 basketball
game.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I just knew someday Title IX would lead to a title
fight.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Dodgers trade Gary Sheffield to Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Charter members of "Piazza Had To Go" fan club gather
in phone booth near Tommy's to discuss strategy.</TE>

<HD>Enron Case Raises the Bar in Texas</HD>
<DH>A matter that's big even by the state's usual standards has the
legal community in a frenzy, with lawyers hiring their own lawyers and
others dodging conflicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Even the lawyers here are hiring lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   The astounding collapse of Enron Corp. has devastated employees,
infuriated shareholders, stung creditors and awakened the regulators.
Everyone's upset. And everyone's headed for court.</LD>
<LD>   "This case is the full employment act for Texas lawyers," said Richard
J. Zook, who was the first to file a class-action lawsuit against the
energy company, now operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   "There will be civil lawyers, criminal lawyers, securities lawyers,
regulatory lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers, employment benefits lawyers and
trial lawyers," Zook said. "Billions and billions have been lost. It's
going be a long, detailed and exhaustive search for the guilty parties."</TE>
<TE>   So far, 51 lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court here naming
former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as a defendant.
Fifty-six go after former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling.
Fifty-three seek damages from Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Dozens more suits
go after the company itself.</TE>
<TE>   That's not all. Lawyers for Enron's 20,000 creditors are seeking
restitution, and a group of Enron bondholders is suing the company's
former auditor, Andersen, as well as the bonds' underwriters.</TE>
<TE>   Samson Investment Co., an oil exploration company that was an Enron
partner, sued the auditor last week. Enron itself is making noises about
suing Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen. Other lawyers are
focusing on the brokers who touted Enron's once-golden stock. Wendy
Gramm, an Enron board member and the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas),
has had 14 suits filed against her.</TE>
<TE>   Texans are fond of their superlatives, so few here are resisting the
notion that the biggest bankruptcy filing of all time will spur the
largest legal quagmire of all time. Yet that opinion is seconded by more
distant observers, who nonetheless caution that the case is still
unfolding.</TE>
<TE>Resolution in Courts Likely Will Take Years</TE>
<TE>   "This involves civil actions as well as potentially criminal ones,
private as well as public entities," said Stanford University law
professor Deborah Hensler. "And it involves lots of money and has lots of
political ramifications. Those are the ingredients you'd need."</TE>
<TE>   The legal actions are likely to go on awhile.</TE>
<TE>   Given the number of defendants and legal proceedings and "the
potential of the criminal cases to delay the civil cases," said San Diego
lawyer William Lerach, "it will take as many as six years to resolve
this."</TE>
<TE>   Lerach, who represents shareholders who claim they lost fortunes
because of Enron's deception, rejects assertions that the only winners
will be lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawyers always do well whenever there's a disaster," he said. But he
added that class-action lawyers "only get paid if they make a recovery
for the class--and they only get paid a percentage of what they recover."</TE>
<TE>   All the more reason, then, to spread the legal net as wide as
possible. The juiciest target could be Andersen, which stands accused of
failing to present Enron's true financial picture. The Chicago-based
company has deep pockets and, unlike Enron, is not shielded by U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Isgur, a Houston bankruptcy lawyer, estimated that at least 40
Houston firms were involved in the case. Others, like Isgur himself, were
talking to potential clients.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone that touched Enron is going to need legal advice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Enron lawsuits are being launched all over the country--the
bankruptcy case is being heard in New York, and the Samson complaint was
filed in Tulsa, Okla.--by far the greatest concentration is here, in the
energy company's hometown.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are so plentiful that questions are starting to be asked
about conflicts of interest, and the lawyers themselves are wondering
what their own best interests are. Sooner or later, everyone is going to
have to take sides.</TE>
<TE>   In the good old days, there was only one side for Houston lawyers.
Everyone sat on charity boards with Chairman Lay, shopped at the
Galleria, lived in swank River Oaks and dined on the truffle-scented baby
hen at Tony's.</TE>
<TE>   "The royalty of Houston were either Enron bosses or on the board of
Enron," said Gerald Treece, associate dean at South Texas College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   The tight relationships--and Enron's big footprint in this town--are
leading to conflicts. Two of the 18 U.S. District Court judges here,
Nancy Atlas and David Hittner, had to recuse themselves from Enron cases.
An Atlas assistant said the judge would not comment; an assistant to
Hittner said his decision was prompted by his ownership of Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   Their cases were assigned to U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal, who
disclosed last month that she had "long-standing friendships" with two
defense lawyers. One of former CFO Fastow's lawyers was godfather to one
of Rosenthal's children, the judge said in a court filing. Another lawyer
representing Enron defendants was best man at Rosenthal's wedding. The
judge said she was "fully capable of disregarding these relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago, without explanation, Rosenthal recused herself from her
46 Enron cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is Enron is everywhere and Enron executives are
everywhere," said Elizabeth Freeman, a lawyer for Enron creditors. "Most
of the judges were practitioners here. They might have represented Enron
or an Enron competitor."</TE>
<TE>Cases Consolidated Into 3 Categories</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring that point, the U.S. attorney's office in Houston, which
was conducting a criminal investigation of Enron, was recused from the
case Jan. 9 by the Justice Department, in part because staffers are
related to Enron employees.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, U.S. Atty. Mike Shelby's brother-in-law worked for the
energy company. Because many Enron employees are bitter over the collapse
of their company savings plans, there was the possibility the government
lawyers would be accused of seeking vengeance instead of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Although the number of lawyers is multiplying, the number of active
cases is shrinking for the moment. That's because they are being
consolidated on three tracks: employee benefits, shareholder class
actions and so-called derivative suits, in which shareholders sue a
corporation's officers to force them to restore to the company money they
allegedly stole from it. The docket sheet for the class-action suit Newby
et al vs. Enron Corp. takes 15 pages to list all the lawyers involved.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of the frantic legal activity, there's a sense that this
might only be the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't gone to Defcon 1 yet," said Treece, the law school dean.
"When Enron filed for bankruptcy, it scared a lot of lawyers away. They
thought the chance of getting big money evaporated."</TE>
<TE>   Some have a different reason for staying away.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about Texans, they think loyalty means something," Treece
said.</TE>
<TE>   By spreading its work around, Enron bought a lot of loyalty in the
Texas legal world. This is a trick the law firms seem to have learned
themselves. When Vinson &amp; Elkins, Enron's main law firm, was named as a
defendant in two of the class-action lawsuits, it promptly sought out
Joseph Jamail, the most famous litigator in Texas, to represent it.</TE>
<TE>   Jamail won a $10.5-billion verdict in 1985 against Texaco for his
client Pennzoil, a case that was the previous high-water mark for Texas
litigators. He did not return a call to comment, but anyone expecting him
to take on Enron in similar fashion is likely to be disappointed.</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Yields Lessons for Pentagon's Next Targets</HD>
<DH>Military: Strategists study the campaign's successes and failures
with eyes on new fronts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Like most Northern Alliance generals, Abdul Rashid Dostum's
experience with Russian bombers during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in the 1980s left him skeptical about calling for help from the air. You
never knew when--or even where--the bombs would hit.</LD>
<LD>   But on Nov. 8, he had no choice. It had been days since his rebels won
their first victory in Mazar-i-Sharif, and he was watching Al Qaeda
fighters amassing to retake the northern city of Kunduz.</LD>
<LD>   "We need some air," he told a young U.S. Air Force special operations
lieutenant.</LD>
<TE>   Within 20 minutes, the eyes of Afghanistan's most feared warlord
widened as a succession of fireballs erupted over an expanse the size of
a football field, killing 259 Al Qaeda fighters and taking out a command
center, artillery and armored vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be kidding," Dostum said. He hadn't expected the strike
for a day or more.</TE>
<TE>   Such a precise, rapid air assault could not have occurred in any
previous war. And not just because of the technology.</TE>
<TE>   The episode encapsulates much of what went right for the coalition
forces in Afghanistan, a combination of factors that had never been
pulled together successfully before. This included a unique,
on-the-ground collaboration between Americans and a disparate,
half-trained collection of local fighters; nearly seamless ground-air
teamwork, thanks in part to the debut of a laser range finder that let
the troops below direct pilots to their targets; and an assortment of
"smart" bombs and rejiggered "dumb" bombs that turned even the ungainly
B-52 bomber into a virtual attack fighter.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the tale is one of the success stories combat commanders have
sent to the desk of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who will decide
how the lessons of the Afghan war could be used on future fronts in the
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   They will be balanced against the apparent failures--foremost, the
escapes of hundreds or thousands of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters due to
the willingness of some members of the proxy army to look the other way.
There were civilian casualties of the U.S. bombing, as in every war,
touching off a fierce debate within the Pentagon over whether the
military was reckless or actually so obsessed with avoiding "collateral
damage" that it missed targets and prolonged the war. And there was the
decision to make airlifted food rations the same color as cluster bombs.</TE>
<TE>   All of it is being sifted for guidance on how and where to proceed
next in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Somalia and Iraq, for example, offer the tantalizing prospect of
enabling the Pentagon to reprise a combination of U.S. air power and
proxy forces on the ground. Pentagon planners, fearful of reliving a
failed 1993 mission in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and one was
dragged through the streets, are considering using Ethiopian rebels to
help engage suspected Al Qaeda sites in the vast ungovernable expanses of
Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   The proxy strategy that gave Dostum access to a B-52 bomber was
ill-formed when the campaign began. Defense officials feared the Northern
Alliance could not keep up with the pace of U.S. air gains, and
disaffected southern Pushtuns would refuse to raise arms against their
ethnic tribesmen in a ground war led by northern ethnic rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't really totally thought out that they were going to become a
surrogate army," said a senior Air Force official involved in crafting
the campaign. "The strategy evolved as it came along. The idea of using
the Northern Alliance as surrogates was always there, but the confidence
level of whether they could do it wasn't always assured."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy has its shortcomings. For one thing, local forces don't
always have the same agenda. More than once, Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar has been reported to have negotiated a surrender with
anti-Taliban forces only to escape. Some Pentagon officials have
speculated that Afghan allies on the ground, more interested in control
than capture, simply looked the other way as Omar and others fled.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, the presumed proxy army would be the anti-government Kurds,
who have spent much of their time fighting among themselves and lack the
military might mustered by the Northern Alliance. The State Department
recently rescinded funding for one major anti-government group, the Iraqi
National Congress, over financial mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   "The model sort of falls apart," said Michele Fluornoy, a military
analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and author
of "To Prevail," a book on the anti-terrorism campaign. "I don't think we
can contemplate the use of the model in Iraq without the use of ground
forces on a major scale."</TE>
<TE>A Proving Ground for Alliances, Weapons</TE>
<TE>   Then again, in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance was initially
ridiculed by some western military analysts. The Americans learned a
great deal about harnessing the strengths of imperfect indigenous
fighters. Hawks note that the Kurds weren't effectively used in the
Persian Gulf War campaign and argue that they could prove useful in a war
to topple Saddam Hussein's military machine, with its weapons of mass
destruction and an army that far outnumbers the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan war also became a proving ground for a wide range of
technology. Early on, for example, a debate raged over the usefulness of
unmanned bombers, pilotless surveillance craft that had never before been
fitted with bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's over," Fluornoy said. "We know it's incredibly useful. They
allowed us to get very close to take out time-sensitive targets without
risking American lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Gulf War was known for introducing precision-guided bombs, but
only 1 in 10 explosives dropped by U.S. warplanes in that war was
"smart," compared with 2 out of 3 in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The "smart" CBU-103 cluster bomb Dostum saw in Kunduz also got its
first battle testing in Afghanistan. It is simply the "dumb" version of a
bomb used in the Gulf and Kosovo wars, fitted with course-correcting tail
fins. The tail device corrects the drift of the bomb canister even in
high winds and determines the proper location for the bomblets to
disperse. Because they were delivered from more than 15,000 feet, strong
winds tended to blow them off course.</TE>
<TE>   Cluster bombs are designed to disperse in the air to maximize the
damage to large groups of soldiers or equipment. The type used in
Afghanistan breaks into 202 soda can-sized bomblets.</TE>
<TE>   After testing an updated model for two decades, the Pentagon is now
preparing to deploy a smarter cluster bomb, the senior Air Force official
said. The new "sensor-fused" weapon uses fewer, more powerful bomblets
and is designed to strike large vehicles and troop concentrations. What
make it smarter are a parachute and a heat-seeking mechanism that allows
it to literally follow tanks and other moving targets. In early versions,
the first bomblet to reach its target set off the others, causing a
string of explosions but striking only the first target. New versions
have apparently corrected that problem.</TE>
<TE>Limits to Uses of Cluster Munitions</TE>
<TE>   The newest cluster munitions might be effective against lines of tanks
in Iraq but are too powerful to be used on small targets such as the
terrorist cells in Somalia or Yemen, military analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were worried about, say, half a million North Korean soldiers
lunging across the DMZ [demilitarized zone] or if you were worried about
Iraq trying to grab Kuwait while nobody was looking, then this certainly
would be a weapon of choice," said John Pike, a munitions expert at
Globalsecurity.org. "But not if you're talking about terrorist training
camps."</TE>
<TE>   In the "no kidding" category of lessons learned, top Pentagon
strategists privately acknowledge that it was a mistake to make the food
ration dropped by U.S. cargo planes the same color (yellow) as cluster
bombs. About 5% of cluster bomblets land unexploded. They later go off
with the touch of a hand, maiming or killing civilians who mistake them
for food.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, defense officials have said such confusion was not a problem
because the bombs were dropped among heavy troop concentrations, while
food rations have been dropped largely in the rural countryside. However,
civilians have been known to pick them up months after combatants have
cleared a battlefield. Three decades after American warplanes rained
cluster bombs near the Vietnamese border with Laos, reports of civilian
casualties persist. Most of the victims are children.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths of civilians, whether by unexploded ammunition or
misdirected bombs, are a lesson learned in every war. But the more
sophisticated the weaponry, the less chance of collateral damage,
military officials point out.</TE>
<TE>Smart Bomb Found to Be Highly Accurate</TE>
<TE>   Another smart bomb likely to be widely used in anti-terrorism strikes
is the Joint Direct Attack Munition. Military officials say they're
cheap, accurate and unaffected by weather. According to Air Force
figures, 85% of the weapons have destroyed their targets, and the
accuracy of individual bombs has exceeded the accuracy specified by the
manufacturer, Boeing Co., striking within 43 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, which was dropped 650 times in Kosovo, has struck Afghan
soil 4,600 times.</TE>
<TE>   Like smart cluster bombs, the JDAM merely adds a satellite-based
guidance system to "dumb" bombs--the Pentagon prefers the term "gravity"
bombs--as large as 2,000 pounds. They can be launched up to 15 miles from
the target and, compared to older precision bombs costing up to 10 times
as much, they're affordable. Under a 1995 contract, Lockheed Martin and
Boeing charged the Air Force about $18,000 per bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike pricier and more finicky laser-guided munitions, they can be
dropped in any weather. In Kosovo, Air Force officials complained that
persistent cloud cover often made laser-guided weapons useless. JDAMs use
the satellites of the Global Positioning System. Heavy bombers like the
B-1 and B-2 use GPS rather than laser guidance.</TE>
<TE>   For all those reasons, "the JDAM is the weapon of choice," Pike said.</TE>
<TE>   Smart bombs such as the JDAM have given new life to the B-52, which
first rolled off the Boeing assembly line in Seattle in 1951 to carry
nuclear warheads and ended production a decade later. Supporters of the
B-52 say it's only coincidence that the vintage bomber was used in both
"friendly fire" incidents in which U.S. bombs killed American soldiers
and Afghan allies in Mazar-i-Sharif and near Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents are still being investigated, but a senior Pentagon
official with knowledge of the air campaign said the errant strikes were
more likely because of the ground forces mistakenly calling in their own
coordinates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was human error, it sounds like, one way or another," he said.</TE>
<TE>CIA, Defense Dept. Find Ways to Cooperate</TE>
<TE>   The reviews on intelligence-gathering in Afghanistan have been mixed.
The bombing strikes became more devastating as ground spotters put their
eyes and lasers on pro-Taliban targets, Rumsfeld has said. One field
evaluation forwarded to the Pentagon cited a newfound "synergy" between
the CIA and the Department of Defense. CIA spotters and interrogators
worked alongside U.S. special operations troops to ferret out bombing
targets from Mazar-i-Sharif to the eastern caves and bunkers of Tora Bora
and Zhawar Kili.</TE>
<TE>   A cumbersome target-approval process that reportedly allowed Taliban
leader Omar literally to escape from the sights of U.S. forces was
smoothed out to the point where he would have been hit under the same
circumstances later in the campaign, Fluornoy said.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, the two cultures have clashed," she said of the CIA and
the Pentagon. "They've refused to share information. They've refused to
conduct operations jointly. This is really a cultural breakthrough."</TE>
<TE>   Yet human intelligence reports have proved unreliable, placing Omar
and accused terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden in various spots, often
at the same time. Some critics suggest that double-agent allies using
American satellite phones have deliberately pointed warplanes to civilian
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials have apparently had no luck infiltrating the Al
Qaeda network and argue that fundamentalist Muslim terrorism groups are
nearly impossible to penetrate. Yet critics note that John Walker Lindh,
the youthful Al Qaeda fighter from Marin County now charged with
conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to terrorists,
inveigled his way into Al Qaeda and met Bin Laden within two years.</TE>
<TE>   The war confirmed the widely held view that the U.S. intelligence
apparatus suffers by valuing technology over linguists and analysts, said
Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a retired military intelligence officer.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental lesson is that we don't do the human side well
enough," Peters said. "We have these networks of satellites and
electronics that cost literally . . . tens of billions of dollars each
year, and yet we'll pay the young person who's analyzing the data $25,000
a year. We need a much more balanced intelligence system."</TE>

<HD>Low-Key Daschle Leading Party Into a Pivotal Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Call him the unlikely gladiator.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Daschle is by acclamation one of the most likable, low-key members
of the U.S. Senate. He is chronically self-deprecating in a place riddled
with pomposity. Even in the middle of raucous debate, he speaks in tones
so soothing he could be reading a bedtime story. And even after years as
the Senate's Democratic leader, he was so little-known just a year ago
that he could do his own grocery shopping in Washington without
attracting much attention.</LD>
<LD>   No more. Daschle has emerged as the de facto leader of the Democratic
Party, catapulted into the political spotlight by circumstances that have
put him toe-to-toe with President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   His rise to prominence has been fueled by the animosity of his
adversaries. Republicans have mounted a full-dress campaign--scathing
political ads in South Dakota, television appearances by Daschle critics,
a new Web site created by conservative activists--to brand him an
obstructionist. Their message: Beneath his beguiling, soft-spoken veneer
lurks a hardened partisan.</TE>
<TE>   This much is certain--as Senate majority leader, Daschle has more
power than any other Democrat to counter Bush's domestic agenda. And to
the delight of many Democrats and the frustration of the GOP, he has used
it. Daschle has almost single-handedly blocked or slowed Bush's proposals
on energy policy, tax cuts and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of any higher form of flattery than the fact that the
Republicans have decided to put him in their cross hairs," said Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   Now, major challenges loom for Daschle as Congress reconvenes this
week. How he flexes his muscles in the coming year will be a key factor
in whether Bush can turn his wartime popularity into legislative success
on the domestic front. That, in turn, could determine which party
controls the Senate after the 2002 elections--and whether Daschle can
present himself as a credible challenger to Bush in the 2004 presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Daschle personifies the conundrum his party faces in
its relationship with Bush. He has struggled to balance his support for
the president's war on terrorism against growing efforts to fight Bush on
issues such as taxes and health policy that cut to the core of the
differences between the parties they head.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ticklish," said Peter Fenn, a Democratic political consultant.
"Everyone realizes that criticizing the president . . . is very
delicate."</TE>
<TE>   Also ticklish is the task of leading a divided party as Democrats
continue to grope for bearings in the post-Clinton era. That challenge
became clear following Daschle's much-publicized speech this month in
which he blamed much of the country's fiscal woes on the Bush-backed tax
cut--yet stopped short of calling for a repeal or rollback of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the 12 moderate Senate Democrats who voted for the tax cut
bridled at Daschle's intensified criticism of it. But some party liberals
thought he did not go far enough, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)
upped the ante in the tax cut debate by proposing changes to the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We are clearly in a transitional period," said Simon Rosenberg,
president of the New Democrats Network. "It still remains to be seen
who's going to define the next Democratic Party."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's relationship with Bush took on new significance and
visibility in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As part of his
effort to build a bipartisan war coalition, Bush began weekly breakfast
meetings with Daschle and the other congressional leaders. In his speech
to Congress shortly after the attacks, Bush greeted Daschle with a bear
hug on the floor of the House--a nationally televised moment that became
an emblem of the post-Sept. 11 rapprochement between the parties.</TE>
<TE>Relations Strained With Administration</TE>
<TE>   But that embrace may have obscured a relationship rife with tension
and rivalry. Last spring, Bush irked Daschle by launching a
campaign-style tour for his tax cut in South Dakota. Adding to the
irritation, the White House recruited GOP Rep. John Thune to run this
year against South Dakota's other Democratic senator, Tim Johnson, a
Daschle protege.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Daschle annoyed the administration in July when he
bluntly criticized Bush's foreign policy just as the president was
launching a trip abroad.</TE>
<TE>   And last fall, Daschle moved decisively to block Bush's proposal to
open a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil
drilling. When the drilling plan appeared to have the votes needed to
pass the Senate Energy Committee, Daschle snatched the bill away from the
panel and said he would bring a leadership-backed bill to the Senate
floor--but not for months.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's political aides have always viewed Daschle with suspicion. They
see him in the mold of his mentor, former Senate Majority Leader George
J. Mitchell (D-Maine), who made legislative life miserable for the
administration of Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   That suspicion festered when Bush and Daschle faced off in a pitched
year-end battle over legislation to stimulate the economy. The battle,
which ended in a stalemate, laid bare a political reality unchanged by
Sept. 11: Daschle and Bush are fundamentally at odds over key elements of
domestic policy.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself has never attacked Daschle by name. He even put his arm
around him at one of the White House breakfasts and tried to distance
himself from the anti-Daschle ads running in South Dakota, according to a
Daschle confidant.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the GOP onslaught seems to be getting under Daschle's skin.
"You have to go back a long way to find a situation where a presidential
administration and Republicans have so aggressively and in such an
organized fashion attacked the leader of another party," Daschle said in
a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP campaign is reminiscent of the Democratic effort in the
mid-1990s to depict then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as the
personification of controversial elements of the Republican agenda. But
analysts in both parties say it will likely prove hard to demonize
Daschle, who lacks Gingrich's abrasiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been able to come across as a sensible centrist," said
Marshall Wittmann, a conservative analyst at the Hudson Institute. "The
problem for Republicans is that Daschle by temperament is not a
polarizing figure."</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are right that behind Daschle's mild manner exists a
tough, determined side that he displays not only in fighting GOP
initiatives, but occasionally to other Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   When Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) joined Republicans as a sponsor of
Bush's tax cut bill last year, a blindsided Daschle summoned him to his
office for a scolding. When Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) cut a deal and
threw his support behind the tax bill, Daschle responded sternly. "He
laid it on heavy," said a source familiar with the call.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Daschle shy about helping South Dakota, a conservative state
where his attention to local interests has given him a secure political
base despite his liberal leanings. Just recently, he helped muscle into a
year-end spending bill a provision to help turn an abandoned South Dakota
gold mine into an underground science lab.</TE>
<TE>Run for White House Could Be in the Cards</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's heightened profile was most evident by the attention
generated by the speech in which he lambasted Bush's economic policy,
arguing that the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut enacted last year was
the principal reason why the federal budget surplus has vanished, and
that it probably worsened the recession.</TE>
<TE>   It was a speech welcomed by many Democrats, who fear the party has
been too wary of engaging Bush in fights on domestic policy.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle came under fire for offering an analysis of fiscal
problems without endorsing a possible solution, such as rolling back or
delaying the tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   And even some Democrats questioned the political wisdom of the speech,
given that the tax cut issue so deeply divides his own party. Some also
argued that the public cares more about restoring the economy than about
assigning political blame for the loss of the surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "People . . . are more concerned about the future than the past," said
one House Democratic leadership aide.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans viewed the speech as a clear sign of Daschle's
presidential ambitions. When asked, Daschle does not rule out running for
president, but insists he has not focused on it. "I've really made an
effort to block out any consideration of other political plans until
after this election," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area 'Gentleman's Fishery' Turns Nasty</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Nothing makes Mark Kuljis feel more alive than a strong run of
herring on those winter nights when the hoarse shouts of his fellow
fishermen compete with the complaints of sea gulls overhead.</LD>
<LD>   On board the Lori Marie K, a 40-foot aluminum bowpicker named for
Kuljis' ex-wife, the gill net winds up from the coal-black water to
deposit hundreds of foot-long herring that flop about the deck like
ricocheting bullets.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old Kuljis is among hundreds of commercial fishermen who
four months a year pursue the blue-green and silver catch within the calm
confines of San Francisco Bay--where, unlike the Bering Sea herring
fields, there are no perfect storms.</LD>
<TE>   Working in what experts call one of the nation's last remaining urban
fisheries, boats like the Red Herring, No Problem, the Stress Point and
Lethal Weapon harvest within the shadows of the city--off Alcatraz
Island, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, along the deserted Naval
shipyards south of Pac Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   But after three decades of economic smooth sailing, the local herring
fishery is caught between two unrelated realities: reduced local catch
quotas and a shift in the culture and financial climate of an island
nation half a world away.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the primary market for Bay Area herring, tastes among
younger Japanese are changing. Teenagers now eat more fast food and less
sushi, including the sacks of golden-yellow herring roe, called kazunoko.
And with Japan in a recession, their parents are forgoing the
higher-priced roe herring for cheaper salmon and tuna.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Fishermen who once earned $2,400 per ton of herring have
seen the price plummet to $700 in recent years.</TE>
<TE>Jostling for Fishing Space</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese teens would rather go to Burger King than eat sushi, causing
a ripple effect," said fisherman Bill Schoening. "Fishermen feel the
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   The unstable market has brought new competition among the 150 boats
that gather here from November to March, migrating from Alaska, Puget
Sound and Monterey Bay. Tensions have flared when scores of fishermen
jostle for space to catch fish as the herring spawn along the bay's rocky
shore.</TE>
<TE>   In a 20-square-mile area once referred to as a "gentleman's fishery"
for its good-natured camaraderie, $1,000 gill nets have been cut. Anchors
have been thrown through boat windshields. There have been fistfights and
worse.</TE>
<TE>   "During one scrape, a fisherman climbed aboard another boat with a
knife in his teeth, swinging and cussing," said Department of Fish and
Game Lt. Keith Long.</TE>
<TE>   Many boats have invested a small fortune in permits and equipment.
Fishermen fight to protect their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get a dozen boats stuffing their nets into the same place,
it can get pretty testy," said Schoening, a retired fire inspector. "It's
survival of the fastest."</TE>
<TE>   Now there are even fewer herring to be caught. In an attempt to
preserve the fishery's long-term livelihood, state officials have reduced
the annual catch limit from 13,500 tons in 1996 to 4,500 tons this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The measures came after warm El Nino currents, pollution and
competition for food with anchovies and sardines reduced the cold-water
herring schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This fishery is worth fighting for," said Eric Larson, a state
Department of Fish and Game biologist. "As America becomes
industrialized, fisheries like this one that are close to home are being
depleted--their habitats are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Since relocating to the Bay Area four years ago, Kuljis has watched
herring catch numbers drop like an anchor toward the sea floor. As a
result of the weaker market and diminished quotas, a herring permit that
cost $60,000 several years ago when times were good can now be purchased
for $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kuljis, a Washington state native, comes from a family of fishermen:
His grandfather, father and three uncles all trolled for salmon and
herring along the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   When salmon prices dropped, he opened a Marin County anchovy bait
business and joined the local herring hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Kuljis says he has never seen such competition among fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Like the day that one sharp-elbowed bowpicker poached a fishing spot
he had spent hours finding.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to put up a screaming match with these guys," he says. "But
not anymore. Now I just find another place to fish."</TE>
<TE>   Out on the Lori Marie K, Kuljis endures more routine occupational
perils. He and his crew must often navigate 10-foot swells and a strong
undertow near rocks and piers while avoiding the speedy ferryboats. One
man this season lost two fingers when his hand became caught in an
on-deck hydraulic winch.</TE>
<TE>   State wardens have worked to control the violence while preserving the
size and health of the catch--ranking the San Francisco Bay among the
nation's five best-managed fisheries, according to the National Fisherman
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They formed an advisory board of herring fishermen to improve
relations and create a system of staggered fishing fleets so everybody
gets a chance at carving out their share of the catch limits.</TE>
<TE>   But the exhausting work of finding and catching the herring has become
a covert game of spy versus spy. Boats hailing from the same cities work
in teams, using radio signals, scanners and scramblers to keep their
on-water communications secret.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only a half-dozen large herring spawns each season, so
finding one is striking gold," Schoening said. "If you and your crew can
be the first ones in on a good set, you can catch a lot of fish."</TE>
<TE>Time-Tested Traditions</TE>
<TE>   With a Sunday-to-Friday fishing window (leaving the bay open on
Saturdays for pleasure craft), the two-man crews stay aboard the cramped
bowpickers for days. Kuljis--a stocky man with a stud earring in one
lobe--remains awake for 48 hours at a time, striving for his seasonal
goal of 80 tons of herring in his hold. The 400 fishermen rotate so that
only 75 boats and 150 anglers are working at once, a limit enforced by
Fish and Game officials.</TE>
<TE>   To track his prey, Kuljis follows time-tested traditions that range
from echo-sounding sonar to following the tides and the phases of the
moon. Veterans believe the herring won't enter the bay until the
anchovies and sardines are driven to sea by winter waters from the
Sacramento River.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the best fishing comes after dark during mean tides, when the
fishermen scan the water for silvery flashes. At night, there is less
competition with the birds and sea lions.</TE>
<TE>   "During spawns, every creature shows up for a piece of the action,"
said Larson. "It's an all-you-can-eat feeding frenzy. Everybody wants to
be where the fish are."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, Kuljis prepares to pull his nets from alongside a
deserted Navy dry dock.</TE>
<TE>   "I dunno," he tells veteran crewman David Hays, nicknamed Purple Haze.
"There's some Monterey guys. If we start now, they'll summon every boat
on the bay."</TE>
<TE>   But they crank up the winch and reel in the net. Resembling a cobweb
strung from the boat, the net rises from the water as a machine called a
shaker loosens the fish from the mesh. Soon, the deck is covered with
flopping fish, their gills bloody from their struggles.</TE>
<TE>   Kuljis and Hays wear tattered black raincoats to shield themselves
from the coating of scales that soon cover the deck like a fresh
snowfall. Nearby, another fully loaded bowpicker heads for port, a clutch
of seabirds trailing like worried chaperons.</TE>
<TE>   While the protected harbor provides less adventure, most fishermen
enjoy their months on calm waters. "We can see the traffic jams onshore,
but it's quiet out here," Hays says.</TE>
<TE>   When the herring aren't spawning, the boats huddle in groups and the
crews trade fish stories. Some risk-takers head to shore for an afternoon
matinee--wearing pagers in case the fish appear.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the fleet's proximity to terra firma causes problems.</TE>
<TE>   Marin County homeowners complain about the racket during late-night
herring spawns next to million-dollar shoreline homes.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen such as Schoening dismiss the complaints: "A few
fuddy-duddies can ruin a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   But Kuljis admits that nighttime noise levels are often high. "When
you've got all those fishermen yelling and motors roaring, it's really
loud."</TE>
<TE>   State officials now enforce no-wake speeds near shore, require engine
mufflers and have reduced the use of noisy deck speakers.</TE>
<TE>   They also outlaw the small M-80 firecrackers that fishermen detonated
to scare the sea lions that patrol their nets. And they monitor the size
of the mesh gaps so fishermen take only mature fish, allowing smaller
herring to swim through.</TE>
<TE>   Kuljis welcomes any scrutiny to save the only living he has every
known. "I've never had a 9-to-5 job," he sighs. "I'm a fisherman. This is
what I do."</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>The Marine Corps helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Sunday that
killed two crew members and injured five others involved troops from the
same San Diego base that lost seven Marines in a plane crash in the war
zone just 11 days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Department officials said the early-morning crash was
apparently the result of mechanical problems with the CH-53E Super
Stallion helicopter. The crew was from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar
in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   An emotionally wrenching memorial service was held at the base
Thursday for seven Marines killed Jan. 9 when their KC-130 Hercules
transport and refueling plane slammed into a mountain in Pakistan while
attempting a night landing.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like somebody stepping on your heart," Miramar spokesman Maj.
T.V. Johnson said of the latest crash. "We were just beginning to get
over the loss of seven Marines and now this. . . . Every Marine realizes:
'It could as easily been me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Super Stallion was on a routine resupply mission when it made a
"hard landing" in mountains about 40 miles from the Bagram air base north
of Kabul, the Afghan capital, officials said. The crash occurred in
daylight about 30 minutes after takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Killed were Staff Sgt. Walter F. Cohee, 26, of Wicomico County, Md., a
communications navigation technician, and Sgt. Dwight J. Morgan, 24, of
Willits in Mendocino County, Calif., a helicopter mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   Cohee's mother, Jeanne, said he was eager to go to Afghanistan despite
the dangers. "He told me: 'I hate to tell you this, but if they ask for
volunteers, I'm going. I signed up to help my country, and that's what
I'm going to do,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's former high school principal remembered him as a quiet,
likable youth who excelled in mechanics classes and decided early in his
senior year that he wanted to be a Marine.</TE>
<TE>   "His mother was real proud of Dwight and his accomplishments and the
success he was having in the Marines," said Keller McDonald, who was
principal of Willits High School when Morgan graduated in 1995.
"Certainly it's a shock to this community and his family."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was due to be promoted soon to staff sergeant, and that
promotion will be made posthumously, officials said. Morgan's wife,
Teresa, is expecting their second child, friends said. The couple also
have a 4-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's mother, Mary Trimmer, drove to San Diego from Huntington
Beach to be with Teresa.</TE>
<TE>   Don Willett, a family friend, said Morgan loved the order and
discipline of the Marine Corps and especially loved working on
helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew exactly what he wanted to do," Willett said. "He had his
whole life planned."</TE>
<TE>   Injured were Cpl. David Lynne, 23, of Mecklenburg County, N.C., the
helicopter crew chief; Cpl. Ivan Montanez, 22, of Hayes County, Texas, a
mechanic; Cpl. Stephen A. Sullivan, 24, of Pickens County, S.C., a crew
chief; Capt. William J. Cody, 30, of Middlesex County, N.J., a pilot; and
Capt. Douglas V. Glasgow, 33, of Wayne County, Ohio, a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The two crashes involving Miramar aircraft and troops make January the
deadliest month to date for U.S. military personnel in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Your heart just breaks every time something like this happens,"
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The five injured Marines were flown to a U.S. medical facility in the
region, officials said. Their injuries are considered moderate and not
life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Marine Corps has sent thousands of infantry troops from
Camp Pendleton and Camp Lejeune, N.C., to Afghanistan, those troops have
suffered no fatalities. The Marines who have died were all on supply
missions; the KC-130 was taking fuel to forward locations. The cause of
the plane's crash, however, has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the Marines involved in the Super Stallion crash were assigned
to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, the Flying Tigers, at Miramar.
Glasgow is stationed at the Marine air station in Yuma, Ariz., but was
assigned to fly with the Miramar squadron, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with a policy of not releasing information about ongoing
operations, the military did not specify what type of supply mission the
helicopter was conducting. But it is known that U.S. Special Forces are
in the nearby mountains searching for Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Names of the dead and injured were withheld until officials could
break the news to family members. "My kitchen window faces the driveway,
and when I looked out and there were three Marines . . . I knew they were
not coming to give me good news," Cohee said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohee said her son planned a career in the Marines: "The Marines, to
him, were the best." He had been scheduled to return to San Diego earlier
this month, but a heavy workload kept him in Afghanistan, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident was the third fatal crash of U.S. aircraft in the Afghan
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Two Army Rangers were killed in October when their Black Hawk
helicopter crashed in Pakistan during a nighttime operation to support a
raid near Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Only two U.S. personnel are known to have been killed by enemy fire in
the 3-month-old war: a soldier who died in an ambush this month and a CIA
operative killed during an uprising of prisoners near Mazar-i-Sharif in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Three Army Green Berets were killed Dec. 5 when a 2,000-pound bomb
from a U.S. plane landed 100 yards from their position during the battle
for Kandahar between opposition fighters and Taliban and Al Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   The CH-53E Super Stallion is a workhorse helicopter of older design.
Marine officials have been concerned about the age of their helicopter
fleet and have been working for years to replace the CH-53E and CH-46 Sea
Knight helicopters with the new but controversial tilt-rotor Osprey
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps' fleet of Super Stallions has been grounded twice in
recent years after fatal crashes. In 2000, the helicopters were grounded
for three weeks after a Navy variant of the Super Stallion crashed off
the coast of Texas, killing four people.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines replaced the swash plates on the helicopters, a critical
part that provides a coupling between the craft and its moving rotors.
Problems with the swash plate had been blamed for a 1996 crash that
killed four people at the helicopter plant in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, the Super Stallions and other military helicopters
have been used to fly daily missions over long distances and rough
terrain to keep troops in forward bases supplied with ammunition, food
and gear.</TE>
<TE>   Marine spokesman 1st Lt. James Jarvis said there was no initial
indication that the Super Stallion was hit by hostile fire even though
Taliban and Al Qaeda forces are known to have shoulder-launched Stinger
missiles. The missiles were given to Afghan fighters by the CIA during
their decade-long war against Soviet forces in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The CH-53E--with a replacement cost of $26 million--is capable of
lifting 16 tons of cargo, carrying more than 50 troops and being refueled
in flight. Although the movement of troops and cargo is its primary
mission, the Super Stallion is also used on rescue operations.</TE>
<TE>   Two CH-53Es helped rescue Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady when his plane
crashed in Bosnia in June 1995. The same type of helicopter also rescued
American and other allied personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Somalia in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Sunday, the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said military and intelligence officials in
Afghanistan had told him recently that they believe Bin Laden remains in
east-central Afghanistan or across the border in Pakistan's North-West
Frontier province.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said on "Fox News Sunday" that while
Bin Laden's precise location remained uncertain, this was the view of
"more than 50%" of those he spoke to on a recent trip to the region.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's whereabouts have remained a subject of intense interest,
but top U.S. officials have continued to insist that they don't know
where he is or whether he is alive.</TE>
<TE>   Both Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell reiterated that
view in TV appearances Sunday. Powell said on "Fox News Sunday" that
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was "just speculating" when he said
last week that he believed Bin Laden had died of kidney failure.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also signaled that the military is about to give up
control of John Walker Lindh, the young California man accused of
fighting with the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he believed that Lindh would be turned over to civilian
officials in the "next several days," depending on how soon the military
could arrange transportation. Lindh is being held on the amphibious
assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said Lindh will probably go on trial in federal court in
northern Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said military officials intend to
put him "in control of the FBI in the coming days."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld sought to rebut an allegation by Lindh's parents that he has
not been allowed to talk to the lawyer they have retained.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my understanding that he has not asked to have a lawyer,"
Rumsfeld said.</TE>

<HD>Nations Promise Funds to Afghans</HD>
<DH>Aid: Pledges at Tokyo conference total more than $1.7 billion so
far, with the U.S. earmarking $296.7 million. Interim prime minister
seeks to reassure the donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>The United States and other nations pledged more than $1.7 billion
for Afghanistan today at the opening of a two-day reconstruction
conference here in an effort to reverse 23 years of war, famine, intrigue
and chaos.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers expressed the hope that more control by Afghans and more
vigilance by the international community will help end the nation's role
as a breeding ground for terrorism. They also sought to prevent the
corruption, waste, overlap and misguided priorities of other recent
global efforts to rebuild war-ravaged regions.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to set a high bar for other nations, the United States opened
with a pledge of $296.7 million this year in addition to $400 million in
humanitarian aid already allocated, with a promise of more to follow.</LD>
<TE>   "This conference is not about rhetoric, it's about resources,"
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, "so I'm going to go right to the
bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. offer was quickly followed by pledges from the meeting's
other co-chairs: $500 million from the European Union in 2002, $500
million from Japan over the next 30 months and $220 million from Saudi
Arabia over a three-year period. Smaller pledges were received from
several other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Lining up these promises is the first step. Spending the money
effectively and avoiding donor fatigue over the next decade will be far
more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai walked a fine line in his
opening speech. He underscored how badly hit his nation has been and how
much it needs--even needling the participants by mentioning the lavish
breakfasts they had all enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he sought to reassure his audience that Afghanistan
would use any money wisely, fighting drug production, stemming corruption
and getting off international welfare rolls as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd much rather be in your position as potential donors than to be a
supplicant," he said. "We Afghan people are a proud and self-sufficient
people."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the glitzy hotel conference room where the meeting is taking
place contrasted sharply with the images of hunger, disease,
discrimination, abuse, homelessness and economic despair coming out of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>$45-Billion Estimate Drew a Cool Response</TE>
<TE>   Even before its official opening, the conference saw a blizzard of
statistics as international agencies and governments dickered over how
much money is needed, who should control the funds, how much should go to
various priorities and what time frame should apply. The conference is
designed to resolve many of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's planning minister said this month that the ultimate
price tag for rebuilding the country could be $45 billion over the next
decade. This number was greeted coolly by donors, however. The United
Nations has outlined a $14.9-billion target over a decade and $5 billion
over the next five years, while other development officials say $1.7
billion is needed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really too early to tell," said a senior official with one of
the co-chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the figures cited provided a hint of how difficult it will be
to address so many problems at once. One in six Afghans dies before age
3, two-thirds of the nation's adults are illiterate, half of all children
are chronically malnourished, just 3% of girls attend elementary school
(compared with 38% of boys), and an estimated 3,000 people are maimed by
land mines every year.</TE>
<TE>   A well-oiled, efficient, corruption-free rebuilding effort is probably
more than anyone can expect in a country without a stable legal system,
government or economy. But conference organizers said they will try to
learn from past mistakes and avoid some of the most obvious pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>Database Proposed to Keep Track of It All</TE>
<TE>   Organizers are proposing a comprehensive database tentatively named
Gateway that would help streamline efforts and prevent duplication. In
theory, this centralized list of projects and funding levels would allow
donors to see which areas are well-funded and which are ignored--to
avoid, for instance, duplicate roads in one part of the country and a
lack of transport links in another.</TE>
<TE>   Also under discussion is a donor code of conduct to improve spending
efficiency.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood's unofficial mourning period appears to be over, as
celebrities donned their feathers and sequins and emerged from their
roped-off enclaves to tout themselves and hawk their films at Sunday's
Golden Globes ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since Sept. 11, blatant self-promotion and studio-manufactured
giddiness have been taboo in Hollywood, as lavish premieres were
canceled, and many stars demurred from the talk-show circuit. The last
major award show, the 53rd Prime-Time Emmy Awards, kept shifting from
date to date like an unwanted dinner guest, until it finally landed on
Nov 4. Even then, the tone was subdued, with many celebrity no-shows, and
the first dress code (business attire) enforced at an awards show since
World War II.</LD>
<LD>   No longer.</LD>
<TE>   "I think there's an acknowledgment and acceptance that we can make our
life better and richer by embracing celebration moments, parties, of life
itself," said "Moulin Rouge" director Baz Luhrmann. "It's like the 16th
century with the plague, you accept that you're living with something
dangerous, but you make the moments count. I'm feeling that tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Sounding a bit like Noel Coward performing during the London Blitz in
World War II, Globes presenter Michael Caine said, "I'm from England.
We've been doing this for years. Better to do this than get blown up,
don't you think?"</TE>
<TE>   As for the awards themselves, "Moulin Rouge" won for best film
comedy/musical, while "A Beautiful Mind," director Ron Howard's
exploration of schizophrenic mathematician John Nash, took the prize for
best drama. The top acting prizes were split between Australians and
Americans. Aussie stars Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe garnered awards
for "Moulin Rouge" and "A Beautiful Mind," respectively, while veteran
Americans Sissy Spacek and Gene Hackman won for "In the Bedroom" and "The
Royal Tenenbaums," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it was not quite Hollywood business as usual Sunday night.
The police presence was 10 times the size it was in the past, and
included marksmen with rifles on the roof of the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
where the Golden Globes were presented.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Kingsley, a nominee for the movie "Sexy Beast" and the TV movie
"Anne Frank," said, "I think it's reassuring for people who are watching
to see that we're all in this together. And good for us too. As my car
was being searched, I thought, I feel safer."</TE>
<TE>   For many, the frivolity seemed to mark a psychic turning point for the
industry. Hollywood was not only buffeted by the terrorist attacks, but
also a slowdown in production due in part to a flood of activity in the
first part of 2001 spurred by the threat of strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hollywood movie business was completely stalled out for very good
reason after 9/11. Now that there's becoming enough distance between that
tragic event and today, people are feeling very eager to work," said "A
Beautiful Mind" producer Brian Grazer. "What's helping to magnify that is
awards season, where you're appreciating and thinking about movies in
their purest form."</TE>
<TE>   For the studios that spend millions of dollars on awards campaigns,
the event is an all-important marketing bonanza, capable of not only
selling Hollywood products in 135 countries but also in shaping the Oscar
race. Fashion insiders are also breathing easier now that their prime
billboards--the stars--are willing to don the requisite finery.</TE>
<TE>   "Glamour and fantasy are Hollywood," said wardrobe stylist Tod
Hallman. "A lot of people still like to see movie stars get dressed up.
It's a great escape, and I hope we have not lost that."</TE>
<TE>   The stars did their part to entertain, although the fashion show was
heavy on basic black, with bared shoulders and pulled-back hair. Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Calista Flockhart and Jennifer Garner all wore sleek red,
while Rachel Griffiths wore a loony pink-fringed dress and Sela Ward
donned a red midriff-baring Valentino gown with an unfortunate Carmen
Miranda touch.</TE>
<TE>   Only one little-known actress, Cynthia Garrett, in a stunt that
definitely caught photographers' attention, wore a red-white-and-blue
sequined flag dress. Indeed, unlike previous awards shows in which
performers sang patriotic tunes such as "America the Beautiful,"
references to Sept. 11 were mostly oblique, as when "Sex and the City"
star Sarah Jessica Parker, Golden Globe winner for best actress in a
comedy, thanked "New York, the fifth lady." The show is set in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., the Golden Globes have
long been considered one of the sillier awards but the most fun for those
who actually attend. Given the glassy-eyed look and bitten lips revealed
by some of the losers, that freewheeling attitude might be changing, as
stars invest in winning the statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   For fashion companies, landing on the red carpet earns priceless
worldwide exposure that may translate directly into sales. When Los
Angeles designer Allen B. Schwartz rushed $290 imitations of the pink
Ralph Lauren ball gown that Gwyneth Paltrow wore when she won her Oscar
in 1999, he sold nearly 10,000 lower-priced copies in a matter of months.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the industry caution that despite the air of festivity
Sunday, and the fact that the stars had nine Golden Globe fetes to choose
from, as opposed to the one party following the Emmys, not all is well in
the kingdom of Hollywood, particularly in the TV sector, which has been
hard hit by the recession.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can't mistake an actor or actress doing their business
with what's going on inside of them or what's going on inside the
business," said manager Joan Hyler. "I don't think we've readopted the
old air of frivolousness. I just think people are human, and we're all
going back."</TE>
<TE>   The heavy security Sunday night meant that the chasm between the haves
and have-nots is growing wider. The bleachers were noticeably smaller in
size than in the past and were placed farther away from action. Indeed,
some fans had to content themselves with outposts along Santa Monica
Boulevard, where they could watch the limousines, with tinted windows,
roll by.</TE>
<TE>   "The saddest thing is the fans can't participate this year," said
Beverly Hills Police Officer Rick King. "That's too bad. The fans really
enjoy it, and the stars really enjoy it too."</TE>
<TE>   Two longtime fans, Elmer and Fran Armstrong of St. Louis, decided to
forgo their usual trip westward for the Oscars to come to the Globes
instead. They've heard rumors that the bleachers might be banned
altogether from the Academy Awards in their new Hollywood home, the Kodak
Theatre. Said Elmer Armstrong, "We really wanted to do this because we
don't think we can get in at the Oscars."</TE>

<HD>Colombia Sides Agree to Reach Truce by April</HD>
<DH>S. America: Just hours before deadline, the government and rebels
vow to resume talks. The conflict had threatened to draw in the United
States.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>This country and leftist rebels agreed late Sunday on a blueprint
for future peace talks, preventing a return to full-scale war and
breathing life into long-stalled negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   With only a few hours to go before a midnight deadline, the two sides
announced an ambitious schedule to reach a truce by April that would put
a stop to all hostilities in the country's nearly 4-decade-old internal
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   But the last-minute scramble for a peace breakthrough came amid signs
that the two sides were readying for a wider war that threatened to draw
the United States deeper into a messy conflict that already claims 3,500
lives a year.</LD>
<TE>   "The parties recognize that a politically negotiated solution is the
way to resolve the armed conflict in Colombia," said Camilo Gomez, the
government's chief negotiator. "We are going to spend all of our efforts
to continue working in an atmosphere of mutual trust with the hopes of
reaching accords that will allow us to advance the process."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators from the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, appeared remarkably relaxed after one of the most
nerve-racking weeks in the history of the three-year peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, President Andres Pastrana was hours away from ordering
troops to retake from the rebels a Switzerland-size demilitarized zone
created for the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sunday, international diplomats and white-robed religious
leaders were smiling and shaking hands with camouflage-clad FARC rebels
in celebration of the new agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In a national TV address late Sunday, Pastrana said he would continue
the zone's existence through April 10 and held out hope for peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, to get back on track to a politically negotiated solution, we
only have to work without pause to demonstrate with concrete acts that
peace is possible," Pastrana said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides agreed to discuss several issues that have bogged down
the talks, including an end to hostilities and kidnappings, government
action against the country's right-wing paramilitary groups, and economic
and social justice for Colombia's millions of poor and unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, they also agreed to allow international observers from
the United Nations, the Roman Catholic Church and a group of 10 countries
to continue to participate in the peace process, something long resisted
by both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The cessation of hostilities is a top priority for the government.
FARC leaders want a simple stop to fighting with the army. But the
government insists that the FARC also end the kidnappings and extortion
that provide a substantial portion of the group's estimated
$300-to-$500-million annual income.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the FARC is most interested in major structural reforms
in line with its Marxist agenda, including redistribution of land to poor
farmers and increased social benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the good feelings, doubts remained about the two sides'
commitment to the process, which to date has resulted in few achievements
and much disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian government spent much of last week renewing calls for
direct military support from the United States, which until now has
limited aid to counter-narcotics efforts. The U.S. granted $1.3 billion
in aid to Colombia two years ago, most of it in the form of training and
military equipment in the war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In response to last week's urging, U.S. officials said they were
reviewing their policy in Colombia but had made no decisions. Last
summer, embassy officials in Bogota said they were considering a plan to
train new Colombian military units to protect elements of the
infrastructure, such as oil pipelines and energy towers, that have been
the objects of frequent rebel attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideas are floated all the time. But . . . there's still a long way
between here and there," a State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of U.S. policy in the region have predicted some form of
direct American military aid to Colombia, raising worries about whether
the U.S. would become more involved in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, they'll cross the line from counter-narcotics to
counterinsurgency," said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert for the Center
for International Policy, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   FARC rebels mounted scattered attacks throughout the nation last week.
The rebel army controls an estimated 40% of the countryside, mostly rural
areas where a government presence is nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials blamed the rebels for more than 40 deaths
last week, including those of police officers, soldiers and civilians. In
one case, rebels forced down a Huey helicopter being used by police as
part of an anti-narcotics mission.</TE>

<HD>Polish Populist: Defender of Downtrodden, or Budding Dictator?</HD>
<DH>Europe: Farm leader stirs up politicians and the public. Some see
him as a threat to democracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>Andrzej Lepper, the bad boy of Polish politics, is a man who enjoys
attention and knows how to get it.</LD>
<LD>   In an attack on the Polish establishment, the leader of Self-Defense,
a farmers union and populist party, alleged late last year that five
prominent politicians were taking bribes. Lepper based the charges,
phrased in the form of questions, on information he said came from a farm
manager named Bogdan Gasinski.</LD>
<LD>   Days later, Gasinski, who has been accused of financial misconduct,
discredited himself in the eyes of investigators and the Polish public
with a fantastic shopping list of additional allegations. He claimed that
the Taliban regime had experimented with anthrax on the farm he had
managed and that Polish politicians were involved in smuggling drugs,
disguised as shipments of gems, from Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Lepper has been charged with slander for the bribery allegations, made
during a fiery speech he gave just before Parliament booted him out of a
deputy speaker post Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   He had been awarded that position in what commentators called an
attempt to "tame" him after Self-Defense made a strong third-place
showing in September parliamentary elections. But he had continued with
behavior and comments that were seen as outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   These included calling Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz a
"scumbag." He also joined a protest in Wloclawek that blocked a
court-appointed officer and police from evicting an illegal bazaar. The
site was later cleared.</TE>
<TE>   Top politicians critical of Lepper are pushing for legislators to
strip him of his parliamentary immunity so that a trial on the slander
charges can proceed. If convicted, he could face up to two years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lepper brushes off his turns of fortune from radical outsider to
rising parliamentary leader back to political outcast. His future is
brighter than ever, he insists.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not hide the fact that we want to take over power and will do
everything in order to rule Poland," he said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>Economic Woes May Work in His Favor</TE>
<TE>   With unemployment in Poland at 17% and economic growth falling to just
1% last year compared with 4% in 2000, the many losers in the transition
to capitalism increasingly may be attracted by a hard-line populist such
as Lepper.</TE>
<TE>   "The political and economic situation in Poland is something which is
very favorable to Self-Defense," Lepper said. "We are warning those who
rule: If they do not change the social, economic and political policy of
the state, then we are going to have a public explosion. I will not be
afraid to be at the head of that explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lepper threatened to organize a nationwide strike if the
government fails to improve the "extremely bad" situation for farmers. He
did not say what kind of strike he had in mind. But from 1997 to 2000,
Self-Defense repeatedly used roadblocks to stage violent protests against
farm imports.</TE>
<TE>   Lepper describes himself as a centrist battling on behalf of common
people and against corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy when I'm among people in enterprises that are going
bankrupt, during meetings with farmers, pensioners and those who are
unemployed," he said. "There are no people there who are against me."</TE>
<TE>   Lepper has a significant following not just among the rural and urban
poor but also among farm owners who have taken out loans they cannot
repay and small-business operators who believe that the economic system
is stacked against them as they compete with big domestic and foreign
firms.</TE>
<TE>   A December survey by OBOP, a major polling agency, found that even
after he was stripped of his deputy speaker's post, Lepper still had the
backing of a large minority. Among respondents, 39% said he acts for the
"good" of democracy--down from 55% support in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all his caricature-like qualities, Lepper expresses the
feelings of the lower-middle class whose flirt with capitalism has been a
flop," commentator Slawomir Majman wrote in the Warsaw Voice.</TE>
<TE>   Lepper's supporters are "those who wanted to move on from the market
stall to a shop but were crushed by the supermarkets" and "office workers
incapable of functioning in a computerized reality that prefers young
people," Majman wrote. They also include workers in heavy industries who
are threatened by layoffs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lepper says he doesn't oppose Polish entry into the European Union,
which the government is aiming for in 2004. However, he bitterly attacks
the terms that Warsaw has been negotiating, especially concessions on
rules for the sale of farmland and for trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Euro-realist," Lepper said. "I do not believe in any subsidies,
in the help of the European Union, which today is undergoing an economic
and social crisis. They will not give us something for free. Poland has
to be strong. It has to have strong industry and strong agriculture, and
then we can set conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Lepper's critics see his demands as ruling out the possibility of EU
membership for many years, and they fear that his rhetoric might undercut
the public support needed for joining.</TE>
<TE>   Critics often liken Lepper to Alexander G. Lukashenko, the president
of Belarus, Poland's poverty-stricken eastern neighbor. Lukashenko, who
is sometimes called "Europe's last dictator," was reelected last year in
balloting that the United States and the EU said was neither free nor
fair.</TE>
<TE>   "Lepper just wants power," said Donald Tusk, co-leader of Civic
Platform, the main opposition party. "He wants to be a Polish Lukashenko.
And Lukashenko is only funny if you live 1,000 miles away from him."</TE>
<TE>   If Lepper takes power, "he will degrade Poland to the level of
Belarus," Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, a Polish commentator living in
Washington, wrote in Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest-circulation
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "One may fear something even worse," continued Nowak-Jezioranski, a
World War II hero. "Unemployment and deep economic crisis . . . opened
Hitler's way to power. There appears a realistic possibility that Lepper
may reach for power in the near future, either in consequence of the
social unrest he himself stimulates, or by gaining a majority in the next
free elections. Can one be sure, in light of what he says and does, that
his governance will respect civil rights and the rights of his opponents
in particular?"</TE>
<TE>   Other observers express less alarm, arguing that Poles--with a long
tradition of skepticism toward authority--are not susceptible to
demagoguery.</TE>
<TE>'It's Not Me Who's a Threat to Democracy'</TE>
<TE>   Lepper laughs at the idea that he is a threat to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "A democracy that left a situation where 5% of society leads a very
rich life, much above the average, and 75% has no means to live in
dignity is not a democracy," he said. "It's not me who's a threat to
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   What puts democracy at risk, Lepper said, is the way in which
market-oriented reforms were implemented in the 1990s, and actions such
as the filing of slander charges against him "for words spoken from the
parliamentary floor."</TE>
<TE>   "I simply asked questions," Lepper said. "In Poland, corruption goes
right to the very top of power. The ties of politicians with gangsters
are quite clearly visible. I'm not afraid. Let them do whatever they want
to do. Let them take away my immunity, and I will still continue to speak
the truth from the Parliament floor. Even if they sentence me to go to
prison, I will still come here to sessions of Parliament in my prison
garb."</TE>

<HD>Congolese Find Scant Help Next Door</HD>
<DH>Africa: Thousands return home from Rwanda despite hazards presented
by a volatile volcano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GISENYI, Rwanda
</DL>
<LD>Complaining of a chilly reception and scant help, tens of thousands
of Congolese left here Sunday to return to the ravaged town of Goma, four
days after fleeing from a deadly volcano.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the day, refugees carrying children, belongings and
livestock crossed the Rwandan border into Congo despite warnings from
U.N. officials that they faced dangers from contaminated water, toxic
gases and more eruptions by Mt. Nyiragongo.</LD>
<LD>   As the Congolese packed their possessions and bid a bitter goodbye to
this lakeside town, many said they had been forced to pay Rwandans for
small drinks of water and had received no food or medical treatment. By
nightfall, the tens of thousands of Gomans who had lined the streets here
for the last three nights were gone.</LD>
<TE>   Many Gomans said they preferred to be homeless in their own country.</TE>
<TE>   "In Rwanda, we were roaming all over looking for a resting place,"
said Bizibu Dieu Donne, who carried a goat over his shoulder as he
crossed into Goma. "We've seen refugee camps and do not like them. We
don't want to be refugees."</TE>
<TE>   Braving a cold rain, many Gomans walked across still-smoldering beds
of lava to get to their former neighborhoods. Some said they wanted to
see if their homes were still standing and if their belongings had
survived the looting that began Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Constance Wanandeke, 61, returned to find her house intact. The lava
that destroyed most of her neighbors' homes had stopped and hardened near
her front steps.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why I was so lucky, but someone was looking out for me,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mdombi Bonnane, 38, was not one of the lucky ones. She returned from
Gisenyi to find the entire village of Majengo, near the Goma airport,
covered with lava. Scattered bricks and gnarled sheets of metal roofing
encased in the lava were the only evidence that her house had existed.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnane, already a mother of eight, became a mother of 12 on Sunday
when she adopted four young children whose parents were apparently killed
by the volcano.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnane and the 12 children had not eaten anything since Saturday
night, yet she was optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Help will come," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonnane and other displaced people will have to wait. The United
Nations has set up two refugee camps about 15 miles inside Rwanda.
However, the facilities house only 5,000 of the nearly 500,000 people
displaced.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Melo, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, said the
relief agency was still determining how to help the refugees who had
returned to Goma.</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe the situation in Goma is not stable," she said. "We
are advising people not to go there right now."</TE>
<TE>   Immediate help was also being hindered Sunday by the rivalry between
the Congolese government and the Congolese Rally for Democracy, the
Rwandan-backed rebel group that controls the city.</TE>
<TE>   RCD leader Adolphe Onusumba Yemba said his group had rebuffed offers
of assistance from the government in Kinshasa, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with politics and the war we're fighting," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night, a light rain fell in the area around Goma, soaking
refugees on both sides of the border.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Soldiers Take Control of Palestinian Town</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Troops tighten grip around Arafat, keeping him locked up
in Ramallah compound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces took control of the West Bank town of Tulkarm today,
the governor said, marking the largest raid of a Palestinian town in 16
months of fighting. Hours earlier, thousands of Palestinians marched to
protest Israel's blockade of their leader, Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Izzedine Sharif, the Palestinian governor of Tulkarm, said tanks
entered the town from all directions before dawn, as four helicopters
flew above. A Palestinian security official said about 100 tanks and
armored personnel carriers participated in the raid.</LD>
<LD>   Sharif said Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew, then moved from house
to house, arresting dozens of suspected militants.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli military had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops have repeatedly entered Palestinian cities in the 16
months of bloodshed, taking control of some neighborhoods for limited
periods. Today's raid marked the first time that forces took up positions
in an entire town.</TE>
<TE>   Troops also surrounded the two adjacent Tulkarm and Nur esh Shams
refugee camps, apparently preparing to enter, Sharif said.</TE>
<TE>   The raid came in reprisal for an attack by a Palestinian militant on a
banquet hall in Israel last week. The assailant killed six Israelis
before being shot dead by police.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman was a former Palestinian policeman and a member of the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   In other reprisals for the banquet hall attack, Israeli tanks have
surrounded Arafat's headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
keeping the Palestinian Authority president confined there.</TE>
<TE>   Another tank deployed to Ramallah to pressure Arafat got stuck in a
narrow street Sunday and became the focus of a gun battle. Twelve
Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has confined
Arafat to Ramallah since December, saying he will not be allowed to leave
until the Palestinian Authority arrests the assassins of an Israeli
Cabinet minister. Israel tightened its grip Friday, moving tanks and
armored personnel carriers just outside the gates of Arafat's office.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, several hundred Palestinian journalists and academics who
support Arafat's Fatah movement marched to the Palestinian broadcasting
center destroyed in an Israeli explosion a day earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Defend the Palestinian territories and defend our President Arafat,"
said a Fatah leaflet distributed by the marchers.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City, several thousand supporters marched to Arafat's seaside
compound, though he hasn't been able to work there in nearly two months.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan
</DL>
<LD>President Chen Shui-bian today named his chief of staff, who has
limited experience in administration, prime minister in a Cabinet
reshuffle aimed at rescuing the flagging economy.</LD>
<LD>   Chen named Yu Shyi-kun to the post, a move that outgoing Prime
Minister Chang Chun-hsiung said was aimed at helping Chen's reelection in
2004.</LD>
<LD>   Yu, 53, is a former vice premier and was mayor of the northeastern
rural county of Ilan from 1989 to 1997. He retains a grass-roots manner
and accent from his days there.</LD>
<TE>   Yu replaces Chang, whose popularity rating has been low since he took
office in October 2000. Chang is expected to be named a senior advisor to
the president.</TE>
<TE>   Chen told a news conference that Yu would name a new Cabinet as soon
as possible.</TE>

<HD>China Frees Tibetan Scholar From Prison</HD>
<DH>Human rights: Beijing releases man just ahead of Bush visit. U.S.
had asked about his case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Chinese authorities released a Tibetan music scholar jailed six
years on espionage charges and sent him to the U.S. on Sunday, just one
month before President Bush is to visit China.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. legislators, in letters to the Chinese government, had repeatedly
raised the case of Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at
Middlebury College in Vermont.</LD>
<LD>   Choephel, 34, was released on medical parole from a prison in Sichuan
province. He flew from Beijing to Detroit, then on to Washington, where
he was met at Reagan National Airport by Lodi Gyari, special envoy of the
Dalai Lama, and Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), who had personally
lobbied the Chinese government for Choephel's release.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously they wanted to make an important gesture," Jeffords told
Associated Press. "But whatever, he's out."</TE>
<TE>   In a memo on the release, San Francisco-based human rights activist
John Kamm said: "I am not aware of any Tibetan prisoners who have ever
been released on medical parole, much less sent abroad for medical
treatment. No Tibetan prisoner has been released into the custody of the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Kamm, who had also campaigned on Choephel's behalf, said he was
informed by Chinese officials that Choephel's release represented a "test
case" in human rights cooperation between the United States and China.</TE>
<TE>   Choephel's case was on a "list of concerns" presented to Beijing by
U.S. officials before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited China in
July. His case was also discussed in October.</TE>
<TE>   Although the release was apparently timed to improve ties with
Washington ahead of Bush's Feb. 21-22 visit to China, Kamm said Chinese
officials informed him Dec. 17--before the visit had been publicly
announced--that Choephel was likely to be freed.</TE>
<TE>   Choephel, a native of Tibet, entered the region from India in 1995
saying he intended to videotape traditional Tibetan music and dance. He
was detained several months later, and in December 1996, he was convicted
on charges of espionage and spreading counterrevolutionary propaganda. He
was sentenced to 18 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Kamm said Choephel was released under a Chinese prison regulation that
allows for medical parole of inmates who have served part of their
sentences and have become ill in prison. China has previously released
political prisoners on medical parole as concessions to international
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Kamm said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who had met with
Jeffords about Choephel's case in 1999, when he was ambassador to the
United States, informed the Vermont congressional delegation that
Choephel had bronchitis, hepatitis and a pulmonary infection.</TE>
<TE>   Choephel plans to seek medical treatment in the U.S., Kamm said, then
return to India, where his mother lives in exile.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A helicopter from Bosnia's NATO-led peacekeeping force crashed into
the Adriatic Sea, killing a French soldier and injuring two others,
military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Gazelle helicopter with three crew members on board crashed near
the Croatian coastal town of Kardeljevo, about 20 miles from the Bosnian
border, a statement said. Croatian fishermen had alerted authorities to

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Britain asked the United States on Sunday to explain photographs
from the Guantanamo Bay prison that show Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners
kneeling on the ground in handcuffs.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Jack Straw sought the explanation after the photos
were prominently displayed in British newspapers and on television. He
said he was awaiting a report from a team of British officials visiting
the prison at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The Mail tabloid ran the headline "Tortured" over one of the photos,
asserting that the pictures "show use of sensory deprivation to soften
suspects for interrogation."</LD>
<TE>   There is mounting concern in Britain about American treatment of the
144 prisoners, three of whom say they are British.</TE>
<TE>   "I have asked our officials in Guantanamo Bay to establish with the
U.S. the circumstances in which these photographs were taken," Straw said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The photographs, released by the U.S. Defense Department, show some
suspects wearing blacked-out goggles and earmuffs. Those kneeling and
handcuffed also had coverings over their mouths and noses and mittens on
their hands.</TE>
<TE>   At the base, U.S. military spokesman Robert Nelson said the photos
were taken shortly after the prisoners arrived from Afghanistan aboard a
C-141 cargo plane.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets pretty cold on a C-141, hence the hat and mittens for
comfort," Nelson said.</TE>

<HD>DNA Proves What Man Long Insisted</HD>
<DH>Crime: Anthony Michael Green, who served 13 years in an Ohio prison
for rape, is still waiting for an apology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>Anthony Michael Green was convicted in 1988 of a horrible crime:
raping and robbing a dying cancer patient. He was sentenced to 10 to 25
years in Ohio's Grafton Correctional Institution.</LD>
<LD>   But he steadfastly maintained his innocence. He refused to enroll in a
program for sex offenders, even though he knew it might improve his
chances for parole. When he came before the parole board in 2000 after
serving 12 years of his sentence, he told them: "You might as well give
me the other 12 years now, because I'm not admitting nothing."</LD>
<LD>   The parole board told him to come back in 30 months.</LD>
<TE>   As it turns out, he was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   DNA tests confirmed it last fall, and he was released. But it had
taken 13 years, the help of a postal worker whom he'd never met and a
group of lawyers from New York City to win his release.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting here with his family recently, in the only home he's ever
known except a prison, the 36-year-old Green folded his hands and said,
softly but determinedly: "An apology. That's what I want."</TE>
<TE>   When Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Anthony O. Calabrese vacated
his sentence in October, Green became the 94th in a parade of convicted
people freed in the U.S. through DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   That number hit 100 last month with the release of Larry Mayes, 52,
from an Indiana prison after 21 years served for a rape he didn't commit.
Some of the cases have led to a dramatic change in the criminal justice
system and given new fuel to the anti-death penalty movement. Illinois
Gov. George Ryan, for instance, placed a moratorium on executions last
year after several death row inmates in that state had their wrongful
convictions overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In the Green case, the nightmare began just after 10 p.m. on May 29,
1988. Someone knocked on an apartment door at the Cleveland Clinic Inn,
where patients stay while being treated at the highly regarded hospital.</TE>
<TE>   A 30-year-old nurse from West Virginia, a divorced mother of one who
was dying of liver cancer, answered. A hand shot inside and tightened
around her throat. Another came up with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant was about 23 years old, she guessed later, 5 feet, 8
inches, 165 pounds. He was black, with a pockmarked face.</TE>
<TE>   He took $42. Then he raped her.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he was drinking with friends that night and had passed out
on his girlfriend's porch.</TE>
<TE>   Green had just been fired from his job working as a dishwasher and
then a maintenance man at the inn. Detectives knew he was familiar with
the building's layout and security.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a clinic security guard thought Green matched the
description of the rapist. He was the same height, weight and race as the
man described by the patient.</TE>
<TE>   He also had a record: a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence,
from a scuffle with his girlfriend. He had been sentenced to a year of
probation. "I was no mama's boy," Green would later say.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the rape, detectives showed the victim five
photographs; one was of Green, taken from his clinic ID card. She could
not identify any of the men as her attacker. A few days after that,
police showed her five more photos, only one of which was a repeat:
Green's. "That's him," she said.</TE>
<TE>Misleading Testimony</TE>
<TE>   Word spread through his tough Wade Park neighborhood, where junkies
hang out by the corner store and churches cover their windows with
plywood and bars. And when Green heard it, he went downtown to clear
things up, offering a blood sample, hair samples, an alibi and the names
of friends who could corroborate at least some of his story.</TE>
<TE>   Police took the samples. Then they read him his rights. At his trial,
the victim took the stand. "That man . . . grabbed me around the throat
and put a knife in my face," she said, pointing to Green.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution had a single piece of physical evidence: a soiled
washcloth left behind by the rapist.</TE>
<TE>   DNA testing was in its infancy in 1988. Indeed, many Americans first
learned of its potential forensic value that same year, when three Hells
Angels, also from Cleveland, were convicted of murder almost entirely on
DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But in Green's case, a Cleveland police criminalist performed a much
more common series of tests on the cloth to determine the blood type of
the rapist, whether he secreted a certain antigen and other biological
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   The criminalist, Joseph Serowick, told the jury that just 14% of black
men could have produced the kind of semen on the cloth. The truth, all
sides now agree, is that about 78% could have produced it.</TE>
<TE>   Serowick also testified that the genetic markers on the washcloth had
been produced by just one person. In fact, it may have contained fluids
from both the attacker and the victim, and all the genetic traits in the
sample that Serowick said pointed to Green could have been produced by
the woman.</TE>
<TE>   Serowick "either knew or should have known" that his report and
testimony were flawed, wrote Edward T. Blake, a leading expert on
forensic DNA, who helped conduct the tests that freed Green. "This entire
line of proof misled the jury."</TE>
<TE>   Serowick declined to comment for this report.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGinty, the lead prosecutor in the case and now a county judge,
built his closing argument around the flawed serology and the victim's
identification. McGinty said recently that he had requested a copy of the
report but had not yet received one and could not comment about it.</TE>
<TE>   When the guilty verdict was read, Green called to the jury: "I didn't
do this!"</TE>
<TE>   As his appeals were denied, Green earned his high school diploma. He
became a certified motorcycle mechanic and CPR instructor, and began
learning Braille and translating social studies texts and Bibles for the
blind.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, nine years after his conviction, Green decided to try to free
himself. He began by quizzing an inmate who knew about a program that had
helped free the wrongly convicted through DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1992 by attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, the
Innocence Project at New York's Cardozo School of Law has helped with
more than half of the cases overturned through DNA evidence. The work of
the project's law students and handful of attorneys has prompted the
launch of about 20 similar programs in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Green began writing letters to the project. He also sought help from a
very unlikely source, Robert Mandell, the stepfather whom he had never
met.</TE>
<TE>   Mandell, a gregarious man with a biting wit and big handshake, was an
odd choice for at least one reason: He was entirely convinced of his
stepson's guilt.</TE>
<TE>   A now-retired maintenance supervisor at the main post office in Akron,
Ohio, Mandell had met Green's mother in 1994 and married her in 1996.
Annie Mandell had tried to help her son over the years but couldn't
convince attorneys that Green's was a cause worth pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'Honey, all mothers think their children are innocent,' "
Mandell said.</TE>
<TE>Stepfather Comes to Aid</TE>
<TE>   But Green persisted, viewing his stepfather as a potential ally.
Mandell knew a bit about the law, and to Green, he had the most important
credential of all: He was on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Green begged Mandell to at least read the trial transcript. His
stepfather finally agreed, mostly out of a sense of duty to Green's
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "The testimony runs to 500 pages," Mandell said. "I got about halfway
through and I said: 'Hey, he didn't do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   There were problems with the description of the assailant: The victim
had said his face was pockmarked by acne, but Green's is smooth. Also,
Green's alibi witnesses never testified. Most were young men with
outstanding warrants who were afraid to show up in court.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1997, Mandell, who still had not met his stepson, began
spending nearly all his free time playing sleuth.</TE>
<TE>   "That case had so many holes in it, it was a shame," he said.
Exploiting them, however, would be an excruciatingly slow process.</TE>
<TE>   Mandell studied Green's failed appeals. He tracked down police files,
detectives' notes, the photo lineups. Students and attorneys from the
Innocence Project offered legal advice. They also told him he had to find
that washcloth. Without it, there was no DNA to test.</TE>
<TE>   After months of pressuring the police to find it, Mandell learned that
it was still sitting in a dank evidence storage room in the basement of
the Cuyahoga County Courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   It took the Innocence Project a year just to review and accept his
case. Months more were spent filing requests to study the washcloth,

<TE>   Last spring, authorities finally gave the go-ahead to send DNA samples
to the lab. Mandell paid about $6,700 for the tests with money from his
pension--money, he said recently, smiling at Green, he expects to see
again.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the results came back.</TE>
<TE>   "The tests were so clear-cut that once you saw Michael's DNA and the
perpetrator's DNA, the perpetrator might as well have been from another
planet," said Elizabeth Kelley, one of Green's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 9, after prosecutors tested Green once more to make certain
the exonerating DNA was really his, the doors opened at the Cuyahoga
County Jail and Green walked through them and into the arms of his
stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next week, he took out the trash, went to his stepfather's
retirement party and called a girl he'd had a crush on for 25 years; she
said yes when he asked her out. He began planning his new life, trying to
decide whether to set up a Braille translation business or become a
corrections officer, and attempting to clear his name from state records
that continued to list him as a convicted felon.</TE>
<TE>   There was one more thing to do, however, to make it official.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, he returned to the courthouse for Judge Calabrese to
vacate his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you restore those years that you spent in prison?" Calabrese
said. "Maybe only God can answer that question."</TE>

<HD>Public Scrutiny Dries Up Special Interest Cash Flow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As reporters systematically uncover the links between Enron Corp.,
its accountants and virtually every politician with a pulse, the
multiplying connections can obscure as much as they reveal.</LD>
<LD>   In many quarters, the story is being portrayed as a simple morality
tale of how money corrupts politics. Yet the lesson of Enron's experience
in Washington is more complex. Money always matters, but it matters most
when the press and public are not watching the decisions money is meant
to manipulate. If there's a wake-up call here for politicians, there's
also a ringing alarm for reporters and voters to pay more attention to
what their government does. Because, more often than not, such public
scrutiny is the only offset to the power of special interest cash.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign reform advocates often act as if the way to understand
everything that happens in the capital is to just follow the money. But
money is only one of several ingredients that produce decisions in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Ideology, and yes, even principle, matter at least as much. So do
electoral calculations. Big donors win more than their fair share of
political disputes. But when a problem provokes an unambiguous public
demand for action, even the most powerful contributors and supporters can
get rolled.</TE>
<TE>   If contributions were always the decisive weapon in political
arguments, there would be no Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, no Food and Drug Administration, no Clean Air Act, no
Medicare (which the medical industry adamantly resisted), no ban on
assault weapons and no fair lending laws. Each time, well-heeled interest
groups resisting changes were abandoned by politicians who feared
disappointing an engaged public.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened to Enron last summer. For months, Enron's
opposition helped block price controls on the wholesale electricity sales
that had become an important profit center for the company. But when
soaring power prices in the West generated enough outrage to prompt
Congress to begin seriously discussing controls, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission reversed itself, swallowed its deregulatory
instincts and approved the caps.</TE>
<TE>   It's when the press and public aren't watching that money really
talks. The Enron scandal illuminates this basic truth of Washington life:
the more obscure the issue, the greater the leverage of special
interests. Put another way, there's an inverse relationship between the
amount of public and press attention a Washington decision attracts and
the ability of special interests to shape the result.</TE>
<TE>   Over and again, the Enron story underscores this point. Today, many in
Washington consider the Andersen accounting firm's dual role as auditor
and management consultant for Enron an inherent conflict of interest. But
that conflict didn't seem so obvious when the Securities and Exchange
Commission tried to ban such double-dipping toward the end of the Clinton
administration. The accounting industry mobilized a huge campaign against
a proposal by then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt to bar accounting firms
from auditing and consulting for the same clients.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, USA Today revealed that at least 50 members of Congress
wrote the SEC in 2000 opposing the rule. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), the
Senate Banking Committee chairman, wrote to complain that "adoption of
the proposal could result in a wholesale overhaul of the accounting
profession." Democratic Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Evan
Bayh of Indiana piled on too.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those most aggressive in denouncing the Enron scandal
today--such as Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the powerful
House Energy and Commerce Committee--were most insistent on blocking
Levitt then. "There is no evidence set out in the [SEC's] rule proposal
that even suggests that there is a problem caused by a broad scope of
services, let alone a problem that needs to be addressed right now,"
Tauzin wrote of Levitt's initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe all these legislators genuinely believed the SEC proposal was
government run amok. But their fervor may have been at least somewhat
stoked by the $53.4 million that, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, the accounting industry has contributed to candidates for
federal office since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over the SEC proposal proved no contest. Almost all of the
pressure came from the accounting industry and its allies; with the press
paying little notice, there wasn't enough public engagement to offset the
industry muscle. The result was predictable: Levitt was forced to back
down, and Andersen was free to wear two hats at Enron. Only now, with
Enron's fall, is the SEC facing calls to reconsider (from Tauzin, among
others).</TE>
<TE>   A similar dynamic drove Enron's success at virtually exempting from
government oversight its lucrative business in trading contracts to
supply electricity. Today, reporters are crawling over that history,
particularly the role played by Gramm and his wife, Wendy (the former
head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who later joined Enron's
board), in carving out that exemption.</TE>
<TE>   But when the critical decisions were made--at the commodity commission
in 1993 and in Congress in 2000--hardly anyone noticed. Less attention
meant more clout for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Scandals change the balance of power on these obscure but critical
decisions by widening the circle of interest. For politicians, siding
with the demands of a special pleader suddenly carries not only benefits
(campaign contributions) but costs (voter doubts about your allegiance).
To stand with Enron now is to stand against workers and retirees who were
financially crippled by the firm's collapse. That makes the money less
persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   In that way, scandals have played a cleansing role, propelling reforms
otherwise unlikely to overcome special interest resistance. Enron now
looks like a financial Love Canal: a crisis that makes practices long
tolerated suddenly unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   But as Enron's retirees can testify, there's a price for delaying
reform until scandal occurs. The better answer is greater public scrutiny
of legislative and regulatory favors for special interests. Lots of
people and institutions failed in the Enron mess. A distracted press and
public were among them.</TE>

<HD>Enron Collapse Blamed on Economics</HD>
<DH>Probe: Andersen chief asserts that the auditor saw nothing illegal
in the giant energy trader's accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Under attack for his firm's role as auditor of Enron Corp., the
chief executive of Andersen said Sunday that he was unaware of any
instance in which the energy giant broke the law, and he sought to focus
blame for Enron's collapse on its business model rather than its dubious
accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing that we have found that was illegal," said Joseph F.
Berardino. "People want to focus on the accounting, and I think that's
fair game. But a company has failed, and it's failed because the
economics didn't work."</LD>
<LD>   Berardino's remarks on NBC's "Meet the Press" came as the accounting
firm itself has become the focus of multiple investigations based on
revelations that Andersen's Houston office destroyed documents on Enron
in the midst of a federal securities probe.</LD>
<TE>   Berardino also has been asked to appear before a House panel that has
scheduled a hearing Thursday on Andersen's document shredding.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Berardino's remarks Sunday, Ken Johnson, a spokesman for
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said: "We're hopeful that he
will come before our committee and tell us the same story--under oath."</TE>
<TE>   Enron, a Houston-based energy company, was a Wall Street darling
before its sudden collapse last fall amid questions about its byzantine
accounting practices. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and much of
their retirement savings, which were heavily invested in Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   The debacle has ensnared Washington because Enron's officers,
directors, employees and political action committee contributed almost $6
million to candidates in both major parties during the last decade,
though most of its largess went to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, had close ties to President
Bush. Company executives sought help from several government officials,
including Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don
Evans, as it sank toward its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The White House appears to have rebuffed Enron's pleas for help. But
Vice President Dick Cheney or members of his staff did meet with Enron
executives several times last year while crafting the administration's
controversial national energy plan. Administration officials also
intervened last year with officials in India in an effort to help Enron
salvage a $2.9-billion deal on a power project there.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Sunday that although he was
not involved in that intervention, the U.S. government routinely provides
assistance to American businesses in disputes with foreign governments.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing inappropriate with those contacts" with India,
Powell said on "Fox News Sunday." "Why shouldn't the American government
try to help one of its companies that is having difficulty with a foreign
government?"</TE>
<TE>   Eager to distance themselves from the scandal, many lawmakers in
Washington, including Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), have pledged to donate contributions they
collected from Enron to a fund established to help the company's laid-off
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has recused himself from a Justice Department
investigation of Enron because of political contributions he received
from the company for his 2000 Senate campaign. There also have been calls
for Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, to do the same because Andersen was among his legal clients
before he joined the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt brushed aside that suggestion Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this is guilt by occupation," he said on ABC's "This Week."
"In my view, the fact that I've had extensive experience and understand
the issues makes me well qualified to solve them."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, one of the country's largest accounting firms, was fired by
Enron last week. Andersen has seen its reputation tarnished significantly
by the Enron scandal. The Chicago-based company, until last year known as
Arthur Andersen, has been criticized for approving accounting practices
that enabled Enron to use hundreds of partnerships to hide debt or
generate questionable profits.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have accused Andersen of overlooking problems at Enron
because it was a lucrative client. One internal Andersen e-mail uncovered
by investigators shows that the accounting firm believed that revenue
from Enron "could reach $100 million per year."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a lot of money," Berardino acknowledged Sunday. "But we're
also a $10-billion organization. This client was less than a fraction of
1% of our fees."</TE>
<TE>   Berardino said he believes the Enron scandal does not pose a threat to
Andersen's survival.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're finished at all," he said. "Our clients know what
we really stand for, and our clients are standing by us because we do
great work."</TE>
<TE>   Berardino did not indicate whether he would agree to appear Thursday
before the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee,
although he said he will testify "whenever that's appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the committee spokesman, said the panel would allow Berardino
to designate another company executive to appear on his behalf. Others
expected to appear before the subcommittee include David Duncan,
Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, whom the accounting firm
fired last week for his alleged role in ordering the shredding of
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the subcommittee also expects to hear from Nancy Temple,
an Andersen attorney who wrote a memo instructing company employees to
preserve Enron documents--but not until Nov. 10, nearly three weeks after
Enron disclosed it was the target of an SEC probe.</TE>

<HD>Laura Bush's Red Gown Is History</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>First Lady Laura Bush's inaugural gown became a historical artifact
Sunday when she donated it to the Smithsonian's National Museum of
American History.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly one year after her husband took the oath of office, leading
her to nine inaugural balls and into the White House, Bush turned the
sequined red dress over to the museum. She kept up a tradition dating
back to Helen Taft, whose husband, William Howard Taft, was sworn in as
president in 1909, and who later donated her gown.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, the museum obtained 13 first ladies' inaugural
ensembles, dating back to one worn in 1881 by Lucretia Garfield and those
worn by Bush's mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure that this dress holds many memories for you. Now it will
become part of the country's collective memory," Marc Pachter, acting
director of the museum, said at a dedication ceremony. The dress was on
display next to him.</TE>
<TE>   The gown and matching coat, shoes and handbag will be displayed as
part of the museum's presidential exhibit, alongside one worn to George
Washington's inauguration in 1789.</TE>
<TE>   "As I look at Abigail Adams' leather embroidered shoes, I realize what
an awesome responsibility it is to fill the shoes of first lady," Bush
said, referring to the wife of the second president, John Adams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm particularly interested in the lives of the women who wore these
gowns--women who raised families, who counseled their husbands, who lived
through war and peace in our beautiful White House," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and the new president crisscrossed Washington the snowy night of
Jan. 20, 2001, appearing for brief dances and speeches at a whirlwind of
black-tie balls. Her dress was made of brilliant red Chantilly lace and
silk satin with crystal beading.</TE>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Passengers on a flight from Britain to Florida aboard a Virgin
Atlantic Airways plane said Sunday they were asked to give handwriting
samples after a bomb threat scrawled on a bathroom mirror diverted the
jetliner to Iceland.</LD>
<LD>   Police found no explosives on the Boeing 747 and concluded that the
threat was a hoax, said Jonas Jonasson, police section leader in
Keflavik, 30 miles southwest of Reykjavik, Iceland's capital.</LD>
<LD>   Jonasson said questioning of the passengers and crew had not turned up
any information on the source of the threat. He said passengers would be
questioned by U.S. authorities in Florida, where they arrived Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   The plane took off from London on Saturday with 322 passengers and 18
crew members bound for Orlando, but it landed at Keflavik overnight after
the crew found the threat and anti-American messages.</TE>
<TE>   Keflavik Police Commissioner Johann Benediktsson has said the threat
was written in soap on a mirror in a plane restroom.</TE>
<TE>   "It contained the phrase 'all Americans must die' and other
anti-American sentiment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The most nerve-racking part was when the captain told us there was a
threat against the aircraft and we had to sweat it out 90 minutes as we
flew back to Iceland," said Steve Wilkins, a 38-year-old passenger from
Sarasota, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins said the plane was met in Iceland with armed security, and
passengers were taken to a hangar by buses. After they were patted down
and their bags were searched, each passenger was asked for a handwriting
sample.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase to be analyzed: "Ask Karl the question. Are Amerikans
really happy?"</TE>
<TE>   Passengers said the people on board remained calm. But several
passengers said they were nervous on the return flight to Florida because
the offender probably was still on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was absolutely petrified, but everyone was also very calm,"
said Allyson Smith, 37, a tour operator from London.</TE>

<LD>The bankruptcy of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric could soon cost the state
its regulatory control of a precious asset--tens of thousands of
Sierra acres and hundreds of miles of river and reservoir shore that
are part of the utility's hydropower system.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E, the state's largest utility, shocked Gov. Gray Davis last
April by voluntarily filing for bankruptcy. True, energy companies
had refused to sell the firm any more power because PG&amp;E was out of
money. But the San Francisco-based company abruptly rejected efforts
by Davis to negotiate a state rescue plan to keep the firm from going
into bankruptcy. Shortly after that, Davis announced an agreement to
save Southern California Edison from forced bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E was thumbing its nose at state officials and at a deal it
deemed not good enough. Today, PG&amp;E remains at war with the
state--specifically the state Public Utilities Commission. The
struggle involves PG&amp;E's reorganization plan, which could put at
future risk some of the state's finest natural assets.</LD>
<TE>   The PG&amp;E plan would require that federal bankruptcy Judge Dennis
Montali override state laws and regulations to implement it; a ban on
selling generating plants would be among the provisions lifted. The
company would transfer its huge hydropower system, valued at more
than $3 billion, to a new subsidiary that would not be subject to
state public utility regulation. PG&amp;E says the spinoff would allow it
to obtain much of the new financing it needs to pay off its debts,
estimated at $13 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The state has a strong interest in the vast system of dams,
tunnels and powerhouses up and down the Sierra range. Stream flows
from dammed areas affect irrigation districts, whitewater recreation,
fish populations and more. Dam safety is a constant concern. The
company has been a good steward of its forest lands, but the next
owner could face heavy pressure from logging companies.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E insists that the hydro system would be operated essentially
as it is now under a 12-year contract. But there's no guarantee that
the subsidiary would have as much regard for forests, wildlife
habitat or recreational users. At the end of the 12 years, the hydro
system could be sold and the pressure to exploit resources would be
even higher.</TE>
<TE>   There was a serious effort in the Legislature during the past two
years to buy the hydro system from PG&amp;E. It failed because PG&amp;E even
then wanted to transfer hydropower to an unregulated offshoot so it
could charge market rates.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC is preparing an alternative plan that would not allow the
hydro system spinoff. PG&amp;E officials insist that the PUC plan would
not pay off all the debt. Lawmakers therefore should consider a new
proposal for state purchase of the hydro system. It's a moneymaking
asset that the state would have great interest in conserving, a good
deal all around.</TE>
