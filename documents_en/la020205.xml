<HD>She's Loving This Stage of Her Life</HD>
<DH>Theater* Ann-Margret is happily touring in 'The Best Little
Whorehouse,' opening tonight in O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Variety was the spice of televised life in the 1960s and '70s, and
Ann-Margret was among the hottest flavors on the tube as she strutted
her sex appeal and her talents as singer, dancer and actress in a
number of TV specials. The titles included "From Hollywood With
Love," "When You're Smiling," "Ann-Margret Olsson" (her birth name),
"Ann-Margret Smith" (her married name) and "Rhinestone Cowgirl."</LD>
<LD>   Variety as a televised genre may have all but vanished, but not
Ann-Margret, who turns 61 in April. Last February she made her stage
debut as the name above the title in a touring revival of the 1978
Broadway musical, "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas." Her role as
Miss Mona Stangley, the pragmatic but principled madam of the Chicken
Ranch, brings her to the Orange County Performing Arts Center for a
one-week run beginning tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer, while performing "Best Little Whorehouse" in Houston,
Ann-Margret after her curtain calls adjourned to the same recording
studio where the Big Bopper cut "Chantilly Lace." Over several
nights, she laid down vocals for her first album of gospel songs.</LD>
<TE>   "God Is Love: The Gospel Sessions" was released last fall on Art
Greenhaw Records, a tiny custom label out of Mesquite, Texas. Sales
have been scant, says owner Greenhaw, but the album has been
nominated for a Grammy and a Dove Award, the highest honor in the
Christian music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Life for the Swedish star has been strewn with obstacles. Among
them are a fight with alcoholism in the 1970s, infertility, her
parents' initial coldness toward her husband, former TV star Roger
Smith ("77 Sunset Strip"), Smith's ongoing illness with myasthenia
gravis (an immune-system disease that causes muscle weakness) and
Ann-Margret's own susceptibility to bone-breaking accidents--among
them a life-threatening fall in 1972 from a 22-foot-high platform
during her Las Vegas nightclub act.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, Ann-Margret debuted as Miss Mona with her left wrist
in a cast. She says she was trying to coax one of her six cats into
her Beverly Hills home on Christmas Eve, 2000, when she caught a
high-heeled shoe on a walkway and fell. She was still mending when
the tour began in Wallingford, Conn., and designer Bob Mackie had to
slit the sleeves of the gowns he had fashioned for her.</TE>
<TE>   "People will say, 'Break a leg.' I say, 'Ooh, I don't usually say
anything like that,'" Ann-Margret said from a tour stop in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Margret says she is delighted with the tour--"knee deep and
loving it"--as she approaches her 300th performance as Miss Mona. The
40-city trek continues through mid-May, and Ann-Margret said she is
mulling a contract renewal to extend it several months. It is the
most sustained role of her career. Other memorable moments include
her star-smitten teen in "Bye-Bye Birdie," Elvis Presley's love
interest in "Viva Las Vegas" and Oscar-nominated turns as Jack
Nicholson's troubled girlfriend in "Carnal Knowledge" and the titular
deaf-dumb-and-blind-boy's mother in "Tommy."</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Margret says she had turned down past offers to star in
musicals. This time was different. She liked the part, and Smith, who
has guided her career since they wed in 1967, was eager for her to
take it and felt well enough to travel with her. The actress says
constant togetherness has been the linchpin of their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not have a relationship if I would be apart from the
person," Ann-Margret said. "So many people say, 'How does it work,
being together night and day?' It works and we don't analyze it."</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Margret has been in films of plays and musicals, including
"Bye-Bye Birdie." Gary Sandy, the veteran stage actor (and former
"WKRP in Cincinnati" cast member) who plays Miss Mona's romantic
interest, thinks she quickly mastered live theater.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not looking at the audience as you would if it were
Ann-Margret doing her nightclub act in Las Vegas," Sandy said from
Denver. "She had to begin to realize that they're looking in on
something and we're not supposed to know they're there. There's a
certain technique behind that, and after a short period she began to
figure that out."</TE>
<TE>   Some reviewers think Ann-Margret has not translated very well to
the stage. "I'm a fan and admirer of Ann-Margret, but I have to
report that she is merely OK," wrote Douglas J. Keating in the
Philadelphia Inquirer. Nelson Pressley of the Washington Post praised
her "presence" and "soul" but complained that "Ann-Margret doesn't
act as much as present herself ... there needs to be more to this
stage version of Ann-Margret than an intriguing presence and a flair
for glamour." For her part, Ann-Margret says she hasn't read her
reviews since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   She laughed when asked whether she saw any contradiction between
singing gospel on CD and playing a whorehouse madam on stage. As the
poster for "The Best Little Whorehouse" makes clear, sexiness is
still her trademark. It shows Ann-Margret draped in the folds of a
bedsheet as she lounges atop a perhaps not-so-lonesome Lone Star of
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds really strange," she said. "But [the religious
side] is a part of me that I have not had a chance to show. I've
always believed in the Lord, and I really felt good being able to
express myself that way."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Greenhaw says he has been an Ann-Margret fan since "Viva
Las Vegas" 38 years ago. Along with the obvious sensuousness, he said
in an interview, he also found a spirituality in her performances.
That was confirmed when he read her 1994 autobiography, "My Story."
Greenhaw, a member of the gospel group the Light Crust Doughboys,
wrote some religious songs for Ann-Margret and sent them to her
manager last year. He suggested she perform them with backing from
his group and from the legendary harmony ensemble the Jordanaires.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed, and sessions were scheduled for last June in Dallas.
The day before the first session, Ann-Margret's mother, Anna Aronsson
Olsson, died in Los Angeles at age 82. Recording was postponed for
several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   She says her mother's death brings deeper meaning to the gospel
CD, her first new album in about 20 years. "[My mother] was so
excited about it and so interested in it, so it made me feel good to
honor her with it."</TE>
<TE>   Ann-Margret is not planning for future roles or thinking about
taking this show to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "I never look into the future or back. As someone who has had a
lot of accidents and gone through some things, I just want to live
right now. I feel really blessed."</TE>

<HD>Effectively Rounding Out Harold Pinter and His Pauses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON BRAUNAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--Directing a Harold Pinter play in the round is a tough
assignment. Karen Carpenter, recently named associate artistic
director for the Globe Theatres, shows her mettle with just such a
challenge in the Globe season opener. Her staging of "Betrayal" in
the intimate Cassius Carter manages to keep matters engrossing while
preserving the famous Pinter pauses.</LD>
<LD>   It helps that the script is one of Pinter's best, the
time-shuffling deconstruction of a love triangle comprising a wife,
her husband and his longtime best buddy. Still, the Pinter-esque
pitfalls are many. An in-the-round axiom calls for keeping the cast
in motion so no actor has his or her back to any segment of the
audience for too long. Yet Pinter has his characters carry on
repetitive, sometimes mundane conversations punctuated with long
silences during which they do nothing but look at--or away from--one
another.</LD>
<LD>   Carpenter has struck a generally effective balance. Except for a
couple of first-act scenes in which the hesitations last about two
beats too long, the nonverbal moments add tension or vivify the
awkward instances when nothing seems right to say. And when the
script places a character in a chair or bed, Carpenter goes with it,
not devising any artificial movements.</LD>
<TE>   All this, of course, could lead to tedium with a less-involving
plot or a less-capable cast. But Pinter's end-to-beginning story
remains fascinating in its reverse revelations, and Pamela J. Gray,
Christopher Randolph and Daniel Freedom Stewart deftly modulate their
personifications Dimiter D. Marinov, in a one-scene showcase, does a
nice turn as an Italian waiter with attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Scenic designers often say that you should be able to look at a
set and understand the play, and Robin Sanford Roberts' set succeeds
admirably. At the beginning, a giant wooden cube rests in the center
of a hardwood floor. Then the cast comes out and proceeds to
disassemble it like a puzzle, with each piece becoming a geometric
piece of furniture. It perfectly illustrates what's to come, the
systematic dismantling of all the relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron M. Copp's lighting ranges judiciously from subdued to
spotlighting and projects the time and location to introduce each
scene. The projections help in following the nonlinear action. Sound
designer Paul Peterson provides appropriate background noises and
between-scenes music heavy on melancholy strings, and Charlotte
Devaux-Shields dresses the central trio in mostly conservative
versions of the styles of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   This production comes at a propitious time. With the recent news
from London that the 71-year-old Pinter is battling esophageal
cancer, it's a chance to savor his greatness and offer a hope that
his work is not yet done.</TE>
<TE>   "Betrayal," Cassius Carter Centre Stage, Balboa Park, San Diego,
Tuesdays through Fridays, 8 p.m., Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m., Sundays, 2
and 7 p.m. Ends March 10. $35-40. (619) 239-2255. Running time: 2
hours, 25 minutes.</TE>

<HD>An Oscar Mantra: Press to Excess</HD>

<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was around a gaggle of movie people the other night who were all
talking about the Oscars. That wouldn't be such an odd thing at this
time of year, except for one thing: The awards themselves were
something of an after-thought. Everybody was talking about their
favorite over-the-top Oscar campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, it's Oscar overkill season. And once again, the classy
part of the Oscars--the Academy Awards themselves--is being
overshadowed by the overamped excess of studio Oscar advertising and
publicity. Even given the usual carpet-bombing-style academy
marketing campaigns, this has been a banner year for hype and
negative campaigning. But the most fascinating tug-of-war has been
between Universal and Miramax, which have been in a spitting match
over Miramax's alleged involvement in a campaign to badmouth "A
Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   The behind-the-scenes battle began in late December when a Miramax
Oscar publicist phoned a reporter to tip him off to a piece that ran
in the Drudge Report before Christmas that said gay scenes from
Sylvia Nasar's book "A Beautiful Mind" had been "completely scrubbed"
from the film.</LD>
<TE>   Miramax czar Harvey Weinstein initially apologized to Universal
studio chief Stacey Snider. But the battle has escalated since. Roger
Friedman, who writes a column for FoxNews.com, has repeatedly
attacked the credibility of "A Beautiful Mind" while repeatedly
fawning over Miramax's Oscar contenders. The columns have raised
eyebrows because the columnist has close ties to Miramax, having
edited a pair of Talk magazine Oscar issues and served as a producer
of a documentary that is being distributed by Miramax. (Friedman said
that he reviews movies "based on my feelings, not based on what
studio they're from.")</TE>
<TE>   At Golden Globes time, the New York Post ran a story detailing
Miramax's involvement in phoning anti-"Beautiful Mind" tips to
reporters and an ensuing flurry of phone calls between Universal and
Miramax. Both sides have since denied having any problems, but
believing Universal was somehow behind the story, Weinstein angrily
confronted Snider at a post-Globes party, where he threatened to
retaliate against "A Beautiful Mind," according to eyewitnesses.
Miramax spokesman Mathew Hiltzik said about the incident: "It's a
completely inaccurate third-party account of a private conversation.
Harvey has incredible respect for Stacey Snider and everyone at
Universal."</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the Oscar ads! From the time Oscar ballots went
out Jan. 8 to last Friday, the deadline for ballot submissions, the
two Hollywood trade papers, the New York Times and this newspaper
have been stuffed with ads noisily competing for the attention of the
5,000-odd academy voters. When asked why DreamWorks ran three "Shrek"
ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times every Friday last
month, studio marketing chief Terry Press said: "Because everyone
else ran two." Disney even ran full-page best picture trade ads for
"Pearl Harbor," a movie likely to get about as many Oscar votes as
"Not Another Teen Movie."</TE>
<TE>   The usual critic hosannas have been drowned out by a tidal wave of
blurbs from everyone from George Will, who gushed over "A Beautiful
Mind," to "The Shipping News" author E. Annie Proulx, who shilled for
the movie version of her own book, calling it "a brilliant film I
didn't dream could be made!"</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Oscar nominations won't be announced for another
week, Miramax has been running ads touting "Amelie" as "One of the 5
Best Picture Oscar Nominees!" after first saying, "Premiere Magazine
picks 'Amelie' as:" in smaller type. Twentieth Century Fox has been
touting "Moulin Rouge" to older academy members with kudos from movie
musical giants Stanley Donen and Robert Wise.</TE>
<TE>   And Miramax has been running "In the Bedroom" ads with a blurb
from Vanity Fair society writer Dominick Dunne, who was initially
billed as "one of the most important writers of our time" but by
Friday was demoted to "one of the most respected journalists in
America." In what many view as poor taste, the ad trades on Dunne's
own personal tragedy--his daughter was strangled by her boyfriend
some years ago--to lend authenticity to his praise by having him say,
"As one who has lived the experience, I found the [film's]
astonishing resolution both terrifying and noble."</TE>
<TE>   Still, my favorite Oscar revelation came during an actors'
round-table interview in last week's issue of Newsweek, where "In the
Bedroom" leading man Tom Wilkinson revealed that Miramax had given
him a secret memo "about how to conduct ourselves when talking to the
press about 'In the Bedroom.' There were about 10 things. You're not
allowed to refer to how much the movie cost to make. You're not
allowed to call it 'The Little Train That Could....'"</TE>
<TE>   Miramax wouldn't supply a copy of the memo. But after conferring
with several studio publicity experts, I've assembled my own slightly
exaggerated version of "In the Bedroom" talking points aimed at
director Todd Field and cast members Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek and
Marisa Tomei:</TE>
<TE>   1. Emphasize the emotional core of the story. If asked to discuss
the story line, say this is not a story of vengeance but a story of
redemption. This has worked well in the past, especially when we sold
"The Cider House Rules" as a movie not about illegal abortion but
about personal redemption.</TE>
<TE>   2. Use the film's minuscule budget to position it as an underdog
overachiever: Tell people that "Black Hawk Down" spent more on
catering than we had to shoot our entire film. We're positioning this
film as a "labor of love," so make the point that you passed up far
more lucrative movies for the opportunity to appear in this special
story.</TE>
<TE>   3. Sissy: Don't be afraid to sell the "comeback" angle of your
story. Oscar voters love actors who are survivors, classy veterans
who get rediscovered after years of lower-profile work--just ask
Michael Caine to show you his statuette! Find a way to drop in
stories about your early "pedigree" films like "Coal Miner's
Daughter" and "Missing."</TE>
<TE>   4. Tom: The academy loves its English cousins, so play up all that
Shakespeare repertory you've done. In fact, you might say you were
attracted to this film because the material had so many "reminders of
Shakespeare" to it--don't forget you were in "Shakespeare in Love,"
which did after all win the best picture Oscar, the very model of a
Miramax Oscar campaign. Or let it drop how you and Judi Dench were
talking last week about "how we love being in these brave little
movies across the pond." But always profess a love for things
American. If the interview is at lunch, order a burger and French
fries with lots of ketchup and say, "I'm beginning to feel like a
regular Yank!"</TE>
<TE>   5. Marisa: It's good to gently remind people that you really did
win an Oscar. Just try to avoid actually mentioning the film you won
it for. If people think you were in "Howards End" instead of "My
Cousin Vinny," so much the better. Stress your own comeback saga. You
could say, "I was so young when I won that I really didn't appreciate
how much an Oscar meant--it really means a lot just to be back in
competition again."</TE>
<TE>   6. Todd: It's vital to remind the all-powerful actors branch of
the academy that you are one of them! So talk a lot about what it
means to cross over to the other side of the camera and the challenge
of honoring the work of so many great fellow actors. But the less
said about your own acting career the better; whatever you do, don't
mention that bit part you had in "The Haunting."</TE>
<TE>   7. All of you are adults, but we can't remind you enough: The
media are always watching. So be on your best behavior. It's our
little Russell Crowe Rule: Don't get drunk at critic dinners and
insult the press. Don't belch when you give an acceptance speech. And
whatever you do, if you lose, don't stomp out of the auditorium and
then stay all night with Courtney Love and spend the next six months
having every gossip columnist write about whether you slept with her
or not!</TE>
<TE>   8. If asked about the competition, be gracious--but not too
gracious. For example: Don't say "Moulin Rouge" was "an incomparable
accomplishment." Call it "a sturdy piece of filmmaking." If people
ask you what movie you'd vote for besides your own, please pick one
that's not a potential nominee. In other words, gush all you want
about "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   9. If people ask about Miramax, mention how collaborative Harvey
Weinstein has been on the project. And now that we've cleared up that
misunderstanding over why some of you were booked into the Motel 6
instead of the Four Seasons, please say how the studio has given this
film its unswerving support from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   10. And whatever you do, don't call the movie the Little Train
That Could. Please!</TE>

<HD>'Swingtime Canteen,' a Patriotic Bugle Call</HD>
<DH>The spirit of the actresses helps smooth any rough edges in
a nostalgic look at USO volunteers during WWII that, yes, resonates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes you have to break a promise to yourself. In the case of
this review, that promise was never, ever to observe in print that
any play, musical or other type of theatrical presentation is "all
the more resonant after Sept. 11." Because what isn't?</LD>
<LD>   But then along comes "Swingtime Canteen" at the La Mirada Theatre,
the red, white and blue story of a group of women during World War
II, putting on a USO show in 1944 for the troops in London. Filled
with swing-era chestnuts like "Bugle Call Rag," "Don't Sit Under the
Apple Tree" and a particularly pretty rendition of "I'll Be With You
in Apple Blossom Time." Dripping nostalgia for the Good War on a
stage draped with bunting and American flags. Featuring a lead cast
of five spunky performers, dressed in all-white like some kind of
boogie-woogie angels, who light candles in the dark instead of
succumbing to fear during a blackout brought on by a bomb scare. A
show that asks the audience to sing "God Bless America" at the
end--and they do so, willingly. It's all the more....</LD>
<LD>   OK, it's resonant. But is "Swingtime Canteen" any good?</LD>
<TE>   In some ways, it doesn't have to be. The 120-minute musical,
performed without intermission, is about a group of volunteer
performers from the Hollywood Canteen, each with her own reason for
wanting to go on tour to entertain the troops. They are led by
gracefully aging MGM movie legend Marian Ames (Rende Rae Norman), who
is smarting from four movie flops in a row. Her troupe includes Katie
Gammersflugel (Tami Tappan Damiano), Ames' wide-eyed niece from
Wisconsin; a Rosie the Riveter type named Topeka (Amy Elizabeth
Jones), who plays a mean piano; Roberta Wall as the brash and
man-hungry Jo (on drums) and the sultry and sullen Lilly (Natalie
Nucci), who starts the tour with a bad attitude but ends up part of
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's a show about mostly amateurs warming up for their
first radio appearance, any rough edges--and there are some--seem
only fitting. There are no excuses, though, for the skittish sound
system, which winked out on Nucci while she belted out her sexy solo
from atop the grand piano. What counts is spirit, and in this
production, directed by Alyson Reed and presented by McCoy Rigby
Entertainment, the gals have got it. It's an effective and often
moving blend of the corny and the sweet. In this setting, it's
entirely believable that the group would suddenly find themselves
stepping in for a planned appearance by the Andrews Sisters.</TE>
<TE>   A historical note: The show was written by Linda Thorson Bond,
William Repicci, and Charles Busch. Busch, the author of the plays
"Psycho Beach Party," "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" and, more recently,
"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," is noted for playing as many
roles in drag as out of it. Busch portrayed the role of Jo
off-Broadway in "Swingtime Canteen" in 1995--which may have lent that
production a resonance about which one can only speculate.</TE>

<HD>New Label Aims to Reshape Today's Country Music Mold</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Universal South hunts for acts in a genre that
seems stuck in the doldrums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The joke around the country music capital these days is that the
creative and commercial health of country music is a lot like the
Nasdaq: Things are so low that there's nowhere to go but up.</LD>
<LD>   Album sales rebounded slightly during 2001, but they were still
down 7.4% from 1998, and one major reason was a lack of exciting new
artists. There may be great young talents in town, but they are
operating under the radar.</LD>
<LD>   Locals grumble when they see such "outsiders" as Ryan Adams,
Lucinda Williams and Sheryl Crow nominated in the country vocal
categories in the Grammys, but they had a hard time finding better
vocal performances among pure country artists last year.</LD>
<TE>   Two of the city's most respected record executives of the '90s,
Tony Brown and Tim DuBois, hope to change that. Last month, they
joined forces to form a new label, Universal South, with the aim of
finding that overlooked talent.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the commercial drought: After the gargantuan sales
in the '90s of Garth Brooks and Shania Twain, major labels became
obsessed with finding more artists who can appeal to pop as well as
country record buyers. Many of these pop-leaning artists lack the raw
emotion and character that have been the foundation of country music
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   If you spend a few minutes with industry veterans here, it's easy
to assemble a list of problems, but they mostly revolve around
spiraling budgets that discourage the signing of maverick talents who
don't have the potential to sell half a million records the first
time out. Where it cost about $250,000 to launch a new artist a
decade ago, promotion costs have escalated so much that it now costs
about $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   In forming Universal South, Brown and DuBois are hoping to
sidestep some of the problems that many feel have prevented major
labels from finding and developing the great new acts in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Nashville has done a poor job in recent years of finding the new
stars because if the act is the least bit different, everyone just
runs ... from them because they didn't think they were safe enough
bets," Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   "What we all have to remember is that great new artists are the
ones that are going to be a little bit different, the ones that stand
apart in some ways," Brown adds. "Whether it's Vince Gill or Alan
Jackson or Reba [McEntire], they didn't make it right out of the box.
Garth was turned down by almost every label before someone saw the
magic in him."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who played piano in the '70s on the road with Elvis Presley
and Emmylou Harris, is sitting in his new office in Music Row, just a
block from his old office at MCA Nashville, where as president of the
label he signed and/or produced records for such bestsellers as Gill,
George Strait, Wynonna and McEntire, as well as such critical
favorites as Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle.</TE>
<TE>   DuBois, who is sitting across from Brown, also has a strong music
background. He has written five No. 1 country hits, including 1982's
"She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)" and "Love in the First
Degree." As head of Arista Nashville Records in the '90s, he helped
launch the careers of such country bestsellers as Jackson, Brooks &amp;
Dunn and Diamond Rio.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason labels feel so nervous about putting up $750,000 or so
every time out is that they have to depend on country radio to reach
the masses," DuBois says. "And radio is so conservative these days
that they've driven the music to the middle rather than the edges
because they don't want to take chances."</TE>
<TE>   The pair feel they can be more flexible in signing acts at their
new label because they can cut overhead by maintaining a small staff
and depending on their joint venture partner--powerhouse Universal
Records in New York--to supply additional promotion and marketing
punch when needed. They also believe they'll have greater authority
in sticking with promising young artists who might take a few years
to establish commercially.</TE>
<TE>   "When news of the label began leaking out in December, a lot of
people thought we were going to try to be some alt-country label,"
Brown says. "But we are planning to be a mainstream label. We want to
sign artists who can sell a lot of records, but we also want artists
who are a little edgy and who might take some time to develop."</TE>
<TE>   But is there really great young talent out there?</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be here if we didn't think there was talent out
there," Brown says. "What we need to do is get the kind of artist we
are looking for to come out of the woodwork and say to themselves,
'Hey, man, I think there is somebody in Nashville who might like me.'</TE>
<TE>   "Great artists need to know that. Great artists like Alison Krauss
[who records for the folk-based Rounder Records despite huge offers
from mainstream Nashville country labels] aren't driven by the money.
They are driven by the music. If they don't feel welcome, they don't
come out of the darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Another local joint-venture label, Lost Highway, has already begun
the search for Nashville mavericks. Since beginning its partnership
with the Island Def Jam Music Group, the label has built a roster
that includes such respected figures as Adams, Williams and Robert
Earl Keen. It goes into this month's Grammy Awards telecast with an
impressive 16 nominations.</TE>
<TE>   The Universal South label starts with four country acts, including
acclaimed singer-songwriter Allison Moorer, that Brown brought with
him from MCA Nashville. Like Lost Highway, however, Brown  and DuBois
want to move beyond the borders of country music and sign acts in
other fields, including rock.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we are coming back to the age of the singer-songwriter,
not just in country music, but in all parts of music ... and
Nashville has long been a center for songwriters," DuBois says.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of people here who are journeyman songwriters who
are great strategists who can handcraft a song for an individual
artist and for what radio wants these days, and that's the focus of
the business today.</TE>
<TE>   "But we also have great writers who write something that is honest
and true and heartfelt and touches people in a way that gets them to
go into the store to buy the album and not just listen to it on the
radio. That's what country music needs again."</TE>

<HD>Taking a Long, Loving Look at Short Films</HD>
<DH>TCM this month explores the enduring art form with a
documentary and classics every Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Audiences today plunk down their $9 at the theater to see
commercials, a barrage of previews and a movie. That wasn't the case
in the first half of the 20th century, when the short film was an
integral part of the moviegoing experience.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, short films were so popular they often shared marquee
billing with features.</LD>
<LD>   Frequently, patrons would go to the movies just to see the latest
Laurel and Hardy or Three Stooges short.</LD>
<TE>   Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to movie shorts with a new
90-minute documentary, "Added Attractions: The Hollywood Shorts
Story," premiering on the cable network today.</TE>
<TE>   Produced by Peter Jones ("Sam Goldwyn") and adapted by Leonard
Maltin from his book of the same name, "Added Attractions" takes a
lighthearted look at the history of the medium.</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by Chevy Chase, the documentary features historians,
newscasters and Hollywood personalities who were either influenced by
or appeared in these shorts, including Walter Cronkite, Gregory
Hines, Howie Mandel, Branford Marsalis, Tim Conway and Bob Newhart.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also kicks off a festival of 125 vintage shorts
that will air every Tuesday in February on TCM.</TE>
<TE>   Maltin, who describes himself as a "child of the first TV
generation," grew up watching classic Laurel and Hardy, Little
Rascals and Three Stooges shorts on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "They even used to show silent comedy shorts," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was weaned on this stuff, and it just made me want to see more
and made me want to know more about the people and the films."</TE>
<TE>   The short films ran the gamut from musicals featuring Broadway and
vaudeville performers to Technicolor travelogues, newsreels, sports,
comedies, histories, dramas, serials and war propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Such stars as Robert Taylor, Cary Grant, Judy Garland, Shirley
Temple and Deanna Durbin appeared in short films before making the
leap to features. Short films were also a training ground for
up-and-coming directors. Fred Zinnemann, who won Oscars for directing
"From Here to Eternity" and "A Man for All Seasons," got his start in
short films</TE>
<TE>   Audiences today, Maltin says, can't grasp the importance of these
shorts. "It was such a commonplace part of moviegoing," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to teach a class in the history of animation, and cartoons
are such an irrevocable part of TV now, it is hard to get young
people to fully understand that they were never shown just to kids.
They were part of the movies."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular series of shorts from the early sound era
featured legendary golfer Bobby Jones demonstrating how to play the
sport, sometimes with stars such as W.C. Fields.</TE>
<TE>   "They are gorgeous," Peter Jones says. "They used really great
high-speed photography. It looks very, very advanced for its time,
which it was."</TE>
<TE>   The musical shorts that Warner Bros. and Paramount produced in New
York are in some cases the only filmed records of seminal Broadway
and vaudeville performers.</TE>
<TE>   The singers and comics were at home in front of the camera because
they knew their routines and when to pause for a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "[Producer] Hal Roach told me [that] when he did previews of
Laurel and Hardy films, he would sit with a timer to time the
laughs," Jones says. "Then they would go back and edit the take
longer, so they wouldn't step on the next laugh. So it was almost as
if it were a live performance."</TE>
<TE>   The Dogville Comedies from the early 1930s were perhaps the most
surreal of all the movie shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Created and produced by Jules White, who later produced all of the
Three Stooges shorts, they featured dogs dressed in clothing spoofing
various movies of the day. The dogs looked like they were talking
because the directors gave them peanut butter to eat. Wires kept the
pooches in place.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Robert Lees points out in the documentary that the
quality of the MGM short films was just as high as that of its
features: "What was wonderful about the shorts department was [that]
everybody who was under contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had to work,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   "So if they weren't on a feature, they were on a short. Which
meant we had the best set directors, we had the best cutters, we had
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Maltin is an unabashed Laurel and Hardy fan. But he also has a
soft spot in his heart for the MGM comedy shorts starring acerbic
humorist Robert Benchley.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Benchley was a real hero of mine long before I knew he had
ever appeared in films," says Maltin.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in school, back in the Cro-Magnon era, we studied
humor. We read James Thurber and Robert Benchley. That is when I
first came to Benchley, and when I learned he had done these shorts,
I finally got to see some of them.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a wonderful discovery," he said. "He just makes me
laugh. He almost doesn't have to do anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Added Attractions: The Hollywood Story" can be seen at 5 and 8
p.m. today on Turner Classic Movies. "Robert Benchley Shorts" will be
shown at 6:30 p.m.; Dogville Comedy Shorts at 9:30 p.m. and Bobby
Jones Golf Shorts at midnight.</TE>

<DH>An exhibition at the Huntington mines two of America's
great public collections of British painting.</DH>

<LD>Legend has it that sometime around 1630, at a lavish banquet for
England's King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria, the duke of
Buckingham presented her majesty with an enormous pie, inside of
which a dwarf was hidden. The queen was delighted. Little Jeffrey
Hudson became her constant companion, until the fateful day in 1649
when he killed an adversary in a duel over slurs about his stature
and was banished from the realm. Hudson was captured at sea by
Turkish pirates and sold into slavery. Eventually he escaped and made
his way back to England, where he quietly lived out his life.</LD>
<LD>   And you thought the shenanigans of Britain's current royal family
were odd.</LD>
<TE>   An extraordinary full-length portrait of the regal queen, the
adventuresome dwarf and an impish monkey commands the entrance to a
complex and fascinating exhibition, "Great British Paintings From
American Collections: Holbein to Hockney," which opened Sunday at the
Huntington Library's Boone Gallery. Painted in 1633 by gifted Flemish
portraitist Anthony van Dyck, the 7-foot-tall picture is a sumptuous
display rendered in big chunks of red velvet, blue satin and yellow
brocade--Mondrian for the Baroque era, as it were. The queen is the
elegant epitome of porcelain-skinned serenity, an ideal beauty who
quells the beastly animal nature of the monkey with a simple gesture
from her firm if unobtrusive hand, while Jeffrey, his upturned face
aglow, looks on in radiant admiration.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyck's regal Henrietta Maria bears scant resemblance to a
written portrayal once offered by her husband's niece. Princess
Sophia, quoted in the exhibition's excellent catalog, carefully
described her impression of the queen as "a little woman with long,
lean arms, crooked shoulders and teeth protruding from her mouth like
guns from a fort." Van Dyck, a prodigy who had risen to become chief
studio assistant in Antwerp to Peter Paul Rubens before he was 20,
certainly understood his job as painter to the British court: Create
an opulent Masterpiece Theater that its noble audience would adore.</TE>
<TE>   "Great British Paintings From American Collections" is filled with
remarkable paintings like this one. Its purpose, though, is not
simply to assemble exceptional pictures, but to trace the history of
American collecting in the area of British painting. Most American
museums--especially in the Northeast, site of several of the original
British colonies--have their share of British masterworks. Paramount
among them is the Yale Center for British Art, which organized the
show. The Huntington houses the other of the nation's two great
public collections of this material.</TE>
<TE>   The 20th century is when pre-modern British painting came flooding
into American collections, dominated in the 1910s and 1920s by Henry
P. Huntington and from the 1960s on by Paul Mellon, benefactor of the
Yale Center. That the so-called American Century would define itself
partly by amassing the accouterments of British nobility isn't
exactly surprising. To the victor go the spoils. The exhibition
catalog also notes a sharp turn-of-the-century rise in American
heiresses marrying titled Brits, led by the wedding of the duke of
Marlborough to the daughter of railroad magnate William Vanderbilt.
Paintings provided ancestral foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington's taste went to full-length portraits from the British
Golden Age. When he bought Thomas Gainsborough's "The Blue Boy"
(1770) in 1921 for the headline-making sum of $728,000--that's more
than $7 million in today's currency, adjusted for inflation--it
immediately became the most famous British painting in America. (It
still is.) Together with "Pinkie" (1794), Thomas Lawrence's rather
sticky confection, the picture has been moved from its long-standing
position of honor in the center of the Huntington's main gallery to
the current exhibition--a rare opportunity to examine the famous
figure almost toe to toe. The paint handling is amazing, from the
brooding sky in the distance to the silver lace at the young dandy's
throat.</TE>
<TE>   In the show, "The Blue Boy" is in the company of other exceptional
portrait examples by Gainsborough, as well as by Lawrence, Joshua
Reynolds, George Romney, Henry Raeburn and Gilbert Stuart, the
American expatriate. (Stuart employed a symphony of gray tonalities
to render his thoroughly un-British portrayal of William Grant, who
is casually engaged in the informal pastime of ice skating.) The
assembly is revealing. Two conventional observations are often made
about the cultural history of Britain. One is that literary and
theatrical narrative has been dominant--Shakespeare, Milton, et
al--far surpassing the static imagery of visual art. The other is
that, from Van Dyck onward, the essential genius of British
portraiture has been found in its bravura handling of paint. In the
show, these two conventions come crashing together.</TE>
<TE>   The painterly brilliance of Blue Boy's satin tunic or Pinkie's
gossamer dress, the creamy skin of Reynolds' women and William
Hogarth's grinning children, the florid display of Queen Henrietta
Maria and all the rest become effusive visual evidence of artistic
performance. "The Blue Boy" is a portrait of Jonathan Buttall,
16-year-old son of a wealthy ironmonger, and he's dressed in
luxurious costume from an earlier century, like an actor playing a
role. Yet, a complementary narrative also unfolds in the showy
brushwork, where painting is cast as a riveting theatrical display.</TE>
<TE>   The presentation of sumptuous material like satin and fur was
obviously intended for the satisfaction of the aristocratic patron
(and, later, to the satisfaction of American collectors). But
painting per se is also an integral part of the show the artist puts
on. Artists are performing for their public, and brushwork is the
drama's tracery. Think of the performance as "action painting" in the
Grand Manner--painting as show biz.</TE>
<TE>   The sumptuous Van Dyck tradition got pumped up into florid flash
and theatricalized ostentation, which also characterized the dramatic
animal narratives magnificently rendered by George Stubbs and soon
spilled over into the flickering landscape pictures of John Constable
and Joseph Mallord William Turner (all well represented here). A
societal change had occurred in the 18th century. The birth and
expansion of a middle class created a new market for art, and art
changed in response.</TE>
<TE>   Before, the greatest painters were imported to England, like Hans
Holbein from Germany and Van Dyck from Antwerp. Now, home-grown
talent filled the need. Tellingly, not a single still life--sumptuous
or spare--will be found in the exhibition, until 20th century
abstraction found a use for still life as a structural armature.
Simple images of glassware, abundant food and silver were not enough
to satisfy the new market's tastes. Middle-class patrons wanted their
artists to perform for them, and the animate quality inherent in
pictures of people and nature provided the best vehicle for their
painterly song and dance.</TE>
<TE>   Due to space limitations the show has been trimmed by 17 pictures
from its debut at Yale, which has resulted in the unfortunate loss of
a recent monumental nude by terrific young painter Jenny Saville. A
few omissions are also surprising, such as anything by Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, the intellectual force behind the 19th century
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, as are a few odd inclusions, like a
full-length figure of a quasi-Grecian maiden by obscure Victorian
idealist Albert Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the inclusion of Henry Fuseli's "The Nightmare" (1781), a
haunted picture of an evil incubus astride a sleeping beauty and the
artist's single greatest work, would be reason enough to see the
show. Or Hogarth's luscious double portrait of two noble children
idly torturing a puppy, which gives the lie to our gilded modern
mythology of sunny childhood innocence. Or Stubbs' positively surreal
vision of an African zebra standing stock-still and radiant within a
leafy British woodland. Or John Singer Sargent's sequel to his
scandalously erotic picture "Madame X"--a monochrome, Velasquez-like
portrait of "Mrs. Albert Vickers" (1884), whose lush range of
brooding grays pierced by flashes of white conveys, like fellow
American expatriate Stuart's earlier stunning portrait of the ice
skater, all the quiet drama of a thunderstorm. Or--well, you get the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of terrific paintings will be found among the 64 canvases on
view. The only real misstep is the small, generally weak and
seemingly haphazard selection of 20th century paintings. Modern
British painting is at any rate no match overall for what came
before, and there may be revealing irony in this. As Huntington,
Mellon and other American collectors began buying up British art in
the last century, the mighty power of the marketplace shifted once
again.</TE>
<TE>   Timing was important. Against a backdrop of the movie industry
getting underway in Los Angeles, Huntington began the trend in the
era when mass culture was first consolidating as a force. And Mellon
started collecting around 1960, at the moment pop culture was going
global. That both great collectors should be attracted to an art that
was powerfully theatrical--in subject and in substance--seems apt.</TE>

<LD>   McCartney Embarking on Solo Tour in U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Paul McCartney's long and winding road as a concert performer will
get a bit longer this year with a new solo tour, his first since
1993.</LD>
<TE>   The Drivin' USA tour will kick off in California in early April
and close in New York by month's end with a total of 15
shows--pushing the singer's lifetime concerts well past the 1,700
mark, according to McCartney's representatives. (For those keeping
track, that's approximately 1,400 with the Beatles, 147 with Wings
and 195 as a solo artist.)</TE>
<TE>   The tour was announced Monday, a day after McCartney performed at
the Super Bowl, but no information on dates or cities was released.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there's a Liverpool tribute concert planned for fellow
Beatle and Liverpool native George Harrison, who died on Nov. 29 at
age 58. Money raised from the Feb. 24 show will be donated to cancer
charities.</TE>

<TE>   Super Bowl Delivers Tension--And Viewers</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's Super Bowl, in addition to being a rare nail-biter on the
field, saw an increase in viewership over last year. With an average
86.8 million viewers tuning in at any given minute during the game,
it was up more than 2 million viewers from 2001. An estimated 131.7
million people watched at least a portion of the game.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated halftime showdown between Fox's coverage of a
concert by U2 and NBC's Playboy Playmate episode of "Fear Factor"
failed to materialize, as nearly 83 million viewers stayed on Super
Bowl coverage. The NBC show generated a meager 11.4 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the game ran late, Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle" didn't
begin until nearly 11 p.m. on the East Coast, attracting just 21.5
million viewers. That was less than half the audience that watched
"Survivor" after last year's Super Bowl on CBS.</TE>

<TE>   HBO Shifts Air Date of 'Laramie Project'</TE>
<TE>   It's either one-upmanship or chicken--depending on how you look at
it. After learning that NBC had scheduled a similarly-themed TV movie
for the same night, HBO has changed the date of its movie version of
"The Laramie Project"--an adaptation of Moises Kaufman's play about a
town forced to reexamine itself in the wake of the 1998 murder of gay
college student Matthew Shepard.</TE>
<TE>   The HBO movie, starring Steve Buscemi, Janeane Garofalo, Laura
Linney, Christina Ricci, Frances Sternhagen and Bill Irwin, is now
due to be shown a week earlier--on March 9.</TE>
<TE>   "As we became aware that two films related to the Matthew Shepard
case were scheduled to air on the same date, we felt it important to
move our film to broaden the audience for both projects," Chris
Albrecht, president of HBO original programming, said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, NBC announced that it had tentatively scheduled "The
Matthew Shepard Story," starring Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston,
for March 16--long after the October date for which it was originally
earmarked. When HBO protested, NBC executives said they had no
knowledge of the cable channel's plans and denied it was
counter-programming.</TE>

<TE>   Black Films: Higher Grosses, Little Crossover</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk about diversity, the number of African
American-themed Hollywood films released annually hasn't jumped much
since 1990, according to the Black Talent News Black Film Report.</TE>
<TE>   The total rose from nine in 1990 to 15 in 2001, the report says.
But last year's number was down from the high of 19 in 1997 and 1998.
Total grosses showed a marked rise, jumping from $85 million in 1990
to $214 million last year. The high was $609 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "While black films continue to prove their financial viability at
the box office, tapping into the crossover audience remains one of
the biggest challenges for black films," noted Tanya Kersey-Henley,
the author of the report. "Movie-going audience patterns, much like
television viewership, remains largely polarized along racial lines."</TE>

Broadway when Nathan Lane leaves his Tony-winning role on March 17.</TE>
<TE>   John Barlow, a spokesman for the show, confirmed Monday that
Goodman would be the much-speculated-upon replacement in Mel Brooks'
smash hit, which won 12 Tony Awards last year. Goodman was last seen
in New York in the second replacement cast of Yasmina Reza's "Art."

"Traffic".... President Bush has requested a $117-million budget

<HD>Chorale Matches 'Miserere's' Intensity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The audience applauds. The performer smiles. It is a natural,
probably Pavlovian reaction.</LD>
<LD>   But Sunday night, seated close to the stage of the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, I noticed only a few weak smiles on the faces of
the many singers in the Master Chorale following the performance of
Henryk Gorecki's "Miserere." Most members of the chorus looked
emotionally drained; a few were close to tears.</LD>
<LD>   Written 20 years ago during a period of political oppression in
Poland, "Miserere" is a blunt, powerful, direct, exhaustively
physical expression of the Solidarity movement, which rose to counter
that oppression. Gorecki calls for a very large a cappella chorus, of
at least 120 singers. There are but five words of text. For 30
minutes the chorus sings a subtly varied but harmonically static
chant line on the first three, "Domine Deus noster" (Lord our God).</LD>
<TE>   "Miserere" begins with the deepest basses standing and singing
barely above the threshold of audibility. Then more basses stand and
add a slight variation to the chant at the interval of a third
higher.</TE>
<TE>   As more sections of musicians slowly rise, the music rises too,
each time by a third. It takes 20 minutes for the full chorus to be
on its feet. For another 10 minutes, the chorus continues to sing
"Domine Deus noster," faster, louder, in waves of ardent hammering
and tender imploring, always with unchanging harmony.</TE>
<TE>   The ethereal resolution, as Gorecki finally unlocks the final two
words of the text, "Miserere nobis" (Lord have mercy on us), is a
vocal halo that envelops the hall, a final three heavenly minutes of
ecstatic supplication.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks to the audience, Grant Gershon called "Miserere" one of
the greatest choral works of the past 50 years. The Master Chorale
sang it for him with an intensity, concentration and devotion that
was its own political and spiritual statement.</TE>
<TE>   Gershon, midway through his first season as music director of the
Master Chorale, labeled this concert "Triumphs of the Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   A bit hokey, perhaps, but not untrue.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's other work was Mozart's Requiem, which Gershon
dedicated to the memory of Peter Hemmings. The founder of Los Angeles
Opera gave the conductor his first job out of school.</TE>
<TE>   As if inspired to live up to that promise, Gershon led a
performance that had all the dramatic intensity of opera.</TE>
<TE>   He inspired expressivity from soloists--soprano Susan Montgomery,
alto Tracy Van Fleet, tenor Robert MacNeil and bass Jinyoun
Jang--focus and fire from the Master Chorale Orchestra, warmth and
zeal from his chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the performance, in fact, Gershon reminded us that the
musical language of the Requiem is close to that of "Don Giovanni."
Gershon's exciting and probing reading seemed as though it were a
continuation of Mozart's opera and the Don's defiance and final awe
in facing his death.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart didn't live to finish the Requiem. Usually we put up with
the unsatisfactory ending devised by Mozart's pupil Franz Xaver
Sussmayr.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Levin, the pianist and Mozart specialist, has improved upon
Sussmayr, and Gershon used Levin's recent version. But still the
sense of incompleteness lingers, and perhaps that was the deeper
message of this evening.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit's triumph over oppression and death is an ongoing
struggle. But this is the most important struggle of all, and the
fact that Gershon embraces it with the brave enthusiasm that he does
enriches our musical life.</TE>
<TE>   The Master Chorale is going places.</TE>

<HD>Moyers Takes on NAFTA Provision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to the other Chapter 11.</LD>
<LD>   It's not the Enron variety, but an obscure provision of NAFTA, the
North American Free Trade Agreement, that comes under fire in "Bill
Moyers Reports: Trading Democracy" (10 p.m., KCET).</LD>
<LD>   Chapter 11 is a clause in the 555-page trade accord among the
United States, Mexico and Canada that gives companies the right to
sue foreign governments when laws, or even jury verdicts, threaten
profits. Because these cases are decided by secret tribunals,
opponents call the system "a private court for capital."</LD>
<TE>   In one case, a U.S. company was awarded $16 million when Mexican
officials stopped it from reopening a toxic dump. In another, a
Canadian firm is seeking nearly $1 billion because of a California
ban on the gasoline additive MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 11 supposedly was written to protect investors from
property seizures, Moyers says, but corporations have stretched the
phrase "tantamount to expropriation" to pull what one irate attorney
calls "an end run around the Constitution." Not only could Chapter 11
cost taxpayers billions, opponents say, but it has a chilling effect
on lawmakers considering any move that might crimp profits.</TE>
<TE>   Moyers seems far from objective--even the title suggests where he
stands. Some of the cases he cites dismissively, such as a claim by
UPS against Canada over its subsidized delivery service, would seem
to have at least a semblance of merit on fair trade grounds.</TE>
<TE>   But he makes a potent argument.</TE>
<TE>   Even one U.S. trade official Moyers interviews inadvertently helps
indict Chapter 11. It's a classic "60 Minutes" moment: Charles "Chip"
Roh twists in his chair while trying to explain why the provision
isn't as bad as it sounds, then acknowledges with a chuckle that his
"body English" doesn't look good.</TE>

<HD>Hampson Exudes Poise, Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Hampson had the briefest lapse late in his luminous recital,
Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall, momentarily forgetting a line in an
encore, shrugging it off with a grin. In a way, it was a humanizing
moment, a hint of flaw, in a performance that came off as almost too
ideal. The baritone has a commanding presence, a singer at the top of
his game. An opera star, he also gives art songs authoritative and
sensitive readings.</LD>
<LD>   With Sunday's program split between the music of Schubert and
Mahler, and a second set of strictly American songs, Hampson
demonstrated both his traditional and adventurous instincts. He's
confident enough to be casual, even occasionally down-to-earth,
onstage. At one point midway through the concert's first half, he
noticed texts in the audience and asked that the lights be brought
up, attending to listener comprehension.</LD>
<TE>   Several songs were based on texts of Walt Whitman, from the
rambling slave saga of Henry T. Burleigh's "Ethiopia Saluting the
Colors" to the cerebral miniatures of Ned Rorem's "As Adam Early in
the Morning" and Bernstein's moving "To What You Said." Other
Americana included William Grant Still's jazz-tinged "Grief," the
wistful "Shenandoah" (arranged by Stephen White) and Copland's jaunty
"The Boatmen's Dance." Earlier, Hampson sailed handily through songs
from Mahler's "Des Knaben Wunderhorn," beautifully accenting the
entwined themes of love and battle. Here, as throughout the recital,
pianist Wolfram Rieger played with exactitude and subtlety.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his advocacy of American songs and the desire to unearth
buried indigenous treasures, in one sense Hampson saved the best for
first. His readings of songs from Schubert's "Schwanengesang" proved
the afternoon's early highlight. He expressed a wide, focused range
of Schubertian emotion: melancholic depletion marked "Ihr Bild,"
fragile jubilation in "Das Fischermadchen" and roiling indignation in
"Der Doppelganger," all without ruffling his built-in poise.</TE>

or see their favorite shows. Some friends' VCRs whir.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Sam Jennings has learned a lot about the TV viewing habits of his
friends since NBC changed its local affiliate station on New Year's
Eve. When NBC switched from San Francisco-based KRON to San Jose's
KNTV, tens of thousands of viewers in the northern broadcast area
discovered that they couldn't pick up the new channel--including four
of Jennings' friends, for whom he now videotapes their favorite NBC
shows.</LD>
<LD>   "They're not about to pay for cable to watch 'Will &amp; Grace,'"
Jennings said. "One surprising thing about this whole NBC nonsense is
that I've discovered that people I would never have imagined [to be]
devotees of sitcoms are [fans of these shows]. One friend in
particular wants episodes of 'Just Shoot Me,' which is, in my
opinion, the stupidest thing on the air."</LD>
<LD>   Or not on the air--as is the case for some 145,000 households in
the country's fifth-largest television market, which stretches from
San Jose to San Francisco, where most of the lost viewers are
located.</LD>
<TE>   When NBC switched its affiliation to KNTV after 50 years with
KRON, it did more than change from Channel 4 to Channel 11--it also
switched transmitters from Mt. Sutro in San Francisco to Loma Prieta
south of San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   That meant that homes that could never get the signal in the
southern reaches of the market finally got NBC, but that tens of
thousands of viewers in the north who took broadcast TV as a
birthright suddenly found themselves staring at a screen full of snow
instead of "The West Wing" or "ER."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Must See TV," the San Francisco Chronicle carped, turned
into "Can't See TV" for many.</TE>
<TE>   The timing, too, just before the February ratings sweeps (which
began Thursday) and the Winter Olympics (opening Friday), has galled
many would-be viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel abandoned by NBC," said Michelle La Plante, a law student
in San Francisco, who turned to Channel 4 one day after the switch
and found an infomercial instead of NBC fare.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most viewers have managed to locate NBC. On a recent
Thursday, for example, the network finished second in prime time,
grabbing 14% of the available audience, just behind CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "KNTV is doing remarkably well," said Steve Doerr, NBC senior vice
president for news and programming. "It has exceeded our hopes and
expectations. Four weeks ago no one had even heard of this station.
Now it's No. 1 or 2 in many categories. That's unbelievable. We're
neck and neck with the guys who've been around for 60 years; we've
been around three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Ratings growth notwithstanding, KNTV's news operation has already
been dinged by Grade the News, a Bay Area media watchdog group, which
gave the station a D+ for its local coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "KNTV's newscast was the worst we've ever rated for
newsworthiness," wrote John McManus, on the group's Web site,
gradethenews.org, adding that the station's newscasts "were riddled
with 'Journalism 101' errors you just don't expect to see in the
nation's fifth-largest market."</TE>
<TE>   Move Is Paying Off</TE>
<TE>   Already for KNTV</TE>
<TE>   Affiliation changes remain rare, although there was a flurry of
such activity in the mid-1990s, after Fox boldly convinced a dozen
stations affiliated with the three elder networks to align themselves
with Fox, which had just acquired rights to NFL games.</TE>
<TE>   KNTV, which has seen its prime-time market share jump from 1% to
double digits, certainly seems happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Switches are disruptive," said Bob Franklin, the general manager
for KNTV. "It takes a while for viewers to establish viewing
patterns. It can be months and months before markets solidify. But
the bottom line is that 20 days after the switch, we're No. 1 or 2 in
morning news, the 'Today' show, prime time, late news and late night.
I've been doing this for a while, and I've never seen such an
extraordinary acceptance of a product so soon into a switch."</TE>
<TE>   The machinations behind the channel switch itself sound like the
stuff of a TV miniseries. KRON was born as an NBC affiliate in 1949
and owned for half a century by the Chronicle Publishing Co., which
was controlled by the heirs of the De Young family, who also owned
the Chronicle newspaper. In 1999, the family put the company's assets
on the block.</TE>
<TE>   NBC offered $700 million for KRON--which would have given the
network an owned-and-operated station in the largest market where it
lacked one. But NBC was outbid by Young Broadcasting, which owns KCAL
in Los Angeles among dozens of other independent stations. Young
wound up paying about $737 million in cash and stock for KRON,
figuring it could make money either as a network affiliate or as an
independent--NBC seemed to have no place else to go.</TE>
<TE>   Then KNTV stepped into the picture. The San Jose station had been
a secondary ABC affiliate in the Salinas-Monterey market before it
became an independent in 2000. When NBC and Young couldn't come to
terms over an affiliation agreement, the network decided to go with
Granite Broadcasting's KNTV.</TE>
<TE>   In December, NBC announced that it was buying the channel for $230
million, knowing that the change in transmitters would cause some
viewers to lose the network's over-the-air signal.</TE>
<TE>   "The topography of the San Francisco area compounds the problem,"
said Jay Ireland, president of NBC TV stations. "You have a lot of
dead spots."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why more than 80% of households in the area have cable.
The network, in fact, decided to advertise the station as NBC3 for
its position on the cable dial and joined with AT&amp;T Broadband to
aggressively market cable subscriptions on everything from grocery
bags to billboards. AT&amp;T spokesman Andrew Johnson said cable
subscriptions jumped 15% to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some apartment dwellers still can't get cable, and others
have balked at spending anywhere from $14 a month (just to improve
their broadcast reception) to $35 for basic cable to get a channel
that is nominally free.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to Improve</TE>
<TE>   Signal in Problem Areas</TE>
<TE>   Out of 2.4 million households in the market, NBC says it has
received about 10,000 e-mails and letters complaining about lost
reception. The network has dispatched trucks to prowl those ZIP codes
that are having the hardest time getting NBC to better map problem
areas. NBC is also considering using low-power signal repeaters to
boost reception in certain neighborhoods during the Olympics. .</TE>
<TE>   "If it works, it may give us a permanent solution," said NBC's
Ireland. "We're trying to reach as many viewers as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Moving the transmitter is also being studied. "It's quite possible
we could move it and very quickly," said KNTV's Franklin. "But no
matter where you put the tower, there will always be neighborhoods
that won't get the signal. The south Bay has had to deal with the
lack of reception for stations in the north Bay for 40 years.
Everyone will not be satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   While people in San Francisco who have lost NBC say they're
watching less TV and spending more time reading or listening to
music, some in the south Bay are actually gloating.</TE>
<TE>   "KNTV should resolve to tell the whiny television elitists in San
Francisco they should shut their sourdough yaps," wrote San Jose
Mercury News columnist Mark Purdy, who was just getting warmed up.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks up in the Bay Area's second-largest city complained that
the signal was too weak to pick up there. Awww. Too bad. For years,
we South Bay residents without cable hookups had to twizzle and bend
our outdoor antennas to pick up San Francisco stations. Now it's
payback time, baby. If anyone in San Francisco really misses 'Fear
Factor,' they can always walk outside and confront a few aggressive
panhandlers."</TE>

<HD>A New Lease on Life for an Old Hotel</HD>
<DH>A developer throws himself into creating a new kind of
high-class, low-income housing--and finds it's a bumpy ride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rob MacLeod strides through his mahogany and marble lobby, pointing
out fluted pillars, etched glass, arched windows--stately spaces that
once enclosed gourmet diners and the hottest nightspot in town, the
Zebra Room.</LD>
<LD>   Hope, Crosby, Gable, Grable, John Wayne, Liz Taylor. All were seen
there through the years--dining, dancing, smooching or swimming in
one of L.A.'s first Olympic-size pools, named for Esther Williams
because she splashed there so often.</LD>
<LD>   This historic, 14-story, stone-and-brick structure on Wilshire
Boulevard near downtown was originally a residence for the rich. Then
it was a luxury hotel, operated first by Hilton and next by Sheraton.
Its elegantly proportioned rooms have high ceilings, huge windows,
decorative moldings and other Old World amenities, including a
fireplace in every living room.</LD>
<TE>   When you think of affordable housing for poor families, this is
not the kind of place you might imagine. The city's housing sages
couldn't imagine it either. When MacLeod proposed to rehabilitate the
old hotel for families with low incomes, they belittled the idea.
Poor families are like everyone else, the authorities said. They
don't want vertical housing, no matter how handsome. They want fresh
air, grass, an outside place for kids to play. They won't even apply
to rent apartments in a high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   But MacLeod, a developer, was the only one willing to try and save
the doomed historic structure, so officials decided to give him a
shot. And they soon learned they'd been wrong about the building's
potential. When the office opened for applications, 5,000 people
showed up to rent the 142 newly refurbished apartments.</TE>
<TE>   In December the place celebrated its official reopening, as the
MacLeod Townhouse, with apartments from 900 to 1,400 square feet, and
monthly rents from $400 to $700. It is an experiment in progress--one
that cost about $26 million--and is still controversial. But MacLeod,
dubbed a visionary and an artist by some who've worked with him on
the project, seems to be winning converts.</TE>
<TE>   It all began benignly enough, says MacLeod, 56. He was sipping
coffee at his Malibu beach home a few years back, brooding about his
divorce, looking for something absorbing to do. Things were slow in
real estate that year. MacLeod picked up the newspaper and read that
the Sheraton Townhouse, a once-grand hotel, was doomed. "It was about
to be demolished, literally slated to become a huge parking lot. City
officials and preservation groups were at their wits' end. They
wanted to save the building, but they don't know what to do with
it--or how."</TE>
<TE>   Having been a real estate developer for most of his business life,
MacLeod knew the what and the how, he says. He also knew there was a
tremendous lack of affordable family housing in the neglected center
of the city, especially near Lafayette and Macarthur parks. He could
provide such housing by rehabbing this faltering old hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He knew it wouldn't be easy. But MacLeod isn't a humble guy. He
believed he had the brains, the guts and the deal-making savvy to get
the job done. "I decided to do it as divorce therapy," he says. "If I
knew then what I know now, I might not have gotten involved," he
adds. Now there is no turning back.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Nate Holden, in whose district the Townhouse sits,
admits he was dubious of MacLeod's plan. "I thought you should not
put children in a high-rise. I didn't want them running through the
halls, hiding in elevators, causing havoc because they were cooped up
in a huge building with no fresh air and no place to play. A
high-rise is no place for little children to lead good lives."
Holden's opinion was echoed by others in government and
elsewhere--people who knew that vertical projects in other cities had
become infamous crime-infested slums.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeod knew the old script. But he had newer evidence to the
contrary, he said. Those old-style projects were built with no humans
in mind. There are newer high-rise, low-income buildings in San Diego
and San Francisco that are quite successful. And his would be even
better than those, he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "It will become the premier low-income development in the West--a
place with fabulous, fabulous rooms, dedicated to a fine quality of
life. It will offer amenities unavailable elsewhere, and its good
people and their good vibes will radiate to enhance the entire
Lafayette Park neighborhood. When you put good people in, they drive
bad people away," he still says earnestly, as if quoting Scripture.
He saw it as his chance to do something "challenging and good."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their doubts about vertical housing, bureaucrats in
the city's various offices are not partial to such highfalutin,
self-congratulatory speeches. They were probably especially leery of
the kind of East Coast, fast-talking cowboy who comes driving into
the inner city from his Malibu digs, Jaguar convertible top down,
clothes like well-worn lvy League leftovers--or Ralph Lauren's
faithful reproductions thereof. Some city fathers and mothers admit
they gave MacLeod (a Dartmouth and USC business school graduate) a
hard time--although he was their only hope of saving the huge
building from imminent demolition.</TE>
<TE>   "To let the building be razed would have increased urban blight,
would have further ruined an already deteriorating neighborhood--not
to mention it would have destroyed one of the truly historic
landmarks in our town," Holden says.</TE>
<TE>   Options That Were Unusual in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials were more enthusiastically in MacLeod's corner.
Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Housing Department at
the time and now a developer of affordable housing, says "housing
that's well-managed can work in any configuration." And though
California is dominated by low, garden-style apartments, he says,
"that's not the case in Chicago and Boston, where high-rise
affordable housing has been successful." In addition, Squier says,
with the current density of L.A.'s population, and the even greater
density to come, people with low incomes might never find housing if
only low-rise buildings are built. There just isn't enough affordable
space for the number of people.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Mills, a former finance officer at LAHD and now a vice
president at Wells Fargo, appreciated "the uniqueness of MacLeod's
vision. He offered so many things unusual in urban L.A. housing: the
huge swimming pool, a charter school on site, a complete vision for
how he wanted the place to look and to enhance the lives of tenants.
He did an incredible job with the finishes and the artwork."</TE>
<TE>   If you drive west on Wilshire from downtown, past the many
once-great buildings that now stand unused, past the boarded-up
storefronts emblazoned with graffiti, you might wonder how such
gracious spaces on such a broad and lovely boulevard could be allowed
to fall into dismal disarray. When you get to the Townhouse at
Wilshire and Commonwealth, across from Lafayette Park, and hear
MacLeod's Byzantine tale, you might begin to understand.</TE>
<TE>   The Townhouse and its grounds occupy most of a square block, with
the remainder available for retail use. "The owners wouldn't split
it. You had to buy the whole thing," he says. He put money into
escrow and conceived a plan to transform 255 hotel rooms into 142
apartments, with parking, an on-site day-care center--which
ultimately became a 130-student charter elementary school instead--a
library, a swimming pool, play areas inside and out, an exercise
room, and on the far side of the lot, a separate retail strip that he
planned to include a market, a McDonald's and other stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a risk-taker, but even I knew this was a gamble I might not
win," he says.</TE>
<TE>   First, he had to get financing. None of the multitude of city and
state agencies with money to offer for such things could easily
believe his plan would work. But to seal the deal, he had to win a
series of awards, in quick succession, from an array of governmental
funds.</TE>
<TE>   To get an LAHD residual receipts loan, he had to show plans not
just for the residential part of the project, but for the commercial
as well. This meant finding retail tenants to sign up for this
less-than-ideal location before the project had even begun. Next, he
needed a state low-income housing committee award. "Winning that one
is like winning the lottery," MacLeod says. "But if I did it, I could
sell those housing credits to an equity investor, and the money
derived would help purchase and develop the project." He also had to
win an Affordable Housing Program award and both interim and
permanent financing for the balance of the project not funded by any
of the above.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to win them all. In succession. Not a single piston
could miss, or the whole deal falls apart. If you do the math, your
chance of succeeding might be about 8%," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the odds, he succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   He had no idea, he says, that his agony was just beginning. He
next encountered problems his experience could not have prepared him
for. Construction problems, mostly too complex to describe, were only
equaled by the conflicts among different agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The building, designated a historical landmark, had to be
preserved with absolute accuracy. Take something as seemingly simple
as window screens. The government decreed that MacLeod had to put
screens on every dwelling's windows. The preservationists said that
screens were not historically accurate and that he could not put them
on. The historians won. There are no screens.</TE>
<TE>   Housing authority rules state that all windows must be at least 42
inches from the floor so that babies and other living things do not
fall out. But preservationists said he could not change the original
windows, which were beautifully huge, and which came nearly to the
floor. Ultimately, all windows were fixed to open no more than 6
inches.</TE>
<TE>   Exquisite handmade moldings on ceilings and around apartment entry
doors were in disrepair and had to be restored. But there are no
artisans left who do such delicate, detailed work. MacLeod's team
called three elderly master plasterers out of retirement to get the
job done. The plumbing system was worse than predicted, a trash
disposal system didn't exist, the building needed totally new heating
and air conditioning. The pool had problems not evident at first and
needed all new lighting, heating and everything else.</TE>
<TE>   More troublesome than all this, perhaps, was MacLeod's own
determination to give the building's newest tenants an environment
above and beyond what was required. He commissioned chandeliers
historically accurate in mood and design. He commissioned art not
just for the major public rooms, but for the laundry room and other
unlikely spaces. His painters perfected a color he calls "mud" to
paint wood that imitates the original mahogany.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the work of selecting the tenants. That, too, has
provided more angst than he is willing to admit, says an associate
who worked with him. To qualify for the project, potential tenants
have to earn less than 50% of the median income in the area, MacLeod
says. He hired a management company to screen all applicants' income
statements to make sure they qualified and to check their credit
ratings as well. "We wanted low-income people, but people who pay
their bills." Then he hired a representative to visit each of the
likely candidates at their homes. "We wanted people who take pride in
keeping their places up," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Each potential candidate was told that if they moved into the
Townhouse, they would have to donate time each week to help keep the
property maintained. MacLeod calls this the first "community
management program" in the West. Tenants select from an array of jobs
and committees on which they can work: the guest reception desk, the
landscape and garden committees (there's a rose garden and a tenant
vegetable garden), the hall and trash collection committees, to name
a few. The prospect of work deterred almost no one, MacLeod says. The
apartments were quickly filled, and there is a long waiting list.
About one tenant per month moves out, and the apartment goes to the
next person on the list.</TE>
<TE>   The MacLeod Townhouse started accepting tenants about two years
ago. Still, the kinks are not all worked out--which is why MacLeod
delayed the "grand opening party" until December.</TE>
<TE>   Not All Tenants  Are 100% Pleased</TE>
<TE>   If he's aware of any lack of enthusiasm among some tenants, he
doesn't admit to it.</TE>
<TE>   Informal chats with a few of them reveal that, though they
appreciate the beauty of the building, they're not without
criticisms. "I love the historic aspect of this place and my
apartment," says G. Victor Mann, 40. "You can see the history and
feel it." He also likes his fellow tenants, and the fact that there
is hardly any crime.</TE>
<TE>   But elevators keep breaking down, he says, and he wants MacLeod to
open the exercise room, "where there's lots of equipment but no one's
allowed to use it yet."</TE>
<TE>   Other tenants said they "have no time to work in the building" two
hours a week and repeat that elevators are a big problem. "My husband
was stuck in one for two hours," said one tenant who wouldn't give
her name. Another complained that the parking isn't convenient
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Signs in the well-maintained corridors indicate another problem
for the management: "No smoking in fire stairwells. $500 fine for
violations. All floors are under video surveillance. This is final
warning. No exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   By and large, MacLeod says tenants respect and care for the
building very well. And well they should, says Russ Wyluda, who was
general contractor for the project. He calls the undertaking immense
by any standard. "The Aswan Dam and Staples Center were probably
bigger," he says with a chuckle. "But this was the largest
construction in Los Angeles at the time it started."</TE>
<TE>   He also says it has the greatest infusion of fine design and art
of any affordable project he's ever seen--more even than many
market-rate housing complexes. "What's more, these people have more
spacious apartments than you would find at some very pricey places,
like the Marina City Club," says Wyluda.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants' quibbles are just part of the reason why many a
less-persevering guy would have given up on this project long ago,
some of his awed colleagues say. First, the concept of high-rise
housing for poor families is not yet accepted among urban experts;
MacLeod's project will either help prove or disprove whether it will
work in the long run. Further, his is not a money-making proposition.
Although he says he'll profit from the retail stores not yet in
place, the building is dedicated to low-income families for the next
55 years, which means even his teenage sons won't be able to rent the
Townhouse apartments at market rate--at least not until they are old
men.</TE>
<TE>   No matter; MacLeod seems to love the uncertainties. He maintains
his office at the Townhouse, where he arrives most days around noon.
He spends mornings at his beach properties, he says. He is building
"a few architecturally special" homes along the shore to sell for $2
million to $4 million each.</TE>
<TE>   He says that on good days, his heart is in the center city, with
the Townhouse and its people. On bad days, he asks himself, "Who
needs this?" He can live quite nicely, thank you, without the
aggravation. If things don't go right, he can stop right now, pick up
his marbles and walk away. Not from the Townhouse, but from future
center-city plans he has in mind.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the good days outnumber the bad, he says. Many detractors
have turned into admirers. He has won a Golden Nugget award from the
real estate industry for excellence in affordable housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Jasper Williams, director of commercial development at the city's
Community Development Department, says MacLeod is having a
"significantly good impact" on the area. "He's creating jobs and
places for local residents to buy food and other products where they
had no place to go before. It's been challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us just look and see a new building or a market. We don't
know what it takes to get it there. It takes a guy with real vision.
You've got to have vision and you've got to have hope. You can't be a
cynic, or you won't see the upside of things and you won't persist. I
have a lot of respect for Rob. He had a difficult vision to
implement, and he's getting it done."</TE>
<TE>   MacLeod Hopes to Cast a Wider Net</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's been a monumental effort, MacLeod concedes. But he has
much more in mind, if the fates and the city mothers and fathers are
with him. He wants to improve Lafayette Park, which sits across from
his building, surrounded by chain-link fence and often inhabited by
nogoodniks. He wants the park to teem with kids playing sports,
studying music and dance, using new facilities he hopes to help get
built there. He wants it to be a place for community meetings and
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Then he wants to move a bit farther east, and do the same for
McArthur Park--until the whole lower Wilshire area is restored to
vibrancy and health, much the way it was when his Townhouse was
young.</TE>

<LD>Most people turn to Paris or New York for cutting-edge fashions, but
couture designers do have a few blind spots. For example, they rarely
use snipers to test new wardrobes for invisibility. And they ignore
such design essentials as "butt patches," "omnidirectional flow" and
"improved wet-to-dry capability."</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the military is picking up the slack. Although the
house of Dior was on the right track last year with its--no
joke--$6,740 camouflage ball gown, it wasn't practical for combat
use. So the Marine Corps, in conjunction with an Army lab that
reportedly pioneered the technology behind M&amp;Ms and Spam, set out to
update the Corps' 22-year-old combat uniform.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Camp Pendleton unveiled the results to an enthusiastic
throng of sergeants, some of whom lined up at 4 a.m. to be the first
to buy the new duds.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like the Tickle Me Elmo doll," said Sgt. Major Royce Coffee,
surveying a line of shoppers that snaked around Camp Pendleton's
Military Clothing Store.</TE>
<TE>   Advance buzz on the new uniform was so great that four Marines
drove in from a base in El Paso, Texas, just for the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking feature of the uniform is its "digital"
camouflage pattern. In contrast with the current motif of brown,
black and green splotches, the new scheme is a computer-generated
montage of tiny green, black and khaki squares.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as the military equivalent of a George Seurat
pointillist painting.</TE>
<TE>   Up close, it's a collection of dots, but from a distance, it's
supposed to blend in with surrounding environments.</TE>
<TE>   The version that went on sale at Pendleton last week (and earlier
at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina) is for woodland combat.</TE>
<TE>   A desert model is coming soon. And an "urban camouflage" variation
is on the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to hypnotize the enemy with this pattern," joked one
sergeant standing in line to buy the new uniform. "It'll just confuse
the heck out of them."</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps has applied for three patents on the uniform,
which also features miniature eagle-globe-and-anchor emblems
imprinted on the fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The uniform even has its own Web site
(www.tecom.usmc.mil/mcub/utility), which states by way of
introduction: "As the Marine Corps moves forward into the 21st
century, we continue to look for new ways to improve the lethality,
survivability, durability and comfort of our Marines."</TE>
<TE>   Thus was the new spring line inspired. The design team included a
former West Point professor who tinkered with camouflage in the
1970s, military snipers who rated the patterns for invisibility, and
researchers at the Army's Natick, Mass., laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Rank-and-file Marines also got to weigh in via online surveys and
field testing of prototypes early last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody used their heads when they designed this," said Lt. Col.
Jeffrey S. Krongaard, who received an advance set of the duds several
weeks ago and demonstrated some of the innovations to the media at
Camp Pendleton. Among the highlights: ergonomic breast pockets
(slanted for easier access), recessed buttons on the sleeve cuffs (so
they won't snag), elasticized waistbands and pleated trousers.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes include removable elbow and knee pads, and a thicker
seat or "butt patch" for less wear and tear.</TE>
<TE>   But the most immediate benefit lies in the fabric. Although still
a 50-50 cotton-nylon blend, the new version is wash-and-wear, which
means Marines no longer need to starch and iron their clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The military brass want Marines to have more time for their
families and other duties, said Capt. Burrell Parmer, who is
following the new uniform around as sort of its unofficial spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Pendleton Marines were already calculating the money
they would save. So were several Oceanside dry-cleaning businesses
that cater almost exclusively to Marines having their uniforms
pressed and starched. The permanent-press uniforms "could affect us
big time," said  the owner of Dorothy's Military Shop and Laundry.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, the current uniforms also weren't supposed to need
dry-cleaning, said Donna Tompkins, who manages ABC Laundry and
Surplus. "I've had guys in here today [with the new uniforms] saying
they're going to dry-clean them anyway," she said. But she noted that
base officials are adamantly opposing dry-cleaning and conceded that
she might have to lay off some employees.</TE>
<TE>   If so, it won't happen immediately. The Marine Corps is phasing in
the new uniforms over four years. Soldiers are expected to purchase
one $67 set of jacket, hat and pants per year, until they own two
sets each of the woodland and desert camouflage outfits. Also being
phased in are rough-leather brown boots (no more spit-and-shine) at
$68 a pair. For enlisted men and women, the cost will be reimbursed
through a uniform allowance, but officers are on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Sergeants are getting first crack at the uniforms as a reward for
their service, Parmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Krongaard, for one, is happy to have company.</TE>
<TE>   "Until today, I've been one of the only people on the base that
had one," he said. "People kept coming up to me, wanting to touch it.
I'm tired of being a spectacle."</TE>
<TE>   Even civilians might soon join the act. Krongaard says his son has
already spotted a knockoff of the camouflage at Wal-Mart.</TE>

<LD>"Roadblock," a man in a black roll-neck sweater cried out from the
thick of the crowd trying to get into Track 16 Saturday evening.</LD>
<LD>   The reception at the Bergamot Station gallery, celebrating the
opening of "Signlanguage" with works by actor-painter-photographer
Viggo Mortensen, had attracted a big and varied crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Teenage boys clutching "Lord of the Rings" movie posters wandered
through the gallery, looking for the artist along with women in fake
fur and big jewelry who, in turn, clutched plastic cups with red
wine. (The gallery ramped up security after receiving a deluge of
calls from women who wanted to see the handsome star up close.)</LD>
<TE>   But at 7:15 p.m., more than an hour into the opening, Mortensen,
a.k.a. Lord Aragorn "Strider" Elessar of "Fellowship of the Ring,"
was nowhere to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Rath's installation "Oakland, Portable," a sound system
embedded in a couple of fiberglass suitcases, blared as a couple of
women stood in front of Mortensen's glossy photos and paintings,
looking furtively for the star. 7:30 p.m. Still no Mortensen, but
Dominic Monaghan, a.k.a. Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck, posed for
photos with guests as fellow "Ring" star Elijah Wood appeased them.
"He's fashionably late," Wood told a woman who'd cornered him.
"Fashionably late?" the woman shot back. "The show ends in 15
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 8 p.m., Mortensen arrived through the back door,
wearing a green suit, his trademark jade pendant, brown leather shoes
(stained with yellow paint) and a brown Burger King name tag that
read: "Viggo."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the crowd of women around him was impenetrable.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't look like Strider, but it's him," a woman said to her
two daughters, who watched from the periphery of the group. "This is
so exciting for you guys."</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that up there?" a blond woman in the back asked, loudly.
"Oh, that's the artist? He's cute," she said, before elbowing her way
toward Mortensen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't object to people coming here because of the movie if they
see the art," Mortensen said. But, he joked, "maybe some people will
think I need painting lessons."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Last Goodbye</TE>
<TE>   There were roses on every flat surface. Swinging tunes from a
five-piece jazz band filled the place. White-coated waiters passed
hors d'oeuvres to guests who wore diamonds and furs. This was Peggy
Lee's last party.</TE>
<TE>   On a 70-degree Saturday morning at the Riviera Country Club in
Pacific Palisades, about 300 of the jazz singer's fans, family and
oldest friends gathered to say goodbye at a special memorial service.
Lee, known for hits such as "Fever" and "Is That All There Is?", died
of a heart attack on Jan. 21 at her home in Bel-Air, three years
after a debilitating stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Phoebe Jacobs and jazz singer Cy Coleman  flew in from New York,
and their memories of Lee reveal a woman who favored tight satin
gowns, feather boas and 3-inch heels, a mercurial woman who was
charming with a wicked sense of humor. When Quincy Jones once
complained of exhaustion, she told him: "Quincy, even a mink has to
lay down sometime."</TE>
<TE>   "When she was good, she was very good, but when she was bad .... "
Jacobs told the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs met Lee in 1954 while working as a secretary at Lee's
label, Decca Records, in New York. "She was the star, and I was the
office girl," said Jacobs, 83. The two women became close friends
years later after Jacobs' uncle opened a Manhattan jazz club, a place
on 48th and Lexington called Basin Street East, named after a Louie
Armstrong song.</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke of her old friend, Jacobs pulled from her handbag a
pair of sunglasses that once belonged to Lee. They were round, tinted
frames surrounded by rhinestones. Jacob handled them delicately as
she told the story. "I had an allergy," she said, that caused her
eyes to swell. When Lee saw her friend's puffy eyes, she handed over
the Elton John-style glasses.</TE>
<TE>   She put the glasses away and announced that it was time to sample
the food. Jacobs led a new acquaintance by the hand to a table of
chocolate-covered strawberries, tangerine tarts, mini pecan pies and
marshmallow-filled cookies and stopped. "This," she said, "is where
Peggy Lee would have started."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Political Star Power</TE>
<TE>   Robert Reich, the former U.S. Labor Secretary who is running for
governor of Massachusetts, will join Arianna Huffington and Tom
Hayden onstage Feb. 17 at USC's Boward Auditorium to weigh in on "Our
Democracy after 9-11; Can We Save It?" The conference, presented by
Southern California Americans for Democratic Action, will also
include presentations by Jim Hightower and Antonio Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   Barbra Streisand, Annette Bening, Warren Beatty and Rob Reiner are
expected to attend a private cocktail party after the conference.</TE>

<LD>ON GREEN DOLPHIN STREET</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Sebastian Faulks</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   356 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Charlie van der Linden is a witty, extroverted Brit diplomat
recently transferred to Washington, D.C. He's fond of Ornette
Coleman, Emily Dickinson, casual flings and dry martinis, not
necessarily in that order. The year is 1960, party presidential
nominations are gathering a full head of steam, and Charlie's
less-than-taxing job is to interpret for superiors the shenanigans of
the Yanks. Flanked by his adoring wife, Mary, and their two treasured
children, Charlie has a life that is charmed beyond deserving, a
journey from function to catered function on a river of whiskey and
gin.</TE>
<TE>   One of Charlie's riffs is to insist that his wife is working on a
novel. To the reader, aware that Mary carries hardly a thought in her
head beyond love for her family and a sense of life's grace, this
seems unlikely. But halfway into "On Green Dolphin Street," for
reasons of her own, Mary suddenly announces her intent to write a
book. A guest asks, "'Do you like the idea of your wife being an
author?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Sure,' said Charlie. 'The new Emily Dickinson. Or Edith Wharton,
perhaps.' He filled his glass. 'Or Grace Metalious. A 'Peyton Place'
would do fine. Then I could retire from the service. Then I could
retire from the service.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Does she know enough about suburban adultery?"</TE>
<TE>   Mary slips in the answer. "'I'm sure I could find out, Eddie.'"</TE>
<TE>   One doesn't associate Sebastian Faulks, author of the bestsellers
"Birdsong" and "Charlotte Gray," with postmodern self-consciousness.
But the edginess of the remarks above, in a novel that is precisely
and agonizingly about midlife adultery, shows he's capable of winking
at the reader.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Faulks steps in front of the curtain again, this time
hinting at an aspect of his purpose through Charlie's thoughts: ' ...
the urge that was common to them all [novelists] was a need to
improve on the thin texture of life ... to give to existence a
pattern, a richness and a value that in actuality it lacked. If after
reading such a novel you looked again at life--its unplotted
emergencies, narrative non sequiturs and pitiful lack of significance
... it might seem to glow with a little of that borrowed luster; it
might seem after all to be charged with some transcendent value." Is
Faulks inviting us to put "On Green Dolphin Street" to this test?</TE>
<TE>   Though Mary's project may need more research into the world of
adultery, that choice so often perceived by lovers as no choice at
all, Faulks' clearly does not. He knows the territory the way a hawk
knows its meadow.</TE>
<TE>   Every twitch is registered; he becomes the lovers. He knows not
only the dizzying blissful abyss of the first fall--the
insubstantiality of doubt and remorse, the sense of having
transgressed one's nature that is terrible and liberating. He also
knows how swiftly and soundlessly a love that appeared rock-solid can
vanish, leaving only a husk behind. When the novel opens, Mary sees
Charlie as "the fountain of her happiness," a man who "drank only a
little more than most men they knew." Only a few weeks later she can
characterize her husband's hobbies as "drinking liquor, taking
barbiturates and benzedrine tablets, smoking cigarettes and
misquoting poetry." Now there's an emotional distance traveled.</TE>
<TE>   Mary has met Frank Renzo, a crusading reporter battling his way
out of his editor's doghouse, where he was sent for standing up
against Joe McCarthy &amp; Co. once too often. Like friend and rival
Charlie, he's something of a war hero, but otherwise a self-reliant
bootstrapper who started from Chicago's mean streets, lives and
breathes New York City, despises Ornette Coleman and reveres Miles
Davis. The first time Mary visits his apartment, on the phonograph is
Miles playing "Stella by Starlight." (If you read this book, remember
that.) It's an absorbing, tender scene, as is each of their
encounters. In Mary's later, pleading words: "It's a miracle, Frank.
That we've come from so far apart, different worlds ... only I could
give you the happiness you deserve."</TE>
<TE>   "On Green Dolphin Street" inhabits two worlds in another sense.
There is the world of Charlie's suffering and Frank and Mary's
passion, as timeless as the tale of Tristan and Isolde. Then there is
the historical world of D.C., 1960, reaching back, for example, into
a masterful set scene at Dien Bien Phu and then forward to
intimations of the compromised Camelot to come. Englishman Faulks'
fascination with the period is palpable, and his research into
contemporary culture and politics nearly impeccable. But the emphasis
on superannuated details--prissy women's clothing, cigarette
brands--has a distancing effect, as if one were "watching" a faithful
re-creation, rather than (as in Cheever or Updike, say) the actual
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Romance? Docudrama? Maybe some third creation: There's a wrenching
turn toward novel's end, as if the hawk's tilting wing has shaded the
whole meadow dark. A brief misunderstanding cracks open to a canyon
of impermanence and loss. Destiny, passion, honor--are these things
entirely insubstantial, mere "narrative non sequiturs"? Does
Charlie's inconsolable, bloodshot eye perceive the truth?</TE>

<HD>Are We Giving Teens a Bad Rap?</HD>
<DH>Experts say stereotypes get in the way of viewing
adolescence as a normal growth process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA SESSIONS STEPP</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scan any bookstore shelf for new titles about teenagers and you'd
think the younger generation is no longer going to hell in a
handbasket -- it's already there.</LD>
<LD>   Here are three dire-sounding new titles: "Parenting Your
Out-of-Control Teenager"; "How to Keep Your Teenager Out of Trouble
and What to Do if You Can't"; and, stating what parents have long
suspected, "Yes, Your Teen Is Crazy!"</LD>
<LD>   Except that your teen is not, according to a small but growing
chorus of professionals who are trying to focus the public on the
fact that teenagers are developing, not deficient, creatures. They
say false impressions are negatively affecting how parents parent and
teachers teach, how lawmakers and taxpayers allocate money for
youths, and how young people think about themselves.</LD>
<TE>   "People are absolutely convinced that teens are dangerous and in
danger, silly and self-absorbed, lazy and corrupted by consumerism,"
said Susan Nall Bales, a communications analyst who runs the
FrameWorks Institute, a Washington research firm.</TE>
<TE>   In nationwide surveys for FrameWorks, only about one in six adults
said youths today share their ethical values, such as honesty and
hard work. In reality, when youths are polled, large majorities rate
those same traits highly.</TE>
<TE>   Adults in one survey were asked what words most applied to today's
young people, compared with young people 20 years ago. They chose
"selfish" and "materialistic" for today's youth, "patriotic" and
"idealistic" for youth in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to tell ourselves a new story about youth," Bales
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   James Youniss agreed. The developmental psychologist has examined
national behavior data on teenagers from the 1950s on and said: "I
was surprised. The present generation of youth is remarkably
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Violence by kids has dropped significantly, according to the
national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, an instrument of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of teenage pregnancy is
declining, as is the proportion of teenagers who have had sex.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette smoking, drinking and the use of most illegal drugs are
down. The suicide rate, although higher than in other Western
countries, has held steady for several years.</TE>
<TE>   More students are graduating from high school now than 10 years
ago. School test scores are the same as 30 years ago, with minority
students scoring slightly better than minorities in the past.
Religious participation is stable, and the number of young people
performing community service has risen slightly.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to deny the difficulties that teenagers face,"
Youniss said, "but you can't sustain the argument that there's
something really odd about these kids."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the stereotypes endure, for several reasons, the image
changers say. Age segregation is one. Psychologist Peter Scales,
senior fellow for the Search Institute, a Minneapolis think tank on
youth issues, notes that fewer U.S. households have children or
adolescents now than 40 years ago. Teenagers don't have the contact
with older adults they once had, and humans tend to fear that with
which they're not familiar.</TE>
<TE>   Such fear and misunderstanding are exaggerated by the way
teenagers are represented in the media, analyst Bales says. In
newspapers, young people most often appear in crime stories, as
either victims or perpetrators. Television portrays teenagers
absorbed in problems with friends or creating problems for their
families.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists who study youths and agencies that serve them
frequently must demonstrate major deficits in teenagers to acquire
resources from government agencies and private foundations. If such
specialists aren't careful, they can easily conclude that many young
people are troubled, and pass on those conclusions to an uninformed
public.</TE>
<TE>   In "Yes, Your Teen Is Crazy!" (Harbor Press), Philadelphia
psychologist Michael Bradley makes such claims more than the authors
of the two other new books. To make his case that teenagers are
temporarily insane, Bradley draws on the work of Jay Giedd, a
psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   Giedd and other researchers used magnetic resonance technology to
show that the part of the adolescent brain that regulates emotions,
impulses and decision-making grows rapidly until age 20. Bradley
claims this means that until they reach adulthood, teenagers are
"brain challenged."</TE>
<TE>   "This wild brain development may create new, unpredictable thought
pathways," he writes, "wherein action thoughts can outrace judgment
capabilities just as they did in early childhood. ... Both toddler
and adolescent brains at times are unstable, dysfunctional and
completely unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   But Giedd said it's wrong to compare the teenage mind to the
adult's.</TE>
<TE>   "Neurologically challenged is not how I would frame this," he said
in an interview. "Teens are impulsive, but just as children grow
taller, so teens' frontal lobes get better at sorting out
consequences. It's like height in children. Children grow taller, but
we don't call them bad for being short." Bradley's writing, he adds,
"makes teens sound incapable of making sound decisions. Parents
should guide them, but they are increasingly capable."</TE>
<TE>   As indicated in his book's title, "How to Keep Your Teenager Out
of Trouble and What to Do If You Can't" (Workman), Washington
psychologist Neil Bernstein focuses most of his attention on problems
that can make parents feel they're nearing the end of their rope: "I
have dealt with family issues ranging from daily annoyances [sarcasm,
dirty rooms, procrastinating over homework] to significant crises
[antisocial behavior, substance abuse, flagrant defiance]. ...
Regrettably my business is booming."</TE>
<TE>   The book with the scariest title, "Parenting Your Out-of-Control
Teenager" (St. Martin's) is the least frightening: Social worker
Scott Sells makes it clear he's describing only those young people
who repeatedly demonstrate extreme behaviors.</TE>
<TE>   These authors defend their problem-oriented approach by saying
they must hook potential readers where the readers are, in a state of
confusion and concern. Then they can introduce the parenting
techniques that encourage, as well as limit, teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to hear anything positive about your kid when he has
just given you the bird," Sells said.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley is blunt: "I don't think anyone would pick up a book
building on the good."</TE>
<TE>   Work by the Search Institute suggests otherwise. Six years ago,
the institute began helping communities identify and increase the
opportunities for local youths to learn and serve. To date, 560
communities, 24 states and two Canadian provinces have signed on to
the Search effort.</TE>
<TE>   Starting from old assumptions may not get people to believe
anything but the old assumptions, argues Ross Thompson, psychology
professor at the University of Nebraska: "As we shift through all the
evidence relating to a particular subject, we tend to remember that
which confirms our earlier impressions, and discount or forget that
which is different."</TE>
<TE>   Expecting the worst from teenagers has serious consequences, Bales
and others say. It may help explain why lawmakers have spent millions
to send juveniles to adult prison, and why schools now suspend
students for silly infractions. It also may clarify why voters deny
funds for better schools and after-school care: If a task is seen as
too difficult, people simply won't attempt it.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario also frightens parents and distances them
from their children, Sells said. Mom and Dad either absolve
themselves of responsibility or become over-controlling, obsessed
with keeping their offspring safe.</TE>
<TE>   Adult pessimism also likely affects how teenagers feel about
themselves. "In the midst of all the other threats to their
self-esteem, society's mistrust can't help but partly account for the
moodiness of this period of life. We expect bad behavior, and that
may be why we get so many sad youth," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Early, critical voices haunt teenagers  into adulthood, whispering
things like, "You ruin everything" or "The nurses must have dropped
you on your head," says Cheri Huber, whose new book, "There Is
Nothing Wrong With You, for Teens" (Keep It Simple Books), shows
teenagers how to disregard destructive words from others.</TE>
<TE>   Social scientists, journalists and others must do a better job of
putting their horrifying revelations in the context of normal
adolescent growth, according to Bales.</TE>
<TE>   "We must start looking at adolescents not as impaired adults,"
Bales said, "but as inexperienced young people experimenting with
their identity in order to become adults."</TE>

<HD>Teaching the Younger Generation Respect and the Value of a
Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNAE O'NEAL PARKER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I can't say just when I began having the children of my closest
friends go from calling me "Lonnae" to calling me "Aunt Lonnae" or
"Miss Lonnae." And my insistence on "Mrs. Parker" for the kids of
people I don't know well seemed to creep up on me from nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   I had my older daughter when I was 26 and felt a lot like Lonnae
and very little like Mrs. Parker. That name was reserved for my
mother-in-law, my sister-in-law--grown people for whom a title was
appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   Those were casual times, and we young mothers were Lonnae and
Stephanie and Terina and Shonda--certainly a switch from how things
were when I was a kid. Growing up on Chicago's South Side, I didn't
think adults even came with first names. They were always, without
exception, Mrs. Tate, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Farrow, or Aunt and Uncle
so-and-so. There was simply a certain ingrained way you talked to
grown people.</LD>
<TE>   "All adults were like teachers to me," recalls BET online producer
Stephanie Crockett, now "Aunt Stephanie" to my two daughters. (I'm
now Aunt Lonnae to her 8-year-old daughter.)</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember calling folks by their first names when I was
coming up, even with a Ms. in front of them," she says. "It was Mrs.
and Mr. and their last names only."</TE>
<TE>   As a young mother, "I felt like I wasn't a grown-up," Crockett
says, and only real adults should be addressed with titles. "Now I
feel like it is just a matter of respect."</TE>
<TE>   Certain cultural and geographic traditions are repeated, says
Karen Grigsby Bates, co-author of "Basic Black: Home Training for
Modern Times" (Doubleday, 1996), an etiquette book targeted to
African Americans. For many black Southerners, self-definition became
an important counter to a history of disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "To have somebody 16 call you 'Sally' was very insulting when
you've lived five times as long as they have," Bates says. "When we
got the chance to say how we were going to be addressed or how we
addressed ourselves, we were very careful to extend to each other the
courtesies that others were not willing to give us."</TE>
<TE>   My first memory of deliberately using "Mrs. Parker" came nearly
three years ago, while on assignment with Washington Post
photographer Susan Biddle. We were introducing ourselves to the
6-year-old daughter of a man I was writing about.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, I'm Susan," said Biddle.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, I'm Mrs. Parker," I said.</TE>
<TE>   Biddle, who is older than I am, calls herself an Army brat who
grew up with strict rules and "standard operating procedures." She
was taught always to use Mr. or Mrs. unless she got specific
permission not to, she says--a habit she still uses when talking with
older adults.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she doesn't feel it's inappropriate or disrespectful to
invite a child to call her Susan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not married," Biddle says. "If I were married, I'd maybe say,
'I'm Mrs. Biddle.'" Besides, "I like kids a lot, and I want them to
relate to me. I think it's easier for them to relate to you if you
use first names. You don't have that teacher image."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the last 25 years have produced a marked decrease in
the culture of formality surrounding adult-child relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gotten busy, and these old rules of manners have fallen
by the wayside," says Sheryl Eberly, author of "365 Manners Kids
Should Know" (Three Rivers Press, 2001). "Kids have become very
peer-oriented, and there are times when kids don't even respond when
adults talk to them."</TE>
<TE>   Eberly says recent generations have "spent a lot of time doing
everything we can to develop our children's self-esteem and encourage
them to be honest about their feelings, and what we have gotten is
children who think they are the center of the world. I think it is
time to have the pendulum swing the other way a little bit and have
our children become more aware of others. We aren't peers."</TE>
<TE>   P.M. Forni, author of "Choosing Civility: The 25 Rules of
Considerate Conduct" (St. Martin's Press), publishing this month,
theorizes that distrust of formality is a deeply ingrained part of
the American character, dating to the colonies' break with England.
This distrust was combined with the status change of children a
couple of generations ago, when they went from an inferior class (to
be seen and not heard) to one of special regard.</TE>
<TE>   Add the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and "it is
no surprise that empowered children would eventually address adults
as their equals," Forni says.</TE>

<LD>Functional Reading</LD>
<LD>   Do you know that there are many different kinds of reading? When
you read the directions on the back of the box of Jell-O or look at
the comics in the newspaper or glance at the cover of a magazine,
you're reading something. You knew that. But you also have to know
how to read things that have no words: the sky (Is it going to
rain?), a person's face (Is she mad at me?) or a red light (Stop!).
This kind of reading is called "functional reading," and it's a very
important skill.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, functional reading is so important that you are tested on
it in school. Sometimes this testing is in the form of a story
problem in arithmetic, like this:</LD>
<TE>   If Jill has a sandwich and decides to divide it in half and then
in half again, how many pieces will she have?</TE>
<TE>   Now put that answer in the form of a fraction.</TE>
<TE>   If Jill gives one piece to Sally and one to Leon, what fraction of
a sandwich will she have left to eat for herself?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Answers: 4; 4/4; 2/4 or 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Functional reading is necessary to our everyday lives, but it is
also fun. For more practice, tune in to the KLCS-produced "Homework
Hotline," from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Wednesday on KLCS-TV. You can also
call 800-LA STUDY to get answers to questions about your homework
assignments over the telephone.</TE>

<LD>She was smart enough to graduate at the top of her class at tiny
Owen-Withee High School in Wisconsin. Yet, friends of Karen Marie
Hubbard say the 19-year-old college freshman may not have realized
she was pregnant until she delivered a baby last week in a bathroom
stall at her college dorm.</LD>
<LD>   By the time campus officials found her, her newborn baby was
struggling to live and Karen had bled to death on the bathroom floor.</LD>
<LD>   Now her friends and family are trying to understand how a girl so
competent and kind could miss the signs of her pregnancy, or keep it
a secret, if she knew. And her classmates at the University of
Wisconsin-Eau Claire are pondering a lesson in the power of the mind
that is more profound than any their professors could teach.</LD>
<TE>   "If she didn't want to believe it, you can explain anything,"
student body vice president Kelly Witkowski told local reporters.
"We're always told that when you go to college, you gain weight.
You're stressed about being in a new place. Your body goes through a
lot of changes. You can rationalize away a lot of things."</TE>
<TE>   As a woman who's given birth three times, I find it hard to
understand how the signs of pregnancy could be ignored for nine
months by even the most innocent of teenage girls. But doctors and
social workers who deal with young mothers say it happens all the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it seems hard to believe, but the mind is a very powerful
thing," says Caroline Burry, professor of social work at the
University of Maryland in Baltimore. "It's very protective. ... It's
not unusual for a young woman to go from 'This can't be happening to
me' to 'This isn't happening to me.' They totally disassociate from
what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   There's been little research on the phenomenon, Burry says, but as
a social worker dealing with adoption, she sees many young women who
did not realize they were pregnant until they landed in the delivery
room. "Some have had very limited sexual experience, so they didn't
really know what was going on. Others just couldn't bear to consider
the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard fits the profile of the young woman most apt to deny or
hide a pregnancy. "She seems like the classic picture," Burry says.
"High achiever, close to her family, the good girl who keeps playing
sports, doing well in school. She thinks, 'I'm not the kind of girl
who does this.' They may think, 'I'll lose my scholarship, my life
will be ruined.' They can't bear to disappoint their parents,
teachers, friends."</TE>
<TE>   Young people tend to engage in a naive sort of denial on many
levels and in many circumstances, she points out. "It's a protective
response, as in 'I couldn't possibly be flunking out, therefore I'm
not.' It allows them to avoid having to consider things they fear
would be devastating."</TE>
<TE>   And denial doesn't operate only in this arena or among the young,
of course. We often engage in a sort of denial, as a means of
avoiding difficult problems, a way of holding uncomfortable emotions
at bay. "We all know someone who's engaging in denial on some level,"
Burry says. "Like the woman whose husband is having an affair and all
the signs are there, and she has to know it, but she swears nothing's
wrong. Upon reflection, we can all think of cases like that, or times
we've done that."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of pregnant teens caught by surprise by childbirth,
"it's more than not facing up to it," she says. "The truth becomes
'transparent' as they look for pieces of information that support
their denial.... It's an ego defense that protects the self from
painful knowledge. If you can keep yourself from believing it, it
lessens the pain and distress."</TE>
<TE>   Therapists say denial can be a useful tool, giving us time to
prepare by cushioning the shock of the unbelievable. Who among us
didn't experience a moment, at least, of denial as we watched the
planes crash into the World Trade Center?: This can't be happening.
It is too tragic, too extreme to even comprehend.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, reality ends our dance with denial, just as the
pains of labor signal an end to a pregnant teen's fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   Other times, we persist in holding on to airbrushed versions of
our world, because to do otherwise would make us too uncomfortable. I
see that in the e-mails I receive when I write about emotional
issues, like race. Why do you keep writing about problems involving
race? readers complain. As if our silence could make them go away.</TE>
<TE>   That desperate wish may be what led Karen Hubbard into that
bathroom stall alone, unprepared for reality so frightening she kept
trying to will it away. But while denial may preserve our sense of
innocence, it does nothing to keep us safe.</TE>
<TE>   There will always be problems, but there are also solutions ...
difficult and painful, maybe, but necessary. Because denial is not
deliverance. Its innocence has a price to pay, too.</TE>

<HD>Meet Venus, Serena Williams</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: Venus and Serena Williams are
training to compete with the best tennis players in the world.</DH>

<LD>By the time she was 10, Venus was already 5 feet 4 and winning match
after match. She was becoming a Southern California legend. So was
Serena. Both could jump higher, hit harder and cover the court better
than most opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Getting and staying in shape takes a lot of hard work. Women's
tennis matches can last two hours or more so being in top form is
important. According to Tennis magazine, Venus usually jumps rope for
five minutes to warm up, then does arm, shoulder and triceps
exercises. Sometimes she goes to an aerobics class to improve her
footwork. Much of her workout consists of drills her father picked up
from other sports. She throws a football or baseball the length of a
court for 30 minutes to improve her serve, or she plays soccer on the
court with Serena to help with footwork. She works out with boxing
gloves and a speed bag. She surfs to improve her balance. For
stamina, she may run a mile and do wind sprints.</LD>
<LD>   While in school, the girls had to keep up their grades as well as
practice and compete. Their father taught them that an education was
even more important than tennis. When she was 15, Venus told
Seventeen magazine, "Whatever I put in my head will stay there and
that's not necessarily true of tennis."</LD>

their goal.</TE>

<HD>Karzai's Toughest Job Is in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>History shows that the keys to his country's future aren't
abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P. EDWARD HALEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of the war in Afghanistan is in sight, so let us look beyond:
Where is history likely to position Hamid Karzai?</LD>
<LD>   Will he stand with Konrad Adenauer of Germany, Syngman Rhee of
South Korea and the other U.S. aid success stories?</LD>
<LD>   Or will he be among U.S.-supported leaders who failed, including
Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam and the shah of Iran?</LD>
<TE>   As in Afghanistan today, the stakes in all those cases were the
survival of governments, the welfare of people and the vital
interests of the United States. The relationships between the United
States and Germany, South Korea, South Vietnam and Iran offer insight
into what makes for success and failure within a country as it
struggles to recover from destructive war and internal disunity.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, Korea and South Vietnam, the United States went to war
to achieve its ends. Successful in Germany and South Korea, American
military intervention failed in Vietnam and was not attempted when
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the shah of Iran. The
United States gave generous economic assistance to all four
countries.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, American military action has succeeded in
overthrowing the Taliban and capturing or killing many members of the
Al Qaeda terrorist organization. Economic assistance to Afghanistan
has been pledged by the United States and its wealthy allies in
Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   A striking feature of the German and Korean experience is the
extent to which their economic success came from domestic rather than
external causes. The United States provided external security and
large-scale economic aid, but the German and Korean "economic
miracles" were largely the result of the hard work of ordinary
citizens who sacrificed themselves to make a better future for their
children and grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Neither South Vietnam nor Iran was able to make its economy or
political system succeed. South Vietnam's task was the more
difficult. The government and people had to cope with a debilitating
civil war and a decade of combat between an American expeditionary
force and North Vietnamese military units as well as guerrillas. In
the end, the South Vietnamese government gave the U.S. everything it
wanted except an honest, effective government, which was the key to
everything else.</TE>
<TE>   And bent on forcing modernization on his society regardless of
cost, the shah of Iran isolated himself and alienated his people.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, the centralization needed for economic recovery
and political effectiveness can come only at the expense of the
warlords who destroyed post-Soviet Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting has already broken out between some of them. It was
Afghans, not Afghanistan, who defeated foreigners in the past. And it
is Afghans who threaten Afghanistan today.</TE>
<TE>   Here lies the first and one of the most important tests of
Karzai's abilities. Can the interim prime minister discover ways of
satisfying these competing warlords without surrendering all chance
for unity and development?</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the second major problem, religion. Some South
Asians say that "the Arabs," or Islamic extremists, have hijacked
Islam, and that moderates who are believers have failed to answer the
radical mullahs. Inevitably, Karzai's political and economic plans
for recovery will collide with Islamic law and custom. On this score,
there is little that the industrialized nations can do to help.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the political, economic and religious keys to
Afghanistan's future are at home, not abroad. Karzai must find the
means to inspire his people to reconcile their differences and
postpone their present hopes for comfort and prosperity on behalf of
future generations, while working harder than they ever have.</TE>
<TE>   It may be easier for Karzai to deal with foreigners than with his
own fractious, divided and long-suffering people. That was true of
the shah and the South Vietnamese government. Karzai's challenge is
to centralize authority while preserving unity and the opportunity
for progress. Now that he has completed a round of travel to the
U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan, Karzai should stay home and
begin the hard work.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Budget Has Flaws, but Works</HD>
<DH>The governor's plan passes the test of pragmatism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEON E. PANETTA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I served as chairman of the House Budget Committee and was
struggling to put together a tough fiscal package to reduce federal
deficits, a senior member of Congress pulled me aside. A tough
budget, he counseled, was no good if it didn't pass.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, that is the dilemma that faces every president,
governor or budget chairman, including Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge is to fashion a budget that recognizes political
realities that must be balanced and yet provides the flexibility for
negotiation. In the pragmatic test of moving the governing process
toward a final and successful budget, Davis' proposal is a good
start.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the budget can be criticized from all sides for all
kinds of reasons: too political, should have raised taxes to close
the budget gap, not enough cutting, too dependent on fund shifts and
transfers.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody in the Legislature has labeled it "dead on arrival"
because, deep down, they know there are few alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   In an election year in a state in recession, there is little
likelihood that the Legislature will have the political will or
courage to enact tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, with more Californians needing the support of
safety net programs, these should be protected. And if there is to be
a midyear recovery, as some project, it is important not to retreat
from the gains made in education, public safety, the environment and
health care coverage.</TE>
<TE>   So where does California turn to deal with a $12.5-billion budget
deficit? It turns, as it must, to a combination of proposals included
in the governor's recommended budget: $5.2 billion in reductions;
$586 million in funding shifts; $1billion in federal funding
increases in security, health care, child support and immigration;
and $5.6 billion in loans, payment deferrals and transfers.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is pretty and yet it provides the principal
ingredients of a budget that will pass.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that if economic recovery is delayed and there is
little rebound in state resources, that as Davis' budget says,
"additional measures will be necessary." That's budget language that
really means: If anyone has any other bright ideas to deal with this
mess, let's hear them.</TE>
<TE>   The steps needed to solve deficits are by their nature contrary to
every political instinct. Most members of the Legislature believe
that they are elected to spend money, cut taxes and bring home the
bacon, not to reduce deficits.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the federal government
was running close to $300-billion annual deficits, there wasn't a
member of Congress who didn't have a simple solution to balancing the
budget. Change the Constitution to require a balanced budget. Raise
taxes across the board. Cut defense spending. End welfare, reduce
domestic spending and cut entitlement programs. Give the president
line-item veto power. Few of these were politically acceptable. The
result was to borrow and spend. The national debt quadrupled.</TE>
<TE>   In California, which requires a balanced budget to be passed by a
two-thirds majority of the Legislature, governing can happen only by
negotiation, compromise and consensus.</TE>
<TE>   That is the essence of our democracy. It is also the essence of
the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   Is the governor's approach to reducing the deficit the only way to
get the job done? Probably not. But has he presented a pragmatic
framework within which the political process has a realistic
opportunity of finding the necessary consensus to bridge the budget
gap? I believe he has.</TE>

<HD>An Orgy of Defense Spending</HD>
<DH>Bush's 'axis of evil' rhetoric fabricates a need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now we get to see just how cowardly the Democrats in Congress can be.
President Bush has proposed the most preposterous military buildup in
human history--annual spending of $451 billion by 2007--and nary a
word of criticism has been heard from the other side of the aisle.
The president is drunk with the popularity that his war on terrorism
has brought, and those sober Democrats and Republicans, who know
better, are afraid to wrestle him for the keys to the budget before
he drives off a cliff.</LD>
<LD>   The red ink that Bush wants us to bleed to line the pockets of the
defense industry, along with the tax cuts for the rich, will do more
damage to our country than any terrorist. The result will be an
economically hobbled United States, unable to solve its major
domestic problems or support meaningful foreign aid, its enormous
wealth sacrificed at the altar of military hardware that is largely
without purpose.</LD>
<LD>   Why the panic to throw billions more at the military when even the
Pentagon brass have told us it is not needed? Our military forces,
much maligned as inadequate by Bush during the election campaign,
proved to be lacking in nothing once the administration decided to
stop playing footsie with the Taliban and eliminate those monsters of
our own creation.</LD>
<TE>   It was obviously not a lack of hardware that made us vulnerable to
the cruelty of Sept. 11 but rather a failure of will by President
Clinton, and then Bush, to brand the Taliban as terrorists and then
to take out the well-marked camps of Al Qaeda with the
counterinsurgency machine we have been perfecting since the Kennedy
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton authorized the elimination of Osama bin Laden in 1998, but
the spy agencies simply failed to execute the order. Neither,
apparently, were they competent enough to track Al Qaeda agents from
training camps in Afghanistan to flight schools in Florida. All this
even though these agencies possess secret budgets of at least $70
billion a year, combined.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ability to read license plates from outer space and
scan the world's e-mail, our intelligence agencies lost the trail of
terrorists who easily found cover with lap dancers in strip joints.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that we need sharper agents, not more expensive
equipment. There is not an item in the Bush budget that will make us
more secure from the next terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   That being obvious, Bush is now resorting to the tried and true
"evil empire" rhetorical strategy, grouping the disparate regimes of
Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   This alleged axis then becomes the rationale for a
grossly expanded military budget, the idea being that the United States
must be prepared to fight a conventional war on three fronts.</TE>
<TE>   However, no such axis exists. North Korea is a tottering relic of
a state whose nuclear operation was about to be bought off under the
skilled leadership of the South Korean government when Bush
jettisoned the deal. Iraq and Iran have been implacable foes for 25
years, and both were despised by the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a key Muslim ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia,
produced 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers--and Bin Laden. Saudi Arabia
is also where Al Qaeda does its biggest fund-raising and yet,
inexplicably, it is excluded from the new enemies list.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the accepted goal were the overthrow of the three brutal
regimes targeted by President Bush, that would hardly requirean
expansion of a war machine built to humble the Soviet Union in its
prime.</TE>
<TE>   Is Bush the younger now telling us that his father failed to
topple Saddam Hussein because he lacked sufficient firepower? The
road to Baghdad was wide open after we obliterated the vaunted Iraqi
tank army in a matter of weeks. Or does Bush the younger have even
more grandiose plans in mind?</TE>
<TE>   His astonishing budget makes sense only if we are planning to use
our mighty military in a pseudo-religious quest to create a
super-dominant Pax Americana.</TE>
<TE>   Bizarre as that sounds, it may be the real framework for Bush's
proposed spending orgy. In any case, almost every non-American
speaker at the World Economic Forum in New York expressed fear at
this specter.</TE>
<TE>   Even our own Bill Gates was alarmed at the United States' apparent
hubris: "People who feel the world is tilted against them will spawn
the kind of hatred that is very dangerous for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Is it too much to ask that these billions, our billions, be spent
to enhance our security rather than further erode it?</TE>

<LD>Polls show Americans believe that about 15% of the federal budget
goes for foreign aid. The actual number is less than 1%, a dismal
figure that would remain about the same under President Bush's
$2.1-trillion budget for next year.</LD>
<LD>   There are numerous competing priorities for the taxpayer's money.
Last September's terror means that more money must be spent on
defense and homeland security. But spending more on foreign aid would
increase this country's security by helping nations lift themselves
out of the poverty that breeds despair and, in some cases, dangerous
antipathy toward economically successful nations.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Jesse Helms, who thankfully is retiring, some years ago
denounced sending too much money "down foreign rat holes." But the
eradication of smallpox wasn't a rat hole. The U.S. Agency for
International Development helped U.N. agencies and health workers in
other countries purchase and distribute smallpox vaccine. It
persuaded nurses in villages to educate women to inoculate their
children against smallpox and provided cards to show that the shots
had been given. Today the United States is also spending money on
simple but effective treatments to save infants in the Third World
from dying of diarrhea. Other funds pay for tablets that villagers
can drop in a well so they can drink the water without becoming sick.
Yes, strings must be attached to money, and vigilance is required to
ensure it pays for health or a schoolhouse and not another
Rolls-Royce for the local potentate. But it can be done. It must be
done.</TE>
<TE>   The United States once did spend 15% of its budget on foreign aid.
That was in the years after World War II, and the money, especially
Marshall Plan money, helped rebuild all of Western Europe, a great
achievement that strengthened democracies and averted wars.</TE>
<TE>   Today HIV and AIDS threaten to kill so much of the educated class
in Africa that many nations may be forced onto the road to collapse.
The Bush administration last year put $300 million into the Global
Fund to Fight  AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This year's figure is
$200 million, a step in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong argument to be made that if the United States
had not turned its back on Afghanistan after the Soviet Union
withdrew its troops there it could have helped stop the downward
spiral and constant battling of warlords that cleared the path for
the dreaded Taliban. More foreign aid could have built schools, grown
crops and improved health enough to steer the nation away from
decades of disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), chairman of the House committee that
handles foreign aid, has said that the United States can build a
school in Pakistan for $60,000 and operate it for $10,000. That would
give parents an alternative to those Islamic schools that teach only
the Koran and hatred of America. In the Senate, California Democrat
Dianne Feinstein and several colleagues have been pushing to triple
foreign aid. They need to increase the volume of their arguments to
the Bush administration and the American people.</TE>

<HD>What? Good Ideas in D.C.?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So didja hear the one about the financial scam being run right out of
the Securities and Exchange Commission office? No, really. It
promises all kinds of get-rich-quick schemes with no risk. Meanwhile,
believe it or not, the meanies at the Internal Revenue Service agree
that some people can file and pay their income taxes 10 days late
and, not to worry, there'll be no penalty.</LD>
<LD>   What gives? Actually, good news. The federal government, home of
some mini- and maxi-bungles over the years, has come up with a couple
of pretty good little ideas here. And since we all nail the
government for its celebrated stumbles, we probably ought to award
back pats when warranted.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC idea is clever. It's actually a scam of a scam to catch
potential scam victims before they're scammed. The SEC builds a fancy
Web site--www.mcwhortle.com--that purportedly makes battery-powered
biohazard detection devices. Sounds kind of cutting edge, doesn't it?
A pretty sophisticated, impressive site with video testimonials, it
offers maybe a 400% return in three months. Not as good as betting
the Patriots without points but not too shabby. Sign us up.</LD>
<TE>   But then: When you click to invest, a firm SEC warning appears
saying that you could get scammed by believing such stuff. The
education message gets right to the most gullible people at their
most vulnerable time. The commission also has similar sites, working
with government and police agencies to combat growing Internet fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Then here's President Bush, who dropped into his new budget a plan
to give taxpayers filing returns electronically an extra 10 days as
an incentive to boost participation. Apparently filing electronically
reduces, um,  misteaks. It's obviously quicker, saves the IRS money
and even provides an e-receipt. Never mind the seemingly
contradictory message of giving extra procrastination time to people
who can file faster.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the catch: The movable tax deadline requires the approval
of Congress, which like second-graders moves quickly only when it
comes to recess. Capitol Hill says it wants 80% of tax returns
e-filed by 2007; about 31% were last year. Alas, Congress and its
committee morass know no such thing as e-debate, e-voting or
e-xpediting. So there'll be no later filing deadline this year.
Still, the e-mergence from Washington of e-ncouraging ideas leaves us
for now strangely e-lated.</TE>

<HD>Detroit's Oil Riches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota and Honda are already mass-producing gasoline/electric hybrid
cars that get more than 50 miles per gallon. Plenty of conventional
cars get more than 30 miles per gallon and could do even better with
technology that already exists. Even a small boost in automobile gas
mileage would dramatically reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
None of that has moved Congress to update national fuel economy
standards, stuck for a decade at an average of 27.5 miles per gallon
for cars and 20.7 mpg for SUVs, minivans and other light trucks.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush too is dodging the issue. In the budget proposal he
released Monday he calls for an obvious stall: another study to
decide whether fuel economy standards could perhaps be raised.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently the only people in Washington with an ounce of guts
concerning auto mileage are Sens. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and John
McCain (R-Ariz.) and their allies. They are writing a bill requiring
manufacturers to improve car and light truck fuel economy by about 5%
in their 2005 models. The expected economies would increase over
time, saving 2.6 million barrels of oil daily by 2019--roughly the
amount the United States brings in each day from the entire Persian
Gulf.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to Congress last Friday, Transportation Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta parroted Detroit auto makers' latest argument
against raising fuel efficiency, claiming it would undermine
passenger safety. Mineta said he was "deeply concerned" about a
recent finding of the National Academy of Sciences that raising fuel
economy standards could cause "many additional traffic injuries and
fatalities."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the academy report concluded that "it is technically
feasible and potentially economical to improve fuel economy without
reducing vehicle weight or size and therefore without significantly
affecting the safety of motor vehicle travel." True, people driving
small cars are generally more vulnerable in collisions than people in
big ones. By this logic, all Americans should be driving General
Motors' new 6,400-pound, 13-mile-per-gallon Hummer model. Or why not
go whole hog with a Bradley-class tank?</TE>
<TE>   The alternative to such mad escalation is real energy
independence. If Bush won't act, Congress should stiffen its backbone
long enough to pass the Kerry-McCain plan. Then, as when every other
safety and fuel economy law was passed, Detroit will quit whining and
figure out how to build fast, sexy, practical cars that meet the
standards.</TE>

<LD>William F. Schulz subscribes to the notion that because some of these
countries are poor, throwing more money at the problem will thwart
terrorism ("To Curb Terrorism, Send Aid in Abundance," Commentary,
Feb. 4). How does he explain a wealthy country like Saudi Arabia,
with 95% of its male citizenry in support of Osama bin Laden? The
U.S. attempted to give Somalia humanitarian aid (physically and
monetarily). The result was U.S. military personnel murdered and
monetary aid divided up and squandered by Somali warlords. Yet we
continue to send Somalia money, and the Somalis' hatred of the U.S.
remains.</LD>
<LD>   Developing countries are now witnessing that there is no future in
practicing or aiding in terrorism, and appeasing them with cash makes
us look like fools.</LD>

the world is in the 21st century ("War Is Handy Politics for Bush,"
Commentary, Feb. 3). Nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   The members of the Axis started the Second World War because they
believed the nations that eventually united to defeat them were too
decadent and soft to go on to a true war footing and defeat them.
They were wrong then, and those making up the "axis" are wrong now.
They can be defeated. Their use of minions to spread their doctrine
of evil will stop when the boots are on the ground, just as it is
stopping in Afghanistan. These forms of government by terror of both
their own people and others will go the way of the Nazis, fascists
and militarists of Japan, if we are steadfast in our resolve to stop
them.</TE>

<TE>   Since America's liberation of Afghanistan, an international
peacekeeping force has brought security to the capital, Kabul.
However, Afghanistan's fragile peace will collapse if international
peacekeepers do not expand to protect the rest of the country. In the
absence of such an impartial authority, even well-meaning warlords
cannot demilitarize for fear of being persecuted by gun-toting
criminals. America should help expand the international peacekeeping
force to the rest of Afghanistan to provide security until a new
Afghan army can take over. Otherwise, Afghanistan will slip back into
anarchy and once again become a haven for terrorists and heroin
dealers.</TE>

<LD>In "So What If They Hate the U.S.?" (Commentary, Jan. 31), Edward
Bernard Glick nails the European liberal elite and its whining
cohorts here and abroad for what they are. No longer able to
significantly influence world events straightforwardly, they have
been reduced to the role of carping critics. Using the media as their
megaphone, they seek to retain some semblance of influence over
events by arguing that America must heed world opinion.</LD>
<LD>   Any U.S. slip (real, trivial or imagined) triggers an overweening
outrage in the hope that we will hesitate or reverse course. They're
like jackals attempting to distract the lion long enough to snatch a

sparking doubts on her fitness to govern and making her election

<HD>Sharon and Arafat: Two Sides, Same Coin</HD>

<LD>So, Ariel Sharon regrets not killing Yasser Arafat ("Sharon Sorry
Arafat Wasn't Killed in '82," Feb. 1). Seems like a nice guy to me.
Seems like someone whose values the world welcomes. Someone who wants
to kill those who disagree with him, especially political leaders,
along with women and children. Seems like someone the world would
benefit from doing business with, especially when it comes down to
the value of human lives.</LD>
<LD>   This is the man who doesn't have a better friend than America. The
kind of guy who will bottle up the political leader of an already
oppressed and impoverished people in order to have his way with them.
Doesn't sound like a terrorist to me. Nope.</LD>

<TE>   Sharon's comments regarding Arafat reveal Sharon to be very little
different from the Arab leaders he so openly despises.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of seeking avenues of peace he has openly provoked the
violent responses of the Palestinians and thumbed his nose at our
administration's feeble requests for dialogue. Now he is determined
to convince President Bush that he should also "boycott" Arafat and
simply let the Israeli army continue its pogrom unrestrained. Bush
will no doubt go along with him, since he doesn't really know any
better.</TE>
<TE>   There is no excuse for the cruelty of Palestinian suicide bombers,
nor is there one for the behavior of the Israeli army. It is obvious
that violence on either side has never done any good for anyone, yet
Sharon shows repeatedly that he just doesn't care. With "friends"
like that. . . .</TE>

<TE>   Dan Schochet seems to believe that Palestinians will applaud
terrorism no matter what, even "when the peace process seemed to be
working" (letter, Feb. 1).</TE>
<TE>   Is he referring to the period of the Oslo accords, during which a
high number of Jewish settlements were built in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, encroaching upon every Palestinian's sense of peace and
statehood?</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if he thinks the Palestinians should have applauded that
instead?</TE>

<TE>   Re Palestinian suicide bombers, Jan. 31: Many of us poignantly
remember the suicidal Buddhist monks during the Vietnam War, and even
one or two secular American youths, who protested that war by burning
themselves to death. I believe that young Palestinians resisting
Israeli occupation would be far more effective if they would
carefully blow up only themselves. Adding murder to suicide only
perpetuates and deepens the culture of revenge so endemic to the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The most effective tactic would certainly be nonviolent
resistance, as taught and employed by Thoreau, Gandhi and King.</TE>
<TE>   But if, in order to show the depths of their passion, Palestinians
feel blood must flow, then let it be their own. By killing innocent
noncombatants, they forfeit their chance to gain sympathy from their
oppressors and the Western world.</TE>
<TE>   They make themselves look like Al Qaeda terrorists instead,
deserving only further suppression, retaliation and imprisonment.</TE>

<LD>Re ''Enron's Ex-Chief Won't Testify,'' Feb. 4: Before we let the
Enron bus run away again, let's make sure what they are doing now is
aboveboard. Forget about Kenneth Lay for now; it is pretty obvious
that his case will now be dealt with by professional plaintiffs on
the government payroll.</LD>
<LD>   Let's have the new CEO [interim chief executive Stephen Cooper]
testify. Let's make sure the new guys are not going to slip under
regulatory scrutiny as they attempt to issue new debt and equity to
get Enron out of hock.</LD>

<TE>   Billionaires like Lay really do live on another planet. Suddenly,
on Sunday morning he realized it wouldn't be enough to have sent his
family ahead to vouch for his honesty, integrity and ''loving
father'' status. This appearance before the panel would not be a
piece of cake; the loss of life savings and jobs by thousands of
ordinary people is not a figment of someone's imagination to be wiped
away by his polite denial of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   After all, his wife said even they will have to sell two of their
houses. That makes everything equal. Really!</TE>

<TE>   Good for Ken Lay! So he decided to pass on the self-serving
''investigative'' congressional circus (10 committees at last count
are rooting through the Enron debacle). It seems the Enron employees
who appear before committees are simply vehicles for the posturing
and preening of our legislators, who gleefully trample the crime
scene. Why not cancel the committees and let the law enforcement
professionals do their work?</TE>

<TE>   It is the ultimate in chutzpah for the Bush administration to
complain that releasing information on its meeting with Enron
officials will erode the right of the executive branch to privately
consult with whomever it pleases, while at the same time it
introduces legislation and instructs its Justice Department to
monitor citizens' e-mails, eavesdrop on their cellular phone
conversations and gut their 4th Amendment rights ''to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures.''</TE>

<LD>Re "Despite Recession, Perks for Top Executives Grow," Feb. 1:
Company executives have long defended their practice of providing
lucrative bonuses on top of generous salaries on the need to attract
well-qualified personnel. As has been shown most notably in the Enron
case, this has not always benefited the rank-and-file employees or
the stockholders.</LD>
<LD>   Rewards for executives should be the result of the increased share
value based on their expert management skills. They should not be a
privileged class, secretively rewarded independent of the company
performance. Obscuring these benefits in the financial reports needs
to be corrected. Eliminating them as a tax-deductible business
expense is something Congress can do. Doing so may cause these to go
the way of the three-martini lunch.</LD>

<HD>Queuing Up for Different Kind of Wait at the DMV</HD>
<DH>In an effort to reduce long lines, the agency is rolling
out a statewide computerized version of take-a-number system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sick of the long lines at the DMV?</LD>
<LD>   The head of the state Department of Motor Vehicles says big change
is on the way.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Gourley promises that the expansion of a "queuing system"
to branch offices statewide will end that notorious DMV staple:
waiting in line.</LD>
<TE>   The new plan for managing customers, Gourley said, is "the biggest
thing since sliced bread."</TE>
<TE>   That Steve, what a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the "DMV-Q system" has not eliminated lines in every
office where it is used. And many customers who have experienced the
"Q" say it's hardly an efficiency revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The system is simply a computerized version of the take-a-number
setup used at delis and bakeries. Disneyland uses a similar plan,
called FastPass, to keep lines moving at the Happiest Place on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Here is how it works at the DMV: You walk in and get a number
based on the transaction you need to complete. You then take a seat
and wait for your number to be called.</TE>
<TE>   Simple enough, right?</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the "Q" has been installed in 29 of the state's 170
DMV offices. Officials say it has worked so well that it will be
added to every DMV office, beginning with 33 more over the next 12
months, including 13 in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Priority service is supposed to go to those with quick, simple
tasks, such as renewing car registrations. More complicated
transactions, such as transferring title to a car, still may require
long waits.</TE>
<TE>   By prioritizing customers, DMV officials claim the system cuts the
overall wait time by 30% to 50%. Surveys in a handful of offices
showed a positive reaction from customers, DMV officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Gourley wasn't the only DMV official gushing about the new "Q."
DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said many customers are reacting with,
"Hooray!"</TE>
<TE>   That's not the word Max Vivar used to describe his experience with
the new system. A retired machinist from Baldwin Park, Vivar said he
recently spent 4 1/2 hours at the DMV's West Covina office trying to
fix the misspelling of his name on his driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   The "Q" system was installed in West Covina last year. Imagine
what Vivar's wait would have been without it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not great," he said. "It's just a patch."</TE>
<TE>   As he complained on the front steps of the DMV office on a recent
chilly morning, a line of about 15 people began to form behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Just to enter the West Covina office, folks had to wait in line
for a single DMV worker to ask them about their transaction and
assign them a number. The line began to form near the front door and
snaked onto the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see why people have to stand in line when they collect so
much money," Vivar said, fuming as he walked to his car.</TE>
<TE>   The West Covina line was not unique. About an hour later at the
DMV office in Whittier, a dozen or so people waited in a line that
stretched out the front door. The same was true at the Culver City
office, although the line there was about half the length.</TE>
<TE>   Gourley, the DMV chief, might want to tone down this no-more-lines
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Sanchez, a social services worker from La Mirada who spent
nearly 1 1/2 hours at the Whittier office to renew his car
registration, said he didn't see an advantage to the new system.</TE>
<TE>   "If you just have to get your tags, you should be expedited,"
Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what, Ray? That's exactly what the new system is supposed to
do.</TE>
<TE>   DMV customers at several offices said they were pleased that the
new system allows them to sit while waiting. But not everyone was so
lucky. At the Whittier and West Covina offices, all of the seats were
taken by midmorning, forcing a handful of folks at each location to
stand.</TE>
<TE>   There is a new scene at DMV offices with the "Q" system. Gone are
the excruciatingly long, roped-off lines that zigzag through crowded
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Now necks are craned upward as everyone watches television
monitors hanging from the ceiling, flashing the all-important
numbers. A pleasant, recorded female voice announces the lucky digits
every few seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The system may sound stunningly simple. But it includes a few
nuances that can be a killer if they are misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting at the Whittier office for more than an hour to get
a copy of his driving record, Barry Kelperis, a truck driver from
Walnut, could take it no more. He decided to get some lunch and come
back later.</TE>
<TE>   "The DMV is the DMV," he said, huffing. "It's the same old wait."</TE>
<TE>   Kelperis said he was not worried about losing his place in the
system because his number had the letter "H" before it. The voice on
the intercom had just started announcing numbers preceded by the
letter "B." He figured there were six letters to go before he would
be called.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong. Numbers and letters are not called in sequence. Instead,
the letters represent the type of transaction each customer must
complete. For example, numbers that are preceded by an "A" are for
car registration renewals. Numbers with a "C" are for new driver's
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Said DMV spokesman Steve Haskins: "We really don't recommend that
you leave the office."</TE>
<TE>   For all the hype about the "Q" system, Haskins said it has yet to
make a systemwide impact at the DMV, where the average wait time
remains 25 minutes. He expects that figure to drop once the system is
further expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold your breath, said Perry Kenny, president of the
California State Employees Assn., which includes about 8,000 DMV
workers.</TE>
<TE>   He said the cure for the long waits is not a more sophisticated
queuing system but more DMV offices and more DMV workers.</TE>
<TE>   California has the nation's worst ratio of full-time employees in
all state agencies--106 workers per 10,000 residents, Kenny said. New
York, for example, has 137 full-time employees per 10,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV has not opened a new office since 1996, while the number
of registered cars has increased from 26 million to 28.5 million in
that time, Kenny said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only live bodies can deal with that," he said, "not computers."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to respond, the DMV's Haskins said he would not comment on
union matters.</TE>

<DH>Miller Quickly Goes From an Afterthought to the U.S.'s Best
Hope for Gold</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. skier with the best shot at winning gold at Salt Lake City
did not make the preseason media guide's section listing Olympic
medal hopefuls, and it was no editing mistake.</LD>
<LD>   It makes only more remarkable what Bode Miller has accomplished
since November. With little warning, Miller has gone from mysterious
to magnificent and has to be considered one of the favorites in both
Olympic technical races--the slalom and giant slalom.</LD>
<LD>   What precipitated this rise was sort of a ski racing harmonic
convergence. Miller, 24, began his fourth season in a fog of
uncertainty, on the mend from a serious knee injury suffered at last
year's World Championships and on the minds of coaches who wondered
if the strong-willed gate racer would ever conform.</LD>
<TE>   The answer came early, over Thanksgiving weekend, when Miller
bounded from the 54th start position to finish second in a World Cup
slalom at Aspen, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Since, he has become the most talked about technical skier on the
U.S. scene since brothers Phil and Steve Mahre made tracks in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Since firing that slalom salvo in Aspen, Miller has gone overseas
and won four World Cup races--three slaloms and one giant slalom. His
Dec. 9 GS victory at Val d'Isere, France, marked the first World Cup
win in the discipline by an American male since Phil Mahre in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Miller followed with a slalom victory in Italy on Dec. 10 and
another Jan. 6 at Adelboden, Switzerland. In that race, he defeated
second-place finisher Ivica Kostelic by an astonishing 1.92
seconds--the skiing equivalent of winning a 100-meter race by 10
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has also posted a second-place finish in GS and third in
slalom.</TE>
<TE>   After his second World Cup win, in Italy, Miller said, "Imagine
working your entire life and watching all your dreams and all your
aspirations come true, all at once."</TE>
<TE>   God-given ability was never Miller's problem. He carved up courses
for years as a ski protege growing up in New Hampshire, yet arrived
to the ski team with his own agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The knock on him up to the opening races this season was that he
took too many chances and not enough advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a little rebel in him, no question about that," Jesse
Hunt, his coach, says. "That has actually worked to his advantage in
a lot of ways, but in terms of maturity it has slowed down his
process."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches wanted Miller to hold back a bit on his risk-taking, and
Miller resisted. In technical events, a racer needs to negotiate the
fine line between speed and control.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I haven't been trying to make the right decisions,"
Miller said after his podium finish in Aspen, "but you can only do
what you can do. It's hard to ease back."</TE>
<TE>   Miller has obviously discovered the right touch and heads into the
Olympics with incredible momentum.</TE>
<TE>   He knows, though, that winning a medal takes more than skill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a one-shot deal," he says. "You have once chance at it and
if you can pull it off, you get your rewards. Really, it's the
essence of the sport, but there's a painful reality when you miss by
a hundredth of a second or you hook a tip on the last gate."</TE>

<LD>   Downhill: Hermann Maier's withdrawal because of injuries was
supposed to give others a chance to win one of the Olympics'
signature events. Instead, Austrian teammate Stephan Eberharter has
stepped into the void and dominated, having already won the two most
prestigious downhill races on the World Cup circuit: at Wengen,
Switzerland, and Kitzbuehel, Austria. Eberharter will be almost the
odds-on favorite to win the Olympic downhill as Maier would have
been. Others to watch include Kjetil Andre Aamodt (Norway), Kurt
Sulzenbacher (Italy), Didier Cuche (Switzerland) and any number of
up-and-coming Austrians. Daron Rahlves is America's only medal hope.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Combined: This event rewards all-around excellence, combining the
times of two slalom runs and a downhill to produce a champion. You
have to like the Norwegians here--Lasse Kjus and Aamodt. They
finished one-two in combined at the 1994 Lillehammer Games and are
still formidable almost a decade later. Aamodt recently won the
combined titles at Wengen and Kitzbuehel, with Kjus finishing second
to Aamodt in the second race. Austrian slalom star Mario Matt might
have been a contender but injured his shoulder in Kitzbuehel and will
miss the Olympics. America's combined chances of winning are zero.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Super-G: Rahlves is the reigning world champion and the man the
Austrians fear most on any given day. Traditionally a slow starter,
Rahlves appears to be back on track after recently finishing fourth
in Kitzbuehel. Austria's Eberharter will be the favorite after
sweeping downhill and super-G at the famed Hannenkam. Other medal
contenders include Cuche of Switzerland and Austria's Christoph
Gruber. The U.S. has little depth behind Rahlves now that Chad
Fleischer has been lost after tearing knee ligaments in a downhill
crash last month in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slalom: America's Bode Miller might not have needed help to win a
medal, but he got some when Austria's Matt suffered the shoulder
injury. Miller is one of the hottest skiers on the World Cup circuit,
although he will be challenged by Croatia's Ivica Kostelic, Italy's
Giorgio Rocca of Italy and Austria's Rainer Schoenfelder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giant Slalom: Miller posted the first World Cup victory of his
career with a GS win in December at Val d'Isere, but the competition
is fierce, led by France's Frederic Covili, Sweden's Fredrik Nyberg
and Austria's Benjamin Raich. Also, don't count out Eberharter, who
won a silver medal in GS at Nagano. America's Erik Schlopy, third in
final GS standings last year, has been slowed this year by illness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   Downhill: Picabo Street, Olympic silver medallist in downhill at
Lillehammer and winner of the gold medal in super-G at Nagano, would
gladly take a bronze in Salt Lake to complete the set. Street is
coming off horrific injuries suffered in a 1998 crash but may have
one run left in her beat-up body. It's significant that she won a
Nor-Am race on the Olympic course last March. Teammate Kirsten Clark
broke through last year with a downhill win and has been consistently
strong this season. The best bet to win, though, is probably
Germany's Hilde Gerg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Combined: The U.S. sent 18-year-old Caroline Lalive to the 1998
Nagano Games to get experience, and she finished a surprising
seventh. Four years later, she remains America's strongest all-event
skier, narrowly missing a medal in combined at last year's World
Championships. Defending Olympic champion Katja Seizinger has
retired, but German teammate Gerg, who won the bronze in 1998,
returns to challenge for the gold along with Austria's Michaela
Dorfmeister.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Super-G: This event will be raced in the memory of France's Regine
Cavagnoud, the reigning super-G world champion and World Cup title
holder, who died earlier this season after colliding with a coach on
a training run. Lalive and Clark of the U.S. are top-10 contenders.
Street will be unable to defend her Olympic title because she is not
ranked high enough in the standings. Dorfmeister may have the most
motivation, having lost the gold medal to Street in 1998 by
one-hundredth of a second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giant Slalom: Did we mention Dorfmeister? Her World Cup win in GS
at Berchtesgaden, Germany, in January proved she will be a
multi-medal threat. The gold medal might come down to her or
Switzerland's Sonja Nef. Sarah Schleper is one of America's bright
young hopes and seems to be building momentum headed to Salt Lake in
this event after finishing 10th at a recent World Cup in Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slalom: Kristina Koznick trains separately from the U.S. team, but
it hasn't stopped her from posting top-notch numbers. She most
recently recorded the fifth World Cup victory of her career with a
slalom win in Berchtesgaden and ranks near the top of the World Cup
slalom standings. Koznick will be looking to make amends for 1998,
when she faltered after being one of the favorites to win gold.
Schleper can also be a factor here.</TE>

<LD>   Women's 15k: Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden is the dominant female
biathlete in the world. She should win the gold medal in every
individual women's event. Forsberg has won five straight World Cup
championships and has a significant lead in the standings this year.
Normally a terrific shooter with the .22-caliber rifle, Forsberg was
off target in Nagano and didn't win a medal. That should change in
Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Men's 20k: The Germans are strong here with Frank Luck and Sven
Fischer considered contenders, along with Russia's Pavel Rostovtsev,
the World Cup leader. The young American team has been pointing for
this home-country Olympics for years. No American has ever won a
biathlon medal, but Jay Hakkinen of Kasilof, Alaska, a two-time
Olympian, won a world junior championship in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men's 10k Sprint: Ole Einar Bjorndalen of Norway won gold in this
event four years ago and could well do it again. Norway is
traditionally strong in biathlon, and this Olympics should not be any
different. American Jeremy Teela of Anchorage, Alaska, took ninth
place in the world senior championships in 2001. Another top
contender is Raphael Poiree of France.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women's 7.5k Sprint: Once you get past Forsberg, 1998 medalist
Ursula Disl of Germany, Olena Zubrilova of Ukraine, and Liv Grete
Poiree of Norway--who is married to Raphael Poiree--loom as the most
likely medal contenders. The United States has no chance for a medal.
The only member of the American team who has scored World Cup points
this year is Rachel Steer of Anchorage. Steer has 12 U.S. junior and
senior titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men's 12.5k Pursuit: A new event on the Olympic calendar in the
cross-country ski-shooting discipline. The first half of the race,
with competitors leaving the starting line in a staggered start, is a
10k. The top 60 racers advance to the second half of the race, a
12.5k, with racers departing the starting line based on how far apart
they finished in the first race. Once again Bjorndalen should be
formidable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women's 10k Pursuit: If Forsberg skis and shoots the way she has
in all world-class competition except for the Nagano Olympics, there
is no reason to be believe she will be beaten. Poiree can be a factor
here and Olga Pyleva of Russia, performing well on the World Cup
tour, should also be in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men's Relay: Germany seems to have the most depth. But neither
Norway nor Russia can be counted out. The U.S. doesn't have the
necessary depth to be a factor in the race and can only hope for a
satisfactory result.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women's Relay: Forsberg doesn't have the backup needed for Sweden
to be a medal winner. That leaves the usual suspect countries of
Germany, Norway and Russia to fight it out and share the medals.</TE>

<DH>Strange Sport With Funny Rules and Terminology Is Becoming
an Olympic Mainstay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's because the name of the sport prompts visions of little
girls getting their hair done. Maybe it's because one of the key
pieces of equipment is a mundane household implement, the lowly
broom. Maybe it's because the game seems to many a combination of
bowling and shuffleboard, activities that stand none too tall in the
hierarchy of sports.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the reason, people like to make fun of curling, an
Olympic medal sport for the second time in these Salt Lake City
Games. After all, there is something, um, different about a game that
involves a bunch of polished rocks with handles and is played on a
long, narrow sheet of ice with target circles at either end. And
speaking of ends, that's what the playing periods are called.</LD>
<LD>   Do curlers care what people say? Some of the sensitive souls
might, but most cock their tams at rakish angles--the sport
originated in Scotland--and go about their curling.</LD>
<TE>   Said Tim Somerville, skip--that's captain--of the U.S. men's team,
"That stuff doesn't bother me. I've played the game awhile.... That
stuff doesn't hurt my feelings one bit."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, curling is a lot more athletic than some other Olympic
sports.</TE>
<TE>   As mentioned, curling originated in Scotland, probably in the 16th
century, when farmers curled on the frozen marshes, using what they
called "channel stones," rocks smoothed by flowing water. One player
slid a stone across the ice while partners with brooms swept snow
from the stone's path. Scottish immigrants later brought the game to
North America, first to Canada, then to the United States--primarily
the upper Midwest--and it spread to the European continent as well.</TE>
<TE>   These days, nobody goes out to the marshes to curl. The sport is
played indoors, on refrigerated ice in places with locker rooms,
snack bars, all the conveniences. If it has a modern look about it,
though, it remains true to its roots--rocks and brooms.</TE>
<TE>   Curling involves two teams--they're called rinks--each with four
players. They alternate sliding--curling--the 42-pound granite rocks,
each player casting two stones down the 146-foot sheet to a 12-foot
target area known as the house. The center of the house is called the
tee, and each stone closer to the tee than the opponents' is good for
a point. Since a good shot can be knocked away by an opponent's shot,
the game is full of strategy, offensive and defensive.</TE>
<TE>   It also is truly a team sport, with every player involved in each
of his team's shots. Until it's his turn to curl, the skip normally
stands behind the house, directing his players' shots. The two other
players who aren't shooting wield the brooms for the one who is,
sweeping vigorously to reduce the friction between stone and ice,
thus helping the stone along, not quite so vigorously if the rock is
proceeding at a higher speed toward the house.</TE>
<TE>   A game consists of 10 ends. When each player from each team has
curled his rocks, that's the end--of that period. Then they turn
around and slide their stones back the way they came. It's not unlike
football teams turning around and going the other way after each
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the Olympics, 10 teams, up from eight last time around, will
compete in round-robin play leading to the medal playoffs in each of
the men's and women's divisions. The U.S., as host nation, will have
teams in both but would have qualified anyway on World Championship
finishes the last three years. The Somerville rink of Roseville,
Minn., the U.S. men's team, is a veteran group that won four national
championships in the '90s. Three of the four Somerville curlers were
on the U.S. team that finished fourth at Nagano four years ago. Kari
Erickson's national championship rink from Bemidji, Minn., the
women's team, has two Nagano veterans, Debbie McCormick and Stacey
Liapis, Erickson's sister. The U.S. women tied for fifth in 1998.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: The stone in curling doesn't roll, it slides. Sandra
Schmirler of Canada releases the 42-pound rock during the Nagano
Games in 1998, the first year the sport--which originated in
Scotland, probably in the 16th century--was included in the Olympics.</CP>

<LD>Men: Canada is the traditional power, but Switzerland upset the
Canadians in the gold-medal game at Nagano, and Sweden won the world
title last year. Peter Lindholm, winner of two world championships,
skips the Swedish team, and Canadian skip Greg McAulay led his rink
to the world title in 2000. The veteran Somerville curlers,
representing the U.S., figure to be in contention for a medal.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Women: Again, Canada is the power, as defending Olympic champion
and world champion the last two years. Four-time world champion
Elisabeth Gustafson skips the dangerous Swedish team, and skip Dordi
Norby of Norway has won 77 times in world competition. Kari
Erickson's team could earn new respect for the U.S. by making the
medal round.</LD>

<HD>He Rules Air Ways</HD>
<DH>U.S. Expects Another Gold From Bergoust; He Expects to
Deliver It</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ski jumping looks dangerous, right? Secret: The jumpers fly far but
are really not more than a few feet off the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Platform diving in the Summer Games, now that's a long fall, yes?
True, but they typically start a mere 40 feet above the water.</LD>
<LD>   You want big air? That's aerial skiing: Rocket off a ramp, fly 60
feet up, execute some twists and flips in the manner of a world-class
gymnast, then land gracefully on skis.</LD>
<TE>   No one in the world is better at this demanding athletic ballet
than Eric Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., who won gold in Nagano in 1998
and is heavily favored to win gold again in Salt Lake City. "Live
life," Bergoust is fond of saying, "with the passion of an artist."</TE>
<TE>   Now 32, Bergoust has been dedicated to aerial skiing since he was
13. "I think he's jumping better than he ever has," U.S. Coach Jeff
Wintersteen said.</TE>
<TE>   Bergoust said, "I feel better than I did five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, Bergoust wanted to be a stunt man or a fighter pilot. He
loved bouncing on the trampoline. For kicks, he would jump off the
chimney of the family house. For a really fun time, he would jump off
a trampoline placed by a roadside bridge--making it appear to passing
motorists as if he was jumping into the great beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't do it," he now says to those who might emulate his
unorthodox ways. "I was a highly trained crazy little kid."</TE>
<TE>   Bergoust was the first person through the gate to see aerial
skiing make its debut in 1988 as an Olympic demonstration sport in
Calgary. To him, the competitors seemed like royalty. So he set about
becoming one of them.</TE>
<TE>   He drove to a training center in Lake Placid, N.Y., in a beat-up
car, arriving with $10 in his pocket. He used the money to buy corn
flakes, powdered milk, honey, bread, peanut butter and jelly; that's
what he ate for a week--breakfast, lunch and dinner--until he earned
his first paycheck waiting tables.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, he jumped. And jumped. And jumped.</TE>
<TE>   In Nagano, Bergoust crashed onto his chest during a practice jump.
He says now that it felt as if he couldn't even take a deep breath.
Then he went out and notched what was then the highest composite
score recorded in aerials competition. "I can be happy forever now,"
he recalls thinking at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe not, he admits now. "I've had to put my last win out of
my mind to be motivated to do something better," he said, adding that
when he's done competing, "I think I'll enjoy it more."</TE>
<TE>   Added motivation comes from U.S. ski officials, who are aiming for
a total of 10 medals in the various disciplines--aerial, mogul,
Alpine, snowboarding, Nordic--at the Games. One of those 10, they
figure, has got to be Bergoust's.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, Bergoust said. It's good to set goals. And, he said, "It's
important to not be afraid to fail."</TE>

<LD>MEN</LD>
<LD>   Moguls: Jeremy Bloom, 19, took a year off from playing football at
Colorado to chase his Olympic dream--with no guarantees he would make
the Olympic team. Sometimes things really work out. Bloom heads to
Salt Lake as the leader in the World Cup points race and heads an
American moguls squad deep in talent. Jonny Mosely, for example, won
gold in Nagano. Evan Dybvig was a '98 Olympian. And Travis Mayer--a
student at Cornell--has capped a stunning rise from the junior ranks.
Janne Lahtela and Mikko Ronkainen, both of Finland, are the most
likely challengers from abroad.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Aerials: Eric Bergoust is the man to beat. If Bergoust is slightly
off, look for Alexei Grichin of Belarus or Ales Valenta of the Czech
Republic to step up. Valenta is the only competitor to complete five
twists in one aerial maneuver; if conditions are right, he may
attempt the move at the Games. Americans Brian Currutt, who has three
top-10 finishes this season, and Joe Pack are also legitimate medal
threats; Pack let last year's World Cup title slip away to Bergoust
in large part because of problems on his final jump of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   Moguls: Shannon Bahrke likes to wear glitter before she rocks down
the mogul course. It pumps her up, she says. Glittery "Sparky"
Bahrke, as she's known, and another American, Hannah Hardaway, figure
to compete for medals. But Kari Traa of Norway, the bronze medalist
at Lillehammer in 1994 and last year's World Cup champion, goes in
with the best chance for gold.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aerials: Jacqui Cooper of Australia--that's right, Australia,
known worldwide for many things but not mountains or snow--is the
best in the world. Other top competitors include Alla Tsuper of
Belarus and Nagano silver medalist Xu Nannan of China. Emily Cook of
Belmont, Mass., the top American aerialist, bowed out of the Games
after suffering a foot injury in a training crash Jan. 17 at Lake
Placid.</TE>

<HD>Air-Proof Argument</HD>
<DH>Alborn Wants to Show His Family That All the Sacrifices
Were Worthwhile</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is peaceful in the sky. When he is in the air, skis pointed
outward in a V, Alan Alborn could be a bird with ear plugs. The crowd
beneath him is roaring, but he hears nothing.</LD>
<LD>   He flies off the 120-meter hill, folds his body forward, and
soars. If his form is just right, he lands smoothly and skis to a
halt more than 200 meters from takeoff.</LD>
<LD>   Ski jumping is a European sport and Americans have never excelled
at it. A soft-spoken, bleached-blond kid who just became old enough
to drink aims to change that. And not only show the family he has
barely seen for six years the sacrifices were worth it, but bring a
smile to the face of the frail, wheelchair-bound old man who
discovered him.</LD>
<TE>   Alborn, 21, of Anchorage, has grown up on tour. Once, top
competitors ignored him. If recent results are any indication--three
top-six World Cup finishes this winter--he must be reckoned with at
the 2002 Games. At the least, he is a wild card, someone
unpredictable enough to fear.</TE>
<TE>   Is Alborn a medal contender?</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm pretty close," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jumpers usually don't peak until their late 20s, so Alborn is a
pup. But he has been at it a long time. Skiing, flying, and the
Alaska wilderness are Alborn's greatest joys. To get ahead when he
combined the first two he had to forfeit most of his sojourns to the
latter.</TE>
<TE>   Dave and Mary Alborn thought their kids would be Alpine skiers.
They dropped them off at a small slope in Anchorage. Nearby was the
Karl Eid Ski Jump Complex, named for the man who was a one-man local
proselytizer for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The jumpers fascinated Alborn. He sneaked over from the ski area
and, although his parents tried to discourage him, they eventually
gave in. Mary Alborn remembers pausing, though, when presented with a
ski jumping release form. She was sure her son was going to break his
neck.</TE>
<TE>   Where she envisioned casts, however, Karl Eid saw potential.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an absolute talent," Eid said.</TE>
<TE>   Eid, 92, grew up in Germany's Black Forest region. At the
Garmisch-Partenkirchen Winter Olympics of 1936, he worked as a
conditioning coach for the German team. He was wounded during World
War II and lost a leg. More recently his other leg was amputated
because of circulation problems.</TE>
<TE>   Eid, who came to the United States in 1956 and moved to Alaska in
1959, started the Alaska ski jumping program in 1974. Although he
doesn't get out much anymore, he still offers basic instruction to
youngsters in his living room.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn is the prize pupil, and Eid will be riveted to his
television set during the Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   For all of his devotion to ski jumping, what really attracted
Alborn to the event was its kinship with flying. His dad is a cargo
pilot and Alborn owns a Cessna 185, which he parks on a lake in
Anchorage and which he got to fly for only 30 minutes last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, people always teased me about ski jumping,
that it was the closest thing I could get to flying," Alborn said.
"It was really half true."</TE>
<TE>   Alborn, who has jumped a U.S. record 210 meters, said that in the
air the jumper drinks in the scene in slow motion. He said jumpers
get their oomph from their legs and he has improved the speed of
orders from the brain to the legs.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to seem like it took 10 seconds," he said. "Now it's
immediate. You have to be really light and strong and like to fly."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he passed his 15th birthday, Alborn had progressed
beyond what Eid and other local coaches could show him. He moved to
Colorado, went to school there for a year and jumped on full-sized
hills. After that, Alborn became a ski jumping vagabond, foregoing
formal high school, traveling through Europe with demanding U.S. team
coach Kari Ylianttila.</TE>
<TE>   He made only cameo visits to Alaska, dashing to the family cabin
100 miles north of Anchorage, rarely seeing his parents, brothers and
sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn loves ski jumping, but he feels the absence of some of
those things keenly.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I started traveling, I feel like I missed out on a
lot," he said. "All of high school. Friends. You trade off things. My
only friends my age are ski jumpers."</TE>
<TE>   One of the things Alborn trades off is body fat. He is 5-feet-11
and wants to weigh 127 or 128. He said he weighs 130. The lighter you
are, the farther you fly, so he has been living on chicken, rice and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn has quashed his appetite in order to get better. And he is
improving steadily. He won his first national title in 1999, on the
120-meter hill, his best Olympic event, and added another last year,
when he became the first American to jump more than 200 meters. This
winter he had three top-six World Cup finishes in a month. And he won
the Gold Cup title in Utah in December to nab an automatic Olympic
berth.</TE>
<TE>   "He' s definitely been making progress every year," Ylianttila
said. "In ski jumping, progress is usually pretty slow. It takes time
to learn technique. Younger guys improve much faster. Older, more
mature athletes do better. He still needs to get stronger and
quicker. The potential is there."</TE>
<TE>   Ylianttila, a 1980 Finnish Olympian, said Alborn has the chance to
raise the profile of his sport in this country, but isn't predicting
a medal this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe not right now," Ylianttila said. "He could put it all
together. It has happened in the past. But there aren't any surprise
winners in ski jumping anymore."</TE>

<LD>   K90 (small hill): Adam Malysz of Poland and Sven Hannawald of
Germany have dominated the World Cup circuit, and it would be a
tremendous upset if one of them did not take the gold medal. Matti
Hautemaki of Finland is the best of the rest, and someone from
Finland almost always comes through. Martin Schmitt of Germany and
Martin Hoellworth of Austria should be watched. The Japanese peaked
on home territory at Nagano in 1998 but have been slumping this
season. An American medal is unlikely in this event.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   K120 (big hill): The big guns, Malysz and Hannawald seem head and
shoulders above other contenders. Even so, someone often enough flies
in and surprises. Alan Alborn, the top American, is at his best on
the large hill and three times this winter has placed in the top six
in World Cup competition. With the Games on American soil, the
home-hill advantage could come into play and earn the U.S. its first
medal in this event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team: The nations with the most depth, and the four jumpers needed
to perform, are probably Germany, Finland and Austria. The Finns
always believe they should win this event. And although the Japanese
have not had a first-rate season with top jumpers challenging at the
top of the World Cup standings, they may have enough depth to score a
medal on the right day.</TE>

<TE>   With five wins apiece, Germany's Ronny Ackermann and Austria's
Felix Gottwald have dominated the World Cup this season. Two U.S.
skiers, Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong, are the only others to win an
event.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time Olympian Lodwick, the best hope to be the first U.S.
medalist ever in this amalgam of ski jumping and cross-country
skiing, is ailing of late. One-day sprint event is a new addition to
program.</TE>

<HD>Golden Goal</HD>
<DH>Respected and Admired, Kwan Can Seal Her Place in History
With Gold Medal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through all the changes in her life, as she grew from a cute little
jumping bean into a mature artist and world champion, Michelle Kwan
has been driven by one unwavering passion.</LD>
<LD>   Her goal is to attain a kind of athletic immortality, to be
revered by figure skating fans and historians as a legend long after
she has landed her last triple loop.</LD>
<LD>   "Not necessarily for the number of medals, but just to be
remembered as someone who made an impact on figure skating and left a
lasting impression," she said after winning her fourth world title
last year. "Someone who made it better."</LD>
<TE>   The thought is never far from her mind. "I always ask myself,
'What do I want them to remember?'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   The height of a double axel jump, the position of a spin, the
edging of a spiral? Or her resilience and consistent excellence in an
era when skaters compete in two or three times as many events in a
season as their predecessors did?</TE>
<TE>   Her wish would be fulfilled if she wins the gold medal at the Salt
Lake City Winter Games. It's the one major prize she has not claimed,
and it would be the ultimate affirmation of her choice to remain
Olympic eligible after finishing an achingly close second to
compatriot Tara Lipinski at Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The desire has always been there, ever since I watched Brian
Boitano win the 1988 Olympics," she said. "I'm going to try and
represent my country well. You just have to keep your head down and
skate from your heart."</TE>
<TE>   If that's not good enough, will she still belong on a pedestal in
the eyes of historians--and in her own mind?</TE>
<TE>   "If she doesn't win, it will be a disappointment for her, even
though maybe she goes into it thinking she just wants to deliver the
best performances," said Katarina Witt, the 1984 and 1988 gold
medalist from East Germany and the only woman besides Sonja Henie to
win consecutive Olympic titles.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, the Olympic gold medal is it, and there is only a
small group of those elite gold-medal winners because the Games are
only every four years. The gold medal is something very, very special
for an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   That Kwan merits a niche among the sport's elite is beyond
question.</TE>
<TE>   In winning her sixth U.S. title last month at Staples Center, she
tied Theresa Weld Blanchard and Gretchen Merrill for second behind
Maribel Vinson, who won nine in the 1920s and 1930s. With four world
titles, she's second among U.S. women to Carol Heiss, who won five.
Overall, she's tied for the fourth-most world titles with Lily
Kronberger of Hungary and Witt, behind the five won by Heiss and
Herma Jaross-Szabo of Austria and the 10 won by Norway's Henie.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to hear my name in the same breath is amazing," she said
after she passed Janet Lynn, Peggy Fleming and Tenley Albright on the
list of U.S. women's titlists.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, no list can quantify Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   In many sports, greatness can be divined from numbers. Batting
averages, touchdown passes, rebounds, goals and assists measure
athletes' performances.</TE>
<TE>   But because so much of figure skating is subjective, it's
impossible to render absolute judgments. What pleases one eye is
unsightly to another; some observers value line and carriage over
jumps, while others put a premium on athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   Titles are not absolute indicators, because they might reflect who
was best for a day or two, not a season. Choreographer Sandra Bezic,
who has designed programs for Olympic champions Lipinski, Kristi
Yamaguchi and Boitano, considers Lynn the best skater she ever saw.</TE>
<TE>   "She never won a gold medal, but Janet was the most exquisite
skater to ever watch," said Bezic, who will be a commentator on NBC's
Olympic telecasts. "She had an ethereal quality about her. We used to
call her Janet of Arc. Her expression, her artistry, everything was
exquisite. She transcended everything really, and I don't think
anyone has come close."</TE>
<TE>   In that vein, Bezic says Kwan has already made such an impression
that she need not win the gold to be classified as extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "She certainly doesn't need it to be the most respected," Bezic
said. "I don't think she has anything left to prove. She's proven
time and time again she's a tough competitor and she comes through
under pressure.... She's certainly a really well-balanced competitor
in terms of technical ability and artistry, which is hard because
usually a skater favors one or another."</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, the 1968 gold medalist and a commentator for ABC, also
believes a victory at Salt Lake City would merely burnish Kwan's
already golden image.</TE>
<TE>   "An Olympic medal would be the frosting on the cake and would be a
real bonus for her," Fleming said. "It would be really well deserved.
She's tried so hard and she has been such a great role model.</TE>
<TE>   "She's right up there with the best. She will go down in skating
history as one of the enduring ones. She's been on top so long, and
that's the toughest place to be."</TE>
<TE>   And yet ...</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympic gold medal should be part of her gold-medal
collection. I think it's very, very important," Witt said. "[If she
doesn't win] it won't take anything away from how much of a great
figure skater and great athlete she is. But there will be always this
little thing where you think, 'Oh, God, I wish. That should have been
part of my gold-medal collection.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rating the Champions</TE>
<TE>   In the pantheon of female figure skaters, Henie reigns supreme.
She won 10 consecutive world titles from 1927 to '36 and Olympic gold
medals in 1928, '32 and '36. She then carved out successful careers
in ice shows and movies, inspiring countless kids to lace up skates.
No one is likely to duplicate her dominance.</TE>
<TE>   But after Henie, there's no obvious ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Albright earns a place on any list of greats for having won silver
at Oslo in 1952 and gold at Cortina, Italy, in 1956. Heiss, too, for
winning silver at Cortina and gold at Squaw Valley in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, the first U.S. woman medalist after the plane crash that
killed the 1961 U.S. figure skating team, won five U.S. titles from
1964 to '68 and three world titles from 1966 to '68. She was good at
tracing compulsory figures, which then counted heavily in the final
score, and was known for her grace and classical line.</TE>
<TE>   Her victory at Grenoble, marred by two faulty jumps, was the only
gold won by a U.S. athlete. It made her an instant star, to her
surprise. "It was just one more accomplishment. It didn't hit me
until years later," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Hamill became a household name in winning at Innsbruck in
1976, exuding a girl-next-door appeal. She was endearing, too vain to
wear glasses in the kiss-and-cry area and always squinting to read
her marks.</TE>
<TE>   She won without doing a triple jump, but she had the good fortune
to have a name that rhymed with a skating maneuver, the camel, which
was renamed the Hamill Camel. She was athletic and artistic, but
she's probably remembered as much for her wedge haircut, which was
copied by millions of women, as for her skating.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Fratianne of Northridge advanced the sport by making the
triple jump a necessity for women, and she won four U.S. titles and
two world titles. She was the favorite in the 1980 Lake Placid Games
but was too far behind Anett Poetzsch after the compulsory figures
and finished second.</TE>
<TE>   Witt, powerful and provocative, won four world titles in five
years from 1984 to '88. She defeated world champion Rosalynn Sumners
of the U.S. to win gold at Sarajevo in 1984 and out dueled U.S.
champion Debi Thomas at the 1988 Calgary Games after both chose
"Carmen" for their free skate.</TE>
<TE>   "Kat's fantastic, perhaps the strongest competitor I've ever
seen," said Bezic, who choreographs for the Stars on Ice tour, in
which Witt now performs.</TE>
<TE>   "She had the most incredible attitude. She will turn any negative
into a positive and has such killer instinct. And her sexuality is so
refreshing in a sport with so many little girls."</TE>
<TE>   Witt demurred when asked where she belongs among the sport's
greats, saying every era has its idols.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting if you talk to people, what has stuck in
people's minds," she said. "For me, of course, it is a compliment
when people remember my performances and they remember 'Carmen' and
'Where Have All the Flowers Gone?' [from the 1994 Lillehammer Games,
where she finished seventh]. It is very rare that you go to someone
and you say, 'What did they skate to?' or 'What story did they bring
to you?' and they know. I think that's what makes me very proud."'</TE>
<TE>   Kristi Yamaguchi won her only U.S. championship in 1992 before
winning gold at Albertville. A two-time world champion, Yamaguchi was
strong technically but remote emotionally; she left for the pro ranks
after the Games. Her successor, Oksana Baiul of Ukraine, won the 1993
world title in her second international competition. She followed
that by edging Nancy Kerrigan for gold at Lillehammer and turning
pro. Lipinski, the youngest individual Winter Olympic gold medalist
at 15 years 225 days, also switched tracks to professional shows
after her upset of Kwan at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Kwan has competed 10 times at the U.S. senior
championships and eight times at the World Championships. She has not
finished lower than third at a major international event since the
1995 World Championships, where she was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Sustained excellence elevates Kwan to a lofty perch, in Witt's
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been dominating her sport the last couple of years, and
she always has been someone who, athletically, is trying very hard
and did great jumps," Witt said. "And at the same time, she is a
beautiful and elegant skater out there. And especially within the
last decade, there hasn't been a skater who stayed for such a long
time and has been successful a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hamilton, the 1984 men's gold medalist, measures Kwan's
success by the number of skaters who imitate her. One example is the
Charlotte, in which she glides backward on one leg while leaning
forward and grabbing her ankle, with her other leg pointing high
behind her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like she's the first one to do it, but because she's
winning and so exceptional, other skaters copy her," Hamilton said.
"It shows she's not only well-liked for being a champion, but skaters
like the way she skates."</TE>
<TE>   That factors into his certainly she will realize her dream of
skating immortality no matter the outcome at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Janet Lynn told me something very early in my career," Hamilton
said. "She told me, 'Whatever you do can never be taken away from you
regardless. Everything you accomplish is added to what you've already
done.'</TE>
<TE>   "That being said, look at Michelle, who has won six U.S. titles,
and I don't know how many people have done that. Just in that regard,
in modern-day skating, which is a whole different animal, that you've
had the ability to win that many titles when it's so much easier for
teenagers to jump, that says a great deal about her competitive
nature and her ability to put it together when the pressure's on....</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at how beautifully she skates. I always was one of
those who never wanted to be the first to do something or have
anything named after me, but I wanted to do it in such a way that it
was unique and I stood on my own. I think Michelle has done that."</TE>

<LD>The last two times the Winter Olympics were held in America, the
United States won the gold medal. With potent playmakers such as Mike
Modano and a resurgent Keith Tkachuk, this year's team is much less
an underdog and another victory wouldn't be such a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   It's impossible to talk about hockey without mentioning Canada.
And it's almost as difficult to comprehend how the Canadians haven't
won gold since 1952. They're loaded with talent, but with such stars
as Eric Lindros and Mario Lemieux slowed by injuries and goalie
Patrick Roy deciding to sit these games out, they're susceptible.</LD>
<LD>   Goalie Dominik Hasek is back with the Czech Republic team, which
automatically gives them a chance to defend their gold medal. Having
Jaromir Jagr around also won't hurt. The Tampa Bay Lightning's
Nikolai Khabibulin has been one of the best players in the NHL, and
he'll man the nets for Russia.</LD>
<TE>   The absence of Saku Koivu and Peter Forsberg will hurt Finland and
Sweden, respectively, but they still have Teemu Selanne and Mats
Sundin.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics' larger ice surface tends to benefit the European
players and their finesse game.</TE>

<LD>   The promos will say prime-time broadcasts will begin at 8 p.m. in
the Eastern time zone and 7:30 in the Pacific time zone. But there no
doubt will be some confusion, even with graphic reminders that the
telecasts are delayed here. The odd starting time of 7:30 won't help
matters either.</LD>
<LD>   Dick Ebersol, NBC Sports chairman, wanted live telecasts
throughout the country. "This was one battle I lost," he says.</LD>
<TE>   The West Coast stations, among them NBC-owned Channel 4 in Los
Angeles, wanted the later starting time, and the network gave them
what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Falco, NBC president, said, "If you ask somebody if they'd
rather have an event live or on tape, their answer is, of course,
they'd rather have it live.</TE>
<TE>   "If you explain to them that having it live on the West Coast it
may be on at 5 o'clock, which means they won't be able to watch it,
they go, 'Oh, then I'd rather have it on tape.'</TE>
<TE>   "So our local affiliates, along with myself, believe we are
servicing our viewers better when we put it on at a time when they're
available to view it."</TE>
<TE>   Paula Madison, general manager at Channel 4, says that viewership
is 18% greater between 8-11 p.m. than it is between 5-8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The station and its parent company want as many eyeballs watching
the Olympics as they can get. More eyeballs mean more money from
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which is hoping for a nightly audience of 59 million viewers,
reportedly has told advertisers it is counting on an average rating
of about 17.8 for its prime-time coverage. That's a pretty hefty
goal. CBS averaged a 16.3 for the 1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that could help drive the ratings up is less prime-time
coverage. NBC had five hours of prime-time coverage a night from the
Summer Olympics at Atlanta and Sydney, Australia, running from 7 p.m.
to midnight, but will have only 31/2 hours of prime-time coverage a
night from Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   It will run from 7:30-11 p.m. on the West Coast on most nights and
8-11:30 in the East. There are a few nights in which prime-time
coverage will begin at 8 in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Because there will also be coverage on CNBC and MSNBC and because
of a considerable amount of repeat programming, there will be a total
of 3751/2 hours of coverage during the 17 days of the Games, three
times more than from Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 3751/2 hours, 207 will be on cable and 1681/2 on NBC.
Repeated programming includes overnight replays of the prime-time
shows.</TE>
<TE>   CBS had 129 hours of coverage from Nagano, 110 from Lillehammer,
Norway, in 1994 and 107 from Albertville, France, in '92.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC, available in 74 million homes, will cover such sports as
curling, biathlon, cross-country skiing and hockey.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC, available in 83 million homes, will provide nearly
wall-to-wall hockey coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "For hockey fans, it's a dream come true," said Molly Solomon,
coordinating producer of NBC's cable coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lampley, working his 11th Olympics, will serve as host of all
the weekday cable coverage. He'll be on 11 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local Coverage</TE>
<TE>   Channel 4 will supplement the network coverage with plenty of its
own.</TE>
<TE>   The station will kick things off Friday at 6:30 p.m. with an
hour-long special, "Fred Roggin's Road to Salt Lake City." The
program will feature 13 Olympic athletes, 11 from Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Following the Roggin special will be NBC's coverage of the opening
ceremony, which will be repeated at 1:39 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Prime-time coverage will be repeated throughout the Games,
following a 35-minute local news break and the network's late-night
Olympic coverage.</TE>
<TE>   That means no Jay Leno or Conan O'Brien during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Channel 4, which is sending eight anchors and reporters to
Salt Lake City, will have its own show, "Channel 4 News: Olympic
Edition" nightly from 7-7:30 beginning Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   This show will be anchored by Chuck Henry and Michele Ruiz. Pat
O'Brien will serve as a special correspondent, contributing one
segment each night.</TE>
<TE>   The 4 and 6 p.m. newscasts will originate from Salt Lake City, and
the morning, midday, 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts will include
reports from there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Features</TE>
<TE>   As for NBC's coverage, Ebersol says there will still be an
emphasis on storytelling, but there will be less time for feature
profiles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots of live sport to cover and most nights we're on the
air in prime time for 31/2 hours, as opposed to five hours per night
from Sydney and Atlanta," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "So with fewer hours, we'll have fewer features and will rely more
on our announcers to carry the load of storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   "More than half the profiles will be on foreign athletes, which
was the case in Sydney."</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol stressed that NBC will not go out of its way to
manufacture or inflame patriotic moments.</TE>
<TE>   "We will cover the stories that occur naturally and honestly," he
said. "These Games do have the potential to serve as a healing event
in particularly troubling times."</TE>
<TE>   He called security at Salt Lake City "tight but polite."</TE>
<TE>   "It still feels strange to go the men's room and see Army men with
16-millimeter rifles hanging at their sides," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol said a piece on security will air just before the opening
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   As for breaking news, Ebersol said, "There is no question, if it's
real news, we step aside. News correspondents Sara James, Bob Hagar
and Kelly O'Donnell will be part of our team."</TE>
<TE>   Hagar will do the piece on security.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Innovations</TE>
<TE>   Most of the innovations seen during the Games will be in the area
of graphics.</TE>
<TE>   Ski jumping will feature "first-and-10" type technology so the
viewer knows how far a jumper must go to take the lead, although
there are points awarded for style too.</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating will feature continuous mph readings, and there will
be lane identification flags, as seen during the swimming competition
at Sydney, to show the nation of each skater.</TE>
<TE>   The bobsled, luge and skeleton coverage will be augmented by eight
"speed traps," which will offer continuous speed readings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Talent</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas will be working his fifth Olympics for NBC and fourth
as the prime-time host.</TE>
<TE>   The big news is that he'll be joined by Jim McKay, on loan from
ABC.</TE>
<TE>   McKay, 80, entertained reporters during a news conference that was
televised to NBC stations last week.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what his role will be at Salt Lake City, he said:</TE>
<TE>   "Well, remember Ross Perot's running mate [James B. Stockdale]? He
said, 'Who am I and why am I here?' With the tone he used, it didn't
come out right and the press had a lot of fun with that.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's sort of the way I feel."</TE>
<TE>   McKay said he wasn't sure what his role would be "until we start
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ebersol, who broke into the business as an Olympic researcher
when McKay was the host at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City,
"We are absolutely thrilled to have Jim, and we owe a big debt of
gratitude to ABC and [ABC Sports President] Howard Katz for letting
Jim join us."</TE>

<DH>American Flag Will Wave at Salt Lake, Where History Has a
Chance to Repeat</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do not adjust your television set. Do not dial your cable operator
and demand to know what happened to the greens and the yellows and
the oranges and the many other hues you distinctly remember paying
for.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Winter Olympics, brought to you by NBC from Salt Lake
City, will be triple-cast in red, white and blue. And after that,
just to mix things up, there will be redder reds, brighter whites and
truer blues.</LD>
<LD>   Now that New England has completed its stopover at Super Bowl
XXXVI, make way for the Patriot Games. It will be wall-to-wall stars
and stripes, American flags around the clock, Old Glory everywhere.
For 16 days and 375 1/2 hours of television coverage, the
Star-Spangled Banner will be No. 1 on the charts.</LD>
<TE>   Part of this is as predictable as NBC, the ironically nicknamed
"peacock network," which treats every Olympics it covers as if it
were the All-American Bowl: Yankees, this is your home; everybody
else, sorry, wrong colors.</TE>
<TE>   Part of this is thanks to the ever-expanding Winter Olympics menu,
which since 1994 has added such American-friendly events as
snowboarding, skeleton, women's hockey and women's bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   That means more American medalists--the U.S. Olympic Committee has
set a goal of 20 medals, seven more than the U.S. Winter Olympic
record--and that means more smiling Americans and more renditions of
the national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   And part of this comes down to the particulars of time and place.</TE>
<TE>   This will be an American Olympics, possibly the last for the
foreseeable future, five months removed from the greatest tragedy in
U.S. history. The United States is at war in Afghanistan, scorched
rubble is all that remains of the World Trade Center and a country
still shaken from the horrific events of Sept. 11 must rise to the
occasion of welcoming the world to the planet's biggest winter
sporting spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Eruzione, captain of the 1980 gold-medal-winning U.S. hockey
team, remembers the wave of patriotism that swept through the country
after that improbable victory, which also happened on home soil, in
Lake Placid. He sees the same kind of sentiment cresting around the
opening ceremony in Salt Lake because of current events and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Olympic Games back in this country, it's a great
opportunity for us as a country to show the world that, first of all,
we will never forget Sept. 11--and we should never forget that,"
Eruzione says.</TE>
<TE>   "But we can also show the world that we will survive and we will
move on and we will, as President Bush said, persevere."</TE>
<TE>   Bud Greenspan, longtime Olympic documentarian, sees similarities
between the national mood coming out of Lake Placid in 1980 and that
readying for Salt Lake City 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there when America got patriotic for the first time in
years after the Russian-American hockey game," Greenspan says,
referring to the U.S. upset of the heavily favored Soviets in a 1980
semifinal. "When we got out of the game, it was about 7 o'clock in
the evening and the snow was coming down and people were walking up
and down Main Street and hugging and kissing each other. And then we
heard a strong baritone voice singing 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' And
everybody stopped and began to sing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at that moment that Vietnam was forgotten and America fell
terribly, terribly in love with its own country....</TE>
<TE>   "This time, it has been 'U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!' since Sept. 11. I
think you're going to find a lot of emotional things happening every
time an American does something in Salt Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These will be the fourth Winter Olympics held in the United
States. More than simple ski-skate-and-hockey competitions, each has
served as a tap into our collective psyche during good times and bad,
during wartime and peace, during economic troubles and boom periods.</TE>
<TE>   The first U.S. Winter Olympic Games were held in 1932 in Lake
Placid during the depths of the world-wide Depression. They were
shoestring Games, attended by only 17 countries, down from 25 at the
St. Moritz Games of 1928, with land for the bobsled run donated by
the president of the organizing committee, Dr. Godfrey Dewey.</TE>
<TE>   Scraping out a living, doing whatever it takes to get by--these
were staples of everyday American life. The lofty "Olympic ideal" was
not above such hard-scrabble reality. With the Games on their own
turf, the hosts imposed a different set of rules on the speedskating
competition, replacing the traditional international format of two
skaters on the ice skating against the clock with heats of five or
six skaters. The switch outraged the Europeans, causing five-time
Olympic champion Clas Thunberg of Finland to pull out of the event.</TE>
<TE>   After a few shoulders had been shrugged, the Americans began
rubbing their hands together. Under the so-called "North American
rules," North American skaters claimed 10 of the 12 speedskating
medals.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight years later, the Winter Olympics returned to the
United States, to the tiny California ski resort of Squaw Valley. It
was February 1960 in America. The Eisenhower administration was in
its final months, the economy was prospering and despite the
attendant Cold War anxiety of the day, the nation was feeling good
about itself.</TE>
<TE>   In affluent times, skiing had become a popular diversion.
Heralding a women's Alpine competition that would produce three U.S.
silver medals, Sports Illustrated ran a drawing of Olympian Betsy
Snite on its Feb. 1 cover, along with a headline announcing, "U.S.
Girl Skiers On Top Of The World." Inside, the accompanying story
carried another headline: "Young, Cute, Deadly."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to the Games, Sports Illustrated also ran
stories on Dorothea Walker, the first woman social director to
oversee protocol at an Olympic Games, and the "sumptuous buffet"
being prepared at a Lake Tahoe lodge for visiting Olympic
dignitaries--15-pound sirloin roast, greened spaghetti, apricot
mousse for dessert. There was a fascination with wealth. Hedonism was
in, with silliness riding in the sidecar.</TE>
<TE>   Squaw Valley organizers turned the opening and closing ceremonies
over to "pageantry chairman" Walt Disney, who proceeded to decorate
the village with "snow sculptures" made of plaster, promising
officials that they would look just like actual snow, even though
Squaw Valley was well-equipped with the real stuff.</TE>
<TE>   This did not sit well with all visitors. Olympic Chancellor Otto
Mayer feared the elaborate entertainment plans, which included the
likes of Art Linkletter and Danny Kaye performing nightly for the
athletes, would turn Squaw Valley into "a second Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Hollywood-ization of the Games and an overdose of
American cheese, U.S. athletes managed to win only three gold medals
and 10 altogether at Squaw Valley. Ice hockey yielded one of the
golds, creating what is now a familiar blueprint: Underdog Americans
surprisingly climb their way into the semifinals, where they upset
the defending champion Soviets and then ward off post-shocker letdown
and one final opponent to clinch the title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1980 U.S. hockey team simply followed 20-year-old skate marks.
Yet, the 1980 victory is lauded as a "Miracle On Ice," one of the
great moments in Olympic history, and the 1960 triumph is remembered
as a pleasant sidebar, if it is remembered at all,</TE>
<TE>   "It was the exact same scenario as 1980," says Olympic historian
David Wallechinsky. "An American team of amateurs unexpectedly upset
the Soviet Union, and then, in the last game, came from behind and
won the gold medal. But there were two differences.</TE>
<TE>   "First, the mood of the country was different. In 1960, the
economy was booming. Americans didn't feel put-upon. Yes, there was
the Cold War, but it was just different. In 1980, the economy was bad
and the Soviets were taking advantage--that's the way it was
perceived.</TE>
<TE>   "So, it was the exact same format of victory, which was just a
nice little story in '60, but a national story in '80--the miracle.</TE>
<TE>   "The other difference between '60 and '80 was television. Nobody
saw those [victories] in 1960. But everybody watched in 1980."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Winter Games returned to the United States in
1980, Soviet troops had invaded Afghanistan and President Jimmy
Carter was discussing a boycott of that year's Moscow Summer
Olympics. Fifty-two Americans were being held hostage in Iran. The
U.S. economy was stalled, along with millions of cars lined up
outside gas stations across the nation, waiting to overpay at the
pump.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, a hockey game between the United States and the
Soviet Union at Lake Placid took on heightened "symbolic
significance," according to Wayne Wilson, head researcher for the
Amateur Athletic Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the '80 Games, there was the [ever-present] media issue of
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and feeling of helplessness on the
part of the United States as to how to deal with that," Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   Eruzione firing the puck past goaltender Vladimir Myshkin for a
4-3 U.S. victory didn't move the Soviet Union one step closer to
evacuation of Afghanistan; Carter went through with his threat to
boycott the Summer Olympics when the Soviets refused to remove their
troops. But, for a few giddy days in late February, it provided
Americans with a respite and a diversion, the right tonic for the
times.</TE>
<TE>   "We did something that very few people in their lives have a
chance to do," Eruzione says. "And that is two things: one, win a
gold medal in the Olympic Games, and two, not only have it as a great
moment for yourself and your team, but to have a country share in it.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many events where that happens. You know, the
Arizona Diamondbacks win the World Series--well, I'm a Red Sox fan, I
don't really care. The Lakers might win a world championship, but I'm
a Celtics' fan.</TE>
<TE>   "But when it's the Olympic Games, it's a whole nation that watches
and it's a whole nation that feels a part of it. So when the U.S.
Olympic hockey team wins, or the Mary Lou Rettons or the Carl Lewises
or the Dan Jansens or the Bonnie Blairs ... the whole country feels
like it wins."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A similar scenario surrounds the Salt Lake City Games. Caution:
Emotional overload ahead, underscored by the likelihood that these
could be the last U.S. Olympics in a very long time. The
International Olympic Committee, shamed by the bribery scandal
unearthed after these Games had been given to Salt Lake City, is not
believed to be keen on rewarding the United States any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for Sept. 11, we'd all be writing stories about
the bribery scandal," Wallechinsky says. "In a way, Utah lucked out."</TE>
<TE>   Wallechinsky believes the IOC has been "wanting to spread the
Games around more, anyway" and is concerned about the possibility of
"in the middle of the Games, the United States starts bombing another
country, or there's an incident at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, if Salt Lake does a great job, and everything
runs smoothly, then that will be good for American prestige."</TE>
<TE>   John Lucas, an Olympic historian and lecturer at Penn State
University, has a simple wish for the 2002 Winter Olympics: that they
succeed in providing "a brief peaceful interlude between chaos to the
left and to the right, before, and possibly, after."</TE>
<TE>   Long before prime-time audience shares and USOC salary bonuses
tied to American medal counts, that was the intent.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In this space we'd like to begin coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics
with a message to all those stuffed sweaters fretting over the
possibility that, with the world dragging its sleds to our hills, we
will overwhelm the events and diminish the Olympic ideal with loud,
tacky shows of patriotism: Stick a star-spangled sock in it.</LD>
<LD>   If Americans can't cheer for their country now, then when?</LD>
<LD>   If Americans can't light up the room during the next two weeks
with a howl for a speedskater from small-town Wisconsin who lives in
a mobile home and works at Home Depot and listens to the Dixie Chicks
... then when?</LD>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, we've ascribed to every major sporting event the
power to heal.</TE>
<TE>   We've been wrong until now.</TE>
<TE>   The World Series was emotional, the Super Bowl was sentimental,
all those giant flags on all those college football fields were
inspiring. But since Sept. 11, we haven't seen anything like this.</TE>
<TE>   At every other event, the American flag is saluted before the
event.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two weeks in Salt Lake City, the American flag is the
event.</TE>
<TE>   We're not cheering for the Yankees, we're cheering for the
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   This is not about a team; this is about a territory.</TE>
<TE>   And to those who worry that our constant USA chants will frighten
the Scandinavian silver medalist, or insult the sleek French ski
team, or exclude those lovely Italian bobsledders: Pipe down.</TE>
<TE>   If others can't understand how badly this country can use a cheer,
then they are more short-sighted than they claim us to be.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from how much the rest of the world panicked when we were
attacked, other countries may want to hear us cheer.</TE>
<TE>   The strong United States means a stronger world. If that world
didn't know this before Sept. 11, it does now.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, yeah, the Olympics are about a world spirit and global unity
and all that.</TE>
<TE>   And, yeah, yeah, the proper way to watch an Olympic event is to
cheer evenly for everybody, only barely raising your voice if the
competitor is wearing your flag.</TE>
<TE>   But this year is different.</TE>
<TE>   This year, these grand ideals have stumbled into a neighborhood at
war. This year, the host country is feeling less like a world
ambassador and more like a band of brothers.</TE>
<TE>   And so for these upcoming 16 days, it's OK to let the howls out.</TE>
<TE>   Our downhill skiers are not New York City or Pentagon rescue
workers, but cheer for the freedom they symbolize.</TE>
<TE>   Our figure skaters won't win the war, but cheer the sort of
enduring strength that will.</TE>
<TE>   This is, after all, what every other host country in the world
does during these events.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, the streets were filled
with the chants, "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone though it was cute and endearing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when we chant "USA" everyone thinks we're arrogant? Including
ourselves?</TE>
<TE>   It's strange how we Americans are so quick to embrace another
country's patriotism, yet so careful about our own.</TE>
<TE>   Well, for the rest of the month, stop being so careful.</TE>
<TE>   Scream at the television for Brian Shimer. Convince your family to
do a living-room wave for Derek Parra. Brag during lunch about Todd
Lodwick.</TE>
<TE>   You've never heard of any of these people? Good.</TE>
<TE>   There's never been a better time to cheer for complete strangers
based on the sole fact that we are from the same country.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that the definition of patriotism?</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stuffed snowsuits are already worried that we'll
overdo the national pride right from the opening ceremony, warning
that we should not allow an American hero to carry the Olympic torch
for that final stretch up the steps to the Olympic caldron.</TE>
<TE>   That role should be played by a world hero, they say. That job
should be given without national partisanship, they cry.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, shush.</TE>
<TE>   If that person is not somebody who has helped our nation cope with
Sept. 11--a rescue worker or an official--then it is a waste of
steps.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, in Sydney two years ago, the entire final relay leg was
composed of Australian heroes who, at the time, were important to
their country for more than sports. Or have we already forgotten the
Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman?</TE>
<TE>   They can do it, but we can't?</TE>
<TE>   So root, root, root for the home team. Respect others, but not so
much that you are afraid to get rowdy for your own.</TE>
<TE>   You can't be too red. Or too white. Or too blue.</TE>
<TE>   For these 16 days in February, there can be no ugly Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Only Americans.</TE>

<HD>A Grain of Salt</HD>
<DH>The Homogenized Version of the Olympic City Should Be Taken
With....</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN SCHULIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you could ignore the grime on the collar of his ruffled shirt,
Pappy Jack's middleweight dressed like Sugar Ray Robinson, which
wasn't something you saw every day in the Salt Lake City I remember.
It was even whiter than it is now, and Pappy Jack's middleweight
enhanced his exotic image with long cars and a missing thumb, the one
he lost in a prison brawl.</LD>
<LD>   There had been a time when a shot at Sugar Ray, and a world
championship, was practically his--all he had to do was go for the
price down in Texas. But that turned out to be a lie, and the fight
he threw turned his career into one too. So he went back to Salt Lake
and did what he figured he had to do, until the cops knocked on Pappy
Jack's door at midnight.</LD>
<LD>   Someone had cleaned out an appliance store, and the cops knew it
was the middleweight Pappy Jack managed. They went to him first
because he had the city's underbelly wired when most of its Jell-O
eaters didn't even know it had one. Ran a poker game in the rear of a
bar, did favors for politicians who craved plausible deniability, and
never turned down a hard-luck case who showed up with his hand out.</LD>
<TE>   The cops paid homage to Pappy Jack's connections by saying they
would give his middleweight a break: Return the swag and nobody goes
to jail. A couple of nights later, Pappy Jack's garage was full of TV
sets and toaster ovens, and by morning they were back where they
belonged. The middleweight didn't come around much after that.</TE>
<TE>   Pappy Jack's son told me the story in junior high, and I count it
as my introduction to the Salt Lake City you'll never hear about
during the Winter Olympics. Everything will glow with milk-fed
purity, just the way the Mormon church and the Chamber of Commerce
would have you think it always does. But 40-odd years ago, it was a
lot more fun than that, and crazier, and sometimes meaner.</TE>
<TE>   There were always young bucks going off to cowboy in Wyoming, and
old coots playing billiards in T-shirts that didn't quite cover the
vast expanse of their stomachs. On the desert west of Salt Lake, you
could watch dog fights in the dead of night. Some guys looked for
drunken Ute Indians to fight at Johnny Cash concerts, probably
because it was safer than taking on the Boone brothers when they were
out of jail. The rest of us simply tried to stay in one piece every
time a baseball umpire nicknamed "Nuts" insulted a stranger's wife
and started another donnybrook at the Indigo Lounge.</TE>
<TE>   But all anybody wants to know upon learning that I grew up in Salt
Lake is whether I'm Mormon. I tell them I couldn't pass the physical.</TE>
<TE>   That's a joke. The truth is, I was Lutheran when I moved there
from Los Angeles with my parents at 13 and a Lutheran skeptic
regarding organized religion when I left for grad school at
Northwestern nine years later. The church--no need to ask which
church in Salt Lake--affected my life only by making the lunatic
fringe that much more appealing. I investigated the fringe with an
ecumenical group, Catholics, Presbyterians and one Greek Orthodox
Serb. There was also a future Mormon bishop who one night consumed
enough 3.2 beer to float him to the stage where he danced with Leroy
&amp; the Upsetters at a dive out by the airport. The boy had some moves.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it wasn't that many years later that I vexed him by
describing Salt Lake in print as a theocracy. His wife, a bishop's
daughter, salvaged our friendship by pointing out that a theocracy is
exactly what Salt Lake is.</TE>
<TE>   The next time I upset a native's delicate sensibility, religion
had nothing to do with it. I walked into a downtown bar the night
before the 1979 NCAA championship basketball game, and from the
darkness at a corner table, I heard an ominous voice say, "I saw what
you wrote in the paper. You weren't very funny." It was G. Brown,
a.k.a. Honey Bear, a wide load whose junior-high exploits as a
candy-bar extortionist I had lovingly recounted. His motto: "A Big
Hunk a day keeps G. Brown away."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for me, G. was in the mood for drinking, not pummeling
old acquaintances, and by night's end, we were working our way
through the nicknames everybody seemed to have acquired in an attempt
to be colorful: Bulldog, Featherhead, Moving Van, the Midnight
Indian. There was even a 5-foot-3 Italian hard-nose who was known to
at least one bar owner as the Tall Swede. And the Tall Swede, in
turn, made me an honorary paisan by tacking an o on the end of my
name and calling me Schuliano.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the guys who wore nicknames, the one who stands tallest in
my memory is Sheik Caputo, the son of a west side bootlegger, who
swore he spent Prohibition stomping on grapes in the family bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   "People thought I was wearing purple socks for years," Sheik said.</TE>
<TE>   He was a Union Pacific machinist and a semipro first baseman who
became my neighbor, my American Legion baseball coach and my friend.
He fed me my first slice of pepperoni, gave me my first chew of
tobacco, and took me to my first go-go bar. His buddies from the
railroad said one of the dancers was dying to meet him. Why he wanted
me along, I couldn't understand--I was underage and shyer than
most--but there I was when the go-go girl descended from her cage and
sashayed toward us. The next thing I knew, Sheik was leaning toward
me and whispering, "Jeez, she oughta come around and scare my kids at
Halloween."</TE>
<TE>   Sheik's buddies, in full matchmaking mode, suggested that he buy
her a drink.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," he told them as he pulled me out of my chair. "Got to get
my catcher home. Big game tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   But don't let that misadventure give you the wrong impression of
Salt Lake City's women. It's bad enough that Mark Twain, no fan of
Mormons, wrote about them so unkindly. In my experience, they could
be almost sinfully pretty, particularly when they had summer tans to
set off their blond hair and blue eyes. And yet the girl I think
about most as the Winter Olympics descend on Salt Lake is one who
didn't fit the stereotype, a willowy brunet who was a couple of years
behind me in high school and did most of her communicating with her
eyes and a mysterious smile.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of mine's kid brother, obviously as taken with this girl
as I was, bumped into her in a hotel bar some years ago, and before
the night was done, he had confessed that he'd always had a crush on
her.</TE>
<TE>   She looked at him evenly--no smile, no mystery--and said, "Your
crush would cost you a lot of money now."</TE>

<DH>With Future on Thin Ice, Ohno Recovered to Become Top
Short-Track Skater</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apolo Anton Ohno was on his way to jail when it occurred to him that
life might be more pleasant as an Olympic athlete. So he reexamined
his priorities and set out to become one.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so he was only 15 at the time, was already a budding star in
his sport, short-track speedskating, and had never been arrested. But
he had just suffered a major disappointment and, by his own
admission, "had a lot of friends that were gangbangers in [hometown]
Seattle."</LD>
<LD>   Ohno's parents were divorced before he was a year old and his hair
stylist father, Yuki Ohno, spent long days at his shop.</LD>
<TE>   "I was a latch-key kid from when I was 7 years old," Apolo
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he hit his teens, he had developed a lifestyle that
was pulling him toward real trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly I was just hanging out with the wrong crowd," he said.
"Always, when I was younger, I hung out with older people. I was
taken to a lot of house parties, clubs, that kind of thing.... There
was times when I would just go to a friend's house and wouldn't come
home until, like, three days later.</TE>
<TE>   "It was that kind of lifestyle that I think would have led to
something a lot more severe. There were definitely paths in my life
that, if I took them, I wouldn't be here [as an Olympian] today."</TE>
<TE>   So how did it come about that, in a few days, the young man who
says his first name, of Greek derivation, means "to lead away from,"
as in temptation, stands to become one of the brightest lights of the
Salt Lake City Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   It goes back to a decision he made, sitting on a rock in the
pouring-down rain, massaging a blister on his foot, in a remote
seaside area about two hours north of Seattle. Ohno, star of the U.S.
junior short-track team, had just missed qualifying for the '98 Games
in Nagano and was at loose ends.</TE>
<TE>   "After I missed the team, I spent about a week in a cabin by
myself," he said. "There was no TV, no telephone. There's
nothing--just ocean, sand and trees. I spent a week of solitude
there, just thinking about that whole year, and what I could have
done, and if I really wanted to keep pursuing this.</TE>
<TE>   "I always liked short track, but I really didn't realize how much
I loved the sport until I was out in the cabin. Then it kind of came
to me.</TE>
<TE>   "It was raining the whole time I was there--every single day--but
I wanted to keep working out because I wanted to make the world team.
There was one day, it was my third workout of the day, and I was
running and it was just pouring. I had a hole in my shoe and I was
getting a huge blister.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so tired, just really tired of training. I stopped and sat
on a rock at the side of the road. I just sat there for a while and I
think I just realized that if I was really designed for speedskating,
I'm going to keep running.</TE>
<TE>   "I got up and kept running."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, he was very well-designed for speedskating, for he
stands today--all 5 feet 8 and 165 pounds of him--as short track's
ranking male star. At 18, he won the overall championship in last
season's World Cup competition and ranked first in each of the three
individual events.</TE>
<TE>   There are those predicting he will not only win those three
events--the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter races in the Games--but will
set records doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Accidents happen quickly and often, though, in short track and, as
someone once pointed out, ice is a slippery substance.</TE>
<TE>   "If I make a mistake, I slip a tenth of a second and I've lost the
race," Ohno said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he had to survive a bit of a slip to stay in the Games.
Tommy O'Hare, a teammate and a '98 Olympian, charged after Olympic
qualifying that Ohno and Rusty Smith had conspired to fix the final
race at the trials so that their friend, Shani Davis, would make the
team, at O'Hare's expense.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno and Smith both denied wrongdoing but could have been
dismissed from the team had the charge stuck. During an arbitration
hearing in late January, however, it was determined that there was
insufficient evidence to support O'Hare's charge and he withdrew it.</TE>

<LD>   500: Apolo Ohno and the rest of the U.S. team have been skipping
most World Cup races this season, preferring to train in Salt Lake
City, so the standings are skewed. Still, the leader in the 500, Li
JiaJun of China, is a formidable foe for Ohno. So too are South
Koreans Kim Dong Sung and Min Ryoung, and Japan's Takafumi Nishitani.
Nishitani, in fact, is the defending Olympic champion, and Li and Kim
are both Olympic medalists. Canadian Francoise-Louis Tremblay and
Ohno's teammate and friend, Rusty Smith, also figure in the mix.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   1,000: South Koreans Kim, the defending Olympic champion, Min and
Lee Seung Jae lead the World Cup standings, but Ohno, his teammate
Dan Weinstein and Li will be strong contenders, as will Canadians
Marc Gagnon and Tremblay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,500: This race is new to the Olympics but not to the Olympians,
who have been skating it in World Cup competition. Ohno ranked first
in it last season--as he did in the two shorter races--and will be
favored. But round up the usual suspects--Li, Gagnon, Min, Lee and
Tremblay, then throw in Bruno Loscos of France.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Relay: The relay is traditionally the wildest of the wild when it
comes to short track and, truly, any good team can win it. But look
for the U.S., China, South Korea, Canada and Japan to battle it out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   500: If you predict that a Chinese skater named Yang--named Yang
Yang, actually--will win this race, you probably won't be far off.
The unsister Yangs pretty much rule, between them having won it three
of five times in World Cup competition this season. Yang A. Yang is
first in the standings and Yang S. Yang is second. Bulgarian Evgenia
Radanova, champion last season, is third.</TE>
<TE>   The Yangs make for one of short track's delightful little nuggets.
In Chinese, their names are spelled differently but sound the same.
To differentiate in English, initials were employed, an L for large
for the older of the two, an S for small for the younger. The older
didn't much care for the "large" designation, however, and changed
the L to an A. The younger didn't mind being "small" and kept the S.
Thus, Yang A. Yang--or Yang Yang (A) as it's sometimes seen--and Yang
S. Yang, or Yang Yang (S).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,000: Look for another Yang-Yang battle but throw in a South
Korean with a rhyming name, Sun Dandan, to keep them honest. Yang A.
and Yang S. rank 1-2 in World Cup standings in this event as well,
and Sun is third. Radanova, Park Hye Rim and Joo Min Jin of South
Korea, and American Amy Peterson figure to be among the contenders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,500: This is a new Olympic race for the women as well as the men
but they have been skating it in World Cup too, and guess who
dominates. The Yangs, A. and S., finished 1-2 last season and Yang A.
leads this season's standings. Radanova, Joo, Sun and Chikage Tanaka
of Japan will give them a run for their money.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Relay: China, thanks to the Yangs, South Korea, Canada, Bulgaria,
Japan, Italy and the U.S. all have shots in this scramble.</TE>

<DH>Hays, Who Paid for Practice Sled by Kick-Boxing, Is
Legitimate Medal Hopeful</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-thirds of Todd Hays' athletic career makes perfect sense.</LD>
<LD>   He grew up in Del Rio, Texas, a small Mexican border town so tough
he learned the martial arts in self-defense. And Texas being Texas,
he took up football.</LD>
<LD>   What seems to make no sense is his newest career as a bobsled
driver, snow being so rare in southwest Texas that Hays' school shut
down one day after a couple of inches fell.</LD>
<TE>   "We went out and played in it, like we were in the Alps," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of the Wasatch Mountains starting Feb. 16 in Park
City, Utah, Hays will attempt a feat that for United States men's
bobsled competitors has been akin to scaling Mt. Everest on stilts.
He is expected to help end a U.S. men's bobsled medal drought that
has lasted 46 years.</TE>
<TE>   It has come to this because Hays was just good enough in
kick-boxing and not quite good enough in football at what turned out
to be two crucial junctures in his athletic career.</TE>
<TE>   The first occurred in the summer of 1994 after Hays, a linebacker
at Tulsa who faced San Diego State's Marshall Faulk in the 1991
Freedom Bowl, was cut for the second time by the Toronto Argonauts of
the Canadian Football League.</TE>
<TE>   He was back in Del Rio, contemplating pursuing a football coaching
career, when his older brother Lee learned that a U.S. Bobsled
Federation recruiting program would be conducting a tryout in San
Antonio the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me I was going to try out," Hays said. "I laughed and
called him crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers would have to leave at 5 in the morning to make the
tryout, and Todd finally called his brother's bluff, telling Lee he'd
go if Lee actually got him up that early. Lee did, and the brothers
headed for San Antonio, borrowing an aunt's car because they weren't
sure they had one that was up to the 150-mile trip.</TE>
<TE>   Todd performed well enough in strength and speed tests and in a
subsequent tryout in Lake Placid, N.Y., to qualify for the U.S.
national team as a pusher. Wanting to keep his fate in his own hands,
he soon decided to become a driver, attending a driving school in
1995 at Lake Placid and showing a knack for piloting a bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'This is the future of the sport, this kid right
here,'" said three-time Olympic driver Randy Will, who taught Hays at
the school and coached him for the next couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   "He had incredibly good hands, very good eye-hand coordination and
a great feel for the ice. He' s a natural. He's a definite natural."</TE>
<TE>   Hays realized that to develop his talent he would need a decent
sled for practice. The problem was, the sled cost $10,000, about
$10,000 more than Hays had to spend on it.</TE>
<TE>   That's when kick-boxing kicked in. The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Hays
had fought in college and won a national championship in 1993, and in
1995 was invited to fight undefeated Japanese champion Koichiro
Kimura in Tokyo for, coincidentally, $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy money. The match was basically "anything goes,"
said Hays, who fought under the nickname "Hollywood," and the goal
basically was to choke one's opponent into submission.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly wasn't gung-ho to go over there, but I knew it was my
only opportunity," he said of getting enough money for a bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   Kimura's strategy was to get Hays down on the mat. That left the
Japanese fighter's neck exposed, however, and Hays won the match with
what he called a "guillotine choke."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Hays progressed steadily through the ranks of U.S.
drivers. He became good enough to get a bobsled federation sled and
made the 1998 Olympic team as an alternate.</TE>
<TE>   Further improvement got him state-of-the-art equipment as well as
a top crew of pushers. All of that paid off last March when Hays
broke a four-year U.S. men's gold-medal drought on the World Cup
circuit by winning the four-man race in Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   This season he has been the world's dominant driver and was
leading the World Cup two-man and four-man competition before pulling
off the circuit with two events remaining to get extra training time
on the Utah Olympic Park track.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the opportunity of 10 lifetimes," he said. "I just had to
make that decision to come back here and instead of being No. 1 in
the world, be No. 1 in the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Even a third-place finish in the two- or four-man event would give
the U.S. men their first Olympic bobsled medal since Arthur Tyler
drove his four-man crew to a bronze in the 1956 Games at Cortina
d'Ampezzo, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Hays' top competitors for gold will include Christoph Langen and
Andre Lange of Germany, Martin Annen and Christian Reich of
Switzerland and Pierre Lueders of Canada. Langen won gold in four-man
and bronze in two-man in 1998 at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the opposition nor the pressure figure to rattle the
fiercely competitive Hays, who said no bobsled trip could be as scary
as facing Kimura before a crowd of partisan fans. He said he is
trying to focus on the task at hand, rather than what is at stake in
the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Hays' focus was jolted late in January, however, when Pavle
Jovanovic of Toms River, N.J., one of his top pushers, was
disqualified from the Olympics for failing a drug test Dec. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Jovanovic denied knowingly taking any banned substance and has
appealed. His appeal will be heard by the International Court for
Arbitration in Sport on Wednesday in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   A United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation statement said
Jovanovic had inadvertently consumed a banned anabolic steroid
through a contaminated dietary supplement and should not be punished.</TE>
<TE>   Jovanovic and Garrett Hines were battling for the brakeman's spot
on Hays' two-man sled, so losing Jovanovic might not seriously hamper
Hays' medal chances. Jovanovic's loss would be felt more on the
four-man sled, where he was almost certain to be a significant
contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Will, though, believes Hays still can win a gold medal, in part
because his pushing ability contributes to the start Hays has said is
the key to ending the U.S. medal drought.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd is an incredible athlete, besides having those great hands,"
Will said. "I think Todd has what it takes, with or without Pavle."</TE>

<LD>   Two-Man: Todd Hays' hopes of winning the United States' first
Olympic bobsled medal in 46 years took a hit when push athlete Pavle
Jovanovic failed a late-December drug test and was disqualified from
the Games, pending an appeal. Garrett Hines was pushing Jovanovic for
a spot on the two-man sled, so Hays' medal chances aren't dead. The
gold-medal favorite is Christoph Langen of Germany, who won three of
the four World Cup races he entered. World Cup champion Martin Annen
of Switzerland, Christian Reich of Switzerland and 1998 gold medalist
Pierre Lueders of Canada are strong medal contenders.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Four-Man: Hays led the two-man and four-man World Cup standings
before pulling off the circuit early to train, but losing Jovanovic
probably would end his four-man gold-medal chances and open the door
for Germany's Andre Lange. Langen, the defending Olympic champion,
Annen and Switzerland's Christian Reich have a shot at a medal too.
Five-time Olympian Brian Shimer of the U.S. can drive with the best
of them but probably lacks a fast enough start to grab that elusive
medal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women: The United States' Jean Racine won the World Cup 2000 and
2001 titles but slumped this season and dumped brake person and
former best friend Jen Davidson for former NCAA heptathlon champion
Gea Johnson in December. Racine and Johnson broke the Utah Olympic
Park track record, but their lack of experience together and the
furor caused by the switch may hurt them, though they should still
win a medal. German drivers Susi Erdmann (an Olympic luge medalist)
and Sandra Prokoff have been models of consistency. Switzerland's
Francoise Burdet and the United States' Jill Bakken also are medal
threats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Luge</TE>
<TE>   Men's Singles: German legend Georg Hackl finished third in the
World Cup standings but won four of the seven races and should become
the first athlete to win four straight Winter Olympic gold medals in
the same individual event. World Cup and European champion Markus
Prock of Austria will challenge Hackl, who is using a new sled
Porsche engineers helped build. Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, the 1998
silver medalist, also is a medal favorite. Tony Benshoof, the top
U.S. hope, was seventh in the World Cup standings but a career-best
second in the finale Jan. 27 in Winterberg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Men's Doubles: The United States' two 1998 doubles medals were its
first Olympic medals in luge. Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin may
repeat their bronze-medal finish. Silver medalist Chris Thorpe
replaced the retired Gordy Sheer with former Canadian Olympian Clay
Ives, and although the pair struggled through most of the World Cup
season, they finished second in the circuit finale Jan. 26 in
Winterberg. The German teams of Patric Leitner and Alexander Resch,
and Steffen Skel and Steffen Woeller are strong medal contenders, as
are Austria's Tobias and Markus Schiegl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women's Singles: It's doubtful anyone will keep Germany from
filling all three spots on the medal podium. Defending Olympic
champion Silke Kraushaar and Sylke Otto dominated the World Cup
circuit, with '98 silver medalist Barbara Niedernhuber finishing
third. Austrian Angelika Neuner, third in the '98 Olympics, is the
best bet to prevent a German sweep. Becky Wilczak, a 21-year-old from
River Forest, Ill., finished fifth in the World Cup standings and may
place as high as fourth in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton</TE>
<TE>   Men: Gregor Stahli of Switzerland heads to Salt Lake as the clear
gold-medal favorite. Also strong is Martin Rettl of Austria.
America's top medal hopes are Chris Soule, second this year on the
World Cup tour, and Jim Shea Jr., heir to a U.S. Olympic legacy.
Shea's grandfather, Jack, won gold medals in speedskating at the 1932
Winter Games; his father, Jim, competed in three Nordic events at the
1964 Games. Jack Shea, 91, was killed in an automobile accident Jan.
22. Can the grandson channel his emotions at the Park City course, or
will he be overcome by the moment? Lincoln DeWitt of the United
States won a World Cup event last February.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women: The Salt Lake Games mark the first women's skeleton
competition in Olympic history; the men raced in St. Moritz,
Switzerland, in 1928 and 1948. Alex Coomber of Britain, the two-time
world champion, and Maya Pedersen of Switzerland figure to duel for
gold. Lea Ann Parsley of the U.S., who is working on her doctorate in
nursing from Ohio State, finished fourth in the final 2000 World Cup
standings, her first season on the tour, and sixth in the 2001
standings; she climbed back to fourth this year and could surprise in
Salt Lake.</TE>

<DH>Dunn, '98 Bronze Medalist, Works on New Flip She Hopes Will
Turn to Gold</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The halfpipe is a carved-out channel in the snow about the length of
a football field, with walls about 10 feet high. This is what you do
if you want to execute a maneuver called the Haaken flip:</LD>
<LD>   Think visually now, because you're going to be flying and
spinning. You start by approaching a wall in the halfpipe backward.
Then, at the lip of the halfpipe, you flip backward into the channel
and spin 720 degrees. That's two complete circles. You then land
forward down in the pipe.</LD>
<LD>   Got it?</LD>
<TE>   If Shannon Dunn gets it during the women's halfpipe event, odds
are very good she will get the gold medal--because, to her knowledge,
no other woman in the world has done it in competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I love doing tricks that no one has tried before," she says.
"That's what I thrive on."</TE>
<TE>   The maneuver is named after one of the kings of the halfpipe,
Norway's Terje Haakonsen--who doesn't compete in the Olympics,
considering them too corporate and thus bogus. Dunn loves the
Games--"I'm stoked I'm going to the Olympics," she says--and believes
that if she can master the Haaken flip in the next couple of weeks,
fans and judges "are going to freak." She adds, "They're going to be,
'How did she pull that one off?'"</TE>
<TE>   If it sounds farfetched to think that an Olympic-caliber athlete
can learn a new move in only a few days, consider this: Dunn learned
another exotic maneuver, called a McTwist, an inverted flip with a
540-degree rotation, just before the 1998 Nagano Games. She led the
competition after the first round and won a bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   The experience then will help her now, she says: "I know what to
expect--the anticipation of wanting to know what the Olympics are
like. I'm just going to take [Salt Lake] as another great
experience."</TE>
<TE>   At 29, Dunn is--at least on the snowboard tour--an old lady, so
old that she's known by some as "Shan-ma." As in grandma.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal always was to take really good care of my body so I could
stay at a high level for a long time," she says. "I'm really glad I
stuck with it. There have been some hard times when I felt like
quitting, when I felt I was getting too old for this. I knew if I
would have stopped, though, I would have had a lot of regrets. I just
pushed past it."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more unusual by snowboarding standards, Dunn is
married--her husband, Dave Downing, 33, is also an expert
snowboarder. They split their time between Lake Tahoe in the winters
and Encinitas, in northern San Diego County, in the summers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like the oldest ripping guy," Dunn says. "He's an
inspiration for a lot of people who have 9-to-5 jobs."</TE>
<TE>   So is Shannon. She was recently featured in one of the bibles of
the attitude and lifestyle scene, Transworld Snowboarding: "I'm all
about living in the moment," she told the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Thus will it be in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no choice except to be confident going into the Olympics,"
she says now. "You have to be in that mind frame. I have to just--I'm
putting all my eggs in one basket. That's what the Olympics is for:
going for it. Going for gold, doing the best you can, having a great
and awesome experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm mentally just going for it. I think that's more fun for me. I
don't want to be timid. I don't want to go, 'Oh, no, I don't know if
I can do it.' I'm going to say, 'I can do this.' Because that's what
the Olympics is all about."</TE>

<LD>   Halfpipe: Magnus Sterner of Sweden easily won last year's World
Cup title. But the U.S. team is extraordinarily solid. Tommy
Czeschin, sixth in last year's World Cup after blowing out a knee the
year before, is one of the few riders who can execute three full
spins in competition--that's called a clean 1080. Ross Powers won
bronze in Nagano. JJ Thomas won the recent X Games. And Danny Kass,
only 19, is already being acclaimed in halfpipe circles as the next
big thing.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Parallel Giant Slalom: One of the Games' most heartwarming stories
is American Chris Klug; he underwent a liver transplant in July 2000,
appears fully recovered and, on a course he loves in Park City, is a
solid threat to take gold. But Canadian Jasey Jay Anderson has shown
more consistency overall. And French teammates Nicholas Huet and
Mathieu Bozzetto finished 1-2 in last year's World Cup standings.
Also tough is Dejan Kosir of Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   Halfpipe: The competition is wide open. Can American Shannon Dunn
master a cutting-edge move in time for the Games? Stine Brun Kjeldaas
of Norway won silver at Nagano and at the 2001 world championship.
Nicola Pederzolli of Austria is the current World Cup points leader.
Sabine Wehr-Hasler of Germany and Yoko Miyake of Japan are also
eminently capable of taking a medal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parallel Giant Slalom: Karine Ruby of France is the one to beat.
She's the current World Cup points leader, No. 2 in last year's World
Cup, 1998 gold medalist. The top U.S. medal hope appears to be Rosey
Fletcher of Alaska, a 1998 Olympian. But it would be a great story
for all of the Advil-popping, channel-clicking weekend warriors in
their 30s and 40s should Idaho's Sondra Van Ert make the podium;
she's 38 years old and in her second career as a racer. She competed
for the U.S. ski team as an Alpine racer, quit in the mid-1980s, then
spotted some kids on a snowboard in 1990 and thought it would be fun.
In one of her high school yearbooks, classmates voted Van Ert "Most
likely to go to the Olympics."</TE>

Until He Was 25</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF EDITOR</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, Olympic speedskater Derek Parra, where in the Midwest did you
grow up? Where, when you were 5, did you open your Christmas skates,
then rush off to try them, skating till it was way past dark?
Waukesha, Wis.? White Bear Lake, Minn.? Northbrook, Ill.? What's
that, you say? San Bernardino? As in California? And you never had
ice skates as a kid? You had inline roller skates as a teenager,
which is getting to be longer ago than you care to remember?</LD>
<LD>   OK, let's see if we can get this all straight. You're about a
month shy of turning 32, you're 5 feet 4, from Southern California,
you took up speedskating when you were 25 and you think you can win
an Olympic medal. That about it?</LD>
<LD>   All true, you say, but the order is cockeyed? It's the Olympic
medal that's important and all the rest is, well, all the rest.</LD>
<TE>   "An Olympic medal, that's why I'm in speedskating," Parra says.
"It's the only reason.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd won 18 [gold medals] in inline skating. I'd set two world
records. I was overall world champion twice. I was leading medalist
in the Pan American Games in Argentina, and that's the second-biggest
event to the Olympic Games. When I started roller skating, we were
always told, 'It'll be in the Olympics. It'll be in the Olympics.' I
waited and waited but it never came."</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating was firmly ensconced in the Games, though, and other
inliners, notably Jennifer Rodriguez and KC Boutiette, had already
made the transition. They suggested Parra might want to follow in
their blade tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me a couple of years to transfer over but I finally did,"
he says. "I think I was on the ice for two weeks and I skated
nationals and was second in two distances, the 5K and the 10K. At
that point I said, 'Hey, I believe this is possible.'"</TE>
<TE>   Possible, but not easy. Parra's early success was followed by a
couple of seasons of learning how to skate on ice.</TE>
<TE>   "They may look the same, but [inline skating and speedskating] are
definitely different," Parra says. "I had to really forget everything
I learned in inline skating. I pretty much had to start from scratch.
I didn't excel as fast as I wanted to....</TE>
<TE>   "On inline skates, when your skate lands, you've got friction
immediately. You've got grip. On the ice, you've got a flat blade
that's only sharp on the edges. If you land on your flat, you'll
slide. If you land on your edge, you'll grip. You land on your inner
edge and you push off your inner edge.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, I was [landing flat] and pushing, like,
squeak, squeak, squeak. You could actually hear me all the way around
the oval in my sprints. It was embarrassing. But I had to learn to be
really patient and get all my power in one spot, where you're
supposed to push.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the beauty of speedskating, the fast push in the right
spot. You could see me really working, going as hard as I could, and
not getting anywhere. So I actually had to learn how to skate."</TE>
<TE>   But he did learn, and, in a sport that rewards athletes long of
leg and thick of thigh, he is deadly serious about that medal. Parra
will race the 1,500- and 5,000-meter races in the Games, the shorter
race offering him his best shot. He won a World Cup 1,500 at The
Hague in November and is second in the season standings.</TE>
<TE>   He might also have qualified for the 1,000 but, just before
Olympic trials, chose to fly from Salt Lake City to Orlando, Fla., to
be with his wife, Tiffany, for the birth of their first child, Mia
Elizabeth. Tiffany had been staying in Orlando with her mother while
Derek was doing his Olympic training. He got back in time to skate
the 1,000 but was exhausted from the travel, emotionally drained by
the birthing experience and unprepared for competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hoping to make it through," he said after the first of
the two qualifying races.</TE>
<TE>   Being unprepared for competition is hardly Parra's normal style.
Besides his daily skating workouts, he follows a rigorous four-hour
off-ice training routine that includes 32 drills, one of them a
series of jumps while wearing a 40-pound vest. Conditioning and
technique help make up for his slight stature--he weighs 140 pounds,
only slightly more than one of Eric Heiden's thighs during Heiden's
five-gold-medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980. Besides, Parra
says, size isn't everything.</TE>
<TE>   "The fastest guy in the world right now is a Japanese skater in
the 500-meter, [1998 Olympic winner] Hiroyasu Shimizu," he points
out. "He's 5-4. He's a little heavier than I am, but he's very fast
and has technical skills. He's OK because he can get off the line
quicker, with higher foot speed. But for the longer races, you've got
a longer recovery [between strides] and you can have a longer glide.</TE>
<TE>   "The recovery starts when your leg lifts off the ice and comes
around before it lands again. [Because of that] the taller skaters do
really well in the distances. If you're smaller, you have to be
technically perfect to go as fast as somebody who might not be so
technically perfect but is bigger and stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City will be Parra's second Olympic experience and he's
hoping it will be more rewarding than the first. Only two years into
speedskating, he made the U.S. team that went to Nagano and thought
he would be skating in the 5,000 as an alternate. Instead, he was
bumped. A classification error was discovered on Kazakhstan's entry
forms and when that skater was moved back into the 5,000, where he
belonged, there was no spot available for Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "My family had all come at the last minute, just two days before,
and now I wasn't even going to race," he says. "It was probably one
of the toughest moments of my career."</TE>
<TE>   This time around, Parra is a six-year veteran, is vastly more
familiar with the races he is skating, and has high hopes. If he
should win a gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   "For me, that would be one way to say thank you to everybody who's
ever believed in me, or who's ever helped me, kind of paved the way
for me to have success. Friends, family members. Holding up that
medal and being on that podium would be a great way of just saying,
'Guys, thanks for believing in me, and I love you.'"</TE>

<LD>Men</LD>
<LD>   500: If American Casey FitzRandolph is to win a medal, it figures
to be in this race. Canadian Jeremy Wotherspoon looms as the
favorite, on the strength of four World Cup victories this season,
but FitzRandolph, a veteran from Verona, Wis., ranks second to
Wotherspoon in the standings and has four second-place finishes to
his credit.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago at Nagano, FitzRandolph was third after the first
of two heats but got a starter's warning, then false-started in the
second and finished out of the medals.</LD>
<TE>   Among the contenders will be Gerard van Velde and Jan Bos of the
Netherlands, Michael Ireland of Canada and defending champion
Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,000: The 500 is his better event but FitzRandolph will race the
1,000 as well. Wotherspoon, Ireland and Bos all rank ahead of him in
the World Cup standings and no one would be surprised to see them
finish that way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,500: Derek Parra, at 31, gets his first shot at an Olympic medal
in this race. Parra, a former inline roller skater who grew up in San
Bernardino, switched to speedskating in 1995 and has cracked
speedskating's elite. He has won a World Cup race this season and is
second in the standings, behind Canadian Dustin Molicki. Defending
champion Aadne Sondral of Norway, his countryman, Petter Andersen,
and Erben Wennemars of the Netherlands figure as other strong
contenders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5,000: Parra is entered in this race as well but it pretty well
belongs to the long-striding Dutchmen--Gianni Romme, Bob de Jong and
Carl Verheijen. Parra, at 15th, is the highest ranking American in
the World Cup standings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   10,000: Dutch treat here too, with Romme, De Jong and Verheijen in
the world's most boring race. Romme is the defending Olympic champion
in both the long races.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   500: Catriona LeMay-Doan of Canada won this race in 1998 at Nagano
and probably will repeat here. She has been flawless in six World Cup
races this season and is well ahead of runner-up Sabine Volker of
Germany in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,000: The 1,000 is normally Chris Witty's best race, but the
American silver medalist of 1998 has been lagging this season--she
only recently learned she has mononucleosis, a strength-sapping
disease--and there is no telling how she will skate. Teammate
Jennifer Rodriguez, on the other hand, is having the season of her
life. The former inline roller skater from Miami, of all places, has
won a World Cup race at this distance and is second in the standings
to Germany's Volker. LeMay-Doan also poses a distinct threat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1,500: Rodriguez is the top American at this distance, but Anni
Friesinger of Germany and Cindy Klassen of Canada outrank her in the
World Cup standings. Claudia Pechstein of Germany and Maki Tabata of
Japan will be in strong contention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   3,000: Friesinger is the class here. She has won all five of the
World Cup events she has raced this year at 3,000 or 5,000 meters.
Pechstein looks like a good bet to reprise her Nagano silver-medal
performance. Tabata, Klassen and Renate Groenewold of the Netherlands
figure to be in the running for medals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5,000: Pechstein is the defending champion but Friesinger is the
new long-distance power.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's all very imperial. One dynasty succeeding another.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing democratic about international women's hockey. No
open voting, no equal access.</LD>
<LD>   It's been Canada and the United States. In that order. And that's
all.</LD>
<TE>   Canada has won the seven World Championships that have been played
since 1990. The United States won the inaugural Olympic women's
hockey tournament at Nagano in 1998. The Americans had to beat Canada
twice, once in the gold-medal game, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   In their most recent medal competition, Canada won the World
Championships last April at Minneapolis, beating Sweden, Russia and
Kazakhstan by a combined score of 29-1 before squeezing out a 3-2
victory over the U.S. The Americans beat Germany, China, Finland and
Russia by a combined score of 41-1. Kind of makes you want to hit the
snooze button through the preliminary rounds of the Olympics, doesn't
it?</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish team even contemplated staying home.</TE>
<TE>   "To go to the Olympic Games and just lose is no fun," Swedish
Olympic Committee President Stefan Lindeberg said in November.</TE>
<TE>   But they decided to come and take their punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Since absorbing that loss in the World Championships, the
Americans have been winning and winning and winning. Their series of
international exhibitions was dubbed the Skate to Salt Lake Tour. At
this rate, it looks as though the U.S. women will skate through Salt
Lake. They are 30-0 on the tour, eight of those victories over
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the big thing is that the Americans are playing with a
lot of passion--for obvious reasons," Canadian forward Cassie
Campbell said after their most recent loss to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said all along that I'm glad to be the underdog. We've been
the favorites for my whole career. We have nothing to lose. We aren't
even the defending champions going into Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   So is that to say the pressure is on the Americans?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we feel pressure," U.S. defenseman A.J. Mleczko
said. "We have a different team."</TE>
<TE>   Not entirely. Thirteen of the 1998 gold-medal winners are back.
But there's definitely a youth movement going on, what with the
addition of 16-year-old Lyndsay Wall.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has never lost to a country other than Canada.
It has been tied twice by Finland.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians are 35-0 in the World Championships and have only
the two losses to the United States in Nagano to blemish their record
in medal competition.</TE>
<TE>   Why such dominance by the two teams?</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, consider the head start.</TE>
<TE>   There are records of women's hockey games being played in Canada
as far back as 1892. (Although research showed the game featured
women playing against men dressed as women. Not only was this about
70 years before women's teams formed in Europe and Asia, it was more
than 100 years before Dennis Rodman thought of cross-dressing.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there's volume. There are more than 42,000 women and girls
participating in hockey in the United States, according to USA
Hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Contrast that to China. The world's most populous nation, with 1.3
billion people, has about 100 females playing hockey. But that won't
keep the Chinese from sending a team to compete in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Compete" being a relative word, of course.</TE>

<LD>The United States won the first Olympic competition in Nagano, and
this time the Americans will have their home fans to support them.
Cammi Granato earned the honor of carrying the American flag in the
1998 closing ceremony. Look for the de facto queen of American
women's hockey to carry the United States team in Salt Lake City. She
will have plenty of support from the likes of Kaite King, Krissy
Wendell and Jenny Potter. Goaltenders Sara DeCosta and Sarah Tueting
are both effective.</LD>
<LD>   Canada is the only other viable threat for the gold medal. The
Canadians are led by forward Hayley Wickenheiser, who is considered
the best women's hockey player in the world. But there's some
agitation north of the border because the Americans, who are more
adept at little aspects of the game, have surpassed the Canadians in
their national sport. Finland won the bronze in Nagano and has
finished third in the World Championships six times. Russia won the
"other countries' gold" last year at the World Championships.</LD>

<LD>Cross-Country</LD>
<LD>   Men: The balance of power might have shifted slightly to the east
of Norway, but cross-country skiing remains a particularly hot
Scandinavian specialty. At Lillehammer in 1994, people camped out--in
the snow, in sub-zero weather--so as not to get caught in traffic on
the way to the cross-country venue and risk missing their national
heroes, Bjorn Daehlie, Vegard Ulvang and Thomas Alsgaard, among
others.</LD>
<LD>   If people are camping out at Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain
State Park south of Park City, they'll probably be conversing in
Swedish, for Sweden's Per Elofsson looms as the skinny-ski star of
these Games.</LD>
<TE>   Elofsson, an up-and-comer four years ago at Nagano, has come all
the way up. He won last season's World Cup title handily--even though
he had raced in only half of the 20 events. He won six of the 10
races he entered and was second in another. No other athlete won more
than three races.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, some are saying Elofsson will win three gold
medals here, as many as five medals altogether, and that he may well
set records in three events.</TE>
<TE>   Observed Norwegian skier Frode Estil, "He's simply the best
cross-country athlete in both the short and long distances, and in
both techniques [the classical slide-and-glide and freestyle
skating]."</TE>
<TE>   There is some question, though, how Elofsson will tolerate the
thin air at Utah's high elevation. He blacked out during a 1997
junior race, and he has no experience at Soldier Hollow, having
skipped last season's World Cup race there.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters point out, however, that he is a tireless trainer and
will be in shape for whatever Soldier Hollow has in store. In fact,
they say, he skipped the race there last year so he could train for
the World Championships, where he won the pursuit and the 15k
classical.</TE>
<TE>   Ulvang and Daehlie have retired, but Alsgaard, winner of three
gold medals, is back for the Norwegians, in his third Olympics. He
finished third in last season's World Cup standings, right behind
Spain's Johann Muehlegg, a former German who won the 1999-2000 World
Cup title and is a projected medalist here.</TE>
<TE>   Also back is Italy's veteran star, Silvio Fauner, winner of five
Olympic medals and competing in the Games for the fourth time.</TE>
<TE>   America's chances? The usual answer, slim and none, has been
altered slightly, to slim and remote.</TE>
<TE>   There are no U.S. medals in sight, but that doesn't mean there has
been no progress. Two-time Olympian Justin Wadsworth, now 33, gave
the U.S. its best cross-country result since 1984 when he finished
eighth last season in a 30k World Cup freestyle race over this
season's Olympic course. Teammate Carl Swenson, a '94 Olympian who
took several seasons off while he raced mountain bikes, finished 16th
in a sprint at last season's Soldier Hollow World Cup race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women: Italian icon Stefania Belmondo, with seven medals one of
the most decorated of winter athletes, will be competing in the Games
for the fifth time--she made her Olympic debut at Calgary in
1988--and she may even find her way back to the podium. But youth
will be served, and Bente Skari of Norway appears poised to emerge as
the new Nordic queen.</TE>
<TE>   She won a bronze in the 5k classical at Nagano and a silver in the
women's relay, and since has won two World Cup titles, beating
Belmondo on a tiebreaker in 1999, then successfully defending her
title in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She was a close second last season to Russian Yulia Tchepalova, a
Nagano gold medalist.</TE>
<TE>   Skari, daughter of Odd Martinsen, an Olympian who won two medals
for Norway in 1968 at Grenoble, France, specializes in the classical
technique and is the favorite in the 10k classical.</TE>
<TE>   Daehlie has lately been coaching her in the freestyle technique,
however, and with improvement there, she also is projected as a
medalist in the new 1.5k sprint and the combined pursuit race, in
which a skier must use both styles.</TE>
<TE>   Tchepalova leads a strong Russian entry, with Olympic medalists
Larissa Lazutina and Olga Danilova figuring to add to their
collections. Lazutina finished third in last season's World Cup
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Katerina Neumannova, who won two medals for the Czech Republic at
Nagano, will be in the medal hunt again.</TE>
<TE>   Nina Kemppel, 31, saving some of her best for last, had her finest
season last winter for the U.S. team and will become the first
American woman cross-country skier to compete in four Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Skiing in the World Cup race at Soldier Hollow last winter, she
finished 14th in the pursuit, her best international finish, a few
weeks after finishing 16th in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   She was severely disappointed at Nagano, where, because of illness
resulting from overtraining, she finished 52nd in two races and
dropped out of two others. That bitter experience prompted her to
come back for one more Olympic appearance.</TE>

<DH>After Bad Memories of Nagano, Players Say They're Happy to
Be in Salt Lake</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Salt Lake City. If they can't make it there, they can't make it
anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   The Winter Games are in a friendly time zone with easy travel
arrangements, ideal conditions for the NHL to showcase its players in
Olympic competition.</LD>
<LD>   . Compare that to the first time the league took a midseason break
to send its players to the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, where travel
was grueling and the sport was often relegated to second-tier status.</LD>
<TE>   How the Salt Lake tournament fares, how many viewers watch and how
the players feel will all help determine whether the NHL continues
its Olympic involvement. So far, the league has committed to the
Games a little less than two years before they start.</TE>
<TE>   "We do one Olympics at a time," William Daly, NHL executive vice
president and chief legal officer, said. "It's ultimately a decision
for our board of governors, but we'll help kind of analyze the
objective data for them and help them kind of shape their thought
process as to whether it's a good thing or bad thing for us.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the whole premise is, there's no doubt, we're going to
get unparalleled exposure for the sport, exposure that it's never had
in this country before. That ultimately will benefit the sport as a
whole and professional hockey, and hopefully to the benefit of the
NHL. We've always taken the position that if you see the sport and
watch it, it'll sell itself."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 Games suffered from bad logistics and worse
circumstances. With Japan across the Pacific Ocean and the
International Date Line, 9 a.m. Wednesday in Nagano was 8 p.m.
Tuesday in New York. To make it worse, CBS showed much of the play at
midnight in the U.S. Then the U.S. team failed to make it to the
medal round. The ratings peaked at 4.9 for a weekend game between the
United States and Canada. But the gold-medal game between Russia and
the Czech Republic drew a 3.2.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, 30 of the 32 hockey games will be televised live.
Most will be on CNBC and some will be shown by MSNBC. Men's hockey
will air on NBC six times, including prime-time games on Friday, Feb.
15, and Wednesday, Feb. 20. The gold-medal game will be shown in the
11:30 a.m.-3 p.m. (Pacific time) block on Sunday, Feb. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City's proximity means less travel time and minimal jet
lag. Thus the midseason break was cut from 17 days to 12. Players
apparently have less problem with the Olympic break than they do with
the All-Star break, which many see as another interruption and time
commitment in a busy season. They would rather have that time to
rest. The league, of course, doesn't agree with that view.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to it as "part of the fabric of our season," Daly said,
"If we weren't having an All-Star game, we would not be taking a
break in our season. It's not like they'd get the four days off.
They'd be playing regular-season games."</TE>
<TE>   Time is a key issue to the players' union. For example, players
who make it to the gold-medal game will have played three games in
five days, then will resume their NHL seasons 48 hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Saskin, senior director of business affairs and licensing for
the NHL Players' Assn., said the union is generally in favor of
Olympic participation but will discuss the future among its
membership and with the league after the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, in any Olympics, a lot of the success is from a player
perspective if they feel the on-ice competition has been handled
well," Saskin said. "Given the events of Sept. 11, the security
elements of the Olympic games is going to have an increased effect on
how the player and fan experience is at Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   Said Darius Kasparaitis, a Pittsburgh Penguin defenseman and
member of the Russian Olympic team, "I think the NHL should be
involved in the Olympics. They should have more rest. Maybe they
shouldn't have the All-Star game that year. I think they should have
the Olympics. It's good stuff to go there and be a part of the other
athletes and sports. I think professional sports used to be more
isolated from other sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are still proud of going to the Olympics and still want to
win a gold medal. You win a gold medal, you're going to keep it the
rest of your life."</TE>

<LD>Women: The road to Salt Lake City had potholes for the top
contenders. Michelle Kwan struggled early this season, dropped Coach
Frank Carroll, and only gradually found equilibrium. She's the
favorite, but not overwhelmingly so. Her main rival, Russia's Irina
Slutskaya, fell twice in finishing second at the European
championships after shaky performances at the Grand Prix final and
Russian championships. Only Maria Butyrskaya of Russia won more than
one Grand Prix event, Nations Cup and Trophee Lalique. However,
Butyrskaya, 29, faltered at the European event and sometimes wilts
under pressure. U.S. teenagers Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes have the
goods but are Olympic rookies. If their nerves hold up, one could
grab a medal.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Men: The quad squad will rule. Alexei Yagudin and Evgeny Plushenko
of Russia, who have won the last four world titles, are capable of
spectacular quadruple-triple jump combinations. Yagudin might be the
better artist, but Plushenko has better technique. Tim Goebel of the
U.S. can jump with them but isn't as persuasive a performer.
Alexander Abt of Russia has an outside shot at a medal but would need
others to fall. So would six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, still
seeking that elusive great skate at 30 in his third Olympics.
Canada's Elvis Stojko, a two-time silver medalist who has been
plagued by leg injuries, could be a factor if he has two electrifying
performances left in him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dance: Jarred by accusations of collusion among judges at Nagano
in 1998, ice dancing remains the least respected of the four skating
disciplines. It's the most subjective and the least obvious: There
are no jumps or throws, as in pair skating, just a lot of strange
costumes, wild hair and overwrought performances. There's also little
or no movement in the standings from one phase of the competition to
the next.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's so subjectively judged and the subject of debate over
its athletic merits, ice dancing is in jeopardy of being dropped as
an Olympic sport, after having been added to the program only in
1976. For some, it would be no great loss.</TE>
<TE>   Skaters from the Soviet Union and/or Russia have won six of seven
Olympic gold medals, with only Britain's Jayne Torvill and
Christopher Dean breaking through with their stunning "Bolero"
routine at Sarajevo in 1984. However, there's no clear favorite at
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy won last year's
World Championships, but they were defeated at the European
Championships by Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France. The
French couple's free program, "Anthem to Liberty," is based on Martin
Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.</TE>
<TE>   Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada won Skate America and
Skate Canada and were second to Anissina and Peizerat at Trophee
Lalique. But the Canadians avenged that at the Grand Prix Final,
triumphing with their energetic if bizarre Michael Jackson free dance
medley. Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia are the only
other couple with a real medal chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pairs: Can "Love Story" conquer all--even a 38-year Soviet/Russian
stranglehold on Olympic pairs gold?</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada won their first world
title last year after skating to "Love Story" and living it as a
couple off the ice. They exude playfulness, romance and charisma as
called for, but they're prone to botching jumps and disrupting the
flow of their programs. They also switched coaches this season,
leaving the Montreal area and Richard Gauthier to move to Edmonton
and work with Sale's former singles coach, Jan Ullmark.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier won Skate America, Skate Canada and the Grand
Prix Final but were sloppy in winning the Canadian national
championship. They were also debating whether to revive "Love Story"
or stick with this season's long program, "The Orchid," a conceptual
piece.</TE>
<TE>   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia, silver
medalists at Nagano in 1998, should be the Canadians' toughest
challengers. However, a leg injury to Berezhnaya kept them out of the
European championships. Three-time world medalists Xue Shen and
Hongbo Zhao of China, who do some excellent throws, are also
contenders. Two other Russian couples also have the panache to win
medals: Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin, who were second at the
Russian championships, and Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov, who
were fourth at last year's World Championships.</TE>

<LD>The perpetual clash between athleticism and artistry in women's
figure skating will be played out again at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Will Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel make history--and the first
major technical leap by women in nearly a decade--by landing a
quadruple jump in her long program?</LD>
<LD>   Or will the interpretive skills of 1998 silver medalist Michelle
Kwan of the U.S. and Russia's Irina Slutskaya count more heavily in
deciding who wins the gold medal?</LD>
<TE>   A decade ago, the jumping possibilities seemed so unlimited for
female figure skaters, coaches and officials frequently expressed
fears the sport would evolve into "figure jumping."</TE>
<TE>   Midori Ito of Japan became the first woman to land a triple axel
in competition in 1989, and two years later Tonya Harding became the
first American woman to land the 31/2-revolution jump.</TE>
<TE>   Although the triple axel never became common, triple-triple jump
combinations became staples and women inched closer to the exploits
of the men, who had been doing quadruple jumps since Kurt Browning of
Canada landed a quadruple toe loop at the 1988 World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   But as women pushed the physical limits of the sport, they were
brought back to earth by hip, vertebra and other stress-related
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   No female figure skater has a triple axel in her repertoire and
none has landed one in a major international competition in at least
five years. Some have practiced it but subsequently backed off
because they couldn't master it or because they developed back or leg
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya landed a triple-triple-double combination at last year's
World Championships and hinted at a triple-triple-triple.</TE>
<TE>   However, neither she nor Kwan--the Olympic co-favorites--has
landed a clean triple-triple in competition this season. Both found
it tough to consistently balance artistic and athletic excellence,
paying a price physically and psychologically.</TE>
<TE>   "How far can the women's singles event go without destroying
bodies? And at what price?" said Sandra Bezic, a choreographer who
has worked with Olympic gold medalists Tara Lipinski, Kristi
Yamaguchi and Brian Boitano and will be a commentator for NBC at Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger they go, when they're practicing difficult jumps
while they're still growing and their bodies are changing, the more
dangerous it is. It is different for the men's event. They're always
after bigger, stronger, higher."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, second at the U.S. championships, has been working on a
quadruple salchow, in which she takes off from the back inside edge
of one skate, rotates in the air four times, and lands on the back
outside edge of the opposite foot.</TE>
<TE>   She has cleanly landed perhaps half a dozen in practice but has
fallen each of the three times she tried it in competition. She
didn't attempt it at the U.S. championships in January.</TE>
<TE>   After securing her Olympic berth, Cohen vowed to try her quad at
the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Her coach, John Nicks, backs her.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very strongly that it's not right to restrict ladies'
advanced content when everybody seems to admire the wonderful men,
and yet they feel the ladies should not be able to do this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand that. I think the lady has equal rotational
ability as a man and sometimes, much better control, and I see no
reason why ladies can't continue to progress in content."</TE>
<TE>   But Bezic believes women need not push themselves to the point of
physical breakdown if they can instead focus on finesse and
fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a necessity to continue to push technically
as far as rotations, if you continue to push the balance between
technical content and artistry," she said.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area's Real Estate Market Bust Turns Up the Heat on
Wall Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Bay Area's commercial real estate market is going
through a meltdown, and the heat is being felt all the way to Wall
Street.</LD>
<LD>   The region's collapsing rents and soaring vacancies for apartment,
industrial and office properties have undermined the performance and
raised concerns about a wide variety of large, publicly traded real
estate companies with large stakes in Bay Area real estate.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street analysts have lowered their company ratings, and some
firms have cut their earnings and revenue projections in part to
reflect the woes of the Bay Area's once-roaring property markets.
Executives who once crowed about their new San Francisco office
building or Silicon Valley apartment complex are more apt to talk
about other, better-performing markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Anyone that has a concentration in that market has a tough story
to tell," said Jim Sullivan, an office and industrial real estate
analyst with Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach. "Clearly that
market is one that is recognized by most as having dropped the
furthest, the fastest."</TE>
<TE>   In defense of the region, many real estate executives say that
concerns about San Francisco and Silicon Valley properties have been
overblown and that, in the long term, the real estate market remains
one of the most attractive in the nation. Even with the steep
declines in rents and property values, many firms said their Bay Area
properties churn out profits.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco exceeded our projections," said Nelson Rising,
chairman and chief executive of Catellus Development Corp., speaking
of his company's prominent properties and developments. "It belies
the image that things are under siege."</TE>
<TE>   But there is no question that the Bay Area's real estate market,
undermined by the failure and cutbacks at once-booming
high-technology and dot-com firms, is one of the nation's most
troubled. San Francisco is "clearly the weakest region in which we
are currently operating," said Edward H. Linde, president and chief
executive of Boston Properties Inc., in a conference call with Wall
Street analysts last month.</TE>
<TE>   Asking rents for San Francisco office space dropped by about 50%
last year while the nearly nonexistent vacancy rate for Silicon
Valley research and industrial space shot up past 12%, according to
Grubb &amp; Ellis. The apartment industry also is suffering, with rents
falling 10% to 20% during the last year and landlords offering
move-in concessions.</TE>
<TE>   These conditions have created bargains for tenants but problems
for public and privately owned real estate companies loaded with San
Francisco-area real estate. The public companies, however, have the
burden of revealing their results and facing the criticism of Wall
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Some public companies that have been stung by their exposure to
San Francisco real estate include:</TE>
<TE>   * Avalon Bay Communities Inc. The nationwide apartment company,
which owns 9,000 apartments in the Bay Area, has postponed two
projects in the area as demand weakened beyond company and Wall
Street expectations. The company's fourth-quarter net operating
income dropped largely as a result of the region's weakness.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the drag from Northern California that really caused
that," said Timothy J. Naughton, chief operating officer for Avalon
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   * Catellus Development Corp. Although the firm said its Bay Area
operations had exceeded expectations during the first three quarters
of 2001, the steep drop in demand probably would delay future leasing
and development activity at its huge Mission Bay project in San
Francisco and Pacific Commons office and industrial park in Fremont,
say analysts. As a result, the value of its land holdings may have
dropped by as much as two-thirds from the peak of the market, said
Sullivan at Green Street.</TE>
<TE>   * Equity Office Properties Trust. Merrill Lynch in January
downgraded the rating on Equity Office Properties, the largest
publicly owned real estate investment trust, from "buy" to "neutral"
and cut its operating income forecasts for 2002 in part because of
the weakness in San Francisco and Boston, which also is suffering
from troubles in the high-tech business.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based company dramatically expanded its presence in
the Bay Area last year after acquiring Spieker Properties Inc. for
more than $5 billion. As a result, Equity Office depends on San
Francisco and Silicon Valley for more than 20% of its net operating
income.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, it looks like they paid too much" for Spieker, said
David Shulman, a real estate industry analyst at Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   * Mission West Properties Inc. The owner of nearly 7 million
square feet of Silicon Valley industrial and research space has cut
its 2002 earnings estimate twice. In the fourth quarter, the firm
also took a one-time charge of $1.7 million to cover the costs of
tenants that are expected to break leases.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect the region's problems to overwhelm many of the large
public real estate companies, which have deep financial pockets and
diversified holdings spread around the country. "The balance sheets
of most of these major companies will allow them to weather the
problems," Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   But those firms will continue to face increased Wall Street
scrutiny because the San Francisco real estate markets are expected
to remain on the decline for much of 2002 despite signs of an
economic turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Some quarterly reports this year are expected to be particularly
bleak as the full effect of the real estate bust takes hold.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still some earnings risks in some of these companies,"
said Steve Sakwa, a real estate industry analyst with Merrill Lynch.
"We will be in for some tough sledding."</TE>

<HD>County Issues Alert Over Increase in HIV-Positive Babies</HD>
<DH>Health: Seven new cases are reported in January. Pregnant
women are urged to undergo testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With seven new cases of HIV reported among children in January, Los
Angeles County health officials issued a public alert Monday urging
pregnant women to be tested and treated to forestall these largely
preventable infections.</LD>
<LD>   By taking anti-AIDS drugs during pregnancy and avoiding
breastfeeding after birth, HIV-positive women can cut the chances of
passing the virus to newborns to less than 8%, said Dr. Toni
Frederick, chief epidemiologist with the county's pediatric HIV
project.</LD>
<LD>   None of the seven cases, which were identified in January by the
county Department of Health Services, involved babies infected last
month. Four of the infants were born last year and the other three
were born within the last five years, Frederick said.</LD>
<TE>   Because the state does not require doctors and hospitals to report
new HIV cases, the county must seek out this information, which can
result in delays.</TE>
<TE>   "These are babies that are sick and will carry the HIV on now
through adolescence and young adulthood," Frederick said. "It's a
pretty long course of disease that's entirely preventable."</TE>
<TE>   Some mothers of the seven infected babies declined tests for the
human immunodeficiency virus, which were offered during prenatal
visits. Others had not received prenatal care or said they had been
tested but were negative.</TE>
<TE>   Those most at risk of not receiving prenatal care--including HIV
tests--include women who are drug addicts, incarcerated, homeless,
non-English speakers, undocumented immigrants, uninsured or
teenagers, said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's director of
public health.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a woman receives no prenatal care, hospitals can take
steps to prevent HIV transmission to newborns. If the virus is
identified in a woman during childbirth--or immediately
afterward--her baby can be given drugs during the first 24 hours of
life, reducing the risk of infection.</TE>
<TE>   If the test results are known soon enough, doctors can give the
woman antiretroviral drugs during delivery. But some hospitals are
not able to provide lab results in time to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent case at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the
positive results came back too late to treat the infant and prevent
infection, said Dr. Andrea Kovacs, who heads the hospital's program
for HIV-positive women, children and adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled by that case, Kovacs said she would like to begin
offering rapid testing at the hospital, which would provide results
within an hour compared with the current four days. "We would have
treated the baby if we knew the mom was HIV-positive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In New York and elsewhere, state law requires hospitals to test
newborns for HIV, even if parents do not give consent. California
requires no tests, Frederick said.</TE>
<TE>   California physicians are required to counsel pregnant women and
offer them testing, but women have the right to refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still not aware that they can totally prevent this
terrible disease in their newborn by getting treated prenatally,"
Frederick said. The number of perinatal HIV infections in Los Angeles
County fell sharply after hitting 18 in 1996. The figure held steady
from 1998 to 2001 at four to five cases per year.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacs attributed some of the success to the hospital's outreach
efforts. Of the 200 HIV-positive women who got prenatal care in the
last five years at County-USC, none gave birth to infected infants.</TE>

<HD>In Bridge Vote, Sacramentans Go for the Gold</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Caltrans uses Internet to allow capital-area
residents to choose a color scheme for the prominent span. More than
43,000 ballots are cast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>They came, they cast ballots, they colored a bridge.</LD>
<LD>   In a most unusual election, residents of the capital region turned
to the Internet to select a new paint scheme for the Tower Bridge,
Sacramento's lofty and scenic gateway.</LD>
<LD>   More than 43,000 residents cast ballots during the past month,
selecting from three color schemes displayed in glistening renditions
on the Caltrans Web site. The final pick? (drum roll, please):</LD>
<TE>   Glittering gold.</TE>
<TE>   With 48% of the vote, gold topped a green-silver-gold combination
(38%). The burgundy-silver-gold mix trailed in third at 13%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Florida; we're not going to have a recount,"
deadpanned Jeff Morales, California Department of Transportation
director and the brains behind the Internet vote.</TE>
<TE>   Morales, who made the announcement, tipped his hand early. He came
outfitted in a solid gold tie. So did Jim Cahill, vice mayor of West
Sacramento, which is linked to the capital by the 738-foot,
twin-tower span.</TE>
<TE>   "But I would not be a politician if I didn't come prepared," he
told a crowd gathered at the foot of the bridge before the
announcement. With that, Cahill pulled out two other ties, one green,
one red.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans opted to hold the election to avoid controversy over a
color choice. Brightly lighted at night with its towers standing 110
feet above the Sacramento River's muddy waters, the bridge is one of
region's most visible landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Though no Golden Gate in size or storied history, the span enjoys
"strong emotional ties" to the community, said Jody Lonergan,
Caltrans district director.</TE>
<TE>   The vote on a bridge color is a first for Caltrans, which
typically keeps such decisions in-house.</TE>
<TE>   With chipping work, a layer of primer and two final coats, the
project won't be done until spring 2003. The paint job will cost $3.5
million, more than triple the original price for the whole bridge,
which was built in the mid-1930s for $994,000.</TE>

<HD>Young Inmates Given Job Skills</HD>
<DH>Education: They receive training for vocations such as
computer repair, fire rescue, culinary arts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixteen-year-old Tim, who has been in and out of the juvenile justice
system since he was 13, is learning to repair computers.</LD>
<LD>   His 18-year-old classmate Martel, who's serving time for receiving
stolen property, is learning how to create Web sites and set up
computer networks.</LD>
<LD>   Both are juvenile offenders serving time at Camp Kilpatrick in
Malibu, where the Los Angeles County Office of Education has
instituted a new theme-based academic system.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next few months, the county will roll out the system at
all 19 camps, offering the 22,000 juvenile wards more academically
challenging classes or preparing them for jobs, including fire
rescue, computer repair, visual arts and culinary arts.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative marks a change in direction for county schools,
which had a traditional high school curriculum offering little
vocational training.</TE>
<TE>   The county Office of Education, which oversees the camps'
instructional programs, is using Kilpatrick as a model because of its
successful decade-long experience using sports and technology
activities to reach youths and foster their interests in developing
life and job skills, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The specialized themes will be used in classes as well as
after-school workshops and training sessions. In some programs,
students, most from 14 to 18, will earn certification to become
eligible for jobs or get more extensive preparation for college
entrance exams.</TE>
<TE>   "Theme-based camps take in school instruction and integrate it
with after-school and weekend activities so that the young people get
a richer experience," said Larry Springer, director of juvenile
courts and community schools for the Office of Education. "We have
only a short time to capture these kids' imaginations and get them
focused on what the rest of their lives are going to be about."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to psychological and behavioral evaluations done when
juvenile offenders are processed, the youths will be assessed
academically to determine which of the camps best meets their
scholastic needs and interests.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't work with every kid," Chief Probation Officer Richard
Shumsky said. "Some kids will go back to their old environment and
slip back into the same conduct [that landed them in the camps]. But,
for a lot of kids, it's mind opening."</TE>
<TE>   Ten themes will be implemented, with as many as four at any one
camp. They include science and technology; independent living;
college preparation; music and visual arts; vocational training;
agribusiness; computer technology; fire; and sports. Two camps,
Mendenhall and Munz in Lake Hughes, will have a regional theme, which
will allow them to develop programs in partnership with area
businesses and nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   Every camp also will have a more intensive literacy program,
because, as Shumsky put it, "too many kids come into the system not
knowing how to read."</TE>
<TE>   The county Probation Department has received a $100,000 grant from
Verizon Corp. to establish libraries at all county camps and juvenile
halls, said Juanita Stanley, program manager for Operation Read.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department, which runs the juvenile camps on an
$85-million annual budget, can implement the theme-based system
without much extra funding, said Shumsky, who added that he hopes to
form more partnerships with area community colleges to offer some of
the courses.</TE>
<TE>   The county Office of Education might also apply for grants to
augment the camp funding, Springer said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Camp Kilpatrick, four others already have begun to
integrate the themes: Glenn Rockey in San Dimas, Scudder in Saugus,
Routh in Tujunga and Paige in La Verne.</TE>
<TE>   By July 1, the other 14 will do so, said Margo Minecki, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Kilpatrick turned what was once a small video
editing workshop open to a handful of detainees into a six-class
technology program offering certification for jobs in computer repair
and system networking, instructor Roger Espinosa said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know how to take a computer apart, put one together, set up
the Internet," said Kilpatrick technology student Tim, whose last
name cannot be used because he is a ward of the court. "This is what
got me to decide what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much know how to build a new [computer] system," added
his classmate, Martel, who hopes to go on to college.</TE>

<HD>Jury Urges Death for Gang Member</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Monday recommended the death
penalty for a gang member accused of a series of murders in 1995 from
Washington state to the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   Run Peter Chhoun, 29, the suspected leader of the San
Bernardino-based Tiny Rascals, was convicted last month, along with
co-defendant Samreth Sam Pan, 25, of the murders of three people in
Los Angeles County and Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   A jury last week recommended that Pan be sentenced to death.</LD>
<TE>   Chhoun and Pan were found guilty of murdering Nghiep Thich Le, 48,
and his father, Hung Dieu Le, 73, of Sacramento during a home
invasion robbery; and Miguel Vargas Avina, 20, of Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said Avina was shot because Chhoun and Pan
mistakenly thought he was a rival gang member.</TE>
<TE>   The two also were convicted of burglarizing and robbing the Le
home and of the attempted murder of Nghiep Le's wife, Quyen Luu, 49,
who was shot in the hip.</TE>
<TE>   Chhoun is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Robert Perry on March
12. Sentencing for Pan is scheduled March 13.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Los Angeles and Sacramento cases, Chhoun has been
sentenced to death on his conviction for the August 1995
home-invasion murders of a family of five in a San Bernardino County
case.</TE>
<TE>   He and Pan also have been sentenced to life in prison for the
shooting death of a rival gang member in San Bernardino County that
same month.</TE>
<TE>   Chhoun also has been charged with the murders of a Spokane, Wash.,
couple in July 1995. That case is pending.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Push to Revive Economic Strategy Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With California facing a $10-billion budget shortfall, state
lawmakers are wondering why Gov. Gray Davis never got around to
appointing anyone to the state's Economic Strategy Panel.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature established the panel in 1993 to hold public
hearings on the state's economy and its prospects for prosperity, as
well as to spot emerging industries.</LD>
<LD>   But the group last met at a retreat in December 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Davis is supposed to appoint eight of the panel's 14 members. Now
in the final year of his first term, he hasn't filled any of the
positions, even as the state has fallen on economic hard times.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. John Vasconcellos, the Santa Clara Democrat who heads
the Senate Select Committee on Economic Development, and his Assembly
counterpart, Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno), held a joint hearing Monday to
push things along.</TE>
<TE>   They invited economists, educators and bureaucrats to address the
need for long-range economic planning in California.</TE>
<TE>   Vasconcellos described California as "woefully" without a plan,
and in an interview suggested he got tired of waiting for Davis to
fill the panel. "I've asked him a dozen times," Vasconcellos said.
"Finally it became clear I could no longer just ask."</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Salazar, with California's Technology, Trade &amp; Commerce
Agency, said seven of the eight appointments are before the governor
and he described the appointments as imminent. Salazar's agency is
mandated to operate the panel and his boss, Secretary Lon Hatamiya,
is supposed to head the group.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a consulting
firm, and author of several studies on the Silicon Valley economy,
called for the strategy panel to begin meeting so that the state
won't be caught off-guard the next time it runs into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "We should never be sitting here wondering again why we have a
budget deficit," Henton said. "We could have anticipated the bubble

<TE>   Nick Bollman, chairman of the Speaker's Commission on Regionalism,
also recommended that the panel be revitalized. California, he said,
is a state of regions, and state government needs to be in a position
to respond to the regions' different needs.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 7, Missing From Home Is Feared Abducted</HD>
<DH>Search: Danielle van Dam was put to bed Friday night and
has not been seen since. Parents plead for her return.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Police on Monday said they had no clues and no suspects in the
disappearance of a 7-year-old girl reported missing by her parents
Saturday from the family's home in an upscale neighborhood here.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a mystery," said police spokesman Dave Cohen. He said the
case is being treated as an abduction.</LD>
<LD>   At their home in the Sabre Springs neighborhood, Brenda and Damon
van Dam issued a tearful plea for the return of their daughter,
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<TE>   "We have no enemies," Damon van Dam said. "We have no idea who
would want to hurt our family."</TE>
<TE>   His wife added, "It's a nightmare. We just want her back. That's
all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   The couple described Danielle as 4 feet tall and 58 pounds, with
blue eyes and blond hair. She was wearing blue pajamas with a flower
pattern when her father, a software test engineer at Qualcomm, put
her to bed at around 10:30 p.m. Friday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam said he found a sliding glass door in the family
room open several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam told police she was with friends at a bar until
2:30 a.m. Saturday and did not check her daughter's room when she
returned home. Her husband had remained home with Danielle and the
couple's two sons. Danielle's disappearance was not noted until 9
a.m. Saturday, the parents told police.</TE>
<TE>   Searchers from several law enforcement agencies scoured canyons
near the family home Saturday and Sunday. The search was scaled back
Monday, although helicopters and tracking dogs were still in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Police were concentrating on interviewing neighbors and others.
Fliers with the girl's picture were posted throughout the
neighborhood and in nearby Poway.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam has worked for four years for an engineering firm
under contract to Qualcomm's satellite division. He was set to take
the family to Italy this week on a business trip.</TE>
<TE>   The parents said that, at the request of police, they took a
lie-detector test. Cohen declined to confirm that such a test was
given.</TE>
<TE>   The case has traumatized the neighborhood, 25 miles north of
downtown San Diego. A neighborhood park has a banner with pink and
purple ribbons that says: "Hurry Home Danielle. We Miss You."</TE>
<TE>   A phone line has been established for anyone with information:
(888) 664-6664.</TE>

<HD>Jones Seeks U.S. Probe Into Davis' Power Deals</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor had 'insider dealings' during last
year's energy talks, GOP candidate alleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones, lagging in the polls for the
Republican gubernatorial primary, on Monday asked the U.S. attorney's
office in Sacramento to investigate possible conflicts of interest
between energy companies and the administration of Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Jones has criticized Davis for hiring consultants
during last year's energy crisis who owned stock in companies that
the governor alleged were gouging the state. Davis' spokesman held
$12,000 of stock in Calpine, a firm that won state contracts.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Jones said the state Fair Political Practices
Commission and the attorney general's office, both controlled by
Democrats, were not investigating aggressively enough.</LD>
<TE>   Seizing upon recent reports that Davis met with then-Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay during the crisis, Jones called for a federal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is now time that the U.S. attorney's office actively engage in
this scandal and open an investigation into the conflicts of interest
and insider dealings of Gov. Gray Davis and his administration,"
Jones said at a Sacramento news conference. "Because we cannot get to
the truth and we cannot get the entities entrusted by the people to
do their jobs, we must now go to a higher authority."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis campaign, said the
governor had taken appropriate action against consultants who had
conflicts, dismissing four last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The chairwoman of the FPPC responded coolly to Jones' allegations.
"We do not comment on complaints or any investigative actions taken
in response to those complaints," Karen Getman said. "Nor do we allow
the timing of our activities to be influenced by upcoming elections."</TE>
<TE>   Though Jones called for more disclosure into Davis' contacts with
the energy industry, he has different standards for the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Beth Pendexter said Jones believes Vice President Dick
Cheney does not have to disclose whom he met with while forming the
national energy policy last year.</TE>

<LD>Nothing seems to escape controversy anymore, so why shouldn't there
be a dispute over who invented the square watermelon?</LD>
<LD>   While recent news reports credited farmers in Japan, Kurt Dahlin,
a Manhattan Beach church pastor, says he was the originator.</LD>
<LD>   Dahlin began growing the edgy fruit in 1986 by accident--a seed
fell between some cinder blocks and, well ... (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   "It saves space, it slices nicely, and it doesn't affect the
flavor," said Dahlin, who grows about 10 a year "just for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Some Japanese markets now sell large square melons at $80 to $100
apiece. Reports by CNN and other outlets said the Japanese began
growing them first two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But if that's so, why are we just hearing about it now?" asked
the pastor. "Where's the evidence? I have photos back to 1986."</TE>
<TE>   Dahlin thinks there's a possibility that an article on his square
treats in the local Beach Reporter a few years ago may have given
Japanese farmers the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "America needs heroes," Dahlin said with mock solemnity, "and
what's more heroic than a square melon?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Duh!" award winner: Dale Batesole of Garden Grove and several
other readers nominated one magazine's scientific discovery (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Someone made a miraculous comeback? Brian Jones passed along a
classified ad from a Santa Clarita Valley publication that raised a
few questions (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second lives (cont.): The discussions here of company signs that
were altered in ingenious ways when businesses changed hands brought
a story from Christine Haden of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   She remembered a co-worker's wedding reception where "there was a
serious discussion going on about whether the name of the band might
be offensive to the bride's mother, who had yet to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "The band displayed a small felt banner bearing their name--One
Night Stand--on the bass drum. The band leader argued that
advertising was part of the deal, but the family was unrelenting.</TE>
<TE>   They finally compromised by folding over part of the banner so
that the entire name was no longer visible.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus," Haden concluded, "Night Stand made its debut."</TE>
<TE>   But just for one night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staying in character: Visiting the Mystery Book Store in Westwood,
writer Hank Rosenfeld asked a clerk at the front desk, "Where is
Dashiell Hammett?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's dead," the clerk responded.</TE>
<TE>   It struck Rosenfeld as the type of terse wisecrack that Hammett's
Sam Spade might have uttered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Failed power play: When he was honored by the Southern California
Sports Broadcasters on Monday, L.A. Kings hockey announcer Bob Miller
recounted the time when then-owner Jack Kent Cooke ordered him to
weave the sponsors into his play-by-play.</TE>
<TE>   For example, said Cooke--a one-time door-to-door encyclopedia
salesman, Miller could say, "There's [Kings star] Marcel Dionne
scooting down the ice like a Datsun."</TE>
<TE>   Miller refused and Cooke left him in the driver's seat, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: On their road to the Super Bowl title, they scored
victories over the two teams that deserted the City of Angels--the
Raiders and the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the world may call the new champs the New England
Patriots. I prefer to think of them as the real L.A. Avengers, not
the Arena Football League team that uses that name.</TE>

<HD>Web Site Prompts FBI Arrest of Man on Explosives Charges</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Sherman Oaks resident, 19, is accused of posting
instructions on how to build, use weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FBI agents in New York City have arrested a Sherman Oaks teenager for
allegedly using the Internet to distribute information on how to
build a wide variety of explosive devices.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest late Sunday of Sherman Martin Austin, 19, came two
weeks after federal agents with a search warrant seized two partially
constructed Molotov cocktails, a remote detonator and other items
from Austin's residence, according to a federal affidavit.</LD>
<LD>   The affidavit also alleges that Austin's Web site included
instructions on how to make and use weapons ranging from slingshots
and boomerangs to smoke bombs and fuel-fertilizer explosives.</LD>
<TE>   Austin's New York attorney could not be reached for comment, but
his mother denied that her son had any involvement in making
explosives or encouraging others to do so. "At this point in time, I
don't want to make this a high-profile drama," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is innocent," she added. "These are bogus charges. He is a
peaceful person. We are a peaceful family."</TE>
<TE>   Austin's Web site, according to the affidavit, stated: "Many
different weapons and tools can be used in street fighting. Make sure
that you keep them clean of fingerprints, DNA fibers (hair follicles,
etc.), especially explosives, because they may not always ignite."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the Web site, the affidavit says, was the
following message on how to "defeat" police tactics:
"One would attack the poorly defended positions by hurling rocks and
firebombs. Since regular police could not sustain that for any longer
period of time, the riot police would have to come to their aid. Then the
second group of protestors would attack the now much weakened main
objectives and possibly seize them."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said Austin was in Manhattan last week to
protest the World Economic Forum and was arrested by New York police
Saturday for allegedly participating in an unlawful assembly and
disorderly conduct.</TE>
<TE>   A police search in New York of Austin's car, according to the
affidavit, turned up electrical wiring, electrical tape, an empty
gasoline container and anarchist literature.</TE>
<TE>   After his release by New York police, FBI agents there took Austin
into custody Sunday on a federal warrant that alleges he possessed a
Molotov cocktail and used his Web site to post instructions on
explosive devices with the intent that they would be used to commit
federal crimes.</TE>

<HD>Role of Class Size in Success Unclear</HD>
<DH>Education: Study cannot separate the 20-student limit from
other reforms in explaining academic improvements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About two-thirds of California school districts are taking money from
other programs to reduce class sizes in the first three grades,
according to a study released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite those efforts, the report's authors said they could not
definitively say that the 20-1 student-to-teacher ratio in those
lower classes has spurred the recent academic improvement among
California's schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   A consortium of think tanks found that nearly all California
public school districts have adopted the size reduction program since
the $8-billion experiment began six years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The 162-page study was headed by the American Institutes for
Research and the Rand Corp. and covers 1999 to early 2001--before
California's economy began to slide. Now, a statewide budget crisis
is forcing many districts to make funding cuts and some are
discussing whether to opt out of the class-size program.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine school system in Orange County has decided to increase
its primary class sizes, and even the Los Angeles Unified School
District toyed with the idea during budget talks last month.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the current budget problems, most California districts
reported that they had to trim other spending, such as teacher
training, music classes and library budgets, to help implement
class-size reductions, according to the study. A third said they
shifted teachers from upper grades, which led to crowding there. Many
districts complained that the state wasn't allocating enough money
for the new ratios, leaving local systems to make up an average of
$150 per student.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this raises the question of whether some of the money that
is used for class-size reduction might not be more productively used
elsewhere," RAND researcher Georges Vernez said. "I think that's
probably a debate that should take place."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Stecher, the report's co-author, said it is impossible to
separate positive effects of smaller classes from other simultaneous
reforms, such as new testing and reading programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The test scores are going up, which means that something good has
been going on," he said. "But what is hard to do is attribute that
progress to one thing or another.</TE>
<TE>   State Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, a strong
proponent of the class-size plan, said she was unfazed by the report.
She noted that the greatest improvements in reading and math test
scores are found among elementary school students, despite the
disproportionate numbers of inexperienced teachers in the lower
grades.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you rather have a new teacher with 20 students or 32
students?" she asked. "I think a little bit of common sense has to be
applied here."</TE>
<TE>   Eastin and the authors of the report said many intangible benefits
are hard to quantify. For example, the report found that teachers are
spending more time with individual students in smaller classes and
have fewer discipline problems.</TE>

<HD>Bush Tax Plan Would Assist Varied Groups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philanthropists, teachers, students, people who buy their own health
insurance or drive a car powered by alternative fuels would all get
new tax breaks under the budget proposal President Bush unveiled
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Coming on the heels of the big tax cut the president engineered
last year, Bush's tax-relief package calls for an array of new tax
breaks for individuals and businesses that could amount to $591
billion in tax savings over 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Many of them are familiar--past proposals that haven't become law.
None of the new breaks Bush is backing will provide any relief to
taxpayers, of course, unless they are approved by Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a rundown:</TE>
<TE>   * Charity: Taxpayers who do not itemize deductions would be able
to deduct a limited amount of their charitable contributions. Under
current law, the 90 million taxpayers who claim the standard
deduction can't deduct gifts to charities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Bush proposal, individuals who don't itemize would be
able to take up to $100 in charitable contribution deductions in
2002, and married couples could deduct up to $200.</TE>
<TE>   Allowable charitable deductions by non-itemizers would rise to
$500 per person, $1,000 per couple, by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers also would be able to contribute assets from their
individual retirement accounts to charity, without first claiming the
contributed amount as income.</TE>
<TE>   Charities also would be able to obtain tax-exempt status more
quickly, if their primary purpose was to provide social services to
the poor and needy.</TE>
<TE>   * Students: About 4.5 million elementary and secondary school
students are stuck in schools that provide inadequate education,
according to the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of those children would be able to get a refundable tax
credit equal to 50% of the first $5,000 of qualifying elementary and
secondary education expenses if they flee those failing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying expenses would include the cost of transportation,
tutoring, books, fees, uniforms and tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses incurred in the 2002-2003 school year would be eligible
for the credit. The credit would expire in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   * Teachers: Teachers who spend their own money equipping their
classrooms would be able to deduct up to $400 in out-of-pocket
expenses starting in 2003, even if they don't itemize.</TE>
<TE>   The deductions would only apply to books, supplies and equipment
that become school property. Teacher-training expenses related to
current teaching positions would also qualify, but not travel or
lodging expenses, or costs related to religious instruction.</TE>
<TE>   * Uninsured workers: Low-income workers who buy health insurance
would qualify for a new refundable tax credit aimed at reimbursing
them for a portion of the premium starting in 2003. The maximum
credit of $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married couples would
be available to singles earning up to $15,000 and married couples
earning up to $25,000. The credit phases out at higher income levels,
expiring completely when single income hits $30,000 and joint income
reaches $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Long-term care: Currently, long-term care insurance expenses are
only deductible to the extent that the taxpayer's total medical
expenses--including these premiums--add up to more than 7.5% of
adjusted gross income. That precludes most taxpayers from making use
of the deduction.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would give workers, who pay at least 50% of the cost
of long-term care insurance, a deduction for a portion of the cost
starting in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Health-care spending accounts: New rules would give workers who
contribute to health-care spending accounts more flexibility in using
their savings.</TE>
<TE>   Many large companies allow their workers to use these accounts to
save for expected medical costs. The worker's contributions are taken
out of paychecks before tax, reducing taxable income. But any amount
left at the end of the year is lost.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal would allow up to $500 in unspent funds to be
carried over to the next year, contributed to that worker's defined
contribution retirement plan, or distributed directly to the worker
starting in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   If the worker chose to have the money distributed, it would be
considered pay and become taxable.</TE>
<TE>   * Medical savings accounts: Another type of medical savings plan,
"Archer MSAs," would be revamped and made more widely available
starting in 2003. These accounts, which are only available to
self-employed individuals and those employed by very small companies,
would become available to all. These programs combine high-deductible
health insurance with a tax-free savings account.</TE>
<TE>   * Caretakers: Taxpayers who care for an ailing relative in their
homes would be able to claim that relative as a dependent, even if
they provide only half of that individual's support. The provision,
aimed at helping taxpayers who keep their parents and grandparents
out of convalescent homes by caring for them at home, would be
effective in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Disabled workers: Disabled workers, whose employers provide them
with computers and software allowing them to work at home, will be
able to exclude the value of that equipment from income starting in
2004. Currently, these exclusions are available only if the
individual uses the equipment exclusively for work.</TE>
<TE>   * Farming, fishing and ranching: This would allow individuals
engaged in farming, fishing and ranching businesses to create
tax-favored savings accounts to help them handle bad years, starting
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Low-income housing: There are already tax credits available to
those who develop affordable multifamily housing. The Bush proposal
would extend credits to those who build single-family housing for
low-income families too, starting in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy credits: Individuals who bought solar energy systems for
their homes, or bought cars that ran on hybrid and fuel-cell
technologies would qualify for tax credits starting in 2002. The
credits would be temporary, ending Dec. 31, 2007.</TE>
<TE>   * Business breaks: A series of tax breaks would also be extended
to businesses that helped low-income workers save, or that produced
alternative energy, or that gave food or a large portion of their
income to charity.</TE>
<TE>   "Extenders": The Bush proposal also aims to make all of last
summer's tax-law changes permanent and extend a series of expiring
tax provisions.</TE>

<HD>Senators Move to Subpoena Ex-Enron Chief</HD>
<DH>Hearings: SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt testifies while
investigators take steps to force Kenneth L. Lay's testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators prepared Monday to subpoena former Enron
Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay to appear before their panels, while
the Justice Department rejected calls for the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate the energy giant's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing on Capitol Hill, the nation's top securities
regulator confirmed his agency postponed a routine review of Enron's
financial statements in 2000, in part because Enron appeared to be
healthy.</LD>
<LD>   And the head of Enron's internal investigating committee urged
lawmakers to fix underlying problems that led to Enron's collapse,
but dodged questions of whether he uncovered criminal wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   Lay's abrupt decision Sunday to cancel his appearance before House
and Senate committees angered lawmakers. "It's theoretically possible
that Mr. Lay as CEO did not know what was going on beneath him," said
Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.). "But the documents give the
impression that there were so many transactions taking place over so
long a period of time that, to believe that, you would have to
conclude that Mr. Lay was the most out-to-lunch CEO of any
corporation in America."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Commerce Committee--before which Lay was to appear
Monday--will vote today on issuing a subpoena to force him to appear
Feb. 12. He can invoke his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination, but lawmakers say they still want Lay to show up.
The House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, which
was to hear from Lay today, voted unanimously Monday to authorize
issuance of a subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R-Ohio) attempted to subpoena Lay to force him to appear at
today's hearing. Lay's attorney refused to accept the subpoena on his
client's behalf, saying he had not been authorized to do so, said
committee spokeswoman Peggy Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, were not returned.
Silbert has told Congress that Lay declined to appear voluntarily
because of comments made by lawmakers over the weekend suggesting
that a "prosecutorial" tone would pervade hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers on the subcommittee chastised Lay for refusing to
appear; one called Lay's excuse "lame," and another likened it to
"taking the Fifth in absentia."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on consumer affairs, contended that Lay had bowed out
after an internal Enron investigation released over the weekend
offered a "devastating indictment of a number of things that went on
inside the corporation."</TE>
<TE>   "Congress is determined to get to the bottom of what has happened
with this corporation," Dorgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 after
questions about its accounting practices and the revelation of
off-the-books partnerships that hid hundreds of millions in losses
caused its stock to plummet, costing more than 6,000 employees their
jobs and investors billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who was ousted as Enron chairman and chief executive last
month, also announced Monday that he was resigning as a director of
the Houston company.</TE>
<TE>   Without Lay as the star witness on Capitol Hill, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt took a mild grilling
Monday from members of the House Financial Services subcommittee on
capital markets, who questioned why the SEC did not uncover problems
at Enron earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt confirmed reports that the SEC had postponed a review of
Enron's financial statements scheduled for the year 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was deferred in the expectation that there were new standards
that were coming up," Pitt said. "I think there was also some
suggestion that because the company was apparently performing so well
there were decisions that could be deferred."</TE>
<TE>   Closer government scrutiny of Enron's complicated financial
dealings might have prevented or lessened the damage, some lawmakers
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "If only the SEC had read those footnotes, we might be in a better
position now," said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   At the same hearing, William C. Powers, chairman of Enron's
special investigating committee, told lawmakers that Enron broke
accounting rules and engaged in deals that improperly enriched
executives.</TE>
<TE>   "What we found was appalling," said Powers, dean of the University
of Texas law school, who joined Enron's board late last year to head
up the internal inquiry. "We found a systemic and pervasive attempt
by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial
condition."</TE>
<TE>   He resisted questions from lawmakers about whether Enron's actions
were criminal, saying such matters should be determined by the SEC
and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt declined to comment on the agency's investigation, but said
he was "outraged" by the allegations in the Powers report, adding
that they may constitute "fraud" if proven accurate.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll shows strong public support for the appointment of an
independent counsel to take over the criminal probe. Such a step was
endorsed Monday by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the Commerce
Committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got an Enron government," he said. Citing the Bush
administration's denials of doing anything to help Enron, Hollings
added: "To say 'No help here' is like 'I did not have political
relations with that man, Mr. Lay.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department rejected the idea of appointing an
outside counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department began probing allegations of securities
fraud and document destruction last month, and it asked the White
House last week to preserve all documents connected to the company--a
sign that its criminal investigation is expanding. Nonetheless, the
Justice Department said in a statement Monday that it "sees no
reason" to appoint a special counsel to look into the Enron case. It
noted that department regulations call for the attorney general to
appoint a special counsel when prosecution by its own lawyers would
present a conflict and serve the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither of these criteria exist ... in this case," the department
said.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and the entire U.S. attorney's Houston
office have recused themselves from the Enron investigation because
of potential conflicts--Ashcroft because of political contributions
he received as a senator and the office because of personal contacts
with Enron employees.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fitzgerald agreed with Hollings on subpoenaing Lay, he
disagreed on the need for a special counsel. "This is a corporate
scandal," Fitzgerald said. "I don't believe that anyone in the Bush
administration was aware that there was what appears to me to have
been a pyramid scheme going on in Enron Corp."</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll of 1,545 adults nationwide, conducted Jan. 31-Feb.
3 with a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, found
Americans remain suspicious of whether the Bush administration can
conduct an impartial probe of a major campaign contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, the AFL-CIO asked the SEC to ban Enron directors from
serving on other boards, citing the "substantial unfitness" of board
members outlined in the Powers report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Eric Lichtblau in Washington and Nancy Rivera
Brooks and Nancy Cleeland in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Drive-In Designated as a Landmark</HD>
<DH>History: New status may hinder Azusa Pacific University's
plan to raze the theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preservationists say a state commission's decision to designate an
Azusa drive-in movie theater as a historic landmark will make it much
harder for Azusa Pacific University to demolish the county's last
single-screen outdoor theater.</LD>
<LD>   The Azusa Foothill Drive-In Theatre appeared to be doomed when the
Christian university paid $6.1 million for the property last year to
house new campus facilities.</LD>
<LD>   But preservationists on Friday convinced the state Historical
Resources Commission to designate the last drive-in on Route 66 west
of Oklahoma a state landmark.</LD>
<TE>   "This makes it a lot harder to knock it down," said Trudi
Sandmeier, an advocate for the Los Angeles Conservancy, a
preservation group that nominated the drive-in for landmark status.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-acre drive-in won't join the California Register of
Historic Places because the owner has not consented as the law
requires. But the commission's decision that it is eligible for the
list means any new project and demolition face extra obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Sandmeier said that before any demolition, the property's owner
will now need to conduct a study of the environmental effects,
examine alternative uses and produce evidence to justify approval of
the project by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Sandmeier said the state decision gives the university a reason to
sit down with preservationists to discuss how it could make use of
the existing structures in a new project, much like the old Bullock's
Wilshire was adapted to be part of the Southwestern Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a large site and the drive-in could be kept on a smaller
scale as part of a wider project," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa Councilman Dick Stanford said it is the 44,000 residents of
the foothills community 25 miles northeast of Los Angeles who will
lose, thanks to the commission's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford said the Azusa City Council voted 4 to 1 in November to
oppose the landmark designation, but the state board opted to listen
to out-of-towners instead. The council, he said, opposed it because
the venue is not economically viable and hardly resembles the
drive-in of its glory days.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no kids playground, car speakers or much of anything
else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman said he suspects that if the council goes through
the environmental report process and approves a project at the
location, the conservancy will use the historic designation to file
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa Pacific President Jon Wallace said he does not know what to
make of the decision, but he knows it will mean extra hurdles if the
school opts to tear down the marquee, snack bar and metal screen. "We
are not in the drive-in business, we're in business of education," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old drive-in at 675 E. Foothill Blvd. is wedged
between the university's new event center and its athletic fields and
parking lots. The university has yet to submit a proposal for the
site to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Movies continue to be shown there seasonally under a deal with
Pacific Theatres, from whom the university acquired the drive-in.
Films were last shown over the Christmas holidays. It is also used
for a swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa Mayor Cristina Madrid said the state's decision gives her
foothills community an opportunity to save its past and build a new
identity and future around a Route 66 theme.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fabulous icon of a bygone era," she said. "This was the
place to be with the A&amp;W Root Beer and an original McDonald's
nearby."</TE>
<TE>   Madrid complains that Stanford is a pawn for the conservative
university, where he lectures part time and his wife is a faculty
member, and that he was at least "morally conflicted" when he voted
on the issue recently.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with preservation. She is anti-university
and she'll do anything to slow them down," said Stanford. The mayor,
he said, is out of step with those who want progress.</TE>

<HD>Testimony About Sex Is Barred in Dog-Mauling Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge will allow jurors to hear about defendants'
alleged ties to the Aryan Nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge Monday barred testimony in the San Francisco
dog-mauling trial involving the defendants' alleged sexual conduct
with their dogs, but said jurors would be allowed to hear about their
ties to a white supremacist prison gang.</LD>
<LD>   The case involves defendants Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, the
married owners of two Presa Canario dogs that attacked lacrosse coach
Diane Whipple on Jan. 26, 2001, as she was trying to unlock her
apartment door in San Francisco. Whipple was killed.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Attys. James Hammer and Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom
have argued that Knoller and Noel "actively encouraged the vicious
nature" of the dogs as part of a scheme with Pelican Bay State Prison
inmates Paul "Cornfed" Schneider and Dale Bretches to breed and train
aggressive attack dogs.</LD>
<TE>   The prosecutors argued that the defendants, both of whom are
lawyers, and the inmates were involved in a conspiracy with the white
supremacist Aryan Nation Brotherhood to run an attack dog operation
outside prison.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors will be allowed to introduce evidence about
their ties to the group, they will not be allowed to describe it as a
white supremacist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Nedra Ruiz, Knoller's attorney, argued that neither her client nor
Noel had any relationship with the Aryan Brotherhood as a group,
although she conceded that Schneider was a member.</TE>
<TE>   She said the Aryan Brotherhood testimony would merely bias the
jury. "To allow the prosecution to argue that the Aryan Brotherhood
is responsible for this horrible tragedy ... is to allow them to try
my client with material that is irrelevant, immaterial and incredibly
inflammatory," Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer countered strongly.</TE>
<TE>   "These defendants were part of a conspiracy between much of the
Aryan Brotherhood to breed, raise, train and sell aggressive dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer and Newsom also sought to introduce testimony regarding
sexual matters involving the couple and the dogs, but no details have
been released on how that relates to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   However, they have argued in court papers that evidence revealing
the closeness of the relationship between Noel and Knoller and
Schneider would help the jury assess whether any testimony provided
in the trial by the inmate was biased in the defendant's favor.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that information may come out in a series of letters that
Judge James Warren agreed to allow prosecutors to show jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Warren also agreed to allow a video showing one of the dogs and
others of her breed barking and jumping around and to permit experts
to testify whether the dogs' actions reveal an aggressive nature.
Both sides will offer expert testimony about the dogs' actions shown
in the video.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being held in Los Angeles because Warren ruled
earlier that Knoller and Noel could not get a fair trial in San
Francisco because of publicity in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, and Noel, 60, face charges of involuntary
manslaughter and keeping vicious dogs. Knoller, who was with the dogs
during the attack, also is charged with second-degree murder. She
could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Noel
could get four years.</TE>
<TE>   The attack happened as Knoller emerged from her apartment with the
two dogs on a leash. Whipple was carrying groceries and was trying to
get into her apartment when the dogs broke away and attacked her. One
dog, known as Bane, attacked her throat, as the other dog, Hera,
ripped at her clothes. Both have been euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Opening statements in the trial are expected to start Feb. 19.</TE>

<HD>Baxter Ward, 82; Political Maverick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baxter Ward, the high-profile television anchor-cum-politician who
served two terms on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors but
failed twice in widely separated bids to become mayor of Los Angeles,
died Monday. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, who was a county supervisor from 1972 to 1980, died in a
Kirkland, Wash., hospital two weeks after he was diagnosed with lung
cancer, said his son, Torrey Ward. The senior Ward moved to
Washington state in 1994 and wrote an unpublished book about politics
in Los Angeles and Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Edwardian gentleman. Unmuzzled pit bull. Diminutive, pale,
immaculate "germaphobe" who wouldn't shake hands. Maverick. A sincere
and entertaining television anchor, able to deliver "hard news with a
soft touch, camp with calamity, satire with sensationalism,
fast-breaking news with fast break-ups." Eccentric muckraker. Gadfly.
Visionary who 30 years ago proposed high-speed trains on freeways and
feeder trolleys on flood-control channels. Champion of the little
guy. Loose cannon.</LD>
<TE>   Those terms and more were used to describe Baxter Ward during his
four decades on TV screens and in the public meeting rooms of Los
Angeles. But politician?</TE>
<TE>   "No. No," the man who ran in half a dozen elections told a Times
interviewer in 1988. "Politician? Heavens!"</TE>
<TE>   Well, an unusual one at least. Ward refused to accept campaign
contributions, running one mayoral campaign for $8,800 out of his own
pocket. He wasn't even sure he was a Democrat, once telling the
Sherman Oaks Democratic Club he thought he was registered as a
decline-to-state voter, until a member produced records proving him a
sure-enough registered Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   The dark-haired media don with the familiar baritone made his
first bid for public office in 1969 when he ran for mayor. He
finished third behind past and future Mayors Sam Yorty and Tom
Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Ward defeated incumbent Supervisor Warren Dorn and four
years later won reelection to the 5th Supervisorial District covering
parts of the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys and
reaching into Pasadena, San Marino and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   He was ousted in 1980 by conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich,
and after several years' hiatus failed to recapture that seat in 1988
and again failed to gain the mayor's office in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ward's supporters nor detractors ever were quite sure
whether his tenure was good for the district, but they all knew he
made it interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Ward was largely credited with dislodging the cozy old-boy system
of the board, previously known as "the five little kings" for
supervisors' power over individual districts. A gentleman in person,
Ward was anything but courtly to his colleagues when he accused them
of catering to special interests and publicized their campaign
contributions from developers and others.</TE>
<TE>   Former Supervisor Ernest E. Debs once complained that volatile
board encounters with Ward left him feeling like a wet dishrag. Debs
and two other county officials later filed disability claims,
attributing their heart conditions partly to Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assessor Philip E. Watson sued Ward for defamation after
Ward prompted the grand jury to investigate Watson. Former Los
Angeles County Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess, another target of several
Ward investigations, called Ward "one of the most destructive men
we've had in county government ... [who] did everything to destroy
the public confidence and faith and belief in county government."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. John Van de Kamp defended
Ward's probe of Watson, saying indictments might have resulted had
Watson not resigned. And health officials said Ward's inquiry into
nursing home mistreatment of patients led to dozens of prosecutions
of poor operators.</TE>
<TE>   "If the evidence were brought of fraud, theft, misuse, if there
were scoundrels abounding, by all means those matters should be
inquired into," Ward told The Times near the end of his political
career. "I think the public's interests are to be protected as best
the county can."</TE>
<TE>   Former Supervisor Ed Edelman, a liberal who served with Ward from
his own election in 1975 until 1980, said Monday that Ward "was a
colorful and unique elected official who cut an interesting swath....
I enjoyed working with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a force to be reckoned with in the county. He was somewhat
of a reformer, sort of a maverick. He did some things that were good,
like bringing attention to mass transit, along with [former
Supervisor] Kenny Hahn and me," Edelman said. "On the other hand,
Baxter sometimes stepped beyond the bounds of propriety, as when he
had his investigators rifling the desks of employees. That was his
zealot style."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Ward pursued his public duties as an officeholder
much as he had pursued his version of news--searching for the
dishonesty of politicians and bureaucrats and trying to help
homeowners with zoning battles and high taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Until Proposition 13 chopped property taxes and killed the
project, Ward successfully launched the nation's first county-owned
commuter train. Critics branded the short-lived train between San
Diego and Los Angeles "Baxter's choo choo." But the experiment did
convince Amtrak to adopt the route.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving office, Ward wrote a much-revised and oft-rejected
mystery novel based on Proposition 13. The book, he once joked, "has
been as unsuccessful as any of my transit efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Born Baxter Ward Schwellenbach on Nov. 5, 1919, in Superior, Wis.,
he grew up in Ephrata, Wash. (population 500), where his father
became district attorney and later chief justice of the Washington
State Supreme Court. An uncle, U.S. Sen. Lewis Schwellenbach, who
served as President Harry S Truman's secretary of Labor, caused Ward
to drop the family surname so that his broadcasting career wouldn't
interfere with the senator's work.</TE>
<TE>   Ward landed his first job as a news announcer at Seattle's radio
station KRSC when he was 16. He worked there and in Spokane for three
years, and studied sporadically at the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He spent four years and three months in the Army during World War
II, as an infantryman stationed in Africa, Italy, France, Germany and
England but never seeing battle.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he took classes at George Washington University and
joined ABC radio and then its television station in Washington, D.C.
He worked as a news reporter in Baltimore from 1952 to 1955, when he
moved to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For the next six years, Ward served as news director, producer and
anchorman for KCOP-TV Channel 13. He found even greater public
exposure as news director and anchorman for KABC-TV Channel 7 from
1962 until 1969, when he resigned to run for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Only what interested Baxter got on the air," said Jeanie
Kasindorf, his sometime writer, in an article she did on Ward for Los
Angeles magazine in 1970. That meant personal stories like a
homeowner whose living room walls were cracking, rather than a new
policy at the Department of Building and Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Kasindorf described Ward as "unfailingly ahead of his times,"
eager to people his newsrooms with women before it became fashionable
because he considered them more efficient and reliable than men.</TE>
<TE>   He loved Hollywood gossip, cold hot dogs and animal tales--owning
at the time four dogs, five cats, one horse and one goat, she said.
She described him as a terrifying taskmaster, courteous and caustic
with "a quick mind and incredible memory."</TE>
<TE>   Between Ward's failed first race for mayor and his election as
supervisor, he served as news director and anchorman at KHJ-TV
Channel 9. After he lost a bid for a third term in 1980, Ward
returned to broadcasting as a news commentator for another three
years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Ward is survived by his wife, Karen.</TE>

<HD>Enron, Argentina, Al Qaeda Temper Outlook at Forum</HD>
<DH>Economy: Most at international gathering concur that
sluggish times will last through this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM S. ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The protesters folded up their placards and drifted away from the
barricades Monday as the World Economic Forum concluded the final
sessions of its much-publicized five-day talkfest.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the heavily guarded Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where their
anti-globalization adversaries could not be seen, business leaders
remained far more preoccupied with an unanticipated triple threat:
Enron Corp., Argentina and Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   These very different sources of political and financial
uncertainty combined to cast a pall over the forum's 32nd annual
meeting, making participants unusually reluctant to make firm
predictions about the economic future.</LD>
<TE>   There was a rough consensus about underlying global and regional
trends: The world's leading economies will remain stubbornly sluggish
this year, most of the industrialists and finance ministers here
concurred. Economists here generally echoed the latest IMF
projections of barely 1% growth in the industrialized world in 2002,
a rate essentially unchanged from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The short-term outlook depends critically on the United States,"
said Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of Citigroup, reflecting an
almost universal view.
     But a bearish Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said bluntly</TE>
<TE>that he didn't see much more chance of a major upturn this
year in the U.S. than he did in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Henry M. Paulson Jr., chairman of Goldman Sachs, also said he
expected continued slow growth in the U.S., and the global economy
generally. "In our business, I see a tough year this year," he said
in one of the closing panel sessions Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, who until recently was deputy director of the
International Monetary Fund, forecast a modest "U-shaped recovery" in
the U.S., with an upswing late in the year.</TE>
<TE>   But Fischer added that many of his forum colleagues worry that the
growth pattern may look more like a W, with continuing volatility
driven by security fears and fallout from the Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "There is broad concern that the implications of the unfolding
Enron scandal could have a major impact on investor confidence,"
Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some corporate analysts said the spectacular disintegration of the
Houston-based energy trading company could trigger further
bankruptcies, as creditors subject balance sheets to more intense and
skeptical scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, Kmart was a victim of Enron," said Gail Fosler, chief
economist of the Conference Board, a research group funded by major
U.S. corporations. Others could follow, she said, despite assets and
incomes that would in other times ensure continued investor support.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's travails, while not immediately threatening to big
industrial economies or major banks, will jeopardize financial flows
to other emerging markets, economists and government officials
warned.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill indirectly agreed, making it
clear in several panel sessions that his staunch opposition to a new
bailout of Argentina stems from a much broader resistance to
financial assistance to developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last 50 years, hundreds of billions have been spent in
the name of economic development, with so many of the countries that
have been major recipients still not showing strong evidence of
positive change," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   With presumably deliberate hyperbole, he later disparaged what he
said was the waste of "trillions" in aid to developing countries.
     Argentines and other countries, he said, should not
expect American "plumbers and carpenters" to pay for their economic
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Trade experts said the Argentine crisis also could hamper the
quest for further free trade deals in the Western hemisphere and
beyond--trade pacts that many here consider essential to revitalizing
the world economy.</TE>
<TE>   And Argentina's own long-term recovery--like that of
many developing nations--could depend on the willingness of wealthy
nations to dismantle domestic agricultural protectionism.</TE>
<TE>   "Criticisms about how the markets of the north are closed are
totally correct," said Michael Moore, the head of the World Trade
Organization, which recently initiated a three-year round of global
trade talks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an injustice that has to be addressed. If it is not
addressed in this round, this round will not conclude."</TE>
<TE>   Japan, which has been mired in something close to recession for
nearly a decade, still appears unprepared to cut farm subsides and
purge billions in bad loans from its banking system, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the rest of us, it may not matter, suggested Jacob
Frenkel, the London-based president of Merrill Lynch International.</TE>
<TE>   "The world economy has already adjusted to the fact that Japan is
on the sidelines," Frenkel said.</TE>
<TE>   Developing nations are expected by the IMF to keep expanding this
year at close to 4%.</TE>
<TE>   But that encouraging growth was expected to come largely from
India and China, and analysts from both countries  said the two
giants may begin faltering in 2002. India has been shaken by regional
geopolitical tremors, they noted, while China, as a freshly minted
member of the World Trade Organization, faces the disruptive
challenge of preparing for import competition for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   With the World Trade Center still smoldering just three miles
south of the forum site, much of the discussion focused on real or
imagined fault lines between Islamic and Western culture and the
widening "digital divide" between advanced industrial societies and
the world's poor majority.</TE>
<TE>   But CEOs here also noted with concern their own mounting
costs from terrorism, with billions going to unanticipated security
measures and expensive new insurance requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Damage from the downturn in air travel, deeper and longer-lasting
than many had predicted, is rippling  beyond the airline and hotel
businesses to hurt many manufacturers and real estate projects,
analysts and chief executives  said.</TE>
<TE>   "People must create more flexible business models so they can
adjust to a more uncertain environment," said Kenneth I. Chenault,
chairman of American Express, which saw its earnings plunge by half
in last year's last quarter, due largely to the drop in business
travel.</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously absent from the gathering were executives
from Enron, which had its status as a forum sponsor unceremoniously
revoked shortly before the Waldorf--Astoria meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen consulting's chairman also canceled an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron was ubiquitously present in conversations on panels and
in the hotel's corridors in the  last five days.</TE>
<TE>   "To a large extent, the Enron scandal is to the world of economics
what Sept. 11 was to the world of geopolitics," said Dominique Moisi
of France's Institute of International Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "What is wrong with Enron is not how it fell, but how it
rose," said John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. "Enron economics is
not an aberration, it is an ideology."</TE>
<TE>   Even the Archbishop of Canterbury weighed in. "What is
happening to Enron at the present moment is a deep challenge to
capitalism," the Rev. George Carey said.</TE>
<TE>   Unsurprisingly, not all the capitalists here agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs' Paulson called Enron "a one-off event" and worried
that it would prompt "unnecessary regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Tyson, dean of the London Business School and a former
head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, also cautioned
against reading too much into the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't know enough about the Enron story to draw broader
conclusions about transparency and conflict-of-interest regulations
and accounting standards," she said. "I don't think there is any
evidence yet that it is systemic in nature."</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the short term, analysts and bankers here agreed, the Enron
collapse will make funding even tighter for the most vulnerable
companies, much as Argentina's troubles are choking off the flow of
loans to the most needy economies.</TE>
<TE>   "The haves will get credit, and the have-nots will not," said
Richard S. Fuld, chairman and chief executive of Lehman Bros.</TE>

<HD>Enron Report Could Bolster Criminal Case</HD>
<DH>Probe: Panel's allegations of financial subterfuge increase
likelihood of indictment, legal experts say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report claiming that Enron Corp. executives used partnerships to
enrich themselves and mask the company's troubled finances makes it
increasingly likely that prosecutors will bring criminal fraud
charges, legal experts said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released late Saturday by a special committee of Enron
board members, said the partnerships appeared in some cases to be
used for financial subterfuge rather than for legitimate business
purposes.</LD>
<LD>   If investigators can show that Enron officials intentionally
deceived investors, it would mark a significant new development in
the case, according to attorneys experienced in corporate fraud.</LD>
<TE>   Enron executives would have a stronger defense had the report
found that they simply made bad business decisions, attorneys said.
Instead, the report charged that the now-infamous partnerships at the
heart of Enron's collapse often served no "bona fide economic"
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "This report makes it more likely that there will be a criminal
indictment," said Christopher Bebel, a partner at Shepherd Smith &amp;
Bebel in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the government's going to have an easier time
establishing intent, because now we've learned additional details
about the efforts at concealment of the truth as the scheme was
unfolding," Bebel said. "And we're learning about the extent to which
members of top management profited."</TE>
<TE>   The report detailed a culture of corporate mismanagement and
inside dealing. It pointed the strongest criticism at Andrew S.
Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, saying that he and
several subordinates reaped tens of millions of dollars in profit at
the expense of the company and its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal authorities cautioned that it was not certain criminal
charges would  be brought.</TE>
<TE>   Though the report contains strident allegations, the three-member
panel acknowledged that it did not have the full picture. Some key
people refused to cooperate, and the panel lacked access to important
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Though the report appears to strengthen the government's hand in
bringing potential fraud charges, Enron executives still have a
variety of defenses available, some authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron executives could argue that the partnerships were created
and run with the full backing of lawyers and others upon whom they
relied for expert advice, said Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York defense
attorney who previously was at both the U.S. attorney's office in New
York and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin noted that as a defense, Enron executives could claim that
lawyers, accountants and others signed off on the deals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many experts said the report contains clearly damaging
information that lowers the hurdle to bringing a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, the difference between a civil case and a criminal one
is intent, attorneys said. Prosecutors would have to prove that a
defendant purposely broke the law as opposed to simply having acted
"recklessly."</TE>
<TE>   With Enron, prosecutors could argue that Fastow and others were
making millions while manipulating the company's books, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the evidence is as strong as this report seems to make it,
then I'd think it's a pretty strong case," said Paul Fishman, a New
York lawyer who handles white-collar crime cases.</TE>
<TE>   The report also hands the Justice Department extra ammunition with
which to pursue its case, Fishman and others said. One major strategy
in the investigation is to coax insiders to cooperate with
information about the wrongdoing of others.</TE>
<TE>   The report may convince some people that it's better to cooperate
before others do and they lose offers of leniency.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be enough in [the report] that it may scare the pants
off someone," Fishman said.</TE>
<TE>   If the allegations in the report bear out, the government could
charge fraud on several levels, said Brian O'Neill, a partner at
O'Neill, Lysaght &amp; Sun in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   If the company was shuffling its finances while borrowing money
from financial institutions, that could be bank fraud, he said. If it
used the mail or electronic means to deceive investors, that could be
mail or wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The headline-garnering nature of the Enron debacle could itself
increase the likelihood of criminal charges being brought, said Henry
Hu, a securities-law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</TE>
<TE>   "This case has so gripped the attention of the general public that
the failure to bring a criminal prosecution, if the facts warrant it,
could undermine confidence in the financial markets," Hu said. "The
message it would send is that [criminal wrongdoing] doesn't matter:
'Even in an egregious situation, we won't prosecute criminally.'"</TE>

<HD>Panel to Examine Global Crossing Allegations</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: Former executive has accused company of
masking financial problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure to defend its accounting methods, Global Crossing Ltd.
said Monday that a committee of independent directors will review a
former employee's allegations that the company used misleading
financial statements to mask its deteriorating condition.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based telecommunications company, which filed for
bankruptcy reorganization a week ago, also stepped up its attack on
the credibility of Roy Olofson, the former finance vice president who
wrote a letter Aug. 6 raising concerns about the company's
accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing said Olofson, through separate attorneys, twice
sought multimillion-dollar settlements in return for dropping plans
for a wrongful termination lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   Company executives, who are based in Beverly Hills, said they
refused to pay Olofson's original request, an annual compensation
package and a later demand for less than one-tenth the original
settlement figure.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, executives said their accounting practices are
sound, were fully disclosed, and added that "there were reasons to
question the motives" of Olofson.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lysaght, Olofson's attorney, called Global Crossing's
extortion accusations "silliness," saying that it is "responsible
litigation practice" to send a defendant company a draft copy of a
complaint, to invite it to negotiate a settlement and to propose a
starting number.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been expecting a carefully orchestrated smear campaign
against Mr. Olofson to be Global Crossing's first line of defense,"
Lysaght said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the question is whether Global Crossing's financial
statements are accurate or inaccurate, and this [statement] from
Global Crossing is designed to divert attention from that central
question," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives refused to disclose how many board members--and
which ones--are on the new special committee, or release further
details about its initial review of the accounting issues.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's developments were triggered last week after a letter
surfaced that Olofson wrote to Global Crossing executives in August,
outlining bookkeeping methods he viewed as misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's letter, first disclosed by the Los Angeles Times,
included detailed allegations involving long-term network capacity
contracts, and asked James Gorton, then Global Crossing's general
counsel, to investigate the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The use of such contracts is common between telecommunications
companies, but the way those contracts are accounted for has come
under fire from analysts and others, who believe that such deals
allow the companies to aggressively pump up revenue figures.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton referred the matter to Global Crossing's outside attorneys,
who concluded that Olofson's allegations were without merit.</TE>
<TE>   The company did not disclose the letter to its board of directors
audit committee or to its outside auditing firm, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Both entities, after receiving copies of Olofson's letter last
week, asked Global Crossing to conduct a new investigation of the
allegations, this time using an independent auditing committee,
independent attorneys and accountants other than Andersen.</TE>

<HD>Fresh Accounting Worries Knock Stock Market to Three-Month
Lows</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Concerns at Tyco and Enterasys drive S&amp;P down
2.5% and Nasdaq down 2.9%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks tumbled Monday, knocking key indexes to three-month lows, as
deepening concerns over accounting at conglomerate Tyco International
and fresh worries inspired by the continuing Enron debacle rattled
investors.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank 27.76 points, or 2.5%, to
1,094.44, its lowest close since Nov. 2, before the U.S. and its
allies had scored major victories in the war in Afghanistan. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slid 55.71 points, or 2.9%,
to 1,855.53, its lowest close since Nov. 12. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 220.17 points, or 2.2%, to 9,687.09, closing above the
recent low it hit Jan. 29.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a tremendous amount of fear infecting the whole market.
Nobody gets the benefit of the doubt anymore," said Rod Smyth, chief
investment strategist at First Union Securities.</LD>
<TE>   "Osama bin Laden tested our faith in security," Smyth said,
referring to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "Now Enron is testing
our faith in securities and the accounting profession."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco skidded $5.73 to $29.90 after saying it spent $8 billion in
three years on more than 700 undisclosed purchases. The stock is now
off 49% year to date as some investors have questioned the company's
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Enterasys Networks plummeted $6.60 to $4.20 after the
maker of computer network switches said late Friday that it was being
investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that its
fourth-quarter earnings results would be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Tech and telecom stocks led the Nasdaq's sell-off, with the Amex
telecom index down 5.2% and the Amex networking index off 8.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Other stocks taking a pounding included Irish pharmaceutical giant
Elan, whose U.S.-traded shares plunged $15.10 to $14.85 after the
company slashed its 2002 earnings forecast. Last week the stock was
rocked by questions about Elan's accounting involving various joint
ventures.</TE>
<TE>   From the S&amp;P 500's recent bottom Sept. 21 through the first week
of January, the blue-chip benchmark rallied 21%, spurring widespread
hopes for an end to the two-year bear market.</TE>
<TE>   But bears have regained control on Wall Street, sending the index
sliding about 7% in the last four weeks amid the Enron bankruptcy and
accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Smyth said investors in general are legitimately concerned about
the reliability of corporate accounting, but he said some stock
traders "may be overreacting." Smyth remains bullish for the market
in 2002, but warned that Enron's collapse and the accompanying
accounting worries could lead the market back to its post-Sept. 11
low point.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was active Monday, with losers swamping winners by more
than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by almost 3 to 1 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields eased as many investors fled stocks for government
debt, and the dollar fell against the euro and the Japanese yen amid
growing pessimism about an imminent economic turnaround in the U.S.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.90% from
Friday's close of 4.98%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Microsoft sank $1.54 to $61.12, a drag on all three major
indexes, after Chairman Bill Gates said Sunday that he doesn't expect
much pickup in the economy this year.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the tech sector, Ciena dropped $1.88 to $10.12 on a
downgrade from ABN Amro; Priceline.com skidded $1.49 to $4.83 after
warning that first-quarter profit could be disappointing because of
light travel sales; and Amazon.com fell $1.20 to $12.53 after a Wall
Street Journal article raised questions about the company's
liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   In telecom, Avaya dropped $1.14 to $6.76 after a debt downgrade
from Moody's Investors Services, while WorldCom fell $1.48 to $8.13.</TE>
<TE>   * General Electric dropped $1.85 to $35 as investors remained
nervous about any conglomerate with a complex accounting structure.</TE>
<TE>   * In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 159.50
points to 9,631.93. The Nikkei is trading below the level of the Dow
industrials for the first time since 1957.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks slumped amid concern about the chances for
recovery in the economy and the stock market this year. American
Express lost $1.68 to $33.42, and Merrill Lynch sagged $2.88 to
$47.12.</TE>
<TE>   * Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson lost $2.97 to $53.19 after
BusinessWeek said demand for the company's current model year
products has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks declined as January flight traffic remained
sluggish, according to results from some carriers. Continental
Airlines dropped $1.36 to $27.25; UAL, parent of United Airlines,
slipped 21 cents to $13.22; and Southwest Airlines dipped 20 cents to
$18.57.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold stocks were among the few bright spots. Newmont Mining
rallied $1.09 to $23.90 and Placer Dome added 56 cents to $13.20.</TE>

<HD>Global Letter by a 'Moral' Man</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy L. Olofson was an "old-economy" stalwart amid the bustling
salesmen and "new-economy" believers that built Global Crossing Ltd.
into one of the darlings of the technology revolution.</LD>
<LD>   The company was created around an ambitious plan to build a global
telecommunications network. Its chief executive, Gary Winnick,
proclaimed its technology plan "the future face of communications."</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, Olofson had spent nearly his entire career at such
traditional companies as Fedco, where he was CEO, and Carter Hawley
Hale Stores Inc., where he was vice president of finance.</LD>
<TE>   The marriage between the 63-year-old executive and Global Crossing
was an uncomfortable one--and it has now led to a messy divorce that
has opened up the inner workings of the troubled company.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson, who was fired in November, was the author of a letter
written to Global Crossing executives in August, raising concerns
about the company and its auditor, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The letter questioned Global Crossing's accounting practices
concerning certain long-term leases. Olofson wrote he was "very
disturbed" and "concerned that investors and commercial bankers may
have been intentionally misled."</TE>
<TE>   The letter--along with questions from analysts and investors after
the company's bankruptcy filing Jan. 28--has sparked an inquiry by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which has its
executive offices in Beverly Hills, call Olofson a litigious and
disgruntled extortionist who has been trying to elicit a
multimillion-dollar settlement from the company.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a situation we are very familiar with ... and is without
merit," the company said in a statement. "Mr. Olofson is a former
employee who is trying to draw parallels to the Enron situation for
his own personal gain."</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's attorneys insist he is a whistle-blower in the mold of
Sherron S. Watkins, the former Enron executive who wrote a letter to
former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay outlining the accounting
practices that ultimately brought down the company.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Moral Person' With 'High Standards'</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very straightforward, intelligent, moral person who has
been wrestling with these issues for a while," said Paul Murphy,
Olofson's attorney. "He's not doing this for the money."</TE>
<TE>   Olofson has refused to comment about his letter, but friends,
former co-workers and rivals describe him as a stubborn, but
principled businessman.</TE>
<TE>   "If Roy thinks something is wrong, he will do something about it
and won't let it go," said Brian Fleming, chief financial officer
with BCBG MaxAzria who worked with Olofson for more than a decade at
Carter Hawley Hale and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
when it was still known as Price Waterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "He has incredibly high standards," Fleming said. "If accounting
issues ever came up, he'd always insist that things got done
properly."</TE>
<TE>   Olofson, a former Marine who grew up in the village of Kenmore,
N.Y., graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration
and accounting from UCLA in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Retailing, Manufacturing</TE>
<TE>   Soon after graduating, he became a manager at Price Waterhouse,
where he specialized in audit and tax issues in the retailing and
manufacturing industries. He later left to join Carter Hawley Hale
and after more than a decade, moved over to the executive team at
Fedco. There he served as chief operating officer, chief financial
officer and eventually CEO.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Fedco overhauled its upper management team and laid off
Olofson, who filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the company
in Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson claimed he had a three-year employment contract with the
company. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum. Both sides
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, then a company with promising buzz, recruited
Olofson in 1997 to be vice president of finance. Over the next four
years, Olofson was responsible for processing all accounting
transactions, preparing the company's financial statements and
handling its SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson became concerned about the company's accounting practices
last year, according to his August letter.</TE>
<TE>   He had taken nearly three months off for medical leave in spring
2001 after being diagnosed with lung cancer. While gone, he kept
track of the company's various financial dealings, said his attorney
Brian C. Lysaght.</TE>
<TE>   What Olofson heard, and what he learned after he returned to
Global Crossing in May 2001, alarmed him enough to write his
five-page letter to James Gorton, the company's general counsel and
chief ethics officer, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton, who left Global Crossing about a month after receiving
Olofson's letter, said he provided copies of the letter to the
company's senior managers and hired an outside law firm to look into
the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton said he left the company because his contract had expired
and he wanted to move on--a decision he had disclosed to other Global
Crossing executives weeks before Olofson's letter arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "No one expressed any alarm about [the letter] at all," said
Gorton, now a consultant for Ridgestone Corp., a Los Angeles private
equity firm. "Global Crossing disclosed [the disputed contract
accounting] in their reports."</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's attorneys said the accountant was fired three months
after giving his letter to Gorton.</TE>
<TE>   Letter Disclosed Day After Bankruptcy Filing</TE>
<TE>   The contents of the letter came to light Jan. 29--one day after
Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing
debts of $12.3 billion and assets of $22.4 billion. It is the
fifth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The company denied Olofson's accusations. In a statement Monday,
the company said Olofson asked for a "multimillion-dollar payment and
a minimum seven-figure annual cash compensation package for a
five-year period" to abandon his wrongful termination claim.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it "terminated" Olofson in November as part of
companywide staff cuts. According to the company's statement Monday,
Olofson gradually reduced his demands to an amount "representing less
than one-tenth of the original."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's board of directors' audit committee has now
asked for an independent review of the allegations in Olofson's
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, Olofson's attorney, said Global Crossing's statements were
only to discredit his client. "He's not relishing this publicity, but
he's pressing forward because it's the right thing to do," Murphy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Elizabeth Douglass contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>James Blackwood, 82; Renowned Gospel Singer</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>James Blackwood, the last founding member of the Blackwood Brothers
Quartet and one of the giants of Southern gospel music, has died. He
was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwood died Sunday at Methodist Healthcare-Central Hospital in
Memphis of complications of a stroke. He had suffered from several
health problems the last few years, including colon cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The Blackwood Brothers recorded more than 200 albums, toured the
world, and helped form the Gospel Music Assn. in 1964. They were a
favorite of Elvis Presley, who sang briefly with James' nephew,
Cecil, in another quartet, the Songfellows.</LD>
<TE>   The Blackwood Brothers, under James Blackwood's leadership, ''made
an indelible impression upon millions worldwide,'' said Frank
Breeden, president of the gospel association. ''Whether through
television, radio or live performances, they set and maintained a
standard on relating to an audience that is still influencing
performers today.''</TE>
<TE>   The group was formed in 1934 by James, his brothers, Roy and
Doyle, and Roy's son, R.W. The family then lived in rural Choctaw
County, Miss., where James Blackwood was born.</TE>
<TE>   The group toured successfully until World War II, when it
temporarily disbanded. After the war, the Blackwoods regrouped,
moving to Memphis in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1954, the Blackwood Brothers Quartet appeared on ''Arthur
Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' on television and won the competition. But
two weeks later, R.W. and bass singer Bill Lyles died in a plane
crash in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   The surviving Blackwoods regrouped again, adding Cecil Blackwood
and J.D. Sumner. In 1970, James Blackwood retired because of health
problems and was replaced by his son, Jimmy.</TE>
<TE>   When his health improved, he would occasionally perform with the
group, and he founded two other quartets, Masters Five and the James
Blackwood Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackwood Brothers Quartet won eight Grammy Awards from 1966
to 1982, some for backup singing for country stars such as Barbara
Mandrell and Porter Wagoner. James Blackwood was named best male
vocalist by the gospel association seven times.</TE>
<TE>   He was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1974, then
again in 1998 as part of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwood is survived by his wife of 62 years, Miriam; sons, Jimmy
and Billy; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>B. Templeton, 95; Museum Botanist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonnie Templeton, a pioneering female botanist who served as curator
of botany for the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History from
1929 to 1970, has died. She was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Templeton, a Los Angeles resident, died of heart and kidney
failure Jan. 29 in a Glendale hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Templeton's botanical accomplishments ranged from discovering a
rare plant on the El Segundo sand dunes in the 1930s to assembling
botanical evidence from the La Brea Tar Pits in the 1960s that proved
that the climate of Southern California during the Pleistocene era
was much cooler and wetter than previously believed.</LD>
<TE>   She also endured years of discrimination in a male-dominated
field.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a trailblazer for women scientists at a time when there
were basically no women in science," said Stella Coakley, head of the
botany and plant pathology department at Oregon State University,
where Templeton received her doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Newman Grove, Neb., Oct. 23, 1906, Templeton moved to Los
Angeles alone at the age of 16. She stumbled into botany by chance.</TE>
<TE>   After a variety of jobs that included working as a waitress and a
secretary, she was sent by an employment agency to the home of a
hobbyist who needed help classifying and mounting specimens in his
extensive collection of dried plants.</TE>
<TE>   From what had simply been a means to pay the rent, Templeton found
a vocation.</TE>
<TE>   By 1928, she had learned enough about plants to become assistant
botanist at the California Botanic Garden in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, she was named curator of botany at the county Museum
of Natural History, where she remained for 41 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Her boss and others kind of hassled her because she didn't have
degrees," said Chester Weiche, Templeton's husband of 59 years.</TE>
<TE>   So, while continuing to work full time at the museum, Templeton
attended night classes at USC, where she earned her bachelor's degree
in botany in 1941 and her master's degree in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   She took a year's leave of absence and earned her doctorate in
1964, writing her thesis on the fruits and seeds of the Rancho La
Brea Pleistocene deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton's research, Times science writer George Getze wrote in
1964, painted a picture of a Los Angeles area in the Pleistocene era
as a well-watered meadowland, dotted with trees and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   Most paleontologists believed that the climate of Southern
California 15,000 years ago was just about as dry as it is now, if
not drier.</TE>
<TE>   But the scientific consensus was based on fossil remains of birds,
rodents and other animals today associated with dry grasslands.</TE>
<TE>   "Animal life is not in itself a reliable guide to climate,"
Templeton told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Animals migrate, and their remains may be those of individuals or
herds caught far from their natural habitat by some unseasonal change
in the weather."</TE>
<TE>   But plants, she said, don't move.</TE>
<TE>   They germinate, mature, go to seed and die in one place.</TE>
<TE>   However, diggers at the La Brea Tar Pits in the early 1900s had
carelessly thrown aside most of the plant material they found,
resulting in the loss of valuable evidence of what the climate was
like.</TE>
<TE>   But in what Getze characterized as a brilliant piece of scientific
sleuthing, Templeton found seeds, leaves, and other parts of plants
in the tar that was taken from inside the skulls of saber-tooth cats
that had been trapped in the tar pits.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence included seeds of many plants that no longer grow in
the area because it is too dry.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout her long career as a botanist, Templeton experienced
what she believed was a pattern of discrimination against women in
the sciences.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she recalled in a 1993 Times interview, the head of
the biology department at USC told her that no woman would get a
doctorate in botany as long as he had a say in it.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Templeton
said, officials often ordered books for her male colleagues but she
had to buy her own.</TE>
<TE>   And while most male department heads had assistants, her requests
for an assistant to help ease her workload were rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after I got my doctorate, it took a whole year before anyone
[at the museum] would call me doctor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton said she suffered the deepest wound early in her career
when she was unable to get official recognition for Pholisma
paniculatum, the rare plant she discovered on the El Segundo sand
dunes in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   The white-flowered plant, she believed, was significantly
different from another parasitic plant, the bright-pink flowered P.
arenarium, which is usually found in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton said she wrote an article about her discovery and showed
a copy of it to Philip Munz, a well-known botanist who was writing a
book on the flora of Southern California, but he refused to recognize
her find.</TE>
<TE>   That's still largely the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the books that describe the plants of Southern California
have generally not accepted it as a valid species, but it's not clear
that they are correct to do that," said Andrew C. Sanders, curator of
the herbarium at UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "The plant is poorly known," Sanders said. "Nobody has studied it
closely because nobody can find it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the unusual plant that Templeton discovered and named has
been elusive.</TE>
<TE>   But after seeming to have disappeared from the El Segundo sand
dunes amid years of beachfront construction, P. paniculatum made a
surprising comeback in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard they had found it, I almost cried over the
phone," Templeton said at the time. "It's like, if you lost a diamond
ring, and after all those years, finally it was there. To me, it's
that much of a treasure."</TE>
<TE>   While working as curator of botany at the county Museum of Natural
History, Templeton served as an on-call forensic botanist for the Los
Angeles Police Department, as well as being on call for the poison
center.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the museum in 1970, she founded the California
Botanical Science Service, a private consulting business in Glendale,
which she operated for about 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, Templeton is survived by a sister,
Matie Till of Corpus Christie, Texas.</TE>

<CX>   Templeton obituary--In the obituary of Bonnie Templeton on Feb. 5
in the California section, Templeton, the former curator of botany at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, was quoted as saying in
1993 that she had experienced discrimination against women in the
sciences during her career.</CX>
<CX>   While efforts to reach museum officials in advance of the obituary's
publication were unsuccessful, one of her former colleagues refuted some
of her points after the obituary appeared.</CX>
<CX>   William Emboden, senior curator of botany at the museum during
Templeton's tenure, said, "The Museum of Natural History did not
discriminate in hiring, promoting or providing staff with those things
necessary to their advancement. Bonnie was no exception. . . . We had
numerous distinguished women in all areas as our colleagues and we took
great pride in their achievements in both science and education."</CX>

<HD>Slight Rise in HUD Funding Expected for State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is expected to receive only a slight increase in its share
of the proposed fiscal year 2003 Housing and Urban Development budget
announced by HUD Secretary Mel Martinez on Monday. The total HUD
budget request of $31.5billion represents an increase of $2.1 billion
over the fiscal year 2002 budget.</LD>
<LD>   California is expected to get $274.9 million for the Home
Investment Partnerships program, an increase of $33.7 million over
the current funding. The program provides funds for the building,
buying and rehabilitation of affordable housing for rent or
homeownership. It also provides direct rental assistance to
low-income families.</LD>
<LD>   Under President Bush's proposed budget, California also would
receive about $593.3 million in Community Development Block Grant
funding, a slight increase over last year's budget. The block-grant
program funds economic development and housing.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed 2003 budget calls for an additional 34,000 Section 8
vouchers nationwide, an 89% increase over last year's allocation. The
federal program, which helps low-income families find affordable
rental housing, also permits California housing agencies to provide
mortgage assistance in lieu of a rental subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Housing Operating fund would receive an increase in
funding, as would the Habitat for Humanity program, which requires
low-income families to help construct the homes they will own.</TE>
<TE>   Although the HUD budget would provide a boost to local
initiatives, the funding falls short of what advocates say is needed
to ease California's housing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration once again has produced what is
essentially a flat-line budget for affordable housing," said Sheila
Crowley, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition,
which is calling for a $15-billion increase in federal housing
appropriations. "The president's housing budget is wholly
inadequate."</TE>

<HD>Hike in Workers' Comp Benefits Wins Approval</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Legislature on Monday approved a measure to
significantly increase workers' compensation in the state, which by
one estimate ranks second-to-last nationally in benefits paid to
injured workers.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis, who has vetoed similar measures three times in
recent years, is expected to sign the bill into law later this week.
That would bring to an end an election-year spat between the
Democratic governor and organized labor, one of his biggest financial
supporters.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, AB 749 by Assemblyman Tom Calderon (D-Montebello)
and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), would
gradually increase maximum weekly benefits from $490 to $840 by 2005.</LD>
<TE>   It would also double the death benefits for families of workers
killed on the job from $160,000 to $320,000, among other increases.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a widow and your husband died in Nevada, you are a lot
better off than if he died here," Burton told the Senate before the
vote. "If you want to lose a finger, move to Pennsylvania."</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed both houses with only Democratic support.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blasted the bill, saying a downturn in the economy is
no time to make life harder for business.</TE>
<TE>   It is expected to cost businesses more than $2 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill will ultimately cost California jobs," said Senate
Republican Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga).</TE>

<HD>Potential Burn Hazard Spurs Oven Recall</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach company is recalling about 2,460 Thermador gas
ranges because inadequate ventilation causes the oven door to get too
hot, exposing users to possible burns.</LD>
<LD>   The ranges, sold nationwide from March 1998 to November 2001, have
caused no injuries but are a "potential burn hazard," said Nychelle
Fleming of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced
the recall Monday.</LD>
<LD>   BSH Home Appliances Corp., which manufactures the 48-inch
stainless steel ranges in Tennessee, said it had received one report
of dangerously high temperatures because of the defect. The ranges,
which cost $5,540 to $6,370, feature a small and large oven side by
side.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers should stop using the small oven immediately, but the
large oven and range are safe, Fleming said. They should contact a
Thermador service center to arrange a free repair.</TE>
<TE>   Customers can call a toll-free number--(800) 735-4328--Monday
through Friday from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST for information.</TE>
<TE>   In May, BSH voluntarily recalled 2,300 Thermador combination
microwave ovens because the door failed to lock properly during
self-cleaning, creating a potential fire hazard. No injuries were
reported. The company corrected the problem, said Gary Ball,
Thermador brand manager for BSH.</TE>
<TE>   The company, a unit of BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgerate of Munich,
Germany, is based in Huntington Beach.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Posts $247-Million Loss</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Falling energy prices and the costs from the sale
of a stake in a chemical firm hurt revenue and net income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KENNETT</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental Petroleum Corp., an oil and natural gas producer and
chemical maker, said Monday it had a $247-million loss in the fourth
quarter after energy prices fell and it had costs from selling a
stake in a chemical company.</LD>
<LD>   The final loss was 66 cents a share, compared with net income of
$333 million, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 40% to
$2.38billion.</LD>
<LD>   Oil prices last quarter on the New York Mercantile Exchange
averaged 36% less than a year earlier, and gas fell 59% as the
recession and mild weather cut demand.</LD>
<TE>   The company produces gas in California, where the average price
plunged 81% after soaring in 2000 during an electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The tumble in crude prices had a tremendous impact," said Fadel
Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "They're also suffering from the longest and deepest downturn in
the chemical industry in history."</TE>
<TE>   Oil accounts for about 77% of Occidental's production, and gas the
rest, said Gheit, who rates the company's shares "hold" and doesn't
own any. Natural gas is used to fuel many new power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Los Angeles-based Occidental fell 66 cents to $25.52 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental had costs last quarter of $282 million. That includes
$240million for the planned sale of its 29.5% stake in chemical maker
Equistar, as well as expenses for environmental cleanup and idling a
Texas chemical plant, spokesman Kenneth Huffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Without those items, profit would have been $35 million, or 9
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental was expected to earn 10 cents a share, the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   During the quarter, earnings from oil and gas production fell 78%
to $166 million from $763 million.</TE>
<TE>   About $500 million of that decrease was due to lower prices for
the commodities, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Losses in Occidental's chemicals business narrowed to $4 million
from $51 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Lower chemical prices were partly offset by the reduced prices for
natural gas, oil and electricity, which are used as fuel and
feedstock in chemicals production, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   When chemical prices rebound, Occidental could earn $1.50 to $2 a
share annually from that business, Gheit said. Until then, it is
dependent on world oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential from an upside in chemicals is tremendous," he
said. "Unfortunately, the turnaround won't happen soon."</TE>

<HD>High Tech Still a Low Priority</HD>
<DH>E-commerce: A recent study shows that some small-business
and minority owners aren't aggressively using the Internet as a tool.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With customers queued up, phones ringing and employees needing
guidance on matters urgent, James Ogburn, owner of Little Jim &amp; Tim's
auto repair in Los Angeles, has hardly a nanosecond to discuss his
e-commerce strategy.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't think he has a Web site to promote his 15-year-old
business. His assistant corrects him. He does, sort of. It's part of
a larger automotive-services cybermall, on which it's nearly
impossible to find information about Little Jim &amp; Tim's.</LD>
<LD>   How about getting his own Web site? "We're still thinking about
it," Ogburn said, noting that such matters would have to wait,
because more pressing upgrades are needed around the shop.</LD>
<TE>   While American small business has been struggling to keep the
doors open during the economic recession, the rapid development of
electronic commerce has raised the stakes for companies such as
Ogburn's that remain ambivalent about investing in technology.</TE>
<TE>   Many large corporations and federal and local governments are
aggressively using the Web to conduct transactions and advertise
procurement opportunities. Even food stamps are going high tech.
California is set to replace the standard paper food vouchers with
debit-like cards over the next two years. That means big changes for
mom-and-pop shops that do not yet accept ATM or credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners slow to invest in e-commerce technology are being
advised to purchase now or possibly perish from the new
cyber-marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "As more people get connected, the digital divide is worse for the
people who are not connected," said Rachel Anderson, managing editor
of the Digital Divide Network at the Washington-based Benton
Foundation, which provides information on telecommunications issues.
"Because all sorts of civic, commercial and cultural information and
resources are finding a new home in that world, the virtual world."</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that minority-owned and small businesses are
investing in technology, but not at the same rate as nonminority
firms, and they're slow to shell out additional dollars for upgrades.
They often do not use the technology to its full extent.</TE>
<TE>   A study presented Saturday at a technology conference showed that
although 85% of African American small-business owners surveyed used
the Internet regularly, less than 2% planned to use the Internet as
an integral business tool, such as for e-commerce transactions or
data management.</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos surveyed, 6% said they expect to use the Internet
for business, compared with 35% among whites, according to the
Merrill Research study commissioned by Microsoft Corp. that surveyed
250 black and Latino small businesses about their use of technology.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed that only 7% of African American and Latino
small-business owners upgrade hardware or software annually. That
represents a big potential market for firms such as Microsoft and
Hewlett-Packard Co. The companies were the largest sponsors of the
Blacks in Technology Expo held over the weekend at the Los Angeles
Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   Some minority-business experts said the apparent digital divide
between minority and white businesses is caused not by lack of
computer ownership or access but by ambivalence about using
technology in more sophisticated ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Businesses have had no problem with lack of accessibility," said
Charles DeBow, director of special projects for the Washington-based
National Black Chamber of Commerce. "Many did own computers and had
Internet access, but they were used primarily for e-mail or by the
kids for entertainment purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Even as recently as two years ago, "there was a void of vehicles
acting as a catalyst to draw large numbers of small and minority
businesses online and participating in e-commerce," DeBow said.
"There needed to be a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Today, small-business experts say, the list of reasons grows
daily.</TE>
<TE>   DeBow noted that Internet-savvy business owners can join online
with other small-business owners for aggregate buying, which can
reduce the cost of goods.</TE>
<TE>   And the Commerce Business Daily--a newsletter used by businesses
to track government procurement opportunities over $25,000--has been
replaced by a Web site, www.fedbizopps.gov, said Henry T. Wilfong
Jr., president of the National Assn. of Small Disadvantaged
Businesses, and officials with the Commerce Department.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a presumption that most of us could switch over to
[the] Web," said Wilfong, who questions the accuracy of studies that
show high rates of regular Net access for minority-owned firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Our interaction with our membership, which is fairly
sophisticated, does not show such high usage," said Wilfong, whose
group includes about 300 members, mostly African American business
owners in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the mom-and-pop grocer, which will be inducted into the
digital revolution this summer.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the state will launch the Electronic Benefit Transfer
Project, which will do away with paper food stamps and transfer
benefits to a debit card. The 5,500 active businesses that accept
food stamps in Los Angeles County will join the roll-out in February
2003, with the final counties joining in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses that don't already process credit and debit cards will
be required to buy equipment to handle the new food-stamp card or
resort to processing transactions by hand, according to the state
Department of Social Services.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Lee, associate vice president of Dickerson Employee Benefits
in Los Angeles, one of the largest African American-owned insurance
brokerages in the nation, is willing to upgrade his computer systems
because he believes it will be good for the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   His firm will launch a program that's part of a $200,000 upgrade
to allow its 5,000 independent insurance brokers to go online and
receive quotes on employee-benefit packages.</TE>
<TE>   "When we launch the Web site with the online quoting, it should
generate a lot more business for us," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   But for most small firms on tight budgets, making a substantial
investment in technology upgrades is not an easy call.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a slam-dunk," said Tony Hatter, an account manager for
Marsh Communications Services Inc. in Los Angeles. His company spent
about $35,000 on upgrading its computer system, database and
3-year-old Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "There was definitely a discussion about why would we want to
spend this kind of money," Hatter said. Ultimately, he said, the cash
outlay was deemed necessary to "bring us toward the new millennium,
so we can compete with other companies."</TE>

<HD>Western Growers Names Thomas Nassif as CEO</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to raise its profile on trade issues, produce industry
group Western Growers Assn. named a former U.S. ambassador, Thomas
Nassif, as its new president and chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Western Growers lobbies on behalf of its 3,500 fruit,
vegetable and nut growers and shippers in California and Arizona, who
are responsible for about half the nation's fresh produce supply.</LD>
<LD>   By electing Nassif, a former ambassador to Morocco during the
Reagan administration and former chief of protocol under President
Reagan, the WGA's members believe they can have more influence on
federal trade policy as they seek to expand markets for their goods
around the world and protect the interests of farmers in state
legislatures.</LD>
<TE>   "Tom seems to have a wealth of information and experience
regarding how to work the political side of our business. He's adept
at handling both sides of the aisle, and he's a shrewd negotiator,"
said WGA vice chairman and broccoli shipper John D'Arrigo of D'Arrigo
Bros. in Salinas, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Since returning from Morocco, Nassif has served as chairman of
pipeline engineering company Gulf Interstate Engineering. He also was
president of real estate developer Los Alamos Land Co. and partner in
an international business and political consulting company.</TE>
<TE>   Nassif, who will be based in Irvine, succeeds David Moore, who
died last summer.</TE>

<HD>Waiting for His Day in Court Since '98</HD>
<DH>Justice: Drug trial of Mexican Mafia suspect has been
delayed time and again. He fired his first four attorneys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he sits in Orange County Jail awaiting trial on charges of
transporting cocaine, it is apparent that Art Romo is a long way from
his days as the broker of a peace agreement among gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Romo and two other men have been locked up since March 1998.
Attorneys in the case say the three will finally be tried next
month--maybe.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second time Romo has found himself on the wrong side of
the law since he organized the United Gang Council of Orange County
and brokered a much-publicized gang peace treaty in 1992. The first
time earned him a three-year sentence for laundering $60,000 for a
Colombian drug cartel. This time, Romo, 39, is facing 30 years or
more in prison if he is convicted of transporting more than 200 kilos
of cocaine, allegedly for the Colombians again.</LD>
<TE>   Although he is being tried with co-defendants Fernando Melendrez
and David R. Gomez, authorities believe that Romo, a Santa Ana
resident who owned a silk-screening business, is the ringleader and a
local leader of the Mexican Mafia prison gang, said Orange County
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Ferguson. Romo's bail is set at $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, who has been putting together the prosecution's case for
almost four years with another prosecutor, said he does not know of
another drug case in which defendants have been held this long before
going to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they have strong circumstantial evidence against
Romo; his lawyers contend that he will be freed after a jury hears
the facts.</TE>
<TE>   The complexity of the case and the multiple defendants who have
filed separate legal motions have contributed to delays. One
defendant's attorney died, leading to more delays while his
replacement familiarized himself with the case.</TE>
<TE>   But Romo has also stretched out the inevitable trial date by
hiring and firing defense attorneys. Each new attorney begins a new
investigation and needs time to learn the facts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Brooks, head of the Institute of Criminal Defense Advocacy
at California Western School of Law in San Diego, said state law
allows Romo to change attorneys as long as the trial judge permits
it.</TE>
<TE>   "If the judge is tolerant and thinks the issues raised by the
defendant are legitimate, the trial can be delayed for years while he
changes attorneys," Brooks said. "California has very strict rules on
a defendant's right to choose his own counsel. Courts are afraid of
running the risk of having a case reversed because a guy wasn't
allowed to choose his own counsel."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high for each man. Gomez, like Romo, is facing 30
years or more in prison if convicted, Ferguson said. Melendrez would
earn a third strike and life in prison, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions about Romo's alleged ties with the Mexican Mafia have
lingered since he engineered the 1992 peace treaty in Santa Ana. At
the time, skeptical police officials were quoted as saying the accord
was dictated by the Mexican Mafia because its drug sale profits were
slipping while street gang members, who moved the narcotics, were
busy shooting each other.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives have formed an ad hoc defense committee
since Romo's arrest. From his jail cell, Romo sends out written
messages advocating the "Barrio Peace Initiative" and an end to gang
violence. "What this boils down to is that I'm locked up and the
violence is continuing on the streets. Nobody's out there working to
stop the drive-by shootings," Romo said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He also recently issued a handwritten, 12-page statement
complaining that his attorneys "have all tried to help the government
railroad me in some kinda way." He is now on his fifth attorney,
having fired the others.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that some of these attorneys like to play golf with
the district attorneys on weekends, but please don't tell me that I'm
picking all the losers," Romo wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In October, he retained well-known criminal defense attorney Gary
Pohlson. In an interview from jail last week, Romo proclaimed his
innocence and said that he was happy with Pohlson "right now."</TE>
<TE>   Pohlson said he was disappointed by Romo's "unfortunate comments"
about his previous attorneys. "I'm doing an aggressive defense of my
client," Pohlson said. "This includes hiring another attorney who is
researching the case and filing motions on his behalf to show his
rights were violated." The prosecution's case starts with 276 kilos
of cocaine found in vehicles driven by Melendrez and Gomez. After
that discovery, court records state, a Santa Ana police dog alerted
officers to the presence of drugs on the exterior of a rear door in
Romo's SUV. Narcotics were never found in Romo's vehicle, but records
show that 19 bottles of inositol were recovered. Inositol is used to
dilute cocaine to increase its volume and maximize profits.</TE>
<TE>   In the jailhouse interview, Romo denied any ties to the cocaine
seizure, but he refused to discuss the inositol found in his vehicle.
He and the others are accused of transporting and selling cocaine as
members of a street gang. But the reality, law enforcement sources
say, is that the three ended up as discarded remnants of a federal
investigation that had bigger targets.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a task force of federal and local narcotics officers in
Los Angeles was investigating a Southern California drug ring,
prosecutor Ferguson said. During the surveillance of ring members,
agents tripped across Romo, Melendrez and Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   On March 8, 1998, task force members had Gomez's Fountain Valley
house under surveillance, having been led there by suspects they were
watching in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Melendrez and Romo stopped at the home
that day. Romo said he was simply visiting Gomez. Fountain Valley
officers were drafted to assist the task force and stopped
Melendrez's and Gomez's vehicles and found the cocaine inside,
records show. Romo was stopped later in the day by Santa Ana
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Los Angeles narcotics agents requested that
local police find a reason to do traffic stops of the suspects'
vehicles. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Martinez said
in an affidavit that he "requested uniformed police officers from
Fountain Valley conduct a traffic stop" of Gomez's vehicle. The same
request was made of Santa Ana police to stop Romo's SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Al Stokke, Melendrez's attorney, did not return telephone calls to
his office. Gomez's attorney, Shirley MacDonald, declined to comment.
But attorney Richard Schwartzberg, who is assisting Pohlson and wrote
a legal motion on Romo's behalf, said that the police stop of Romo
was done without probable cause and was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson acknowledged that the evidence against Romo is
circumstantial. "Circumstantial evidence carries the same weight as
direct evidence if the jurors are satisfied the circumstances are
true. It's a strong case," he said.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed in Shootout With Ontario Police After Traffic Stop</HD>
<DH>Crime: The driver died in a cross-fire between an officer
and the passenger, who fled and was shot in front of an apartment
complex. Both had criminal backgrounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE MADDAUS and JOANNA CORMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two suspects died in a shootout with police in Ontario that began
with a routine traffic stop by a rookie officer, detectives said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Det. Mike Macias gave the following account of Sunday's shootout:</LD>
<LD>   As soon as the suspects' car came to a halt, passenger Carlos Omar
Meza, 23, got out and aimed a sawed-off, 12-gauge shotgun at the
officer, who was armed with a pistol. Both men opened fire, and the
36-year-old driver was slain in the cross-fire.</LD>
<TE>   Then, as the 23-year-old officer continued firing, Meza jumped
into the officer's patrol car and drove off, straight into the path
of another police car.</TE>
<TE>   The backup officer said, "Oh my God, that's not a cop."</TE>
<TE>   The officer, a 40-year-old veteran, fired at Meza, who lost
control of the car and crashed a few blocks away. The suspect then
grabbed the police shotgun from the car and fled on foot.</TE>
<TE>   A third Ontario patrolman spotted Meza in front of an apartment
complex. When the suspect pointed his shotgun at the officer, the
officer opened fire, killing Meza, Macias said.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of the three Ontario officers have not been
released.</TE>
<TE>   The gun battle led down a block where a group of children were
taking part in a birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a whole bunch of shots and I thought they were
firecrackers," said 13-year-old Jerry Garcia. "I heard a policeman
screaming. I heard gunshots. I got scared, so I just went home."</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Ochoa, 11, showed where a bullet dented the top of his
father's van. Bullets also splintered a door in the apartment
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics tried to revive Meza, but he died at Doctors' Hospital
in Montclair at 6 p.m. Sunday, San Bernardino County coroner's
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, whose identity has not been released, died at
Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton about two hours after the
shootout.</TE>
<TE>   The driver was shot in the head, but police do not know whether
the fatal round came from Meza's shotgun or from the officer's
semiautomatic handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Both suspects had criminal backgrounds, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Meza, a resident of Pomona, pleaded guilty on Sept. 24, 1998, to a
charge of making terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   A charge of assault with a deadly weapon was dropped, according to
court officials. He was sentenced to probation, and given a suspended
three year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, 2001, Meza admitted violating his probation and was
sent to state prison. He was paroled on Sept. 13, then rearrested on
Oct. 27 for violating his parole. He was released again on Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   His criminal history goes back to 1993. He has been convicted of
felony charges for possession of a firearm and unlawful sex with a
minor, Macias said. He also was arrested on suspicion of beating a
child, but the case was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the driver's record were not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Teen Accused in Scam Misses SEC Deadline for Documents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. securities regulators said Monday that the Mission Viejo
teenager accused of running an elaborate Internet scam missed a
Monday deadline in which he had agreed to provide a complete
accounting of his operation.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission last month alleged that
Cole Bartiromo, 17, bilked investors worldwide out of more than $1
million through the "Invest Better 2001" Web site. In a partial
settlement of the SEC's civil securities fraud complaint, Bartiromo,
without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to turn over about
$900,000 that had been transferred to an account at an overseas
casino and provide a list of all bank accounts by Monday.</LD>
<LD>   SEC officials said Bartiromo had not submitted any of the required
documents to the federal agency by 9 p.m. EST. Alexander Vasilescu,
an SEC attorney in New York, also said no paperwork seeking an
extension of the deadline had been filed on Bartiromo's behalf.</LD>
<TE>   SEC officials declined to say what consequences the Trabuco Hills
High School senior faced because of the lapsed deadline. Vasilescu
said the accounting is necessary to determine two issues: what type
of civil penalty awaits Bartiromo and the total funds he will have to
disgorge as the SEC probe continues. Bartiromo has handed over more
than $1 million he had deposited in a Costa Rica casino account,
according to investigators. The SEC has not named any other defendant
in the case, although in its complaint the agency listed 10 "John
Doe's" along with Bartiromo.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the SEC alleged that Bartiromo's scheme operated
between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15 and involved claims of sure-fire bets on
sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   "A truthful accounting would help assess the total amount of
ill-gotten gains," Vasilescu said. "And as of now, we are not
convinced we have the total assets acquired by Invest Better 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney, David Bayless of San Francisco, could not be
reached. Calls to Bartiromo's home were not returned.</TE>

<HD>Friends Unaware of Director's Heart Problem</HD>
<DH>Death: After coroner finds cocaine in Ted Demme's system,
acquaintances say they didn't know the severity of his condition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Friends of director Ted Demme, who was found to have small traces of
cocaine in his system at the time of his death, said they were aware
he occasionally used the drug but that they did not know his heart
condition was so delicate.</LD>
<LD>   The official cause of Demme's death, announced over the weekend by
the Los Angeles County medical examiner, was a heart attack, with
coronary artery disease listed as a contributing factor. The
metabolized cocaine could have played a part in bringing on the heart
attack, the medical examiner said.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old director had thickened heart arteries and died
when a blood clot formed in a heart vessel, the coroner said.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a history of him having problems with his
heart--hypertension and high blood pressure," said Scott Carrier, a
spokesman for the medical examiner. "The use of the cocaine is a
contributing factor."</TE>
<TE>   But some of his friends said the director may not have realized
how serious his heart condition was. "He clearly didn't know he had a
heart problem; otherwise I know he would not have done that," said
one friend who asked to remain anonymous. "I know that he was a guy
who liked to party, but not any more than lots of other people who do
cocaine and every other drug and are still alive and kicking."</TE>
<TE>   Demme, father of a 2-month-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, was
pronounced dead Jan. 13 at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center after
paramedics rushed him to the facility in full cardiac arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Demme, the nephew of director Jonathan Demme, was playing in an
NBA Entertainment League game at Crossroads School in Santa Monica at
the time of the attack. He collapsed shortly after leaving the court
and sitting down on the bench, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Acquaintances said they were not aware Demme had a history of
heart or health problems and that he played basketball with friends
as often as five times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese said he was not aware that Demme
used drugs and regretted the fact that his autopsy report could
tarnish his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   He was, LaGravenese said, "a wonderful father and partner and
friend." Being a cocaine user "is the last thing in my mind I would
ever refer to him as. I wouldn't even think of referring to him as
that. It's kind of hurtful."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Demme's last movie was "Blow," the story of George
Jung, a small-town kid from New England who became Colombian drug
lord Pablo Escobar's right-hand man in the United States during the
1970s. The film starred Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   But LaGravenese said Demme was attracted to Jung's story because
of its tragedy, not the cocaine use or fast lifestyle. "'Blow' was a
about a guy caught in the wrong path who loses his daughter, the
thing he loves most," LaGravenese said. "That was what appealed to
him. It wasn't about the drugs or how great drugs are."</TE>
<TE>   The bearded, outgoing Demme worked in the entertainment industry
for more than a decade, both as a producer and director. Much of his
best-known work, including episodes of "Homicide: Life on the Street"
and the films "Blow," "Monument Ave." and "The Ref" combined gritty,
urban stories with offbeat, sharp-edged humor.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Demme was working on pilot programs for
two networks, and he was seen as a promising film director. His
gregarious personality also made him a fixture in some of Hollywood's
most famous hangouts.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Tana's restaurant renamed a popular dish in the director's
honor a day after his death. The Chicken Parmigiana Ted Demme, a
breaded, deep-fried breast of chicken smothered in mozzarella and
marinara sauce, was the director's favorite item on the menu,
assistant manager Nada Palikovic said.</TE>
<TE>   Palikovic said Demme came to the restaurant two or three times a
week and nearly always ordered that dish. "He was a steady customer,"
she said.</TE>

<TE>   Lying on a mattress inside her unit, Plunkett could spend hour
after hour watching videos with her cat, Bambi.</TE>
<TE>   If she was hungry, all she had to do was open the refrigerator. To
warm herself she turned on the heater. There was a portable toilet.
And calling friends was simply a matter of dialing: There was a phone
line in the unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing how stable she was, considering the way she
lived," said Bonnie Parral, a friend from church. "How settled in she
was. She had it all down pat."</TE>
<TE>   Now Plunkett, an eccentric 55-year-old, is missing, and the
low-cost haven she rented for herself and her possessions is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Her residency at the facility ended suddenly in December with a
fire that exposed her clandestine domicile and left friends and
family wondering what they might have done to help her find a real
home.</TE>
<TE>   "How could we have let her live there?" asked friend Bonita Pace.
"We all think that, but we couldn't stop her." Management at the
storage facility declined to discuss Plunkett.</TE>
<TE>   That she managed to live in such a place for so long, however, is
a testament to her will and her anguish.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett is a slender, red-headed woman who, according to some
family and friends, displays signs of manic depression, also known as
bipolar disorder.</TE>
<TE>   One day she is grubby and dirty, the next she is wonderfully
coiffed, hair dyed and nails manicured.</TE>
<TE>   One day she is delightful and full of energy, the next she is
erratic and angry with God. She loved going to church and singing
praise songs. She also enjoyed a road trip to casinos at the state
line and in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployed and on Social Security, according to friends, she is a
wiz with electronics and dreamed of converting a huge stash of videos
into her own rental store.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett is a familiar face to some in the neighborhood
surrounding the facility, although only her friends and family seemed
to know the effort it took for her to make her home work.</TE>
<TE>   For every problem at the unit, she found a solution.</TE>
<TE>   "She would work sometimes hours straightening things around just
the way she liked it," said her father, Don Plunkett.</TE>
<TE>   When she had money, she purchased a membership at a gym and
showered there. To get around the storage facility's gate hours, she
entered from the alley and found a way to squeeze into her unit
through an electrical cabinet, without opening the roll-up door,
friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the address of the rental facility appears on her
driver's license and on her car registration, Plunkett tried hard to
hide where she lived from most people.</TE>
<TE>   She'd say, "Don't tell anybody," Pace recalled. Pace always
quipped: " 'Gloria, you're the only one who doesn't know you live
here.' Everybody knew."</TE>
<TE>   And everybody wanted her to move. Her father would not set foot in
the place.</TE>
<TE>   Some things could be compensated for, like the lack of windows and
exits. But friends who visited briefly wanted her to get rid of the
mice and warned of the dangers of space heaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she would have liked to have [moved], except she couldn't
get rid of her stuff," Parral said. "She couldn't pay for the storage
unit and live in another place too."</TE>
<TE>   Gloria's large unit--for which her father speculated she paid
about $260 a month --was packed with all the things she could never
throw away, years of treasures pulled from trash bins. What she
couldn't donate to charities, she simply saved. Wooden shipping
pallets she sold to nearby businesses.</TE>
<TE>   With so much inside the unit, no one could see the living space
tucked behind, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   She cut a pathway that led to the center of the room--a few feet
of clear space. There, she placed the amenities of home. The mattress
was positioned in a loft, high above her collection.</TE>
<TE>   Moving would probably have meant getting rid of her beloved
things, and her many cats. Instead, she rented a second unit at
Anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd offered her a free apartment with a provision she couldn't
have any cats around. And she wouldn't agree to that," her father
said.</TE>
<TE>   By December, things finally seemed to be looking up for Plunkett.
Friends and family heard her making plans for a life on the
surface--maybe a home in Barstow. Some even thought she'd found a
boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Years of membership at Emmanuel Reform Church in Paramount seemed
to be helping her psychological state too. Pace had even found her a
counselor, who visited her at the storage unit.</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of Dec. 11, Gloria and her father had dinner. Then
he dropped her off at the storage facility at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 a.m., fire broke out in an electrical panel at the
facility and quickly spread to Gloria's unit and two others. In
minutes, years of collecting and organizing turned to ash.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze caused $40,000 worth of damage to the structure and
$11,000 to contents, county fire officials said. They determined that
the fire was accidental.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Plunkett was nowhere to be found. Nor did firefighters
find a body.</TE>
<TE>   About five days later, facility management notified her father,
who had not heard from Gloria. By then, what little was left of
Gloria's place had been cleared away, leaving him and everyone else a
slew of questions.</TE>
<TE>   If she survived the fire, where is she? Why would she leave behind
her car and Bambi, her favorite cat?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like her at all," her father said. "She got out of there
some way and disappeared. Didn't take her car, didn't call anybody."</TE>
<TE>   People turn up missing every day. They sometimes walk away from
their lives, shedding them to become other people in other places.
Other times, they end up victims.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, there's no evidence of foul play, said Sheriff's
Det. Diane Harris. No money has been withdrawn from Plunkett's
account since the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "She just kind of dropped off the face of the Earth," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Lefevre, who works in the area, said she remembered seeing
Plunkett at a market, days after the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Lefevre looked at her and thought, "That's the pallet lady. I
wonder what she's doing way over here in Lakewood?"</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that report, there have been no sightings. And in the
absence of any evidence, there is only speculation. Maybe Gloria was
kidnapped. Maybe she is somewhere in the city, lost even to herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes an incident can cause someone to go over the edge,"
Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   The family is offering a $10,000 reward through the Sheriff's
Department for information leading to Gloria's location. The missing
person flier includes a photograph of her.</TE>

<HD>Computer Hacker Sentenced to 21 Months</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A computer hacker from Mission Viejo was sentenced to 21 months in
federal prison Monday for breaking into high-security systems at NASA
and several universities and for using stolen credit card numbers to
obtain money and merchandise over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allen Diekman, 21, hacked his way into some systems while
out on bail after his first wave of computer break-ins.</LD>
<LD>   "I really apologize," Diekman told U.S. District Judge Dean
Pregerson as he appeared for sentencing in Los Angeles federal court.
Pregerson ordered the defendant to pay nearly $88,000 in restitution.
Diekman promised to return to college when he gets out of prison and
"do something productive with my life."</LD>
<TE>   For three years after his release, Diekman will be barred from
using a computer without the consent of his federal probation
officer.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced in three separate computer hacking cases.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, he pleaded guilty to hacking into government
computers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena and NASA
computers at Stanford University. The intrusions caused $17,000 in
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Using the names "Shadow Knight" and "Dark Lord," Diekman gained
root-level access to JPL computers, giving him control over all
aspects of the computer systems, including the ability to modify
files and alter security settings, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Arif
Alikhan, head of the prosecutor's computer crimes section.</TE>
<TE>   During the investigation into the NASA case, Diekman admitted that
he had hacked into "hundreds, maybe thousands" of computers,
including systems at Harvard, Cornell, UCLA, UC San Diego and Cal
State Fullerton, Alikhan said. He also stole credit card numbers,
using them to acquire more than $6,000 worth of electronics gear.</TE>
<TE>   While free on bond after pleading guilty in the first case,
Alikhan said, Diekman used his home computer to gain unauthorized
access 33 times last year to computers at Oregon State University.</TE>
<TE>   During that same period, Diekman again used stolen credit card
numbers. This time, he arranged to have money wired to him through
Western Union. One transfer was interrupted by Western Union before
it reached Diekman, and the other two were not authorized by the
issuing credit card companies, Alikhan said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Diekman was caught in the Western Union fraud
by investigators from AT&amp;T. Diekman later admitted stealing more than
8,000 minutes of service from the long-distance provider. While
investigating their loss, AT&amp;T security personnel recorded Diekman
discussing details of the Western Union scheme with acquaintances and
turned the tapes over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The young computer whiz was rearrested in April and has been held
without bail since then.</TE>
<TE>   In the third case, Diekman pleaded guilty in September to charges
of hacking into the computer system of Bay Area Internet Solutions
Inc. of San Jose, where he caused more than $50,000 in damage,
Alikhan said.</TE>

<HD>Bus Driver Hurt by Rock; 3 Boys Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three boys are scheduled to appear in Long Beach Juvenile Court next
month for allegedly throwing a bowling ball-size rock off a freeway
overpass Sunday and injuring an MTA bus driver, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The boys, ages 8, 9 and 14, were taken into custody Sunday night,
minutes after allegedly throwing the 10-pound rock off the Wardlow
Road overpass of the Long Beach Freeway in the Bixby Knolls area of
Long Beach. They were released to their parents after the parents and
boys were issued citations to appear in family court.</LD>
<LD>   The rock hit the bus driver, whose name was not released, in the
shoulder. He also was cut by shattered window glass. He was treated
at Long Beach Memorial Hospital and released.</LD>
<TE>   Officers had stepped up patrols in the vicinity of the Wardlow
Road overpass after complaints that objects were being thrown at
vehicles, said Officer Joseph Pace.</TE>
<TE>   The three boys were observed on Sunday wiping rock debris off
their hands, Pace said. He said officers think the boys may have been
involved in other similar incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think they weren't trying to hurt someone, but it
seems like they've been doing this the past few nights," Pace said.</TE>
<TE>   "These rocks could've killed someone. That bus driver was very
lucky."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has not decided what charges to
file against the juveniles.</TE>

<HD>Elementary School's Sights Set on Science</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years after a now-retired South Los Angeles state senator pushed
through the necessary legislation, a science-focused neighborhood
elementary school is taking shape in Exposition Park.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in the fall of 2004, 850 students, mostly from the
neighborhood, will begin attending the charter school, a result of a
partnership of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
California Science Center, USC, and other public and private
entities.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the charter school, serving kindergarten through
fifth grade, the partnership will build a Center for Science Learning
at the site to train thousands of teachers.</LD>
<TE>   Both the $24.3-million Science Center School and the $27.7-million
learning center will be in and around a converted Armory Building
just east of the Rose Garden and across Exposition Boulevard from
USC.</TE>
<TE>   The author of the original plan was then-state Sen. Teresa Hughes
(D-Inglewood). But by the time everything came together, it fell to
Gov. Gray Davis, a month shy of the March 5 gubernatorial primary, to
preside over a ceremony Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The event, marking the school's creation, drew an array of other
speakers, including Los Angeles district Supt. Roy Romer, Executive
Director Jeffrey Rudolph of the California Science Center (formerly
called the Museum of Science and Industry), Rep. Diane Watson (D-Los
Angeles) and Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   The new school will not be a magnet school, but instead "a model
school ... that will focus on math and science and integrate language
arts, social studies and fine arts in the curriculum," Rudolph
said--mostly for students who live in the neighborhood, though some
outsiders may be admitted as well. Admission criteria have not been
settled.</TE>
<TE>   The school will include 28 classrooms, six common rooms, with
spaces and equipment for group projects within a classroom or between
classrooms. Four classrooms will connect to each common room.</TE>
<TE>   Students will learn to develop and test ideas as they create their
own exhibits, some of which will be displayed in the Science Center.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a multipurpose room for use as a cafeteria and
auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Science Learning will include 10 thematically
designed classrooms and two laboratory spaces. The classrooms will be
used for teacher training, workshops for children, parent-child
classes and community programs.</TE>
<TE>   There also will be a professional development library for
educators, a video production studio and a Science Garden, a
sheltered space with exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in the ceremony's keynote speech, said he expected the
school and learning center to "provide as good an educational
experience as you can get anywhere in America."</TE>
<TE>   Rudolph said the construction financing is coming mainly from a
Federal Emergency Management Agency grant, state funds and education
bonds approved by the voters.</TE>

<HD>Hewlett-Packard Says Results Exceed Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The company says demand for printers and
computers rose in its fiscal first quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co., battling for shareholder approval to acquire
Compaq Computer Corp. for $23.8 billion, said Monday that its fiscal
first-quarter sales and profit beat forecasts as consumer demand for
personal computers and printers picked up.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings in the period ended Thursday were substantially more than
16 cents a share, the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call, and sales exceeded expectations, HP said.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard's report came less than two weeks after Compaq
raised its targets for 2002 sales and profit. HP Chief Executive
Carly Fiorina said the improved results showed that buying Compaq
wouldn't crimp earnings, a claim made by director Walter Hewlett in
his challenge to the purchase. Some investors and analysts said the
earlier forecasts may have been too low.</LD>
<TE>   "They set a very low standard for themselves," said Tom Rath, a
fund manager at Safeco Asset Management Co., referring to
Hewlett-Packard. "It was important for them in regards to convincing
shareholders to vote for the merger." Safeco, which manages about $30
billion in assets, owned 911,300 Hewlett-Packard shares as of
December.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of HP, the second-largest computer maker, rose 4 cents to
close at $22.04 on Monday and have gained 7.3% this year.
Houston-based Compaq, the second-largest PC maker, rose 10 cents to
$12.20, 12% less than the value of Hewlett-Packard's offer. Compaq
has risen 25% in 2002. Both stocks trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard is motivated to be "as bullish as possible, given
the tenuous nature of the deal" with Compaq, Kimberly Alexy, an
analyst for Prudential Securities Inc., wrote in a research report.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter sales rose moderately from the fourth quarter ended
in October, HP said. On Nov.14, the company said sales would fall.
The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call was  sales of
$10.65 billion. Fourth-quarter revenue was $10.9billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not distracted by the merger or the challenges of
integration, and our customers are not defecting," Fiorina said in a
speech broadcast on the Internet from the Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
Technology Investment Symposium in La Quinta, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's first quarter, Hewlett-Packard had net income of
$328 million, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $11.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   HP said it would report final first-quarter results Feb. 13.</TE>

<HD>Congress Sees Rise in Tech-Related Legislation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 500 technology-related bills have been introduced in the
current session of Congress, a sign that lawmakers have lost their
reluctance to regulate the Internet for fear of discouraging its
growth, according to a study released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Tech-related legislation accounts for 10% of all the bills
introduced so far, according to Technology Daily, a Washington
publication that tracks technology policy. Experts attribute the
surge to post-Sept. 11 security concerns and aggressive lobbying by
Silicon Valley companies. The legislation study was conducted by the
Cato Institute, a Washington think tank.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, the measures seek to promote faster Internet
access, limit online gambling, expand taxation of electronic
commerce, require the compulsory licensing of online music and
bolster protection of personal information in cyberspace.</LD>
<TE>   Bill sponsors say action is necessary because technology and the
Internet have become a more important part of society and people's
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Blanket deregulatory policy has not produced the public interest
benefits everybody thought they would," said Andy Davis, a spokesman
for Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the Senate Commerce Committee
chairman. He said "stronger enforcement" and federal intervention is
needed in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiment is a departure from the Internet's early years,
when only a few issues--mostly online pornography and e-mail
spam--attracted notice from lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Congress and industry executives agreed that government
must keep its hands off the Internet to allow the complex and dynamic
technology sector to be innovative and grow.</TE>
<TE>   But with the economy stumbling, lawmakers now want to tinker with
the leading symbol of the new economy. What's more, Silicon Valley
has invaded Washington in droves and begun lobbying for a long list
of legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bills also show that the Internet remains a convenient
political target, said Alan Davidson, associate director of the
Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. "There's a desire
to find someone to blame for society's ills," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts see little public groundswell for much of the
technology legislation and say few of the bills have a chance of
becoming law.</TE>

<HD>Sprint Reports $1.24-Billion Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp., the third-largest U.S. long-distance telephone company,
said Monday that it lost $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter because
of costs to cut jobs and to end a data-services project that drew too
few users.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was $1.35 a share, compared with a loss of $416 million,
or 42 cents, a year ago. Revenue fell 7% to $6.6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Per-share results reflect payment of preferred dividends.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items, Sprint earned 27 cents a share, compared
with 41 cents a year earlier and missing analysts' estimate of 30
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint announced its results after the close
of regular trading. The company's shares fell $1.21, or 7%, to $16.01
in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours
trading, the stock recovered some ground, rising to $17.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint, which is slashing 7,500 jobs, has had five straight sales
declines as it loses customers to new competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The company had expenses of $1.80 billion related to job cuts and
ending its ION project. ION, which Sprint spent $2 billion building,
was to allow customers to simultaneously call, send faxes and access
the Internet on a single line.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint and its rivals have been hurt by competition as the Baby
Bells entered the long-distance market and customers shift to e-mail.
Meanwhile, its wireless telephone arm, Sprint Corp.-PCS Group,
suffered as a result of slowing growth in the U.S. wireless market.
Sprint's main local and long-distance telephone and data business,
FON Group, lost $904 million, or $1.02 a share, compared with a
profit of $99 million, or 11 cents, a year ago, as revenue fell 8.7%
to $4.01 billion.</TE>
<TE>   PCS, the fourth-biggest U.S. wireless operator, narrowed its loss
to $328 million, or 33 cents a share, after preferred dividends, from
$512 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 42% to $2.76
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sprint PCS fell $1.83, or 12%, to $13.76 on the NYSE.
They've fallen 44% this year.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings news Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Priceline.com reported fourth-quarter results that beat
expectations slightly, but its outlook for this year sent its stock
down sharply.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwalk, Conn.-based name-your-own-price Internet company
reported a net loss of $1.3million, or 1 cent a share, for the
October-December period. That was much narrower than a loss of $105
million, or 62 cents a share, for the fourth quarter a year earlier,
when the company had substantial downsizing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time gains and losses, Priceline.com reported a pro
forma profit of $3.3 million, or 1 cent a share. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call expected a break-even quarter before
one-time items.</TE>
<TE>   Priceline confirmed expectations for this year of pro forma profit
of 12 cents a share. Shares of Priceline.com closed down $1.49, or
23.5%, at $4.83 Monday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter this year, Priceline.com said it expects its
pro forma results to range from break-even to a profit of 2 cents a
share and revenue of $260 million to $290 million. Analysts had
expected revenue of $299 million and profit of 2 cents a share.</TE>

<HD>Developer Pleads Guilty to Bribery</HD>
<DH>Huntington Park: He is caught on videotape giving $4,000 to
mayor, who was working undercover for the FBI.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A real estate developer pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to
paying a $4,000 bribe to Huntington Park's mayor, who was working
undercover for the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   Harry Hwang, 49, of Hancock Park faces 12 to 30 months in prison
when he is sentenced in Los Angeles federal court April 15 on two
counts of bribery.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Richard Loya went to the FBI after Hwang first offered him a
bribe to gain his support for a $110-million retail and entertainment
center and his vote to forgive past due fees owed to the city,
according to federal prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Wearing a concealed recording device, Loya met several more times
with Hwang and was offered campaign contributions, a job and $4,000
for a cruise to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "This has gone through a lengthy process, and justice is being
done," Loya said Monday. "You can't go bribing elected officials, and
hopefully more of my colleagues, when offered little things, will not
only turn them down but turn people in."</TE>
<TE>   While not denying the payoff, Hwang's lawyer, Brian Hennigan, said
his client offered Loya money only after the mayor told him that he
had reservations about the project and that he was heavily in debt
from a recent election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel N. Shallman disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that's going to be litigated at sentencing,"
Shallman said. "It's our belief that it was the defendant who offered
the bribe and had corrupt intentions when he did so."</TE>
<TE>   The bribery case grew out of Hwang's efforts to build the retail
and entertainment center in Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   A previous council had given tentative approval for the
development. According to federal authorities, Hwang sought Loya's
help in getting a $7-million subsidy from the city to get the project
going.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang was accused of promising Loya campaign contributions in
exchange for his support in obtaining the subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that during a subsequent meeting, Hwang offered
to make Loya the development's property manager after he left the
City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, prosecutors said, Hwang offered to launder political
contributions to Loya through tenants at a mini-mall he operates.
Hwang allegedly said he had done the same for another Huntington Park
council member.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hwang offered to pay for a cruise that Loya and his wife
were planning to take to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, FBI agents videotaped Hwang outside the Bonaventure
Hotel in Los Angeles as he handed Loya an envelope with $4,000 in
$100 and $20 bills.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang was originally indicted on six felony counts. The government
agreed to drop four of those counts in exchange for Hwang's guilty
plea.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter allowed Hwang to remain free
on $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang formerly operated the L.A. Casino card club in Huntington
Park. Hennigan, his attorney, said the club ceased operations two
years ago when business fell off as a result of the Alameda Corridor
construction project.</TE>
<TE>   Some city officials said Monday that they believe the federal
investigation is continuing. Council members and city officials
received subpoenas last week ordering them to appear Thursday before
a federal grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear, however, whether they will still be required to
appear.</TE>

<HD>Organist Retiring on High Note</HD>
<DH>Music: With hands, and feet, dancing across the keyboards,
UCLA veteran plays his farewell recital tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the power of the pipe organ that first grabbed Thomas Harmon
as a lad of 11 when he heard it thunder at First Methodist Church in
Springfield, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   More than half a century later, as he prepares to step down as
curator of UCLA's five organs, Harmon has grown to cherish the more
delicate qualities of the "king of instruments."</LD>
<LD>   "I appreciate the organ's infinite variety of more subtle colors,"
he says</LD>
<TE>   After 34 years at UCLA, during which he oversaw refurbishment of
Royce Hall's famed organ not once but twice after earthquakes sent
the towering pipes tumbling like so many pickup sticks, Harmon, 62,
will play his farewell recital tonight.</TE>
<TE>   A "privileged career," he calls it. Privileged, perhaps, but also
marked by challenges--as earthquakes, floods and performance-hall
remodelings can attest.</TE>
<TE>   When Harmon arrived at UCLA as a fledgling assistant professor
after a year and a half as acting university organist at Stanford, he
made it one of his first tasks to renew interest in Royce Hall's
rundown and nearly unplayable organ. Within a year, the
instrument--created by the premier Skinner Organ Co. of Boston and
originally installed in 1930--was once again in good form, with a
new, movable console.</TE>
<TE>   A thorough cleaning and the replacement of the worn leather
covering thousands of pneumatic pouches and many bellows were
completed in 1971--just in time for the Sylmar earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   That temblor, Harmon says, dealt the organ a "discouraging blow,"
causing a large set of pedal pipes to topple into 400 smaller pipes
below, damaging all beyond repair and showering the freshly cleaned
organ with dirt and plaster debris. The crushed pipes were replaced.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, another releathering of the Skinner was
ordered up. It was finished weeks before the January 1994 Northridge
quake severely damaged Royce Hall and its organ.</TE>
<TE>   With Royce in need of renovation, Harmon persuaded the university
to enlarge and modernize the Skinner organ. A new five-manual,
computer-augmented console was built. And the pipe chamber over the
stage, which towers more than 50 feet above the auditorium floor, was
enlarged. It now holds 6,200 pipes. After nearly six silent years,
Harmon inaugurated the refurbished instrument in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   At a three-hour rehearsal Saturday morning, Harmon gave new
meaning to multitasking. Sporting special thin-soled black shoes, his
feet danced across the pedal keyboard and moved the slanted
expression pedals, opening and closing large shutters above and
behind the pipes to make the music louder or softer. His hands zipped
across the five keyboards, creating a pleasing cacophony.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has been home to only three other university organists. The
first, Alexander Schreiner, performed three recitals a week to large
audiences from 1930 to 1939, and went on to redesign the Mormon
Tabernacle organ in the 1940s. His successor, George McManus, was
better known as a pianist. Then in 1941 came Laurence Petran, who
served until Harmon came on board.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon earned graduate degrees at Stanford and at Washington
University in St. Louis. He also studied for a year in Vienna as a
Fulbright scholar with Anton Heiller, one of several mentors who
encouraged Harmon to specialize in the organ works of Bach. Harmon's
doctoral dissertation, "The Registration of J.S. Bach's Organ Works,"
still stands as the definitive study.</TE>
<TE>   University organists are a relatively rare breed, probably
numbering in the hundreds, compared to the thousands of church
organists, Harmon noted. They can approach their careers in unusual
ways.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, for example, Harmon gave his recitals in two parts.
They would open in Schoenberg Hall, running until intermission, when
he and his audience would migrate to Royce.</TE>
<TE>   His farewell recital--in just the one location this time--will
encompass sounds great and small, from the muscular "Prelude and
Trumpetings" by Myron Roberts and Bach's "Passacaglia" to Dietrich
Buxtehude's delicate "Fantasia on the Chorale."</TE>
<TE>   Among Harmon's standout memories is serving as chairman of UCLA's
music department for seven years. He also fondly recalls
collaborating with many big names, including Zubin Mehta and the Los
Angeles Philharmonic; Mehli Mehta (Zubin's father) and the American
Youth Symphony; and Jose Limon, the modern dance choreographer.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues laud him as an inspiring leader devoted to high
standards of instrument building and musicology.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a superb colleague and a good friend, one you could
always count on," said Ladd Thomas, a professor of music and chair of
the organ department at USC's Thornton School of Music.</TE>
<TE>   If Harmon's father had had his way, Thomas Harmon would have spent
his career wielding a scalpel rather than pounding out organ works.
He began college as a pre-med student, and his two younger brothers
went on to become physicians like their father, who in his spare time
was a talented saxophonist. He died in 1989, having accepted only
with great difficulty Harmon's decision to pursue a music career.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon is phasing in his retirement. He recently stepped down
after 20 years as organist at First United Methodist Church in Santa
Monica. He will continue to teach at UCLA until June, when he plans
to move to Medford, Ore., with his wife, Sue. The couple remarried in
December after having been divorced for 14 years. They plan to spend
their time cooking and gardening.</TE>
<TE>   How successful he will be at leaving the concert organ behind
remains to be seen. His relationship with the instrument, Harmon
says, "was love at first sight--and hearing."</TE>

<HD>Judges Say New Drug Law Is Working</HD>
<DH>Treatment: Statistics indicate rehabilitation instead of
jail fails to reach 30% of users, but many applaud results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 30% of Los Angeles County defendants sentenced to drug
rehabilitation rather than prison or county jail under Proposition 36
either failed to show up or dropped out of treatment programs in the
first six months the new law was in effect, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   However, judges and county officials say they are pleased with the
early results, considering drug users are the ones being served by
California's novel sentencing program.</LD>
<LD>   "The preliminary indication is that this is working," said Carol
Morris Lowe, director of planning for the county Alcohol and Drug
Program. "We're going to have to refine it and tweak it, but I think
it's a good start."</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 36, approved in 2000 by 61% of the voters, requires
that nonviolent drug offenders convicted of possession, use or
transportation of drugs for personal use be offered treatment and
probation rather than being locked up.</TE>
<TE>   The effectiveness of the law is being closely watched in other
states, including Michigan, Ohio and Florida, where the proposition's
authors are planning similar ballot measures.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 4,329 defendants sentenced to drug-treatment programs in
Los Angeles County from July 1 to year's end, 69%, or 3,008, were
still receiving treatment at the end of the year, according to
numbers recently made available by the Alcohol and Drug Program. A
few participants had already finished their treatment by Dec. 31.
Bench warrants were issued for several hundred defendants who failed
to return to court.</TE>
<TE>   No statewide statistics are yet available, but counties are
collecting data individually. In Orange County, 67% of the 1,978
defendants referred for drug treatment were still in programs at the
end of December. San Diego County reported about 54% of its 1,578
defendants still in treatment. The numbers in Ventura County were
higher--81% of the 992 people referred were in programs at year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   Officials across the state pointed out that the statistics were
preliminary.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have a much better picture of how this is all going to
shake out when we have a full year of data," said Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Ana Maria Luna, who is heading a countywide task
force on the law.</TE>
<TE>   The task force made several findings based on statistics from the
first six months:</TE>
<TE>   * Although the initiative was touted as a way to get first- and
second-time offenders into treatment, the average participant has
been arrested 14 times previously and has two felony and five
misdemeanor convictions.</TE>
<TE>   * Four of five participants are men. More than half are 36 years
old and older. The racial breakdown is 36% Latino, 30% African
American, 30% white, 2% Asian and 2% other.</TE>
<TE>   * Fifteen percent of participants were deemed severely addicted to
drugs and required residential treatment. Forty-one percent were
referred to the lowest level of treatment, outpatient meetings
several times a week. The bulk--44%--were assigned to day programs
lasting several hours per session.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug Court participation is down about 23% since Proposition 36
took effect. Drug Court participants complete a yearlong treatment
program that involves frequent counseling, testing and court
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Necessary Tools Lacking, Judge Says</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Ellen DeShazer, who handles both Drug Court
and Proposition 36 cases, said that she believes in treatment but
that the ballot measure was poorly written and inadequately funded.
She also said the law lacks serious sanctions and that defendants
have too many chances to fail.</TE>
<TE>   The proposition "doesn't give the court all the tools it needs to
make it work," she said. "It's like a bark and no bite. It doesn't
give you the same leverage."</TE>
<TE>   In Drug Court, judges can throw noncompliant participants in jail
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the state, participants are more severely addicted
than expected, said Del Sayles-Owen, deputy director of the
California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. That has created
a shortage of residential beds in some counties, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite worries in Los Angeles County that there would not be
enough courtrooms or treatment centers to handle the influx of drug
defendants, officials said last week that the law has put stress on
county resources but not overwhelmed them.</TE>
<TE>   County Probation Department Bureau Chief Dave Davies said there
have been about 40% fewer defendants than anticipated participating
in drug treatment.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly because nearly 300 eligible defendants refused
treatment, officials said. Many of them chose a short stay in county
jail over drug treatment, which can last up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have really strained the system had the numbers come
through that we were expecting," Davies said.</TE>
<TE>   But probation officers, judges and treatment providers said the
county still needs more than its state-allotted $30 million to make
Proposition 36 work. Additional funds could pay for more lawyers and
court staff to handle cases, as well as more drug counselors and
probation officers to supervise defendants, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The head of a Gardena-based center, Larry Gentile, said that the
influx of clients from Proposition 36 has not been as heavy as he
anticipated, but that the number is rising. As of December, 42% of
his outpatient clients were Proposition 36 enrollees. Some staff
members at his Behavioral Health Services work six days a week and
into the night, Gentile said.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors of the ballot measure said its goals were to save the
state money, reduce the prison population, lower addiction rates and
increase public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The California prison population dropped by about 4,355 inmates
from last July 1 to Dec. 31, according to the state Department of
Corrections. However, that decrease is only partly because of
Proposition 36, said department spokesman Russ Heimerich.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment is far cheaper than incarceration. A year in prison
costs the state an average of $25,600, while treatment ranges from
$840 to $7,400, according to the Northern California-based Drug
Policy Alliance, which championed the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "It has had an immediate impact in that we are starting to see
some people diverted who might normally have had felony convictions,"
Heimerich said. "But it's not going to have a huge impact on the
[prison] population until further down the road."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to reducing addiction, Luna, the superior court
judge, said that she would like to see even more defendants follow
through on their drug treatment, but that she recognizes the
challenges. Some of the defendants, she said, are homeless, have been
battling drug addiction their entire lives or suffer from mental
illness. Many also lack motivation, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have the resources to provide for their basic
needs--shelter, food, medication," Luna said. "This is not just a
matter of going to meetings. They have issues that go far beyond
that."</TE>
<TE>   Participants are required to visit an assessment center for
evaluation and then to enroll in a treatment center, often without
money or transportation to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The county needs to make it possible for defendants to go directly
from court to treatment centers, said Bob Mimura, director of the
county's Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of little hurdles," he said, each one making it
more difficult to remain off drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the problem of drug testing during treatment, which
is not funded under the law. Thus defendants or treatment centers
have had to pick up the costs. A new law set aside $8.4 million
statewide for testing, but Los Angeles County has yet to receive its
$2-million share.</TE>
<TE>   Personal Stories Are Heartening</TE>
<TE>   The Drug Policy Alliance expects 60% to 70% of defendants to
complete treatment. Dan Abrahamson, director of legal affairs for the
group, said there are many personal stories from people who are
already benefiting from Proposition 36.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, that's what it was about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Rita Miller said defendants in her courtroom
have similarly inspiring stories. One recovering addict had his first
sober Thanksgiving with family members in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   William Anderson, 52, hopes he will be a Proposition 36 success
story.</TE>
<TE>   A heroin user for 25 years, he said he has been locked up several
times for drug violations. On Halloween night, he was picked up
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I got tired of going to jail," Anderson said. "I got tired of
waking up in the morning sick."</TE>
<TE>   He appeared before Miller last week for a progress report.
Anderson said he had not used drugs since he was sentenced Jan. 14.
Miller congratulated Anderson for enrolling in a program.</TE>

<HD>Davis Ads Have Riordan on Defensive Over Abortion Issue</HD>
<DH>Politics: Latest spot shows GOP candidate saying, 'I think
it's murder,' in '91 interview.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, Richard Riordan has made support for abortion rights a
centerpiece of his campaign for governor. The implicit argument: No
Republican opposed to abortion rights can beat Democratic incumbent
Gray Davis in November.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis has reached back into Riordan's past to cast him in
precisely the terms Riordan hoped to avoid: as an opponent of
abortion rights in a state that has strongly supported them.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan's record on both sides of the abortion debate has made the
Davis attack possible--and has forced Riordan in recent days to field
questions about his commitment to abortion rights.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan gave more than $10,000 to anti-abortion groups in the late
1980s and early 1990s. Then, in a television interview in 1991,
Riordan said he agreed "very strongly" with the Roman Catholic
Church's opposition to abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Being fairly liberal-minded, I surprise myself at my emotions on
the abortion issue, because I feel very--I think it's murder," he
said in the interview.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Davis began airing a television ad that shows Riordan
making those remarks. It is the second Davis spot that questions
Riordan's credentials as a "pro-choice" candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan faces Republicans Bill Jones and Bill Simon Jr. in the
March 5 Republican primary. But Riordan and Davis have campaigned as
if they were already facing off in the general election--a reflection
of Riordan's strong lead in fund-raising and early polls.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Riordan's assertion that he favors abortion rights, he has
a history on the other side of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, his foundation donated $250 to the Right to Life League
of Southern California. In 1991, it gave $10,000 to Americans United
for Life. Both groups seek to outlaw abortion. Americans United for
Life is a legal arm of the nation's anti-abortion movement.</TE>
<TE>   But two years later, in his first campaign for mayor, Riordan
described himself as "pro-choice"--a position he has adhered to ever
since.</TE>
<TE>   Questions Increasing</TE>
<TE>   Since the first Davis ad questioning Riordan's abortion record
began airing more than a week ago, Riordan has been peppered with
questions about his stand on the subject, often a difficult one for
Roman Catholic politicians such as himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like abortion," Riordan said last week. "However, I
respect and support the right of a woman to make her own choices with
respect to her body."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he still believes abortion is murder, as he stated
in 1991, he responded, "I'm just not going to get into that," but
added: "I am a champion of a woman's right to make her own decision,
so obviously I don't think it's a crime. It goes without saying."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he did not remember the Right to Life League
donation. The $10,000 contribution to Americans United for Life was
solicited, he said, by "a lawyer who I'd known well for years who was
very much involved with this group."</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason I gave was because I knew him well, and he asked
me to," Riordan said. "I can't remember his name. He was a partner at
Kindel &amp; Anderson at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said the donation paid for "advertising encouraging girls
to put children up for adoption," a goal he said he still considers
worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he had donated to groups that favor abortion rights,
Riordan replied, "I doubt it." He also has declined to fill out
questionnaires from Planned Parenthood and the California Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League, which ask candidates to detail
their positions on abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan declined to say whether his thinking on abortion had
changed over time.</TE>
<TE>   He said he disagreed with state court cases that bar requirements
for parental notification when minors have abortions, but pledged to
uphold the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly believe it's in the child's interest, and society's
interest, that the child discuss having an abortion with her parents
or some other adult that they respect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he would support a ban on certain late-term
abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the
mother's life. Some proponents of abortion rights see efforts to ban
the controversial procedure as the first step toward more restrictive
laws on all abortions.</TE>
<TE>   In his TV spots, Davis cites Riordan's donations to anti-abortion
groups and his support for the Reagan administration's effort to put
Robert Bork--an advocate of overturning Roe vs. Wade--on the U.S.
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the chief architect of Davis' reelection campaign,
said Riordan was calling himself "pro-choice" for political gain.
South questioned Riordan's inability to recall the circumstances of
his donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would an Israeli contribute a dime to Hamas, which is
dedicated to destroying the state of Israel?" South asked. "Why would
a black American contribute a penny to the white Aryan Nations, which
is dedicated to obliterating blacks in the United States of America?"</TE>
<TE>   South said Riordan's "flip-flop" on abortion was part of a
pattern. He cited news interviews in which Riordan deviated from his
support for the death penalty and opposition to tax increases.
Riordan denied he has changed his views.</TE>
<TE>   "Either he's lying through his teeth or he's losing his marbles,"
South said.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ads are intended to raise doubts not just about
Riordan's stand on abortion, but also about his trustworthiness.</TE>
<TE>   The new ad concludes with the same question posed in an earlier ad
that depicts the GOP candidate as a foe of abortion rights:
"Riordan--is this a record we can trust?" Not coincidentally, the
same question caps another Davis spot that trashes Riordan's record
fighting crime as mayor of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Vote Crucial</TE>
<TE>   By picking abortion as his first line of attack, Davis is seeking
in part to undercut Riordan's support among women, who are crucial to
the GOP candidate. A Los Angeles Times poll released last week found
Riordan running nearly even with Davis among women--an ominous sign
for the governor of a state where women usually lean heavily toward
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the Davis strategy in using abortion against
Riordan is its potential to rile both sides. Abortion rights
proponents, the Davis camp surmised, could be upset by Riordan's past
support for antiabortion groups; opponents could be angered by his
current defense of abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some on both sides of the debate have reacted accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure Richard Riordan knows where he stands on the issue,"
said Jan Carroll, legal analyst for the California ProLife Council.
The council, which opposes abortion, has endorsed Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Among abortion rights groups, Davis is the preferred candidate;
both Planned Parenthood and the California Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League have endorsed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "If indeed you're pro-choice, then you're not going to be
supporting organizations that are working against that principle,"
said Belle Taylor-McGhee, the league's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Quinn, a Republican strategist, said Riordan made a mistake
by focusing during the primary on the divisive abortion issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan has managed to get into a debate with himself over his
abortion views," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Abortion is a subject that is damaging to Republican
candidates--anywhere, any time."</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Spillane, Riordan's political director, said Davis'
attack would have no impact on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the campaign, we've always said Richard Riordan is
going to be Richard Riordan," he said. "That's why he talks about the
fact that he's pro-choice, because that's an important part of this
campaign."</TE>

<HD>Utilities Are Ruled Liable for Pollution</HD>
<DH>Court: Water agencies argued unsuccessfully that they could
not be sued over illnesses because such matters are regulated by the
state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Victims of contaminated water can sue utilities regulated by the
state for violating safe drinking water standards, the California
Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision clears the way for victims of ground-water pollution
across the state to seek financial compensation from private
companies and public agencies that provide contaminated water.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Hulett, who argued before the court on behalf of regulated
utilities, said her clients will fight the litigation because of the
potential consequences.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to protect water suppliers as well as the public," she
said. "If we had all these lawsuits, the cost of water would be
really seriously affected."</TE>
<TE>   In the cases before the court, about 2,500 alleged victims of
ground-water pollution in the San Gabriel Valley contend that they
have been harmed by drinking water tainted by industrial solvents and
other chemicals. Dozens of the plaintiffs say the contamination gave
them blood-related forms of cancer. A state probe in 1998 found that
the water was safe to drink.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the ground-water contamination
began in the 1960s and persisted for decades. The federal government
in 1984 designated the ground-water basin a Superfund cleanup site.</TE>
<TE>   Residents sued regulated utilities and municipal and private water
agencies, in addition to the industrial users who allegedly
contaminated the water. The defendants all sought to dismiss the
lawsuits on the grounds that the state Public Utilities Commission
has jurisdiction over such matters.</TE>
<TE>   Previous rulings suggested that the regulated utilities might
prevail on this point, but the legal issues had never before been
tested by the high court in just such a case. The San Gabriel Valley
lawsuits are the first in the state in which water agencies have been
sued for selling contaminated water, said a lawyer for one of the
utilities. Most lawsuits have been aimed at the polluters.</TE>
<TE>   Gary A. Praglin, who represents about 500 of the plaintiffs, said
he hopes that Monday's ruling prompts regulated companies "to think
twice before they serve water that has contamination." The ruling
allows the plaintiffs to have a trial on their claims.</TE>
<TE>   "And I hope they think about compensating the people who have
cancer in this case before the people die," said Praglin, whose Los
Angeles law firm represented victims of ground-water pollution in a
case made famous by paralegal Erin Brockovich.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to dismiss the lawsuits, the defendants cited the 1998
investigation by the PUC into allegations of contamination in water
delivered by regulated utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The state regulatory agency concluded that the utilities had
"substantially complied" with state requirements over the last 25
years and delivered drinking water that was safe.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's decision, written by Justice Ming W. Chin, the state
high court said plaintiffs can sue all of the defendants, including
state-regulated utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The decision reaffirmed the power of the PUC to regulate water
utilities in both pricing and water quality. But the court said that
allowing a jury to determine whether the utilities met government
standards would not interfere with PUC regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "A court has jurisdiction to enforce a water utility's legal
obligation to comply with PUC standards and policies and to award
damages for violations," Chin wrote in Hartwell vs. Superior Court,
S082782.</TE>
<TE>   The court limited the liability for regulated utilities, however.
It ruled that these utilities cannot be held responsible for
contamination if they delivered water that met government standards.</TE>
<TE>   Hulett, the utilities' lawyer, said she was disappointed that the
ruling allows a jury to determine whether her clients met drinking
water standards.</TE>
<TE>   But she said the suppliers in the case at hand can show that they
did comply.</TE>
<TE>   "The water agencies are not going to settle because the last thing
we need is to invite more lawsuits," Hulett said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have not violated standards and we have not caused anyone
to become ill ... we are not going to settle a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Private water companies and municipal agencies can be found
responsible for contamination even if the water they delivered met
health standards at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph F. Butler, a lawyer for three private water companies sued
in the case, said his clients will show that the water they delivered
met government standards and caused no harm.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that the cost of the litigation impacts the price
that water wholesalers charge for the water, then it could ultimately
impact the price to the consumer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   David A. Rosen, whose law firm represents about 2,000 of the
litigants, said the ruling may spur residents elsewhere in the state
to sue water agencies for harm caused by water pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been waiting to see whether they could go to court,"
Rosen said.</TE>

<CX>   Pollution ruling--The headline on a Feb. 5 California section story
was misleading in saying that utilities had been ruled liable for
pollution. As the story stated, the California Supreme Court ruled that
state-regulated utilities could be sued over water pollution, but could
be found liable only if they violated government drinking water
standards.</CX>

<LD>   The petition is a reversal for Verizon Wireless, which had tried
for seven months to salvage the auction results and get the licenses.
The carrier is losing $250,000 a day in interest on the deposit it
paid on $8.8 billion in bids, the person said. Canceling the sale
would erase the debt.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier is acting because the Federal Communications
Commission has declined to refund the down payment as the company
requested. Verizon and the other auction winners paid the money a
year ago, before an appeals court in June upended the sale and
returned the frequencies to NextWave.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Marriott, a spokesman for the FCC, and NextWave Deputy
General Counsel Michael Wack declined to comment. A Verizon Wireless
spokesman wouldn't comment.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Shares Plunge on New Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN POPE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Tyco International Inc. plunged again Monday on accounting
worries even as the company announced a debt-restructuring plan to
improve liquidity and denied reports that it failed to disclose
details on billions in acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based company's shares fell $5.73, or nearly 16%, to
$29.90 on the New York Stock Exchange after ratings agencies Standard
&amp; Poor's and Fitch downgraded the debt of Tyco International and its
wholly owned financial subsidiary, Tyco Capital. Its shares have
fallen by nearly half since December. In extended trading, shares
were down an additional 45 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco has faced questions since announcing this month plans to
break up into four independent companies in a bid to create more
value for its shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   The company strongly criticized a report in Monday's Wall Street
Journal saying the company made more than $8 billion in acquisitions
in the last three years, but failed to disclose them.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal article concerned an e-mail the company sent to
analysts Thursday in which Tyco said more than a third of the $11.3
billion it spent on acquisitions last year was spent on unannounced
deals. The Journal, which said it was provided with fresh information
about the deals after questioning Tyco, said the company paid $4.19
billion in cash for unannounced deals in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Maryanne Kane said the numbers were correct, but that
the company objected to any suggestions that they amounted to any
kind of failure to disclose. She said Tyco followed proper accounting
procedures, and that it would not make sense for a company with $36
billion in revenue to issue news releases on tiny acquisitions. All
of the numbers, she said, showed up in the bottom line of Securities
and Exchange Commission filings.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Tyco International announced plans to repurchase
$4.5 billion of its commercial debts and improve liquidity, or its
ability to meet its financial obligations.</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call with investors, Tyco Capital officials said
they have been shut out of the corporate bond market in recent days
on accounting worries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely tight today, and I think with the ratings
actions taken place, we have to go on the assumption that the market
is not there for us," Chief Executive Albert R. Gamper said.</TE>
<TE>   Commerzbank fixed-income analyst Steve Altman said Tyco Capital's
credit remains stronger than that of the parent company.</TE>

<HD>Williams May Sell More Assets to Protect Debt Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Williams Cos. said Monday that it may sell pipelines and other assets
to raise cash to protect its credit rating because the company may be
liable for $2.4 billion in debt and lease costs from its spun-off
communications business.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' shares fell $2.64, or 14%, to $16.36 on the New York
Stock Exchange on concern the company will be unable to raise enough
cash from asset sales and will sell more stock, analysts said. A
share sale would dilute the value of holdings that already are down
by one-third since Enron Corp. filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.</LD>
<LD>   "They've got to quantify their exposure to Williams
Communications, and then we can all make a judgment," said Carl
Domino, who manages $1.5 billion in value stocks for Northern Trust
Corp. "Now, no one knows what's going to happen." Domino's
second-biggest holding as of Sept. 30 was Williams with 127,000
shares.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams delayed the release of
fourth-quarter results to review the expenses of Williams
Communications Group Inc., which it spun off in April. Those costs
will be included in fourth-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Williams Communications posted a smaller fourth-quarter
loss than Wall Street expected but also said that its banks warned of
a possible default on terms of a credit agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said it "strongly disagrees" with the banks' position.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors sent the company's stock down 42 cents, or 30%,
to $1 on the Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   The company's net loss narrowed to $372 million, or 76 cents a
share, from $546.6 million, or $1.18, a year ago. Its operating loss
was 52 cents, better than the 57 cents analysts expected. Revenue
grew 15% to $330 million.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TiVo Inc. filed a lawsuit accusing interactive-television rival
Sonicblue Inc. of stealing technology that lets viewers store some
programs while they watch another show.</LD>
<LD>   TiVo filed the federal patent-infringement lawsuit on Jan. 23
against Sonicblue and its ReplayTV Inc. unit.</LD>
<LD>   Sonicblue and TiVo are battling for supremacy in the growing
market for video-data recorders. In December, Sonicblue accused TiVo
of infringing a Sonicblue patent for devices that pause and replay TV
shows.</LD>
<TE>   TiVo's lawsuit seeks damages and a court order blocking Sonicblue
and ReplayTV from selling any infringing products.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Alviso, Calif.-based TiVo fell 11 cents to $5.75, while
Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sonicblue fell 15 cents to $4.60, both on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>P&amp;O Princess Rejects Another Carnival Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>P&amp;O Princess Cruises, the third-largest cruise operator, rejected a
second increased hostile bid by No.1 cruise line Carnival Corp. as
inadequate and reiterated its plan to buy Miami-based Royal Caribbean
Cruises.</LD>
<LD>   The price of Carnival's latest proposal is "too low," P&amp;O Princess
Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe said.</LD>
<LD>   London-based P&amp;O Princess has rejected three Carnival bids, citing
concern about regulatory approval, and is pursuing a $7.4-billion
plan to buy No.2 operator Royal Caribbean.</LD>
<TE>   P&amp;O Princess fell 40 cents to $22.85 on the NYSE. Royal Caribbean
fell 65 cents to $17.53, and Carnival fell 82 cents to $26.06--also
on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival, based in Miami, on Wednesday raised its all-stock bid,
valuing P&amp;O Princess at $5.1 billion, plus the assumption of P&amp;O
Princess debt of $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;O Princess is scheduled to hold a meeting Feb. 14 to ask
shareholders to approve its combination with Royal Caribbean.
Carnival reiterated its call for investors to vote to adjourn the
meeting until U.S. and British regulators review both proposals.</TE>

<HD>Man Asks for Help Sending His Slain Brothers Home</HD>
<DH>Assistance: The pair, shot in a Santa Ana parking lot, sent
almost half of paychecks to families in Mexico, sibling says. Robbery
and gang ties ruled out.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Friends and relatives of two brothers who were fatally shot last week
contacted the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana on Monday for help
returning the bodies to Mexico for burial.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Parra, 25, said he hopes to return his brothers, Javier and
Saldivor, to their wives, who live in Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what to do anymore," Parra said Monday. "I want to
go back with them too. I don't have anyone else here, and my family
really needs my help."</LD>
<TE>   Mexican Consul Miguel Angel Isidro in Santa Ana said he put the
widows in touch with the Orange County Office of Violent Crime, which
could help defray the burial costs. The consul has also spoken with
local police.</TE>
<TE>   "These were two hard workers who were raising families. It's a
really horrible thing that has happened. It's quite unusual. We just
hope to support the family as we can," Isidro said.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers died Saturday, a day after they were gunned down in a
shopping center outside Hometown Buffet on 17th Street, where they
had worked for four years. Businesses in the small center were closed
and the parking lot nearly empty when the brothers left work about 11
p.m. Friday, investigators said. Javier, 36, and Saldivor, 32, were
wounded after they got into their car, which then rolled across the
restaurant parking lot and struck a tree, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police they heard shots and saw a man running from
the parking lot. Saldivor Parra was taken to UCI Medical Center in
Orange, where he died about 1 a.m. Saturday. Nine hours later, Javier
Parra died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Investigators said
they have few clues. Robbery and gang ties have been ruled out as
motives.</TE>
<TE>   "The information we have right now is very limited," said Santa
Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva. "We're very baffled."</TE>
<TE>   Both brothers had families. Javier, a dishwasher, had three sons
and two daughters. Saldivor, a cook, had two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   The men, who came to Orange County seven years ago, spoke little
English and lived frugally so they could provide for their families,
whom they visited every two years, their brother said. Both sent $200
home to Mexico every two weeks from their $500 paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't drink, no drugs, no nothing," said Omar Parra, who
lives in Anaheim and works as a cook and baker. "It's very
confusing." The brothers shared a rented room in a private home.
There, Saldivor Parra would cook hot buffalo wings, and the brothers
would listen to Mexican and Colombian music, said friend Jose
Ramirez, 29, of Anaheim.</TE>

<HD>The Word From a Warehouse</HD>
<DH>Religion: A church in Huntington Beach has moved from its
tin sanctuary into a courtyard because it doesn't have a permit the
city requires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no golden chalices or holy statues in the Praise Christian
Center chapel.</LD>
<LD>   The walls are unfinished, nearly colorless. Rows of garden benches
and plastic patio chairs substitute for pews. And instead of a cross,
a large Shell Oil logo is affixed to the front of the building--left
behind by a previous landowner.</LD>
<LD>   The church sits inside a 1920s-era warehouse, a tin structure
tucked in a corner of what was once an oil field. The land is now
owned by a landscape-supply company.</LD>
<TE>   Trouble is, Huntington Beach officials say, the little church is
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before Christmas, the Rev. Derek Anunciation was told
he could no longer hold services in the converted warehouse until he
obtained various permits and had fire marshals inspect lights and
ceiling fans. The 34-year-old pastor said it would cost him thousands
of dollars he doesn't have to get the permits.</TE>
<TE>   So Anunciation moved his pulpit--actually a red decorative bridge
with the price tag still dangling from one end--and his congregation
into a gravel courtyard outside the warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   But as his outdoor Sunday services continue, a small battle
between church and state is brewing.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say Anunciation must follow the law and that the
needed inspections and improvements are basic safety measures. The
pastor, though, sees it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pay to pray in the city of Huntington Beach,"
Anunciation said.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation's 80-member congregation moved into the
warehouse--previously used for storage by the landscape company--in
June. Before that, the congregation gathered at a Beach Boulevard
storefront. They moved there after even more humble beginnings at the
Edison Community Center, where, in 1998, Anunciation first held
Sunday services and weekly Bible study sessions for his congregation
of mostly young families.</TE>
<TE>   When Ron Brindle, owner of American Landscape Supply, offered to
let the congregation use one of his warehouses, Anunciation thought
he'd found a home. Brindle had seen the pastor on his weekly cable
show, "God's Way," and took a liking to the young clergyman.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's this guy. He doesn't know where his next dollar's coming
from, and he's paying $1,800 a month to rent this storefront,"
Brindle said. "So I got to thinking, I've got this old building and a
new little parking lot out there. Why not let him use that?"</TE>
<TE>   Brindle isn't charging Anunciation rent, but the pastor agreed to
pay Brindle $200 a week "for maintenance."</TE>
<TE>   Brindle said he suspects City Hall would be happier if he moved
his landscaping business elsewhere and built homes on his property,
which is now zoned for residential use. The property is two miles
from the beaches and sits near some of the town's most expensive
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sitting on $20 million worth of property," Brindle said.
"They'd rather have million-dollar homes."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say Anunciation must apply for a conditional use
permit since the land isn't zoned for church use. If he does seek
such a permit--and Anunciation said he intends to--the city's
Planning Commission must hold a public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If the pastor gets the permit, he must make improvements before he
can lead his flock back indoors. For starters, city officials say, he
must replace two portable toilets behind the warehouse with permanent
ones. He must make the facility accessible to the disabled. And the
improvements he already made--new lighting, doors and other
structural changes--must be inspected and approved.</TE>
<TE>   Follow the Rules or Challenge Them?</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to make some extensive modifications,"
Huntington Beach Fire Marshal Chuck Burney said. "I'm sure it seems
monumental when you look at the building the way it is now. But
whenever you try to convert something like that into a building for a
use that's more demanding, there are a number of changes that are
going to have to be made."</TE>
<TE>   Ross Cranmer, the city's building and safety director, said the
warehouse was fine when used for storage, but is not acceptable as a
meeting house.</TE>
<TE>   Although Anunciation plans to file for his permits, he's also
contemplating falling back on a federal law, the Religious Land Use
and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The statute prohibits
local governments from creating a substantial burden on churches
without proving a "compelling state interest," said Brad Dacus, an
attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, an organization that
defends religious rights and other civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever a local government tells a church they can no longer
meet in a building they've been occupying, that is always going to
qualify as a substantial burden," said Dacus, who has been offering
advice to Anunciation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's highly suspect that the city would suddenly find health and
safety concerns with this building only after it was made available
to be used as a church," Dacus said. "These kinds of intimidating
practices are counterproductive to religious tolerance."</TE>
<TE>   City officials deny singling out Anunciation.</TE>
<TE>   "Any other type of use for that building would have to go through
the same process," Burney said.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation said he will abide by the city wishes and remain
outside his makeshift chapel, leading services under a portable
canopy with parishioners seated on iron garden chairs and musicians
playing from a decorative bridge, identical to the one where the
minister stands.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having tent revival meetings in 2002," he said.</TE>

<HD>Officer Takes a Shot at Prenup Meeting</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An off-duty Long Beach police officer accidentally shot himself in
the leg Monday during a prenuptial counseling session with his
fiancee in Irvine, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The officer was taken to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to
the lower right leg. "He's in good condition, good spirits and
expected to make a full recovery," said Nancy Tabing, a spokeswoman
for the Long Beach Police Department. "As with any officer-involved
shooting, it's our policy not to release the name of the officer
until the investigation is complete."</LD>
<LD>   The 45-year-old officer, who has been with the department 16
years, was sitting on a couch next to his fiancee in an office in the
2100 block of Business Center Drive when the accident occurred about
1 p.m., Tabing said. "They had just sat down on the couch and were
getting ready to begin," she said, when the service revolver in the
holster on his hip began jabbing him in the leg. "He was adjusting
it, trying to make it more comfortable, and it discharged," Tabing
said.</LD>
<TE>   There was no word on whether the incident would affect the
couple's marriage plans. "I would imagine she's pretty shook up,"
Tabing said of the fiancee. "You're nervous enough preparing to get
married and everything. If something like this had happened, I know
it would have scared the heck out of me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed in the
latest auction.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department sold $16 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.735%, up from 1.715% last week. An additional $14
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.830%, unchanged
from last week.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since Nov. 26 when the bills
sold for 1.92%.</LD>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.769% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.10 and 1.872% for a six-month bill selling for $9,907.50.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 2.25% last
week from 2.18% the previous week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eckerd Corp., a drugstore chain owned by J.C. Penney Co., said a
lawsuit accusing it of bilking customers out of more than $100
million by overcharging for medicine is "without merit."</LD>
<LD>   The class-action suit, filed in Broward County, Fla., claimed
Eckerd engaged in a practice of "rounding up" certain prescription
quantities and allegedly overcharged customers.</LD>
<LD>   Prescriptions such as liquids and ointments come from the
manufacturer in fractional quantities and are sold to customers at a
price set for that amount, Clearwater, Fla.-based Eckerd said. Due to
"systems limitations," the quantity, but not the price, needed to be
rounded up to correctly process the drug.</LD>
<TE>   Processing systems were upgraded recently at Eckerd stores.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney rose 20 cents to $23.80
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Developer Says Parks Sought Financial Help in Campaign</HD>
<DH>Politics: Murdock's claim in a letter to the media
contradicts statements by the supervisorial candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire developer David H. Murdock says that Thousand Oaks
Councilwoman Linda Parks asked for his financial support in her run
for a seat on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors--something
Parks has repeatedly denied.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter distributed to area newspapers, Murdock said Parks
asked for his help while attending a charity event at his Arabian
horse ranch near Thousand Oaks last fall.</LD>
<LD>   "Linda Parks was at my farm on Sept. 21, 2001, and asked for my
financial support in the race for the Ventura County Supervisor's
seat," Murdock wrote in the letter. "I gave consideration to that
request but decided instead to support [Parks' opponent] Randy
Hoffman."</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times last week, Murdock said Parks
followed him around at the fund-raiser, eventually cornering him for
a few words.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'I would like you to help me out with my campaign,'" he
recounted, adding that he interpreted that as a request for money.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock's contention is a potential embarrassment for Parks as her
campaign to replace retiring Supervisor Frank Schillo heads to the
March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has built a political career opposing development in the
Thousand Oaks area. She kicked off her supervisorial bid to represent
the Thousand Oaks-based 2nd District by pledging not to take money
from developers.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, chief executive of Dole Food Co., also owns a development
company that built the luxury Sherwood Country Club estates south of
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks on Monday again dismissed Murdock's assertion as
"ridiculous." Murdock is Hoffman's biggest financial backer, she
noted, and she believes he is not above slinging mud to help him.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is Mr. Hoffman trying to justify taking
$91,000 from the largest landowner in District 2," she said. "I have
never taken a developer contribution in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Parks disputed that she was even at Murdock's Ventura Farms ranch
on Sept. 21. She said she did attend a fund-raiser benefiting
autistic children at Murdock's home on Sept. 8 and spoke to the
businessman about supporting a new hospital in east Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock could not be reached Monday for further comment. But his
account is backed indirectly by Assemblyman Tony Strickland
(R-Moorpark), who said Murdock told him about the solicitation within
days of the purported exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Murdock was pretty adamant about her following him around and
asking him for his support," said Strickland, a Hoffman supporter.
"At the time, I was considering a run for the supervisor's seat
myself. That's why he told me about it. You don't become CEO of Dole
and someone as successful as he is by not remembering conversations."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' environmental and slow-growth stances have won her two City
Council terms even though Thousand Oaks voters have historically
backed more conservative candidates. In the supervisor's race, she is
supported by a network of growth-control advocates, while Hoffman, a
wealthy entrepreneur, has received much of his support from the
business community.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman is ahead of Parks in campaign fund-raising, tallying
$211,800 to Parks' $73,900. Parks, however, is limiting her
contributions to $500 per individual.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman first brought up the alleged solicitation during a
political forum last month. The issue arose when Parks criticized
Hoffman for taking large contributions from Murdock and other
Thousand Oaks business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Parks denied the allegation on the spot, but Hoffman has repeated
it throughout the campaign. Murdock did not comment on the matter
until he sent the letter to the media late last week.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Limited Inc. is getting intimate again with Victoria's Secret,
proposing to buy back the rest of Intimate Brands Inc., the owner of
the sexy lingerie business, for $1.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Limited Inc., owner of 84% of Intimate Brands, which also sells
Bath &amp; Body Works and products, said Monday that it launched an
exchange offer for the remaining 16% of Intimate Brands, in a move to
allow for greater growth.</LD>
<LD>   The offer values Intimate Brands at about $18.57 a share, a
premium of about 6% from its Monday closing price of $17.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange. News of the deal sent the shares up as much
as 22% to $17.72 in after-hours trading.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Limited closed off 70 cents to $17.75 on the NYSE,
before the deal was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer, which had spun off Intimate
Brands in 1995, said it will offer 1.046 shares of Limited common
stock for each outstanding share of Intimate Brands Class A common
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Limited also said it expects its January sales and fiscal
fourth-quarter profit to "significantly" exceed Wall Street estimates
but added that the retail environment would be challenging in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings should reach 72 to 74 cents a share in the quarter,
compared with the 59-cent average estimate of analysts and up from 55
cents a year ago, Limited said.</TE>
<TE>   The Intimate Brands deal comes less than a week after Rob Bernard,
Limited Stores president and chief executive, resigned.</TE>

<LD>Lowe's Cos., the second-largest home-improvement chain, said its
fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would beat forecasts after
warmer-than-expected weather helped increase sales at stores open at
least a year.</LD>
<LD>   Same-store sales in the quarter ended Friday exceeded the
company's forecast of 3% to 5% growth, and profit topped its estimate
of 22 cents to 24 cents a share, Lowe's said. Analysts' average
estimate was 23 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Net
income for the year-earlier period was 18 cents a share, adjusted for
a stock split announced in May.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Lowe's rose 66 cents to close at $46.36 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>

<LD>European regulators have dropped a yearlong investigation into
charges that Intel Corp. abused its position as the world's leading
computer chip maker to keep rivals from winning market share,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   One of two complaints filed by Intel rivals with the European
Commission, which enforces European Union antitrust law, recently was
withdrawn.</LD>
<LD>   After investigating the other complaint, the commission came "to
the preliminary conclusion that the accusations made against Intel
are unfounded," a spokeswoman said. "Our intention is to close the
file soon."</LD>

<LD>Worried about the economy, banks made loans harder to get for
businesses and for many consumers from November through January, the
Federal Reserve Board said.</LD>
<LD>   Lending standards generally remained unchanged for consumers who
were buying or refinancing homes, according to the survey of senior
loan officers.</LD>
<LD>   The survey showed that 45% of banks tightened credit for
businesses with $50 million or more in annual sales, and 42% did so
for companies with sales under $50 million a year. None had eased
credit standards for businesses. The loan officers cited a "less
favorable or more uncertain economic outlook" as the main reason for
tightening credit.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened in
the first full quarter after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Fed
found.</TE>
<TE>   About one in six banks also tightened standards for credit card
and other consumer loans, except for mortgages.</TE>

<HD>Alschuler Grossman to Relocate to Santa Monica</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through a 10-year sublease deal with Turner Broadcasting Systems
thought to be valued at more than $30 million, law firm Alschuler
Grossman Stein &amp; Kahan will move west from its longtime Century City
home to eastern Santa Monica's commercial hub.</LD>
<LD>   The firm is taking over 85,000 square feet of offices at the Water
Garden I office complex previously occupied by another law
firm--Haight Brown &amp; Bonesteel--which relocated a few miles south to
the Howard Hughes Center.</LD>
<LD>   Alschuler's move from Century City's Century Plaza Towers comes as
rents for vacant offices in that part of Santa Monica are off
markedly from their recent peaks. Landlords are competing with
tenants such as Turner that are trying to sublease unneeded space.</LD>
<TE>   Turner had previously agreed to relocate its Century City
operations to the Water Garden, but later decided it wouldn't need
the former Haight Brown space, and engaged brokers Cindy White,
Robert Chavez and Carol Roth of Staubach Co. to find sublessors.
Meanwhile the 1999 merger of Alschuler Grossman &amp; Pines and Stein &amp;
Kahan prompted the enlarged firm to consider a move. Brokers Hunt
Barnett and Clay Hammerstein of Insignia/ESG and Joel Kurtz at Bailes
&amp; Associates represented the law firm.</TE>
<TE>   The brokers declined to discuss financial specifics of Alschuler's
sublease deal with TBS, but knowledgeable Westside real estate
sources estimated the law firm will pay about $37.50 per square foot
per year. Turner's average annual rent over the course of it's
11-year lease is about $43 or $44 per square foot.</TE>

<HD>Kilroy Relocating Offices to Westside Media Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commercial real estate developer Kilroy Realty Corp. has seen most of
its new buildings fill with tenants even as the region's economy has
declined over the last year or so. Nearly all of the company's new
office buildings--and even some still under construction--are fully
leased.</LD>
<LD>   But the company has struggled to find tenants for the two newest
buildings at its Westside Media Center project ever since would-be
"anchor" tenant EToys closed its doors.</LD>
<LD>   So Kilroy will relocate its corporate headquarters to the West Los
Angeles complex from El Segundo--where the company has been based for
half a century.</LD>
<TE>   Tenant demand for Westside office space has become "fairly anemic"
compared with previous years, Kilroy President and Chief Executive
John B. Kilroy Jr. told analysts during a quarterly conference call
late last week. Other landlords in the West L.A. area also are
struggling with rising vacancy rates and falling rents. They face
competition from tenants looking to sublease extra space as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Westside Media Center project's 78,000-square-foot first
phase, which Kilroy renovated after purchasing, is entirely leased to
AT&amp;T affiliates. The 150,000-square-foot second phase--which EToys
had agreed to lease--sits vacant. And the third phase, offering the
same number of offices as the second, is scheduled for completion by
the end of March and also lacks tenant commitments.</TE>
<TE>   John Kilroy told analysts the company will relocate to Westside
Media Center's phase-two building. The company's current headquarters
is in a 12-story tower at the Kilroy Airport Center complex on
Imperial Highway.</TE>

<HD>Revival for Crenshaw Project?</HD>
<DH>After failed efforts to rebuild an old shopping center, Los
Angeles city officials consider a mixed-use development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by repeated efforts to rebuild a 23-acre shopping center
in the Crenshaw district, Los Angeles city officials are mulling over
a plan for a mix of commercial space and private residences for the
first time in the project's troubled 15-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Observers say the new plan for Santa Barbara Plaza, which would
replace the rundown 1940s-era buildings with 140 single-family homes,
180 senior housing units and 140,000 square feet of retail space, is
more economically feasible than a retail-only project in an area that
has had difficulty attracting name-brand retailers. The sale of the
homes would offset some of the developer's costs and reduce the
amount of city redevelopment funds needed.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say they are intrigued by the plan, but caution
that they still must come up with about $35 million in public funds
before the developer, Los Angeles-based Capital Vision Equities, will
buy the land and begin work on the $100-million project. For the
retail-only plan, the firm had asked for $44 million in public
assistance.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal follows a trend of mixed-use developments that have
been cropping up across the Southland, including the trendy Paseo
Colorado complex that opened last fall in Pasadena and others planned
in Hollywood, Burbank and Long Beach. Such projects, which feature
apartments stacked on top of restaurants and retailing outlets, are
generally aimed at suburbanites weary of driving a car to buy a
newspaper or a meal.</TE>
<TE>   For Santa Barbara Plaza, however, developers had to rethink the
mixed-use concept. The plan does not strive for a dense, "urban" feel
and it targets families looking to purchase a home rather than single
people interested in renting.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's cutting edge," said real estate consultant Larry
Kosmont. "Most people think of mixed-use as a stacked product, but
the key concept behind mixed-use is adjacency and the concept
planning."</TE>
<TE>   Community reaction to the new proposal has been mixed, with some
plaza tenants, who have watched their buildings fall apart and
businesses deteriorate since the mid-1980s, complaining that the
latest shift in the project is just another delay in a seemingly
unending process.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back at square one," said Kwame Antwih, head of the plaza's
tenant association and an African-clothing retailer.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, the once-vibrant shopping center near Martin
Luther King Jr. and Crenshaw boulevards was designated for city
redevelopment funds and targeted by several developers, one of them
Earvin "Magic" Johnson. The former basketball star's development firm
tried to revitalize the plaza after installing the successful Magic
Johnson Theatres in 1995 at the struggling Baldwin Hills mall across
the street. But most observers agree Johnson's foray into Santa
Barbara Plaza failed because of a lack of public funding and
political support.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city entered into exclusive negotiations with
Capital Vision. Plaza tenants say they have been interviewed at
length by the firm's agents, but remain skeptical that Capital Vision
will be more successful than Johnson's company.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what has held up the development for so long is the high
cost of acquiring the site, which has 37 property owners. Chris
Hammond, the firm's president, said he already has agreements with
all but a handful of owners.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment officials say Hammond is the first developer to have
negotiated successfully with so many of the landlords. They also cite
Capital Vision's record in the area. The firm turned an obsolete
dairy-processing plant nearby into a bustling shopping strip that
includes a Home Depot, Food4- Less, Starbucks and McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland's tight housing market and high demand for
moderately priced single-family houses make the site attractive for
the kinds of homes Hammond is proposing to build. "We're trying to do
something that currently doesn't exist in the community," Hammond
said, referring to the neighborhood's prevalent high-density rental
housing.</TE>
<TE>   The homes also would help the project as a whole, Hammond said,
because it would anchor the retail portion by providing a "built-in
audience for things like bookstores and restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, nine acres of residences would wrap around a
horseshoe-shaped commercial cluster looking out onto Martin Luther
King Jr. Boulevard. The design includes walkways that would give
residents easy access to the stores in Santa Barbara Plaza and the
Baldwin Hills mall, which lies just east of the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The homes would be two- and three-bedroom detached three-story
townhouses with about 1,500 square feet of living space, priced from
$250,000 to $300,000, according to Capital Vision.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances that this round would be different from the
last, many tenants say they won't believe in change until they see
it.</TE>
<TE>   "They had us in limbo, and now we're in limbo again," said
Corinthian Uqdah, who owns two hair salons in the plaza. "There's
nothing going on but the deterioration of this area and everybody
waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Olive Walker, who owns a women's clothing shop, says she did not
sell a single item during the holiday season and pays her bills by
working nights as a private nurse.</TE>
<TE>   She would like to move to a better location but cannot afford to
pay higher rent. The $200,000 worth of inventory she has accumulated
over the years prevents her from simply closing up shop. "I don't
want to give up something so valuable that I paid for," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of merchants at the plaza went out of business in the last
decade because they believed redevelopment was around the corner and
failed to make long-term business plans, said Antwih, the head of the
tenants' group.</TE>
<TE>   Some, such as clothing retailer Donna Rose, believe the delay is
the result of something more than simple economics. "It's the same as
if they're trying to wait until all the people here are all gone, or
they're trying to force us out or something, and then they won't have
anything to do but rebuild," Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they are sympathetic to the tenants' plight and
deny that the project has been delayed on purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a really awful event in the city's history," Jerry
Scharlin of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency said last month
at a community meeting about the project. "It isn't intentional to
hurt people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the agency, the developer and city leaders are determined
to end the lengthy gridlock. "Maybe I'm being Pollyannaish, but I
feel there is a real desire and commitment by the city to find a
solution," Scharlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Capital Vision will begin acquiring properties this spring if an
agreement with the city can be reached.</TE>

<HD>Couple Deny Torturing Boy, 3</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Oxnard parents, who have a history of child
abuse, are accused of immersing their son in scalding water and of
not treating his burns properly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard couple with a history of child abuse pleaded not guilty
Monday to charges of torturing their 3-year-old son by submerging him
in a bathtub of scalding water and failing to treat the burns
immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Alfredo and Maria Esquivel, both 25, were charged with seven
felony counts--two of which carry possible life sentences--stemming
from the Dec. 22 incident. Bail was set at $250,000 for each, and a
preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 14.</LD>
<LD>   In court, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Lehr said Alfredo Esquivel
admitted to causing the boy's burns in the couple's home in the La
Colonia section of Oxnard. Authorities said the child, the
second-youngest of four, had soiled his pants on the way to the
bathroom before the couple gave him the scalding bath.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't say whether they were trying to punish him," said Oxnard
Det. Ken Clopman, who investigated the case. "But they should have
known how hot it was when they held him in there."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County notified Oxnard police of the alleged abuse after
the boy's grandmother brought him to a Tijuana hospital, which then
transferred him to UC San Diego Medical Center, Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, who turned 3 on Christmas day, suffered second- and
third-degree burns on 20% of his body from the 146-degree bathwater,
Clopman said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Esquivels attempted to treat the burns using home
remedies, including egg whites and aloe vera, which only made the
boy's condition worse. In the 18 hours before he received proper
medical treatment, the boy also suffered life-threatening infections,
Clopman said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the child risked death or amputation of his toes,
feet or legs, but he now is in stable condition, Clopman said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys for the Esquivels were not immediately available
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court came nearly
three years after the Esquivels were convicted of beating their
then-2-year-old daughter in South Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa J. Serafini, the El Dorado County deputy district attorney
who filed that case, said Alfredo Esquivel had confessed to hitting
the girl with objects such as an electrical cord and a sandal.</TE>
<TE>   His wife admitted to being present at the time and to providing
him with the objects, Serafini said.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1999, Alfredo Esquivel pleaded guilty to one felony count
and was sentenced to 270 days in County Jail, a psychological
evaluation and anger-management classes.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Maria Esquivel pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to 45 sessions of parenting classes, said El Dorado County Superior
Court officials.</TE>
<TE>   The couple also were sentenced to three years' probation, Serafini
said, but El Dorado County Judge Suzanne Kingsbury granted early
termination of that probation on Nov. 30, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, sources said, the same judge released the three
oldest children, including the boy who was later burned, from foster
care back to the Esquivels.</TE>
<TE>   The case involving the girl began in 1998, Serafini said, when
officials at an El Dorado County welfare office noticed bruises on
the 2-year-old's face. Doctors determined that some of the bruises
were caused by the Esquivels' attempts to force-feed her.</TE>
<TE>   "The prior case demonstrates their inability to modify their
behavior to safely parent children," Serafini said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the circumstances in the Esquivel matter mirror those of
another Ventura County child-abuse case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Rogelio Hernandez, then 20, was sentenced to 42 years to
life in prison for torturing to death his 2-year-old daughter,
Joselin. His wife, Gabriela, now 24, did not stop the torture and was
sentenced to 15 years to life, but later had her conviction
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   She pleaded guilty to lesser charges the day her new trial was to
begin and has been serving an 11-year prison sentence since March.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Prosecutors Endorse Totten</HD>
<DH>Elections: Choosing between two of their own, union members
endorse Bradbury's chief assistant to succeed him as district
attorney in next month's vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Prosecutors' Assn. has thrown its support behind
Greg Totten in the race for district attorney, providing a key
endorsement from those who will work closest with the winner of the
March 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   Having to choose between two of their own, the association
announced Monday that Totten, the 47-year-old chief assistant
district attorney, was their choice over senior prosecutor Ron
Bamieh, 36, in a race that has been both costly and bitter.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was based largely on Totten's tenure in the office
and his leadership as chief aide for the last three years to retiring
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, the association said.</LD>
<TE>   "His performance as second-in-command to the district attorney and
his familiarity with the office will enable him to bring a sense of
continuity that our members feel is essential," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ian Morse, spokesman for the association of about 100
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "Further, Mr. Totten will bring a keen sense of justice and a
strong dedication to the people of Ventura County that make him the
right person for the job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Totten has now garnered support from Bradbury, Ventura County
Sheriff Bob Brooks, several police unions and every police chief in
the county.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was particularly pleased to win the endorsement of the
association, since it comes from those in the best position to know
who is the most qualified to be Ventura County's next district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "The confidence of my colleagues in my ability to lead this office
in the 21st century is deeply appreciated," Totten said. "These are
the people I've worked with now for 20 years, and the fact that they
have confidence in me is very important to me personally,
irrespective of the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The race--the first contested election for the post since
1978--has created tension in the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors have swirled about who may be hired and fired, and Bradbury
months ago issued a memo reminding employees that campaigning for the
candidates was prohibited during work hours.</TE>
<TE>   With loyalties split between the two candidates, the two men
squared off in December in a closed-door debate sponsored by the
prosecutors association.</TE>
<TE>   The group's members were allowed to hear from both candidates
before voting on who should receive the endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Association representatives would not reveal the outcome of the
vote, which was tallied by an outside law firm.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh said he was told it was very close. And he said he
thinks many in the office had a tough time deciding.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't tarnish the endorsement at all," said Bamieh, who counts
among his principal supporters the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn.
and former state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley).</TE>
<TE>   "I respect them all," he said. "They struggled with it and did the
best they could."</TE>

<HD>Broker Pleads Guilty to Fraud</HD>

<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura mortgage broker who bilked investors out of nearly $4.6
million pleaded guilty Monday to three counts of mail fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors said they will seek a prison term of 18 months
for Larry Curtis Waltz.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Angela J. Davis said she also will insist
that Waltz, 57, be required to repay his 49 victims, a requirement
under federal sentencing guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Morrow will sentence Waltz on June
10, but some of the investors who entrusted their money to him
believe they'll never see it again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any hope of getting my money back," said David Kupp,
65, a retiree who lost his home and life savings.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of a decade, Kupp said, he gave Waltz about
$400,000. The money was to be used to finance mortgages for people
buying or refinancing homes. Kupp was to receive interest payments
from the borrowers each month.</TE>
<TE>   After several years, he also was to get his principal back, but
when the notes came due, he sunk his money back into attractive new
deals Waltz presented him.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the deals were bogus. Waltz made up the identities of most
of the borrowers and showed his investors phony paperwork,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Kupp and others received monthly payments, but authorities allege
that they were drawn from money given to Waltz by other investors.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd have been a lot kinder to us if he'd come over in the middle
of the night and shot us," said Kupp, who had come to consider Waltz
a close friend.</TE>
<TE>   A former transportation coordinator for the film industry, Kupp,
of Ventura, has lived for more than a year in a motor home parked in
his daughter's driveway in Mariposa. He said his wife moved in with a
relative for a time to make ends meet, and the two recently got jobs
as ranch caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't exactly how I wanted to spend my retirement," Kupp
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter he sent in January 2001, Waltz confessed to his
investors, claiming that he used their money for "risky investments
which you did not authorize."</TE>
<TE>   Because Waltz voluntarily told authorities about his crimes, he
was eligible for a lighter sentence, Davis said. If he had not turned
himself in, he would have faced a 27-month prison term if convicted.</TE>

<HD>$2.7-Million Ruling Against City Is Overturned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court has thrown out a $2.7-million judgment
against the city of Thousand Oaks stemming from the construction of
the Civic Arts Plaza, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're ecstatic," City Atty. Mark Sellers said. "It's like kicking
a field goal in the Super Bowl in the last minute and winning the
game."</LD>
<LD>   Amelco Electric of Gardena sued the city in 1996, claiming that
city officials and consultants made so many last-minute changes to
the plans for the plaza that costs for the project rose more than $2
million.</LD>
<TE>   By the time the plaza opened in 1994, the city had paid Amelco
$7.2 million for its work, but denied the company's claim that it had
done more work than the original contract called for.</TE>
<TE>   A jury ruled that Amelco was owed $2.7 million in cost overruns
and interest. The city appealed, but the judgment was upheld by a
state appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   In the Supreme Court's ruling, it noted that Amelco waited until
January 1995, a year after the project was completed, before
submitting its claim.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the high court stated that Amelco was fully aware of the
risks and strict regulations inherent in the bidding process when
dealing with a public agency.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Grows Old Before Angels' Eyes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM BARRERO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ramon Ortiz, considered to be among the Angels' best up-and-coming
young pitchers, is a little more seasoned than the club previously
thought.</LD>
<LD>   After encountering visa problems in his native Dominican Republic
last week, it was revealed that Ortiz is three years older than he
claimed.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-throwing right-hander, who the team believed was going to
turn 26 on March 23, actually will be 29. He provided the team with a
fraudulent birth certificate when he was signed as a free agent in
June 1995, Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said.</LD>
<TE>   The age on Ortiz's passport matches the age on that document,
according to Stoneman.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of being the youngest component in a probable
opening-day starting rotation also including Aaron Sele (31), Kevin
Appier (34), Jarrod Washburn (27) and Scott Schoeneweis (28), Ortiz
now slips into the middle..</TE>
<TE>   But Stoneman said the revelation will have no effect on how the
team--or at least the front office--will treat Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to take a lot of ribbing from his teammates, that's
for sure," Stoneman said, "but in terms of how we look at him, we're
a performance business, so how he does between the white lines will
answer any questions from players or fans and the way he will be
perceived."</TE>
<TE>   The delay in processing Ortiz's visa probably won't prevent him
from arriving on time when pitchers and catchers report to spring
training in Tempe, Ariz., on Feb. 15, Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said he found out about the problem from Pat Roache,
Ortiz's Boston-based agent. He said Ortiz called Roache last week
when Immigration and Naturalization Service officials at the U.S.
consulate in Santo Domingo discovered that Ortiz's passport had a
different birth date than his official birth certificate.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, 13-11 with a 4.36 earned-run average last season, is still
in the Dominican Republic, and could not be reached for comment.
Roache, Ortiz's agent for only the last two years, did not return a
telephone message.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I understand, he's just going to have to get a new
Dominican passport that matches what his official birth certificate
says," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Gomez, a former Angel scout who signed Ortiz--then thought to
be 19--in 1995, said he had no idea the 6-foot, 170-pound pitcher was
older than reported.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a surprise to me," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me a birth certificate, I signed it and sent it to the
commissioner's office."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said Ortiz probably changed his age to make himself more
attractive to major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The American teams like players to be 17 and 18 when they're
prospects," Gomez said. "A director of scouting doesn't like to sign
players who are 21 or 22. Maybe that's why some Dominican players
change their birth certificates."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks probably had a
lot do with government officials discovering the discrepancy in
Ortiz's documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to 9-11, this might not have been something they would have
uncovered," Stoneman said. "The government is scrutinizing anyone who
wants to come into the U.S. more than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said the incident won't change the way the Angels verify
the ages of potential prospects from foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball now has an office in Santo Domingo, which
Stoneman said has helped limit the number of cases in the Dominican
Republic that go unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   "Players are starting to realize that if they fib about their age,
they may not get away with it anymore," he said.</TE>

19.</TE>

<TE>   * Television analyst: The Lakers' Stu Lantz, a four-time winner in
radio, won for the second time in a row in television.</TE>

<HD>Power Is Transferring to Westchester</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bo Corona has been coaching at Westchester for 13 years, and this
season he has received a real lesson in chemistry.</LD>
<LD>   Three transfer students--Brittany Grant from Playa del Rey St.
Bernard, Ashley Harrison from L.A. Hamilton and Roneisha Williams,
who sat out last season at Harbor City Narbonne--have played this
season for Westchester. The influx of new personalities hammered the
Comets' group dynamic.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been my most difficult year as a coach," Corona said. "But
being a challenge, I think we worked much harder as a staff."</LD>
<TE>   Corona said personnel issues that concerned him at the beginning
of the season and got in the way of his team reaching its potential
are nearly resolved. He credited the players and an unlikely source
for getting everyone on the same page.</TE>
<TE>   A post on an Internet bulletin board that called the Comets
"uninspired finger-pointers" got the attention of the players.
Williams, Shayna Stanley and Dominique Everage called a team meeting
after a 59-49 victory over Venice on Jan. 9 to discuss the critique.</TE>
<TE>   "They digested it, broke it down, asked if it was true or were
they better than what was written about them," Corona said. "They
asked, 'Where's our pride?' These kids want respect."</TE>
<TE>   And since then, Westchester has been more cohesive.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not finished by any stretch of the imagination, but our
chemistry is 100% better," Corona said. "We're about 85% of where we
should be. They're starting to accept their roles, believe in each
other, respect each other, and play hard together.</TE>
<TE>   "Win or lose, we're going to be a team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brrrrr: Inclement weather caused Apple Valley's game at Rim of the
World last week to be postponed from Tuesday to Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Snow closed the Rim of the World campus in Lake Arrowhead and
school administrators wouldn't allow any activities on campus,
including practice.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of makes it hard to prepare for the most important game
of the year," Rim of the World Coach Karen Rudolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Valley won, 53-43.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twister: West Hills Chaminade's Christina Zdenek, whose driving,
left-handed layup in traffic is usually accompanied by some strange
twisting of her body, may have an inherent advantage over other
players. She has gymnastics in her genes.</TE>
<TE>   "Her dad, Gene, was a gymnast at [Woodland Hills] Taft High, and
she is definitely very flexible," said Zdenek's coach, Kelly DiMuro.
"She can twist her body around, get in between players. Most of her
shots look like she's got a bad angle because of the way she contorts
her body."</TE>
<TE>   Zdenek, a junior with three seasons of varsity experience, has
already set the school's career scoring record with 1,187 points. A
5-foot-8 point guard, she is averaging 21.8 points this season.
Chaminade is 16-7, 7-1 and in a first-place tie in the Mission
League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pioneer melodrama: Lauren Ervin, the 6-3 junior center for
Artesia, will apparently decide this week whether to finish the
season with the fifth-ranked Pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   Ervin did not play in Artesia's three victories last week because
her mother wanted her to prepare for final exams, according to Coach
Scott Roczey. He said a decision will probably be made by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staying put: Guard Megan Aaker, who led Laguna Hills to a Southern
Section Division II-AA title as a sophomore, and forward Kristin
Thawley, who led Irvine to a Division I-AA championship game
appearance last season, have suffered through senior years in which
the playoffs weren't a given.</TE>
<TE>   The only way both can qualify for the playoffs this season is if
Laguna Hills beats Aliso Niguel tonight, Irvine beats Laguna Hills on
Thursday, and Woodbridge beats Aliso Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Both will attend UC Irvine next season. Jim Martin, Laguna Hills
coach, said both benefited by not transferring to other schools.</TE>
<TE>   "[Aaker] has come along so far as a rebounder, and Thawley has
gone from a post-up player to one that can play on the perimeter," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaker is averaging 19.7 points, 7.8 rebounds, three assists, 1.5
blocks and two steals. Thawley is averaging 23.8 points, 12.8
rebounds and 3.8 assists.</TE>

<HD>Hinrich Works His Magic in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Hinrich heard the chants of "Har-ry Pot-ter!" every time he
stepped to the free-throw line at Manhattan, Kan.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas' skinny, dark-haired junior swingman is getting used to
that. What's important to Hinrich is that he didn't give Kansas
State's fans any reason to mock his game.</LD>
<LD>   Hinrich made all 10 of his free-throw attempts and scored 26
points Monday night as No. 2 Kansas beat Kansas State, 98-71, in a
game marred by four technical fouls and the ejection of Wildcat Coach
Jim Wooldridge.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Boschee added 16 points, and Nick Collison and Drew Gooden
each had 15 for Kansas, 20-2 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12
Conference. The Jayhawks won for the 19th consecutive time in
Manhattan and have never lost in Bramlage Coliseum, the Wildcats'
home since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's last home victory over the Jayhawks came on Jan.
29, 1983, in Ahearn Fieldhouse, and the Wildcats last beat
Kansas--then ranked No. 1--68-64 on Jan. 17, 1994, in Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all the media wants to talk about, but we don't talk about
it all that much," Hinrich said. "Coach [Roy Williams] does bring it
up before every game here--but he just says, 'It's got to end
sometime, but let's try to extend it one more year.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State (9-11, 3-6), which upset then-No. 9 Oklahoma State,
70-61, on Saturday, has never beaten two top 10 teams in a row. The
Wildcats haven't beaten ranked teams in consecutive games since
defeating Oregon State (No. 2) and Illinois (No. 19) in the 1981 NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Wooldridge drew two technical fouls and was ejected with 11:21
left when he stepped on the court to protest a basket by Collison,
who appeared to travel on the play. No call was made.</TE>
<TE>   "The officiating was fine," Wooldridge said. "It wasn't a
combination of things. There was one play I was upset about, and I
reacted."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Syracuse 76, West Virginia 64--Preston Shumpert scored 20
points, and Josh Pace tied a career high with 12 points for the
Orangemen in a Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The win ended a two-game losing streak for the Orangemen (18-6,
7-3), who have not lost three in a row since the 1995-96 season. West
Virginia (8-13, 1-8) lost for the 11th time in 12 games despite the
return of Coach Gale Catlett, who sat out the last two games because
of a viral infection.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountaineers made a game of it even though they committed 27
turnovers and trailed 38-21 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 North Carolina 93, Florida State 63--Nikki Teasley had 22
points in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Coretta Brown added 18 points for North Carolina (17-6, 7-4),
which has won three consecutive games since Teasley moved to point
guard. Genesi Choice scored 14 points for Florida State (11-11, 2-9),
which has lost five in a row and nine of 10.</TE>

<LD>UCLA (6-15) at Long Beach State (10-9), 7:30, KACD (850), KEWS
(1350)--The Bruins and 49ers take a break from Pacific 10 and Big
West play for a final nonconference game. Long Beach State has lost
the last two meetings between the teams, including last year's 86-60
decision at Pauley Pavilion. This will be the Bruins' first visit to
Long Beach since 1987.</LD>

<LD>Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel had plenty of journalistic
company in predicting the St. Louis Rams would rout the New England
Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI--but he got carried away by his own
hyperbole: "How in the name of Vince Lombardi did the Patriots get to
the Super Bowl? This is like a Shetland Pony advancing to the
Kentucky Derby. This is like a '67 Dodge Dart advancing to the
Daytona 500....</LD>
<LD>   "The Rams are football's exciting and electrifying future; the
Patriots are its dull and dreary past. The Rams are Britney Spears
and the Pats are Ethel Merman."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the Super Bowl record for the longest field
goal?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crushed: The 20-17 loss to the Patriots was devastating for the
Rams as articulated by Ram defensive end Grant Wistrom to Joe Strauss
in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:</TE>
<TE>   "The whole season is a waste now. I don't care what anybody else
says. [Forget] 17-2 [their record if they had won]. We lost the
football game; we lost the world championship."</TE>
<TE>   There, there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where was he? Patriot linebacker Roman Phifer, a former UCLA and
Ram standout, was surprised that Ram running back Marshall Faulk had
only 17 carries (only five in the second half) for 76 yards:</TE>
<TE>   "We thought he would be a bigger part of the game plan. We knew we
had to know where he was at all times.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to have guys near him. You try to have guys hit him. Why
they didn't use him, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Confession: Mark Purdy in the San Jose Mercury News: "All right,
so those of us who predicted the St. Louis Rams would win the Super
Bowl by 100 points were wrong. We weren't alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Before kickoff, the only people who truly expected the New
England Patriots to win were their coaches, relatives, friends, and
perhaps the ghost of Paul Revere's offensive coordinator."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whew! We didn't hear him: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "If ABC had broadcast the game, Dennis Miller would have
said: 'This was the biggest upset since the Athenians beat the
Persians at Marathon, or since Susan Lucci won an Emmy.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be careful: Green Bay safety LeRoy Butler, explaining the
guidelines set by then-Packer coach Mike Holmgren during their week
in New Orleans before Super Bowl XXXI: "He said: 'If you're going to
chase girls, make sure it's a girl.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1960, Bill Russell of the Boston
Celtics set an NBA record with 51 rebounds against Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't last long as it was broken on Nov. 24 by Wilt
Chamberlain, who had 55 for Philadelphia against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Steve Christie of Buffalo, 54 yards, against Dallas
in Super Bowl XXVIII.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle offered his
take on Laker Coach Phil Jackson telling President Bush during a
White House visit that "I want to say this group showed the country
and NBA basketball how to work together as a group. And I only hope
that you and Congress can do as much."</TE>
<TE>   Feigen wrote: "The Secret Service then wrestled Jackson's ego to
the ground."</TE>

<HD>It's No Ordinary Sequel for Brooks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is about the past, all right, but not the past you had in mind.</LD>
<LD>   You think Herb Brooks came back to coach the U.S. men's Olympic
hockey team because he's stuck in nostalgia mode, because he can't
move past those incredible days in Lake Placid in 1980 when he led a
bunch of college kids past the Soviets and on to what might be the
most memorable gold-medal victory in U.S. history?</LD>
<LD>   If you do, you're wrong.</LD>
<TE>   This has as much to do with 1960 as it does 1980. This goes back
to the Games in Squaw Valley, when the United States won its first
gold medal in hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Back to when Herb Brooks had to watch, as the last man cut from
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Back to when he heard his father tell him the team's success meant
that Coach Jack Riley must have cut the right guy.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very defining moment in my life, as far as
goal-setting and defining some of my value systems and things that
are important to me," Brooks said. "I think we can all look back on
our life and find a similar moment--[words from a] grandfather,
grandmother, teacher, neighbor, whatever--that added to things that
we think are very important in our life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when that happened to me, the lesson my father [taught]
me was you don't know what's going to happen in the future. We just
don't know. The thing that he was telling me at the time was whatever
you're going to do, you have to make some sacrifices. If you take
that alone and spin out all the connotations that that phrase means,
then it adds up to determination, attitude, paying the price, ability
to rebound and come back. A lot of things come out of that.</TE>
<TE>   "I got no sympathy from my father."</TE>
<TE>   He did get the same first name as his father. And he got an
attitude from him, one that helped Brooks come back and make the
Olympic teams in 1964 and 1968 (although the United States did not
win any medals those years.)</TE>
<TE>   He coached the University of Minnesota to three national
championships in the 1970s. He coached four NHL teams in the 1980s
and '90s. He was enshrined in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame
12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup, hockey's
highest honor.</TE>
<TE>   But he was a big part of something that went beyond any single
sport. "I give him almost all the credit for what happened in Lake
Placid," said Ken Morrow, a defenseman on the 1980 team. "I felt I
was as well prepared as I've ever been to do anything under Herb's
guidance. Without him, we wouldn't have won."</TE>
<TE>   They won because Brooks gave them the same tough love he received
from his father. He told the best college hockey players in the
United States that they weren't good enough to win, so that way they
played above their perceived capacity. He ran grueling practices.</TE>
<TE>   Team captain Mike Eruzione considers Brooks a friend now, but, "At
the time he wasn't, because he was the coach. He had to do what he
had to do."</TE>
<TE>   The team was together for only six months, but in that time it
played 63 games before the Olympics. Brooks sought out the best
competition, including a matchup with the Soviets that left the
Americans on the wrong side of a 10-3 score just before the Olympics
began.</TE>
<TE>   "What I think people forget is Herb took this team and didn't do
the chicken banquet tour," 1980 goaltender Jim Craig said. "He didn't
just play college teams that he knew he could beat."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks' camp was "an accelerated class on 'How do I get the most
out of each individual?'" Craig said. "It's almost like [when] you
have these CEOs and they want to unify them, so they send them out to
Pecos River for rafting."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brooks: "I tried to get them out of a comfort zone."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted them to go where he had been, to make them understand
about hardship and sacrifice and the high cost of victory. So he made
them suffer.</TE>
<TE>   The training was when Brooks made them into winners, defenseman
John O'Callahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think once we got to Lake Placid, all he had to do was stand
back and open the door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Games, the second time the Olympics have featured
NHL players, will require a different approach. Brooks will have his
team together for only one full practice between the time the league
begins its Olympic break and the first U.S. game.</TE>
<TE>   And the players present a different dynamic. They're pros, and
some of them are close to the current ages of the 1980 U.S. hockey
team members.</TE>
<TE>   So here are the glaring questions surrounding Brooks: Why scale
the mountain again when he already has reached the highest peak? And
can his coaching style work with this new scenario, or will he seem
as outdated as the loud jackets he wore behind the bench in 1980 look
now?</TE>
<TE>   First, the why.</TE>
<TE>   "Number 1, I was asked," Brooks said. "The Olympic Games are
special. The competitiveness is something you look forward to. It's a
thrill to represent your country in the Olympic Games. That would be
another reason. And I really look forward to working with the
athletes that we have."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks coached the Penguins as recently as the 1999-2000 season,
and he continues to work for them as a scout, so he is familiar with
the NHL players.</TE>
<TE>   Several phone calls from Neil Sheehy, a member of the USA Hockey
executive committee and a fellow Minnesota resident, were enough to
convince Brooks to try again. "They pressed my button," Brooks said.
"They asked for some help."</TE>
<TE>   "We think he's the best person out there to coach this team in
this type of circumstance, the short time frame, six-seven games,"
said Craig Patrick, the general manager for Team USA. "He's got a
great mind. He really wants to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim Craig: "I think what people miss is that Herb Brooks is a
tremendous bench coach. There are people who are great coaches and
preparers. It's almost like a football coach, these football coaches
go in at halftime and readjust. In hockey you don't have halftimes.
You have to be a good bench coach. Herbie does that as good as
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks says he likes the personalities on this new team, and he
wants them to be expressive, for the players to be the show. (In 1980
he didn't let his players talk to the media).</TE>
<TE>   And as much as he hates today's psychobabble and how it makes
people soft, it sure sounds as if he wants the 2002 players to get in
touch with their inner child.</TE>
<TE>   "The pros we have right now have a lot of little boy in them,"
Brooks said. "They might be the stars of the National Hockey League,
but they have a little boy."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's how he can make this work. He doesn't face the
staggering odds he did in 1980. The United States has a fair shot in
this tournament, as do Canada, Russia, Sweden, Finland and the Czech
Republic. But maybe his troops will be inspired and taken back to
good memories by the mere sight of Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing comes to mind: watching him jump up and down and him
getting hugged by the trainer in the 1980 Olympics up in Lake
Placid," said Philadelphia Flyer Jeremy Roenick, who will skate for
the U.S. in Salt Lake. "That's the one thing that's embedded in all
American kids' minds. I look forward to hearing a lot of his stories.
I'm sure he's going to tell a lot of stories from that time and the
things that they did to get over that hump."</TE>
<TE>   There it is. The past again. Lake Placid simply won't go away.</TE>
<TE>   But you know what? Neither will Brooks, who is 64 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has a passion," Eruzione said. "Obviously he can still
coach. He's so competitive, he'd like to give it a shot again and see
if he can do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he's playing with house money now.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they win or lose, it's not going to affect what happened
in 1980," Eruzione said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not out to prove anything to anybody," Craig said. "He's not
out trying to get a job in the NHL, not trying to advance his career.
He's got all his diplomas."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks knows the question is out there.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say, 'Why go back and compete when you won it
before?'" he said. "That's never entered my mind. And if it does, it
would be sort of a sign of maybe a lack of conviction on my part.
Nobody's ever hit 1.000. Babe Ruth sure didn't."</TE>
<TE>   So he doesn't worry about trying to surpass Ruth or even his own
status in the collective conscience of a nation's sports fans. He
worries about meeting the standards set by his father.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks has no time for a society of blamers who feel that nothing
should tamper with a person's self-esteem. Would Brooks be a failure
if he didn't win another gold medal? No, he'd be a failure if he
didn't try.</TE>
<TE>   "My father says, 'Hey go out and do something, accomplish
something,'" Brooks said. "Then you've got a right to feel good about
yourself."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two games away from the All-Star break seemed as good a point as any
for Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry to take stock of his team. He quickly
discounted the notion that this seven-game journey was a
make-or-break trip.</LD>
<LD>   It would have made for a better trip if the Clippers had not
stumbled against Memphis and Atlanta, but a 2-3 record after five
games wasn't bad when considering that the team had only three road
victories before leaving Los Angeles on Jan. 27.</LD>
<LD>   "The bottom line is that when we're playing in the last month of
the season, we're playing the teams we're chasing for a playoff
spot," Gentry said. "It could be a two-game swing if we win. Or a
two-game swing the other way if we lose. For us, it's going to come
down to what we do in the head-to-head games with Seattle, Utah,
Portland and Phoenix."</LD>
<TE>   Gentry has often pointed out that the Lakers, Sacramento Kings,
Dallas Mavericks, Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs have
all but locked up playoff spots.</TE>
<TE>   The other teams are fighting for one of the remaining three
positions in the hyper-competitive Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "How well we finish up will probably depend on how we play at
home," Gentry said. "We have been much better at home than on the
road."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have won 19 of 27 games at Staples Center.</TE>

because of a torn muscle and a bone bruise in his right hip. Knick
Coach Don Chaney said after Sunday's loss to the Miami Heat that the
team is hoping to trade for a big man to replace Camby. If that
doesn't happen, the Knicks will seek help elsewhere, possibly by
signing Olden Polynice or Otis Thorpe. The Clippers and Knicks have
each lost two games in a row.</TE>

<HD>No Place Quite Like Peekskill for Brand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEEKSKILL, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>All Ruth Torres wanted was a hug. A swarm of wide-eyed schoolkids
hoped for a handshake. Others simply wanted to be nearby. Everybody,
it seemed, wanted something from Clipper power forward Elton Brand,
and he was only too happy to oblige Monday.</LD>
<LD>   After all, this was his night at Peekskill High. The governor
lauded him. The mayor presented him with a key to the city. The
varsity basketball coach retired his jersey at halftime of
Peekskill's game against Beacon.</LD>
<LD>   Through it all, Brand smiled warmly, shaking hands, posing for
photographs and answering questions from former classmates, teachers
and current students at the high school he led to two state
championships in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<TE>   To all, he is the same Elton Brand he has always been, a good kid
who made it to the NBA the right way--through hard work, perseverance
and with the solid foundation this town of 20,000, located some 30
miles north of New York City, provided him.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope you continue to inspire all of us to live better lives,"
New York Gov. George Pataki  told Brand and a crowd of more than
2,000 squeezed into the high school's gym.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki, also a graduate of Peekskill High, added: "I have known
him and his family since he was 4. My daughter, Emily, and Elton went
to school together from kindergarten on up. He played Santa Claus
once in a Christmas play, and Emily was Mrs. Claus."</TE>
<TE>   Others told similar stories, little bits of history that made them
glow with pride.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, who has taught Spanish for 20 years, recalled Brand as one
who took his studies as seriously as he did his accomplishments on
the basketball court. Although hefinished 10th in his senior class,
he struggled in Spanish III.</TE>
<TE>   "But he got an 89 on his final, and I said, 'Elton what
happened?'" Torres said. "He said, 'I did what I had to do.' You
know, everything they say about him in the media is true. He's so
polite, so well-spoken. The support he had here was very instrumental
in his success."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Torres got a hug, an autograph and a red Clipper cap.</TE>
<TE>   "He grew up in Dunbar Heights [a public housing complex] on the
other side of town, and he did a lot to bring this town together in
the mid-1990s," said Vinnie Vesce, a former Peekskill mayor. "Pataki
was elected governor, and two months later we won the state
championship [in 1995]. A couple of weeks later, he had about 350
people, including Elton and the basketball team, up at the governor's
mansion in Albany."</TE>
<TE>   Memories flooded over Brand as a five-minute videotape, featuring
his play at Peekskill, Duke and with the Clippers, was shown on a
giant screen wheeled onto the basketball court during the halftime
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Peekskill shaped me as a person," he said, flashing another of
his megawatt smiles. "It is important to be a good overall person and
not just a good basketball player."</TE>

merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,

<LD>   What: NBA Courtside 2002 video game</LD>
<LD>   Publisher: Nintendo</LD>
<TE>   Developer: Left Field Productions</TE>
<TE>   Price: $49.95</TE>
<TE>   Video games are getting more and more realistic, and this new one
is another example. To help make it authentic, Kobe Bryant donned a
suit with sensors and served as model for real NBA players, spending
two six-hour sessions in a studio.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles of the Clippers also were used
as models.</TE>
<TE>   A Nintendo GameCube, priced at $199, is needed to play this game,
which features high-polygon 3-D models of virtually every player in
the NBA. You pick the teams and the players. Up to four people, using
separate controllers, can play.</TE>
<TE>   A new "adrenaline button" enhances shooting, dunking, blocking
shots, dribbling and passing.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest difference with this game is the level of passing. You
can dribble and pass in any direction on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial intelligence is programmed into the game, so if
Shaquille O'Neal is your player, you need to be more careful with
your passes than if, say, Allen Iverson is your player. And if O'Neal
goes to the free-throw line, well ...</TE>
<TE>   Another feature enables participants to create and customize
players.</TE>
<TE>   Each game includes commentary from the Clippers' Ralph Lawler and
Fox Sports Net's Van Earl Wright, and public address announcing from
the Lakers' Lawrence Tanter.</TE>

<HD>Disney May Be Showing Interest Again</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck General Manager Pierre Gauthier met with players last
week in an attempt to reassure them of Disney's commitment to the
team, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has had the Ducks on the market for several months, but has
found no buyers, several sources have said. But Gauthier told players
that company officials intend to become more involved with the Ducks,
who have fallen from being a playoff team in 1998-99 to probably
missing the postseason for the third consecutive year.The Ducks, who
have won five consecutive games, are 14th out of 15 conference teams
this season.</LD>
<LD>   Gauthier's rare meeting with players came in the wake of trade
rumors. In what seemed like a white-flag moment, Gauthier has
indicated to other teams he is willing to trade 10 players in the
organization, including six currently with the Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   Players declined to comment about the meeting or the trade
speculation. Gauthier did not return phone calls Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were founded in 1993 and were as much a personal venture
as a business decision by Disney CEO Michael Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   But Eisner, who once took trips with the team, has been a rare
visitor at the Pond in recent seasons. He has repeatedly refused to
comment on the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Players have been left to defend their absentee owner.</TE>
<TE>   When asked earlier this season about Eisner's seemingly diminished
interest, team captain Paul Kariya said: "He's a huge hockey fan and
always has been and always will be. Even when he's in Europe, the
Internet is always there and he's watching games and keeping up with
it."</TE>
<TE>   But Eisner has made only cameo appearances at the Pond and one
drop-by visit, after a game against the New York Rangers at Madison
Square Garden this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael came down to talk to us after the game in New York to
reiterate his feelings about the team and the importance of the team
in the overall picture of Disney," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we're just like a minute speck in the stuff they have.
But we're in the papers every day. He reiterated our importance to
the Walt Disney Company."</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei has decided not to play one game for his
native Belarus in the Olympic preliminary round, which begins
Saturday. Salei had intended on playing in the Monday game against
France, but changed his mind after talking with Belarus team
officials.</TE>
<TE>   If Salei played in that game, Belarus would have to play the two
other qualifying games with one fewer player. Rosters for the three
preliminary games can not be changed.</TE>
<TE>   Salei said he would play if Belarus made Olympic final-round play,
which begins Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks went through a semi-intense practice Monday, which had
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky and left wing Mike Leclerc coming to blows
during a drill in front of the net. The two exchanged shoves and had
to be restrained by teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a game situation and we were battling," Tverdovsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Leclerc: "That's just hockey, hitting guys, taking some
hits."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya, who played in Saturday's All-Star game, did not practice
for a second consecutive day. Coach Bryan Murray said he gave Kariya
permission to work out on his own Monday.</TE>

<HD>IOC Shelves New Ethics Guidelines</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Anger aimed at conflict-of-interest measures that
were prompted by scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>In the city where the worst corruption scandal in Olympic history
erupted, the International Olympic Committee on Monday postponed
enactment of conflict-of-interest rules as resentment over the
imposition of ethical guidelines bubbled up in the IOC's general
assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Only two days after being adopted by the IOC's policy-making
executive board, the rules were shelved after members complained they
were confusing and would create a paperwork jungle for an entity yet
to emerge fully from the Salt Lake bid scandal, which surfaced in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   Most called for revisions or a thorough review of the rules. But
Tay Wilson of New Zealand said there was no need for the rules
whatsoever.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed that we have so little confidence in ourselves
that we need an ethics commission to tell us how to act," Wilson said
in the IOC's assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Sinan Erdem of Turkey, meanwhile, offered a revealing look at a
sentiment sparked by the scandal--and the IOC's response, a 50-point
reform plan enacted in December 1999, that bans visits by members to
cities bidding to be host of the Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Banning the visits is not a good thing for future Olympic Games
and causes lots of problems," he said. "Just the same as banning the
gifts. All the people in this room," meaning the IOC delegates,
"should be free to accept or reject gifts. But we should not be
treated as schoolchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Most U.S. companies and government agencies, even nonprofit
institutions of a certain size, maintain clearly defined, written
rules detailing conflicts of interests that must be reported.</TE>
<TE>   The rules the IOC executive board had approved would have required
all IOC members and staff, along with counterparts in most other
Olympic agencies, to list potential conflicts of interest with the
ethics commission--a panel created after the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Members found to have conflicts of interest they did not disclose
could have been reprimanded or suspended.</TE>
<TE>   President Jacques Rogge, elected last year to an eight-year term
and presiding over his first IOC assembly, said the
conflict-of-interest rules would be withdrawn for more study and
submitted to a special session scheduled for Mexico City in November
at which the full 50-point reform plan is due to be revisited.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Canadian IOC member Dick Pound, the chairman of the World
Anti-Doping Agency, called on international track and field officials
to expel the U.S. track federation for failing to disclose the names
of athletes who had tested positive for illicit performance-enhancing
substances.</TE>
<TE>   . U.S. officials have long denied any cover-up but could not be
reached Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * The chairman of the IOC team monitoring preparations for the
2004 Summer Games in Athens, Swiss member Denis Oswald, said
organizers are still shy nearly 3,000 hotel rooms for officials,
sponsors and the press.</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed concern about construction due to begin on
Olympic facilities at the site of the old Athens airport, saying
planes are still using the airport. He observed, "You cannot start
the construction as long as the airplanes are flying the [runway]."</TE>
<TE>   Oswald's comments were similar to those he made on an inspection
trip only a few weeks ago to Athens. He reiterated Monday that the
Games will be "under time pressure" until they begin.</TE>
<TE>   Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, head of the Athens 2004 organizing
committee, said, "Our pace continues to accelerate." She said also,
"We are aware that time is short. We Greeks like to wait for the last
minute."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers, Ishii Still Far Apart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers tried to bridge their negotiating gap with Kazuhisa Ishii
by adding two option years to a three-year offer to the Japanese
left-hander Monday, but their revised proposal didn't make much of an
impression on Ishii's agent, Joe Urbon, who is growing more
pessimistic about Ishii's chances of signing with the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a good effort, but nothing we'd consider," Urbon said. "We
have to get the [guaranteed portion] of the contract up to speed
before we talk about any option years."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers won Ishii's negotiating rights by posting an
$11.26-million bid with the Yakult Swallows, Ishii's Japanese team,
in early January, but they will lose those rights unless they sign
Ishii by 9 p.m. PST Friday. The Dodgers won't have to pay Yakult the
$11.26 million if they don't secure the pitcher.</LD>
<TE>   "The next 48 hours are crucial," Urbon said. "We need to determine
whether this is going to happen, because Ishii needs to cross the
Pacific Ocean and get a physical [before he signs]. I imagine the
Dodgers aren't going to pay $11.26 million to Yakult until they're
sure Ishii passes a physical."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers on Monday came up slightly from their three-year,
$8-million offer, but Urbon is seeking a deal comparable to the
Swallows' last offer to Ishii, a five-year deal that guaranteed more
than $17 million. Urbon faxed Dodger General Manager Dan Evans a
document summarizing recent negotiations between Yakult and Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is unclear whether the Yakult offer will remain on the
table if Ishii can't come to terms with the Dodgers, or whether Ishii
would even want to sign a long-term deal in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii would become a free agent in Japan after 2002 and could sign
with any major league team next year, so if he doesn't sign with the
Dodgers but wants to play in the U.S. in 2003, he would sign a
one-year deal with Yakult for 2002. This has muddled the negotiating
picture for the Dodgers, who aren't sure if they are competing
against a five-year offer from Yakult or a possible one-year offer.</TE>

<LD>The Kings' climb to near the top of the Pacific Division standings
has truly been a team effort. No King ranks among the league's top 65
scorers.</LD>
<LD>   But that's not necessarily ideal, Coach Andy Murray said.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd just as soon have five or six 20-goal scorers if we could,"
said Murray, whose leading scorer, Jason Allison, was tied for 67th
in the NHL with 37 points (12 goals and 25 assists) before Monday
night's games. "I'd love to see us have those kinds of scorers. We
encourage our guys to do that....</LD>
<TE>   "Our game is not one where we restrict anybody in what they're
able to do with the puck. We encourage our guys to be creative."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Murray said, "It's a credit to our team that
we've been able to hang in there without that [kind of production]. I
think some of those guys who [are counted on to score consistently]
could play better for us."</TE>
<TE>   Backup goaltender Jamie Storr, who has played in only one of the
last 11 games since shutting out the New York Rangers on Jan. 9 at
Madison Square Garden, will start Thursday against the Carolina
Hurricanes at Staples Center or Friday against the Coyotes at
Phoenix, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Storr, unbeaten in five starts since Nov. 29, leads the NHL with a
1.89 goals-against average and is tied for third with a .923 save
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Mathieu Schneider, sidelined the last two games because
of a left shoulder strain, is expected to return to the lineup
Thursday night.... Adam Mair was scratched after being recalled from
a weekend stint in the minors. The rookie center played three games
during the All-Star break for the Kings' American Hockey League
affiliate at Manchester, N.H.... Former Mighty Duck winger Ted
Donato, picked up off waivers last week from the New York Islanders,
was scratched. "He's depth at this point," Murray said. "It's a
matter of working himself into the lineup."</TE>

<HD>Kings Fly Out at Home</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Philadelphia gets upper hand in 3-1 victory as L.A.
loses for third time in its last four Staples Center games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home sweet home?</LD>
<LD>   Not for the Kings, whose 3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on
Monday night was their third in their last four games at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, they've won seven of their last eight on the road.</LD>
<TE>   A victory over the Flyers would have moved the Kings within one
point of the first-place San Jose Sharks in the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   But on a night when the Kings saluted their six Olympians in front
of a sellout crowd of 18,118, the Flyers turned in a medal-worthy
performance, never trailing as goaltender Roman Cechmanek turned
aside 20 of 21 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped the Kings to 11-11-3-1 at Staples Center, the
worst home record of the 16 teams currently holding down playoff
positions.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's credit our opponent," King Coach Andy Murray said of the
Flyers. "They played a very, very good road game tonight, and we
didn't play as good at home as we need to to beat a team of that
caliber."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got only a second-period power-play goal from Adam
Deadmarsh while giving up goals to Ruslan Fedotenko, Eric Weinrich
and Simon Gagne, the last putting the game out of the Kings' reach
with 63 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, owners of the league's best road record and the No. 1
overall record in the Eastern Conference, opened a three-game Western
swing by improving their record to 28-0-4 when they score at least
three goals.</TE>
<TE>   They're 17-8-3 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that makes them so formidable, Murray said, is their
size.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty big," he said before the game. "When you see them
step on the ice, they're huge. They're strong. For us to beat them,
it's got to be about speed and quickness and trying to turn up our
transition game and skating hard....</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting: They're the biggest team in the league, but
they're one of the least penalized. As we told our guys, it's not so
much that they're overbearingly tough, but they're very strong, so
we've got to be smart."</TE>
<TE>   The surging Flyers, even hotter than the red-hot Kings over the
last two months with a 21-7-1-1 record in December and January to the
Kings' 18-7-4, got the Kings' attention early.</TE>
<TE>   They outshot the Kings, 9-0, in the first 91/2 minutes, one of the
shots a redirection by Fedotenko of a blast from the blue line by
Weinrich, giving the Flyers a short-handed goal and a 1-0 lead 6
minutes 43 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   With Gagne in the penalty box for hooking, Weinrich gathered the
puck in front of the King bench and fired away. Fedotenko, positioned
in the left faceoff circle, got a piece of the shot, deflecting it
past goaltender Felix Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a big, physical team and they got on us quick," King
winger Kelly Buchberger said. "We were just one step behind, and we
were pretty much there all night. We didn't get a lot of shots or
generate a lot of offense, and when you don't do that you're not
going to win a lot of hockey games.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play them, you've got to play them aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   King rookie Ryan Flinn, dropping his gloves for the fourth time in
five games, showed some aggression later in the first period,
instigating a fight with Todd Fedoruk after the Flyer winger had
checked defenseman Jaroslav Modry.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings seemed to come to life after that, killing the
instigator penalty against Flinn and outshooting the Flyers, 5-0, in
the last seven minutes of the period.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, though, maintained their one-goal advantage until 4:39
of the second period, when Deadmarsh scored his team-leading 17th
goal.</TE>
<TE>   On a three-on-two breakaway, with Flyer Kim Johnsson in the
penalty box, Jason Allison from the right wing fed a pass into the
middle to Ziggy Palffy, who in turn dropped a pass for Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh beat Cechmanek with a quick shot to the short side,
scoring his first goal in seven games and his second in 12.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied for only 50 seconds, however, before the Flyers
took the lead again, Weinrich chasing down a long rebound and scoring
from the left point.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne added the late capper, intercepting a pass from Philippe
Boucher and skating in alone before flipping a backhanded shot past

<HD>No Decision on Rest for O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was examined Monday morning by a UCLA Medical Center
podiatrist who recommended more shoe support and more rest.</LD>
<LD>   Team officials and O'Neal likely will meet today to discuss the
depth of that rest, which could include Wednesday's game against the
Chicago Bulls, Sunday's All-Star game and next Tuesday's game against
the Washington Wizards, or segments of that. O'Neal would attend the
All-Star game, in any case.</LD>
<LD>   No decision has been made, other than to continue to protect
O'Neal's arthritic right big toe, and to devise a better strategy
that might bring him relief from the pain.</LD>
<TE>   In recent weeks, O'Neal increased the size of his shoe, and three
games ago he began to wear a new orthotic device that apparently has
helped.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also takes anti-inflammatory medication, though it upsets
his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   The various problems with his feet--he also had preseason surgery
on the small toe on his left foot--have made O'Neal's season a trying
one, in some respects. He missed five games in late December and
early January on the injured list, he is not as mobile and his lack
of practice time limits his conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in 37 games, O'Neal leads the Lakers in scoring (26.1
points), field-goal percentage (56.7) and rebounding (10.8), this
while often limping to and from the arena.</TE>
<TE>   On that creaky big toe, O'Neal averaged 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds
and 1.8 blocked shots in four games in four arenas, all wins, last
week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you'll recall, Brad Miller was the "bum" and Charles Oakley was
the "has-been," presumably, according to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play the Bulls on Wednesday, 25 days after O'Neal threw
a punch at Miller, shortly after being mugged by Miller and Oakley.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're an all-star and an MVP, I'm a bum compared to him,
probably," Miller told Chicago papers. "But who cares? I've been
called much worse."</TE>
<TE>   Said Oakley: "Why would I care what Shaq says?"</TE>

<HD>Nets Have No Trouble Routing Kings, 117-83</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how Byron Scott tried to modify it, the Sacramento King-New
Jersey Net game was best described with one word.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little 'Wow,'" Scott said after the Nets dealt the Kings
their worst loss of the season Monday night, 117-83, in a matchup of
the top teams from the Eastern and Western Conferences at East
Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little surprised we were beating them like we were
beating them, but our guys were really in tune tonight; they wanted
to play really well against the team that has the best record in the
league," Scott said.</LD>
<TE>   One third-quarter sequence illustrated how the Nets were the
faster and sharper team.</TE>
<TE>   After Sacramento committed a turnover, Jason Kidd took the ball on
the sideline and caught the Kings napping, firing a 70-foot baseball
pass to Keith Van Horn for a layup. Two seconds later, Kerry Kittles
picked off Chris Webber's inbounds pass and calmly sank a
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   The five-point sequence came as part of a 25-8 run to open the
third quarter as the Nets turned a 57-54 halftime advantage into an
82-62 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, playing the second half of a back-to-back set, never
threatened the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 113, Minnesota 83--David Robinson had 13 points and 15
rebounds and seven Spurs scored in double figures at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs played most of the second half without Tim Duncan, who
was ejected along with Minnesota's Kevin Garnett early in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:49 in the third, referee Luis Grillo called a technical on
Garnett after he started yelling at Duncan during some rough play
under the Spur basket. Duncan smiled and was walking away, but he
then turned and said something to Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   Grillo hit him with a technical and ejected both players. There
was no physical contact between the players</TE>
<TE>   Houston 104, Utah 97--Steve Francis made 18 of 22 free-throw
attempts and scored 33 points to lead the Rockets at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Houston led late in the fourth quarter when Utah rallied behind
Karl Malone, who scored seven points in a 9-3 run that gave the Jazz
a 90-89 lead with 4:36 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets answered, as Moochie Norris scored five points in a
7-0 run, and Houston moved out to a 96-90 lead with 2:39 left.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 100, Philadelphia 93--Vince Carter scored 13 of his 28
points in the third quarter at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 36 points for the 76ers, but was ejected
after getting his second technical foul with 6.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Michael and Juanita Jordan are giving their marriage another try.
The Jordans, who announced last month they were divorcing after 12
years of marriage, said they are attempting a reconciliation. Juanita
Jordan also withdrew the divorce petition she filed Jan. 4....
Charlotte guard David Wesley will be out three to four weeks because
of a broken foot.</TE>

<HD>Russell to Plead Not Guilty</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Darrell Russell said Monday the Oakland Raider defensive
tackle will plead not guilty to charges he drugged and raped a woman
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Russell was charged Monday at Alameda with 25 counts relating to
the alleged attack, and is being held in jail in lieu of $1.2-million
bail.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they seized a videotape of the incident during a
search of the house, occupied by Russell's teammate, safety Eric
Johnson, where the victim says the alleged assault occurred early
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the victim, whose name was not released, was tested
for drugs at a hospital the evening after the alleged attack, and no
drugs were found. Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin Murphy said the
prosecution had requested further drug tests and that other evidence
supported those charges.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, 25, appeared in court for the first time and did not say
anything as his lawyer, Anthony W. Gibbs, waived arraignment. Gibbs
said Russell will plead not guilty and seek bail reduction Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, Naeem Perry, 24, of Berkeley, and Ali Hayes, 27, of
Oakland, were in shackles when they appeared in court.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Charger defensive tackle Leonardo Carson faces two
misdemeanor charges for allegedly pulling a gun at a car repair shop
in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Carson, 24, was arrested and charged with harassment and menacing,
said Mobile Police Sgt. John Goodwin. Carson was released on a $1,000
bond.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in Boston withdrew a misdemeanor charge against
suspended New England Patriot receiver Terry Glenn, acknowledging
they do not have enough evidence to try him on charges of assaulting
his ex-girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings asked a court to dismiss the wrongful death
lawsuit filed by the family of Korey Stringer, claiming the team is
protected under the state's Workers' Compensation Act.</TE>
<TE>   Team attorneys called Stringer's heatstroke death Aug. 1 a
"terrible blow" but said it was "clearly, undeniably in the course
and scope of his employment for the Vikings," the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis reported on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Stringer's widow, Kelci, is suing the Vikings for $100 million,
claiming coaches and medical staff did not give Stringer the medical
attention he required.</TE>

<TE>   Miami Coach Larry Coker, who once earned $7,000 per year as a high
school coach, was rewarded for winning the national championship,
receiving a five-year, $5.25-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   Coker, 53, had two years remaining on his previous contract.</TE>
<TE>   Horse Racing</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel has reluctantly sent Labamta Babe, one of
the emerging Kentucky Derby favorites, to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In his first race around two turns, Labamta Babe won the Santa
Catalina Stakes at Santa Anita on Jan. 19, but on Monday morning at
Hollywood Park, swelling in an ankle led to an X-ray that showed that
the 3-year-old colt has a strained suspensory ligament.</TE>
<TE>   Labamta Babe won't race in the Kentucky Derby or the other Triple
Crown events.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel was forced to retire Flute, who won last year's Kentucky
Oaks, because of a chipped ankle. She finished with four wins and
three seconds in eight starts and earnings of $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 4-year-old daughter of Seattle Slew will be bred to a Kentucky
stallion in the next several weeks.</TE>

<KH>ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Patriots' Revolutionary Concept Doesn't Look Like a
Blueprint</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The NFL is a league of copycats. If something works for one team, a
dozen more try it the next season. Dick Vermeil tries to re-create
his St. Louis offense in Kansas City. The Bears sign two condo-sized
defensive tackles to look more like Baltimore. Bill Walsh's offense
is Xeroxed ad nauseam, then adopted by half the teams in the league.</LD>
<LD>   But how on earth are teams going to emulate the New England
Patriots?</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots won the Super Bowl on Sunday with something more than
Xs and O's, something more vague and elusive. They won with hunger.</LD>
<TE>   Long on needs and short on salary-cap space, Coach Bill Belichick
and his staff identified a cluster of players who were talented and
could play as a team, yet weren't household names. In the last two
seasons, they signed 20 of them for a grand total of $9 million, pro
football's version of a yard sale.</TE>
<TE>   These were guys labeled outdated or damaged goods by other teams.
Free agents such as running back Antowain Smith and linebacker Roman
Phifer, guard Mike Compton and defensive end Anthony Pleasant,
linebacker Mike Vrabel and fullback Marc Edwards. The Raiders used to
rekindle the careers of has-beens; the Patriots scoured the bargain
bins for never-weres.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the tough part. Belichick molded the hodgepodge
collection into a team, a unit that, for the first time in Super Bowl
history, sprinted onto the field as one during introductions. Was it
only a year ago that Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis did that
self-aggrandizing dance when his name was announced, grabbing a
handful of grass and rubbing it all over himself? That simply
wouldn't fly with New England.</TE>
<TE>   Delighted as he is to have been named the Super Bowl's most
valuable player, quarterback Tom Brady is still a little
uncomfortable with sudden stardom. He was taking his parents and
sisters to Disney World on Monday, then up to Boston for a parade
today. This is a guy who never wanted to do his weekly news
conferences outside the locker room; he preferred to do them at his
locker so he could be closer to his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Brady was asked Monday if he's prepared for the madness to
come--the magazine covers, the endorsement deals, the intensified
spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on it," he said with a smile. "It's new to me. So I'm
going to just--I'm like a kite in the wind, just kind of going with
the flow."</TE>
<TE>   Some players say the real test for Brady will come this
off-season, when he has a bit of time to think about how good he can
be, or the tenuous nature of fame and popularity. He'll never have to
buy a drink this off-season, at least not in Boston, and the
backslaps will never stop. Can he keep it all from seeping into his
head?</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, he'll try.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much room for improvement," he said, "I don't even
know where to start."</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind, Belichick said he has never seen a player who made
more dramatic strides from his first season to his second.</TE>
<TE>   But Brady is only one example of the Patriot mentality. Smith, a
former first-round pick, was humbled when Buffalo dumped him after
three seasons and realized he had to prove himself again in New
England. He wasn't resentful, just determined.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Willie McGinest, the former USC star and fourth pick
overall, unflinchingly accepted his role as a backup. Receiver Troy
Brown didn't gripe when he was left off the Pro Bowl team, even
though he caught a franchise-record 101 passes. Drew Bledsoe could
have ripped apart the team when he lost his job--probably for
good--because of an injury. Instead, he rooted on Brady.</TE>
<TE>   A pivotal member of New England's front-office brain trust is
Scott Pioli, the player-personnel director and son-in-law of Bill
Parcells. Pioli waited in the locker-room tunnel Sunday night, too
giddy to stand still. He looked sharp in a tan suit, and didn't seem
to mind the new sweat stains he picked up every time he bear-hugged
one of his players. Pioli did a masterful job of identifying and
signing players who fit the mold.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's awfully hard to build a dynasty this way. These
players are low-profile no longer. The Patriots probably will try to
trade Bledsoe, a $107-million backup, to Washington or Chicago. Adam
Vinatieri, who won the Super Bowl with a 48-yard field goal as time
expired, will be an unrestricted free agent this off-season and could
be too costly to re-sign. Same goes for Phifer.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots paid Brady $289,000 this season. Think he'll get a
raise?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to keep the team the way it is," Belichick said. "But,
realistically, I know there's going to be some changes on our team,
just like on everybody else's."</TE>
<TE>   Belichick and Pioli planned to sit down Monday and start talking
about the future, about how they can reshape the roster yet again,
cutting the fat and sparing the core.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly the challenging part of the game," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   And we thought Sunday was tough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NFL Realignment</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of the Houston Texans, the NFL will realign next
season. The South divisions will be composed of teams moved from
other divisions. All North division teams formerly played in the
Central divisions. Seattle will be the only team to switch
conferences. Former divisions are in parentheses; records are from
2001-02 season. Four division winners and two wild-card teams will
qualify for the postseason in each conference. Formerly, three
division winners and three wild-card teams qualified.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings' Hasek Stops Avalanche</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They threw slap shots, backhanders and rebounds at Dominik Hasek, and
even took a shot after the goalie lost his stick.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing got through in the third period, and Hasek's 13 saves
in the frame helped preserve the Detroit Red Wings' 3-1 victory over
the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Wings raised their NHL-best point total to 82.</LD>
<TE>   In the third period, Hasek made a save off a rebound shot by Joe
Sakic, made a pad save on a backhander by Rob Blake and, after losing
his stick, stopped Eric Messier from the slot.</TE>
<TE>   "In the third period, they had some good shots," Hasek said. "But
we played well defensively. We played just the way we needed to."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 8, Columbus 0--Bill Guerin had three goals and an assist at
Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   All the goals were even-strength, with the Bruins on the power
play for only one second of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 4, Phoenix 2--Jan Hlavac and Trevor Linden each had a
goal and an assist at Vancouver, Canada, as the Canucks extended
their unbeaten streak to eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Letowski and Markus Naslund also scored, and Peter Skudra
made 22 saves for the Canucks, 13-3-1-1 since Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver moved into seventh place in the Western Conference, one
point ahead of the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, New York Islanders 6--Dick Tarnstrom scored the tying
goal for the Islanders with 4:16 left in regulation at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Tampa Bay 4--Daniel Alfredsson scored two goals for the
Senators at Tampa, Fla. The Senators are unbeaten in five games
(2-0-3).</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck agreed to terms with New Jersey,
ending a short retirement. Vanbiesbrouck, 38, probably won't sign a
contract with the Devils until after the break for the Olympics is
over.... Tampa Bay left wing Fredrik Modin will be sidelined at least
three weeks because of a right wrist injury.... Martin Gelinas will
miss at least four more games for Carolina because of a concussion.</TE>

<KH>ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Fans Treat Blake Like King Snake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe Rob Blake really did believe that King fans would forget.</LD>
<LD>   It has almost been a year since Blake was traded from Los Angeles
to Colorado and the former King captain seemed a little shocked to be
booed when he returned to Staples Center for two recent visits.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a big difference between fans dogging a player when
he's playing against his ex-teammates and getting jeered every time
he touched the puck in an All-Star game, which happened to Blake on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "I understand because they supported the Kings and I for 12
years," said Blake, who originally was a little bothered by the rough
treatment he received when Colorado played at Staples Center on Jan.
26. "They never cheered for anyone on a different team and I don't
expect them to do that for me."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, the whole situation doesn't make much sense.</TE>
<TE>   Blake shouldn't be upset by the way he has been treated by King
fans because he ended up playing on a Stanley Cup championship team
and then signed a five-year, $48-million contract last summer.</TE>
<TE>   And Staples Center fans shouldn't be so passionate with their
disgust because the Kings are playing good hockey and have become a
legitimate force in the league. Sure Blake is gone, but he gave the
franchise everything he had until he made a business decision.</TE>
<TE>   Blake said the most difficult time he's had since being traded to
the Avalanche was last season's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "That cut everything up and made me realize that I was on a
different team now," Blake said. "It was the best thing but at the
time, I thought it was the worst thing. To come back here and play
your old team in a playoff atmosphere was really tough."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, now firmly established as one of the best defensemen in the
world and a key component on the Canadian Olympic team, seemed to
take the All-Star weekend in stride. He was impressed with the
support fans gave the various events and was glad former King owner
Bruce McNall was able to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Bruce, Wayne [Gretzky] probably wouldn't have been here,"
Blake said. "In 1993 when we got to the Stanley Cup finals, it was
the most exciting time in hockey history here. They together brought
excitement here and because of them, we have teams in Anaheim,
Phoenix and San Jose ... And all that happened because of the success
they had here."</TE>
<TE>   McNall, who owned the Kings and acquired Gretzky in 1988, had been
in federal prison for nearly five years after pleading guilty to two
counts of bank fraud, one count of wire fraud and one count of
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   The New School</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't noticed, the usual names are missing from the
league's list of top scorers. There's no Mario Lemieux or Jaromir
Jagr. Not even Pavel Bure or Teemu Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, there's Jarome Iginla, Markus Naslund and Joe Thornton,
the top three scorers before Monday's games.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I do look at the stats, just not as often as I used to,
but when I do, you can see that the game has changed," said Jagr, who
was tied for 30th in scoring with 45 points at the All-Star break.
"There are a lot of young guys in the league who have been here for
one or two years and they are starting to play like superstars. But
you never know. There are still 28-30 games left. But in my opinion,
if Mario played a whole season, he'd win it."</TE>
<TE>   Because the leading point producers are not scoring at a sizzling
pace, there's still a chance for a player such as Lemieux or Jagr to
make a late run. Which would not be a surprise to Iginla.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to replace those guys for sure but it is fun to
be one of the young guys," Iginla said. "There are a lot of good
young players in the NHL, who are getting better and gaining more
experience. But you have to respect those guys who have done it for
years."</TE>
<TE>   If Lemieux is to rally, he'd better get going soon because he has
only 27 points in 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Tough, but Nice Too</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton's Georges Laraque took time over the All-Star break to
telephone Nashville's roughneck veteran Stu Grimson to wish him well.
Grimson, 36, one of the NHL's most respected and longest-serving
tough guys, hasn't played since a fight with Laraque on Dec. 8.
Grimson, a former Duck and King, sustained a concussion and his
career is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect him," Laraque told the Edmonton Sun. "We talked about
our jobs. I told him I felt bad about what happened. He said, 'Don't
feel bad, it's the job.' I told him I wished it didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, he's been an example of perseverance and
determination. It was good to talk to him. He's a nice guy."</TE>
<TE>   Odd Bedfellows</TE>
<TE>   What makes the NHL so different in an Olympic year is that many
teammates will be harsh competitors in less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   And some heated rivalries, such as Detroit and Colorado, have
changed a little bit. Colorado's Adam Foote and Joe Sakic will be
teammates of Detroit's Brendan Shanahan and Steve Yzerman while
playing for Canada in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   For a team such as the Red Wings, who will have 10 players
competing in the Olympics, this has created some interesting
conversations around the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "The strangest part is that we are working since the beginning of
the season very, very hard to achieve some goals, and we have done
pretty well," said Sergei Fedorov, who along with teammate Igor
Larionov will compete for Russia. "Now we are going to turn around
and compete against one another. There's nothing you can do about
that. It's part of the game. It's not going to be easy, but you have
to just try and be as professional as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman knows his biggest challenge will come
after the Olympics are over.</TE>
<TE>   "We have three guys on the Swedish team, two on the U.S., two on
the Canadian team, two on the Russian team and they are all thinking
the same thing," Bowman said. "They are thinking about the gold
medal. But there is only going to be one group of players that is
going to go home happy. All of the others won't feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   Of all the suggestions to increase scoring in the league that were
heard over the weekend, St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger had the
best idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there are things they can tinker with but if they just
called the rule book that would get it done," Pronger said. "To look
at the hooking and holding and all that stuff in the neutral zone,
that would be a start. There is a lot of hooking and holding going
on."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not bothering me because I am not going through the neutral
zone. I am going to be the guy doing it. You watch other teams doing
it, then you start doing it."</TE>
<TE>   One of the best questions heard over All-Star weekend was one
asked of New York Ranger forward Michael York, who was born on Jan.
3, 1978. A reporter asked York, did the 1980 U.S. Olympic team
inspire him when they won the gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   "No, because I was only 2," York said.</TE>

<HD>Former Coach Faces Embezzlement Charge</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently fired San Bernardino High boys' basketball coach Jesse
Spinner faces one count of felony embezzlement for allegedly
misappropriating money that was supposed to go to the San Bernardino
City Unified School District, an official with the San Bernardino
County District Attorney's Office said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged misappropriation of at least $400 allegedly occurred
between Dec. 17-22, said John Kochis, chief deputy district attorney.
If convicted, Spinner, 35, faces up to three years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Spinner will be arraigned Feb. 28 in San Bernardino Central Court.
His attorney, Dan Greenberg, said the charge is the result of a
misunderstanding and is confident Spinner will be vindicated.
Officials at the school and the school district declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Spinner, a former Crenshaw High player, had a 5-6 record in his
first month at San Bernardino before being fired in January.</TE>

<LD>Although Sunday's down-to-the-wire game was one of the most exciting
Super Bowls, it didn't get a super rating.</LD>
<LD>   Fox's telecast of the New England Patriots' 20-17 victory over the
St. Louis Rams got a 40.4 national rating and a 61 share, the same
numbers as last year's game on CBS, in which the Baltimore Ravens
routed the New York Giants, 34-7.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, only the 1999 Super Bowl, with a 40.2 on Fox, and the
1992 game, with a 40.3 on CBS, drew lower ratings than Sunday's game.
But the proliferation of cable and the Internet has dramatically
affected TV ratings.</LD>
<TE>   The 2000 Super Bowl on ABC drew a 43.2 rating.</TE>
<TE>   However, the estimated U.S. audience of 131.7 million Sunday is
about 500,000 more than last year and is the fifth-highest total for
a program--sports or otherwise--in television history. The top 10
shows on that list are Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the game got a 36.4 rating and a 61 share. Super
Bowl pregame coverage in L.A. got an 8.8 from noon to 2 p.m., a 14.7
from 2-2:30, a 17.3 from 2:30-3, and a 28.0 from 3 p.m. until
kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' game at Dallas on Channel 4 at 11:30 a.m. got a 7.9
and an 18 share in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Viewership was high throughout Fox's game telecast Sunday,
including a 38.3 rating for a halftime show featuring U2. That's
nearly seven times the 5.6 rating NBC got for its attempt at halftime
counter-programming, a special edition of "Fear Factor" featuring
Playboy playmates.</TE>
<TE>   The audience--which advertisers paid Fox an average of just under
$2 million per 30-second commercial to reach--increased every 30
minutes from kickoff until a slight dip at the start of halftime. The
numbers then increased again straight through to the final play, Adam
Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   The national rating peaked at 43.6 from 6:30-7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Boston was the major market with the largest
rating, a 56.1, followed by St. Louis at 52.4. The rating in Chicago
was a 45.1, New York a 37.6.</TE>
<TE>   The show that followed the game on Fox, "Malcolm in the Middle,"
drew an 11.5 rating and 21 share--70% above its average.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose digital video recorder company TiVo monitored the
viewing habits of 10,000 of its 280,000 subscribers and found viewers
replayed the Britney Spears Pepsi commercials more than anything
else.</TE>
<TE>   Of the game action, the winning field goal got the most replay
attention.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Although the Goddess of Pleasure awaits me at home, I have decided to
remain on the East Coast for another week to help these people out.</LD>
<LD>   I know many of you have suggested for some time I make this
journey, and while I don't recall anyone saying "hurry back," I can't
imagine anyone back home thinks my work is done with USC or the
Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   However, ESPN has offered Plaschke and myself the opportunity to
go on national TV this week and inform the world beyond Denver where
the West Coast is located. Many of the dolts here, from what I've
heard, think you need a passport to attend the Winter Games in Salt
Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   Now you will notice ESPN did not extend this national TV
invitation to Barry LeBrock, the blabbermouth host of "The SIMERS
Show," although it's also a mystery to me how they ever heard of
Plaschke.</TE>
<TE>   I would imagine, however, the folks at Fox are scurrying around to
locate our agent to triple our pay to keep pace with ESPN and
maintain their ratings edge on "The Practice" every Sunday night. I
don't think it would be good for a company to have the reputation for
losing Simers, Plaschke and Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   MY FIRST question, of course, was whether the people of Nebraska
get ESPN, because based on my experiences, they don't get much of
anything.</TE>
<TE>   My second question concerned Chris Berman and Dan Patrick, and
whether they were upset because they were going to be replaced by
Plaschke and myself, and apparently I had misunderstood because we
were being asked to take turns filling in for Tony Kornheiser, an
aging, smart-aleck sportswriter, on something called "Pardon the
Interruption." Talk about typecasting.</TE>
<TE>   There's no way the folks in Nebraska will get this--they'll still
be working in the barns when this show comes on in the middle of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kornheiser is losing his hair, ESPN asked Plaschke to go
first to make the transition more seamless, and so he began Monday
working opposite Michael Wilbon, a Washington Post sportswriter like
Kornheiser, and best known for being a really nice guy.</TE>
<TE>   Pardon the interruption--but it's 2:30 p.m. your time, the show
has just come on, and while I thought it was only a rumor that he had
gone to a stylist for a makeover, apparently Plaschke really has gone
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke not only looks good on TV, but you have to be impressed
with the way he worked in a California "thanks, dude" while talking
to guest Sean Salisbury and effectively used the Shaq bobble-head
doll as a prop. You could also see his "Ali" acting techniques at
work, and I think we're going to have a problem calling it just "The
SIMERS Show" in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke waved his hands, raised his voice as if he believed what
he was saying, made outrageous statements for TV ratings such as
calling Mike Martz a wimp, and to be honest--after watching Plaschke,
I wouldn't bring Kornheiser back.</TE>
<TE>   NOW I understand my appearances on the show Thursday and Friday
are going to go nothing like Plaschke's, and I'm doomed for disaster.
You understand, because you know how you felt after reading the first
two Page 2 columns. It's only recently you've cut back on the
obscenities in your e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   When I mention Phil &amp; Jeanie with a knowing smirk on ESPN, you
will know whom and what I am talking about. When I'm asked to discuss
hockey and I appear not to know what I'm talking about, the morons in
Philadelphia will think I'm just being a punk, but you will really
understand I have no idea what I'm talking about. If I mention the
grocery store bagger, you might chuckle, while everyone else thinks I
couldn't remember Kurt Warner's name.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure yet how Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx will translate on TV, but I
would imagine since I'm not allowed to write about the owner of the
Rams, I probably can't talk about her. I'm also guessing when we go
to the part of the show when they spend "five good minutes" with a
guest it won't be with Eric Karros, Mike Garrett or a male figure
skater.</TE>
<TE>   We may not always agree in L.A., but at least you understand,
which will put you ahead of everyone else in the country. It's like
that interview I did with HBO's "Real Sports," when the interviewer
looked me directly in the eye and said, "You never wrote anything
nice about Dodger Boy, did you?"</TE>
<TE>   I think I said something like, "No, no, now that you mention it, I
can't think of a thing," and while you knew that was true, I heard
from people all over the country who thought I had to be kidding. I
hope they don't ask me the same question about Kevin Brown, because
I'll have to answer truthfully again.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting across from a nice guy like Wilbon, what do you think
that's going to make me look like when I treat him the same way I'd
treat someone from USC?</TE>
<TE>   THOSE WHO remember the picture we used to run with the Page 2
column, you know it's not going to be pretty. I thought about buying
a tie, but decided I'll just do what I can to mimic Plaschke, bring
attention to the West Coast sports scene and get a better deal out of
Fox for myself.</TE>
<TE>   For your part, I'd urge you to flood ESPN with phony,
complimentary e-mails, so ESPN runs more West Coast stories and feels
compelled to bring me back east to occasionally relieve the
Washington sportswriters. That will get me out of L.A.--so you'll
only be helping yourselves, and the Goddess of Pleasure, who also
needs a break every so often.</TE>

<HD>Westlake's Top Rusher Has Long Run in Mind</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So many people want to know which college running back Lorenzo Booker
of Ventura St. Bonaventure High is going to choose that the state
rushing record-holder is waiting until Wednesday to announce his
decision--on ESPN.</LD>
<LD>   Running back Jonathan Contos, who set a single-season school
rushing record at Westlake High, scored a perfect 800 on the math
portion of the Scholastic Assessment Test and has never received a
grade less than A, revealed his college choice last December--at the
family dinner table. He chose Harvard. The way these two college
decisions were handled tells plenty about society's obsession with
sports.</LD>
<LD>   Booker deserves praise for overcoming the challenge of proving he
was the nation's best running back despite playing for a small school
that dominated its weak opposition.</LD>
<TE>   He was named Parade magazine's player of the year and is choosing
his college from USC, Washington, Notre Dame and Florida State. His
4.4 40-yard speed and NFL-like cutback skills have fans clamoring to
learn where he'll be playing this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Contos' story is equally compelling.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed for 1,532 yards last season and became Westlake's
all-time rushing leader. He has a 4.56 grade-point average on a scale
in which 4.0 is an A, and he scored 1,470 on his SAT.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, at a combine in Oxnard, Contos lined up to race
Booker in a 40-yard dash. Contos had hurt his hamstring in an earlier
race but badly wanted to test himself against Booker.</TE>
<TE>   Contos won the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to run against Booker," he said. "I got into the block
next to him and did what I had to do. It wasn't something I was
planning on gloating about or telling everyone about. He was the
figurehead of football in Ventura County and one of the best players
in the nation. It was good for personal gratification to know I could
compete with people like him."</TE>
<TE>   Contos, 5 feet 9, 175 pounds, was good enough to receive
recruiting inquiries from Northwestern, Illinois and Stanford. But
even if USC and UCLA had offered a scholarship, he said he would have
turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   "Within the last year or two, I pretty much realized I'm going to
make my living with my mind," he said. "To be able to accomplish what
I want to accomplish, I'm going to have to attend a school like
Harvard. It's a once-in-</TE>
<TE>   a-lifetime opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Harvard, the oldest college in America, with an endowment of $19
billion and six graduates who became presidents, plays NCAA Division
I-AA football and doesn't offer athletic scholarships. Contos'
parents are going to be responsible for $37,000 a year in costs.
Their daughter attends USC. "It's an opportunity that presents itself
once, and you figure out how to do it," said Contos' father, John.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tim Murphy, who guided Harvard to the Ivy League football
championship last season, said he recruits players who Stanford and
Notre Dame like but don't have enough scholarships to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I tell kids is, 'Someday, football is going to end. It
may be at 18, 22 or 32. The bottom line is, with a Harvard degree,
you're going to have opportunities even an outstanding school can't
give you,'" Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Contos, who has family living in Boston, first visited Harvard
when he was 9. He never imagined himself becoming a Harvard student,
but the excitement he felt during a recent return visit left him
convinced he made the right choice.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, it's very empowering, but at times, it's very
intimidating," he said. "When you start thinking about all the
incredible people who have been there, George Washington, the
Kennedys, it's inspiring, exciting but a little scary, and that's the
essence of the school and why it's special. The opportunities are
endless."</TE>
<TE>   Contos doesn't see anything wrong with the media focusing
attention on Booker while largely ignoring his accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a matter of where you fit in," the Westlake player
said. "I believe I can contribute a lot more to a smaller school."</TE>
<TE>   Contos believes sports provide a crucial learning tool when placed
in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sports is an incredible source of discipline," he said.
"Sports really gets you focused and really balances out your life.
It's good to have a sports experience, but then again, I've always
realized sports isn't everything. There's always tomorrow, win or
lose. There's always another chance. I have four more years to win a
championship."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Booker and dozens of other high school seniors from
Southern California will sign letters of intent. Contos won't be one
of them. In the Ivy League, players don't sign letters of intent.</TE>
<TE>   "They get a letter of acceptance," Murphy said. "All we get from
them is word they are coming. It's a handshake. That may seem
ridiculous in this day and age, but I've only had one kid in 200 I
recruited who reneged."</TE>
<TE>   Contos is going to do just fine at Harvard. He can't wait to test
his mind and body.</TE>
<TE>   "I may be going 3,000 miles away, but it is sort of like going
home," he said.</TE>

<HD>Twins Are Feeling Born Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Minnesota Supreme Court's refusal to hear owners'
appeal almost certainly rules out contraction this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins, in danger of being eliminated in major league
baseball's plans for contraction, will almost certainly play at least
one more season in the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal of
a ruling that forces the Twins to fulfill the terms of their lease
and play in their Minneapolis indoor stadium this season. The
decision all but ends Commissioner Bud Selig's hope to eliminate two
low-revenue franchises before baseball's March 31 opener.</LD>
<LD>   Barring a strike or lockout, the Twins will begin their 42nd
season on April 1 at Kansas City and play their home opener April 12
against Detroit. The Twins have played at the Metrodome since 1982.
Bill Lester, executive director of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission--which operates the Metrodome--called Monday's ruling,
"the ultimate nail in the coffin" of contraction.</LD>
<TE>   In the short term, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball would need the unlikely speedy intervention of the U.S.
Supreme Court to overturn the decision by Minnesota's highest court.
Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, said baseball was reviewing the
decision. "The bottom line is, it looks like we're going to be
playing baseball in Minnesota in 2002," said Dave St. Peter, the
Twins' senior vice president of business affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Magnuson, an attorney for major league baseball and the
Twins, issued a statement expressing disappointment over the
decision. "We will be exploring our legal options," Magnuson said.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball
Players Assn., who had filed a grievance to block contraction, said
Monday's decision will keep the major leagues at 30 teams this year.</TE>
<TE>   The players' union grievance claims the contraction vote violated
its labor contract, which expired Nov. 7 but remains in force until
there is a new agreement. Arbitrator Shyam Das has heard 11 days of
testimony and is to resume the hearing today in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we are very pleased that the matter in Minnesota
appears to have been resolved for 2002, which is good news for the
fans," Fehr said. "We can now look forward to spring training and the
continuation of the collective bargaining process."</TE>
<TE>   Denny Hocking, a utility infielder who is the Twins' player
representative, said that in light of Monday's decision he did not
expect contraction to take place this season. "With everything that
has gone on with the injunction and the grievance, you have to sit
there and figure that with the time-frame involved, this would not be
possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners voted Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams, without
specifying which ones. But since last year the Twins and Montreal
Expos were the prime candidates for elimination. The Twins ranked
29th out of 30 major league teams in local revenue last season with
$32 million. The Expos were last with $9.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing baseball would move to eliminate its team, the
Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission sued to force the Twins to
honor their lease, which expires after this season. On Nov. 16,
Hennepin County District Judge Harry Seymour Crump issued an
injunction. On Jan. 22, the Minnesota Court of Appeals, ruling on an
appeal by major league baseball, unanimously upheld Crump's ruling
that the Metrodome's operators could suffer "irreparable harm" if the
Twins bought out the final year of their stadium lease rather than
fielding a team.</TE>
<TE>   Selig still might announce a one-year postponement of the
contraction plan. That decision could accompany approval of the
pending sale of the Florida Marlins to Montreal owner Jeffrey Loria,
after which Selig's office would assume control of the Expos and run
the franchise for the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, baseball owners moved forward with plans to meet Feb.
12--two days before the start of spring training--in the Chicago area
to approve the sales of the Expos and Marlins. The Senate Judiciary
Committee will hold a hearing on baseball's antitrust exemption the
next day, a spokesman for committee chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.)
said Monday.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Like Getting Into Tight Spots</HD>

<LD>Playing tight defense can be a figure of speech, but it's literal to
UCLA Coach Steve Lavin.</LD>
<LD>   The tall, slow Bruins are best when packed in near the basket,
shrinking the lanes and gaps that ballhandlers drive through.</LD>
<LD>   "If we stay tight, we don't allow dribble penetration and limit
post catches," Lavin said.</LD>
<TE>   When UCLA is playing well defensively--like in the 70-48 victory
over Oregon State on Saturday--it is difficult to tell whether the
Bruins are employing a zone or man to man.</TE>
<TE>   "People think we're in a zone, but a lot of times it's a man,"
Lavin said. "We use both in most games."</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, change from one to the other?</TE>
<TE>   "We want to give different looks--even though they look the same,"
Lavin said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Another benefit of tight defense is that more players are around
the basket for rebounds. USC, the Bruins' opponent Wednesday, had a
big edge on the boards Jan. 10, the first time the teams played.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby took offense at Oregon spectators making
disparaging chants about his relationship with his son, NBA guard
Mike Bibby. But the former UCLA guard probably won't have to endure a
similar episode Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a Bruin, or was anyway," said one fan camping outside Pauley
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin finds humor in the frequent barbs directed his way on the
road, but he doesn't want Bruin fans to get personal with Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hope our fans use good judgment in terms of being respectful
and keeping it within the spirit of the game and of the rivalry, but
less of a personal nature," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The one-sided nature of UCLA's games against Oregon (a 29-point
loss) and Oregon State (a 22-point victory) enabled the two guys at
the end of the bench to make rare appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore center John Hoffart and redshirt freshman forward Josiah
Johnson made their first field goals of the season against the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffart, a transfer from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, scored on a
low-post move, was fouled and made the free throw. He also had an
assist on a medium-range jump shot by Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'd like to get that basket when the game is still
being decided, but it's always good to get in there," Hoffart said.
"This year I didn't expect much playing time, but with so many
seniors I think I'll have an opportunity next year."</TE>

<HD>Bluthenthal Is Frustrated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Bluthenthal, enduring an up-and-down season, acknowledged
Monday that his senior year as a Trojan has been his most
exasperating campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "My freshman year was frustrating, but I was a freshman. I
accepted it and I learned a lot," said the small forward, who left
USC's 73-69 loss at Oregon Saturday without speaking to reporters
after going two for 11 from the field and missing a potential
game-winning three-point shot with four seconds to play. "But this
year is definitely the most frustrating.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's all mental. I've worked just as hard all year. I've
worked a little bit harder as of late. What I've learned this year is
how much of the game is mental. I never realized that until this
year."</LD>
<TE>   Bluthenthal is averaging 11 points, his lowest since he was a
freshman, and shooting 39.4% (worst of his career) from the field,
including 39.5% from beyond the three-point stripe. He averaged 13.5
points last season while shooting 47.2% from the field and 40.9% on
three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tougher this year because I don't get the looks that I had
last year," Bluthenthal said. "I'm not averaging a lot of points, but
I still think that teams are keying on me a little because they know
that I can shoot it well.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I just need to get more movement, and I think offensively
it's tough to get a lot of movement when we do run certain offenses
that are geared toward just filling certain areas. It's not like I
can just roam about. I just need to continue to stay positive."</TE>
<TE>   USC's bench will have two more players available Wednesday as the
Trojans go for their first season sweep of UCLA since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Derrick Craven (personal reasons) and sophomore
forward Jerry Dupree (paternal grandfather's funeral) missed the
Oregon State and Oregon games, but each is ready if needed. "It made
me get back on focus," Dupree said of missing the trip. "I had time
to think what I need to do to get in the game and play more, what the
coaches expect."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree said he had been willing to fly to Oregon to join the team
for Saturday's game. "They just wanted me to stay home and get my
mind right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Craven doesn't expect to play against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   USC fell four places, to No. 24, in the coaches' poll, and from
No. 23 to 25 in the Associated Press rankings. Among the five ranked
Pacific 10 Conference teams, the Trojans are the lowest rated in
either poll.</TE>

<HD>Scott Sassa in Talks to Leave NBC, Sources Say</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC Entertainment's top West Coast executive, Scott Sassa, is
negotiating to leave the network, according to NBC sources.</LD>
<LD>   Although neither NBC nor Sassa would comment on his plans, NBC's
West Coast president reportedly will step down in June, after the
network announces its fall lineup of shows. Sassa has overseen the
network's prime-time shows for three years, with Jeff Zucker, NBC's
entertainment chief, reporting to him.</LD>
<LD>   Rumors of Sassa's pending departure began circulating last year
when Andrew Lack, former president of NBC News, was promoted over him
to be network president. Sassa's lack of appetite for unscripted TV
series and his reliance on more-expensive sitcoms and dramas has
slowed the network's efforts to cut costs.</LD>
<TE>   "Reality" shows such as "Survivor" have been key to the rise of
CBS, a unit of Viacom Inc., which now is locked with General Electric
Co.'s NBC in a race for first place in this season's ratings.</TE>

<LD>Kmart Corp., the largest retailer ever to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization, hired Rockwood Gemini Advisors to guide
the company in the financial review of its real estate assets.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
Eastern Division, approved the hiring of Rockwood Gemini last week,
said Dan McNulty, president of New York-based Rockwood Realty
Associates. A Kmart spokesman, Jack Ferry, confirmed the hiring.</LD>
<LD>   Troy, Mich.-based Kmart said last week it expects to reveal on
March 20 which stores it will close. Analysts have said Kmart may
shutter as many as 500 of its more than 2,100 stores.</LD>
<TE>   Rockwood Gemini is a venture between Rockwood Realty and Gemini
Realty Advisors that helps companies in the sale and restructuring of
real estate assets.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for Chapter 11 protection in Chicago last month.</TE>

<HD>Cessna Reported Stolen at Whiteman Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Owner suspects expensive on-board electronics
attracted thief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A private plane was reported stolen Monday from Whiteman Airport in
Pacoima, although it was probably taken last week, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the 1972 Cessna 172M, owned by Lamar Moon of
Simi Valley, was stolen between 5 p.m. Wednesday and 3 p.m. Thursday,
when another pilot noticed it missing from the airfield, said Lt.
Richard Ackerman of the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill
Station.</LD>
<LD>   Moon, 61, said he had not used his pilot's license for 30 years
before buying the plane in 1996. The four-seat, single-engine plane
is often used to train new pilots.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Moon said, he bought a quarter share in a newer plane
and had been trying to sell the Cessna, which had a for-sale sign
taped to its side window.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Cessna was definitely my baby," Moon said. "I made it
such a pretty little plane, and it gave me the chance to feel free
whenever I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   He estimated the plane, painted white with a red stripe and the
identification number N61602 on the side, to be worth about $50,000
because of the small fortune he spent on electronic instruments.</TE>
<TE>   That equipment probably lured the thief, Moon said, noting that
more than 600 other planes are parked at Whiteman.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody goes for joy rides in a 172," said Homayoun Jandaghi,
owner of Allied Services, a Simi Valley airplane parts shop. "That's
like stealing an antique Volkswagen bug--good for learning to drive,
not for going fast."</TE>
<TE>   Airport Manager Patricia Etherington said the control tower is
closed at night and pilots do not have to report when they leave.</TE>

<HD>2 Teenagers Arrested in Vandalism Spree</HD>
<DH>Crime: The boys are accused of defacing dozens of
businesses in the West Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming a victory for graffiti-cleanup efforts, Los Angeles police
and public officials announced the arrest Monday of two teenagers
accused of defacing dozens of businesses in the west San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The two 17-year-old boys were booked on suspicion of felony
vandalism and released to their parents. The district attorney will
decide whether to file criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Police Det. Todd Henkel said the boys had defaced more
than 50 businesses since September, including restaurants, nail
salons and a pet food store in Canoga Park, using spray paint and
glass-etching liquid. The suspects were arrested after a tip from
school police, Henkel said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives found more than 200 cans of spray paint at the home of
one of the boys, but the most severe damage was caused by the etching
liquid, Henkel said. The material ruins storefront windows, which
cost hundreds of dollars apiece, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests, made under the city's graffiti-removal effort called
Operation Clean Sweep, were announced at a news conference at the
LAPD's West Valley Division. Councilman Dennis Zine, officials from
the city attorney's office, and Los Angeles Unified School District
police attended.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Clean Sweep began in 1987 with $500,000 and now has an
annual budget of about $6.3 million citywide, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy City Atty. Terree Bowers said his office would
evaluate the arrests to determine whether more aggressive legal
action should be taken against the parents of teenagers accused of
vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers said prosecutors could file criminal charges against
parents, such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor. But, he
said, there would be exceptions for hardship or situations in which
parents could not control their teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "For parents who think tagging is an exercise of artistic freedom,
we want them to be clear there is a price to be paid, literally,"
Bowers said. "Parents who negligently supervise their children could
also be held responsible."</TE>

<HD>CSUN to Try Housing Lottery</HD>
<DH>Education: Officials say the plan is fairer to new
students, but the policy angers returnees worried about off-campus
rents.</DH>

<LD>Students living in Cal State Northridge dormitories will not be
guaranteed a room next fall, when the university will begin using a
lottery to assign campus living space, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The change reflects a growing demand for dorm rooms among new
students, the officials said. The lottery will give incoming students
a more proportional share of the campus' 1,740 dorm beds.</LD>
<LD>   That means about 150 of the 700 students returning in the fall
could end up without a room, and possibly face steeper rents.</LD>
<TE>   The news angered students such as junior Kacey Borders, who has
lived in the dorms since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair," said Borders, 20. "All of a sudden I have to
worry about where I am going to live next year. That's all I've been
thinking about since class started. I can't even focus on school."</TE>
<TE>   The glut in CSUN dorm applications mirrors a housing crunch at
several other Cal State campuses, which traditionally have been
commuter schools.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of students at the 23 Cal State campuses live in dorms,
according to system spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler. Systemwide
enrollment has increased about 45,000 since 1997 to nearly 389,000.
Several campuses plan to build more dorms, Bentley-Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   At CSUN, enrollment fell after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but
has climbed steadily in recent years. It is now 31,450, up from
27,650 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Dorm applications exceed the number of rooms by 500 students, said
Tim Trevan, director of CSUN's residence program.</TE>
<TE>   "It evens the playing field," Trevan said of the lottery. "In the
past, we weren't able to fill the dorms. Now we're filling them and
growing every year."</TE>
<TE>   Monthly rents for CSUN dorm apartments are $360 per student for
two bedrooms and $600 for one bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Trevan said his department will help find off-campus apartments
for students left out by the lottery. The university has no plans to
build more rooms, but that could change if the demand persists, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   David Bellamy, a junior, said he cannot afford to live off campus.</TE>
<TE>   "The students who live here already really need to live here,"
said the 22-year-old video production major. "Northridge students are
not wealthy students."</TE>
<TE>   The lottery will reserve 550 spaces for returning students, and
1,190 for incoming students.</TE>
<TE>   Dorm policies vary among Cal State campuses. At San Diego State,
returning students are given first choice of dorm spaces, said Pat
Kroncky, residence director. She said nearly all the 800 students who
applied unsuccessfully were new to the campus.</TE>
<TE>   At Cal State Fullerton, there is a dorm waiting list of 400
students. Most returning students have no trouble getting one of the
385 spaces, and the campus will add 440 spaces next year, according
to Adrienne Franklin of the campus housing office.</TE>

<LD>LOS ANGELES</LD>
<LD>   Child welfare workers cannot decide on their own not to visit some
foster children, an appeals court decided.</LD>
<LD>   Alliance for Children's Rights, a child advocacy group, had sued
the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services saying the
agency's policy of waiving visitation for 6,800 foster children every
month violated state law.</LD>
<TE>   The presiding county juvenile court judge agreed, ruling a year
ago that the county needed judicial approval in each case. The county
appealed that decision to the 2nd District Court of Appeals, which
upheld the ruling on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "DCFS was abusing the waivers--which are supposed to be
exceptions," said Andrew Bridge, of the Alliance for Children's
Rights.</TE>

<HD>Judge Tosses Out Indictment From 2000 Grand Jury</HD>
<DH>Courts: Santa Barbara jurist says the panel, selected by
Ventura County judges, was too male-dominated. The decision could
affect four murder cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Barbara judge has thrown out the indictment of an accused
murderer after ruling that the 2000-2001 Ventura County Grand Jury
was too male-dominated and not reflective of the county's population.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could affect three other murder indictments handed
down by the same grand jury and a drug-and-racketeering indictment
against local Hells Angels members and their associates.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling comes from a Santa Barbara County judge because Ventura
County's 24 judges hand pick the grand jury. Attorneys said they hope
the decision will result in an overhaul of that selection process,
viewed by some as antiquated and unrepresentative of women and
minorities.</LD>
<TE>   "The ruling essentially recognized the fact that the grand jury
has been predominantly old, white and male for many years and does
not reflect a fair cross-section of Ventura County," said Deputy
Public Defender Brian Vogel, who brought a motion challenging the
grand jury on behalf of his client, Michael Schultz.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury indicted Schultz, 32, on murder charges in October
2000. Prosecutors allege he raped and strangled Port Hueneme resident
Cynthia Burger, 44, at her home in 1993. They are seeking the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection was scheduled to begin this week. But the ruling
late Friday by Superior Court Judge Frank J. Ochoa effectively kicks
the case back to the arraignment stage.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Ventura County prosecutors said they would not appeal
Ochoa's ruling but will proceed to a preliminary hearing for Schultz.
The hearing is set for Feb. 14.</TE>
<TE>   "Without conceding that the decision from the Santa Barbara court
was factually and legally correct, we have decided not to seek review
of Judge Ochoa's decision," Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We have previously alerted both the Board of Supervisors and the
Superior Court of our concerns over the method of impaneling the
grand jury," he said. "We will work with the board and the court to
revise the grand jury process in future criminal indictment
proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, volunteers apply to serve on the grand jury and
are selected by county judges for a one-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Only 49 people applied to serve on the 19-member Ventura County
Grand Jury in 2000. Of those, 38 were white and 13 were female.</TE>
<TE>   In a 30-page ruling, Ochoa concluded that the grand jury pool did
not represent a fair cross-section of the community as required by
state and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he found that while women constituted 51.1% of the
county's jury-eligible population, they represented only 26.5% of the
grand jury pool. And Ochoa found the disparity was not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   "The disparate representation of women in Ventura's grand jury
pool was consistent throughout a five-year period," Ochoa wrote.
"From 1995 to 2000, there were a total of 333 grand jury pool members
in Ventura. Only 99 of 333 were women."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa found there was no intentional discrimination. He cited the
jury commissioner's testimony from a December hearing about efforts
made to get a more representative jury pool, including soliciting
names from women's and Latino organizations.</TE>
<TE>   But he found the grand jury selection system "defective"
nonetheless and ordered Schultz's indictment set aside.</TE>
<TE>   "Although this exclusion was not purposeful," he wrote, "it was
the result of an improper feature of the jury-selection process."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Schultz, the 2000-2001 grand jury indicted skinhead
gang members David Ziesmer and Michael Bridgeford, and their friend,
Bridget Callahan, on murder charges for allegedly stabbing a
17-year-old Ventura girl to death in October 1998. Prosecutors are
seeking the death penalty against the two men.</TE>
<TE>   The same grand jury also indicted Hells Angels leader George
Christie Jr. and nine Hells Angels members and associates whose cases
are pending in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village defense attorney Richard Loftus, who represents
Ziesmer and one of the indicted Hells Angels members, said he intends
to review Ochoa's ruling and decide how to proceed.</TE>

<LD>BUENA PARK</LD>
<LD>   State investigators said Monday they are trying to negotiate the
surrender of a dentist accused with two co-defendants in a scheme to
swindle $200,000 from Medi-Cal. An arrest warrant has been issued for
Mehmet S. Giz, a licensed dentist who worked for $300 a day at the
Knott Dental Care clinic in Buena Park before it closed in May 2001.
Authorities said Giz is in Turkey and that they are in phone contact
with him.</LD>
<LD>   Former billing clerk Margaret L. Chaves, 47, of Whittier and Giz,
83, formerly of Rosemead, are charged with three counts each of grand
theft, filing false information with a government agency and
fraudulently billing Medi-Cal.</LD>

<LD>   More than 140,000 sample ballot pamphlets for the March 5 election
were printed incorrectly for the Orange County Board of Supervisors
race between incumbent Cynthia P. Coad and challenger Chris Norby, a
Fullerton City Council member.</LD>
<LD>   Coad's and Norby's names were reversed on the ballot, giving Norby
a slight edge because his name appears first. Incumbents should be
listed first.</LD>
<TE>   Coad's husband, Tom Coad, who is her campaign manager, said
Registrar of Voters Rosalyn Lever's office apologized. "Obviously,
we're disappointed with this but we feel it's not worth the added
expense of making the taxpayers pay for reprinting the sample ballot
pamphlets," he said.</TE>

Huntington Harbour, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sunset Aquatic Marina and Portofino Cove are closed to swimmers

<TE>   "We've asked that people stay out of the water," said Larry

bank robbers suspected in 17 heists.</LD>

<LD>   A judge denied a defense request to postpone the triple-murder
trial of accused Yosemite killer Cary Stayner, but agreed to
reconsider the decision next week.</LD>
<LD>   Stayner, 40, could face the death penalty if convicted of
murdering Carole Sund, 42, and her daughter, Juli, 15, of Eureka, and
family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, of Argentina, who disappeared
while visiting the national park in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   One of Stayner's attorneys, Marcia Morrissey, sought to have the
trial postponed from Feb. 25 until at least May, saying she and
another attorney have not had enough time to review the evidence.</TE>

<HD>Loans to Businesses Tightened</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried about the economy, banks made loans harder to get for
businesses and for many consumers from November through January, the
Federal Reserve Board said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Lending standards generally remained unchanged, however, for
consumers who were buying or refinancing homes, according to the
survey of senior loan officers.</LD>
<LD>   The survey showed that 45% of banks tightened credit for
businesses with $50 million or more in annual sales, and 42% did so
for companies with sales under $50 million a year. None had eased
credit standards for businesses. The loan officers cited a "less
favorable or more uncertain economic outlook" as the main reason for
tightening credit.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened in
the first full quarter after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Fed
found, as businesses cut back investments in plants and equipment and
called off mergers and buyouts.</TE>
<TE>   About one in six banks also tightened standards for credit card
and other consumer loans, except for mortgages. Of the 55 domestic
banks surveyed, one reported it tightened mortgage-lending standards
''somewhat,'' while the rest were unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   A Fed survey of foreign banks with branches and agencies in the
United State found even greater caution among loan officers. Among
the foreign banks, the percentage that had tightened standards for
U.S. customers seeking commercial and industrial loans rose to 70% in
January from 64% in October.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. banks were still tightening credit for businesses,
the rate at which they were doing so had slowed since the Fed's last
survey, which covered the August-October quarter. At that time, with
the memories of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks still
fresh, 51% had tightened lending to larger companies, compared with
45% in the latest report.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Budget Opts for Debt to Fund War</HD>
<DH>Government: President relies on deficit spending in a $2.1-trillion
plan that pours resources into anti-terrorism efforts while asking for
new tax cuts worth $590 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush submitted a $2.1-trillion budget Monday that sets
aside debt reduction and squeezes domestic programs to finance homeland
security, the war on terrorism and another round of big tax cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting Reaganesque fiscal priorities, Bush's budget for fiscal
year 2003 asks Congress for new tax cuts worth $590 billion and defense
spending increases totaling $550 billion over the next 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   He would accomplish those objectives by forgoing balanced budgets for
at least three years and abandoning last year's pledge to reserve Social
Security surpluses to pay off the national debt.</LD>
<TE>   For that, the president offered no apologies. Sept. 11 was the Pearl
Harbor of his generation, Bush said, and the challenges it presents call
for a different kind of fiscal strategy from a knee-jerk aversion to red
ink.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget for 2003 is much more than a tabulation of numbers," Bush
said in his budget message to Congress. "It is a plan to fight a war we
did not seek, but a war we are determined to win."</TE>
<TE>   The president will also have to battle lawmakers, lobbyists and
constituents whose budget priorities differ from his. The first shots
were fired almost immediately, with critics accusing Bush of endangering
Social Security by pressing for new spending and tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "This budget allocates funds to buy bombs, guns and aircraft to help
fight the war on terrorism, but it puts the financial security of
millions of Americans in jeopardy," said Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.).
"This 'bomb now, pay later' approach is fiscally irresponsible." Bush's
second budget reflects a remarkable reordering of fiscal priorities in
response to the terrorist attacks and the deepening recession. A year
ago, the White House said the federal government would accumulate a
$5.6-trillion surplus over 10 years. Bush's new budget slashes the
10-year surplus estimate to $1 trillion. Taking Social Security surpluses
off the table would produce a $1.5-trillion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Physically, the Bush budget book displays some new features. Printed
on glossy paper, it is full of color pictures. It sports reader-friendly
boxes; one asks readers if they would fund a parking facility at the
National Institutes of Health headquarters over sanitation facilities for
Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The deficits that Bush projected are relatively new. He estimated that
the government would end this year $106 billion in the hole, the first
deficit since 1997. The revenue shortfall would shrink to $80 billion
next year and $14 billion in 2004, with surpluses projected from that
point forward.</TE>
<TE>   White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. defended the
revival of deficit spending after four years of pay-as-you-go government.
He said the United States was waging a "two-front war" against terrorism,
at home and abroad, and the anticipated deficits would be the smallest
ever during a recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Running large surpluses and paying down debt is a very important
objective in this administration," Daniels said. "It is simply the case
that at the moment, there are two or three things that come ahead of even
that goal."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Republicans quickly endorsed the president's priorities.
"This is not necessarily a budget for bookkeepers, it is a budget for
security and victory," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the
Budget Committee's ranking Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats served notice that they intended to arm their version of the
budget with a "trigger" mechanism that would stop tax cuts and spending
increases if deficits ballooned. They said they were likely to give Bush
all he wanted for defense and homeland security, but were reluctant on
more tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging," said
Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.).</TE>
<TE>Biggest Defense Boost Since Reagan Era</TE>
<TE>   Bush's 2003 spending plan, the first presidential budget to top $2
trillion, projects $1.2 trillion in mandatory spending next year on
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs over
which Congress and the president have little year-to-year control. The
wrangling is reserved for tax policy and discretionary spending subject
to Congress' annual appropriation process on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's budget proposes $773 billion in discretionary spending next
year, an 8% increase. But much of the increase is earmarked for the
defense budget, which would jump 9% to $379 billion in the fiscal year
that begins in October, and homeland security, which would nearly double
to $38 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The defense spending increase would be the biggest in 20 years, Bush
said. It would launch a long-term military buildup reminiscent of the big
defense budgets of the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   In another reprise of the Reagan years, Bush is asking Congress to
pile $590 billion in tax reductions on top of the 10-year, $1.3-trillion
tax-cut plan enacted last year. Some of the tax relief, an estimated $65
billion next year, is billed as short-term economic stimulus to fight the
recession. The biggest cuts would come in 2011 and 2012, in the form of
extensions of last year's individual income tax reductions beyond their
scheduled expiration in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The president's budget priorities "seem Reaganesque to me, having
lived through that era," said Brookings Institution fellow Alice Rivlin,
who served as President Clinton's budget director. "More defense, tax
cuts and less domestic."</TE>
<TE>   Overall discretionary spending outside of defense and homeland
security would rise 2% next year under Bush's budget; the increase is
barely enough to keep pace with an inflation rate forecast at 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Bush proposed outright cuts in some programs. Federal highway outlays
would fall by $8.5 billion under an automatic funding formula that the
administration does not intend to offset.</TE>
<TE>   Big budgetary blows would fall on the Labor Department, where a number
of job programs are targeted for reduction; the Environmental Protection
Agency, which would receive less money for clean air and water programs,
and the Army Corps of Engineers, which the administration says has taken
on projects that depart from its mission of aiding navigation and
minimizing floods.</TE>
<TE>   Even within agencies whose overall budgets would increase, funding
would be reduced for programs given failing marks under a performance
review system inaugurated by the administration. "When objective measures
reveal that government programs are not succeeding, those programs should
be reinvented, redirected or retired," Bush said in his message to
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Among the targets of Bush's budget scalpel are the special projects,
characterized by some critics as pork, that are added to appropriations
bills by members of Congress. The time-honored practice "has gotten out
of hand," Daniels said. "We now have entire programs of the federal
government for which every penny has been earmarked for somebody's pet
project."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's budget proposes significant funding increases for a few favored
programs outside of defense and homeland security. It sets aside $190
billion over 10 years for improved Medicare benefits, including limited
prescription drug coverage for retirees. It would boost outlays for
selected health and education programs, and reserve $74 billion over 10
years for agriculture subsidies sought by farm-state lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Democrats criticized Bush for submitting a budget
that goes into deficit for the first time in four years, but offered no
suggestions about how to bring it back into the black.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, their reactions suggested they would support policies that
would make the deficit even bigger. While supporting Bush's increases in
defense and homeland security, Democrats opposed offsetting cuts in
highway, environmental and other domestic programs, and insisted they
would not seek a tax increase or rollback of last year's tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us understand our first obligation is to defend this nation,"
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.). "The
president is going to get the resources he requests for national defense
and homeland security."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans called the spending plan a "wartime budget" that reflects
broad consensus that Congress should provide whatever money is needed to
shore up the nation's defense and secure its homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some Republicans say they will scrutinize and possibly
reorder priorities in Bush's big defense and homeland security budgets.
Congress is expected to be particularly reluctant to grant Bush's request
for a $10-billion contingency fund unless Congress has more input into
how the money would be spent.</TE>
<TE>   As his budget began taking fire from the left and right in Washington,
Bush flew to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida's Panhandle, where he
received a hero's welcome as he touted his military spending plan.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing several thousand troops and their families in a gigantic
hangar, the president won rousing cheers when he cited the proposed
$48-billion defense budget increase, which includes a substantial pay
raise for military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in a brown leather bomber jacket, Bush demanded that Congress
make passage of the Pentagon budget its "No. 1 priority."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the president travels to Pittsburgh to promote the $11 billion
his budget earmarks for bioterrorism defenses.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush is scheduled to return to lower Manhattan to tour a
New York police communications center to emphasize his budget priorities
for "first-responders" to terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Budget Highlights</TE>
<TE>Taxes</TE>
<TE>Bush is proposing $590 billion in tax cuts over 10 years to promote
goals ranging from helping people pay health insurance premiums to
subsidizing children who flee failing schools. Many of the new cuts
would take effect in 2003 and 2004. In addition, Bush's budget would
make all of the 2001 tax changes, many of which expire in 2010,
permanent. Several proposals are aimed at fostering charitable
giving. One would allow taxpayers who don't itemize deductions to
deduct a limited amount in charitable contributions. Teachers would
be able to deduct out-of-pocket costs of setting up their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>Health</TE>
<TE>Bush's budget completes a campaign started by former President
Clinton: doubling the National Institutes of Health budget over five
years. Bush would boost NIH outlays to $24.3 billion, an increase of
$3.7 billion. Nearly half of the increase would go to bioterrorism
research, a sixfold bump over current funding and a shift in the
traditional practice of raising outlays for all the  institutes by
about the same level. The National Cancer Institute, up 13%, also
would get a disproportionate share of the  additional funds. The
budget for Medicare would grow 5.7% per year from 2003 to 2012.</TE>
<TE>Transportation</TE>
<TE>Homeland security gets top billing in Bush's transportation budget.
The spending plan includes a $4.8-billion request for a new
Transportation Security Administration that is taking over airport
security, and the largest increase ever in Coast Guard funding, from
$5.6 billion to $7.1 billion. But behind the numbers lies
considerable uncertainty. Officials said the funding request for the
security agency is only a preliminary estimate, and millions more may
be required.</TE>
<TE>Environment</TE>
<TE>Bush proposes slicing $300 million from funds Congress gave the
Environmental Protection Agency this year, much of the money coming
from clean-and safe-water programs. The EPA said the agency was
merely trimming congressional earmarked projects that didn't align
with the administration's priorities. But environmentalists and their
allies in Congress said the funding was needed. The budget also calls
for deep cuts in funding for the Army Corps of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>Energy</TE>
<TE>Bush is seeking $21.9 billion for the Energy Department, an increase
of $580 million. Funding for nuclear security and other national
security programs would increase, as well as programs for
environmental cleanup and management. The department proposes to
accelerate the cleanup of weapons-testing sites, as well as the
consolidation of nuclear waste and materials.</TE>
<TE>Foreign Policy</TE>
<TE>The administration is seeking an increase of $1.4 billion, or 6%, for
the State Department. Most of the money would be used, directly or
indirectly, in the war against Terrorists. About $3.6 billion is
earmarked as economic and military aid to U.S. allies in the
anti-terrorism fight. A big increase would go to Jordan, which would
receive $123 million in military aid and $100 million in economic
aid for its cooperation in the war.</TE>
<TE>Welfare</TE>
<TE>Welfare spending, which stirred a heated partisan battle not long
ago, would remain at about current levels under the Bush budget plan.
The central element in the welfare program--a $16.5-billion grant to
the states--would remain largely intact after Congress reevaluated
welfare reform this year, according to the White House plan.</TE>

<DH>In effort to balance federal land use, wild horses are being
rounded up to give cattle more grazing room. A lawsuit challenges that
strategy.</DH>

<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPRING VALLEY, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>The whisper quiet of the snowy valley was broken by the distant
flutter of an approaching helicopter. Flying 15 feet above the pinyon,
juniper and sage, it weaved and bobbed, herding a dozen wild horses
toward a holding pen.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot wrangled the mustangs, snorting and whinnying, toward
capture. Their coats gleamed with sweat; plumes of steam blew out of
their nostrils.</LD>
<LD>   As the horses approached the pen, partially hidden behind a rocky
knoll, a cowboy on a nearby hillside swatted his Judas horse into action.
It galloped ahead of the pack, and the wild horses instinctively followed
the traitorous lead through a wide jute-fenced chute. The horses
hesitated in confusion. The helicopter hovered menacingly low, scaring
them forward, and they reluctantly trotted into containment.</LD>
<TE>   The chopper pilot returned to the far reaches of the valley, looking
for more animals. Eventually, 710 horses would be captured during this
two-week-long, government-sponsored roundup to reduce the mustang
population in Nevada's eastern high desert. Most will be put up for
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Such roundups landed the Bureau of Land Management in court last year
over its strategy to solve a problem unique to the West: How to referee
the use of 262 million acres of public lands between wild horses and
commercial cattle, which compete for the same forage.</TE>
<TE>   Wild horses are among the West's most romantic and enduring
legacies--offspring of castoffs from cowboys and Indians, miners and
ranchers, pioneering settlers and the Pony Express. The future of the
herds is jeopardized, horse advocates argue, by commercial cattle
grazing, which depletes precious desert vegetation. They also complain
that cattle fences block the horses from roaming freely.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers argue that they provide a valuable commodity--food for the
table--and that if horses are allowed to overrun public lands, they will
consume the cattle's feed to the roots, promoting destructive erosion and
noxious weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Horse lovers have long been critical of the BLM's roundups, which are
conducted year round except during the spring foaling season, contending
that smaller herds will bring less genetic diversity. The BLM announced
in October 2000 a three-year campaign to capture nearly half the wild
horses--much to the delight of cattlemen. Animal groups responded in
September with a lawsuit challenging the herd reductions. A federal judge
in Washington is expected to rule this summer on whether the BLM's
roundups are justified.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM says it's in a politically no-win situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Every special interest group wants to maximize its ability to use
public lands," said Bud Cribley, the BLM's senior wild horse and burro
specialist in Washington. "The BLM is sitting in the middle . . . and
trying to make fair decisions on who gets to use what. It's tricky."</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 feral horses and burros roam in 209 herds from New Mexico
to Oregon, with half of the animals in Nevada. The horses can increase by
25% every year, doubling their population every three years.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM wants to reduce the mustang population by 2004 to fewer than
27,000 animals, to save forage and save money with fewer horses to
capture and put up for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had announced plans to capture 13,000 horses this
year--double the average taken in past years. The lawsuit, filed by the
Fund for Animals and the Animal Legal Defense Fund, halted those plans.
Last month, a federal judge in Denver gave the BLM permission to hold the
Spring Valley roundup as the last of the big ones, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>Some Horses May End Up at Slaughterhouses</TE>
<TE>   The BLM will cull ailing and older horses from the 710 captured and
send them to pastures the agency leases in Kansas and Oklahoma. Only
about 195 horses--those with less adoption appeal--will be set free
again. The majority--the most attractive, younger, healthy ones with nice
coloring--will be put up for adoption. A few may end up illegally at
slaughterhouses, destined for dinner tables in Europe or Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "The BLM is taking an aggressive [roundup] approach . . . for no good
reason," said Howard Crystal, a Washington attorney representing the
pro-horse litigants. "The BLM is not taking a hard look at what else can
be done to protect the range land."</TE>
<TE>   The options, he said, include giving horses contraceptive shots to
prevent pregnancies for one to two years, limiting the number of cattle
grazing on public lands and allowing predators to thin the herds.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers applaud the BLM for preserving forage for their cattle, which
in areas like this consume 10 times as much feed as the mustangs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the feeling the American public believes the horses were
always out there and we moved in on them and took their feed away," said
Steve Boies, president of the Nevada Cattleman's Assn. "Well, the
government asked us to settle this land . . . and they've given us
grazing rights. There's still room for horses, but they need to be
managed."</TE>
<TE>   Such decisions--allocating how many and which kinds of animals can
graze in the desert--are made at regional BLM offices, where the cattle
industry has proved an effective lobbying group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's semi-science, semi-politics," said Jared Bybee, a BLM wild horse
and burro specialist overseeing the roundup in Spring Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Lococo, a regional coordinator for the Fund for Animals,
complains that, unlike cattlemen, horse advocates are unable to lobby at
each BLM office. "We'd be running ourselves ragged, keeping track of
every decision that impacts horses."</TE>
<TE>   The Wild West never encountered such bureaucracy. For 150 years and
with no oversight, cowboys and ranchers caught horses and burros--some
for work chores, most for market. By some estimates, a million or more of
the animals roamed the West around 1900; since then, untold numbers have
perished from drought, harsh winters or depleted forage due to
overpopulation.</TE>
<TE>   "My own grandfather would work 50 horses during the summer, to help
run cattle, pull wagons and for other work," said Boies. "When he was
done with them in the fall, he'd open the gate and they'd head for the
mountains."</TE>
<TE>1971 Act Charged BLM With Protecting Herds</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1950s, the horses found a passionate supporter in Velma
Johnston. Known as Wild Horse Annie, the Reno woman was angered by the
wholesale slaughter of mustangs and rallied public opinion to save the
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Her campaign led Congress in 1971 to pass the Wild Free-Roaming Horse
and Burro Act. It assigned the BLM the job of protecting the herds,
declaring the animals "living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit
of the West."</TE>
<TE>   Cowboys could no longer capture wild horses at their whim. In finding
that the animals "contribute to the diversity of life forms within the
nation," Congress ordered them "protected from capture, branding,
harassment or death . . . as an integral part of the natural system of
the public lands."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, about 60,000 horses and burros ran loose.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress didn't tell the BLM how many wild animals to maintain,
saying only that they should be managed on lands where they roamed freely
in 1971. Other federal laws require that public lands be available for
multiple uses, including cattle grazing. Today, ranchers pay the
government about $1.35 a month for each cow that feeds on public land.</TE>
<TE>178,000 Animals Captured Since 1972</TE>
<TE>   The BLM began culling horses and burros, and from 1972 to 2000 put up
about 178,000 animals nationwide for adoption. It costs $2,000 to capture
and hold each horse and then find someone to adopt it.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, mustang fanciers adopted 6,202 wild horses. "They're a part
of Americana," said retired Air Force pilot Jack Hildum, paying the $125
adoption fee in Las Vegas for a horse he'll train for trail riding.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM has been sued for not prohibiting adopters from slaughtering
the animals. It agreed in 1997 to have the new owners sign affidavits
promising not to use horses for commercial purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Spring Valley, Dave Cattoor stands next to the pen and watches
the helicopter peel away to herd more horses. The pilot came back into
view 30 minutes later, with 30 horses running ahead of the chopper. As
the mustangs darted toward the right to escape the chute, the pilot
maneuvered sharply to the right and cut them off, pushing them forward to
their capture.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the pen, agitated horses ran in tight circles, banging against
the fence. Some bucked before quieting, but their wide eyes betrayed
their upset.</TE>
<TE>   During a break, a couple of cowboys warmed themselves around a camp
stove and drank hot chocolate while Cattoor reflected on his work.</TE>
<TE>   He's one of several private contractors the BLM hires for roundups and
is paid $200 for every horse his eight-person crew captures.</TE>
<TE>   Cattoor began gathering mustangs in 1956, before the animals were
protected. He estimates he's caught 140,000 wild horses during his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ones captured this day had been caught in the last roundup
here, four years ago, and were released back into the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "Those ones can be tough to bring in a second or third time," he said.
"They remember this."</TE>

<HD>Don't Tap Into Social Security</HD>
<DH>Four-fifths favor tax cut deferment over using the fund's revenue
to pay for other programs.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Although Americans express resounding approval of President Bush's
performance at home and abroad, an overwhelming majority would rather
cancel later stages of his signature tax cut than tap Social Security
revenue to pay for other government programs, a Los Angeles Times Poll
has found.</LD>
<LD>   With war, the recession and the tax cut's cost straining the
government's bottom line, the White House on Monday released a budget
that projects Washington will need to divert $1.73 trillion in Social
Security money to fund other programs through 2012. But in the Times
survey, fully four-fifths of Americans--including more than two-thirds of
Republicans--say they would rather defer tax cuts than use Social
Security money that way.</LD>
<LD>   Those findings may be the most ominous clouds for Bush in a political
environment defined mostly by his extraordinarily broad support.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional Democrats charge that Bush's tax cut, more than any
other factor, obliterated the anticipated federal budget surpluses and
forced the government to dip deeply into Social Security revenue--barely
more than a year after a 2000 campaign in which both parties pledged to
set aside that money in a "lockbox" to reduce the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the poll suggests, Democrats have not pinned the blame on Bush
for the reversal: Substantially more Americans blame the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 than the tax cut and Bush's policies for the return
of federal deficits. And more Americans express faith in Bush than
congressional Democrats to revive the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But on a series of questions, a majority of Americans indicated an
openness to reconsidering the tax cut--something Bush has pledged will
happen only "over my dead body." Said Doris Walls, a secretary in Denton,
Md., who responded to the survey: "Absolutely do not use Social Security
for anything other than Social Security. If they can't figure out some
other way . . . don't go ahead [with the tax cut]."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, supervised by Polling Director Susan Pinkus, surveyed
1,545 adults from Jan. 31 to Feb. 3. It has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, taken after Bush's State of the Union address Jan. 29,
finds the president in a commanding position. Fully 80% of Americans say
they approve of his job performance--down only slightly from his
stratospheric 86% rating in November. (Even nearly two-thirds of
Democrats give him positive marks.) Three-fourths say they approve of his
handling of foreign policy; 83% endorse his performance on the war in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Kendall, a small-business owner in Slidell, La., offered a typical
assessment. "I don't think anyone could have done anything better on the
war," she said. "He held his cool when initially it would have been so
easy to just start sending fliers over there."</TE>
<TE>   Another measure of the confidence in Bush as commander in chief: More
than three-fourths of Americans said they would support military action
against Iraq, which he named as part of an "axis of evil" that threatens
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The backing Bush has generated through his performance in the crucible
of war has spilled over to other issues, the survey found. By 42% to 30%,
Americans expressed more confidence in Republicans than Democrats to
handle the major problems facing the country. That advantage may reflect
the sense that terrorism has become the nation's top priority. Asked
directly which party they trust to fight terrorism, Americans picked the
GOP by more than 3 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   With his recent signing of landmark legislation reforming federal
education programs, Bush has also erased the historic Democratic
advantage on that critical domestic issue: More Americans express
confidence in Bush (38%) than Democrats (30%) to improve the public
schools. On health care--another issue that has long favored
Democrats--Bush and congressional Republicans have fought the Democrats
to a draw, the poll found.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found substantial support for several other priorities Bush
laid out in his State of the Union address. For instance, more than eight
in 10 respondents said they support his call for spending $38 billion on
homeland security next year; a thin majority said it would support the
request even if it means cuts in other domestic programs.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, three-fourths of respondents endorsed his proposed
$48-billion increase in defense spending, and just over half said they
would still support that added money even if it requires cuts in domestic
programs. "That has to be our top priority because we have to build up
our armed forces; we have to get our country safe," said Sharon McCann, a
homemaker in Bird City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, two-thirds embraced Bush's proposal to build a
national missile defense. And, though considerably more Americans
expressed confidence in congressional Democrats than Bush to protect the
environment, a narrow plurality sided with the president on the central
environmental issue dividing the two parties: By 48% to 43%, Americans
said they supported the administration's proposal to open part of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration.</TE>
<TE>   But on the economy, Social Security and the federal budget, the poll
finds more hesitance about Bush--and a few outright chinks in his
formidable political armor. The country appears torn between its general
confidence in Bush, its attraction to walling off Social Security money
and its uncertainty about the economic value of the tax cut at the heart
of the president's domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Approved last year, the tax cut totals $1.3 trillion and is set to be
phased in over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence in Bush is evident in the striking finding that
two-thirds of Americans support his handling of the economy, even though
four-fifths say the country is in recession. A third of Americans say
they trust Bush most to revive the economy, compared with 29% who look
toward congressional Democrats and 19% for congressional Republicans.
Even if that's a much smaller advantage than Bush enjoys on
security-related issues, rarely do voters express so much backing for a
president's economic management when the economy is sputtering.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these questions divide the country along partisan lines unlike
anything relating to the war on terrorism. For instance, nearly
three-fifths of Democrats picked congressional Democrats as best able to
revive the economy, whereas over half of the Republicans picked Bush.
Independents divided almost evenly between the two sides.</TE>
<TE>   These partisan divisions resurface in other economic questions.
Overall, the country appears ambivalent about whether Bush's policies
will strengthen the economy: 38% said yes, 41% said they will make no
difference and 16% said they will weaken it. The country also is divided
about his tax cut, with 43% saying it's been good for the economy and 47%
saying it's either been bad (29%) or had no effect (18%).</TE>
<TE>   On both questions, Americans divided sharply along partisan and
ideological lines. Conservatives such as McCann remain enthusiastic about
keeping the tax cut law in place. "If you have tax cuts, the economy does
better; when you raise taxes, the economy doesn't do well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gene Meyers, a retired architect and self-identified liberal in
New York City, believes the tax cut has been a mistake. "I think it's
insane," he said. "The president campaigned on a fiscally responsible
[platform]. I cannot understand how you can be fiscally responsible and
create deficits wantonly."</TE>
<TE>   In the survey, many Americans shared Meyers' fear about deficits.
Looking backward, Americans were not inclined to indict Bush for the
return of the red ink: Just 11% blamed the tax cut and 13% Bush's
policies, compared with 42% who blamed the terrorist attacks and 15% the
recession.</TE>
<TE>   But looking forward, the poll found enormous resistance across party
lines to tapping Social Security money, or raising the national debt, to
pay for other government programs, as the budget Bush released Monday
proposes to do.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether future installments of the Bush tax cut scheduled for
2004 and 2006 should go through if that meant the government would have
to use Social Security revenue to fund other programs, Americans said no
by 81% to 13%. Even roughly seven in 10 Republicans and conservatives
said they would shelve the tax cut under those circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the tax cut should go through if it meant tapping Social
Security and increasing the national debt--as Bush's budget proposes for
the next three years--84% said no. Looking toward the 2004 presidential
election, 48% of registered voters said they are inclined to give Bush
another term, whereas 30% said they would prefer a Democrat. But when
asked which party they intend to support in this fall's congressional
elections --47% picked the Democrats, 41% the GOP.</TE>

<TE>HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,545 Americans nationwide by telephone Jan.
31 through Feb. 3. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all
exchanges in the nation. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so
that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex,
race, age, education and region. The margin of sampling error for the
entire sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain
subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can
also be affected by other factors such as question wording and the
order in which questions are presented.</TE>

and main recruiter in Singapore for Jemaah Islamiah, a long-hidden
terrorist group affiliated with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry says Bin Maidin had been working
quietly since at least 1990 to build a network capable of carrying out a
devastating attack against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He reported to leaders in Indonesia and Malaysia, authorities say,
evading Singapore's tight security and recruiting operatives for three
terror cells named after Islamic prophets. In 1993, he is said to have
received military training in Afghanistan. Casting himself as a religious
teacher, he looked for recruits willing to make the ultimate sacrifice
for Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin's activities came to an end in December, when he was
arrested along with a dozen other suspected Jemaah Islamiah members for
plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other Western targets in this
wealthy island nation.</TE>
<TE>   All 13 have been ordered held under Singapore's Internal Security Act
for two-year terms, which the government can renew indefinitely. Rather
than requiring a trial, Singaporean law allows the government to imprison
anyone who is found to be a security threat.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say 60 to 80 people, some of them women, belonged to the
Singapore organization, although not all were involved in illegal
activities. The investigation is continuing, and Singapore is seeking the
arrest of several people who have fled or gone into hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Jemaah Islamiah's ability to organize in Singapore, where the United
States has a large military presence, stunned American officials and
Singaporeans alike. Officials say one key element was Bin Maidin, who
managed to avoid suspicion despite his strong anti-Western views.</TE>
<TE>   The network was uncovered in October when one member, Mohammed Aslam
bin Yar Ali Khan, let it slip that he was going to Afghanistan, and an
informant tipped off the police. Authorities say they began monitoring
his acquaintances and discovered that the group was on the verge of
making truck bombs to launch multiple attacks in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that the organization's ideology was imported from
neighboring countries but that the terror cells themselves were purely
home-grown.</TE>
<TE>   In Singapore, a former British colony dominated by ethnic Chinese,
Muslims make up 15% of the population. Most are of Malay or Indian
descent and historically have occupied the lower strata of society.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin is said to have found his believers among the Muslim middle
class, including mid-level managers, small-business men, drivers and
technicians alienated by Singapore's materialism and America's powerful
economic influence.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 13 arrested in December, all were Singaporeans except one, who
had given up his citizenship to become Malaysian. All had attended local
schools. Six had served in the country's armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the suspected cell members wore Western-style clothes and kept
their beards short. They avoided going to mosques, where undercover
agents are known to mingle with the faithful.</TE>
<TE>   They gathered at private apartments and were usually careful not to
talk to outsiders about their beliefs. At work, they did their jobs well
and kept their religious views to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The group thrived on secrecy, using code-names and code-words for
communication, and appeared to have generally kept away from mainstream
organizations and their activities," said a Home Affairs Ministry
spokesman who declined to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin, however, was different. His habit of wearing an Arab-style
robe and a traditional cap stood out in the upscale neighborhood near
downtown where he was the maintenance manager of the 12-story Belmont
condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   He had worked at the building for 15 years and sometimes seemed to act
as if it was his. Residents say he was autocratic, at times even
intimidating. He made it clear that he didn't like children playing ball
in the courtyard. Foreigners who met him got the feeling that he didn't
like them either.</TE>
<TE>   When the arrests were announced in January, some people who had
encountered Bin Maidin were not entirely surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't a huge shock to me," said one Belmont resident who asked not
to be identified. "We used to joke that he was Osama bin Laden's brother.
He looked the part."</TE>
<TE>   He called himself Haji Ibrahim bin Haji Maidin, a title meaning that
both he and his father had made the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.
He seemed to use his vacation every year to go on the hajj. In hindsight,
some Belmont residents wonder where he really went.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin had no formal religious education, authorities say, but had
received training from radical Indonesian clerics who occasionally
visited Singapore. The lessons reportedly reinforced his anti-Western
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Ibrahim was a self-taught religious teacher apart from some lessons
from Indonesian religious teachers," said the ministry spokesman. "We
surmise that his knowledge of Islam is quite shallow, and therefore what
he could pass on would also be quite shallow. The group was obviously
influenced by foreign elements and subscribed to these elements'
extremist ideology and anti-American, anti-West agenda."</TE>
<TE>   One of the visiting Muslim preachers was Abu Bakar Bashir, who has
been identified by Singapore authorities as the overall leader of Jemaah
Islamiah, or Islamic Community.</TE>
<TE>   Two other accused leaders of the group also taught in
Singapore--Mohammed Iqbal bin Abdul Rahman, who was arrested in Malaysia
last June, and Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, who is sought by
police in three countries. Authorities say Hambali was in charge of all
the terror network's operations in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, wanted in Malaysia and under investigation in Indonesia, where
he lives on the island of Java, denies that he heads the terrorist group
but praises Bin Laden as "a true Muslim fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir acknowledged in an interview that Bin Maidin was one of his
students. During the 1990s, he said, he occasionally traveled to
Singapore to teach gatherings of 20 to 30 people in private apartments.
His lessons included the principles of jihad, or holy war, and the use of
violence to defend Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, I am the religious teacher who taught them," Bashir
said. "If I'm not mistaken, Ibrahim is a teacher. That's what I recall. I
don't know him well."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he did not remember meeting any of the other 12 men
arrested in Singapore, although he said it is possible that some attended
his lessons.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how Bin Maidin may have recruited his students. In
Singapore, it is illegal to teach religion without a government license.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say Bin Maidin steered clear of religious organizations and,
apart from praying regularly, was not active in any mosque. He also was
careful not to call himself a religious teacher in public.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect that some of his initial converts found likely
candidates and steered them to Bin Maidin. He would meet with one or two
students at a time at the apartments of Jemaah Islamiah members.</TE>
<TE>People at Mosque Remember Him Well</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin always left work to attend both afternoon prayer sessions
at the mosque, one co-worker said.</TE>
<TE>   "He never missed," she said. "He went to the mosque even when it
rained."</TE>
<TE>   At the Al Huda mosque, eight blocks from the Belmont, people remember
him well.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, he stayed only long enough to pray. He always smiled but
rarely said more than the customary greeting. No one seemed to know his
name until his arrest was broadcast on television and splashed on the
front page of the newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a loner," said Syed Ahmed bin Syed Abdullah Baharun, 55, who
says he often saw Bin Maidin at the mosque. "He would just slip in, have
a pray and go back to work."</TE>
<TE>   One mosque-goer who declined to give his name said he occasionally
chatted with Bin Maidin over a period of six or seven years. It was clear
that Bin Maidin had studied extensively and memorized much of the Koran,
this man said.</TE>
<TE>   During one such conversation recently, Bin Maidin called Americans
terrorists because the United States was bombing Afghanistan, his fellow
mosque-goer said. But mostly, Bin Maidin just listened.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good listener, not a good talker," the man said. "He seemed a
harmless man."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities take a different view. They say that the Singapore branch
of Jemaah Islamiah was highly structured and that Bin Maidin oversaw all
of its activities.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the leader of the local grouping of the Jemaah Islamiah, so he
would have knowledge of what individual cells, including the operations
cells, were doing," the Home Affairs Ministry spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the closure of U.S. bases in the Philippines a decade ago,
Singapore has become the U.S. military's most important resupply point in
Southeast Asia. U.S. military airplanes frequently use Paya Lebar air
base. An average of 100 Navy vessels a year stop here, and thousands of
sailors take shore leave.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Maidin's group plotted to attack U.S. ships at sea, planes at the
air base and sailors on city streets, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Jemaah Islamiah was divided into sections that handled fund-raising,
security, communications, religious activities and terror operations,
authorities say. Police identified three operations cells, or fiahs, that
had four to five members each.</TE>
<TE>   One cell, Fiah Ismail, was formed after the Sept. 11 attacks on the
U.S. but quickly shut down when police began making arrests in December,
the government says.</TE>
<TE>   Including Bin Maidin, the organization is said to have sent at least
eight members to train at camps in Afghanistan for periods of three to
six months.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the arrangements were made by Hambali, the Indonesian
cleric, who supplied false papers saying that the members would attend a
religious school in Pakistan. Once there, they slipped across the border
into Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Their training at Al Qaeda camps included military tactics and the use
of AK-47s and mortars, officials say. One Singaporean, they say, went to
Afghanistan for training three times between 1991 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Khalim bin Jaffar, a 39-year-old printer, was one of the cell members
chosen to train at an Al Qaeda camp, the government says. The leader of
Jemaah Islamiah's first terrorist cell, which was named Fiah Ayub, he
went to Afghanistan from September 1999 to April 2000, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Before his arrest, Bin Jaffar worked at the Hoe Hup printers, where
fellow employees had no idea of his views. As far as they knew, he did
not pray during the day.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very good worker," said one colleague. "He kept to himself.
When he applied for the job, we didn't ask if he worked for Osama."</TE>
<TE>   Bin Jaffar began taking religious lessons from Bin Maidin in 1989 or
1990, investigators say. Before long, they say, he was teamed up with
fellow cell member Hashim bin Abas.</TE>
<TE>   An engineer, Bin Abas met Bin Maidin in 1991 through his
brother-in-law, a cleric in Malaysia who became the leader of a parallel
network there, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bin Jaffar and Bin Abas took classes from the Indonesian teachers
Iqbal and Hambali. In 1994 or 1995, they went to Malaysia together to a
jungle survival camp, the government says.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Jaffar was the physical trainer for the Singapore network,
authorities say. Bin Abas served as treasurer and secretary, they say,
and procured items such as night-vision binoculars that police later
seized at Bin Jaffar's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Abas' last job was as a traveling service representative for the
Singapore office of Bystronic, a Swiss-owned machine-tool company. He
traveled the Asia-Pacific region, going as far as Australia and China.
There is no indication of whether he made contact with terrorist networks
during his travels.</TE>
<TE>   A Bystronic official said Bin Abas' co-workers knew nothing about his
religious views or personal life.</TE>
<TE>   "He was hardly in the office," she said. "He was quiet, a good worker.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Abas lived in an apartment on the eighth floor of a government
high-rise. Neighbors say he has five children and that his wife wore a
black gown with a veil and head scarf when she went out.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor said that Bin Maidin and Bin Jaffar, whom she recognized
from newspaper photos, were among a variety of men who visited the
apartment at all hours.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1997, authorities say, Bin Jaffar came up with the idea of
killing U.S. sailors on leave in Singapore as they traveled from the
Sembawang Wharves to the Yishun transit station in northern Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Jaffar and Bin Abas plotted to put a bomb in a parked motorcycle
and set it off as sailors got off a shuttle bus and walked to the metro
station, the authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Jaffar videotaped the busy intersection, shooting footage near a
police post as well as such American symbols as a McDonald's and a
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet. Bin Abas narrated the tape.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the video was subsequently delivered to top Al Qaeda leader
Mohammed Atef in Afghanistan by Faiz bin Abu Bakar Bafana, a suspected
regional leader of Jemaah Islamiah. Bafana, who authorities say ranked
above Bin Maidin, was one of the 13 arrested in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda leaders are said to have been impressed by the Singapore
group's ability to organize such an attack but to have decided not to
pursue the plan. The videotape was found in the rubble of Atef's house in
December after he was killed by a U.S. airstrike.</TE>
<TE>   Police recently discovered a second copy of the video in a secret
compartment in Bin Jaffar's apartment. Authorities believe it is the
original tape because it does not have Bin Abas' narration.</TE>
<TE>   "The new finding shows a very direct link between the Jemaah Islamiah
group detained here and Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan," said Home
Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng.</TE>
<TE>'Kill Zone' Information Found on Seized Map</TE>
<TE>   From a computer hard disk found with the videotape, authorities say
they recovered a file titled "Security of an Organization" that
instructed cell members how to maintain secrecy and avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they earlier found at the same apartment a Defense
Ministry map showing an offshore "kill zone," where U.S. naval vessels
could be attacked, and a list of 200 U.S. companies operating in
Singapore, with three highlighted as potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Jaffar also was in possession of covert photos of U.S. military
aircraft taken at the Paya Lebar air base, authorities say. They say the
pictures were taken by Ali Ridhaa bin Abdullah, a senior aircraft repair
technician at Singapore Technologies Aerospace, a government-controlled
aerospace company. Born Andrew Gerard, he converted from Roman
Catholicism to Islam in 1988, the same year he began working for the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "He is known to be a conscientious worker, and we have never had any
problems with his quality of work," said company spokeswoman Celina Low.
"He is known to his colleagues as a friendly person."</TE>
<TE>   The company is located next to the air base, and Bin Abdullah, a
suspected Jemaah Islamiah member, was asked by the second cell, the Fiah
Musa, to collect information about U.S. planes, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The air base is protected by razor wire, high fences topped with
barbed wire, dogs and armed guards in camouflage. Warning signs are
posted all around it. "NO PHOTO TAKING," says one. "PROTECTED AREA," says
another, which is illustrated with a picture of a soldier pointing a gun
at a trespasser.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say that Bin Abdullah used his company position to slip
onto the base and take more than 50 photos of the planes and their
surroundings with a digital camera.</TE>
<TE>   Officials stress that Singapore is safe. After all, they note,
authorities broke up the terror cells before the group could launch an
attack.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech in late January, however, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
warned that Singapore still faces the risk of attack by escaped cell
members or networks based elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We can expect radical and militant terrorists in the region,
especially where they have not been put on the run, to try and hit out at
American targets in Singapore, or even Singapore targets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Al Huda mosque, when men hang around after prayers, the
conversation often turns to the subject of Bin Maidin. Some say they are
glad the authorities were able to break up the cells before innocent
people were killed and Singapore's reputation was tarnished.</TE>
<TE>   "We called him Osama and everybody laughed," said one. "It happened to
be true."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Workers Held Back by Low Education Rate</HD>
<DH>Labor: One in 10 adults has only six years of schooling or less.
The trend may spell trouble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reyna Lavariega's parents were too poor to buy a pencil or a
notebook. That's why they never sent her to school.</LD>
<LD>   As a young adult, she cobbled together as much education as she could
in Oaxaca, Mexico. Still, she was barely able to read and write when she
joined her husband in Los Angeles 12 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now Lavariega washes broken stoves and refrigerators for the family
appliance repair business, which is run out of the basement of her rented
home near MacArthur Park. She hopes for something better, but knows the
odds are against her: "I have no skills, no education. All I have is a
great desire to work. It isn't enough."</LD>
<TE>   There are thousands like her in the blue-collar neighborhoods of Los
Angeles: immigrants who never got past primaria, the basic six-year
public education of rural Mexico and Central America. In the best of
times, they hang on to jobs with landscaping services and in carwashes,
garment shops and steamy restaurant kitchens. The recession has hit their
tenuous lives hard, and a lack of skills makes it that much harder to
claw back.</TE>
<TE>   It is a problem not only for Lavariega and other low-skilled workers,
but also for the city that has been their beacon for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   One in 10 adults in the Los Angeles region has six years of education
or less. That rate is the worst of all U.S. metropolitan areas, including
the immigrant magnets of New York, Chicago and Miami, and is more than
double that of San Francisco and Sacramento, according to a tabulation of
recent federal statistics for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Even compared to other California cities, Los Angeles stands out.
Nearly 25% of Los Angeles adults never completed high school--about
double the rate of San Francisco and San Diego. Only agricultural
communities such as Visalia and Modesto have larger shares of
nongraduates.</TE>
<TE>   While shrinking nationwide, the pool of minimally educated adults has
grown steadily in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for a generation,
researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   From 1983 to 1999, the number of workers lacking a high school diploma
decreased by 20% nationwide, yet increased by 50% in the Los Angeles-Long
Beach area, a separate study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at
Northeastern University in Boston showed.</TE>
<TE>   "These findings reveal that the Long Beach-L.A. labor market is moving
in a decidedly different direction than the nation as a whole, employing
growing shares of high school dropouts in the [construction],
goods-producing and retail-trade sectors," wrote Neeta Fogg and Paul
Harrington, who prepared the report for the U.S. Conference of Mayors
work-force development summit in Long Beach last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Nationally, all three of these industry sectors substantially reduced
their reliance on dropouts," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The trend has enabled the region to retain and even increase low-wage
manufacturing and service jobs that have disappeared elsewhere and helps
explain why blue-collar employment grew in Los Angeles at more than twice
the national rate, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   But it also drives huge disparities in wealth and complicates a range
of social issues, from education to health care.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the cycle is interrupted, Harrington said, "it means rising
poverty, more inequality, a less productive economy and probably more
social disruption."</TE>
<TE>   Using numbers from the Current Population Survey of the Census Bureau,
Harrington and Fogg looked at a period of wrenching change for Southern
California, which lost thousands of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in
aerospace and other manufacturing industries in the late 1980s and early
1990s. The region rebuilt a blue-collar base--becoming the national
leader in manufacturing jobs for much of the last decade--but the work
shifted to small, nonunion shops that produced clothing, furniture and
other nondurable products.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation of the Los Angeles economy coincided with
tremendous demographic changes: Not only did the region draw more
immigrants than anyplace else in the nation, but the new arrivals tended
to have less education than immigrants to other areas.</TE>
<TE>   On average, about 37% of noncitizens in the nation's metropolitan
areas lack a high school diploma, according to the business-supported
Economic Policy Institute in Washington. That rate jumps to 52% in the
consolidated metro areas of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino,
said institute labor economist Ron Bird.</TE>
<TE>   Several researchers said the Los Angeles region is caught in a cycle
in which the labor pool attracts employers dependent on low-skilled
workers, which in turn attracts more such workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become addicted to the availability of very-low-wage labor from
Mexico," said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, who directs UCLA's North American
Integration and Development Center. "We have used this unwittingly as an
economic strategy, but it creates an industrial base that is not very
productive and is vulnerable to low-wage competition around the world. In
the long run, we can't survive as a sweatshop economy."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers representing a range of political viewpoints have reached
similar conclusions, but there is little agreement on the proper
response. Ideas range from further restricting immigration to passing a
general amnesty for illegal immigrants, which in theory would encourage
them to seek better training and demand fair treatment on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that an increase in the minimum wage and beefed-up
enforcement of labor laws would halt the proliferation of extremely
low-skilled, exploitative jobs and thus cut the cycle. But they caution
that a certain number of low-skilled, low-wage workers, particularly in
service industries, benefit the economy overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost impossible to look at the evidence and say, 'This is good
or bad and these are the policy implications,' " said David Card, a labor
economist at UC Berkeley. "For high-income people, the ready supply of
lots of low-skilled workers is quite a boon. They staff nursing
facilities, do lawn care, work in carwashes. Those groups of workers
don't exist in other cities."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts agree the skills deficit in Los Angeles requires more
strategic economic development and an intensive commitment to job
training, which has lately emerged as the nation's answer to rising
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "This group of noncitizens is a great potential asset," said Bird of
the Economic Policy Institute, which contends that the nation is facing a
long-term labor shortage that immigrants can help fill. "The challenge is
to deliver appropriate services of education and training. In the long
run, the returns to society have always been positive."</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, training and development have been addressed in an ad
hoc fashion, by state and local government programs and independent
nonprofit groups. Still, there are scattered successes, noble efforts and
sometimes overwhelming obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pacoima Workforce Development Initiative, a privately funded
job-training program of the Valley Economic Development Center, director
Mario Matute struggles to match the needs of local employers with the
area's abundant supply of eager workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of skills and education are what's holding them back,"
Matute said from his cubbyhole office in a city building in Pacoima.
"What I hear [from employers] over and over again is that their skills
and what I have do notmatch."</TE>
<TE>   Even warehouse and factory jobs often require basic English literacy
and sometimes rudimentary computer skills, he said. Those that don't have
those requirements generally pay less than $15,000 a year and offer
little security.</TE>
<TE>   Matute, whose program handles 3,000 job seekers, tackles the biggest
obstacles first. Applicants without legal residency are referred to a
nonprofit immigration law center. Those without English proficiency--the
majority--are guided to English-as-a-second-language classes. Many are
sent around the corner to computer classes run by the Los Angeles Unified
School District, where they learn not to fear the keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   A few are funneled into vocational programs in health care, child care
and janitorial services.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Veronica Berrios, a mother of four from El Salvador, who
left school in the 11th grade and has cleaned houses during most of her
nine years in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Berrios is close to completing a two-year child-care training program,
a collaborative effort between the Pacoima initiative and Mission College
in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   While the program paid for baby-sitting for her own children, she
studied English, child development, cultural diversity and other
subjects. Last year, she landed a $10-an-hour job caring for infants at a
day-care center in Arleta.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the region, community colleges, school districts and
community organizations are trying to tackle the skills gap, with varying
success.</TE>
<TE>   Some students work all the way from below seventh-grade reading skills
to a high school equivalency certificate, said Cynthia Moore, principal
of the Metropolitan Skills Center in the Westlake district, one of
several vocational training schools run by the Los Angeles Unified School
District.</TE>
<TE>   She conceded, however, that such achievements are rare. Among those
who keep trying is Lavariega, 45, who has walked the 10 blocks from her
home to a survival English class at the skills center every weekday
morning for two years.</TE>
<TE>   For 2 1/2 hours, she joins 37 other students practicing the proper way
to fill out a job application, ask for a favor and read a bus schedule in
English.</TE>
<TE>   Someday, said the mother of five, her diligence may pay off. Her
ultimate goal? To land a steady factory job that pays the minimum wage,
plus benefits.</TE>
<TE>   She laughed as she said it, shaking her head. With her background,
that modest goal seemed as unreachable as the moon.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Debt Drags on Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new wave of corporate bankruptcies is reminding workers and
investors that the fallout from the recession isn't over.</LD>
<LD>   A major problem remains with the huge debt load U.S. companies took on
during the late 1990s. In some industries--particularly
telecommunications--the debt mania at its peak rivaled the stock mania in
the dot-com sector.</LD>
<LD>   Corporations, excluding banks and other financial companies, have more
than $4.9 trillion in bond and bank debt, up a trillion dollars just
since 1998. Now, some analysts believe high corporate debt could keep any
economic recovery in low gear for the next few years.</LD>
<TE>   "Unless you see a rapid turnaround in profit growth, [many companies]
are going to be financially strapped" by debt, said Paul Kasriel,
economist at Northern Trust Securities in Chicago. That, in turn, could
limit businesses' ability to spend on new equipment or on workers.</TE>
<TE>   Even as key economic indicators suggest a rebound, the failures in
recent weeks of Enron Corp., Kmart Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd., among
others, have pointed up the threat companies still face from heavy debt
burdens.</TE>
<TE>   The boom times of the late 1990s encouraged companies to borrow
aggressively, particularly via long-term bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The total amount of corporate bond debt outstanding rose just 25% from
the end of 1990 to the end of 1994, according to credit-rating firm
Moody's Investors Service. But as the economy grew rapidly from 1995 to
1999, corporate bond debt rocketed 125%, to $2.59 trillion by the end of
1999, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more striking, even as the economy slowed in 2000 and 2001,
corporate bond debt continued to grow, reaching $3.39 trillion by the end
of last year, according to Moody's.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those corporate borrowers continue to pay their lenders the
interest they're owed, and aren't in danger of insolvency. Still, the
interest costs that companies bear have helped cause a plunge in
corporate earnings over the last year that has been far more severe than
the modest decline in U.S. gross domestic product would imply.</TE>
<TE>   For example, paper and forest products giant International Paper Co.
borrowed heavily in recent years to acquire several major rivals. The
deals have nearly doubled the company's long-term debt burden since 1996,
to $13.3 billion now. The company's interest bill on its debt totaled
$929 million last year, which helped to reduce its net income for the
year to $214 million, a 78% drop from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, debt often serves a useful purpose, analysts note. Just as
a mortgage allows a family to buy a home that may appreciate in value in
the long run, bonds allow companies to make investments that ultimately
may produce generous returns for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   But debt costs that seemed manageable in an economic boom quickly can
become onerous in an economic bust, as companies' sales and earnings
decline--and in some cases their assets, as well-- while their debt
expense stays level.</TE>
<TE>   "Debt only becomes a problem when a company isn't generating enough
cash flow to meet" interest and principal payments, said John Lonski,
economist at Moody's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   That predicament has befallen many more companies over the last year,
resulting in the highest rate of bond defaults--missed interest
payments--in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said 253 companies worldwide defaulted on $110.2 billion of
bonds last year, compared with 167 companies defaulting on $49.2 billion
of bonds in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The firm expects defaults to continue to rise in the first half of
this year, even if the economy grows.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, January saw a record 41 companies default, according to
Standard &amp; Poor's, another debt-rating firm. For example, Houston-based
Kaiser Aluminum Corp., the nation's second-largest aluminum company, last
week missed a  25.5-million interest payment due some of its bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   The number of U.S. public companies filing for bankruptcy protection
topped 240 last year, according to the Boston-based Turnaround Letter.
The companies listed total assets of more than $250 billion, by far a
one-year record.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, it isn't unusual for corporate failures to continue to
rise at the start of an economic recovery, as companies that had been
barely hanging on find they can't keep going. The question is whether
this time will be worse because of the level of debt.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts worry that the Federal Reserve, in slashing short-term
borrowing costs to 40-year lows, is in effect supporting many companies
that ought to be allowed to fail--or that at least should be encouraged
to shed debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually recessions are a time when you repair your balance sheet,"
Kasriel said. But he fears that too few companies have taken meaningful
steps in that direction, which could mean prolonging the process of
weeding out weak firms.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue the financial system is in fact repairing itself. Given
the rise in bond defaults and bankruptcies over the last year, "it seems
to me the adjustments are taking place," said William Dudley, economist
at brokerage Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Dudley and others also note that the continuing surge in bond issuance
last year in part reflected companies' refinancing of older, higher-cost
debt at lower yields, just as many households refinanced their mortgages
to save money as market interest rates dropped.</TE>
<TE>   In some debt-heavy industries, however, market forces have adopted a
take-no-prisoners approach to troubled borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no sector has been as hard-hit by debt woes as the
telecommunications industry. Beverly Hills-based Global Crossing, which
operates a worldwide fiber optic network, became the largest
telecom-company bankruptcy when it sought court protection on Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   But Global Crossing is just another in a lengthening queue of telecom
firms to go belly-up. It was followed last week by McLeodUSA Inc., a
Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based telephone company.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom companies borrowed tens of billions of dollars in the bond
market in the late 1990s to build new networks. But it represented
massive overkill: The marketplace has been able to absorb only a small
portion of the new network infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   With no possibility of profit on the horizon, and their funding cut
off, dozens of telecom companies have failed over the last year, leaving
bondholders holding the bag.</TE>
<TE>   Just as with dot-com stocks, the question asked today is why investors
were such poor judges of the telecom firms they funded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually laughable how that money was allocated" to telecom
companies, said one institutional investor. He noted that bond investors
are expected to be savvier and more risk-conscious than stock investors.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say bond offerings in general were an easy sell in the
late '90s because the stock market's record gains sent such a bullish
message to investors overall: the idea that recession was a thing of the
past, and that economic growth could continue forever.</TE>
<TE>   "Bond investors believed what the equity market told them," said
Moody's Lonski.</TE>
<TE>   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is criticized by some for appearing to
egg-on both the stock and bond markets with many comments in the late
'90s about a "new economy" and about the perceived benefits of companies'
heavy investments in new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Barton Biggs, investment strategist at brokerage Morgan Stanley in New
York, says Greenspan "provided the high-octane fuel, both intellectual
and monetary, that transformed a 'healthy' bull market and a 'normal'
expansion into the most gigantic boom and bubble of all time."</TE>
<TE>   But one use of debt that Greenspan did not champion outright in the
late '90s nonetheless became standard at many companies: borrowing to
fund share repurchases.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies issued debt not to buy capital goods but to buy
back their own stock--and at high prices," Kasriel said.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation was to boost reported per-share earnings. As a company
retired stock, net income was spread over fewer shares, instantly juicing
growth rates.</TE>
<TE>   But those earnings gains are history, while the debt issued to fund
the buybacks is still on corporate balance sheets, and must be serviced.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rising number of corporate bond defaults over the last
year, the vast majority of companies will continue to pay their debt
bills, analysts say. The bigger issue is how great a weight the debt will
be in terms of limiting companies in other spending.</TE>
<TE>   "If companies are so heavily indebted that they can't adopt new
technologies, they're going to have a problem" long term, Lonski said.</TE>
<TE>   That also could keep the economy as a whole from getting back on a
strong growth track soon, Lonski and others said.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Opposes Second Term for Chief Parks, Sources Say</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Mayor reportedly voiced concerns about his leadership. Both
refuse to comment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has decided to oppose Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks' bid for reappointment, arguing that Parks has not done
enough to fight crime, reform the LAPD, or strengthen relations between
police and residents.</LD>
<LD>   A day before Parks announced his decision to seek a second, five-year
term, Hahn informed the chief that he would not back him, sources
familiar with the conversation said.</LD>
<LD>   The final call on Parks' fate rests with the city's civilian Police
Commission, whose members were appointed by Hahn and confirmed by the
City Council.</LD>
<TE>   Late Monday afternoon, Hahn shared his decision with a dozen African
American community activists, religious leaders and political officials
who have been lobbying him to support Parks. Those participants,
according to two who were there, tried to talk Hahn out of his decision
but left disappointed and angered that the mayor was moving against a
chief whose work they admire.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very, very upset," John Mack, president of the Urban League, said
after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 30, sources said, Hahn told the chief that he was disappointed
with the LAPD's lack of progress in implementing a federal consent decree
that mandates reforms of the LAPD and in improving community policing. In
addition, the mayor expressed concern about the rising crime rate and the
number of officers leaving the department, according to people who were
told of the meeting by the participants.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn suggested that rather than seek another term, Parks should take
credit for a successful career and retire.</TE>
<TE>   Parks delivered his public response 24 hours later, when he announced
to a room full of supporters at a Hollywood club that he was seeking a
second term as chief. By charter, the city's police chief is limited to
two terms. The only other chief covered by that charter provision, Willie
L. Williams, was denied a second term.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan said Parks would not comment on the
meeting. Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the mayor had no comment as
well.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's decision to oppose Parks--which he is expected to make
public today--puts the chief in an awkward professional and political
position. Should the Police Commission, whose members were appointed by
Hahn, decide to back the chief over the mayor, Parks would return for
another term but be given the task of carrying out the wishes of a chief
executive who had publicly urged him to go. Similarly, the mayor's
decision creates a difficult choice for the Police Commission, which has
vowed to act independently but now must risk antagonizing the mayor who
appointed its members or appearing to cave to pressure from the mayor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has said it intends to vote on Parks' reappointment
this spring. His term ends in August.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said Monday that he is
interested in the mayor's perspective, but added that he will weigh
Hahn's opinion no more heavily than anyone else's.</TE>
<TE>   "'I would certainly like his opinion, mostly because he's the mayor
and he's had 20 years of experience working with the chief," Caruso said.
"But it's not going to influence how I make my decision, nor do I think
he would want it to."</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn, who has said he would refrain on commenting publicly
regarding the chief's reappointment until the process had begun, the
political implications of his position also are far-reaching.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and his father--a longtime county supervisor--have enjoyed
staunch support from African American voters for decades. Parks, who is
African American, also enjoys significant support among those same
voters.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, activists, officials and religious leaders in the
city's African American communities have been mobilizing campaigns in
support of a second term for the chief.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Hahn spent almost two hours explaining his
position to a dozen leaders gathered at the Wilshire Boulevard office of
basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending included Johnson and his business partner Ken Lombard;
county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke; Rev. William Epps; Rev.
Frederick Murph; Geraldine Washington, head of the Los Angeles chapter of
the NAACP; Danny Bakewell, president of the Brotherhood Crusade; and Bill
Elkins, a longtime advisor to former Mayor Tom Bradley. Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles) participated via speakerphone.</TE>
<TE>   "What disappointment from every segment represented at the table,"
said Rev. Cecil Murray, who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Mack said Hahn's decision could prove divisive for the city and will
hurt the mayor's relationship with his black constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's going to be a great deal of anger and, perhaps in
some quarters, surprise, and a sense of betrayal, given the tremendous
support that Mayor Hahn received from this community," Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   If opposing Parks may alienate some supporters of the chief, the
mayor's decision puts him in alliance with the Police Protective League,
the union that represents the rank-and-file officers. The police union
has led the campaign against the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Hahn is expected to make his position public today, the union
is preparing to launch the next phase of its campaign to oust Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The league announced Monday that it will begin running television and
radio ads saying crime is up and that reform of the department has
stalled.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A.'s police chief asked all of us to judge him by his performance,"
a script for the television ad reads. "We think you should do just that."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has repeatedly called on the union to stop its campaign, and
several members of his staff have met with league officials to urge them
to lower their rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn and Parks, the split over the chief's reappointment comes
after a series of issues on which they have disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn was city attorney, the two men took different positions in
the city's negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department for a federal
consent decree mandating reforms of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The chief opposed that decree, while Hahn's office took the lead in
negotiating it.</TE>
<TE>   After he became mayor, Hahn, over the chief's objections, pushed for a
flexible work schedule for police officers, allowing them to work three-
and four-day weeks. That fulfilled a campaign promise that Hahn made and
that helped him secure the endorsement of the Police Protective League in
last year's election.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the mayor has said publicly that he would come to a
conclusion about Parks based on his performance and would not be
influenced by political pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those great political no-win situations and, if you can't
win either way, then the best thing to do is always to do the right
thing, do what is the right decision anyway," Hahn said last week on the
"Ask the Mayor" radio call-in show. "If you try to guess the political
outcome of any decision you make, you're probably going to do wrong most
of the time."</TE>
<TE>   According to sources familiar with the conversations between the two
men, Hahn warned the chief at an earlier meeting that he was leaning
toward opposing his reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting Jan. 21, Hahn told the chief he was worried that the LAPD
was not doing enough to retain officers. By the end of 2001, there were
about 8,900 officers on the street, 1,200 less than authorized in the
department's budget.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also said he is concerned about the recent uptick in crime.
Although crime has declined dramatically during the last decade, it has
increased in the last two years, with violent crimes up 17.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday, officials said, Parks called Hahn to let him know that
he had decided to seek reappointment. The mayor asked him to come to City
Hall to discuss the matter, and the two met in the mayor's private office
for at least two hours, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in that conversation, according to those whom the mayor
and chief told about it, Hahn accused Parks of not being a members of the
mayor's team and suggested that Parks consider retiring.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting ended soon after that exchange, the sources said. The next
day, at a party celebrating his 37th anniversary in the department, Parks
told friends and family members, along with reporters, that he wants
another five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   "As we look to the future, and it's not going to be an easy future, we
look to be a part of this administration and the vision of it has," Parks
said. "We look to be a part of what Mayor Hahn has in store for the city
of Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Goma, Catastrophe Central</HD>
<DH>Africa: The Congolese town has borne such hardships as a cholera
epidemic and a recent volcanic eruption.</DH>

<DL>GOMA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>From her two-room shack on a green hilltop here, Miriam Makezi had
a front row seat in recent years at an evolving spectacle of human
misery.</LD>
<LD>   The display began in 1994, when Makezi's hometown was overrun by more
than 1 million Rwandan refugees. Many were Hutu extremists who over a
period of 100 days had hacked to death more than 800,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, dumping bodies in nearby rivers and lakes.</LD>
<LD>   In Goma's refugee camps, unsanitary conditions spawned a cholera
epidemic that wiped out about 12,000 people, including some of Makezi's
neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   For the next eight years, this eastern Congo city along the Rwandan
border was conflict central. Rebel armies recruited young men and
children to fight in a Congolese war that so far has claimed more than 2
million lives, according to United Nations estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Then last month, Mt. Nyiragongo, a volcano looming over this lakeside
city, spewed torrents of lava that swallowed half of Goma, destroying
tens of thousands of homes. Makezi's house was drowned in lava. She and
hundreds of thousands became homeless, the victims of Goma's latest
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "The volcano destroyed what the war left standing," Makezi said. "It
took everything we had. But soon this too will be over. We survived."</TE>
<TE>   If Goma is the symbol for the crises that plague Africa, its people
are the embodiment of human resilience, persevering in the face of war,
disease, hunger and natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   "Their threshold for suffering is so much higher than people who
haven't lived through this unbelievable series of catastrophes," said
Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, which has maintained an outpost here since 1994. "You have
to wonder: How much more can this city take?"</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Verheyden, a Belgian priest who has lived here for five years,
stood in his parish yard on a recent evening and surveyed the thousands
of people who had assembled that morning to wait for food and water from
relief workers. Many said they had not eaten in four days. Now it was
getting dark, and with no sign of help, the crowd slowly began to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Few complained or showed anger at church officials who had promised
food and water. Emotions waste energy, and on this day Gomans needed
every ounce to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "They accept that they have to help themselves," said the priest.
"They've learned that if they rely solely on others, they're not going to
make it."</TE>
<TE>   He paused, then added: "The Scriptures say that God will only give you
so much [adversity] that you can bear. Well, Goma has had [its] share,
then some more."</TE>
<TE>   Makezi, 38, left the food line and headed for her former neighborhood.
She and her seven children planned to spend the night with a neighbor
whose house was spared by the lava. Makezi still didn't know how she was
going to feed her young ones.</TE>
<TE>   "It's God's will," she said about the food trucks not showing up.
"Maybe they'll come tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Goma is located on the sandy shores of Lake Kivu in Africa's Great
Lakes region. Place the city beside the Pacific Ocean and it might
resemble Malibu, with steep, green hills cascading to sparkling blue
waters.</TE>
<TE>   Before it became known as the capital of catastrophe, Goma enjoyed a
reputation as a playground for the Belgian colonists who ruled Congo. In
the 1950s, shops here were stocked with Parisian food, wine and clothes
for Belgians who packed the resorts and Art Deco homes around Lake Kivu.</TE>
<TE>   Gomans, who worked as servants for the Belgians and were treated as
second-class citizens, did not fare better after independence.</TE>
<TE>   Mobutu Sese Seko, who seized power in 1965 and ruled Congo for 32
years, built a summer palace here after falling in love with Goma's cool
climate--the year-round average temperature is 59 degrees--and the nearly
mile-high altitude. Mobutu would take his friends, including South
African apartheid-era President Pieter W. Botha, to see hippopotamuses,
exotic birds and rare mountain gorillas in nearby Virunga National Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Mobutu neglected the city's development. The only well-paved road
was a 200-yard stretch in front of his lakefront home.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes from the diamonds, coltan (an ore used to make electronic
equipment) and other precious minerals mined in the area went to Mobutu
and his cronies, not to provide services for the people. The few Gomans
who could afford to make an international telephone call had to bribe
Mobutu's guards to use the presidential line.</TE>
<TE>   Gomans agree that the history of the city--and the entire Great Lakes
region--was changed in 1994 by the Rwandan genocide. Rwandan Hutus fled
to Goma to escape retribution for the killing of minority Tutsis, in
massacres organized by an extremist Hutu government and its proxy army,
the Interahamwe militia.</TE>
<TE>   Goma became the headquarters for Congolese rebel leader Laurent
Kabila, whose forces occupied the city in 1996. A new, Tutsi-dominated
Rwandan government attacked Goma's refugee camps later that year to drive
out militiamen who were living among the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Goma seemed set to benefit the next year when Kabila's army marched to
Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, and ousted Mobutu. But relations soon
soured between Kabila and his supporters in the Rwandan government, who
helped the Tutsi-dominated rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy,
known as the RCD, take control of the town.</TE>
<TE>   Living conditions for Gomans have deteriorated under the RCD.
Thousands of municipal workers haven't been paid in years. Francois
Nzabara, Goma's rebel-selected mayor, acknowledges that he has little
power to improve conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the mayor's job?" a visitor recently inquired. "To receive
complaints from residents," Nzabara replied. But five days after Mt.
Nyiragongo devastated Goma, no one was lined up at the mayor's office to
ask for help.</TE>
<TE>   Mitima Mvonabandi, a tax collector, said that though he had not
received his wages, he remained on the job so that he could trade favors
with businesspeople. "Many of them don't declare the full value of their
goods," he said. "I don't tell the RCD, and they help me feed my six
children. It's a fair trade."</TE>
<TE>   Several merchants said they buy protection for their businesses from
RCD commanders and their Rwandan backers. But most Gomans cannot afford
such services, and many parents urge their sons to join the RCD to
provide some security for the family.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that about 300,000 Gomans returned to their hometown three
days after fleeing the eruption showed their level of desperation--and
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Makezi's neighbor Jean-Paul Kisanga endured walking atop a quarter of
a mile of still-smoldering lava to reclaim his meager possessions: a
couple of mattresses, a few pots and pans, and some tattered clothes.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several months, Kisanga, an unemployed mechanic, has fed
his family with maize, bananas and spinach from a small plot near the
airport. He traded some bananas for a neighbor's potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. Nyiragongo destroyed the airport and Kisanga's garden. Recently
the family has had to rely on rations of cooking oil, flour and
high-protein biscuits from the U.N. World Food Program.</TE>
<TE>   In a few days, relief agencies that deal with immediate emergencies
plan to pack up and leave the city.</TE>
<TE>   Gomans, however, face another dire prediction. An Italian
volcanologist hired by the United Nations to inspect Mt. Nyiragongo has
warned that its recent activity created fissures extending just over a
mile from the city. The next eruption could bury the town, he warned.</TE>
<TE>   Unshaken, residents went about their business as usual.</TE>

<HD>Car Blast in Gaza Kills 5 Fighters; Retaliation Vowed</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian officials blame missile attack, but Israeli
military reportedly says gunmen's explosives detonated prematurely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Five Palestinian gunmen were killed Monday when their car exploded
in the Gaza Strip in what Palestinian officials said was a targeted
Israeli missile attack and a move to sabotage efforts to broker a
cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   The radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine vowed
retaliation for the members of its military wing, whose bodies were
discovered along with pieces of Kalashnikov rifles.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths followed Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's first
meeting with high-ranking Palestinian officials since he took office
nearly a year ago. The talks last week were held to search for ways to
end the violence that has torn Israel and the Palestinian territories for
more than 16 months.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon is scheduled to meet Thursday with President Bush in Washington
and has said he will ask the U.S. government to cut contacts with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army and government officials refused to comment on the Gaza
explosion. Israel Radio reported that its military sources said the men
were carrying an explosive device in the car that apparently went off
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   The radio also reported that two of the dead were wanted for an attack
last year on the Israeli army outpost of Marganit in the Gaza Strip in
which three soldiers were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, whom the Israelis have had under siege at his headquarters in
Ramallah in the West Bank for two months, accused Sharon of fueling
tensions with targeted killings, which the Palestinians call
assassinations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli government does not want to calm the situation," Arafat
said. "But it should know that the Palestinian people cannot be shaken or
broken."</TE>
<TE>   The car blew up on a rural road near the Rafah refugee camp, close to
the border with Egypt, and was reduced to a charred frame. Witnesses said
an unmanned drone reconnaissance plane was flying overhead after the
blast.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said four men were killed when Israeli
helicopter gunships fired missiles at the car. A fifth man died later.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths threatened to fuel the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation and perpetuate the cycle of Israeli-Palestinian killings. The
Democratic Front, a radical faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, issued a statement saying that "retaliation will come very
soon and will shake the land under the feet of the occupiers." The
faction is one of the Palestinian groups that have carried out attacks
against Israel in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians accuse the Israeli government of conducting a
state-sponsored assassination campaign. Israel says it is acting in
self-defense because the Palestinian Authority will not rein in
extremists who attack Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's explosion followed a predawn Israeli helicopter strike on an
industrial compound in the Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City. The
Israel Defense Forces said a Palestinian mortar factory was hit.
Palestinian officials said a wool mill, a furniture factory and a
plastics plant were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel claims the factories produced mortar shells, but this is
completely untrue," said Hassan Bassal, owner of the site.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said that during
the talks last week, Sharon turned down a request from the Palestinians
to suspend targeted killings for at least 10 days to allow their security
forces to restore calm. Last month's killing of a Palestinian militia
leader in an explosion blamed on Israel triggered a series of revenge
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon met Wednesday in Jerusalem with Ahmed Korei, the speaker of the
Palestinian parliament; Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's unofficial deputy; and
Mohammed Rashid, Arafat's financial advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he demanded that the Palestinians arrest terrorists and
dismantle militias--including Arafat's presidential guard, Force 17, and
the Tanzim militia of the Palestinian leader's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also insisted that Palestinians collect illegal weapons and
hand them over to the United States, take unspecified preventive measures
to stop attacks on Israelis and end incitement.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians asked that Sharon allow Arafat freedom of movement,
stop incursions into Palestinian-controlled territory and lift Israeli
blockades of Palestinian towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side gave ground. Jewish settlers and the Israeli far right,
however, accused Sharon of violating his pledge not to negotiate with the
Palestinians under fire. Critics on the left and the Palestinians,
meanwhile, charged that the prime minister had taken a tactical step
ahead of his trip to Washington to assert that he has tried to make
peace.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot decide what Sharon wants," said Palestinian Cabinet
Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman. "Maybe he wants to stop the criticism in
Israel over his meeting. Maybe he wants to say, 'I'm still the man with
the gun.' "</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia Disagree on 'Axis of Evil,' Direction of Terror War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush failed Monday to gain Russia's agreement that Iraq,
Iran and North Korea constitute what he again called an "axis of evil"
bent on spreading terror around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Bush met for about 30 minutes in the Oval Office with Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov, who afterward expressed skepticism about
the direction the president has taken in the new phase of the war against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has been eager to promote the success of the
U.S.-Russian relationship, in the wake of the president's frequent
contacts with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. But as Bush seeks to
carry the fight against terrorism beyond Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network and the defeated Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he is
encountering international realities that may strain Russian support for
Washington's course.</LD>
<TE>   Russia historically has been close to Iraq, and the two countries
appear to be developing stronger economic links, especially in the oil
business.</TE>
<TE>   Kasyanov made clear that Moscow is less willing than the United States
to single out Iraq, Iran and North Korea as renegade nations that may be
targeted next by Washington. He said the U.S. and Russia must "identify
dangers, real dangers, rather than imaginary" ones.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he thought the threat Bush says the three nations pose
is "imaginary," the prime minister avoided a direct answer. Instead, he
said that if specific dangers are identified, "we should . . . provide
evidence to each other and [then] assure all others that those threats
really exist."</TE>
<TE>   Kasyanov also expressed a readiness to cooperate with the
administration in seeking out such threats.</TE>
<TE>   Kasyanov's comments illustrate the balance Russia is trying to strike
in its dealings with the United States, said Dimitri K. Simes, president
of the Nixon Center, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russian officials do not agree with Bush's "axis of evil"
warnings--first issued in his State of the Union speech last week--they
do not view this difference as important enough to lead to a rupture in
the increasingly friendly ties between Washington and Moscow, Simes said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's main priorities, he added, are gaining membership in the
World Trade Organization and establishing a comfortable relationship with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--goals for which U.S. backing is
crucial. Bush's meeting with Kasyanov focused on those two issues, White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Russian officials believe it is in their best
interests to gain the goodwill of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, said Frank
Gaffney of the Center of Security Policy, another Washington think tank.
All are potential clients of Russian weapons technology.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase "axis of evil" aroused controversy in diplomatic circles
when Bush first used it. On Monday, he was anything but apologetic as he
repeated the phrase during a speech at Eglin Air Force Base in the
Florida Panhandle.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not specifically mention the three nations, Bush said
that "terrorist states and terrorist allies are an axis of evil, seeking
weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States of America will not permit the world's most
dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive
weapons," the president added. "It is now up to them to change their
behavior. They're on notice."</TE>

<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde took the unprecedented step
Monday of suspending all court challenges to an unpopular banking freeze
for 180 days in an attempt to shore up the teetering financial system.</LD>
<LD>   The move, outlined in an executive decree, came after a surprise
Supreme Court ruling Friday declaring the banking restrictions
unconstitutional. The decree sets up a likely showdown among the three
branches of government.</LD>
<LD>   The restrictions, which severely limit access to Argentines' savings
deposits and triggered mass protests, were imposed Dec. 1 by Duhalde's
predecessor, Fernando de la Rua, to stop a run on the banks. Argentines
had removed more than $1 billion from their bank accounts in one day
alone.</LD>
<TE>   Duhalde has said that giving Argentines unfettered access to their
savings accounts risks collapse of the financial system and could spur
some foreign banks to pull out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We will allow the people to spend their money, but we will have to
take great care with our next steps so that the financial system doesn't
collapse," Duhalde told reporters Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped to bring greater stability to the economy so that he
could begin relaxing the banking restrictions further.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Gregorio Badeni, a constitutional expert, said he believed that
the decree was questionable.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not valid because no one can stop people from going to the
courts to defend their rights," said Badeni, adding that a 180-day
suspension goes far beyond what is reasonable.</TE>

<LD>Candidates from Costa Rica's top two political parties prepared for
a presidential runoff after neither won the 40% needed for a first-round
victory.</LD>
<LD>   With 93% of precincts reporting after Sunday's vote, Abel Pacheco, 67,
a psychiatrist and novelist from the ruling Social Christian Unity Party,
led with 38.5% of the vote. Rolando Araya, 54, a chemical engineer from
the National Liberation Party, finished with 30.9%.</LD>
<LD>   A runoff will be held April 7, the first in more than 50 years.</LD>
<TE>   The runoff was due in part to a strong showing by Otton Solis, 47, a
National Liberation Party dissident running as the upstart Citizens'
Action Party's candidate. Solis received 26.3% of the vote.</TE>

<LD>Mexico won't support an upcoming U.N. vote on whether to condemn
Cuba for its human rights record, Mexican officials said during a visit

<LD>   Mexican President Vicente Fox and members of his government traveled
to Cuba to regain the confidence of Fidel Castro's administration and to
jump-start trade between the two nations.</LD>
<LD>   Cuba resents being named in the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission
vote and accuses countries that join the vote of being manipulated by the

birds. Last May, the government ordered a mass cull of 1.2 million birds
for fear of an epidemic of the virus.</LD>

<HD>City of Reporter's Kidnap No Stranger to Crime</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Karachi has succeeded in curbing abductions, but Pearl's
case appears atypical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>When Daniel Pearl's search for the underbelly of international
terrorism led him last month to this Arabian Sea port, the Wall Street
Journal reporter found himself in one of South Asia's most volatile
cities, where lawlessness and sectarian warfare have become part of life.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the only city in Pakistan where real, Western-style organized
crime thrives," said Aamer Ahmed Khan, editor of the Herald, Karachi's
liberal monthly magazine. "Criminals are known for what they are, yet
still have social respect."</LD>
<LD>   Large gambling and prostitution rings thrive here. Over the last two
decades, Karachi has become a major South Asian transit point for
smuggling guns and drugs. Muslim groups war with one another.</LD>
<TE>   Given Pearl's disappearance last month and the subsequent demands by
his apparent captors, it's ironic that this city of 12 million has made
real progress in controlling one major class of crime: kidnappings. The
seizure of prominent citizens has fallen from a high of 79 in 1990 to 13
cases last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jameel Yusuf, an important Karachi business leader who has helped
spearhead the fight against kidnappings, maintains that the epidemic has
been nearly wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   "This wave of crime is finished," Yusuf said confidently. "There are
more kidnappings and cases of extortion in Bombay [India] or New Delhi
today than in Karachi." Still, fear of kidnapping remains real in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Yusuf claimed that most of the kidnapping gangs--who seize people
almost exclusively for money rather than politics--have been broken.</TE>
<TE>   "Daniel's case is very different from the others," Yusuf said of
Pearl. "He sought an appointment with the abductors himself."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a seminar here Monday, a top police official in the region
said he believes the kidnapping was not planned. "He wasn't taken
forceably," said Inspector General Syed Kamel Shah. "He went to see
people who then took him."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 as he was investigating links between a
Pakistani Islamic militant leader, Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, and
British national Richard C. Reid, who allegedly tried to blow up a
transatlantic airliner in December by detonating explosives packed into
his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   There was no word Monday on the fate of the 38-year-old journalist.
Paul Steiger, managing editor of the Journal, appealed for his release in
an open letter to the group that claimed responsibility for the
abduction. "I have not heard from you for several days and want to begin
a dialogue that will address your concerns and bring about Danny's safe
release," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's wife pleaded for his life during an appearance on BBC
television, saying she was willing to die in his place. "Don't harm an
innocent man because you're just going to create one more misery," said
Mariane Pearl, who is six months pregnant with the couple's first child.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators have concluded that only the first two of 10
e-mail messages sent in the name of the kidnappers were genuine. The
first two electronic messages contained photos of Pearl in captivity. The
second of the two threatened to kill him within 24 hours unless the
United States met a string of vague and sweeping demands, including the
release of Pakistanis captured in Afghanistan and now held by U.S. forces
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   At the time he vanished, Pearl was on his way to meet an intermediary,
believed to be Bashir Ahmed Shabbir, who reportedly promised to lead him
to Gilani. Police are seeking Shabbir.</TE>
<TE>   The falling rate of kidnappings aside, Karachi can still be a
dangerous place.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistanis are quick to note that only a small fraction of Karachi's
violence is directed against foreigners, but Americans have been targeted
before. In 1997, Islamic militants gunned down four American employees of
a Texas oil company and their Pakistani driver. In 1995, two American
diplomats were slain when gunmen opened fire on a U.S. Consulate van./</TE>
<TE>   Today, for many of the Americans living in the city, heavy security is
just an extension of life's routine. U.S. diplomats, for example, drive
in armor-plated cars and are trailed by a second car carrying armed
guards. "Even when they go grocery shopping, that's the way it is," one
resident said.</TE>
<TE>   American visitors are advised to avoid travel after dark and consider
as much as two-thirds of the city as a "no-go" zone. The measures are
hardly surprising, given that there are areas where even Pakistani police
don't dare go.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi's slide into violence and crime in many ways is linked with
the decades of turbulence in neighboring Afghanistan. As Pakistan's
largest city and biggest port, Karachi became an important conduit for
smuggling weapons to the conflict zone. It also became a training area
for the most militant of Muslim recruits heading for the fight.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, more than 1 million Afghan refugees migrated to the
city during the 1980s and '90s, many of them linked to the drug trade in
their homeland. The hard-line attitudes among some of these refugees also
fed into a vicious gangland-style power struggle between Sunni and Shiite
Muslims for control of the city's religious institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Like many here, Yusuf blames Karachi's troubles on the international
community, which, he says, abandoned Pakistan and the region after Soviet
troops pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "We were stupidly compassionate people [to take in so many Afghan
refugees], and Karachi is paying the price," Yusuf said. "The world let
us down."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many here, however, Yusuf decided to do something about the
increase in crime.</TE>
<TE>   He founded a nongovernmental organization called the Citizens Police
Liaison Committee in 1989 to marshal private sector resources to help law
enforcement agencies fight waves of kidnappings. The committee bought
computers and other equipment that the police otherwise could not have
afforded.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Yusuf insisted that the Pearl case does not
constitute a resurgence of kidnappings. He and others also note that the
apparent kidnapping is different from most snatches here, which are
carefully choreographed affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Police put out feelers through their street informants or even
precinct-level politicians to determine who has the victim and that he is
safe," said Khan, the Herald editor. Then they signal it is time to
negotiate, often via a brief newspaper article describing the family as
"anxious to hear from the kidnappers."</TE>
<TE>   In time, a sum is paid, the victim is released, and the kidnappers
flee. "Karachi kidnappings have been nonviolent and always were about
money," Yusuf said.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, kidnappers take on a Robin Hood dimension,
especially in working-class neighborhoods of a city where the income
disparity between rich and poor is vast. There, people have come to view
abductions as a kind of gunpoint socialism, with the rich giving to the
less affluent kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   While the people of this violence-prone city have expressed shock at
the Pearl case, they are equally appalled by the death threats and the
chaotic, often contradictory string of e-mails directed not to the police
or the journalist's family but to Western and Pakistani news media.</TE>
<TE>   "It has the air of a group that's not quite clear how to do it," noted
Khan, "like the work of a bunch of amateurs."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani law enforcement officials, now assisted by the FBI, seem
uncertain how to read both the death threats and the kidnappers' vague
demands. In interviews, senior police officials base their cautious
optimism about Pearl's eventual fate at least in part on the assumption
that the kidnappers must be after money and therefore want to keep him
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Yusuf, who saw the journalist the day before he vanished, said there
was another cause for optimism--an electronic relationship Pearl had
formed with Bashir Ahmed Shabbir, the alleged intermediary.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd built a rapport in corresponding with Bashir by e-mail," Yusuf
said. "They'd even talk about domestic things, like the fact his
[Pearl's] wife was sick.</TE>
<TE>   "To this man, Daniel was a person who had a wife," Yusuf added. "That
gives me hope he's still alive."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Russia's foreign minister visited this capital city Monday and
pledged to help Afghanistan recover from 23 years of war and instability
that began when the Soviet Union invaded the country.</LD>
<LD>   Igor S. Ivanov met with interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai before
leaving the nation later in the day.</LD>
<LD>   "We plan to play an active role in rebuilding. We will try to
reconstruct some of the facilities built by the Soviet Union, mainly in
energy and other facilities," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Ivanov said that in return for Moscow's help, he had won a promise
from the interim administration not to harbor terrorists or drug
traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has supported the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign in part
because it is also interested in weakening radical Islamic groups. Those
groups include militants fighting in the breakaway Russian republic of
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Since the defeat of the Taliban regime late last year, Russia has sent
workers to Afghanistan to set up a field hospital and led work to reopen
the Salang Tunnel between Kabul and the north. The tunnel was built to
assist the Soviet invasion of December 1979.</TE>

<HD>Users Flip for New Olympic Ski Jumps</HD>
<DH>Athletics: Man-made slopes are praised as aesthetic marvels and
offer U.S. skiers a year-round facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>First, find a big mountain.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake City architect Peter Emerson admits that when his firm was
chosen to design a $25-million ski jump attraction at the XIX Winter
Olympics here, that was the sum total of his knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously," he said, "no one had a lot of experience building ski
jumps."</LD>
<TE>   And so the principals of a medium-sized firm in the habit of building
schools and jails piled into a van for what they dubbed the Ski Jump Tour
of Europe. Five guys, six countries, 14 days, 12 hotels. In their
downtime, the architects from Edwards &amp; Daniels also checked out bobsled
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, with the Winter Games just days away, Emerson stood
atop what is widely acclaimed as the crown jewel of the Utah Olympic Park
here. Braving a 7-degree morning, Emerson brushed snow from his eyes to
better see the world's newest--and highest--ski jump, known universally
as a K120.</TE>
<TE>'Large Hill' Expected to Draw Great Interest</TE>
<TE>   Built in harmony with the hillside, the jump is viewed as an aesthetic
marvel. One of only 10 internationally approved ski jumps in the U.S., it
is expected to boost interest and participation in a sport in which only
about 200 U.S. athletes compete.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes will attain an average of 58 mph on the 38-degree jump, known
here as the "large hill." From the start of the run to the bottom of the
landing hill, the steepest point of the jump is 462 feet, more than a
40-story building. The elevation at the top is 7,323 feet--said to be
higher than any other ski jump on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Adjacent is the newly constructed "normal hill," the K90. It is 168
feet shorter and, with a gradient of 37.5 degrees, only slightly less
steep. Its elevation at the top is 7,221 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "These jumps," said 17-year-old Lindsay Van of Park City, the
fourth-ranked female ski jumper in the world, "are just so awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the jumps started after Salt Lake City lost a bid for
the 1998 Winter Olympics. State officials vowed to show their commitment
to winter sports by building a mountaintop center with a skating oval,
ski jump, bobsled run and luge track. Even before the Olympics, the park
attracted 250,000 visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   When Utah got the green light for the 2002 Olympics, the state opted
to upgrade the plans for the Games and for future generations of
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to create a legacy, a facility that could operate
year-round," said Emerson. "And also to avoid having a white elephant
after the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>Wal-Mart Lot Offers Prime View of Jumps</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the new jumps, more than 400,000 cubic yards of rock
and dirt had to be excavated. Blasting the mountainside turned into a
spectacle for residents who discovered that the parking lot of Wal-Mart
affords a glorious view of the jump.</TE>
<TE>   "People would come out with their beers and just watch us blast," said
Ranch Kimball, director of construction for Utah's permanent Olympic
venues.</TE>
<TE>   Situating the jumps was only one of the challenges facing Emerson and
his colleagues. Scattered across the landscape were tiny wooden
chalet-type structures, built to house equipment, power sources and, in
some cases, athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson's architectural team came up with a more modern image: steel,
concrete and glass buildings as spare and functional as the mountains
around them. The roofs curve like wings--or like ski jumpers in
midflight. A sports museum Emerson and his crew put on the property and
all the outbuildings associated with the sports events echo the ski
jumps' simple splendor.</TE>
<TE>   The broader metaphor, said Emerson, was a machine.</TE>
<TE>   "You think about that jump, it is a machine," he said, "a machine that
a jumper can take advantage of. It is an extension of the jumpers' skis."</TE>
<TE>   The big jump accentuates the mountainside, especially at night when it
is lighted and visible from miles away. Despite its drama, Emerson
stressed that the jump "is not a monument. It is a structure designed for
a specific purpose. That is its signature."</TE>
<TE>   The architects and engineers decided to carve into the mountain rather
than projecting outward. This approach kept the jump from becoming an
environmental eyesore, Emerson said, "sticking out of the ground,
towering over its surroundings, like the jump in Calgary [Canadian site
of the 1988 Winter Games]. That was not our intent here."</TE>
<TE>   Changes in standards and technology also came into play. High-tech
materials--such as a ceramic track and plastic sheathing that make a jump
as easy to use in summer as in winter--had to be included.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there were foot and vehicular traffic patterns to
address, since the Olympic organizing committee in Salt Lake decided to
break with tradition and place the ski jumps next to the luge and bobsled
runs. At most Olympics, the venues for those events have been separate.
Putting them together meant bigger audiences--and more congestion.</TE>
<TE>   But the main obstacle was the thin air. Ski jumps abound in Europe,
where the sport is so popular that one recent competition attracted
100,000 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Most jumps in Europe are in big cities at sea level. Even in Europe's
mountains, a ski jump's base elevation tends to be low, 2,000 to 3,000
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The design team here aimed to turn the air into an asset. The K120's
"flying V" pattern allows jumpers to use the air, Emerson said,
explaining: "It creates more wind surface."</TE>
<TE>   But former Olympian Joe Lamb, the leading U.S. specialist on ski
jumping, said the altitude of the Utah jumps makes the air density
significantly lower than most jumpers are accustomed to.</TE>
<TE>   "Aerodynamics plays a huge, huge part in the flight trajectory of the
athletes," Lamb said. "I think these jumps will be challenging to many of
the competitors because they're not used to jumping at this altitude."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lamb maintained that the new specifications make the Utah jumps
the safest in the world. He predicted they will attract one of the
largest audiences at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   And, said Lamb, "These jumps will be a great asset to American ski
jumping in the future, I can guarantee you that."</TE>
<TE>   Days before the Games begin, Emerson said it feels as if five years of
design effort flew by. The ski jump, he said, can take care of itself
now. Down to the wire, the unglamorous essentials of the job consume
Emerson's 14-hour days: Will the toilets work? Will the food concession
areas function properly?</TE>
<TE>   Those involved in the project like to say they have accrued a vast
body of knowledge about something they will never have to do again. Oh,
well, Emerson shrugged, something else will come along. Meanwhile, as he
watched jumpers fly off the K120, was he tempted to try it himself?</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like fun," he said. "But at this point, I think I'll pass."</TE>

<HD>'Trusted' Air Travelers Would Minimize Wait</HD>
<DH>Security: Passengers who voluntarily agree to a background check
could be issued a special credential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former President Reagan liked to say "trust, but verify," and now
the travel industry says a variation on that folksy proverb could
substantially shrink airport security lines--perhaps by 25% or more.</LD>
<LD>   Airlines, airports and business travel groups say passengers who
voluntarily agree to a background check should be issued a special
credential that can be verified prior to boarding by a computerized
fingerprint check or some other high-tech means.</LD>
<LD>   These "trusted travelers" would be entitled to speed through special
express security lanes and bypass random searches. Meanwhile, other
passengers left in the regular lines could reap significant collateral
benefits.</LD>
<TE>   That's because a small pool of very frequent fliers accounts for a
lopsidedly large proportion of passengers. The 5% of travelers who take
10 or more trips a year--about 4 million people--represent a minimum of
25% of the passengers boarding flights, according to an estimate by The
Times from government and industry data.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can take one out of four people and move them out of those
lines, that changes the dynamics for both passenger groups considerably,"
said Dean Headley, a business professor at Wichita State University who
monitors the quality of airline service. "If this ID can have that as its
principal benefit for giving up some personal privacy, then it should
fly, and fly real well."</TE>
<TE>   However, before a trusted traveler program can help unsnarl airport
lines, the new federal Transportation Security Administration faces many
unanswered questions about how to make it work without creating more
security loopholes--or infringing on civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Would the government or a private entity run the program? How much
information would applicants have to disclose? Could the program be
compromised by terrorists who burrow into U.S. society? What criteria
would determine who gets a card? Could a prospective employer demand to
see it? What if a cardholder subsequently commits a violent crime--would
that person lose the privilege? What kind of technology would verify a
trusted traveler's identity at the airport? What about lost cards? How
much would it cost?</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which is also expanding a passenger profiling program
already used by the airlines to detect possible security risks, has taken
a cautious, noncommittal approach to the trusted traveler concept.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good idea to explore," transportation security chief John
Magaw told the House aviation subcommittee at a recent hearing, but "I
don't have any authority to step out there and agree to that." Magaw
indicated it could take quite a while to properly design a trusted
traveler program, and the agency has many other pressing priorities, such
as hiring 30,000 federal security screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, some security officials worry that the wrong people could
be issued a trusted traveler card. Their worst-case scenario involves a
terrorist "sleeper cell" whose members are willing to devote years to
building up an innocuous profile.</TE>
<TE>   The travel industry finds itself in a predicament. It needs the
government's support and participation to go forward with the idea. But
pushing Magaw and his agency, as they scramble to meet a long list of
congressionally mandated deadlines this year, may backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is saying this is a low priority," said Marianne
McInerney, executive director of the National Business Travel Assn.,
which represents major corporate travel departments. "What the travelers
are saying is that this is an important part of their getting back on the
planes. It absolutely is a source of frustration for the business
traveler."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, civil liberties groups have been warning that such a
program would constitute an unwelcome government intrusion in what
essentially remains a private commercial transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those objections may eventually be overcome because the card
would be strictly voluntary. "I would probably be willing to tell the
government a lot of things about myself as long as they would be treated
confidentially," said Mark Greenfield, a Los Angeles lawyer who flies on
business two or three times a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be delighted [if] they would have a way of knowing that I am
one of the good guys," added Greenfield, who said he has been wanded,
patted down, asked to take his shoes off and had his carry-on articles
hand-searched many times during security checks since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Working out security concerns and practical questions about how a
program would work may ultimately prove to be a far bigger challenge than
the civil liberties issues. Some officials say they can understand how a
trusted traveler program would help airlines sell seats, but they are not
convinced that it would enhance security.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn., which represents most major airlines and has
taken the lead in lobbying for the idea, says it is keenly sensitive to
such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no system that will be put in place that is 100% foolproof,"
acknowledged Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the industry group. But he
added: "The primary reason we are doing it is to know more about the
people who are seeking to board our aircraft. It's a security tool;
customer service is a secondary benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Yet customer service should also be a high priority, said Charles
Barclay, head of the American Assn. of Airport Executives. "Right now,
going through a two-hour line means you might not take a two-day trip,"
Barclay said. "We've got to get efficiency back into it."</TE>
<TE>   Technology does not seem to be an obstacle to setting up a trusted
traveler program. There is no shortage of proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Barclay's group has called for using U.S. passports as the foundation.
"Passport Plus" holders also would agree to an interview and to being
screened against a new database of security information, which would be
maintained by a private, nonprofit entity. A digitally encoded
fingerprint could be used to double-check a passenger's identity at the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   A Minnesota company, Laser Data Command Inc., has created a card that
would work with bar code readers already used by the airlines. The
"PassPro" would encode a personal image and fingerprint, as well as data
from identification documents and even an image of the passenger's bags.
A video camera also would encode the passenger's image on the boarding
pass and luggage tags at check-in. Security personnel would simply need
to match the images.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to tell the airlines whether you're late on your
Sears payment," said John Barclay, president of the company and no
relation to the airport industry official. "We're trying to move people,
not look at their dirty underwear."</TE>
<TE>   At Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, an American company
has installed a trusted traveler system that has cut check-in time from
two hours to 15 minutes. The "Express Entry" program has been in place
since 1998, and 80,000 individuals are enrolled, representing about 15%
of the airport's passenger traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Created by Texas-based EDS, the system relies on a digital measurement
of hand geometry to identify trusted travelers. Bret Kidd, an EDS vice
president, said similar technology could be in place at the top 20
airports in the United States by the end of the year, if the government
agrees to it.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it could eventually handle as much as 50% of the passenger
volume, but surely in the range of 30% to 50%," said Kidd. "At
Ben-Gurion, the individual passenger pays $20 to $25 a year to be part of
this program. We think there would be a willingness on the part of
passengers to do something like that in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Passengers in Israel apply in person for the program. They submit to a
background check and their hand is scanned by a machine. If approved,
they receive a card with about 90 hand measurements encoded on a chip. At
the airport, passengers go to a special kiosk, insert their card and have
their hand measured again to verify their identity.</TE>
<TE>   Just because the security program works in Israel, it doesn't
automatically mean it can be smoothly adapted in the United States.
Israel is a much smaller country, and most of its air travelers are
international passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet to Greenfield, the Los Angeles lawyer and frequent flier, the
concept seems logical because it is simply a mirror image of current
profiling systems to spot security risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I would argue to you that it is a good idea to profile," he said.
"This is a much cleaner and perhaps politically correct way to do it: You
profile to find the good people."</TE>

<HD>Donor Pulls Funds for Exhibit at Smithsonian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A promised $38-million donation to the Smithsonian Institution was
withdrawn Monday, forcing the cancellation of a planned new exhibit that
critics alleged damaged the institution's integrity.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came less than three weeks after 170 activists and
scholars complained that Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence Small, the
institution's chief executive, has commercialized the museums.</LD>
<LD>   The Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation pledged the money in May,
earmarked for a "Spirit of America" exhibition to honor as many as 100
prominent Americans. It had been scheduled to open in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   The now-scrapped 10,000-square-foot exhibit was to highlight Americans
that included ice skater Dorothy Hamill, basketball legend Michael Jordan
and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. When the donation was
announced, Small called it "an extraordinary gift."</TE>
<TE>   The Smithsonian's long-held policy dictates that it and not sponsors
control the timing, content and intent of exhibitions. In a statement,
Marc Pachter, acting director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of
American History, said the "Spirit of America" project "was being
developed in strict accordance with Smithsonian standards."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post quoted Reynolds' letter as saying criticism of the
exhibit's focus on individuals rather than groups by Smithsonian staff
was the main reason she changed her mind.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "the nation's attic," the Smithsonian was established in 1846
with a bequest by Briton James Smithson. It is an independent trust,
comprising 16 museums and galleries and the National Zoo in Washington
and research facilities in the United States and abroad. It holds more
than 140 million artifacts and specimens and is a center for research and
scholarship in the arts, sciences and history.</TE>
<TE>   A letter the complaining group sent last month to Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, chancellor of the Smithsonian's ruling Board of
Regents, demanded that Small be fired.</TE>
<TE>   The statement issued by Pachter gave no reason for the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have to talk to the donor about that, what their reasons
are," Smithsonian spokesman David Umansky said.</TE>
<TE>   The Post, however, quoted Reynolds as saying in her letter:</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, the basic philosophy for the exhibit--the power of the
individual to make a difference--is the antithesis of that espoused by
many within the Smithsonian bureaucracy, which is only movements and
institutions make a difference, not individuals."</TE>

<HD>Purse Strings Looser in New Climate</HD>
<DH>Spending: Congress has plenty of reasons for letting the ledger
sheet go out of balance again, chiefly war, recession and an election
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Let the spending spree begin.</LD>
<LD>   Congress received President Bush's budget Monday in a political and
fiscal climate that has precious few incentives for lawmakers to exercise
fiscal discipline.</LD>
<LD>   It is an election year. War and recession have loosened purse strings.
And even Bush is saying other matters now are more important than keeping
the government in the black.</LD>
<TE>   That's a big departure from the trend of the last two decades. Since
the mid-1980s, federal budget policy has been guided by the goals of
reducing the deficit and balancing the budget, even if progress toward
those priorities was not always steady.</TE>
<TE>   There are still some in Congress who are trying to cling to the mantra
of fiscal restraint, including House Republicans who are urging their
leaders to pass a balanced budget this year, even as Bush has proposed
one with an $80-billion deficit. Some of these conservatives fear that
Bush's proposed 8% increase in discretionary programs may be an
invitation to spend more, not less.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the floor, not the ceiling, for where spending is heading in
2002," said Stephen Moore, head of the conservative political group Club
for Growth.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Congress is likely to give Bush the big spending increases he
seeks for defense and homeland security. Meanwhile, many of the spending
reductions he proposes are in areas Congress is unlikely to cut, such as
highway funding, environmental programs and home-state projects of key
lawmakers. And if Congress overspends Bush's budget, it may be harder for
Bush to hold the line.</TE>
<TE>   "He is saying, in effect, that deficits don't matter for everything I
want to do, but they matter for everything you want to do," said Robert
Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget
analysis group. "It takes some of the moral authority away from the case
for fiscal discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Deficit foes may win in one area: Bush's proposal to pass another
round of tax cuts to stimulate the economy is expected to die soon.
Momentum behind congressional action has slowed to a crawl as the economy
has shown signs of improvement and the Senate has remained deadlocked
over the issue for months. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
has scheduled a showdown vote Wednesday and is likely to pull the bill
if, as expected, the impasse is not broken.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's budget request marks the formal beginning of Congress' process
for setting government tax and spending policy. The next step is for the
House and Senate to pass a budget resolution setting broad tax and
spending targets, which will guide Congress in writing detailed spending
bills later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Republicans hailed Bush's budget, even though a sizable
faction of House conservatives is uneasy with running the deficits it
projects. Some are urging GOP leaders to write a budget resolution that
is in balance--a feat they think can be accomplished if, as many expect,
no economic stimulus legislation is enacted. Of the $80-billion deficit
Bush projects for 2003, $77 billion is attributable to the stimulus bill.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of pushing a balanced GOP budget was discussed late last week
at a party retreat of House Republicans, and it has the backing of the
powerful House majority whip, Tom DeLay (R-Texas). But House Budget
Committee Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) said it would be hard to do that
and still accommodate Bush's priorities in defense, homeland security and
economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. argued that the
new era of deficits would be brief and that surpluses would return
quickly when the economy rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about House Republican pressure to produce a balanced budget,
Daniels said: "We appreciate their concern that we get back to balance as
soon as possible. With economic growth, that will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are trying to seize the mantle of fiscal responsibility by
criticizing Bush for ushering in a new round of budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to put this country back in the mode of unending
deficits year after year," said Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.), senior
Democrat on the House Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats are in a political box when it comes to proposing a way
to return to surpluses. Most are unlikely to fight big budget increases
for defense and homeland security. But they also want to add back money
Bush proposed cutting in popular domestic programs, especially in an
election year in which control of Congress is at stake. But most
Democrats do not want to push for a rollback of last year's tax cut to
reduce the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Pressures to increase spending also are exacerbated because, for the
first time in decades, Congress is operating without budget-law curbs
that have helped limit spending in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Congress was restrained to some extent by a law that
forced automatic budget cuts if deficits exceeded specified targets. New
limits were imposed by a 1990 budget law. Especially important was a
"pay-as-you-go" requirement that any bill that reduced revenue or
increased entitlement spending had to be coupled with offsetting deficit
reduction measures.</TE>
<TE>   Those strictures were extended when Congress passed the 1997
budget-balancing law. And as the deficit vanished even more quickly than
expected, members of both parties agreed to a new, even more stringent
fiscal limit: that the budget would be balanced without using Social
Security surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   All that is gone this year. The consensus behind keeping Social
Security in a "lockbox" shattered under the weight of war and recession.
And the pay-as-you-go law and budget limits expire this year.</TE>
<TE>   That means a Bush veto may be the last tool of fiscal discipline left
in Washington. But it's not clear how effective his veto threat would be.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent weeks, the White House has seemingly flaunted its deficits,
virtually taking pride in the fact that it was willing to throw aside
fiscal discipline because events warranted," said Stanley Collender, a
budget expert at the public relations firm of Fleishman-Hillard. "If a
president as popular as Bush is not worrying about long-term deficits
this year, it is hard to see too many people on Capitol Hill fretting
much either."</TE>
<TE>   That's particularly worrisome to fiscal conservatives who were none
too happy that Bush allowed big spending hikes in last year's budget as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "If these spending increases continue, Bush is in danger of being
remembered as a big-spending president rather than a tax-cutting
president," said Chris Edwards, director of fiscal policy at the Cato
Institute, a libertarian research group.</TE>

<HD>Social Security Takes on Role of a Cash Cow</HD>
<DH>Budget: A critic says Bush's plan 'abandons fiscal discipline.'
Others consider it an appropriate response to a 'national emergency.'</DH>

<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In the budget he delivered Monday, President Bush relies on one
source of new money more than any other to pay for his proposals: the
trillions of dollars in Social Security funds being set aside for the
start of the baby boom retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Although Bush and his aides warned in advance that the war on terror
and the need for homeland defense would require dipping into the Social
Security surplus and running deficits for a few years, the dimensions of
what the administration had in mind were not apparent until the unveiling
of the $2.13-trillion spending plan for fiscal 2003. The measure took the
breath away from some Democrats and independent analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "The president is requiring the use of Social Security to pay for the
normal operations of government," said Robert D. Reischauer, president of
the nonpartisan Urban Institute and a Washington budget veteran. "That's
the most significant, and largely unrecognized, change he's making."</LD>
<TE>   Declared Citigroup vice chairman and former Clinton administration
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin: "This country is ill-served by
abandoning fiscal discipline and this [budget] abandons fiscal
discipline. It's the opposite of what was accomplished in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, that opinion was not universally shared, and no one
claimed there was any danger to current retirees' benefits. Former
Democratic Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, who co-chaired a recent commission on
Social Security for Bush, said: "My own view is that this is a war
budget. This is a national emergency and the president is responding."</TE>
<TE>$150-Billion Deficit Each Year for a Decade</TE>
<TE>   Still, many analysts expressed surprise, both at the extent of
deficits in the new Bush budget and its extensive use of Social Security
money to cover them. What most surprised them:</TE>
<TE>   * Far from running only a few years of deficits, the new budget
assumes that the government's so-called "on-budget" spending, which
covers everything from maintaining a military to subsidizing Amtrak, will
run $150 billion or more in the red each year for the next decade,
according to documents and White House officials.</TE>
<TE>   * Instead of covering the bulk of the costs with expanding income tax
revenue that can be expected with the resumption of economic growth, the
plan relies heavily on Social Security money to nudge the overall
budget--which includes on- and off-budget spending, such as payments to
retirees--into the black by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   * Although the president argues that the chief reason the nation must
run in the red is to pursue the war on terror, his budget calls for new
tax cuts--over and above the 10-year, $1.3-trillion package approved last
year--equal to or greater than the new defense spending he seeks. The
plan includes $590 billion in additional tax cuts over 10 years, but only
$550 billion in new defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody concedes that deficit spending, if it is in response to an
emergency like Sept. 11, is not a bad thing," said Robert Bixby,
executive director of the anti-deficit Concord Coalition. "But what's
astounding is that this goes way beyond what was [once] a strong
political consensus to save the Social Security surpluses."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, before the September attacks, the president was at the center
of that consensus. In addressing a joint session of Congress only one
year ago, he declared that "to make sure the retirement savings of
America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget
protects all . . . of the Social Security surplus for Social Security,
and for Social Security alone." His pledge was considered critical to
winning congressional passage of his $1.3-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush and his aides appear to have decided that they cannot pursue
their new military and homeland defense goals, protect the president's
already approved tax cuts and maintain the Social Security surplus. And
they apparently think there is little political cost to giving up on the
surplus pledge.</TE>
<TE>   In part, that's because there is no immediate danger to retirees'
checks. The system expects to collect more than $700 billion in revenue
this fiscal year and pay out only about $470 billion in benefits. But
analysts warn that failure to keep running surpluses and paying off
federal debt will leave the country in a painful bind as baby boomers
retire in growing numbers, and will burden the smaller generation of
workers that follows with rising Social Security tax costs.</TE>
<TE>   "By paying down the debt, we were increasing national savings,
reducing the upward pressure on mortgages and corporate debt, and cutting
the government's own interest bill," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts drew the analogy to a couple paying off their home mortgage
before retiring in order to cut monthly costs and save. They said that
Washington was making the payoff in the nick of time because boomers are
expected to begin leaving the work force in substantial numbers around
the end of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin and other analysts said that the administration's sudden lurch
into deficits demonstrates that last year's tax cuts were more than the
country could afford, and that any further cuts would compound the
problem. "They're unwise and unjustified," said Reischauer.</TE>
<TE>   But it was unclear Monday whether congressional Democrats will find
the political spine to oppose a president with sky-high public approval
ratings in the midst of a war on terror.</TE>
<TE>Democrats Bedeviled by Budget Needs</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Hill Democrats criticized Bush for submitting a budget that
goes into deficit, but they offered no suggestions about how to bring it
back into the black.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the lawmakers suggested they would support policies that
would make the deficit even bigger: While supporting Bush's increases in
defense and homeland security, Democrats opposed offsetting cuts in
highway, environmental and other domestic programs. At the same time,
Democrats insisted they would not seek a tax increase or rollback of last
year's tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   About all that congressional Democrats would offer were ideas for
curbing future tax cuts. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad
(D-N.D.) said that the Democrats' budget proposal may include a "trigger"
that would turn off future cuts or spending increases if the tax revenue
to pay for them do not materialize.</TE>

<DH>Homeland: White House proposes spending $37.7 billion, nearly
double the current outlay, for 'first steps.'</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal funding for aviation security would triple. Spending to
defend against bioterrorist attacks would quadruple. And money to help
police and firefighters respond to calamities would increase more than
tenfold.</LD>
<LD>   Those details are part of the first-ever homeland security budget that
was folded into the Bush administration spending plan released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The $37.7-billion proposal for the 2003 fiscal year--nearly double
what is now being spent--reflects a consensus desire in Washington to do
everything possible to protect Americans from terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   But the proposal is only a beginning for a spending category that
seems likely to grow in coming years. White House Office of Homeland
Security Director Thomas J. Ridge, whose position Bush created in the
weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, described the measures as "important,
substantive first steps."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge told reporters that he is drafting a new national strategy for
homeland security, which he expects to deliver to Bush by midyear. That
review could spur far more sweeping proposals in fiscal 2004 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is likely to have many of its own costly ideas as well.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, many lawmakers were clamoring to add funding for
homeland security, including proposals for defending roads, bridges and
power plants and bolstering the public health system.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration beat back those requests, but they are likely
to be raised anew.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics in Congress, however, say that a comprehensive assessment
of where the nation is most vulnerable and what should be done about it
is overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have a well-developed, clearly articulated strategy for
homeland defense," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice).</TE>
<TE>   Of the new budget proposals, Harman said: "There are some good ideas.
But what is missing is organization. Have they picked the right four or
five subjects? Are they the ones where we are at highest risk?"</TE>
<TE>   Monday's homeland security budget represents a collection of programs
from agencies across the government, including the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the departments of Defense, Justice and
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing attention to the initiative, the administration put a
Minuteman logo on every page in the budget in which an agency had a
mission related to homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   One major focus was bioterrorism. To help safeguard the public from
biological attacks, such as the anthrax outbreaks that killed five people
last year, the administration proposed spending $5.9 billion, up from
$1.4 billion currently.</TE>
<TE>   The money would help in four key areas, according to the Bush
proposal:</TE>
<TE>   * Helping state and local health systems respond to attacks.
Hospitals, for instance, would get $591 million to improve communications
systems, install decontamination facilities and set up regional plans.</TE>
<TE>   * Improving research and development in the hunt for vaccines,
diagnostic tests and rapid identification of deadly pathogens.</TE>
<TE>   * Adding resources for the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile, a
collection of medicines that could help millions of victims in a
biological attack.</TE>
<TE>   * Strengthening interagency communications. A new information system,
for example, would link emergency medical responders with public health
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Another focus was additional funding for so-called "first responders."</TE>
<TE>   As previously announced, the budget includes $3.5 billion to help
police and firefighters, up from a mere $291 million in the current
fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   A third priority, aviation security, would increase to $4.8 billion in
the next year from $1.5 billion now. Much of the new money would go to
hire thousands of new federal security workers at major airports across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on homeland security could have ripple effects throughout
the government. After all, $37.7 billion is more than the budgets of many
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In the Justice Department--which is to receive almost $26 billion in
the new budget--the proposed counter-terrorism budget would increase by
$2 billion, or 144% from the current year. But some local law-enforcement
programs that have been popular in California and elsewhere could suffer.</TE>
<TE>   One of the big law-enforcement losers in Bush's proposal is the
community-oriented policing services program, or COPS, a staple of the
Clinton era that has provided local police departments with money to hire
more officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush plan would slash funding for the hiring of new officers by
$370 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department believes that the program has met its goal of
providing funds for 100,000 new officers and that money could be better
spent elsewhere, a senior department official said.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional supporters of the program say that the 100,000 goal
has not in fact been met, and they promised a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials insisted Monday that they are not
abandoning local governments and will be shifting their resources
elsewhere, but they acknowledged that fighting terrorism must now be the
"No. 1 priority" at all levels of government.</TE>
<TE>   "Defending the citizens of America against terrorist attacks is the
first and overriding priority of the Department of Justice," and the
budget plan reflects that new reality, said Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>

<HD>Defense Increase Biggest Since '66</HD>
<DH>Pentagon: Rumsfeld says the increase is needed to fund the nation's
role as global peacekeeper.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House on Monday unveiled a mammoth $379-billion budget
for the Pentagon that is expected to provide a bounty of expanded
resources for intelligence agencies but otherwise relatively little new
funding for the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The budget calls for a $48-billion overall increase in defense
spending, a 14% jump that represents the largest percentage increase
since the United States escalated its involvement in the Vietnam War in
1966.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the increase was necessary
to put the United States on firm financial footing for its role as global
peacekeeper.</LD>
<TE>   "The defense budget is cheap when one compares it to putting our
security at risk, our lives at risk, our country at risk," Rumsfeld said.
"The United States of America, at this moment in history, is the country
that is capable of contributing to peace and stability on this globe in
an enormously important way."</TE>
<TE>   But less than half of the proposed increase would cover war-related
costs. Most is set aside for pay raises for soldiers and an assortment of
existing programs that have grown more expensive. Inflation alone would
consume $6.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when President Bush has stressed that the war on terrorism
is only beginning, some in Congress expressed disappointment that more
money hadn't been set aside for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Norman Dicks (D-Wash.), a member of the House Appropriations
Committee, complained that the budget doesn't provide the Pentagon with
resources to replace aging equipment. He said he would seek more funding
to buy new technology for the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have to go into Iraq, I don't think we're prepared," Dicks
said. "It's a budget that's out of whack, and we're not fixing the major
problems."</TE>
<TE>   The budget does expand funding for high-technology equipment that has
proven valuable in Afghanistan. About $1 billion is earmarked for the
purchase of additional unmanned planes, such as the Predator and the
Globalhawk, and $83 million would fund development of an unmanned
submarine.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials also said Monday that the nation's spy agencies
are poised to receive billions of dollars in additional funding for the
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on espionage agencies is classified. Figures are diced and
distributed among hundreds of innocuous entries across the Pentagon
budget to prevent outsiders from deciphering spending levels and
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush made it clear in his State of the Union address
last week that improved intelligence-gathering would be a top budget
priority. And intelligence analysts said there were some indications in
the budget that the CIA and other agencies could see record increases.</TE>
<TE>   John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, a Virginia-based
intelligence research firm, noted that an obscure line item hidden in the
Air Force budget calls for an additional $1.9 billion in spending on
"selected activities"--language that he said has previously served as
budgeting code for the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Though a significant portion of that money is traditionally earmarked
for the National Reconnaissance Office--the agency that operates the
nation's spy satellite network--Pike said the bulk of the new funds is
likely to go to the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's basically [CIA Director] George Tenet getting a war
chest for covert operations to go hunt terrorists," Pike said, adding
that he expected spending on intelligence to surpass $40 billion in the
new budget, up from about $35 billion currently.</TE>
<TE>   A CIA spokesman declined to comment, but congressional sources
familiar with the intelligence budget confirmed that the CIA and other
agencies were in line for "substantial increases" for the fiscal year
that begins in October. Congress recently approved an approximate 8%
increase in the intelligence budget for the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the nation's intelligence budget pays for satellites and
other high-tech collections equipment operated by such spy shops as the
National Imagery and Mapping Agency, which directs imagery satellites,
and the National Security Agency, which intercepts all manner of
communications signals.</TE>
<TE>   But spending at the CIA--the only agency that deploys human spies
around the globe--also has soared since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The agency is on a hiring binge," said one U.S. official, who
declined to be identified. The CIA is adding "not only operations
officers," he said, "but analysts and technical people, scientists and
engineers."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA also is spending a great deal of money training and equipping
the intelligence agencies of other countries, including Pakistan, that
have provided crucial information in Afghanistan, Indonesia and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on intelligence accounts for only a tiny fraction of a
Pentagon budget so enormous that the proposed $48-million increase alone
outstrips the military spending by any other nation. The next-largest
national defense budget, Japan's, is $45.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The budget lists $19.4 billion in war-related costs, including $9.4
billion to replace ammunition and related costs stemming from the war in
Afghanistan and a $10-billion contingency fund.</TE>
<TE>   Answering the criticism of military analysts who argue that the budget
adds new programs but cuts few, Pentagon officials have taken pains to
note their sacrifices. The Navy would build just five ships under the
budget, fewer than would be needed to replace those that go out of
service. Missile defense remains at its 2002 level.</TE>
<TE>   Congress delayed the next round of base closures from 2003 to 2005.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Appointee to Civil Rights Agency</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Monday rejected the Bush administration's most
recent appointment to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, backing the
agency's majority against the White House in an increasingly partisan
fight over the agency's role and direction.</LD>
<LD>   In a 20-minute oral ruling, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said
there was no place on the commission for Peter Kirsanow, a conservative
Cleveland lawyer whom Bush named in December, because the term of
commissioner Victoria Wilson, an independent who often sympathized with
the panel's Democrats, had not expired.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson was appointed in January 2000 by President Clinton to replace a
deceased commission member. In Monday's ruling, Kessler found that Wilson
had the right to serve a full six-year term even though her letter of
commission expired Nov. 29, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department immediately promised to appeal the decision,
which would add another round to a political scrimmage that has reached
beyond an appointment to a $9-million federal agency that investigates
complaints and issues reports but has no enforcement powers.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-member commission is at a 5-3 tilt that favors liberals and
chairwoman Mary Frances Berry. Kirsanow's appointment would put the
commission at a 4-4 split. Beyond the issue of the panel's composition
are disputes over its role. Conservatives believe it should be more of an
academic data-collection agency; liberals say it should keep looking into
complaints of civil rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Berry, long a critic of Republican administrations, was sharply
critical of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's younger brother, for
his role in that state's presidential balloting in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, Kessler said her ruling was based on the "plain language" of
the 1994 Civil Rights Act, which reads that "the term of each
[commission] member shall be six years." A 1983 version of the law had
provided for interim and temporary appointments. But when the House
Judiciary Committee struck that language from the 1994 statute, Kessler
said, it signaled that those provisions no longer existed.</TE>
<TE>   "On the basis of the first and foremost principle, the text shows that
commissioners are to serve six-year terms," Kessler said.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) underwent successful surgery Monday
night to remove a small melanoma from his nose, a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix took about an hour to
remove a skin lesion less than one centimeter in size from the left side
of McCain's nose that was considered to be "the earliest form of
melanoma," the statement said. He received a local anesthetic.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no indication of malignancy, nor was there," McCain told
reporters outside his Phoenix home. "But it's something that's important
to detect early and get rid of early."</LD>
<TE>   McCain, 65, is Arizona's senior senator and a former presidential
candidate. He will undergo a 90-minute procedure today to cover the scar
from the removal of the melanoma, the spokesman said.</TE>
