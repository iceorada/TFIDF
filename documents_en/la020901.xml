<LD>A family vacation in Washington, D.C., a few years ago became the
inspiration for the PBS children's series "Liberty's Kids," which
will premiere Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I was with my wife and kids, showing them around the city,"
recalls Andy Heyward, chairman of DIC Entertainment, the children's
entertainment company producing the series. "I rediscovered history
through their eyes as I would explain to them the various monuments
and institutions of our government. There are a lot of educational
shows we have produced that range from environment to geography, but
not on American history. Nothing has ever been done on American
history."</LD>
<LD>   The animated series features the adventures of three youngsters --
15-year-olds James and Sarah and 8-year-old Henri--who work as
apprentices in Ben Franklin's print shop in Philadelphia in the
mid-1770s, just as America is struggling to become independent from
England.</LD>
<TE>   "They are kind of 'Zelig'-like in that they travel throughout the
times and report on various stories going on during the American
Revolution," says Heyward. "The underscore of every show is freedom
of the press, freedom of speech and human rights, democracy versus
totalitarianism and freedom of religion."</TE>
<TE>   Walter Cronkite supplies the voice of Benjamin Franklin; Annette
Bening, Billy Crystal, Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg, Dustin
Hoffman and Sylvester Stallone are among the other celebrities
lending their vocal talents.</TE>
<TE>   Heyward enlisted the services of Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
Jack Rakov, a professor at Stanford, as consultant. "He goes through
every one of our scripts and authenticates it," says Heyward. "This
is not 'Scooby-Doo.' We have to be accurate with everything we say.
We are introducing kids to these very important, cherished values."</TE>
<TE>   Both PBS and DIC agreed that "Liberty's Kids" shouldn't shy away
from showing what life was really like in America at the end of the
18th century.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to tell the whole story," he says. "There was slavery
going on then. We didn't want to do some sugar cane version of
American history."</TE>
<TE>   "Liberty's Kids" is just one of the new series for kids this fall.

<HD>Redwoods Siphon Water From the Top and Bottom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON THOMPSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JEDEDIAH SMITH REDWOODS STATE PARK, Calif. -- Researchers showed four
years ago that California's coastal redwoods create their own "rain"
by condensing heavy fog into drenching showers to nourish their roots
during the region's dry summers.</LD>
<LD>   This summer, they're finding that the world's tallest trees'
immense upper stories drink from the sky itself, sucking water
directly from the clouds that shroud the coast much of the dry
season.</LD>
<LD>   That helps explain how trees 37 stories tall can move enough water
from their roots to feed branches and needles nearly twice as high as
the Statue of Liberty.</LD>
<TE>   The answer, apparently, is that they don't have to: the branches
and needles get much of their moisture from the air itself.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are trying to quantify how much moisture the branches
and needles absorb. But plant ecologist Todd Dawson of UC Berkeley
already knows: "It's a bunch."</TE>
<TE>   The ability to siphon water upward against gravity and friction is
thought to be one of the most limiting factors in how tall trees can
grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Theory says you can't transport water that high," Dawson said.
"Yet trees do it all the time. We want to understand how."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are discovering that the giant trees can alter their
environments, both on the ground and in their complex canopies
hundreds of feet in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "You essentially have two ends that take in water -- at the top
and the bottom," Dawson said. "That breaks all the rules ... and may
explain how they can achieve these great heights."</TE>
<TE>   Some redwoods have lived since the days of Jesus Christ. With
time, their immense, complex canopies trap needles, dust and seeds,
creating peaty soil mats a yard thick and as big as a bus that grow
plants, sustain animals and absorb water hundreds of feet above the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, you get this huge sponge that builds up," said Steve
Sillett, a Humboldt State professor who began studying the phenomena
in redwoods in 1996. "During most of the year, it's an aquatic
environment up there" fed by rain and fog.</TE>
<TE>   He's discovered mollusks, crustaceans and other animals ordinarily
found in stream beds -- even the wandering salamander, which lacks
lungs and must stay moist to absorb oxygen through its skin.</TE>
<TE>   Like trees in the Pacific Northwest and other temperate rain
forests and cloud forests, the redwoods sprout canopy roots from
their branches that Sillett believes take in water and nutrients from
the hidden gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't have to suck it all the way up from the ground,"
Humboldt graduate student Anthony Ambrose said.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose and other researchers hauled thousands of pounds of
solar-powered monitoring equipment, cables and frames into the
canopies of 18 redwoods from the Oregon border about 350 miles south
to Santa Cruz County.</TE>
<TE>   They inserted probes to measure sap flow speed and direction.
Other instruments measure temperature, light, relative humidity, wind
and rain.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the researchers will climb the trees again, this time
carrying laptop computers to retrieve data collected over the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   To get there, they shoot an arrow threaded with fishing line over
one of the tree's highest branches, then haul up stronger ropes. They
climb the ropes in ascenders and harnesses, and attach pulleys to
pull up the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Even the tallest redwoods are still growing as much as a foot a
year, pushing the limits of height, Sillett said -- but that's
because conditions are good now.</TE>
<TE>   During the next drought, the redwoods' tops will wither -- only to
regenerate when conditions improve once more, a cycle repeated
countless times over the trees' millennial lives.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are starting to use those cycles to track El Nino, La
Nina and other weather patterns -- potentially even global warming --
back hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   "What's locked up in that tree ring could be a key to those
environmental changes," Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The giant trees are remnants from the days of the dinosaurs. They
grow only along California's fog belt, a narrow 500-mile band that
toes into southern Oregon, where the difference between ocean and air
temperatures generates fog much of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's earlier research showed that fog condensation can provide
30% to 40% of a redwood's water supply -- most of it during the
otherwise dry summer months.</TE>
<TE>   The fog and redwoods combine to create a cool, moist environment,
like the cloud forests found in scattered areas throughout the world.
Where the redwoods are removed, water culled from fog drops by as
much as half, Dawson found, and the soil heats up and dries out.</TE>
<TE>   "As you cut the trees, not only are you cutting the fog, you also
change the whole microclimate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Redwoods are the fastest-growing softwood in North America. They
regenerate quickly as shoots sprout off the cut stump, but have
difficulty if the entire canopy is removed, Dawson found. He is
experimenting with how many large trees it takes to make a forest,
research that could discourage commercial clear-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   Logging redwoods is a singularly divisive issue along California's
coast. Dawson's work has been praised as groundbreaking and
criticized for romanticizing redwoods at the expense of less notable
trees.</TE>
<TE>   Some coastal residents are using fog-drip research in lawsuits
intended to block redwood cutting, arguing that the tree condensation
feeds their underground water supply.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on redwoods fits the agenda of environmental groups
like San Francisco-based Save-the-Redwoods League, critics say.
Indeed, Dawson sits on the league's Board of Councillors, and the
league is funding research by both Sillett and Dawson.</TE>
<TE>   The fog drip "happens with any tree that reaches up into the fog,"
said Charles Jourdain, vice president of the California Redwood Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had no fog at all, you'd still have redwoods," said Susan
Davis, a park ranger with Redwood National and State Parks. She noted
that Humboldt Redwoods State Park is inland from the coastal fog but
is home to the world's tallest tree -- the Stratosphere Giant.</TE>
<TE>   That is the exception that proves the rule, Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest trees grow closest to the park's waterways, as do the
southernmost redwoods that depend less on fog than groundwater. Nor
do southern redwoods develop the soil mats found in the moister
conditions along the northern coast.</TE>
<TE>   But there seems little question that the trees hold the fog, Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The fog reached much farther inland along Northern California's
Redwood Creek Basin before the redwoods were intensively logged there
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she said. "Today, the fog lifts
very quickly. There's hardly any fog there at all."</TE>

<HD>Saws Fall Silent as Fort Bragg Faces Loss of Its Lumber
Mill</HD>
<DH>Culture: Impending closure will transform life in small
coastal town, which derived its identity from Georgia-Pacific.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN PRITCHARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT BRAGG, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Sprawling between Main Street and wind-raked ocean bluffs, the
Georgia-Pacific lumber mill has been far more than this town's
economic center. For generations, it has been part of the culture,
the swagger, the identity of blue-collar Fort Bragg.</LD>
<LD>   Before it started bleeding workers, the mill turned redwood trunks
into stacks of lumber so dependably that kids could graduate high
school on Friday and begin work on Monday, earning better pay than
any job around.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's closing. The timber industry blames government meddling
and environmental lawsuits. Environmentalists blame poor timber
management and market forces.</LD>
<TE>   A long, solitary whistle sounded as the last log went to mill. The
piercing shift-change whistles used to be so clockwork, people all
over town used them to tell time. Now fewer than 100 workers remain,
most just a few years from retirement, to close down the mill.</TE>
<TE>   "I call us the dinosaurs," said Michael Floyd, a mill worker since
graduating Fort Bragg High School, class of '62. "We're going to be
extinct."</TE>
<TE>   Founded by lumber baron Charles Russell Johnson in 1885, the mill
once employed 2,000. Old-timers said that if men in Fort Bragg didn't
have a job, there was something wrong with them.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific Corp. took over in 1972. The mill has had one
profitable year since 1994, according to company officials, who blame
tightened regulations, a dwindling supply of large trees, depressed
prices and the emergence of synthetic alternatives to redwood.</TE>
<TE>   "There was absolutely nothing we could do about it," said Ron
Holden, plant manager for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Time was, a mill seemed to straddle every river drainage on
California's North Coast. Now, just 10 mills statewide process
redwood, according to the industry-sponsored California Forestry
Assn. Five closed in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the numbers have fluctuated, mill jobs fell from 22,000
statewide in 1988 to 13,400 in 2001, according to state employment
data.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific is offering severance packages and training
sessions with the county employment agency. But ripple effects are
already evident in the town of 7,028, and worse trouble is coming.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of 125 good jobs -- a $6-million payroll -- will take
about $32 million out of the fragile local economy, by the
calculations of Fort Bragg banker Tom Becker.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific has been the town's anchor -- high schoolers play
for the Fort Bragg Timberwolves in a stadium renovated by
Georgia-Pacific; picnic tables at the local airport appear "courtesy
of Georgia-Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   Now garages won't service as many trucks, the grocery store will
sell less food. The county, city and schools will lose about $380,000
in tax revenue. Fewer patients with health insurance will support the
hospital. Bankers will have to defer loan payments from mill workers
on the ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Logger Mike Anderson, whose firm harvests timber for mills along
the North Coast, will lose an indispensable customer. "Their checks
never bounced," he said. "They were always on time."</TE>
<TE>   As the town looks for a substitute industry, tourism seems the
go-to option. Downtown, the refurbished Union Lumber Company Store
houses boutiques and eateries. The best-known attraction is the Skunk
Train, a ride into the redwood hills behind town.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, there are few shuttered shop fronts, and locals say
hotel occupancy is up as tourists search for beds more affordable
than the bed-and-breakfasts in cliff-side towns nearby.</TE>
<TE>   But while the shift to tourism may keep up local tax revenue, it's
a raw deal for workers -- it takes about three times as many hours
for a busboy's salary to equal what a mill worker took home.
Meanwhile, wealthy retirees and transplants from places such as San
Francisco, about a four-hour drive south, drive up the cost of
living.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the sad thing," said Robert Pinoli, Chamber of
Commerce president. "People who grew up in this area can't afford to
stay."</TE>
<TE>   Above the stack jutting from the mill's wood-fired power plant,
perhaps the most obvious town landmark, a plume of steam still
mingles with the fog that wisps over Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-September, the stack will stop spewing and, by November,
the mill will be dark. Already, the vast yards where lumber was
stacked appear barren.</TE>
<TE>   There's no lack of ideas with what should occupy the mill's 460
oceanfront acres: golf course, botanical garden, university, mall,
desalination plant, abalone farm.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the decision, there's work to be done before
Georgia-Pacific sells a property worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. Dismantling the last structures and cleaning the site may
take years.</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders suggest that Georgia-Pacific had planned to sell the
mill as early as 1999, when it sold off 194,000 acres of timberlands.
Company officials deny any such plan.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Georgia-Pacific decided to split the nation's
second-largest forest products company into distinct halves: a
building materials supply company, and a consumer and commercial
paper and plastics giant. The firm's sales more than doubled during
the 1990s and hit $25.1 billion in 2001, but over the past year, the
stock price has fallen by nearly half.</TE>
<TE>   Mill worker Kenny Alfaro, 59, calls it plain mismanagement. "You
can show me all the books you want, but I know better," he said,
pointing out that the last North Coast redwood mills are profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific officials insist that the inevitable has arrived.
"I don't know what those other companies' stories are," spokesman
Greg Guest said. "But our story is that we have been unable to be
profitable there."</TE>

<HD>2 Tales of Life on the Streets of Des Moines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT E. PIERRE</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>Born in Minneapolis, Gretchen Kogold, 20, moved to Des Moines with
her father when her parents separated. But she left because he beat
her, she said.</LD>
<LD>   While on her own, she was seriously hurt when a car hit her.
Later, she became pregnant. Her 18-month-old son now lives with her
mother in Minneapolis, and she sees him about twice a month. She is
more stable now, but small things remind her of how her life is
better.</LD>
<LD>   "You got your own keys," she said. "Room keys, a mailbox key. It
feels good."</LD>
<TE>   While she left home out of necessity, Kogold said many kids leave
home because they don't want to follow the rules. "I have a friend
who is 14," she said. "She chooses not to go home. She just doesn't
want the rules. She's content sleeping in a camp. It's an old boxcar
where at least five or six other people live."</TE>
<TE>   Braden Adair, 20, has lived on the streets before too. A native of
Des Moines, he left home at 16 because he said his stepfather was
mentally and physically abusive. Adair said he once drove to Virginia
in a friend's car and slept on the streets as a last resort when he
couldn't find a friend to share living space.</TE>
<TE>   Now Adair lives in his own place that his grandmother helped him
get. He has a steady job and makes $9.50 an hour, and he's trying to
get custody of his year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got life insurance, health insurance and rental insurance,"
he said, wearing baggy shorts and a Starter jersey, clutching a cell
phone. "I've got so much and it costs me so little.... I knew I
didn't want to stay on the streets and with family and friends."</TE>
<TE>   Kogold and Adair still stop by on Thursday afternoons at the
"drop-in center" across from Des Moines' downtown Marriott, where
homeless children, some with their parents, gather each week for a
free meal. Adair watched as families with small children and
adolescents lined up for spaghetti and meatballs, and the children
screamed and played as late afternoon turned into night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been coming down here since I was 13," he said. "If you need
information, they'll help you. If you need a ride, they will give you
one or come pick you up if it's important."</TE>

<HD>A Great Divide Over the Use of Cardiac Donors</HD>
<DH>Health: Almost half of the nation's 59 organ banks have
never handled a case because of ethical, medical and technical
questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA MECKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Christine Frank knew one thing for certain on that horrible day when
she was told that neither of her teenage sons would survive a car
accident.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'Listen to me now. They are to be organ donors. That was
their wish,' " said Frank, who lost James, 18, and Christopher, 15,
in 1998. "When you're hit with tragedy, if you're any kind of
survivor, you're going to find something to hold on to, to find it
made sense."</LD>
<LD>   Donating James' organs was routine. But in most parts of the
country, it would have been unlikely -- maybe impossible -- to offer
Christopher's organs.</LD>
<TE>   Christopher died when his heart stopped beating. James, like most
organ donors, died when his brain stopped functioning, allowing a
ventilator to keep his heart working until his organs were removed.</TE>
<TE>   It is a subtle difference that has vast implications when more
than 80,000 people are awaiting transplants and more than 6,000
people die each year while waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, there is a remarkable divide over using
organs from people who, like Christopher, die a cardiac death,
according to an Associated Press analysis of 2000 and 2001 data. A
few of the nation's 59 organ banks are aggressively using these
donors. But nearly half have never handled a case; more than a dozen
others have handled only one or two.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than half of the 168 cardiac donors nationwide
were handled by six organ banks.</TE>
<TE>   No regional pattern can explain the national disparity. In
Florida, two banks handle almost no cardiac donors. The state's other
three are among the most aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, experts estimate that there could be at least 1,000
cardiac donors each year, with each donor providing two to three
organs. These donors could provide enough kidneys and livers to
reduce by half the number who die waiting for the organs.</TE>
<TE>   In Philadelphia, where the local organ bank handles more cardiac
donors than any other, there have been 151 since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a total of 303 organs that would have been buried if we
didn't have this procedure," said Howard Nathan, executive director
of Gift of Life Donor Program.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the pursuit of cardiac donors has raised ethical, medical
and technical questions, partly because the organs must be harvested
almost immediately after the heart stops beating to prevent
deterioration. Among them: How long after a heart stops beating
before someone is dead? Are these organs good enough to transplant?
Will the process make doctors and nurses nervous?</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Medicine, which advises the government on medical
issues, had hoped to put those questions to rest. In 1997 and again
in 1999, the institute concluded that using these donors is
"important, medically effective and ethically acceptable." But there
is a lingering sense of discomfort in many parts of the country, even
a lack of interest. Often it is hard for doctors and nurses, who are
sometimes uncomfortable with removing life support to begin with,
said Dr. Christine Cassell, dean of the Oregon Health &amp; Sciences
University medical school and head of the institute's 1999 committee.</TE>
<TE>   For cardiac donation to work, a family must consent before the
person is declared dead. Then the medical team must watch the patient
die. "That's a hard thing psychologically for doctors and nurses to
do," Cassell said.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been concerns about the quality of the organs,
although recent studies suggest that they work just as well as
others. And the logistics are complicated, meaning that hospitals
must approve protocols and offer special training.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to increase the numbers, the United Network for Organ
Sharing convened focus groups this year. Most of the more than 200
doctors and nurses who participated knew nothing about cardiac
donation, although many said they would support it.</TE>
<TE>   Organ banks in New York, Cleveland, Houston, Denver and elsewhere
are beginning to take these donors, and others say they are exploring
the idea. Some banks have not given it much thought.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Frank of Cincinnati had talked about organ donation with
her sons not six months before they died and knew that is what they
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Retrieving organs from James was relatively straightforward. A
ventilator kept his heart pumping and lungs moving while doctors
conducted tests that showed he had no brain function, meaning he was
brain-dead. To preserve James' organs, the ventilator stayed on until
surgeons could begin harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   A ventilator was also keeping Christopher's heart pumping. But he
had minimal brain function. When a CT scan showed that his brain stem
was critically injured, indicating no chance for survival, his
parents told doctors to end life support.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors turned off the machine, waited for his heart to stop
beating, then waited five more minutes to be sure that it would not
start again. At that point, Christopher was officially dead, and
doctors could begin harvesting his kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases of cardiac death, the liver can also be retrieved,
although Christopher's was not usable. Thinking of the two women who
received kidneys from Christopher, Christine Frank is baffled that
cardiac donation is so rare. "I don't understand why it's not being
done everywhere," she said.</TE>

<HD>Ireland Is Reduced to Its Last Seminary</HD>
<DH>Religion: The declining observance of Catholicism and
growing anger over the sex abuse scandal are blamed for the closures
of the training schools for priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN POGATCHNIK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, whose network of theological
schools once exported priests worldwide, closed another hallowed
institution last week, leaving just a single seminary in this
predominantly Catholic country.</LD>
<LD>   The directors of St. Patrick's College in Thurles, County
Tipperary in southwest Ireland, said their few remaining seminarians
would transfer to the church's flagship seminary, Maynooth College
near Dublin, which is struggling to produce enough priests for the
next generation of Irish Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   The closing of St. Patrick's, along with that of other seminaries,
is indicative of a declining observance of the Catholic faith in
Ireland and growing public anger at church authorities' mishandling
of decades of sexual abuse within the church.</LD>
<TE>   "The decision to suspend seminary work in St. Patrick's College
will, understandably, cause disappointment to past students and
friends of the college. However, circumstances rendered unavoidable
the present painful decision," said the institution's president,
Father Christy O'Dwyer.</TE>
<TE>   He said school officials would "pray for the day when increasing
numbers of vocations to the priesthood may render it possible again
for St. Patrick's College to resume its ministry of priestly
formation."</TE>
<TE>   The college will continue to offer theology classes to lay
members.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, public confidence in the Catholic Church in Ireland
has steadily eroded as hundreds of cases have been exposed involving
church officials' sexual abuse of children dating back to the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The government in January established a compensation fund,
expected to pay out more than $500 million to victims of physical and
sexual abuse at church-run schools and orphanages. That deal doesn't
cover parish priests, more than 20 of whom have been convicted of
criminal counts of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The government and Catholic bishops this summer launched
investigations into the extent that church leaders concealed abuse
from civil authorities until the 1990s. The scandal has hit Maynooth,
where trustees in June appointed a senior lawyer to investigate
allegations that seminarians were abused in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   St. Patrick's, founded in 1837, used to train diocesan priests for
service throughout the world, including parishes in the United States
and Australia. Among its more than 1,500 graduates, about 180 still
serve in U.S. parishes.</TE>
<TE>   The Thurles seminary was the seventh to close in the Republic of
Ireland since 1993, leaving only Maynooth, the first Irish seminary,
founded in 1795. This summer, Maynooth enrolled 15 seminarians. A
handful of others entered the Irish College in Rome and a Belfast
seminary, St. Malachy's, in neighboring Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Father Kevin Doran, who is in charge of recruiting seminarians in
Ireland, found out Thursday that Thurles was being closed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised. It feels like when a relative, who has been sick
for a long time, finally dies," Doran said. "It is very sad. All
these seminaries meant so much to so many people who passed through
them."</TE>
<TE>   Catholicism and Irish nationalism were once closely linked. Until
the 1960s, ambitious families sent their sons into seminaries in
hopes of escaping an Ireland that produced few high-status jobs and
many emigres.</TE>
<TE>   But since the 1960s, as Ireland increasingly opened its doors to
foreign investment and cultural influences, the church's standing has
declined.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, weekly Mass attendance was more than 90%. Recent polls
put it at less than 50%.</TE>

<HD>Bulldozer Rams the Wrong House</HD>

<DL>HOLLYWOOD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A Florida couple's dinner was interrupted when a bulldozer tore down
part of the roof of their house as they sat inside.</LD>
<LD>   The bulldozer was set to demolish several homes in the area but it
rammed into the wrong house, police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Suarez and Yesenia Reyes were having dinner Thursday
evening when the bulldozer came in through the back of their house,
police spokesman Tony Rode said. It hit the rental home a second time
before screaming neighbors and the couple prompted the driver to
stop.</LD>
<TE>   "I started yelling at him, 'What the hell are you guys doing?' "
Reyes told the Sun-Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby homes in the neighborhood 20 miles north of Miami were
slated to be demolished as part of a renewal project, but the
couple's rental home was not on the list.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you say? ... They hit the wrong house," Rode said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Fire Rescue officials estimated the damage at between
$5,000 and $10,000. George Zaragozi General Contractors of Miami
promised to repair the roof immediately, local media said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can fix it in two days," said Zaragozi, the president. "[The
driver] made a mistake and thought it was supposed to be demolished."</TE>

<HD>Drugs, Guns, Gangs Mark Life in Little Rock</HD>
<DH>Crime: Surge of violence in Arkansas capital began in the
late 1980s and hasn't stopped. Police admit that they can only
contain it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN SKOLOFF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.</DL>
<LD>Like a mob hit, a pack of youths open fire with semiautomatic rifles
on a passing car. A 3-year-old girl takes a bullet intended for her
father, a suspected gang member. The bullet misses her brain, and she
barely survives.</LD>
<LD>   Mail service is suspended in a neighborhood after a bullet pierces
a delivery truck. Two men are shot dead sitting in their car behind
an abandoned house in an apparent drug deal gone bad. Nearby, a
24-year-old man is found dead on the sidewalk outside a beauty salon,
shot in an apparent revenge killing.</LD>
<LD>   A portion of the last six months on the streets of Little Rock:
Drugs, guns and gangs.</LD>
<TE>   "Daddy," as he's known on the streets, sits in a car at 14th and
Booker talking about his grip on this neighborhood. Young, armed
sentinels patrol nearby, watching for police and rival gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "Man in the hole!" someone yells. Daddy slouches low in his seat,
tips the brim of his baseball cap beneath his eyes and cocks his head
slightly to the left as a police patrol car slowly passes.</TE>
<TE>   "They got nothin' on me," he says. "Yeah, I've shot several
people. That's just life on the streets. That's why I get respect....
Now, I help keep these kids from killing each other, establish order.
Some of the killings before were useless."</TE>
<TE>   It has been 10 years since the FBI ranked the per capita homicide
rate of Little Rock ahead of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. In
1993, the city hit a record high of 76 murders. HBO highlighted the
capital's plight with a documentary titled: "Gang War: Bangin' in
Little Rock."</TE>
<TE>   Before the show aired in 1994, few spoke publicly about the surge
of gang violence that began in the late 1980s. The documentary
revealed the skeletons in the city's closet, and Mayor Jim Dailey
says business leaders were frantic.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not just killing the people on the streets, you're killing
our economy," Dailey said he was told.</TE>
<TE>   Gangs carved out territory in 10-block chunks. Gunshots rang in
the night. Law enforcement task forces were formed, a youth curfew
was enacted, neighborhood associations cropped up by the dozens,
church groups mobilized and the Legislature passed strict
sentence-enhancing bills.</TE>
<TE>   Violence slowed considerably, and residents in gang-riddled
neighborhoods no longer had to sleep in cast-iron bathtubs for
protection from stray bullets.</TE>
<TE>   But after serving fractions of their 10-and 20-year sentences,
gang leaders are hitting the streets again. Recruiting is on the
rise; police say there are 27 active gangs in Little Rock. Some
officials say the best police can do is confine the violence, not
stamp it out.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Det. Todd Hurd, the police department's
lead gang intelligence officer, and an undercover narcotics agent sit
in an old Ford Explorer backed up to an abandoned house behind some
bushes. Their eyes are glued on the opposite street corner where
several youths sell crack.</TE>
<TE>   Conversation shifts to a double killing that happened a week ago
in the alley just behind this house.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how comfortable I feel sitting here," the undercover
officer says to Hurd. "Knowing what those guys were killed with" --
high-powered assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   They choose to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   Both officers wear pistols on their hips. The backs of their seats
are draped with bulletproof vests. Black, short-barreled shotguns are
nestled in their armpits, the tips resting on the floorboard.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, Little Rock didn't have a gang problem. But as
violence surged in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, gangs spread
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Mothers in L.A. and Chicago decided that their kids had been
beaten up or shot at too many times, so they put them on a bus and
sent them to backwoods Little Rock," Hurd said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Richardson, a coordinator with New Futures for Youth, a city
program designed to offer at-risk kids opportunities outside of gang
life, said the city has made progress keeping kids out of gangs, but
that the work will never be done.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell the kids, 'You may not make $100 in 20 minutes, but rest
assured, you don't have to worry about someone shooting you on the
job making hamburgers,' " Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hurd is on the front line battling gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's all about making money. It's all about dealing
dope," Hurd said. "They look at the police like speed bumps. We're
just out there trying to slow them down."</TE>
<TE>   To do that, several times a year, the police stage "reversals,"
replacing street-corner drug dealers with undercover cops.</TE>
<TE>   "This strikes at the heart of what moves the gangs. The drug money
is the motivating factor, the whole scheme," Hurd said. "And it keeps
the streets clean for a few days."</TE>
<TE>   But the problems of poverty and desperation are still there.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these kids have a real concern about their own families.
They do illegal things to help put food on the table," said Dorothy
Nayles, of the city's Department of Community Programs. "More times
than we'd like to see, you have kids involved in the wrong things for
the right reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Leifel Jackson knows the drill. In the late 1980s and early '90s,
he said he made as much as $4,000 a day selling crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared in the HBO documentary. A short time later, he
was arrested and served nearly nine years in prison for drug
trafficking. He now has several jobs, including one as an
administrator for an at-risk youth program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough going from a drug dealer to having to work for a
living," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson says he justified his illegal activities with good deeds,
like buying shoes for neighborhood kids and firecrackers for the
community on Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   "And when night came, the same kids I would buy shoes for, I would
turn around and sell their parents crack," he said. "In a twisted
way, I was helping kill the people I loved in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Daddy, 48, is one of the city's oldest gang members. He got out of
prison two years ago; a chunk of his leg is missing from an AK-47
round, and his eyes are bloodshot and yellow from years of crack use.</TE>
<TE>   He says he doesn't find today's gangs as violent as those from the
1990s. He takes credit for that.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them, 'If you get into it with somebody ... you don't ride
up and smoke everybody out there. You just get that one. You might
have to hit a couple to get him, but he's got to go and really it
save lives," he said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Daddy says imparting such knowledge is rewarding. Police say their
rewards are locking up people like Daddy.</TE>

<HD>Homeless Youths' Plight Is Perilous, Even in the Midwest</HD>
<DH>Society: Study of runaways in eight Heartland cities shows
that most ran away to escape abuse, only to be assaulted on the
streets.</DH>

<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>Shane Stewart trolls underpasses, bridges and back alleys for signs
of life. A stashed backpack. Boards slightly ajar on an abandoned
building. Discarded candy wrappers or soda cans. Signs that might
lead him to a homeless child.</LD>
<LD>   "It's amazing how many kids are out there," Stewart, a youth
outreach worker, said as he rode alongside dusty railroad tracks on
the edges of downtown. "When you think of Des Moines, you don't think
of kids in the street. But they're there."</LD>
<LD>   A couple of years ago, he crossed paths with Gretchen Kogold, who
slept on friends' couches, sometimes on the streets or in a parked
car after leaving her father's home at age 16 because she could no
longer stand the beatings.</LD>
<TE>   "For me, it was either leave or end up dead," said Kogold, now 20,
who lives at the local YWCA. "That's how bad it had gotten."</TE>
<TE>   Homelessness in cities such as Des Moines is not as conspicuous as
in New York, Washington or Chicago, where it's not uncommon to see
bodies curled up on steam grates and huddled masses gathered in
public parks to await their daily soup-kitchen rations.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the city, living on the streets is just as perilous,
particularly for young people, according to initial findings of a
$3-million study to determine where homeless youths come from, why
they're on the streets and what happens as they grow into adults.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with 455 homeless youths in eight Midwestern cities,
including Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, most said they left home
to escape abuse only to be beaten, sexually assaulted and robbed on
the streets. Many traded sex to survive, disturbing behavior that
researchers fear could have lasting effects as they grow into adults.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting phenomenal rates of mental disorder, conduct
problems, substance abuse, depression and post-traumatic stress
disorder," said Les Whitbeck, the sociology professor at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln who is leading the study. "This is a
group of overlooked kids that is hard to treat and hard to engage."</TE>
<TE>   Results from the first year of his study show that 54% of male
runaways and 34% of females have conduct disorder, compared to about
10% of the general teenage population. Also, 23% of males and 43% of
females showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Although many studies have interviewed the homeless, few have
tracked them over time, Whitbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   The plights of the homeless and runaways are among the agenda
items at this month's White House conference at George Washington
University on missing, exploited and runaway children. Child
advocates say the national numbers should startle everyone.</TE>
<TE>   One in seven children will run away by age 18, according to a
federal survey. Each day, 1.3 million runaway and homeless youths
live on America's streets. Five thousand die each year from assault,
illness and suicide. Technically runaways, many are more often
referred to by advocates and outreach workers as "throwaways" because
they were forced out of their homes and, in far too many cases, no
one is anticipating their return.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the street, many youths quickly feel the terror of being
alone. Adult shelters and feeding programs are frequented by
sometimes menacing characters. At the National Runaway Switchboard,
based in Chicago, experts say most youths who call have been on the
street less than three days.</TE>
<TE>   "They get out on the streets and they get scared," said executive
director Maureen Blaha, whose group gets as many as 400 calls each
day. "These are very vulnerable youth who become victims. And to
survive, they are often perpetrators of crime. They steal to survive
or turn to prostitution to get a warm shower. But they're still
kids." Kids, she said, who made a choice that anything was better
than the life they had at home.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids that are running are running from something," Blaha
said. "It's not this Tom Sawyer / Huck Finn adventure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caring is rare when it comes to public officials and policies
aimed at the homeless, said R. Dean Wright, a professor at Drake
University, who has studied and written extensively about the
homeless. Throughout the country, he said, locales are essentially
"criminalizing" being without a home by making it illegal to sleep in
a public park or hang around in public places downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a culture that has encouraged the visibility of
homelessness," Wright said. "We've got a lot of denial because we
have people who argue that a person living in a shelter is not
homeless because they have a roof over their head. The philosophy is
ignore them and they will go away."</TE>
<TE>   Surely some people have that attitude, but public officials are
trying to address the problem, said Lyle Schwery, Des Moines'
homeless assistance coordinator for the last decade. He administers
about $2 million in state and federal grants the city gets to assist
private groups with the problem.</TE>
<TE>   During the last city census of the homeless in January, Schwery
said some 3,700 homeless people were counted, about half of them
children either alone or accompanied by parents. It's among these two
groups that the bed shortage is most severe.</TE>
<TE>   "There is never enough money," he said. "We probably have $50 to
$60 worth of requests for every dollar we have to allocate."</TE>
<TE>   Although more money is needed, it is not the only solution,
Schwery said, noting that no community is immune from the issues that
lead to homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "Des Moines may appear to be different," he said. "We have this
wholesome down-home persona, and it is a wholesome, friendly place.
But we are not exempt from the problems that cause homelessness. We
have substance abuse. We have domestic violence. We have a shortage
of affordable housing.... You can't look at homelessness like a
monolith. Every homeless person has their own story, their own little
barriers they have to overcome to get back to a stable home."</TE>

<HD>IPOs Net $11 Million for WorldCom Ex-CEO</HD>
<DH>Business: House panel probes whether the firm got special
treatment from Salomon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SHERMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former WorldCom Inc. chief executive Bernard Ebbers amassed more than
$11 million on shares of initial public offerings made available to
him by an investment banking house, documents obtained by a
congressional committee showed.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee is investigating whether
Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's investment banking division,
allowed executives at WorldCom to buy shares of new technology stocks
as an inducement for banking business.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is also looking into whether WorldCom executives
were allowed to pay the offering price even after the price had
already soared.</LD>
<TE>   Complying with a subpoena issued Friday, Jane Sherburne,
Citigroup's deputy general counsel, denied that IPOs were offered as
a lure for business and said trades sometimes are recorded in a
customer's account at the offering price a day or two after the
initial offering "for a host of benign reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' biggest winner was the 100,000 shares of Metromedia Fiber
Network of New York that he received in October 1997 and sold on
various dates the following year for a gain of nearly $4.6 million,
according to Salomon Smith Barney documents that the House panel
posted on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) said the documents raise questions
about the fairness of IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   "The market should reward investors for taking calculated risk,"
Oxley said in a statement. "This is an example of how insiders were
able to game the system at the expense of the average investor."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup responded to an earlier subpoena Monday with an
acknowledgment that it provided its best customers, WorldCom
executives among them, with access to IPOs. Ebbers, for example,
received 869,000 shares between 1996 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said it would not provide further details without
another subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's former chief financial officer, Scott Sullivan, who was
indicted Wednesday on federal securities fraud charges, was allocated
22,300 shares between 1996 and March. He sold his shares at an
overall loss of $13,000, records show.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which owns MCI, the nation's second-largest
long-distance company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy July 21 after
disclosing that it had overstated profits by $3.8 billion. It was the
biggest such filing in U.S. history. Since then, the company has
disclosed an additional $3.3 billion in inflated profits.</TE>

<HD>Freedom's Struggle a Family Affair</HD>
<DH>Myanmar: Aung San was assassinated in 1947 when his
daughter was only 2. Now, Aung San Suu Kyi leads the country's
democracy movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRANT PECK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>YANGON, Myanmar</DL>
<LD>When modern Myanmar's founding father was cut down by assassins'
bullets in 1947, his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, was just 2 years
old.</LD>
<LD>   For decades after Gen. Aung San's death, a succession of weak,
incompetent or despotic leaders ruled the country. His legacy seemed
consigned to the history books and his dusty home-turned-museum.</LD>
<LD>   The date of his death, July 19, was observed each year as Martyrs'
Day, but the annual ritual seemed only a reminder of the doleful
history of the country, formerly known as Burma.</LD>
<TE>   No more, thanks to Suu Kyi -- the daughter who has become the
undisputed leader of the country's democracy movement, a woman who
meets with Myanmar's military masters on equal terms and stakes a
claim to her father's heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you see his presence in the thought and expressions of
Aung San Suu Kyi," says Josef Silverstein, a retired Myanmar
specialist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. "I think that the
people still see her as carrying out his ideas about a peaceful and
united Burma."</TE>
<TE>   For this year's commemoration, Suu Kyi's opposition party urged a
dialogue with the government to solve the nation's woes, saying the
talks should be in line with "policies laid down by the martyrs" -- a
reference to Aung San and his fellow independence fighters who had
visions of creating a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Aung San, one of Asia's great anti-colonial leaders, was a blunt
man of action. His Oxford-educated daughter is refined, worldly and
patient. But they share charisma, fierce nationalism and a stubborn
streak. Rebellion also runs in the family: Some 19th century
ancestors actively resisted British colonization.</TE>
<TE>   "Even at a young age, Aung San was very much anti-British, in a
xenophobic sort of way, because his maternal grandfather had been
beheaded by the British," says Sein Win, 80, who as a young reporter
covered Aung San's brief career.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1915, Aung San became head of the country's largest
nationalist association, and he enlisted Japan's aid to build up the
Burma Independence Army to kick out the British.</TE>
<TE>   When the Japanese took over the country during World War II, they
installed a puppet nationalist government that included Aung San. But
he led an underground struggle against Japan, and his nationalist
army switched its allegiance in March 1945 to the Allied cause.</TE>
<TE>   Aung San then negotiated an independence accord with Britain, and
in April 1947 his party won 196 of 202 seats in an election for a
constitutional assembly.</TE>
<TE>   But six months before independence, gunmen burst into a meeting of
the interim government, killing Aung San and six Cabinet ministers. A
rival, former Prime Minister U Saw, was tried and hanged for
arranging the assassination.</TE>
<TE>   His life cut short at age 32, "he died as a freedom fighter, as a
hero, but not as a real political leader," says Sein Win.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, one of Aung San's comrades in the independence struggle,
Ne Win, staged a coup d'etat, installing a socialist police state
that led the nation to economic ruin. His misrule sparked a popular
uprising in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   By chance, Suu Kyi had returned home that April to nurse her dying
mother. She had lived abroad since she was 15, earning a degree at
Oxford University, working at the United Nations and, in 1972,
marrying an English academic, Michael Aris.</TE>
<TE>   Although a political unknown, the Aung San component of her name
was enough to bring out half a million people for her speech at the
foot of Yangon's Shwedagon Pagoda on Aug. 26, 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all
that was going on," she declared.</TE>
<TE>   Defying a brutal military crackdown, she helped found a party, the
National League for Democracy. The day after an abortive protest on
Martyrs' Day in 1989, Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest and spent
the next six years in isolation at her home in Yangon.</TE>
<TE>   Her party won the 1990 general election while she was under house
arrest, taking 392 of 495 parliamentary seats, but the military
wouldn't let it take power. In 1991, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   She was released from house arrest in 1995, but the military
continued to harass her and restrict her movements. She spent an
additional 19 months under house arrest until her release May 6.</TE>
<TE>   But the generals haven't been able to stop her from pressing the
democracy campaign. On Aug. 7, a videotape was released in Thailand
in which she calls on the international community to pressure
Myanmar's regime to free all its political prisoners.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAINT-DENIS, France</DL>
<LD>The river of humanity began at the basilica's stone entrance,
stretched past its stained glass windows and spilled toward the
ticket booth for the tombs of French kings.</LD>
<LD>   Other lines heaved on the streets outside. Parents, children,
burly men, all waiting in hopes of one thing: getting papers to live
and work legally in France.</LD>
<LD>   A dramatic two-week occupation of a famous church by hundreds of
illegal immigrants has forced France to re-examine one of its most
divisive problems: how to balance immigration with fears that the
country is being overrun.</LD>
<TE>   The immigrants are known in France as sans-papiers, meaning "those
without documents." Many have lived illegally in France for years,
hiding from police, surviving on charity, working for little pay. The
protest at the basilica of Saint-Denis drew them out into the open.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by media coverage and the mistaken belief that they
would get papers simply by registering with protest organizers, the
number of sans-papiers at the church snowballed. Organizers said they
had taken the names of 1,000 people from 23 countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The French can say it's their country and that they can reject
who they want, but in that case they should not say that theirs is a
country of law," said Nura Haouadeg, who came from Algeria three
years ago with her husband. Their tourist visas expired long ago and
officials refused them asylum.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in fear -- fear of the police, the gendarmes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The extremist National Republican Movement said protesters should
be sent home. But France has found it hard, and politically risky, to
do so. Many come from former French colonies plagued by poverty,
rights abuses and, in Algeria's case, Islamic insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, the protesters appeared to have worn out their welcome.
Saint-Denis' bishop said they should leave. Organizers said the
occupation, which began Aug. 17, would end this weekend or soon
after. "It will finish here, but the struggle won't stop," one said.</TE>

<HD>Man Alters Course After 2nd Brush With Death</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Survivor of World Trade Center attack, who also
lived through the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, takes step toward
simpler life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HILL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ESSEX, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Bruce Stephan dodged death during the 1989 San Francisco earthquake
when part of the Bay Bridge collapsed beneath his car.</LD>
<LD>   He resolved to change his life. Instead, he stayed on a frenetic
career track that led to New York City -- and the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   There, on Sept. 11, Stephan was working in one tower and his wife
in the other when the hijacked planes struck.</LD>
<TE>   He escaped death again that day, as did his wife. This time, at
46, Stephan is trying to make the most of his second chance, the
second time around.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce and Joan Stephan left Manhattan last fall for a
one-stoplight Upstate New York hamlet a hefty drive from the nearest
Starbucks. Nights once dominated by work are taken up by reading
clubs and a local theater production. Stephan is determined, in his
own small way, to make the world a better place.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this is just dumb luck, in a way," he said.
"There's some message, some purpose.... You do start to feel that
this can't happen twice unless there's something."</TE>
<TE>   The Stephans lived in San Francisco in 1989 as they worked their
way through law school. Bruce Stephan was driving across the upper
deck of the Bay Bridge with a co-worker when the earthquake hit. The
bridge's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck, taking Stephan's
Mazda with it.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I remember is screaming, 'We're gonna die!' then
blacking out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He came to with his car wedged perilously in a yawning gap in a
section of the bridge, hundreds of feet above the water. He climbed
out the window and helped pull his co-worker out.</TE>
<TE>   His back was hurt, but he was alive. And his wife, who had been
working in an office, was unhurt. The couple moved from city to city
through the 1990s, eventually settling back in their hometown, New
York City. They commuted downtown together to the World Trade Center.
Stephan did consulting work for the Port Authority in the north
tower. His wife did contract work in the south tower.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Stephan was booting up his laptop on the 65th floor
when he heard what sounded like a bomb. Then the building swayed.
Shattered glass and flaming debris rained outside the window. Stephan
told his co-workers to evacuate and started his slow descent down the
stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Only when he got to the bottom did he hear that planes had struck
each tower. A rescue worker broke the news before borrowing Stephan's
cell phone to call his own family. The worker couldn't get through.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me super intensely and he held his badge out to me
and he said, 'Look at my badge. Remember my name. If I don't make it
out of here alive, tell my family where I was, how I died.' And
that's when I said, 'Oh my God!' "</TE>
<TE>   Stephan tried to call his wife -- but couldn't get through.</TE>
<TE>   Although he hadn't attended Mass regularly for 20 years, he
wandered into a church where it was cool and peaceful. He knelt down
and promised to be a better person and to help people. He asked God
to help Joan if she was still alive.</TE>
<TE>   She was. A massive fireball had shot by her window when the first
plane struck the north tower. She recalls thinking: "Somebody got
sucked out, and it's not going to be me." And she left the south
tower as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue worker who told Stephan about the airliners also
survived.</TE>
<TE>   In the anxious weeks after the attack, the Stephans decided to get
away from Manhattan. They said they felt like they were living in the
middle of a big bull's-eye and they wanted a better life. And Stephan
knew that the change needed to be dramatic to avoid a repeat of the
fizzled resolution after the 1989 earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on TV all over the place [in 1989] saying this is my second
life and I'm going to change my life, and I'm going to do things
differently," he recalled. "And they interviewed me a year later ...
and it was really embarrassing because I hadn't."</TE>
<TE>   They settled on Essex, a Norman Rockwell-like town of about 700 on
Lake Champlain about an hour south of the Canadian border. They rent
a house so close to the lake that you can hear water lapping on the
shore from the wraparound porch. People wave on the street and toss
snowballs at your window in the winter to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   The couple still spend about a quarter of their work hours in
Manhattan -- 250 miles away -- but are able to work mostly from home.
They still work long hours, but now try to knock off at 6 p.m.
instead of late at night.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is changing his life step by small step. He tries to be
more community-minded. He goes to zoning meetings, historic
preservation meetings and church. He works with peace groups. Both he
and his wife have parts in the local production of "Harvey," the old
chestnut about a man whose best friend is a giant invisible rabbit.</TE>
<TE>   Stephan tells his survivor's tale to church groups and anyone else
who will listen. His talk includes a plea for understanding to avoid
a repeat of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be working to do better diplomacy, to change the way
the rest of the world looks at us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't sure what's next. He might write a book or teach. Fate
has gotten him this far, and he wants to see where it takes him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like when you sail. You feel the wind and if the
wind shifts, you change your course and go with it," he said. "I'm
just trying to take everything as fate."</TE>

<HD>Saudi Royals Take Lifestyle Vacation</HD>
<DH>Summer: Members of the House of Saud frolic at Spain's
casinos, discos and topless beaches. And they shop, spending about $5
million a day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEROME SOCOLOVSKY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MARBELLA, Spain</DL>
<LD>It's the hottest hour of the day at the Puente Romano beach club when
a girl of 13 dashes out of the hotel gardens, throwing a black cloak
over her flowing hair, T-shirt and jeans, and leaving the topless
sunbathers behind.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah al-Kabbani, child of Saudi royalty, is obeying the muezzin's
call to prayer, and she's running late.</LD>
<LD>   King Fahd, leader of one of the world's strictest Muslim nations,
has come to his vacation residence in Marbella, the Mediterranean
capital of sun and sin, bringing along thousands of members of the
House of Saud.</LD>
<TE>   As usual, Saudi princes and princesses are expected to snap up
Hermes scarves and Rolex watches by the display case, slap down
millions on roulette tables and boogie into the night with the
bejeweled blonds at the Olivia Valere discotheque.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lifestyle strictly prohibited in Saudi Arabia, the
birthplace of Islam, where boys and girls are forbidden to hold hands
in public and the constitution is based on Islam's holy book, the
Koran.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the gap between the monarchy's practices and
preaching is under greater scrutiny than usual. War talk rumbles
through the Middle East and Saudi Arabia wrestles with the fallout
from terrorism and the fact that 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were
Saudis -- devotees of Osama bin Laden and his campaign to topple a
monarchy he views as America's corrupt puppet.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi royalty has been part of the Marbella glitterati ever since
the 1970s' Arab oil boom. When Fahd built his summer residence atop
an artificial hill overlooking the city, the White House look-alike
mansion shocked a city whose gaudy architecture makes Beverly Hills
look staid.</TE>
<TE>   Called An-Nada, or the Dew, the palace got a face-lift in time for
Fahd's arrival Aug. 14 from Switzerland, where he has another
residence.</TE>
<TE>   Although princes vacation in the palace every summer, the House of
Saud has virtually transplanted itself here for the first visit in
three years by the 81-year-old sovereign, who handed over authority
to Crown Prince Abdullah after suffering a stroke in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Fahd, who now uses a wheelchair, hardly ever comes into town. But
he sends aides on shopping sprees or summons merchants to bring their
most exclusive offerings to the palace. The other day, Spain's King
Juan Carlos came for a visit. Shopkeepers have stocked up on luxury
items, expecting the royals to spend some $5 million a day during the
month or more that they stay here.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they come here, they turn this place on its head,"
said Antonio Mena, who sells $250 silk scarves in one of Puerto Banus
Marina's exclusive shops while moonlighting as a personal trainer for
Fahd's 27-year-old niece, Princess Hadza. His brother just got a
temporary job as the princess' chauffeur.</TE>
<TE>   Mena added that last year, the Saudis went to a Cartier jewelry
shop "and spent more than 60 million euros in a single day." A euro
is roughly a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   High-end merchants aren't the only ones cashing in.</TE>
<TE>   Under the eucalyptus trees by the palace's service gate, hundreds
of poor North Africans have been waiting for weeks to be temporarily
hired by Saudis at $3,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not beggars," said Minetou Sidi Ali, seated with half a
dozen other Mauritanian women in colorful scarves around a camping
stove.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll cook. We'll clean," she said. "We'll do anything as long as
it's dignified work."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi men seem to have more fun. The women wear veils and
waterproof robes, even on Marbella's topless beaches. A woman riding
a Jet Ski while covered head-to-toe in a black robe is not an
uncommon sight.</TE>
<TE>   But after Friday prayers were over at the Abdulaziz al-Saud
mosque, Sarah al-Kabbani tore off her garment and wove her way on
foot through a traffic jam of Mercedes sedans back to the Puente
Romano, where suites cost $1,270 a night.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty of ways kids can have good clean fun in Marbella,
such as hanging out or going to movies. But when Sarah started to
talk about them, a man in sunglasses appeared, scolded her in Arabic
for talking to a reporter and sent her away.</TE>
<TE>   He turned out to be a royal family member named Adnan al-Fadda.
Munching on a fresh date, he said Saudis behave no differently in
Marbella than at home. Then, after indignantly knocking down the
gossip in Marbella about Saudi men and blond escorts for hire, he
turned to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It had nothing to do with the political situation in Saudi Arabia,
he said. He refused to believe that any of the hijackers were Saudi
citizens and maintained the attacks were an Israeli-CIA plot.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how many Jews in the World Trade Center didn't go to
work that day?" he said, repeating a conspiracy theory rampant in the
Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a Puerto Banus cafe with his chauffeur, maid and
private English teacher, 10-year-old Saud bin Fahd al Hussein said he
believed that the Sept. 11 attacks were actually ordered by President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The tutor, Syrian-born Laura Khaled Niazi, didn't object to the
boy's theory.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids," she said. "They read these things on the Internet."</TE>

<HD>India Holy Man Is Seeking Communion at 13,500 Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GURINDER OSAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PINDARI, India</DL>
<LD>The goddess, they say, should not come to you easily. So the holy man
seeks her every year by trekking for three days high into the
Himalayas.</LD>
<LD>   He climbs to a hand-built hut 13,500 feet up, where oxygen fades
and nothing grows but a few wisps of grass.</LD>
<LD>   Here, in the deep Himalayan wilderness, Swami Dharamand -- mystic,
ascetic, mountaineer and man of deep curiosity -- seeks communion
with the Hindu goddess Devi Annapurna.</LD>
<TE>   Hindus have long seen the Himalayas as a place of purity and
ennoblement. Many trekkers also speak of the mountains' mystical
appeal -- the beauty, the isolation, the challenge. It's a place
where people of many faiths come seeking their gods.</TE>
<TE>   Dharamand, a 32-year-old Hindu holy man, has been wandering India
since leaving his far-off village 16 years ago. He left the world
behind: no sex, no shaving, long periods spent in meditation.</TE>
<TE>   From his hut, he sees a mountain named for his goddess and speaks
of it worshipfully: "In the moonlight, you cannot look at her for too
long. She is so beautiful, so beautiful, you will die."</TE>
<TE>   But all is not isolation. Dharamand, normally clad in just a thin
saffron robe and nearly always smiling, is profoundly curious about
the world he cast aside.</TE>
<TE>   When he comes down from the mountain every winter, when the cold
grows too intense and the snow too deep, he meets friends and
followers throughout India. And he talks. He loves to talk. He talks
about cameras and CD players, about mountaineering gear, about Bill
Gates.</TE>
<TE>   His hut is a combination of modern practicality and medieval
asceticism: The simple structure was assembled by hand but it holds
vacuum-sealed dinners given by trekkers, 13 varieties of South Indian
pickles and more. It's a hard three-day walk to the nearest
telephone, but he has one of the world's highest-altitude toilets.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, Dharamand shares.</TE>
<TE>   His life is a cycle of sharing: Donations of money flow through
his fingers and on to others. Gifts left by mountaineers later turn
up in villagers' huts. Help is returned in ways both material and
spiritual, whether it's leaving a Gortex jacket with a young villager
or giving guidance to a follower in one of India's sprawling cities.</TE>

<HD>Lean Back-to-School Inventories at Retailers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am not shedding tears for the major retailers ["Back-to-School
Sales Disappoint," Aug. 21].</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the key phrase in this story is "lean inventories." While
back-to-school shopping for my grandson, I was unable to locate a
decent selection of pants, shirts, shorts or socks in sizes 5, 5 slim
and 6. I walked away from Sears and Target and logged off Gap.com,
spending far less than I was prepared to part with, simply because
they were either sold out of his size or did not carry the size at
all.</LD>
<LD>   And this was mid-August, when one would expect to find shelves
fully stocked with back-to-school apparel.</LD>

<HD>The Behaviors of Unscrupulous Movers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Victims Find Unscrupulous Movers Take Them for a Ride" [Aug. 18]</LD>
<LD>   I have observed unscrupulous behavior by nationally known moving
companies, both personally and as an attorney, in connection with
seeking reimbursement to restore damaged goods.</LD>
<LD>   The movers' pattern and practice works like this: The mover sells
the consumer a "policy of damage insurance," which is actually not
insurance requiring the mover to observe the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, but instead is the mover's own unregulated
contract.</LD>
<TE>   After one's goods are damaged, and a claim made, the mover's
claims adjuster sends out a captive estimator/repair person who
severely low-balls the cost to repair mover-caused damage.</TE>
<TE>   The estimator often will try to find pre-existing damage where it
does not exist. The estimator, who is rarely, if ever, qualified to
restore valuable antiques and goods, will offer to restore the
damaged goods for his/her quoted estimate. The consumer must then
retain a qualified restorer, get competing estimates/bids, and
typically proceed to court (I've yet to hear of a mover that settled
a claim for even close to the qualified restorer's estimate) to
recover the actual restoration costs.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate moves favor movers, who rely upon the Carmack Amendment
to avoid tort damages, thus owing only breach-of-contract
(restoration and depreciation) damages.</TE>
<TE>   Intrastate moves are not as legally stacked against the consumer.
Nevertheless, for both interstate and intrastate moves, the consumer
best protects him/herself by obtaining homeowners insurance (or a
rider to an existing policy) providing coverage for any loss
occurring during the move, as their insurer has much greater
bargaining power with the low-balling mover.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Target Pulls Apparel on Neo-Nazi Allegation" [Aug. 29].</LD>
<LD>   By pulling out apparel with the "88" logo on it, Target is
yielding to our society's insane obsession with political
correctness.</LD>
<LD>   To the Chinese people, "88" symbolized great prosperity for
centuries before Hitler was born. Hitler also bastardized the
swastika, which symbolizes good luck or blessing. Since the swastika
has been in use at least since the Bronze Age in Europe and is still
much in vogue in Southeast Asia, should we coerce a worldwide ban on
its use also?</LD>
<TE>   As America is becoming a multiracial and multicultural society, it
will become increasingly impossible to design any symbol or logo
which would not offend a small group of people.</TE>
<TE>   Given our current economic outlook, I will take as many "88s" as I
can get.</TE>

<LD>So the government thinks the airlines need to be more fiscally
responsible before granting their applications for loan guarantees
["Tough Stance Toward Airlines," Aug. 22]?</LD>
<LD>   And the first target of Treasury Secretary O'Neill is United
Airlines' high labor costs? Where is the compassion? How much would
you need to be paid to work as an airline employee? Wouldn't you try
to work for the best-paying employer in your industry?</LD>
<LD>   Instead, why not start at the top and demand top management only
be compensated when profitable?</LD>
<TE>   After all, the mismanagement in the past led to current problems,
and lack of government security led to Sept. 11, which exacerbated
them. In the post-Enron business environment, it would seem prudent
to scrutinize those with the keys to the vault, not ask labor for
concessions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hurray for Steve Kisch ["Activists' Lawsuits Target Junk Faxes," Aug.
23]. I for one am sick and tired of having to hide my fax numbers. I
have changed my fax number twice, had it removed from business cards,
Web site and all other correspondence. I have thrown away stacks of
unwanted faxes, purchased new ink and paper and tried too many times
to mention to send the fax back with my number on it requesting
removal from the autofax services.</LD>
<LD>   All I ever got for my troubles were more faxes. If ever there were
a cause for environmental activists to adopt, it is this one. The
amount of waste and pollution created nationwide from unwanted,
unsolicited faxes must be staggering.</LD>
<LD>   I would love to know how many tons of paper, how many gallons of
ink and how much time it has cost businesses on a yearly basis.</LD>
<TE>   Go get 'em, Steve. Kevin Katz, it's time for you to hide now. You
have violated my rights long enough.</TE>

<TE>   I am a recently widowed senior citizen who kept my husband's
combination telephone/fax machine for its answering feature. But the
barrage of junk faxes received in the last few months forced me to
purchase a plain telephone with an answering unit.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Katz's promise at the bottom of each fax to remove one's
telephone number from his database upon request is a cruel hoax--my
countless calls were to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.2-trillion lawsuit is hardly enough for such an egregious
corporate practice.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since Walt Disney Co. opened California Adventure, I've read The
Times' stories with interest about the park struggling ["Theme Parks
Still Looking for Visitors," Aug. 24].</LD>
<LD>   What never gets mentioned in your articles is one simple,
underlying truth: Disneyland was founded in innocent times by a
creative genius with a magical vision for something totally new,
innovative and spectacularly fun, that would also make money and keep
Mickey Mouse in the public eye.</LD>
<LD>   California Adventure was founded in the 1990s by a board of
directors looking for new revenue streams, market share and a way to
grow the value of Disney's stock. I won't even cast negative light on
that; it's just pure and simple business.</LD>
<TE>   But the public knows or senses this, which is why they aren't
returning.</TE>
<TE>   Just walk around California Adventure. My recollection is a park
jammed with booths, every single one requiring financial
participation.</TE>
<TE>   I felt absolutely no cultural nourishment; instead, I subtly felt
like a sucker for just another big-business venture.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe your article ["Some Farmers Are Skeptical of Ads for
State's Produce," Aug. 23] concerning the "California Grown"
advertising campaign left the impression that most agricultural
producers believe the program will be ineffective in the promotion of
our products.</LD>
<LD>   As a table grape producer with direct foreign competition, I feel
a campaign directed at promoting California-grown products will be
useful.</LD>
<LD>   The idea that consumers do not care where their produce comes from
is not supported by research done by virtually every commodity board.
It also is not supported by the actions taken by almost every
importing group when they vehemently opposed the country-of-origin
legislation recently passed at the federal level.</LD>
<TE>   Most consumers do know, as the governor pointed out in your
article, that California does have the most stringent environmental
health standards, and helping consumers identify California products
with advertising and in-store signage will be helpful.</TE>

<HD>Conflict Over Eisner's Salary</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Apparently, Michael Eisner's salary has migrated from facts to urban
legend.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, in the first 15 years he was at Walt Disney Co. he was
fabulously paid. But he does not get, as John Jaeger asserts
["Unimpressed by Eisner's Disney Stock Purchase," Letters, Aug. 25],
$200 million annually.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, Eisner cashed in options and netted $565 million. He was
able to do so because he took over a moribund company on the verge of
breakup and increased its value twentyfold in 12 years, creating $43
billion in new wealth for shareholders. This payout occurred in
November 1996, making the news.</LD>
<TE>   The single event was treated as news in three succeeding years,
giving the impression he got $500 million for three straight years.
He didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has done lousy recently. And so has Eisner's pay. He's been
getting only a few million a year lately. Plenty for you and me, but
nothing close to $200 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lettuce Grows Into a Processed Food" [Aug. 19] compares commodity
lettuce with ready--to-eat packaged salads and in so doing may have
created the wrong impression.</LD>
<LD>   The article equates the "shape" of heads of lettuce with quality.
In truth, at Fresh Express, the field selection of lettuces destined
for our ready-to-eat salads is based solely upon "eating" quality,
texture and taste. If the quality is high, the shape of the lettuce
head is irrelevant because the taste experience will be superior.</LD>

<HD>''Til Debt Do Us Part' Is Extravagant Couple's Vow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm getting married in November. I make about $50,000 a
year and my fiancee makes about $20,000. We are saving vigorously for
the wedding because it will be costing us and her parents about
$35,000, including the honeymoon. We are on target to afford it, so
no worries there. However, we will be maxing out our credit cards and
we are hoping that the wedding gift money will pay off as much as 75%
of the credit card debt. Any leftover debt can be paid off within a
year, tops. Unfortunately, her car is really a wreck, and I fear for
her safety. My question is: Should we get her a new car now or wait
until after the wedding?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: By the time this column appears, you probably will have
bought the car. You're not the kind of folks who defer gratification
very well.</LD>
<LD>   But here goes anyway.</LD>
<TE>   First of all, you are not on target to afford your wedding. You're
going into debt and expecting your guests to help bail you out. Maybe
they will, maybe they won't. In many circles, gifts of cash are seen
as a bit gauche, so you may not rake in as much as you expect.</TE>
<TE>   Maxing out your credit cards to pay for anything is a fool's game.
It damages your credit, usually results in higher interest rates and
leaves you vulnerable to any financial setback that comes along.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, if you have to pay for something with a credit card and
can't pay off the bill at the end of the month, then you can't afford
it. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but a wedding isn't one
of them. And a wedding with costs that represent half your income is
simply insane.</TE>
<TE>   So is the idea of buying a new car when you're shelling out money
and going into debt at such a pace. If her car truly is not drivable,
then buying a used car, preferably with cash, would be a better
option. At the very least she, not you, should be buying the car.
There's no reason to take on joint debt until you're legally married.</TE>
<TE>   You included in your e-mail a long explanation of why you couldn't
possibly ask your future bride to scale back her expectations. Unless
you two get on the same page financially, though, you're dooming
yourself to a lifetime of debt, stress and unreasonable demands. A
wise woman realizes it's stupid to start married life in a deep
financial hole and is willing to help craft a celebration that
matches the available resources.</TE>
<TE>   Adding a Child to a Deed Can Be Tricky</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently responded to a question from someone whose mother
had added him to the deed of a home. You said that the home would get
a full step-up in basis for tax purposes when the mother died. I
showed your column to an estate planning lawyer, and he said your
reply should say that the house would not receive the stepped-up cost
basis at the mother's death, but that the child would inherit the
mother's cost basis. I hope your answer is the correct one, because
the difference could mean thousands of dollars in taxes. Can you
confirm which amount is the correct cost basis for capital gains
taxes?</TE>
<TE>   A: A lot of smart people get this one wrong, but it's a little
scary that an estate planner would.</TE>
<TE>   What's tricky is that adding a child to a deed qualifies as a gift
for gift tax purposes but does not prevent a home from being included
in a parent's estate, said Bruno Graziano, estate tax expert for CCH
Inc., a tax research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, when you make a gift, the money or asset moves out of
your estate and into the estate of the recipient. If the gift is
large enough (more than $11,000 this year), you're required to file a
gift tax return. If your lifetime gifts total more than $1 million,
you're required to pay gift tax on the excess.</TE>
<TE>   You make a gift when you add a child to the deed of a home as a
joint tenant, as well. But instead of moving a portion of the home
out of the parent's estate, it stays in, and the IRS includes the
entire value of the property in the parent's estate when he or she
dies, Graziano said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the entire home is included in the estate for tax
purposes, the whole thing gets a step-up in tax basis. For example,
if the mother paid $20,000 for the home and it was worth $100,000 at
her death, the child who was included as a joint tenant would have to
pay capital gains taxes only if the house sold for more than
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The exception is if the child helped pay for the home or paid the
parent to be added to the deed. Then it's not really a gift, and a
portion of the home could be kept out of the estate. That's usually
not the case, however.</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely event that gift tax was paid on the original
transfer, the estate would receive a credit to offset some of the
estate tax that might be owed.</TE>
<TE>   Any good estate-planning book talks about the rule of contribution
or the Internal Revenue code section that requires a joint-tenancy
asset be included in the estate unless the survivor can prove that he
or she contributed to its purchase. Probably the
easiest-to-understand treatment of this principle is included in
"Plan Your Estate" by Denis Clifford and Cora Jordan (Nolo Press,
2002). You might pick up a copy for your friend.</TE>

<HD>Grape Growing Going High-Tech</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREENFIELD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A windsock flaps in the breeze just above Scheid Vineyards Inc.'s
Chardonnay vines. Thirty feet away, a digital camera mounted on a
pole turns suddenly and snaps its picture, transmitting it to the
grape grower's Web site for its winery clients.</LD>
<LD>   There, wineries that have contracts for Scheid's grapes can check
out the weather, look at satellite maps of their block of vines and
examine sugar and pH readings and soil analyses to decide the exact
time that their crop should be harvested.</LD>
<LD>   This electronic baby-sitting is custom farming at its most
high-tech and an example of how far grape growers are going these
days to hold on to their winery customers at a time when grapes are
flooding the market.</LD>
<TE>   Contract grape growers such as Salinas-based Scheid, which farms
6,000 acres in Monterey County, usually fare better than Central
Valley growers who sell on the open market. Growers under contract
can set prices over a longer period.</TE>
<TE>   But even contract growers are not immune from this year's glut.
Contracts with many growers are being renegotiated at lower prices
and for less volume in coming years. After years of keeping
winemakers at arm's length, growers are trying to involve them in
more decisions about caretaking and harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   "The more they know, the happier they feel," said Scott Scheid,
president of Scheid Vineyards. "Our customers buy grapes all over the
coast. They have a lot to keep track of. We want them to know more
about our grapes than anybody's."</TE>
<TE>   Grapes are the biggest cost in the production of luxury wines, so
winemakers are monitoring grapes more closely at every step of the
growing process.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the weather forecast and you know it's going to
rain and your brix [grape sugar content] is close to target I'll call
... and say it's time to harvest," said James "Pebble" Smith, a
grower relations manager with Fetzer Vineyards who oversees 25
contract growers handling 1,500 acres of grapes. "It's almost allowed
me to do my job from my desktop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scheid, whose shares trade on Nasdaq, is the first grower to offer
this Web-based grape information system to its winery clients, which
include Geyser Peak, Niebaum-Coppola and Blackstone. The company
earned $2.5 million in fiscal 2001 on sales of $21.7 million, a 25%
increase from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The winery also sends daily e-mails with readings that show how
the grapes are maturing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, two months after its launch, the technology, called
VitWatch, is far from perfect. The camera in the Greenfield vineyard
is the only one in use. The picture quality isn't that good, and
without a high-speed Web connection, streaming video is choppy.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a start. And in the weeks ahead, the company plans to
move a camera from vineyard to vineyard to allow winemakers to see
their grapes being harvested.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just so cool," Smith said. "The downside is I find
myself sitting there going through all of these [stats and pictures]
and end up wasting a lot of time on the computer."</TE>

<HD>Lessons of Booming Late '90s Offer Promise for Labor
Outlook</HD>

<LD>The outlook for jobs and income for American workers is probably
better than it seems this Labor Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Tepid job creation and growing unemployment threaten the current
weak recovery. But lessons from the 1990s boom offer some reassurance
about the economic patterns that will govern this decade.</LD>
<LD>   The late '90s, a period now reviled for dot-com busts and CEO
delinquencies, was a great period of growing prosperity for all
American workers.</LD>
<TE>   The combination of technological advances in U.S. business and
full employment led to gains in family income that reversed 20 years
of income stagnation. That's the finding of "The State of Working
America," a 400-page study to be released this week by the Economic
Policy Institute, a labor-backed Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Productivity increases led to rising living standards, says the
institute, which doesn't often praise corporate efficiencies. A
companion study, "The State of Working California," notes a rise in
low-wage jobs amid unprecedented growth of employment and income
during the boom in this state.</TE>
<TE>   The studies, undertaken every two years and timed for release on
the Labor Day weekend, are authoritative on the strengths and
weaknesses of the U.S. economy and labor picture.</TE>
<TE>   But in their praise this year of the productivity-and
employment-rich late '90s, they raise the question of how success was
achieved and whether it can and will be repeated in this decade. The
evidence is encouraging, despite flaws in the economy that need to be
corrected.</TE>
<TE>   The labor outlook for the next few years is promising. "There will
be a shortage of young people entering the labor force," notes
economist Daniel J.B. Mitchell of UCLA, and that could prompt a
return of the labor shortages of the late '90s, when construction
firms, restaurants and all sorts of businesses--not just high-tech
companies--competed for workers.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other factor, that full employment environment led
to the rise in U.S. median family income, to more than $52,000 a year
in 2000, from levels in the mid-$40,000s, where incomes had stalled
since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Wage growth was evident particularly among "middle-and
lower-income families, whose economic fortunes had stagnated in prior
years," says the Economic Policy Institute study.</TE>
<TE>   There is no labor shortage at the moment. On the contrary,
unemployment is rising and the U.S. labor force of more than 140
million grew by only 6,000 jobs in July. But as the economy recovers
next year and beyond, young workers will be needed and the numbers of
new entrants to the job markets are far fewer than the 2 million-plus
young baby boomers who hit the job markets every year in the 1970s.
Trying to make work for them all prompted policies that led to high
inflation and other economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   The other big factor in the late '90s triumph was gains in
productivity, the achievement of getting more output for the same
input of labor or investment. Productivity increased 5% a year in the
late '90s, which in the vast U.S. economy is equal to a bonus of $500
billion in economic activity-- enough to create 10 million jobs or
improve pay for existing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The gains of the period came from computers and communications
systems allowing businesses to operate globally with maximum
information. "We knew every morning what was happening in each of our
plants all over the world," says Lawrence Bossidy, retired chairman
of Honeywell International Inc., who has just published a book,
"Execution" (Crown Business, 2002), about managing modern
enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff from such knowledge was control over investment,
production and inventories. In short, information technology allowed
efficient use of capital and resources and made more money available
for all purposes, including paying the employees.</TE>
<TE>   Investment in information technology has declined sharply from
levels of the late '90s, a main reason for the economy's
sluggishness. But investment will revive because businesses and
institutions need to upgrade constantly to reduce costs and improve
operations in a world of global cost pressures.</TE>
<TE>   There are widespread effects on the U.S. labor market from the
global patterns of industry and commerce. With so much routine
manufacturing work moving to lower-wage countries in Asia and Latin
America, companies in the U.S. engage in the work of management,
finance, marketing and other functions that put a premium on educated
employees but have fewer good-paying jobs for those with less than a
college education.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of U.S. manu-facturing employment also has reduced the
power of unions. Labor disputes these days often turn on union
attempts to preserve health benefits or prevent outsourcing of work
to nonunion or non-U.S. contractors. The present contract
negotiations between Boeing Co. and the International Assn. of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) reflect union concerns on such
issues. The IAM, which represents Boeing's commercial airplane
workers, intends to meet with a federal mediator Wednesday to discuss
the company's latest offer.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the transfer of manufacturing work to other
countries and states has reduced high-wage and benefit jobs, says
"The State of Working California" report of the California Budget
Commission, a private agency that shares research with the Economic
Policy Institute. As a result, median family incomes in California
rose more slowly than those of the rest of the country in the late
'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Where California once was far ahead of other states in terms of
family income, now it is among the pack, with slightly lower family
incomes than New Jersey, Illinois, Michigan, New York and
Pennsylvania, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   A benefit of such studies is that they report changes in how
Americans work and live now. The latest "State of Working America"
reports that families added 20 hours to their workweek in recent
years, meaning that more workers worked full time or had multiple
jobs. The increased work also accounts in part for the growth in
incomes and productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurance coverage increased for U.S. workers in the late
'90s, after falling for more than a decade--another example of
productivity gains raising living standards. Such job-provided
benefits could be in danger if the economic recovery falters.</TE>
<TE>   What's the outlook? Not surprisingly, economists differ. Donald
Straszheim, an independent economist based in Los Angeles, sees years
of slow growth ahead, with the economy hard-pressed to create the
required 115,000 jobs a month for newcomers to the work force.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Edward Yardeni of Prudential Securities sees a gradually
improving recovery, similar to the so-called jobless recovery of the
early 1990s, when defense spending declined after the fall of the
Berlin Wall.</TE>
<TE>   The new decade is different. Defense spending is rising
dramatically in the wake of last year's terror attacks, and that
alone promises a wide variety of jobs in the economy. So does the
hiring that will be done for homeland security programs.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, the global scope of U.S. companies and institutions
holds out the promise that increasing productivity and high
employment again will lift living standards of U.S. workers in this
decade.</TE>

<HD>Net Casinos Find They Can't Bet on Plastic</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet gambling, once seen as one of the Web's big potential
moneymakers, may turn out to be a loser bet because U.S. credit card
companies and payment systems refuse to do business with online
casinos.</LD>
<LD>   Although boycotts by major credit card issuers and PayPal Inc. are
in effect only in the United States, that's where more than half of
the world's online gamblers live, gambling industry analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by Bank of America, Citibank, Direct Merchants Credit
Card Bank and other major issuers not to honor transactions with
offshore casinos and sports-book operations stems not from moral
qualms about gambling but from murky state and federal laws that make
it possible for customers to wriggle out of debts.</LD>
<TE>   Seven of the top 10 credit card issuers refuse online casino
transactions. Without the participation of major credit card
companies or a payment service such as PayPal, it is considerably
more difficult to place a bet online even in states such as Nevada
where gambling is legal.</TE>
<TE>   "It changes everything," said Michael Caselli, editor of Gambling
Online magazine. "It does not mean that people will stop gambling
online. People did not stop drinking during Prohibition." But, he
said, "it has made online casinos rethink the way they transact their
business."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts who once predicted Internet gambling would become a
$6.2-billion annual enterprise by next year now predict global
receipts of $4.2 billion--or less than half the $9.3 billion that
Nevada casinos take in.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Ader of Bear Stearns Cos. said the credit card company
defections are symptomatic of deeper problems for Internet gambling,
a loose-knit, lightly regulated industry made up of an estimated
1,400 sites headquartered in such locales as Costa Rica and Vanuatu.</TE>
<TE>   The sites offer an array of casino games, including interactive
blackjack, poker, craps, roulette and slot machines. They look
similar to electronic games, such as video poker, available in
bricks-and-mortar casinos. Some sites also offer wagering on sports,
the Academy Awards and even how long a celebrity marriage might last.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has to get regulation, it has to get control of the
process," Ader said. "People have to be convinced of the integrity of
the games. Las Vegas and Atlantic City did it, and maybe they have to
get involved to put together a system that will work."</TE>
<TE>   But the major casinos will take only tentative steps until the
legal situation in the U.S. is resolved. MGM Mirage plans to launch
its Internet casino, based on the Isle of Man, this year, but it will
not take bets from Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not worth the problems it could cause," said MGM
spokesman Alan Feldman. "The lack of legal clarity makes it
untenable."</TE>
<TE>   Several online casinos that take bets from Americans would not
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card companies do not shy away from gambling in general. At
bricks-and-mortar casinos in Nevada, credit cards can be used at
cashier booths and bank machines for cash advances. In states such as
California where online horse betting is legal, credit cards can be
used to set up wagering accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But the largely unorganized world of online casinos is a Wild
West, not unlike Las Vegas was before regulations were established.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts say no states have laws that explicitly
prohibit placing a bet with an offshore casino from a home computer.
But facilitating that bet by using a credit card or payment service
may be illegal, depending on interpretation of laws such as those
that banned telephone betting across state lines.</TE>
<TE>   The case that unsettled the industry occurred in 1999, when a
Marin County, Calif., woman racked up $115,000 in Internet gambling
debts on various credit cards. She not only refused to pay, but also
sued the credit card companies for allowing her to engage in what she
said was illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Countersuits followed, but before the matter went to court for
what could have been a major legal test, a gambling software company
not named in the suits stepped forward to bankroll a settlement and
pay the legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   The attempt to keep the system operating smoothly didn't
work--more gamblers refused to pay their losses and credit card
companies began to bail.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept hearing about suits from people who would take the
stance: 'You should have never authorized it in the first place, so
I'm not going to pay you back,' " said Matt Melius, who oversees
credit risk management for Direct Merchants, which has about 5
million card holders in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Melius said he was not aware of any of the bank's customers
fighting a major gambling charge, but the bank stopped accepting
online casino transactions anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get out of it ahead of any problems it might cause
for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To the credit card industry, which processed more than $3.15
trillion worth of transactions last year through Visa and MasterCard
alone, handling online gambling transactions were hardly worth the
possible legal trouble.</TE>
<TE>   New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, best known for his
investigations of brokerages' roles in the stock bubble, began
looking into credit card companies' role in the industry, taking the
stance that the facilitation of online gambling was illegal in that
state. Citibank, the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. with
about 12% of the business, was under scrutiny by his office when it
struck a deal in June to quit taking the bets, donate $400,000 to
agencies that counsel chronic gamblers and pay New York state
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Spitzer agreed not to sue.</TE>
<TE>   He did sue PayPal, which acted as a middleman for credit card
companies. In a settlement announced Aug. 21, PayPal agreed to get
out of the online casino business in the state and pay $200,000 in
penalties and investigation costs.</TE>
<TE>   Online auctioneer EBay Inc. is acquiring PayPal in a $1.5-billion
deal and plans to take the payment service out of the gambling
business.</TE>
<TE>   Caselli, editor of Gambling Online, said PayPal's exit from the
industry has had a "massive effect.... PayPal has been the crutch the
online gaming community used since credit cards became a problem."</TE>
<TE>   With little hope that the legal situation will be resolved soon,
online casinos are looking for alternatives to credit cards.
Electronic systems similar to PayPal are being courted, and one
operation is trying a pay-telephone system that puts gambling charges
directly on a phone bill.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Tew of Bear Stearns is confident that a pay system will
spring up to replace PayPal.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is still growing at a healthy rate at this point,"
Tew said. "But the big question is, how resilient will gamblers be in
looking for new forms of payment?"</TE>
<TE>   Caselli predicted that credit card companies would return to the
business if a way is found to determine the location of a gambler
making a bet, thus limiting online gambling to states in which it is
clearly legal. Systems involving global positioning system units and
other technologies are in the works. He expects them to be ready to
roll out in about a year.</TE>
<TE>   "When we can go to the credit card companies and say, 'We can tell
you where everyone is,' " Caselli said, "I think $5 billion in
transactions is enough to convince them to come back."</TE>

<LD>2 Ex-Execs of WorldCom</LD>
<LD>   Facing Fraud Charges</LD>
<LD>   Two former top executives of WorldCom Inc. were indicted on
securities fraud and other charges.</LD>
<TE>   The move is seen as a key step as the government works to build a
case against former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers, legal
experts said. Ebbers' lawyers contend that he had no knowledge of the
accounting scheme under which profit allegedly was inflated by
billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors accused Scott D. Sullivan, the 40-year-old
former chief financial officer of WorldCom, and Buford Yates Jr., the
company's former director of general accounting, of directing a
two-year scheme to conceal $3.9 billion in company expenses and boost
profit.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also names two other WorldCom accounting
executives, Betty Vinson and Troy Normand, as unindicted
co-conspirators. But court documents filed Wednesday indicate that
Vinson and Normand--along with former Controller David Myers--are
prepared to plead guilty and cooperate with the government.</TE>
<TE>   If fraud is proved, it would be the largest accounting scandal in
U.S. history. WorldCom, the once highflying telecommunications giant
that carries nearly half of the country's Internet traffic, owns MCI,
the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a congressional committee investigating Citigroup
Inc.'s allocations of sought-after initial public offerings said it
wants to know how much money WorldCom executives and directors made
from their awards.</TE>
<TE>   The House Financial Services Committee plans to serve the world's
largest financial services company with a second subpoena in a month
to seek information on transactions involving Ebbers, Sullivan and
others.</TE>

<TE>   Gotcha Seeks Chapter 11</TE>
<TE>   Amid Legal Dispute</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha International, a pioneering Southern California surf wear
company that was once a dominant player in the market, has filed for
reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code amid a bitter legal
battle with a business partner.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine-based company was forced to file for Chapter 11
protection because of a dispute with Ederal Sport Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Ederal, which began manufacturing Gotcha brand clothing under
license three years ago, sued Gotcha last fall, claiming Gotcha
misrepresented its sales when the licensing deal was struck.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha disputed the allegation and filed a countersuit against
Ederal, citing failure to pay royalties and other problems. The issue
is still in court, but the dispute made it harder for Gotcha to sell
products and deprived it of royalties, Gotcha President Donald Grier
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gotcha rose to prominence in the 1970s, along with Quiksilver Inc.
of Huntington Beach, now the world's largest surf wear maker. The
companies followed a path trod by pioneer brands Hang 10 and Ocean
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Sun, Novellus Outlook</TE>
<TE>   a Blow to Tech Sector</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for a technology rebound dimmed with lackluster sales
forecasts from Sun Microsystems Inc. and Novellus Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, UBS Warburg cut its 2002 and 2003 projections for the
global semiconductor and chip-equipment industries, saying sluggish
demand for personal computers and telecommunications equipment could
drive down revenue.</TE>
<TE>   UBS expects 2002 chip revenue to fall as much as 2% or rise as
much as 2%.</TE>
<TE>   It previously predicted sales would be unchanged or grow as much
as 5%. It changed its forecast for chip-equipment revenue to a drop
of 20% to 25% from a decline of 15% to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun, which makes servers that run
corporate networks and Web sites, said first-quarter sales would be
little changed from $2.86 billion a year ago, at the low end of
forecasts made in July.</TE>
<TE>   Novellus said it would break even in the third quarter on sales of
$230 million, compared with an earlier forecast of a profit of 2
cents a share on sales of $250 million.</TE>

<TE>   Target Pulls Clothing on Neo-Nazi Allegation</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp. pulled clothing bearing "88" and "Eight Eight" from
its shelves after complaints that the numbers are code for "Heil
Hitler" among neo-Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   The Minneapolis-based discounter issued a statement apologizing
"for any discomfort" that may have been caused by the baseball caps
with the numerals "88" and shorts bearing images of skulls and the
words "Eight Eight."</TE>
<TE>   "Target is a family-oriented store and company, and it is not our
intent to carry any merchandise that promotes hate," the statement
said. "Target does not and will not tolerate discrimination in any
form."</TE>
<TE>   Groups upset about the clothing say they want to know how such
designs ended up on Target apparel bearing one of the retailer's
private labels, Utility.</TE>
<TE>   Target officials did not return calls seeking comment. One analyst
who follows the company said that the design approval process often
is slapdash and that it's highly unlikely Target officials had any
clue about the Nazi symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sony Finally Throwing Betamax on Scrapheap</TE>
<TE>   Sony Corp. has given up on Betamax.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese electronics giant said it would stop making the last
two models of the Betamax videocassette recorder by year's end. The
company made fewer than 3,000 of the VCRs last year and sold them
only in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Betamax format was technically superior, it was
quickly overrun by the rival VHS format, which had captured more than
75% of the consumer market by the early 1980s. The Betamax brand name
has since come to symbolize the limited power of good engineering in
consumer electronics--the best technology doesn't always win.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was merely a formality for consumers in the
United States. Betamax VCRs disappeared from U.S. store shelves at
least a decade ago, as did most Betamax tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, an underground community of "Betaphiles" lives on, buying
and refurbishing used machines, scrounging for parts and ordering
tapes of movies made before George Clooney's first hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Combined HP Posts Loss of $2.03 Billion</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co. reported a $2.03-billion loss for its fiscal
third quarter in its first combined results since buying Compaq
Computer Corp. in the largest technology merger in history, as sales
fell in most of its product lines.</TE>
<TE>   HP's loss amounted to 67 cents a share in the three months ended
July 31. HP said the combined companies would have reported a
year-earlier loss of $116 million, or 4 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding $2.4 billion in merger costs, investment losses,
litigation expenses and other write-downs, pro forma per-share profit
came to 14 cents for the recent quarter, matching analysts'
predictions.</TE>

<TE>   SEC Tightens Deadlines for Company Disclosures</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to shorten the amount
of time companies have to report earnings and to require stock trades
by corporate insiders to be disclosed within two days. The moves,
aimed at shoring up investor confidence in a year racked by financial
scandals, were applauded by industry representatives and shareholder
activists.</TE>
<TE>   The changes, approved unanimously by the five-member SEC, come on
two fronts:</TE>
<TE>   First, detailed quarterly and annual financial statements will
have to be filed more quickly with the SEC. That will reduce the risk
that companies will issue rosy news releases about their earnings
only to reveal problems important to investors months later in their
official SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the rules will require company insiders--high-ranking
executives, directors and major shareholders--to report the details
of their stock trades more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Industry groups, which had objected to the SEC's plan to shorten
the filing period for financial reports, were mollified by the
agency's decision to phase in new deadlines over a three-year period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Few Firms Plan to Air Commercials on 9/11</TE>
<TE>   Nextel Communications Inc. said it will once again underwrite CBS'
broadcast of "9/11" on Sept. 11, following President Bush's planned
televised address to the nation. Nextel was the exclusive underwriter
in March when CBS first aired the documentary about New York
firefighters, which drew 52 million viewers, one of this year's
largest TV audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel joins Boeing Co., which has agreed to underwrite NBC's live
broadcast of the "Concert for America," from the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, Nextel and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. are among a small group of
advertisers that plan to be on the air Sept. 11. ABC, CBS and NBC
said some frims have expressed interest in advertising on that day,
but most have declined rather than risk offending anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions underscore the challenge advertisers and networks
face as they decide how to respectfully recognize the one-year
anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</TE>

<TE>   California Senate</TE>
<TE>   Widens Music Probe</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate has widened its probe of music industry
accounting practices and is checking into whether major record firms
defrauded artists out of royalties through undisclosed licensing
deals with record clubs and video channels.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Rules Committee has issued subpoenas seeking documents
from artists' lawyers and managers to substantiate the allegations,
which first came to light at a hearing in July called by Sen. Martha
Escutia (D-Whittier) and Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) to examine
the industry's accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Artist representatives accuse the world's five largest music
companies of collecting millions of dollars annually from licensing
deals with record clubs and video channels that are never shared with
artists. Attorneys also alleged that companies use fraudulent
accounting formulas to bilk artists out of earnings on music sold
overseas. The companies dispute the allegations.</TE>

<HD>'Loyalty' Programs Can Help Build Savings for College Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Piponnian's relatives are spending her way to college.</LD>
<LD>   Her parents, grandparents and an aunt have all signed on to a
"loyalty" buying program called Upromise that rebates a small
percentage of their purchases and sweeps them into a college savings
account for the La Habra Heights teen. In less than a year, more than
$400 in rebates has been deposited into the account.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the rebates won't be nearly enough to finance four
years of higher education. But it's a start--or, rather, a supplement
to the savings that her family already has started.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is something that every person who has a child who
is dear to them ought to do," said Jennifer's father, Pierre
Piponnian, a financial consultant with Salomon Smith Barney in
Pasadena. "It's not a huge amount, but it makes a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts-based Upromise is just one of three companies that
offer rebate programs to help parents pay for college. BabyMint,
headquartered in Atlanta, and Plano, Texas-based EdExpress offer
similar, yet slightly different, programs.</TE>
<TE>   All three are so-called loyalty programs, which operate much like
airline frequent-flier plans. When participating consumers shop with
participating merchants or buy certain brands of merchandise--such as
Kellogg's cereal--they get a cash rebate that can range from 1% to
20% of the purchase price. Instead of getting a check or credits
toward a free airline ticket, the cardholder directs the rebates into
a college fund for a designated beneficiary.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three companies--BabyMint and Upromise--also offer
credit cards that are similar to the frequent-flier cards available
through MasterCard, Visa and other issuers. No matter where the cards
are used, 1% of the charges is rebated to a college savings account.
If you charge $18,000 a year, for instance, you'll get $180 in
rebates.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Upromise nor BabyMint charge an annual fee for the
cards--a nice contrast to frequent-flier cards, for which annual fees
can run as high as $75. The interest rates and credit limits on the
cards vary, depending on the borrower's credit standing.</TE>
<TE>   Beneficiaries of the savings generated from loyalty and credit
card purchases can be either the participant, the participant's
child, a relative or a friend--or, in some cases, a university or
charity that the participant would like to help. Participants can
switch beneficiaries at any time.</TE>
<TE>   An unlimited number of participants can sign up to help a single
beneficiary, which can turbo-charge the savings prospect for a youth
with lots of friends with rebate accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been a proponent of getting something for nothing,"
said Ilyce Glink, a financial columnist and author of "50 Simple
Things You Can Do To Improve Your Personal Finances." "If you are
going to make the purchases to begin with, this is just an extension
of that."</TE>
<TE>   The danger, said Glink, is if consumers buy things they ordinarily
wouldn't--picking up the brand-name cereal rather than the cheaper
plain-wrap version, for example--just to get the rebate.</TE>
<TE>   "We go for the cheapest price always," said Glink, who has hooked
her credit cards into the Upromise program to benefit her two sons.
"It's much better for you to save $50 on your own than to spend extra
money on their [branded] products and have them kick some of it back
to you."</TE>
<TE>   For those who can use them without altering their normal spending
patterns, these loyalty programs are an almost pain-free way to help
someone pay for college, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to pay the entire tuition check through gas
purchases and buying Kellogg's cereal," acknowledged Jeff Bussgang,
co-founder of Upromise. "But we are going to supplement your savings
with free money from America's best brands."</TE>
<TE>   The rebates are paid by the retailers and manufacturers that are
linked to the three programs or, in the case of the branded credit
cards, by the card issuer.</TE>
<TE>   Participating companies--which include Gap Inc., Amazon.com Inc.
and Sharper Image Corp.--provide the rebates as a gimmick to
differentiate one retailer from the next.</TE>
<TE>   Participating retailers are betting that if you're walking through
the mall and can choose among four big department stores that offer
much the same merchandise, you will shop at the one that will put
money in your child's pocket, said Allen Greenly, chief executive of
EdExpress.</TE>
<TE>   Although all three rebate programs employ the same basic concept,
they aren't identical.</TE>
<TE>   Upromise has, by far, the most participating retail locations,
including a list of 7,500 restaurants that give diners rebates on
meals. To find a participating restaurant, program members can go to
the Upromise Web site and enter the name of the city where they'd
like to dine. The site provides a list of dining locations and the
percentage return that they will earn on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   For people who don't mind shopping online, BabyMint has worked out
cooperative arrangements with about 150 private colleges that have
agreed to match any amount parents save in their BabyMint accounts
with college-based scholarships--effectively doubling the value of
the savings when students attend partnering universities.</TE>
<TE>   EdExpress is the rebate program that charges an annual membership
fee. But it says the $24.95 fee gets you better prices--or in this
case, bigger rebates. BabyMint offers a 4% rebate on household
products purchased at Domestications.com, for example, while
EdExpress offers an 8% rebate on those purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The programs also differ in how they transfer customer rebates
into designated college accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers don't necessarily have to choose one program.
There's nothing to stop them from signing up for all three--or at
least for the two that don't charge annual fees, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The smartest thing to do is join all the programs," said
EdExpress' Greenly. "It gives consumers a wider variety of vendors to
choose from and a wider venue for saving."</TE>

<HD>As Stock Trader, Ebbers Flourished</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers must have been
very busy building up the telecom firm from 1996 through 2000, given
the company's 789% reported revenue growth in that five-year stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, Ebbers also found time to be an active private investor
in that period, according to documents released last week by the
House Financial Services Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Ebbers received shares in 21 initial public stock offerings from
1996 through 2000, brokerage Salomon Smith Barney reported in a
summary it was ordered to turn over to the committee, which is
investigating WorldCom's collapse.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the IPOs Ebbers got were highly coveted by other
investors, which was demonstrated by the hefty gains the stocks made
in their first few trading days. And the data show Ebbers generally
was not the buy-and-hold type--even as telecom analysts at Salomon
and other brokerages urged other investors to hang on.</TE>
<TE>   In early August 2000, for example, Salomon allocated to Ebbers
5,000 IPO shares of Signalsoft  Corp., a wireless telecom services
firm. Ebbers paid the IPO price of $17 a share.</TE>
<TE>   On Signalsoft's first trading day, the stock soared 29%. As it
continued to rise in the weeks after the IPO, Ebbers sold out. He let
go 2,500 shares on Aug. 16, 2000, at $23 each, then sold 1,000 at $41
each on Sept. 5. The final 1,500 shares were sold on Sept. 15 at
$30.39 each, according to the Salomon documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' total profit before taxes on the Signalsoft deal: $59,093,
or a 70% return on his $85,000 investment in six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee's IPO probe is turning up more than the
inevitable rubric that the rich get richer. Congress wants to know
about these stock deals with executives such as Ebbers because they
open a window onto the Wall Street practices that helped inflate the
bull market bubble of the late 1990s--the bursting of which has wiped
out trillions of dollars of paper market wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney, responding to the committee's subpoenas in
recent weeks, detailed how it allocated much-desired IPO shares in
the late '90s to WorldCom officials and how it received expressions
of interest in IPOs from a host of other telecom industry executives.</TE>
<TE>   The telecom business was very good to Salomon: From 1997 through
2001 the brokerage handled more stock and bond underwriting for the
telecom industry than did any other Wall Street firm, according to
data tracker Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   For its efforts, Salomon earned $1.5 billion in fees from telecom
companies in that five-year period, Thomson calculated.</TE>
<TE>   The key question the House committee has posed is whether there
was a connection between the IPO allocations to executives like
Ebbers and the lucrative underwriting work those executives'
companies awarded Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   Under securities laws, such an explicit connection, if
undisclosed, would be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, in a letter Friday to the two senior members of the House
committee--Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) and Rep. John J. LaFalce
(D-N.Y.)--repeated what it has stated before: "We have found no
evidence that shares in IPOs were allocated as a quid pro quo for
investment banking business," wrote Jane C. Sherburne, deputy general
counsel at Salomon parent Citigroup Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A Perk for Top Clients</TE>
<TE>   Brokerages say they typically award hot IPO shares to their best
customers. That isn't against the law; indeed, it would make no sense
for a brokerage to give such shares to its unimportant
customers--say, those with little wealth or influence.</TE>
<TE>   "The WorldCom officers and directors at issue were among Salomon
Smith Barney's best individual customers," Sherburne wrote. "In fact,
their individual accounts put them in approximately the top 1% of SSB
retail clients."</TE>
<TE>   None of that may come as a huge surprise to the committee or to
the general public.</TE>
<TE>   But the extent to which Ebbers and other executives received IPO
shares from 1996 through 2000, and the size of some of the individual
grants, moved Citigroup to concede last week that "some allocations
to corporate officers and directors ... while lawful, were
sufficiently large as to raise questions about the appearance of
conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   The public's sensitivity to the allocations is higher because of
what has since transpired with WorldCom: its plunge into bankruptcy
this summer after revelations that the firm misreported billions of
dollars in expenses to make its financial position appear relatively
rosy in recent years. Ebbers, who resigned as CEO in the spring, is
under federal investigation but has not been charged with wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 through 2000, Ebbers was granted a total of 869,000 IPO
shares, most of which were telecom-related firms. Some were not,
however: He was given 5,000 IPO shares of watch maker Tag Heuer in
1996; in 1999 he got 5,000 IPO shares of United Parcel Service.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Ebbers made money on 17 of the 21 IPOs. His net gain on
the deals, before taxes: $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   He profited largely by selling out of the stocks well before one
year was up. His average holding period for the IPOs was 224 days,
according to Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   Had Ebbers held on, he might have lost millions of dollars instead
of making money, because many of the telecom shares he
received--including Qwest Communications International, Rhythms
Netconnections and Metromedia Fiber Network--have since crumbled. By
selling all of his Qwest shares within two months of the IPO in 1997,
Ebbers earned $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he could have made much more by waiting to sell as the
telecom stock mania peaked, driving Qwest as high as $64 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers earned nearly $4.6 million by selling his Metromedia Fiber
shares between February and October of 1998, after winning the IPO
allocation in October 1997. But as with Qwest, he missed the biggest
runup in Metromedia's shares, which took the price to nearly $50 in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   If Ebbers was too early in selling many of his shares, one of his
holdings illustrates what the penalty would have been for taking a
truly long-term view: He apparently still owns shares of Williams
Communications Group, a 1999 IPO. Salomon said Ebbers has an
unrealized loss of $804,405 on his Williams investment.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, like WorldCom, is in bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Who Called the Moves?</TE>
<TE>   It isn't known whether Ebbers personally directed the purchases
and sales of the IPO shares he received, or whether some or all of
the decisions were made by his Salomon broker. A call to Ebbers'
lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, was not returned Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the question of a quid pro quo for IPO allocations, one
issue that may interest Congress is whether Ebbers and/or his broker
were selling while telecom analysts at Salomon and other Wall Street
firms were exhorting individual investors to continue buying the
shares in question, providing an eager audience.</TE>
<TE>   The House Financial Services Committee in July grilled Salomon's
star telecom analyst, Jack Grubman--who had a close personal
relationship with Ebbers--on why he remained so bullish on many
telecom issues, even as they collapsed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wrote what I believed," Grubman has insisted. He
resigned from Salomon in mid-August, saying the negative publicity
about his record made it impossible for him to continue in the field.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, it may be hard to argue with bullish calls on telecom
IPOs from 1996 through 1999 by Grubman or other analysts. They were
right that the stocks were going higher, thanks to the final massive
wave of tech and telecom mania that swept the market early in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Ebbers already had dumped most of his IPO shares. He
missed the peak, but he still has what many buy-and-hold tech stock
investors do not have: a big profit to show for his efforts.</TE>

<HD>California's Wine Glass Overfilled</HD>
<DH>Wineries and growers are facing a grape glut and an
increase in imports, but consumers are not seeing a drop in prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First came the dot-com bust, wiping out their big-spending Silicon
Valley customers.</LD>
<LD>   Then, the sobering attacks of Sept. 11 almost brought their sales
to a standstill.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, with a sluggish economy depressing demand and a global
grape glut threatening to flood the U.S. market, California's luxury
winemakers refuse to admit that the party's over.</LD>
<TE>   Unwilling to risk their cachet and profit margins, many in
California's $33-billion wine industry are resisting lowering the
price of their wines, even as unsold cases of Cabernet and Chardonnay
pile up in warehouses and foreign wines win a bigger share of U.S.
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked that prices aren't half of what they were last year,"
said Rich Cartiere, editor and publisher of the Wine Market Report, a
Calistoga, Calif.-based industry newsletter. "We are entering a
period of hyper-competition. There is an enormous worldwide supply of
wine and the [California] wine industry has just not adjusted.
Reality has not yet set in for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Although some winemakers have reacted to the glut by shaving a few
dollars off their $7-to-$12 California Chardonnays and Cabs, wineries
with more-expensive labels are socking away cases to wait for a
better market.</TE>
<TE>   But the wait might be a long one. California wine grape growers
are turning out 52% more grapes today than just seven years ago,
while countries such as Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa
are exporting more wines to the U.S. than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   All this is helping to saturate the U.S. wine market. Wine
analysts say it could take five years to work through this supply,
especially because wine sales in the U.S. are flattening. In the
process, a number of smaller California growers will be forced out of
business as the glut of grapes keeps prices low.</TE>
<TE>   No one will have to work harder to move their wines than
California's high-end winemakers, which have watched their business
plummet in the last year as consumers cut back on travel and
white-tablecloth dinners, and in general buy less wine or
lower-priced varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many winemakers refuse to discount their goods, either because
they have high land costs or are afraid they will tarnish their image
and not be able to command the same lavish prices when supply and
demand fall back into balance.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Mondavi Inc., for example, does not plan to lower the price
of its luxury wines, despite slowing sales. Instead the
Oakville-based winery, whose sales declined 8% in fiscal 2002 from
the previous year, is giving economic incentives to distributors to
push its wines.</TE>
<TE>   Beringer Blass Wine Estates, a unit of beverage giant Foster's
Group Ltd., is actually raising prices, funneling excess Chardonnay
grapes from its Santa Barbara County Meridian vineyard into an even
pricier new label called White Hills, set to debut this month.</TE>
<TE>   But that will be the exception rather than the rule, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Most large winemakers may not have a choice about discounting,
given the amount of good-quality, affordable wine flooding in from
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Even before this year's harvest began last month, the pace of
domestic wine sales in supermarkets, drugstores and discounters had
begun to slow, inching up a paltry 1.4% in the 52 weeks ended July
14, according to Chicago-based Information Resources Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, sales of Australian, Italian and other imported wines
shot up 12.5% in the same period, according to IRI, upping their
share of all U.S. wine sales to 17.9% from 16.7% the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a defining year for most producers here in
California when you combine the excess inventory that's out there ...
and the economic slump across the board," said George Rose, a
spokesman for British beverage giant Allied Domecq, which owns such
brands as Clos du Bois, Buena Vista, Callaway and Mumm Cuvee Napa.
"The bubble has definitely burst."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of its luxury wine competitors, Allied Domecq has
begun trimming a few dollars off the prices of its Sonoma County
wines to boost sales. At the same time, the company is planning
lower-priced wines under new brand names to shed excess juice.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for consumers is that this should mean
better-quality wine at all price levels, from the $7 bottle of
Sauvignon Blanc to a $120 reserve Cabernet.</TE>
<TE>   "What it takes to get a 95 [top rating] in Wine Spectator today is
a lot different than it was 10 years ago. And it's going to get a lot
harder," said Jim Watkins, who heads Beringer Blass operations in the
Americas.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in wine quality is partly the result of growers
thinning and pruning their vines to reduce production. Fewer grapes
on the vine mean more intense flavor.</TE>
<TE>   "[Vintners] are very excited about the fruit quality this year. It
will be a tremendous vintage year," said Karen Ross, president of the
California Assn. of Winegrape Growers.</TE>
<TE>   But even with this pruning, California's 2002 wine-grape crush is
expected to be 3.3 million tons, about 10% larger than last year's.
That has sent grape prices plunging as much as 50% on the open
market.</TE>
<TE>   Especially overplanted are popular varietals Chardonnay, Cabernet
and Pinot Noir. With prices coming down on these grape varieties,
more are being used in blending wines, dragging down prices for other
blending grapes such as Barbera and Grenache.</TE>
<TE>   Cabernet grapes are selling for as little as $100 to $200 a ton on
the open market, just a tenth of what some growers were getting at
the market's peak in the late 1990s, said Barry Bedwell, general
manager of grape brokerage Ciatti &amp; Co. At current prices, he said,
growers are losing money.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the state's last wine cooperative, East Side Winery in
Lodi, went under and its assets were sold at auction two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although growers may be able to swallow another year's worth of
losses, it's unlikely they can do it for several years running.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was the strong punch in the stomach" as prices
plummeted, Ross said. Some growers in the San Joaquin Valley already
have begun looking for another crop to cultivate.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll start a [vine] pullout right after harvest," at the end
of fall, Ross said. "It's a sad, harsh reality for farm families that
have been in the grape business for many years."</TE>
<TE>   To keep up with the industry dynamics, Madera grape grower John
Simpson has started working to improve the quality of his grapes. He
has thinned vines and used trellises to better shade grapes from the
hot San Joaquin Valley sun and develop more-subtle flavors.</TE>
<TE>   He also has started his own small label, Simpson Meadows. Although
just a small part of his business, it quickly is becoming a source of
great pride and attention. Simpson Meadows Chardonnay recently won a
gold medal in the $10-and-under category at a San Francisco Bay Area
wine-tasting event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still in its infancy," Simpson said. "But we're very happy
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ross believes that some California winemakers, particularly
producers of lower-priced wines from the Central Coast and northern
San Joaquin Valley, finally can compete with Australian, New Zealand,
Chilean and French producers in export markets such as Britain,
because the low price of grapes will offset higher exchange rates and
tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, exports are a small part of the wine industry's revenue.
Last year, about $13.4 billion worth of California wine was sold in
the U.S. California's products accounted for most of the $541 million
worth of U.S. wines exported at the wholesale level in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In years ahead, many California wines will be peddled by their
Australian rivals. Conglomerates Southcorp Ltd. and Foster's Group,
both based in Australia, have made large investments in California
wine in recent years. Analysts expect this type of global
consolidation to continue as wine companies deal with fewer large
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Medium-sized wine companies will feel the most pressure to seek a
buyer or merger partner to retain a place on retail shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to become more relevant to your distributor," said
Watkins of Beringer Blass, which typically has about 40 types and
sizes of wine in large grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   California wine is fast becoming a smaller category on supermarket
shelves. And with hundreds of new wine brands launched in recent
years, winemakers are having to work harder to promote their brands,
which sometimes means hitting the road for festivals, distributor
dinners and tastings, and even bottle signings at the local Costco.</TE>
<TE>   "We had become complacent and cocky," said Robert Mondavi Chairman
Michael Mondavi. "We in the luxury wine business have a big job to do
in stimulating more consumers ... to drink our wine. Pretension is
out, but there is still the means and the desire to get the top
quality."</TE>

<TE>   When the river rises, a quail will lose its way</TE>

<HD>She's Come Undone</HD>
<DH>MIDDLESEX, A Novel, By Jeffrey Eugenides, Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux: 530 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF TURRENTINE</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is an essayist and critic whose
articles have appeared in Book Review, The New York Times Magazine,
Slate.com and other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myths, whether ancient or modern, are basically designed to take the
vexing mysteries of the universe and reformulate them as stories that
make human sense. Jeffrey Eugenides has only two books to his name;
nevertheless, he's well on his way to becoming a spectacular
mythologist, attacking some of our most enduring riddles with heroic
energy, keen wit and genuine compassion.</LD>
<LD>   In his first novel, 1993's "The Virgin Suicides," the riddle had
to do with the incomprehensibility of grief: how the bereaved
secretly envy the dead and long to join them. (What were the Lisbon
sisters of that novel but lip-glossed suburban Pleiades whose
self-destruction only made their stars shimmer that much more
brightly?) In "Middlesex," his long-awaited follow-up, the riddle is
identity: how it develops, how it's enforced and how gods and
grandparents conspire to devise it long before we're born.</LD>
<LD>   In significant ways, "Middlesex"--a transatlantic epic about a
star-crossed Hellenic family, narrated by an engagingly ironic
hermaphrodite--is the formal opposite of "The Virgin Suicides." The
latter was taut almost to the point of astringency, though shot
through with a dreamy, nocturnal surrealism. Eugenides has had nearly
a decade to relax, and the happy result is a novel that's as warm,
expansive and generous as its predecessor wasn't.</LD>
<TE>   With the exception of the sisters' despondent father, the
characters in "The Virgin Suicides" often seemed to be caryatids:
beautiful and fascinating to behold but cold to the touch. By
contrast, everyone we meet in "Middlesex" is vibrantly alive. As Cal
Stephanides, the 41-year-old narrator, unravels his amazing history,
we come to know his brother, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and
teenage crushes just as we have come to know our own. And in his
exhaustive family inventory, we recognize the many baffling forces at
work during our childhoods that shaped us into the adults we became.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born twice: first as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless
Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in
an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974."</TE>
<TE>   "Middlesex" thus opens with the facts of Cal's biological birth,
but the story doesn't begin there. To arrive at Cal's mythic origin,
we must go back further, to the fiery destruction of Smyrna in 1922
at the hands of a Turkish army bent on cleansing Asia Minor of its
large and centuries-old Greek population. Fleeing the massacre are
Lefty and Desdemona Stephanides, orphaned siblings barely out of
their teens who defy bullets and bayonets to steal away on a ship
bound for New York, from which they hope to proceed to a new life in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   While sailing across the ocean, brother and sister are joined as
husband and wife, formalizing their deep love for each other in an
act of Olympian temerity. Guilt and shame are their wedding
attendants, but once arrived in Detroit they have little time for
reflection or remorse: The brisk business of assimilation is at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Lefty takes a job on the Ford assembly line, learning English at
night and doing his best to adopt the habits and mannerisms of his
new country. Desdemona marvels at the whizzing, clanging icons of
American modernity and bonds with her (and her husband's) cousin
Sourmelina, the only other person on Earth aware of the couple's dark
secret.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Sourmelina's husband, the surly bootlegger Jimmy Zizmo,
they comprise the incestuous genetic crucible from which Cal's
particular condition--a type of stealth hermaphroditism that makes
males appear to be female until the onset of puberty--will emerge two
generations later.</TE>
<TE>   Cal is born Calliope Stephanides in a Detroit that's still a few
years from the race riots of the late 1960s and the end of American
automotive hegemony in the 1970s, before white flight and economic
malaise have taken hold. Among many things, "Middlesex" is the
author's love letter to a city that could probably use a few more.</TE>
<TE>   In Eugenides' hands, Detroit is imbued with all of the rough-hewn
charm of Saul Bellow's Chicago or Joseph Mitchell's New York.
Callie's grandparents learn how to become Americans in its car
factories, streetcars and Greektown cathedrals; her parents fulfill
the ironic mandate of immigrants' American-born children by
high-tailing it out of their ethnic enclave and making a journey of
their own, from hardscrabble city to leafy suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Callie grows up in Grosse Pointe and, once her father's restaurant
business takes off, enjoys the privileges of life in such a place:
private school, summers by the clubhouse pool, friends with vacation
houses. But she and her family are forever subject to the centripetal
force of Detroit's Greektown community, and Callie no more "belongs"
in the rarefied atmosphere of Grosse Pointe than she does in the
teenage girl's body in which she's feeling less and less at home.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time that 14-year-old Callie begins to develop
sexual feelings for her best friend, she doesn't begin to develop
something else: breasts. Her same-sex crush, her stick-like figure,
the disconcerting appearance of a slight mustache and her no-show of
a menstrual cycle are her first clues that the gods are upset. But
everything still seems explainable: Some girls have late puberties,
some have to contend with unwelcome facial hair and (this one is a
bit harder for her to accept) some of them are just "that way."</TE>
<TE>   Not many, though, have a hidden set of male genitals, and when an
emergency-room visit reveals that Callie is indeed among that tiny
fraction of the female population, she can no longer wait in hiding
for nature to correct itself. Her mystified parents take her to New
York, where the protocol of a world-famous sexologist proves too much
for her to bear. Callie runs away and begins a cross-country odyssey
of self-discovery, by the end of which she will have become Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Odysseys, shape-shifters, incest, Sapphic lust and
generation-spanning "curses" fill the book; the list of classical
references and themes that Eugenides leaves out of "Middlesex" might
actually be shorter than the list of those he puts in. The novel even
has a monster: One of the most heartbreakingly poignant moments
revolves around Callie's discovery of that word in the big
leather-bound Webster's at the New York Public Library, where she's
looking up various scientific terms that describe her condition.</TE>
<TE>   All teenagers are half-certain that they're freaks, mutants of
some sort; but to have that suspicion confirmed by scholarly research
is a nightmare that is uniquely Callie's. Eugenides makes us feel
every aspect of her horror and shame.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Campbell once provided a poetic job description for
mythology, declaring that it "opens the world so that it becomes
transparent to something that is beyond speech, beyond words--in
short, what we call transcendence." That's a fine way to characterize
this sweeping, sad, funny and tender story of a girl's unlikely
journey to manhood. Eugenides has taken the greatest mystery of
all--What are we, exactly, and where do we come from?--and crafted a
story that manages to be both illuminating and transcendent.
"Middlesex" isn't just a respectable sophomore effort; it's a
towering achievement, and it can now be stated unequivocally that
Eugenides' initial triumph wasn't a one-off or a fluke. He has
emerged as the great American writer that many of us suspected him of
being.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch is the author of "The Woman Who Laughed
at God: The Untold History of the Jewish People." He is a
contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much anxiety is expressed nowadays over the preservation of
structures designed by such famous architects as Richard J. Neutra
and R.M. Schindler. But, at least until now, not much has been said
about the work of William Kesling, a brilliant if also deeply
troubled master builder once sentenced to San Quentin on a conviction
for fraud. Yet Kesling surely deserves to be included among the
visionaries of modernism in Southern California architecture.</LD>
<LD>   "At a critical time in its beginnings, he brought modern design
within reach of the everyday home-buying public," Patrick Pascal
writes in "Kesling: Modern Structures," an elegant and illuminating
little book that makes the case for Kesling's overlooked genius. "The
scandals have long since been forgotten, but his buildings and the
weight of his influence on modern architecture remain."</LD>
<LD>   Unschooled but gifted, Kesling embraced and perfected the
architectural style known as Streamline Moderne, a style
characterized by horizontal lines, "machine-like" framing and
detailing and the use of materials that were seen in the '30s as
ultra-modern--concrete, stucco, Vitrolite, Carrara glass and baked
porcelain enamel panels. The overall effect, as architectural
historian David Gebhard explains in a useful preface to the book,
"should ideally ... give one the impression of entering a Buck Rogers
rocketship."</LD>
<TE>   Modernism in architecture is the stuff of much theoretical and
even ideological writing, but "Kesling: Modern Structures" allows us
to see what Streamline Moderne looks like in the real world.
Generously illustrated with black-and-white photographs by David
Sadofski and Julius Shulman (a master photographer who has earned his
own place in the pantheon of modern architecture), the book is, among
other things, a gallery of evocative images that remind us that
Southern California has always sought out the shock of the new.</TE>
<TE>   Kesling's personal saga is even more compelling. Born to a German
immigrant couple with a stubborn entrepreneurial impulse--his father
died when he accidentally fell off a cliff while prospecting for gold
in the Anza-Borrego Desert in 1928--Kesling apprenticed as a
carpenter but soon reinvented himself as a designer and contractor
and opened an office in Silver Lake under the company title of
Kesling Modern Structures.</TE>
<TE>   Kesling, sporting a pencil mustache and a combed-back hairstyle
that emphasized his resemblance to Ronald Coleman, courted the "film
colony" for his early commissions; actor Wallace Beery was among his
first and most ardent clients. In 1935, Kesling--"far and away Los
Angeles' most prolific and successful practitioner of Streamline
Moderne design," Pascal writes--broke ground on more than 20
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Overcommitted and underfunded, Kesling found himself under attack
by a few of his own disappointed clients, who accused him of
"cheating poor, defenseless people." Harried by the police and the
grand jury and facing the threat of criminal prosecution against his
wife, Kesling pleaded guilty to one count of fraud involving the sum
of $24: The judge sentenced him to San Quentin but then suspended the
sentence on the condition that he stop designing and building houses.</TE>
<TE>   Kesling reinvented himself yet again when his probation ended in
1939, retreating to La Jolla and re-opening Kesling Modern
Structures. During World War II, he turned to designing and building
prefabricated housing for the aircraft workers who were flocking to
San Diego. Later, he developed a residential neighborhood in the Mira
Mesa district of San Diego; one can stand at the corner of Kesling
Court and Kesling Street in the subdivision that he built.</TE>
<TE>   But Kesling crashed and burned a second time, thanks to the old
curse of too much work and too little time or money and to what
Pascal vaguely characterizes as Kesling's "unethical actions" in
coping with the stress. By 1962, then in his 60s, Kesling was reduced
to making a meager living as a handyman and carpenter, and he died in
1983 of Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "The real tragedy of this episode was not Kesling's but that of
Los Angeles itself," writes Pascal, whose book succeeds in its goal
of rescuing Kesling from obscurity and polishing his tarnished
reputation. "Kesling's scandal allowed the architectural
establishment to look down at this uneducated interloper and hold him
up as an example of the dangers of not hiring professional architects
with proper credentials. Despite leaving his wide and distinctive
mark on the modern design landscape of Los Angeles, it was as if
William Kesling never existed."</TE>
<TE>   If Shulman is regarded as the dean of architectural photographers
in Southern California, the late Morley Baer (1916-1955) held the
same title in Northern California, and "California Plain" allows us
to understand why. Here are 68 black-and-white prints, each depicting
a ramshackle farm structure and each reproduced with the precision
and punch of a fine art photograph.</TE>
<TE>   The structures that are documented in "California Plain" are
purely utilitarian, and they survive as artifacts of a crucial era in
California history. "A barn can be viewed as a 'historical text' ...
that records how the land was transformed," Bright Eastman explains
in an essay in the book titled "Remembering Barns." And, in a sense,
Baer's mostly unsentimental and unadorned photographs help us to see
the subtext of the rural architecture that he photographed; they
conjure up ghosts from an era when as, Eastman puts it, "the tillers
of the soil were ennobled for 'civilizing' the wild land as the
American way of life moved West."</TE>
<TE>   But Baer was far more than an architectural photographer, and the
best of his work may remind the reader of the sublime images that can
be found in Edward Weston's and Charis Wilson's masterpiece,
"California and the West." Indeed, Weston was one of Baer's mentors,
as we learn in a short memoir provided by Baer's last assistant, Paul
Jablonski. Weston once invited Baer to a costume party at his cottage
on Wildcat Hill in Carmel and, as Jablonski tells it, and the young
photographer promptly volunteered to serve as his assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Weston, a notorious womanizer, "you're the wrong sex."</TE>
<TE>   Baer's lofty reputation as a photographer is amply justified by
the images that are so handsomely displayed in "California Plain."
Whether Baer was seeking to show the scale of a humble ranch set
against the monumental upthrust of the Sierra Nevada--as in a
literally dizzying photograph titled "Corral at Mt. Laurel, Owens
Valley"--or the slightly surrealistic detail of a wind-blown barn in
a photograph titled "Skyscraper Barn, Plenbrook," he displays a
command of both camera and subject that elevates his work from photo
documentation to high art.</TE>

<LD>SWAN ELECTRIC</LD>
<LD>   Poems</LD>
<LD>   By April Bernard</LD>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 88 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   April Bernard's new book, "Swan Electric," is juiced up but runs
ultimately on a current of sweet melancholy. The swan is a
time-honored literary symbol, plugged in and re-powered here like an
electric company's neon sign.</TE>
<TE>   The first section of the book offers an impressive array of
sonnets that the author calls disheveled, but they are rather finely
groomed: lyrical, colloquial, original. The sonnets set the tone for
the entire book. We are in the hands of a poet-sophisticate but also
(as Dickinson had it) an inebriate of air. From her sonnet "See It
Does Rise":</TE>
<TE>   Straight from my sun the light shoots up,</TE>
<TE>   through my hair, ecstatic, and on to the place</TE>
<TE>   of iced light and sharp cider, the taste of apples</TE>
<TE>   pressed free, done with the bark and the bees</TE>
<TE>   and the barrels: the clear golden blood you can pour</TE>
<TE>   on your tongue or on the ground, it has risen past care</TE>
<TE>   This Donne-ish aria to apple juice is but one voice in a
startlingly versatile chorus. Tone shifts demonstrate her range:</TE>
<TE>   So I was sitting in the bathtub</TE>
<TE>   reading 'Eichmann in Jerusalem.'</TE>
<TE>   The water was cold compared</TE>
<TE>   with the day ...</TE>
<TE>   or:</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but I've been looking</TE>
<TE>   for a narrative in which suffering makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   to:</TE>
<TE>   I rustled about in the copse of fools:</TE>
<TE>   Why does the Wampeer, glamour aside, yet reign?</TE>
<TE>   If occasionally glib, the poems balance themselves on a beam of
unflinching insight. Take them seriously and lightly. "Swan Electric"
is a combination of Las Vegas, the Lower East Side and Lorca.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LATE WORLD</TE>
<TE>   Poems</TE>
<TE>   By Arthur Smith</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie-Mellon Press:</TE>
<TE>   72 pp., $12.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Smith is one of the best poets around and also one of the
most neglected. In this age of poet self-promotion, he has not
primped up or pandered his wares--his voice has always been quiet,
steady, sure of itself. Grief runs through nearly every Smith line:</TE>
<TE>   It's like</TE>
<TE>   Going to bed at night--you can't</TE>
<TE>   Help it--when someone you love dies,</TE>
<TE>   You go there too.</TE>
<TE>   But his spirit in these poems is so vigorous and graceful (and
gently witty) that the particular and universal presence of death
cannot overshadow the work.</TE>
<TE>   Until the sharp heart gives way to whatever's</TE>
<TE>   Harder than the human head</TE>
<TE>   And its unrelenting grain.</TE>
<TE>   Irony (not the facile variety) informs this poet's
self-deprecating moments. It is a fine irony, born of seeing the
heart through every hard experience yet somehow staying in love with
the world. Read "The Late World" and see how the elegy can be turned
into a song of praise and gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPRINGING</TE>
<TE>   New and Selected Poems</TE>
<TE>   By Marie Ponsot</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 238 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Like Carolyn Kizer, Ruth Stone and Mona Van Duyn, we are looking
at, in Marie Ponsot, a powerful elder stateswoman of verse.</TE>
<TE>   Ponsot has been around for a long time, cultivating a vineyard all
her own. These grapes are grown dry and tart, no light effervescence
here, rather a tawny, backlighted munificence is distilled in poem
after poem. From "St.-Germain-des-Pres: Summer 1948":</TE>
<TE>   Crooked like all our ideas of ancient ascension</TE>
<TE>   The abbey tower topples a little toward us in the haze,</TE>
<TE>   Looking lightning-struck atop the quiet afternoon</TE>
<TE>   Her use of form is elegant and sure-footed, but there is something
slow-ripening, something unhurried about her style. This kind of
leisurely, faintly imperious manner can grow occasionally flat--and
there are perhaps too many poems in this book--it might have been
edited a bit more judiciously. But for the reader willing to spend
time living within the slow-aging perfecting process of the Ponsot
years, there are enormous rewards. Her words seem to rise on a swell
of natural buoyancy and tonal pleasure:</TE>
<TE>   In a skiff on a sunrisen lake we are watchers.</TE>
<TE>   Swimming aimlessly is luxury, just as walking</TE>
<TE>   Loudly up a shallow stream is.</TE>
<TE>   As we lean over the deep well, we whisper.</TE>

<HD>Collateral Damage</HD>
<DH>Photographer Philip Jones Griffiths reflects on the lessons
of Vietnam</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA EMERSON</AU>
<BD>Gloria Emerson received the 1978 National Book Award
for nonfiction for "Winners and Losers: Battles, Retreats, Gains,
Losses and Ruins From the Vietnam War." She is the author, most
recently, of "Loving Graham Greene: A Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In war, words buckle, shrivel or pale as the journalist struggles to
describe an attack, and what it does, until the language seems dry
and flat. This is not the case with the gifted photographer, who must
creep closer to see and forever ratify a scene of suffering by
showing the damage done, the unspeakable harm, the shock of being
hurt. In a new edition of "Vietnam Inc.," the 1971 work of Magnum
photographer Philip Jones Griffiths that has been out of print for
years, there are photographs that are so famous they couldn't belong
to another war. They are horrifying, and yet it is cause for
celebration to have "Vietnam Inc." again, for there is no other book
quite like it.</LD>
<LD>   Oddly enough, the photographer's favorite picture is a mocking and
humorous scene from the old war, the only photograph that makes Jones
Griffiths chortle. It shows a Marine demonstrating how to wash a
child as he scrubs a wretched little boy standing in a basin. A group
of Vietnamese women, whose presence is surely obligatory, are not
impressed or the least bit interested. As Jones Griffiths notes in
one of his acerbic captions, the basin belonged to one of the women,
who claimed it with some indignation. She used it for vegetables. The
women of Vietnam were always hard to pacify.</LD>
<TE>   I remember Jones Griffiths from Saigon, from helicopters, from
this grim place or that. The rest of the press corps seemed rackety
in comparison with this quiet and very watchful man. We met for lunch
in his apartment on West 36th Street in New York, where he has his
darkroom and office. Recovering from major surgery, he is an amiable
host, padding around in bare feet. He is happy to see "Vietnam Inc."
back in print in this country and in Europe. He calls the war in
Vietnam "it" and believes we need reminding of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that America is busy repeating it. American foreign
policy has always neglected the feelings and rights of the local
population," he said. "Vietnam forecast the major attempt of America
to subvert one culture and supplant it with their own."</TE>
<TE>   Fanny, his 20-year-old daughter, races out for Japanese food for
our lunch, and the living room table has to be cleared. He talks a
little about the picture of the washbasin and remembers the places
where he took so many pictures in this book.</TE>
<TE>   In an excellent foreword to the new edition, Noam Chomsky reminds
the reader that the publication of "Vietnam Inc." coincided with the
release of the secret history of U.S. decision-making in Vietnam,
known as the Pentagon Papers.</TE>
<TE>   It is the last photograph in the book that once upset people the
most deeply. It shows the lunatic disorder imposed on a people who so
valued harmony. We see a white-haired old man, barefoot and shackled
to the bed, who seems to be remembering past days. There is a great
sweetness and sadness in his face. The photograph was taken in an
"asylum" near Tan Son Nhut airport in Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked more intelligent and dignified than most of the
Americans," the photographer said. Not every photographer was quite
as alert to the suffering of the Vietnamese people, and this is what
sets Jones Griffiths apart.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in north Wales and a Welsh speaker, the
photographer studied in Liverpool to be a pharmacist and worked at a
Boots the Chemists shop in London. But there was boredom in counting
pills, and he eventually bolted. He started taking pictures at 16
with an Agiflex camera. He first went to Vietnam in mid-1966, staying
for two years, and was back again in 1970 for another year. He could
not have known it right away, but Vietnam is the country that has
claimed him. He has been back at least 20 times since 1975 when the
war ended with the American defeat, usually to take pictures. He will
go back again this fall and looked happy at the thought.</TE>

<HD>Creatures of Love</HD>
<DH>THE TRUTH ABOUT BABIES, By Ian Sansom, Granta Books: 338
pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT FAGGEN</AU>
<BD>Robert Faggen is the editor of "The Cambridge Companion
to Robert Frost." He is a professor of literature at Claremont
McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Truth About Babies" does not, fortunately, deliver what its
title threatens: a polemical tell-all or, worse, a cute self-help
book for new parents. Ian Sansom, who lives in Northern Ireland, is
the father of three young children, and he presents himself, in the
best sense of the word, as an amateur, trying to grasp the phantom of
babyhood and parenthood.</LD>
<LD>   For those who have waded through shelves of works by psychologists
and pediatricians and would like a profoundly funny and wise book on
the subject, "The Truth About Babies" is one of the most interesting
and literate meditations available. Sansom has arranged his
reflections alphabetically, and the ABC format, apposite for its
subject, works well as a diary and as something of a parody of advice
books. Its first entry is "Advice," the last is "Zero," and, indeed,
there is none of the former in its more than 300 pages.</LD>
<LD>   Sansom isn't providing the truth about babies, if what is to be
expected by that phrase is the posture of setting the record straight
against the blather of cliches and rhetoric. If there is any truth,
it is often between Sansom's fine-hammered observations, and he hides
well what he advertises. In the entry on "Lies," for example, he
begins, "No one tells the truth about babies." Through contradiction
and paradox, Sansom does not so much tell the truth as he circles it.</LD>
<TE>   "There are only two kinds of useful books about babies," Sansom
declares, "textbooks and [books of] poems." Far from a textbook, all
of Sansom's own meditations are really poems, often addressed to his
own baby, in which witty and thoughtfully focused observations become
wonderful feats of association. Sansom often reflects on the
suitability of the book's somewhat unpredictable drift to its
subject: "With babies, there's no time for fooling around with
narratives, with niceties like beginnings and middles and end. You
have no plot. You're pure story. You defy the stylistic conventions."
He speaks here to his audience as well as to and about himself and
his baby.</TE>
<TE>   Despite protestations of melancholic disarray, Sansom reveals that
a careful disorderliness may be the truest method for such a book.
Each entry is usually a well-crafted combination of aphorism,
quotation and counter-aphorism. No topic is ever quite resolved, and
his thinking about each takes us in quirky and pleasantly surprising
directions. Sansom avoids for-sale emotions with sophistication and
irony. The entry on "Irony" concludes: "I find myself becoming
increasingly sincere. I find myself becoming the victim of my own
genuine feelings." Though each entry stands on its own, it does not
complete thought but spurs further thinking. Sansom's silences invite
the reader to laugh, to argue and to comment. Though Sansom
apologizes at the beginning for not being able to write a grand,
coherent narrative, his style and form work wonders on the bewildered
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Each entry, however, does form part of a whole and resonates with
many others. Though far from contrived, the book nevertheless
benefits from being read as a poetic narrative. The themes of shock,
memory and mortality coruscate throughout. The entries "Meconium,"
"Memory," "Milestones" and "Milk" follow each other and, in
mysterious ways, reveal the fascinating regions and associations of a
parent's mind as he confronts an infant whom he regards with wonder,
confusion and love.</TE>
<TE>   Sansom intersperses his observations with quotations from his vast
and eclectic reading, ranging from Mary Douglas, Benjamin Spock and
the Police to Ludwig Wittgenstein, Theodor Adorno, Hubbie Ledbetter,
Sigmund Freud and Ginger Rogers. His reading isn't for show, and you
won't find the quotations in an anthology, including erudite
histories of swaddling and medical books. We can imagine Sansom in
the wee hours of the morning frantically absorbing everything he can
get his hands on to help him make sense of a world turned upside
down. The book has a rich and compact texture and becomes a carnival
of baby literature.</TE>
<TE>   In the entry "Fathers," he offers a typically clear and elegantly
written passage on fatherhood from Bertrand Russell's
"Autobiography," which concludes: "All this I experienced, and for
some years it filled my life with happiness and peace." Sansom
follows this quotation with one from Katherine Tait's "My Father
Bertrand Russell": "He played at being a father ... and he acted the
part to perfection, but his heart was elsewhere and his combination
of inner detachment and outer affection caused me much muddled
suffering." Sansom does not leave the irony there, and more and
interesting observations follow. Each observation, dark saying or bit
of wisdom is poised precariously, to be undermined by what follows or
to contradict something said before. Yet each entry has a focus of
concerns making multiple readings fresh and rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   Some entries consist of superb one-liners. "Toys," for example,
contains only the following: "You have to discard the toy in order to
get at the box and the shiny paper." Here Sansom observes his baby
and imagines its consciousness. At times, Sansom can sound as
intriguing and profound as Heraclitus; at other times he appears as a
Chaplinesque figure, hilariously caught in the cogs of a big,
incomprehensible machine.</TE>
<TE>   American readers may find interesting contrasts between their own
and Sansom's experience in Northern Ireland. "Life with a baby
becomes more melodramatic, more full of pathos. It's like living in
America. Actually, Americans are very good with babies." He rarely
presses universal assessments too far, and the reader feels invited
into an ongoing conversation.</TE>
<TE>   As often as Sansom can be droll, he is also saturnine. He hints
not only at the joy of babies and parenting but also at his sadness
and fear. Infants remain a mystery to Sansom as they tease out his
sense of limitation and the fine line between life and death.</TE>
<TE>   In the introduction, he writes, "When you think of beginnings you
soon get to thinking about immortality." That theme resurfaces
throughout the book with varying registers of humor including one
directed at his baby's enigma: "Whatever we might say about you is
only similar to what we say about life after death." The
relationships of shock, memory and knowledge are explored, but in no
systematic way.</TE>
<TE>   Sansom's credibility derives from the fact that he is a
stay-at-home father who spends a great deal of time taking care of
his babies. The demands made on a parent become one of the obstacles
to reflecting about babies and parenthood: "And no one writes when
they're tired. This is why there are virtually no good books about
babies. Or shiftwork." Sansom's entries may seem odd and surprising
but are not without their own kind of dream-logic. As it may have
been pieced together in moments of sleepless delirium, it is also
well-suited to being read at 3 a.m. with the expectation that one
might be allowed a few moments of concentrated thought.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a strong sense of the nightmarish aspects of parenting--"I
know no privacy except in my head" or "I tell myself I am not really
a parent. I'm only doing this for the time being. Until something
else turns up"--Sansom depicts the developing relationship of parent
and baby as a fascinating odyssey that takes us deeply, if
helplessly, into the mystery of existence.</TE>

<HD>Ghost in the Machine</HD>
<DH>MIND CATCHER: By John Darnton, Dutton: 390 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What really scares us about science and technology isn't that they
will be perverted by mad researchers or abused by dictators. It's
that their progress is unstoppable, irreversible. Whatever people can
do, they will do--even, as in the movie "The Matrix," inventing the
machines that will enslave us.</LD>
<LD>   John Darnton taps into that fear in his latest "science adventure"
thriller, "Mind Catcher." In one of its subplots, young computer
experts accept such a future as a given and try to put a positive,
evolutionary spin on it. "Computers will exceed human intelligence by
2020.... Man and machine will link up and evolve together. This is
inevitable once machines replicate themselves. And so the only answer
for humankind is to figure out a way to enter into that system of
evolution. If we don't, we'll be left behind."</LD>
<LD>   Far simpler, it would seem, to strangle the new machines in their
silicon cradles, but nobody is going to do that. Yet passivity and
despair aren't what thrillers are about. Darnton, a veteran New York
Times reporter whose previous novels are "Neanderthal" and "The
Experiment," eventually lets us off the hook in the interests of
drama. He focuses on the lesser danger: an individual, evil doctor,
named, appropriately, Warren Cleaver.</LD>
<TE>   Cleaver is in charge of a rundown mental hospital on one of New
York City's islands, a refuse bin for patients nobody cares about any
longer. Thus he's free to experiment on them. His interest is in the
moment of death.</TE>
<TE>   Loved ones far away sometimes report visitations from the dying
person. Does the mind, then, escape the confines of the brain? Can
this free-floating spirit--known traditionally as the soul--be
tracked, captured, hooked up to a computer? Can it be controlled? In
the dedication to this novel, Darnton notes that his father was
killed in New Guinea during World War II and that his mother "said
she knew of his death the moment it occurred." Characters in "Mind
Catcher" have similar experiences. Tyler Jessup, a 13-year-old boy
whose injury in a rock-climbing accident gives Cleaver the chance to
try out his theories, "saw" his mother when she died in a plane
crash. Dr. Kate Willet, who helps renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Leopoldo
Saramaggio operate on Tyler, heard her mother describe "seeing" her
father when he was killed in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler is rushed to New York with a climbing tool sunk deep in his
brain. Saramaggio views the operation as his ticket to lasting fame,
just as pioneering heart transplants were for Dr. Christiaan Barnard.
He plans to repair the damage to Tyler's brain by extracting stem
cells, growing them in a laboratory and reinserting them. Meanwhile,
in case the boy falters, the involuntary functions of his brain will
be kept going by Cleaver's computers.</TE>
<TE>   Saramaggio is an egotist and a showboater, but not truly bad.
Cleaver is another matter, willing to sacrifice anyone in the
supposed interests of science (Willet takes a first look at him and
thinks of Lenin). His own, secret plan for the computers is to suck
out the contents of Tyler's mind, whether the boy survives physically
or not.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting for Tyler's life, and later for his death with dignity,
is his father, Scott, a photographer. His struggle is joined by
Willet, who is dismayed by the godlike pretensions of her colleagues.
The two fall in love and are just coming to terms with grief--Tyler,
they are sure, is dead and buried--when Scott's computer screen
lights up with messages about things that only he and his son,
exceptionally close, could know.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this is when the novel runs thin--at the point
where reportage must give way to imagination. Darnton is a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist; as we would expect, "Mind Catcher" is
exhaustively researched. Brain surgery, stem cells, acute mental
illnesses, cyber culture, Tyler's climb, Scott's photography--all are
described in detail. But the people are fairly stock thriller
characters, and the journey into the unknown--wherever Tyler's mind
has gone--could be imagined more vividly and interestingly by any
Hollywood special-effects shop, and no doubt will.</TE>

<HD>The World According to Blass</HD>
<DH>BARE BLASS: By Bill Blass, Edited by Cathy Horyn,
HarperCollins: 184 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WOODY HOCHSWENDER</AU>
<BD>Woody Hochswender is coauthor of "The Buddha in Your
Mirror." He is a former style reporter for the New York Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fashion designer Bill Blass had a way of expressing himself--hale
and hearty yet wickedly, breathtakingly frank--that seemed to be
custom-made for print. For years, people in the fashion field urged
him to write a book. The result, a slender volume finished shortly
before his death in June, is "Bare Blass," edited by Cathy Horyn,
fashion critic for the New York Times.</LD>
<LD>   It's a miniskirt of a memoir--skimpy but revealing. At 184 pages,
including 91 photographs, "Bare Blass" is barely there.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, it's eerily, unmistakably, irresistibly pure Blass. It's
the voice, you see: that cultured baritone, the gentlemanly hauteur,
the self-reductive irony. There was a degree of humbug to Blass--but
he, at least, recognized it. By turns rambling, incisive, snobbish,
down-home, good-humored and catty, "Bare Blass" is like the man. In a
business that is all surface, he managed to convey a bit of depth.</LD>
<TE>   Before we go any further, I should state that I considered Blass a
friend. I've two-martini-lunched with him. I've sat down to the
famous Blass meatloaf at his big stone house in Connecticut. (I even
discussed his memoirs with him.) This book is not at all what I
expected, but it has its virtues. Number one: The book exists. It's
him talking in a natural, unvarnished way. We now have an oral
history of Blass' life and career--and of a unique time in the
history and development of American fashion. There are priceless
snapshots of American society as it developed in the postwar period,
and as Blass moved to its center, perhaps the first Seventh Avenue
"tradesman" to do so. Prior to Blass, creative people in the garment
industry were relegated to the back room. Blass was among the first
to become a "name," eventually putting his on dozens of licensed
products, from fragrances and hosiery to furniture and automobiles.
But the process and the social climb were arduous and involved the
detailed, nuanced retail courtship--seduction, really--of pockets of
wealthy women all across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There was hardly an American city, or a group of gals, I didn't
know," he writes. And whether in Kansas City or Beverly Hills, Blass
learned a thing or two about tact. As he puts it: "Of course you
can't say to a woman stepping out of a fitting room, her face beaming
with hope, 'Oh, my God, that makes you look fat.' But you can say,
'Kid, that's not you. Let's try something else.' " Words for husbands
and lovers everywhere to remember eternally.</TE>
<TE>   The book is peopled with plenty of rich, long-necked women--the
Babe Paleys, Pat Buckleys, Mica Erteguns, Nancy Kissingers whom Blass
charmed and dressed--with some of the fitting-room titti-poo and
ballroom twaddle that comes with that territory.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Blass' women and men friends contribute little
sidebar-type quotations throughout the text. Some of these are
revealing. Others involve the carefully crafted in-group flattery
that reminds us that in the upper echelons of New York society,
mutual admiration is an iron law for both entree and continued
membership.</TE>
<TE>   Like real conversation, the narrative tends to meander back and
forth across time, change focus in midstream, digress wildly, and
then circle back on itself, rather as if Blass were holding forth
into a tape recorder while patting his dog (which is probably just as
it was). It is not a conventional autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   "Childhood bores the hell out of me," he tells us in the first
sentence, and he pretty much skips his Indiana boyhood, occasionally
doubling back to Fort Wayne to discuss the suicide of his father, a
hardware salesman. Like countless others, Blass escaped from
Midwestern "joylessness" and, as a teenager, succumbed permanently to
the allure of New York, freely admitting, "how naive and susceptible
to glamour I was." Along the way he somehow acquired a Park Avenue
accent and an unswerving sense of himself as both paragon and
instrument of American style.</TE>
<TE>   We don't get quite how that magical metamorphosis happens to
provincial guys like Blass or Halston or even Cole Porter--the
transformative moments when they discover this inner confidence that
makes them feel they can dictate and pontificate on the art of
living--but never mind. His description of Diana Vreeland, the
legendary Vogue editor, could just as easily refer to Blass himself:
"She combined Twain's reverence for the reinvented self with Barnum's
love of showmanship, and she spent her life perfecting this blend." A
kind of sadness can exist at the core of such lifelong masquerades
(poignantly depicted in the one-woman show, "Full Gallop," about
Vreeland). Though he admits to one or two love affairs, Blass pretty
much lived life alone, with his dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears women, especially the man-killer types like
Slim Keith (the model for the Lauren Bacall character in "To Have and
Have Not") had a weakness for him, his own weakness seems to have
been for men. But when it comes to his romantic life, he tends to
blow a bit of smoke. "[T]o have lived in a long-term relationship
with a man would have been to categorize myself too narrowly," he
says. "Because, in so many cases, I've been attracted to women. To
the romance part plus the acceptance of a hetero relationship--that
being the most natural way, in my opinion, to live one's life."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm. That doesn't sound quite right. To a lot of people, including
me, Blass had about the best straight act in the business.</TE>
<TE>   But it certainly was a class act. He was neither a hothouse flower
like Yves Saint Laurent, nor a leather-bar type like some
contemporary designers. He was a product of his times, especially his
World War II experience, obviously a vivid and formative one, as a
member of the top-secret 603rd Camouflage Battalion, which was
involved in the Battle of the Bulge.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Blass fashioned himself as strictly a Stork Club
gent. Husky, hard-drinking, masculine to the bone. He writes: "It
wasn't that I hated the fag elements of fashion; it was that I hated
the limits that fashion imposed.... I chose to set myself apart,
consciously or unconsciously."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a lot of other self-made men, Bill Blass never came on like
a stuffed shirt and was surprisingly good company. His memoir, which
can be knocked off in an afternoon, is pretty good company, too.</TE>

<LD>When Lingua Franca, a plucky review of academic life, abruptly ceased
publication in 2001, its readers were left stranded, but who else
noticed? Los Angeles may have a book festival and New York may be
book country, but few citizens read periodicals devoted to cultural
and intellectual matters. Americans, who routinely fork over 30 bucks
for a month of television, just as routinely resist paying even a
part of that for a year's subscription to a serious magazine. The
numbers reflect the dollars. Television programs get bumped if they
draw only millions of viewers. But cultural magazines partake of
another world.</LD>
<LD>   A basic category in the National Magazine Awards is for
periodicals with circulation "under 200,000." The term "under" should
be emphasized. Many serious periodicals have circulations under
25,000. I used to write for a magazine whose circulation was 1,200.
We joked that an American city of 200,000 people might have one
subscriber; Chicago's readers could gather for a meal.</LD>
<TE>   Yet small (if not beautiful) may be important. Small magazines
play big roles. Their impact cannot be measured in numbers. No one
would calculate the significance of the 1930s Partisan Review by its
circulation figures; the same could be said of earlier journals like
the Lively Arts or the Masses. Such magazines are passed around; they
are commented upon. They serve as places for authors to try out ideas
and for readers to find new writers. Invisible on the surface, the
small journals are the intellectual arteries of the body politic.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Lingua Franca. In 1990 a former professor of French
literature at Yale, Jeffrey Kittay, had the inspired idea to put out
a "review of academic life." The academic establishment supports, of
course, many professional magazines and one plump weekly newspaper,
the Chronicle of Higher Education, directed mainly to administrators.
Kittay realized these periodicals omitted the snap and crackle of
academic life: the gossip, the lawsuits, the academic stars and their
critics, the trends and counter-trends. He sought to publish a smart
and brash journal that would capture the campus sizzle.</TE>
<TE>   In "Quick Studies," Alexander Star, the editor of Lingua Franca
for six of its 11 years, has assembled a representative sampling for
the millions of Americans who never subscribed or saw a copy, since
the journal never broke the 15,000 circulation barrier. He notes in
his introduction that the time was ripe for an irreverent academic
journal. Campuses were riven by arguments about the "cultural wars,"
political correctness, speech codes, multiculturalism, affirmative
action, postmodernism and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Lingua Franca came out fighting with well-written forays that
frequently stepped on toes or, at least, raised eyebrows, most
famously with the brilliant hoax by Alan Sokal, a New York University
physicist. When the opaque pretentiousness of humanist academics
irritated the straight-shooting Sokal, he submitted to a cutting-edge
cultural studies journal an article of patent nonsense, dense but
filled with fashionable references and phrases. Social Text, and its
theoretical bigwigs, took the bait and published the piece--titled
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics
of Quantum Gravity"--only to be stunned by the next issue of Lingua
Franca, in which Sokal confessed he had hoodwinked the editors.</TE>
<TE>   The Sokal brouhaha brought to the fore disputes about recent turns
in humanist disciplines, mainly the rise of postmodernism and
cultural studies, to which Star devotes the first section of this
collection. He includes the pathetic response by the editors of
Social Text, as well as another confession, of an "ex-literary
critic" who admits that the arid prose and rote politics served up by
literary theorists (including himself) killed his love of literature.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the pieces review the jargon of the new academics. To
be sure, the phenomenon of English professors who cannot write
English is not new, but it has been elevated into a militant program
by cultural studies exponents. Its leading figures often appeal to
German philosophy to justify their inability to link subject, verb
and object; they maintain that the language of humanism must be
ungainly to be deep. Lucidity equals superficiality.</TE>
<TE>   Star includes an angry letter by Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley
professor of rhetoric, who had been awarded first prize in a "worst
writing " contest. Butler accuses Lingua Franca of cheap and tawdry
journalism. Jim Miller, a New School dean, explores the issues in an
essay that is almost too magnanimous, "Is Bad Writing Necessary?" The
question can be answered simply: No. But this is not to say good
writing must be simple-minded.</TE>
<TE>   Lingua Franca ranged far and wide; it took up everything from the
troubled relationship between Milan Kundera and his translators to
academics as court witnesses and the mysterious murder of a
University of Chicago professor. For its readers, every issue offered
goodies: news about books and academic life, often featuring a
central profile.</TE>
<TE>   Star signals a long essay on Jane Gallop as a Lingua Franca model.
Gallop, a feminist professor, was accused of sexual harassment by
several female students. Like the other piece in this collection on
sexual harassment, the article borders on the surreal. Gallop's
decision not to write a letter of recommendation caused a student to
lodge a complaint of harassment. In the lingo of "sexual harassment,"
Gallop's refusal demonstrated an intolerable "power differential."
The university seriously investigated the charge, although it was
finally dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Though Lingua Franca's profiles were frequently entertaining, and
sometimes illuminating, Star may have inadvertently played into the
hands of critics who called the journal a People magazine for
professors. Often numbingly detailed, the profiles succeeded each
other even as the ideas receded. One learns, for instance, that
Gallop touched the chair of a student with a bare foot but nothing of
her intellectual contribution, except that she was a "famous"
feminist scholar.</TE>
<TE>   Profiles like these begin to feed off the American obsession with
fame. We revel in details about the famous, the almost famous or the
wannabes, but what are the issues? To be sure, Lingua Franca ran
challenging pieces, for instance an essay on the highly regarded
literary critic Paul de Man who hid his anti-Semitic past. Yet such
pieces became scarcer, and it is perhaps indicative that Star leaves
that article out of this collection.</TE>
<TE>   What killed Lingua Franca? Several explanations might be offered.
For academics, the magazine lacked status. To be published in it
brought no credit inasmuch as it was regarded as lowly journalism. To
be covered by it was a dubious honor, because you could be not only
celebrated but besmirched.</TE>
<TE>   The journal was passed along but few professors wanted to be
caught with their name on the subscription label. Lingua Franca
existed like Playboy among the Boy Scouts, well-circulated and
thumbed but rarely purchased. Moreover, probably as a response to
Lingua Franca, the Chronicle of Higher Education added more cultural
and intellectual coverage, as did the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Lingua Franca exposed the open secret about small
journals of culture and opinion in contemporary America. For all
their repute, with one or two exceptions, they do not make a cent.</TE>
<TE>   The New Republics, Harper's, the Nations, and, of course, the
Lingua Francas require dedicated souls with deep pockets to pay their
bills. After 11 years, a backer of Lingua Franca decided enough was
enough and pulled out. Nearly 280 million Americans did not notice,
but some of us mourned its demise.</TE>

<HD>The Mystery of Jean Moulin</HD>
<DH>RESISTANCE AND BETRAYAL: The Death and Life of the Greatest
Hero of the French Resistance, By Patrick Marnham, Random House: 296
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Douglas Johnson is the author of "France and the
Dreyfus Affair" and other books and is emeritus professor of French
history at the University of London.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean Moulin has been called the greatest hero of the French
Resistance. But it was 21 years after his death in German hands and
20 years after the liberation of Paris that he was so proclaimed. And
the proclamation itself was very unusual. It was more like a
canonization.</LD>
<LD>   On the morning of Dec. 19, 1964, a large gathering assembled
outside the Pantheon in Paris, the deconsecrated church that is the
resting place of the heroes of the French Republic. A remarkable
ceremony was presided over by President Charles de Gaulle, who was
wearing his legendary uniform, that of the two-star general who
founded La France Libre in London. Before the coffin containing the
supposed remains of Moulin (it is not known where or how he died )
was taken into the building, the crowd heard a remarkable speech by
writer Andre Malraux, in which he hailed the Resistance as the people
of the night, and Moulin as their leader.</LD>
<LD>   "Think of his poor, battered face," he cried. "That day, his last
day, it was the face of France."</LD>
<TE>   Thus began the cult of Moulin. Until this ceremony, his name was
largely unknown. There had been commemorations in places that had had
a particular involvement with him, such as Beziers, in the south,
where he was born in 1899, and Chartres, where he had lived as
prefect of the Eure-et-Loire department. But those who had died
fighting in the Resistance had often been honored in localities where
they were known, so there was nothing special about this. Books about
the Resistance, published before 1964, had scarcely mentioned him or
had referred to him by his Resistance pseudonym as "Max."</TE>
<TE>   But after the Pantheon ceremony, books about him became plentiful.
In 1993, it was estimated that nearly a thousand streets, squares and
bridges had adopted the name of Jean Moulin, as had several lycees
and universities. In this category of fame and honor, Moulin stood
high, outclassed only by de Gaulle and Gen. Jacques Leclerc.</TE>
<TE>   But why had de Gaulle ordered this commemoration? It was assumed
that he had a particular motive. The spectacle, with the Pantheon as
its background, reminded the country that, if Moulin was the leader
of the people of the night, de Gaulle was the Liberator of France.
And if he was to be a candidate for reelection as president in 1965,
then the man who had recently abandoned Algeria needed the victories
and the glory of the past. It is noticeable that when de Gaulle
concluded the final Cabinet meeting of the year, on Dec. 23, 1964, he
told his ministers that they could look back on a successful 12
months, culminating in the commemoration of Moulin.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, this maneuver inflamed many former members of the
Resistance and encouraged them not only to question the timing of the
ceremony, but also to ask whether Moulin had really been the leader
of the Resistance. Had the right man been placed in the Pantheon? As
Moulin became a cult figure, he also became a figure of bitter
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   But what sort of a man was Moulin? This is the question that
Patrick Marnham addresses in what is a relatively short book (given
the length of many books about Moulin), and a book that is always
direct in its presentation and argument.</TE>
<TE>   In chapters describing Moulin's life up to the French army's
defeat in June 1940, when he was on the eve of his 41st birthday,
there are certain aspects that Marnham stresses. One is what his
sister, Laure Moulin, loyally called his natural sense of reserve,
but which was usually called his secrecy. Another is his ambition. A
French historian of the Resistance has said, with a certain delicacy,
that you do not become the youngest sub-prefect in France, and then
the youngest prefect, which was Moulin's achievement, simply by being
a talented administrator. One of Moulin's acquaintances is quoted as
saying that, as young men, they were all ambitious, but if you saw
Moulin talking to a friend, he looked as if he were plotting
something against himself. He appears as if he were always watchful
for the right opportunity, manipulative, becoming a Freemason so that
he could benefit from influential contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Another aspect of Moulin's life, as shown by Marnham, is that he
had difficulties with personal relations. The failure of his marriage
was largely caused by his mother-in-law, who thought that he had
married her young daughter because he knew that she would inherit a
large sum of money on reaching the age of 21. But while he had
several girlfriends and spent enjoyable holidays with people of his
age, the first real friend that we are told about was Pierre Cot,
whom he met in 1925 and who was elected deputy three years later.
They shared many interests, such as sports and dancing, and most
particularly, the politics of the Radical Socialist party.</TE>
<TE>   In all biographies of Moulin, events of June 1940 are of
considerable importance. It was then that, as prefect of the
Eure-et-Loire region, he was in Chartres when the Germans arrived in
the early hours of June 17. The story has often been told. Moulin
refused to sign a document falsely stating that Senegalese troops in
the French army had killed some French women, and the Germans beat
him up. Exhausted, and fearing that he would give way to the Germans
if they continued, when he was left in prison for the night he cut
his throat. But the German guard found him when he was still alive,
and his life was saved. Marnham does not see this as an example of
heroism. He suggests that the imprisoned Moulin waited until he heard
the German guard arriving before carefully cutting himself close to
his chin, so that no major artery was severed although he bled and
the wound appeared dangerous. This was an example of cunning, not
heroism.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that Marnham is, to say the least, critical of Moulin.
And why not? Every hero has his weaknesses. But the general theme of
the book sets out to show that Moulin was tainted by his communist
acquaintances and ideas. From the time that he first became a friend
of Cot's, Moulin was in contact not only with members of the party
but also with Soviet agents. When he left France in September 1941,
on his long journey to join de Gaulle in London, Marnham describes
Moulin as a man far more committed to the defense of the Soviet Union
than to the cause of patriotic resistance. And he finds it
particularly significant that, when working for de Gaulle, Moulin
concealed his contacts with the circle of Soviet agents. Marnham's
fundamental belief is that the communists always sought to seize
power in France.</TE>
<TE>   Moulin's greatest achievement was to create the National Council
of the Resistance, which met for the first time in occupied Paris on
May 27, 1943. This brought together the most important Resistance
groups and representatives of several political parties. This was
also an achievement for the communists. Moulin had done what they
wanted. From then on, they had no further use for Moulin. Indeed, he
hindered them by insisting on his own power, and because he
represented de Gaulle who was the great obstacle to their revolution,
they needed to get rid of him. So, according to Marnham, it was the
communists who betrayed him. On June 21, less than a month after the
first meeting of the National Council, Moulin was seized by the
Gestapo and disappeared for ever.</TE>
<TE>   This is highly controversial. Because the author has written a
most readable narrative but has not presented an historical argument
sustained by evidence, it is far from convincing. His vision of the
communist party as a unified revolutionary force is hardly credible.</TE>
<TE>   His arguments are not helped by hints. Thus, after November 1940,
when Moulin has been dismissed from his prefecture and is on
half-pay, Marnham notes that he does not seem short of money. Someone
must be giving him money. Who could it be? And when, writing about
the exodus of civilians from Chartres in 1940, Moulin said that it
was the "so-called ruling class of the bourgeoisie" that had given
the example. Marnham comments that the phrase is, of course, straight
out of the Marxist night-school handbook. How could he make this
snide remark about a man whom he has praised for his exceptional
ability?</TE>

<DH>IN SEARCH OF AN AMERICAN CATHOLICISM: A History of Religion
and Culture in Tension, By Jay P. Dolan, Oxford University Press: 312
pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES R. MORRIS</AU>
<BD>Charles R. Morris is the author of "American Catholic:
The Saints and Sinners Who Built America's Most Powerful Church."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tension between religion and American culture dates from the
earliest settlements. Although most of the colonies had some form of
established church, religious pluralism was the norm by the early
18th century. A country peopled by the descendants of fugitives
seeking freedom of worship was poor soil for the kind of religious
repression characteristic of the Old World. Still, the commitment to
principled consistency embodied in the Establishment Clause of the
1st Amendment to the Constitution was extraordinary.</LD>
<LD>   Under the constitutional theory of the day, however, the 1st
Amendment did not apply to the states, many of which still legislated
religious discrimination, chiefly against "papists"--the adherents of
the "Romish" church, the "Whore of Babylon" of the Apocalypse. Beyond
sheer prejudice, in fact, there were many reasons why one might
conclude that Catholicism was fundamentally disposed against the
American experiment. The Vatican left no doubt of its preference for
monarchy, fulminating in encyclical after encyclical that freedom of
speech, of the press and of religion was "insanity."</LD>
<TE>   Jay P. Dolan is the author and editor of numerous books on
American Catholic history. Over the last 30 years at Notre Dame
University, he has built the nation's finest archive of source
materials on American Catholicism. His new book, "In Search of an
American Catholicism," is an essay on the ups and downs of the
always-uneasy accommodation between Catholicism and American-style
religious pluralism.</TE>
<TE>   Dolan distinguishes five broad stages of adaptation. From the
revolutionary era through the 1820s, the Catholic population
contained a high proportion of upper-middle-class, educated
individuals imbued with Enlightenment and republican ideals. Despite
the instinctive mistrust of Catholics by Protestant fundamentalists,
Catholicism had actually begun to acquire a certain intellectual
cachet in the early 19th century. The year 1832 marked the first and
only time that a Catholic priest was named chaplain to the U.S.
Congress. Matthew Carey, a university-educated Philadelphia publisher
and pamphleteer who emigrated from Ireland in 1784, and the
remarkable Maryland Carroll family--Charles Carroll was a signer of
the Declaration of Independence--are Dolan's prime exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Virulent anti-Catholicism returned during the antebellum period of
rapid emigration of European peasants and small farmers, especially
from Ireland. To the guardians of order in large cities, Catholic
immigrants appeared to be destructive hordes, their religion a
bizarre form of theater dedicated to extracting money from inert
masses. John Hughes, the fiery archbishop of New York City and the
bete noire of New York intellectuals, created the carapaced,
immigrant-based, ghettoized style of American Catholicism that
persisted until the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   After the Civil War--Dolan's third period--the Hughes brand of
ghetto Catholicism was challenged by an "Americanist" wing of the
U.S. hierarchy, led by Minnesota bishop, John Ireland. The battle
centered on the church's commitment to a separate parochial school
system. Ireland was eventually routed out by the hierarchy's
conservatives, who counterbalanced their distancing of the church
from American culture with a vigorous flag-waving patriotism. By
World War I, the patriotism of Catholics was no longer in question.</TE>
<TE>   That adroit combination of separatism and patriotism was the
platform for the American church's most successful expansionist
period, which extended roughly from the 1920s through John Kennedy's
election as president in 1960. Catholics, and Catholic priests,
defined the progressive but socially conservative style of American
unionism. Powerful big-city bishops were a force in Democratic Party
politics. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen ruled the airwaves. The vigorous
Spencer Tracy stereotype of the Catholic priest became almost a
masculine ideal. Influential Protestant journals lamented that
Catholicism seemed to be taking over the whole country.</TE>
<TE>   Just as it was influencing American culture, the powerful American
Catholic Church was also transmitting American values to world
Catholicism. The final episode in Dolan's tale opens with an account
of how Vatican II, the council of bishops summoned by Pope John XXIII
in 1962, officially endorsed American-style freedom of religion. It
was the sweetest of victories for the American Jesuit John Courtney
Murray, the primary drafter of the canons, who had been firmly
squelched by the Vatican just a decade before for his justifications
of religious toleration.</TE>
<TE>   To Dolan, the attributes of the post-Vatican II American church
that he most admires--the respect for parish democracy, the leading
role of women, the vibrant engagement with American culture--are
finally bringing it back to its true roots, in the Enlightenment and
republican ideals represented by the Careys and Carrolls at the very
outset of the American Catholic experience.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question about Dolan's mastery of his material, but
the book's rigid schematic frame suggests that his material may
sometimes be tailored to fit his argument rather than the other way
around. For example, he points to the resistance to assimilation by
ethnic Polish parishes and their mode of organization (a form of lay
association) as an example of the pervasiveness of the Catholic
democratic impulse.</TE>
<TE>   But the Catholic Poles who emigrated in the late 19th and early
20th centuries came from a world devoid of democratic traditions, and
their pastors, such as Msgr. Vincent Barzynski, the semi-legendary
"Polish bishop" of Chicago, ruled like petty czars. Their
organizational modes were more plausibly a device to keep parish
property out of the reach of the diocesan administrative machinery.
The breakaway Polish National Church of the 1920s also had less to do
with democratic aspirations than with ethnic resentment against the
Germans who controlled the church in most areas of Polish settlement.
In the same vein, although Irish bishops justified their attempts to
break up ethnically organized German parishes in the name of
"Americanization"--and a few may actually have meant it--the
confrontations were really about power and political control.</TE>
<TE>   The more prosaic truth behind the church's shifting patterns of
accommodation to American democratic values may simply be that
middle-and upper-class parishioners demand a say in how their
churches are run. When the American church was primarily concerned
with assimilating unlettered immigrants, pastors and bishops reigned
like minor deities. When the laity is relatively well-educated, as in
the Maryland brand of 18th century Catholicism or as in the last
generation, they take a much stronger role. The same could be said of
almost any religion.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever the ultimate causes, the Americanization of
Catholicism still leaves the burning question that so troubled
conservative prelates in the 19th century: Can the church achieve an
American version of Catholicism without getting swallowed up in the
all-enveloping American culture? The answer to that question is still
very much in doubt, as Dolan acknowledges, and his extended essay is
a compact guide to the twisty accommodations that have evolved over
the last 200 years.</TE>

<DH>EARTHSHAKING SCIENCE: What We Know (and Don't Know) About
Earthquakes, By Susan Elizabeth Hough, Princeton University Press:
238 pp., $24.95 THE LITTLE BOOK OF EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES, By Rolf
Schick, Copernicus Books: 164 pp., $20</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Reich has written about earthquakes and
volcanoes for The Times for 20 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earthquakes and volcanoes command much public attention. They have
caused countless casualties and incalculable damage, and their
dreadful future potential is the subject of very extensive research.
But as Susan Elizabeth Hough in "Earthshaking Science: What We Know
(And Don't Know) About Earthquakes" and Rolf Schick in "The Little
Book of Earthquakes and Volcanoes" note, there are vast gaps in our
knowledge about them and predictions of when they will occur and how
big their manifestations will be remain highly unreliable.</LD>
<LD>   It is refreshing when scientists tell us freely what they don't
know. Hough, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey
in Pasadena, commendably observes in her preface, "We cannot predict
earthquakes; we may never be able to do so." And Schick, a retired
professor of geophysics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany,
concludes his volume by observing, "The most important question for
the population affected by the volcano is whether the increasing
activity will lead to a large and dangerous eruption. This still
cannot be answered by volcanologists."</LD>
<TE>   There are parts of these books that will be beyond the
comprehension of most readers, much technical language and many
unfamiliar terms. But other parts fixate our attention with
appropriately lurid worst-case scenarios of quakes and eruptions.
When we are told that Mt. Rainier in Washington state has loosed
mud-and ash-flows prehistorically that covered the sites of great
cities today, who can restrain his or her imagination, particularly
when, as Hough reminds us, "If there is a single overarching
principle in geology and seismology alike, it is this: The past is
the key to the present, and the future."</TE>
<TE>   If there is reassurance in all this, particularly for
California--the locale of so many earthquakes and, in the north,
volcanoes--it is that worst-case scenarios occur only very
infrequently. The chances are extremely small that any of us will
still be alive the next time a catastrophic eruption takes place like
the one at Mt. Mazama 7,000 years ago, forming Crater Lake in Oregon,
or the next time the Long Valley Caldera at Mammoth Lakes sprays ash,
several meters deep, hundreds of miles away, as it did 760,000 years
ago. Similarly, it is conceivable that the L.A. Basin could have a
quake of magnitude 7.5, eight times greater than the 1994 Northridge
quake. But it hasn't happened in the last several hundred years, at
least, and may be a long time coming.</TE>
<TE>   There is, incidentally, one implicit assumption made by both of
these authors that perhaps should be greeted with some
skepticism--that the theories of plate tectonics that frame much of
our current understanding of earthquakes and volcanoes are fairly
complete and beyond challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Hough devotes considerable space to a tortuous attempt to explain
gigantic temblors, called intraplate quakes, such as the New Madrid
sequence of 1811-12 in the Midwest and South that occurred far from
the plate boundaries. And Schick is compelled to discuss volcanoes,
such as the Hawaiian chain, that lie far from the subduction zones
that are so vital a part of plate tectonics.</TE>
<TE>   Since we are no more at the end of science today than we were a
decade ago at the end of history with the breakup of the Soviet
empire, it is no wild fancy to surmise, as some scientists do, that
tectonic theories will one day have to be much revised.</TE>

<LD>THE UNDERGROUND HEART</LD>
<LD>   A Return to a Hidden Landscape</LD>
<LD>   By Ray Gonzalez</LD>
<TE>   University of Arizona Press:</TE>
<TE>   170 pp., $35</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to understand everything you read. There are many
wonderful moments in literature when an author for a moment loses
sight of his audience. Perhaps only a handful of people will
understand what he is thinking in those moments.</TE>
<TE>   Here is Ray Gonzalez, career memoirist and poet, going back again
to the land where he was born 50 years ago in El Paso: "[S]hooting
down a risky highway where Colorado is saying good-bye, New Mexico is
welcoming me with black rain clouds in magnetic fields, and the
Allman Brothers are in heart-attack mode."</TE>
<TE>   "Home is the generation of longing," he writes, but "The
Underground Heart," his account of life in the Southwest, is more
ironic than nostalgic. Gonzalez is bitter about the rising border
tourism that romanticizes certain aspects (tequila, Pancho Villa)
while ignoring decrepitude and hostility toward immigrants. The
Southwest, he writes, noticing trucks crossing the border with
America's toxic waste, is the most "nuclear-polluted" part of the
country. There is this aspect of the book; then there is the poet,
responding on a cellular level to a biological call to the desert. He
thinks about death and regeneration in the desert and dives far into
his own subconscious, where I can no longer follow him: "[The] desert
delivers reality, then takes it away from the love of family and the
love of history that has grown from the stories of families in the
desert."</TE>
<TE>   These essays give a reader the feeling of walking home in
Gonzalez's footsteps. We can sense the neon light in the desert, the
nuclear waste underneath the ocotillo, but we don't quite know what
that means to him. And that's just fine. Maybe someday we will.</TE>

<TE>   AFTER NATURE</TE>
<TE>   By W.G. Sebald</TE>
<TE>   Random House: 124 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   "Our brains, after all, / are always at work on some quivers / of
self-organization, however faint, / and it is from this that an order
/ arises, in places beautiful / and comforting, though more cruel,
too, than the previous state of ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   These lines, from the autobiographical third prose poem in this
triptych, contain the organizing principle of the three poems in
"After Nature." The first is about the 16th century painter Matthias
Grunewald, the second about the 19th century botanist Georg Steller.
The scientist, the artist and the writer all trying to make sense of
life and death, pulled between images of white snow in the Alps and
green forests and pastures. The late W.G. Sebald is a writer who
often stops, in his quest for meaning, with the unexplained
coincidence. He will not translate that coincidence for his readers,
and this is the secret of his perfect timing. Here is the other
secret: We are willing to be carried along in a haze of not quite
understanding because Sebald also revels in the pure music of words:
"claret," "lungwort," "finial," "Pentecost," "glutinous" and "vapor"
are just a few.</TE>
<TE>   Only by suspending readerly willfulness will you be able to float
weightless through his writing. The reward? "Darkness even at noon
and / luminaries absent from heaven," "Moss roses / grow on the Alps.
Avignon sylvan. / Across the Gotthard a horse gropes its way," "The
potted plants have had a way of / keeping things to themselves,"
"When morning sets in, / the coolness of night / moves out into the
plumage / of fishes." Now, isn't that enough?</TE>

<TE>   THE ART OF SETTING STONES</TE>
<TE>   And Other Writings From the Japanese Garden</TE>
<TE>   By Marc Peter Keane</TE>
<TE>   Stone Bridge Press: 156 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Art of Setting Stones" is an example of a lovely book
hampered by the author's desire to explain too much. One of the
hardest things to hide in literature is self-consciousness; too much
explanation is a symptom of self-consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   These essays describe places in and around Kyoto, Japan, that
inspired Marc Peter Keane. He interprets nature, reveals its
metaphors and meanings explicitly, the way the Japanese do
implicitly. "A flower herself," he writes of a little girl inspecting
lotus flowers in a pond, "a perfect blossom aged four or five. Has
she risen so quickly from the muck? Or, do we all begin as pure, only
to fall at some point, lodge firmly in the mire, and need to work our
way out again?"</TE>
<TE>   Every flower, every tree, every stone, is a jumping-off point for
a similar meditation. "In ancient times," he explains, "all of nature
was perceived as animate ... people of that time were attuned to the
intricacies of nature, able through that intimacy to gain knowledge
pertinent to their lives." Keane's method, rather than re-creating
the nature he admires and finds meaning in for the reader, re-creates
instead his own consciousness. He re-creates the mirror that he looks
into, and it is calm, but flat.</TE>

<HD>Can George Soros Save the World?</HD>
<DH>SOROS: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire, By
Michael T. Kaufman, Alfred A. Knopf: 344 pp., $27.50 ON
GLOBALIZATION, By George Soros, PublicAffairs: 192 pp., $20</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID RIEFF</AU>
<BD>David Rieff is the author of numerous books, including
"A Bed for the Night: Humanitarianism in Crisis." He is a
contributing writer to Book Review and has worked for the Soros
foundations over the years and sits on the board of their Central
Asian initiative.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can democracy be fostered, or even created, by undemocratic means?
Does it matter if the institution doing this fostering is the
creation and extension of one very rich person who need not stand for
office, take into account the wishes of an electorate or indeed
consult anyone or anything except his bankers, his conscience, and
experts to whom he may listen to or not, as he pleases, and staff he
may hire or dismiss as he sees fit? The extraordinary career of
George Soros, the Hungarian-born American billionaire investor, and
his Open Society Network demonstrate, if demonstration were
necessary, how pressing the question really is.</LD>
<LD>   On biographical form, Soros is an unlikely political and social
reformer. Born into a bourgeois Jewish family in Budapest in 1930,
Soros barely survived the Nazi era. At 17, he immigrated to London,
where, at the London School of Economics, he came under the influence
of Sir Karl Popper, one of whose books, "The Open Society and Its
Enemies," provided Soros with both the title and the template for his
democratic activism. Put crudely, Popper's view was that the
fundamental conflict in the modern world pitted the "open" societies
of the West against the "closed" worlds of communism and fascism. It
was the kind of schema that was bound to appeal to a young man who
had almost died at the hands of both kinds of totalitarianism.</LD>
<TE>   Soros wanted to be a philosopher, but Popper discouraged the
ambition. Winston Churchill once said that a man can tie his fate to
the mast of action or the mast of thought, but never to both, and
perhaps the great philosopher discerned that his young Hungarian
pupil had more aptitude for the former than for the latter. In any
case, Soros went into business and became, first in London and then
in New York, one of the great financial speculators of his time and a
pioneer of an investment instrument that, at the time, was still
something of a novelty, the hedge fund.</TE>
<TE>   Far from showing traces of idealism in his business life, Soros
was, if anything, known for ruthlessness. The mantra of the Gordon
Gekko character in the film "Wall Street"--"greed is good"--would
have served Soros perfectly well. His most famous coup was in 1992,
when he gambled that the British government would be unable to
protect the value of the pound sterling. Soros made more than a
billion dollars, an achievement that led the British press to dub him
"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England" and was said to have cost
every man, woman and child in the United Kingdom 12 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But while amassing his great fortune in the financial markets,
Soros also did something utterly unprecedented: He shifted the great
bulk of his energies to using the money he accumulated in perhaps the
most extraordinarily idealistic and systematic effort by any single
individual in modern history to change the world.</TE>
<TE>   Not for him the single-issue obsessions of his fellow plutocrats,
whether education, art, Israel or alma mater. Even an ambition as
vast as that of Microsoft's founder Bill Gates' to cure diseases like
AIDS and malaria pales before what Soros has attempted. He has
committed himself to reforming not one but virtually every aspect of
global society and global governance. And from transforming early
childhood education to unseating totalitarian regimes and replacing
them with liberal capitalist democracies to, more recently, reforming
the international financial architecture under whose auspices he
profited so extraordinarily but which he is now convinced stands in
desperate need of reform, little has escaped the attention of his
worldwide network.</TE>
<TE>   The formative work of his foundations in the late 1970s that would
eventually coalesce into the Open Society Institute, with more than
40 projects and national foundations in scores of countries from
South Africa to Burma and a budget in the hundreds of millions of
dollars, took place in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,
where their efforts were crucial in undermining the communist system
and, later, in shoring up the fledgling democracies that succeeded
it. Soros' name may be known only among the elite in America, but in
the former Soviet Union, he is a living legend, justifiably so.</TE>
<TE>   It is virtually impossible to overstate the importance of the work
Soros did in these countries of the former Warsaw Pact and that he
continued to do long after the Berlin Wall fell. His financial
support for dissident groups during the communist era may well have
been decisive. When Mikhail Gorbachev's regime seemed about to be
toppled by old-line Communists, Soros provided leaders of the
democracy movement, like the then-still compos mentis Boris Yeltsin,
with the photocopying machines they needed to get out the message of
resistance. What water and gasoline besieged Sarajevo obtained during
the war came thanks to a subset of Soros' foundation. And if Russian
scientists have jobs today, it is in no small measure thanks to the
$100-million grant Soros gave to prevent the Soviet scientific
edifice from crumbling away, with the predictable seepage of
physicists and experts in biological warfare to rogue states like
Iraq and Libya. These are a few of the literally dozens of critical
interventions Soros has undertaken that are publicly known.</TE>
<TE>   In his serviceable, informative, though wooden and rather
reductionist biography of Soros, Michael T. Kaufman quotes the
distinguished American diplomat and longtime Soros advisor, Morton
Abramowitz, to the effect that George Soros had become the "only
private citizen to have his own foreign policy." Or, as an American
diplomat in Central Asia put it to me a few years ago, admiration and
resentment vying for pride of place in his tone, "George does what
the U.S. government would do if it had the money." During the Cold
War and its aftermath, Soros came to be seen as valuable ally by the
U.S. government, even if some of his causes, notably the
decriminalization of drugs, made official Washington squirm. The Open
Society Institute could act when the United States government was
hamstrung, holding the fort, as it were, in places like Tajikistan
and Bosnia, while the executive branch made up its collective mind.</TE>
<TE>   But whether this close collaboration between Soros and the U.S.
government will continue in the 21st century is an open question.</TE>
<TE>   Soros has become steadily more critical of what he has dubbed
"market fundamentalism"--the ideology of globalization that commands
the loyalty of the Bush administration and holds that any
interference in markets by government reduces the efficiency of the
economy and, like most other forms of regulation, is to be resisted
at all costs. As a result, he has been accused of having gone over to
the "anti-globalization" camp, recalling his friend, Joseph Stiglitz,
the Nobel Prize-winning economist, and former senior official of the
World Bank, whose withering critique of the International Monetary
Fund has made him something of a poster child for the
anti-globalization left. In Soros' case, nothing could be further
from the truth. As he puts it in "On Globalization," which seems to
have been written as a way of detailing how the system might be
reformed, Soros writes, "I am passionately interested in improving
the system that has allowed me to be successful so that it will
become more enduring." That seems persuasive enough, and only in the
right-leaning political consensus of the United States could Soros
look like a leftist.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that is precisely the context in which he is trying to
operate, and antagonizing the powers that be, no matter how much
money he is willing to spend (Soros estimates that he spent $425
million annually through his foundations between 1997 and 2001), is
bound to get in the way of Soros' evident intention of influencing
American policy-making at the highest level. It is as if, in his
thinking, he has concluded that the U.S. is part of the problem,
while in his practice he is committed to the idea that its power
offers the solution to the world's ills.</TE>
<TE>   In "On Globalization," Soros appeals to the American elite to
eschew Realpolitik and embrace what he calls, somewhat
self-referentially, "open society idealism." Here, one cannot help
feeling that the dichotomous political choice he presents is not an
accurate rendering of those on offer. For surely what has
characterized the Bush administration, at least post-Sept. 11, has
not been realism a la Henry Kissinger but revolutionary
internationalism a la Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   After all, prudentially and in terms of immediate self-interest,
the U.S. has no reason to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Nor are there
great material benefits to be gained from doing so. International
tensions will rise, the price of oil will go up and the economy will
tank. That is why realist graybeards like Brent Scowcroft oppose an
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Soros' obvious, though mostly implicit, antipathy to the Bush
administration blinds him to the idealism of its position. Perhaps,
in that narrow sense, it is too close to his own idealism. But agree
with them or not, the Richard Perles and the Donald Rumsfelds want to
change the world just as surely as Soros does. They even say--and
here, though I oppose their prescription and view them as dangerous
radicals, I see no reason not to take them at their word--that their
goal is to take democracy to places that have long been denied it or
have never enjoyed it at all, just as Soros does. In a sense, his
quarrel is less with the realists than with these idealists of a
different stripe. But to judge by his writings, Soros has not yet
understood this.</TE>
<TE>   Doubtless he will. If Soros has demonstrated anything throughout
his career as both a speculator and an activist, it is his ability to
change. For even when he wears the motley of the philanthropist, the
hedge fund operator is never far from the surface. In countries where
he felt nothing much was being accomplished in furthering this goal
of "open societies," he has closed his foundations, selling such
"losing" ideological positions just as readily as, in business, he
sold losing financial ones.</TE>
<TE>   Soros has never been a humanitarian. At the beginning of the war
in the former Yugoslavia, he resisted calls by his staff to get
involved. Only when he became convinced that, in helping Bosnia, he
was not just helping people survive a war but also helping a
democratic, multicultural society resist the ethnic fascism of
Slobodan Milosevic's Serb nationalism did Soros agree to commit money
and staff. Typically, when he finally did, he became the largest
private donor to the U.N. aid effort, and the people he employed or
subsidized, notably the late Frederick Cuny, arguably the most
brilliant American relief worker of his generation, were crucial to
Bosnia's survival.</TE>
<TE>   Only a man persuaded of his own genius can achieve so much. And
that sense of mission and entitlement, for all the changes in focus
and ideology, has been the constant in Soros' career. But while he
prides himself on his ability to ask hard questions, neither he nor
his many admirers have taken seriously what is, when all is said and
done, the hardest moral question of all--that of democracy. For it is
on the anti-democratic foundation of his own will that all his
efforts at fostering democracy have been based. Were Soros a
latter-day Socrates and believed that an elite of "Guardians" should
control the destiny of ordinary people, the gulf between the
aristocratic method of Soros' foundations and their emancipatory and
pluralistic goals would be intellectually and morally less ambiguous.
Instead, Soros' extraordinary venture illustrates that oldest of
revolutionary dilemmas--the contradiction between ends and means.</TE>

<LD>THE WINTER ZOO</LD>
<LD>   By John Beckman</LD>
<LD>   Henry Holt: 352 pp., $25</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing had ever happened to Gurney. He had swerved through life
like Mr. Magoo." Gurney is the recent undergraduate at the heart of
John Beckman's sprawling, messy and thoroughly mesmerizing first
novel, a fascinating gazette of twentysomething American expats and
their eye-opening explorations of Krakow in 1990. It's the heady era
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Gurney has managed to flee a
more intimate kind of totalitarianism: His girlfriend back in Iowa
has just had his baby and he's opted for disreputable liberation,
buying a ticket to Krakow, where his cousin, Jane, has installed
herself as a kind of slacker sexpot Gertrude Stein. Welcome to the
new Lost Generation.</TE>
<TE>   In Krakow, the unworldly Gurney finds himself "on the frontier of
ethics--a beautiful world where anything goes!" He's surrounded by
young Americans overstimulated by exile: They take day trips to
Auschwitz, organize cabaret evenings that recall Berlin in the '30s
and attempt "to look more Polish than the Poles."</TE>
<TE>   But the decadence isn't all for show. Jane is a formidable sexual
predator, manipulator and gossip; Jackie, with whom Gurney has an
urgent fling, is embroiled in a tense sexual detente with her
erstwhile lover, Linda; and Wanda, the Polish teenager whose broken
family hosts Jane and Gurney, is awakening to a libidinous obsession
with Gurney, the tall, boyish, redheaded amerykanski who has landed
in her midst. And, as Beckman increasingly insinuates, Jane and
Gurney (who's now working as a croupier at a seedy casino) could, at
any moment, lapse into classically Byronic relations.</TE>
<TE>   With the possibility of a many-sided menage hanging in the sooty
Krakow air, Beckman expertly zeroes in on the unbearable tension that
so much freedom creates. It's as if excessive liberty and hopeless
entanglement are two opposing machines of history that threaten to
pulverize anyone caught between them, including everyone in Beckman's
Altman-sized cast.</TE>
<TE>   When Dick Chesnutt, a 40-year-old American pop singer and sexual
titan (his collection of Polaroids could have made actor Bob Crane
blush) is murdered by Wanda's psycho dad, "The Winter Zoo" transforms
itself from Henry Miller on a Eurailpass into a scary post-Soviet
thriller.</TE>
<TE>   With so much going on, Beckman's novel threatens to collapse, like
the Iron Curtain, under its own weighty ambition. Yet Beckman manages
to keep "The Winter Zoo" cruising along. He has a wonderful sense of
how the personal and political overlap (Krakow's awakening to
capitalism is every bit as reckless as the expats' erotic
gamesmanship), and his rootless young adults are, at once, spoiled
children and jaded libertines. Their pursuit of authenticity is so
relentless that you begin to suspect that the true object of their
yearnings is Krakow itself: the crumbling old Polish city that has
become, for them, a slummers' Prague, the ultimate anti-Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, as Gurney takes off for destinations unknown, "The
Winter Zoo" becomes a canny critique of the American way of youth,
where the expat antidote to four years of dorm life is just as
desperate and calculated as a four-kegger at State.</TE>

<TE>   ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY</TE>
<TE>   By Rose Connors</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 304 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Marty Nickerson, an assistant D.A. on Cape Cod and the gumshoe
heroine of Rose Connors' good-natured mystery, is an unlikely sleuth.
Her knowledge of the law, her unavoidable entrenchment in Barnstable
County Courthouse politics and her good conscience all work against
her when the brutal murder case she's prosecuting unravels before her
eyes: Just when Manuel Rodriguez is sentenced for killing a popular
20-year-old college student, another body turns up on one of the
Cape's idyllic beaches, suggesting that the crafty murderer is still
out there.</TE>
<TE>   What ensues is a standard-issue race against the clock, as Marty
tries to buck a system intent on convictions regardless of truth and
to track down a murderer whose signature is carving Roman numerals
into the torsos of his victims (the tally eventually reaches III).
But what brings "Absolute Certainty" into tight focus is Marty
herself, an earnest single mom who's not immune to the charms of her
rumpled courtroom adversary turned unlikely ally, Harry Madigan. As
Marty sets out to crack the case and possibly forfeit her job, she
takes us on a tour of the Cape that includes amusing asides about
local tuna brokers and the rather thrilling observation that the
Chatham dump "plays Chopin on Sunday afternoons."</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Marty's local pride is as disarming as "Absolute
Certainty's" conclusions about justice, human nature and a serial
killer's attempts to elude capture are gruesome.</TE>

<DH>AMERICAN HARDCORE: A Tribal Histor,y By Steven Blush, Feral
House: 336 pp., $19.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRISPIN SARTWELL</AU>
<BD>Crispin Sartwell is the author of "End of Story: Toward
an Annihilation of Language and History." He is chairman of
humanities at the Maryland Institute College of Art.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Probably the two most interesting strands in American popular music
since 1980 are hip-hop and hard-core punk. Both emerged organically
from alienated subcultures and deployed a radical aesthetic purity.</LD>
<LD>   Hip-hop has long had a literature, but hard-core punk is only
beginning to be documented and placed in historical perspective.
"American Hardcore" is an incredibly elaborate labor of love and is
likely to be the definitive treatment of hard-core for the
foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   Hard-core is the vicious, extremely fast rhythmic noise that grew
out of the work of original punk bands such as the Ramones and Sex
Pistols. It encompasses everything from racist skinheads to left-wing
anarchists, "straight-edge" ascetics and Hare Krishna thrash. Steven
Blush of course gives accounts of the careers of the fundamental
hard-core bands--Minor Threat, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys, for
example--and the fundamental scenes: L.A., Washington, D.C., and New
York. But surprisingly he also manages to capture regional hard-core
all over the country, and dozens or perhaps hundreds of bands, from
Reno's 7 Seconds to Austin's Dicks.</LD>
<TE>   Blush was a participant in the original hard-core world and was
the road manager for the Washington, D.C., band No Trend. And though
the book is constructed out of interviews with the people who were
there in the early '80s, it is also highly personal and opinionated.
This has made it controversial in the punk underground. But to my way
of thinking, Blush's assessments of bands and situations is usually
reasonable and acute. That Blush acts as a critic as well as a
historian makes the book all the more entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   The book leaves hard-core in the mid-'80s and basically asserts
that the style died at that point, disintegrating into "emo"
(emotional punk) and heavy metal. But hard-core punk is in the middle
of a wildly cool revival. Maybe that's Blush's next encyclopedia.</TE>

<DH>CITIZENS &amp; CANNIBALS: The French Revolution, the Struggle
for Modernity, and the Origins of Ideological Terror, By Eli Sagan,
Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 626 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is the author of "Peasants Into Frenchmen:
The Modernization of Rural France, 1870-1914." He is a contributing
writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A work will sometimes surface, so shallow in the profundity it
affects, so shoddily written and altogether so egregiously bad that
it calls for notice, even when the reviewer might prefer to set it
aside for others to appraise: not necessarily to warn potential
readers off, but to signal some of the hazards that await them. That
is the case with Eli Sagan's "Citizens and Cannibals."</LD>
<LD>   The best that I can fathom of the book is that it is about the
birth pangs of Modernity with a capital M, the anxieties which that
trauma inspires and the ensuing nervous disorders that spawn
terrified terrorists and "cannibalistic" terror, like that of
Robespierre, in the service of high ideals. But I could be wrong,
because the book is muddled and perplexing. A magpie collection of
untidy lore, all secondhand information scrupulously credited, it
promises a lot and delivers little. This history of the French
Revolution is to serve "as a prism through which to view, and attempt
to comprehend, the Modern world." Looking through a piece of glass
cut to reflect and analyze light becomes a figure of speech about
seeing reality transformed, and possibly deformed. But Sagan's
interpretation muddies rather than illuminates. So let's get a few
things clear.</LD>
<TE>   The revolution was not, as the subtitle implies, about modernity.
It was about money and food shortages. It started as a taxpayers'
revolt, and its most violent episodes turned on bread and wages.
Economic crisis, political crisis and violence surged in
counterpoint. Revolutionary measures presented as solutions to the
country's troubles made its problems worse. Political reform buttered
no parsnips, anarchy skidded into terror and the cascade of greater
and lesser massacres was only suspended by the dictatorship of a
soldier: Bonaparte. A logical outcome, because war was the only
successful enterprise of the revolution and the army the only growth
industry it wrought.</TE>
<TE>   If modernity is marked by secularism and trust in reason, then its
signs were there before the Bastille fell in 1789. If the essence of
modernity lies in industry, communication and consumption, the
revolution was a serious setback to its development. Far from being a
factor of modernization, it disorganized economic activity, chilled
credit, discouraged capital, held back industry and blocked growth
for a generation.</TE>
<TE>   Modernization was never an issue. The revolution struggled not for
modernity, but to return to a better world in some legendary past:
Athens, the Roman Republic, sylvan democracies, "natural" orders.
Modernization has been described as the mobilization of the masses
for economic progress, but that's not what the revolution offered or
revolutionaries wanted, which was political experiment, education,
indoctrination. Revolutionaries preferred political to industrial
revolution, ideological radicalization to practical solutions,
conflict to conciliation. They seared these tendencies into the
French tradition and invented modern politics. But that's nothing to
brag about.</TE>
<TE>   So it goes also with other words that Sagan likes to throw around:
"enlightenment," "liberalism," "people," "democracy," and so on. "I
will not attempt to differentiate between the concepts of
'Enlightenment' and 'liberalism' ... I shall use the concepts
interchangeably." That's not a good idea. True, both represent
aspects of modernity and modernization. But enlightenment, which
emphasized reason and individualism at the expense of tradition, was
administrative, bureaucratic, utilitarian and, above all, elitist.
Liberalism favored free trade and gradual, not abrupt, political and
social reform. Napoleon was the last enlightened despot, not the
first liberal one. Enlightenment was about efficiency; liberalism was
about liberty: laissez faire, laissez-passer. Neither concept was
much at home in revolutionary France, which replaced defective royal
absolutism with a despotism more absolute than anyone expected.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for democracy, another word Sagan likes to throw
around, which we take to mean government of the people, by the
people, and also an indifference to hereditary class distinctions and
tolerance of minority views. After the revolution, rights became
equal, at least in theory and hereditary distinctions, before they
came back in full force, designating preferred victims. Sagan talks a
lot about the people of France, though that people is never defined.
At times the people provide "powerful" support from below, at times
they are presented as "a mass society democratically constituted," at
others "the elite of the Third Estate." But we are also told that
less than 3% of the population enrolled in Jacobin clubs. So, just
how powerful was support from below, if you bear in mind that the
revolution played out in urban centers, and that urban population was
no more than 16% of the country's total, that three out of five men
and four out of five women could not sign their marriage
certificates?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the great weakness of the revolution rested precisely in
its feeble popularity. But it is characteristic of the
revolutionaries that their rhetoric about education (another Sagan
topic) largely ignored basic literacy and focused on more
ostentatious goals like inculcating patriotism, morality and civic
virtue. The schools that they projected were less about the three Rs
than about forming and reforming citizens. Schoolteachers were not to
be called teachers (enseignants) but institutors (instituteurs),
because their task was to institute the nation, to forge the
character and hone the virtues of citizens-to-be. But it is easier to
cut off heads than fill them; and dreams of universal schooling were
not realized until the end of the next century. Still, fantasies can
be revelatory; and so is Sagan's take on the great revolutionary
fantasy of creating a new man. He notes its failure, but is so
fascinated by noble aspirations that he ignores the baser need for
literacy that schooling might have served.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of failure stems from the author's paying more attention
to what people said than to what they did. He is interested in
ideology, in ideas; less so in the concrete experience and cares of
ordinary people. His categories and theories ignore petty
considerations of drought, hunger, vengeance, hope, fear and
vindictiveness, let alone family and local memory of alliances and
antagonisms going back to the religious wars of the 16th century.</TE>
<TE>   Hence his treatment of religious conflicts, which had little to do
with secular ideas, as he seems to think, and much to do with the
country's insoluble budgetary mess. That led to the confiscation of
church property that had provided the upkeep of churchmen and their
activities. When the clergy became salaried civil servants, they were
expected to swear a loyalty oath to the state that paid them. But the
church is a multinational corporation, its head office is in Rome and
the pope would not allow his clergy to swear allegiance to a rival
power. Priests taking the oath were excommunicated by the pope;
priests who refused to swear it were exiled, imprisoned or executed.
This impasse divided the country as it did the church, and turned
political conflict into holy war: "The people" were deeply attached
to their saints, to their church bells, to the rites of protection
and passage that the priests performed. And so was the king, who lost
his head in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Once the king had been disposed of and dire economic troubles had
been exacerbated by civil and foreign war, terror followed: an
exceptional situation in which frightened but determined rulers used
fear and force to intimidate their subjects and to rid themselves of
political enemies they denounced as enemies of the people. In the
history of the revolution, the 12 months of terror appear as a
hiccup, although a gory (and premonitory) one. In Sagan's argument
they become "the great black gift of Modernity" and of its panic
fallout. Again, theorizing obscures the context of misery and hunger,
the frantic calls for bread, the struggle between cities and the
countryside for the latter's grain.</TE>
<TE>   More basically though, Sagan ignores the prevalence of violence in
daily life before 1789 and before the terror. The brutality and
malignancy of the terrorists reflected everyday muggings, robberies,
brawls, rapes and murders. Before the establishment of law
enforcement agencies, public order could not be maintained without
terror or its threat. In 1789, 40% of the population depended on
charity or extortion, gangs scoured the countryside, rioters in the
streets of Paris butchered their prey while shouting threats about
cutting out liver, hearts, kidneys--all kinds of meat they only
dreamed about. The brigands whom Sagan dismisses as "fictional" and
"nonexistent" were popular heroes because so many of the people saw
themselves as potential brigands.</TE>
<TE>   While the king's armies that once policed the kingdom fought the
republic's wars, revolutionary forces of armed civilians marched out
of towns to squeeze supplies from reluctant peasants. At every level,
everyday violence that had been endemic and diffuse was
institutionalized as part of politics. Not least, the riots and
massacres that preceded, accompanied and succeeded the terror were
perpetrated by people with empty stomachs or drunk on adulterated
wine--plonk, high in alcoholic content, coloring matter, alum and
other chemicals. That is the other side of the terror, one to which
Sagan pays no heed.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated by the paranoid aspect of revolutionary politics, Sagan
has nothing to say about the violent and uncertain aspirations of the
late 18th century, the apocalyptic perspectives, the upsurge of
dreams, visions, theosophies, illuminisms, mesmerism, occultism,
millenarianism, secret societies, all promising regeneration, that
might place terror in a different light than that of "regressive
paranoid behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Sagan mention the youth of the chief figures of the
terror and their political inexperience. Yet Robespierre was 36 when
he went to the guillotine; Danton, 35; Desmoulins, 33 (age, as he
claimed, of the sans-culotte Jesus); and Saint-Just, 27. And there's
not a word about the humorlessness and credulousness of the average
terrorist true believer. But that's enough of that. You have been
warned.</TE>

much of what they hailed as progress for African American actors. Yet
this level of achievement isn't as new as it may seem.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, individuals have been breaking barriers and staking
out similar territory, if not that precise statuette. The evidence
that prejudice persists lies as much in how few of these individuals
there have been, as in the fact that their accomplishments are
largely forgotten the moment the cameras turn away.</LD>
<LD>   As far back as the '50s and as recently as the '90s, there have
been and continue to be performers like Diahann Carroll and Phylicia
Rashad. As multitalented actress-singers with decades of credits in
theater, film and television, their triumphs are incontestable. But
the fact that these two African Americans have achieved what they
have in an industry still marred by racism makes their careers all
the more impressive.</LD>
<TE>   Carroll and Rashad are now appearing together for the first time
in Charles Randolph-Wright's "Blue," opening next Sunday at the
Pasadena Playhouse. The lighthearted drama about an
upper-middle-class family that owns a funeral home in a small South
Carolina town features music by Nona Hendryx and is being staged by
playhouse artistic director Sheldon Epps.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll made her Broadway and film debuts in the mid-'50s, and in
1968, when her show "Julia" premiered, she became one of the first
African American female stars of a television series. In addition to
her 1962 Tony award for "No Strings," best actress Golden Globe award
in 1968 for "Julia" and Emmy and Grammy nominations, as well as
numerous other tributes, she was nominated for a best actress Oscar
in 1974--long before Berry's much ballyhooed nod.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad, a veteran of many Broadway productions, is best known for
her pivotal role as Bill Cosby's wife on the landmark television
series "The Cosby Show," and later on the series "Cosby."</TE>
<TE>   Would Carroll and Rashad have had even greater opportunities if
they'd been white? "Without a doubt," Epps says. "And I would also
add CCH Pounder. These extraordinary actresses have had great
careers, but frankly, not the kind of careers they deserve, and not
the kind they would have had if they hadn't been African American
actresses.</TE>
<TE>   "These actresses have won Tony awards and done films and major
television shows," Epps continues. "But if you take any single one of
those things that either one of those women did and thought of that
as a launching pad, what would that launching pad have resulted in if
they'd been white? And as much as they've done, I guarantee you that
either one of those women would've had 10 times the opportunities
that they've had if they'd been white.</TE>
<TE>   "Any white actress who'd been on [one of] the most successful
series in the history of television would constantly be on a series
now. Where is Phylicia's series? Why haven't they developed a series
just for her?"</TE>
<TE>   Nor are actors the only ones who continue to run into invisible
barriers. "It's also something that Charles Randolph-Wright and I
talk about, because we both have had really wonderful careers," says
Epps, playhouse artistic director since 1997. He conceived and
directed the musicals "Blues in the Night" and "Play On!" The former
was nominated for a best musical Tony and the latter received three
Tony nominations and was filmed for PBS' "Great Performances."</TE>
<TE>   "People look at you and they think, 'Well they've done such
extraordinary things,' " Epps continues. "But I think that neither
Charles nor I have had some of the opportunities that we would have
had if we hadn't been black director-writers."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll and Rashad sit on white patio furniture in a tiny
courtyard behind the Madilyn Clark studios in North Hollywood, amid
aging latticework and scrappy bougainvillea. Outshining their
surroundings like visiting royalty, they lend an aura of elegance to
the otherwise modest location, where they are rehearsing "Blue."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, to engage in conversation with these two great American
actresses is to glimpse the difference between true stardom and the
mere celebrity that often passes for it. It isn't so much their
ageless beauty that strikes you, though that is stunning, but the
combination of charm, intelligence and integrity that so clearly goes
with it.</TE>
<TE>   As one would expect with artists of this stature, they know the
importance of choosing their projects carefully. "This is a
well-written play with many layers and textures," says Rashad, who
starred in two previous productions of "Blue" directed by Epps, the
2000 premiere at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and last spring's
staging at the Roundabout Theatre Company in New York. "It's subtle
and that's the kind of work I like to do."</TE>
<TE>   Both Rashad and Carroll have returned to the stage throughout
their careers. "I have to go back to the well," says Carroll,
speaking on the day after returning from taping an episode of the
Showtime series "Soul Food." "The work that I do requires theater. As
long as I'm not doing the stairs in 'Sunset Boulevard'--739 steps
each performance!" she adds, referring to her stint in the Andrew
Lloyd Webber musical, as the two actresses share one of many laughs,
tinged with recognition and show biz bonhomie.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue" is a memory play spanning two decades and centered in the
home of the Clark family, which has run a funeral parlor for
generations. Mother Peggy (Rashad) is a stylish woman keenly out of
place in her provincial surroundings, and her sons, husband,
mother-in-law (Carroll) and others do their best to negotiate her
eccentricities. Meanwhile, exerting a powerful influence on their
lives is the magnetic jazz singer Blue Williams (Michael McElroy).</TE>
<TE>   "This is a wonderful, dysfunctional comedic family and friends,"
Carroll says. "I'm drawn to things that are dysfunctional because
they're usually honest."</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the New York Times, Bruce Weber called "Blue" "an
amiable featherweight of a play," describing the fictional Clarks,
who are loosely inspired by playwright Randolph-Wright's relatives,
as "a clan built to prime-time specifications."</TE>
<TE>   In dramaturgical terms, the play is, indeed, fairly conventional.
What makes it innovative is its use of music--the songs figure
prominently, and the title character functions as a kind of Greek
chorus--and its milieu.</TE>
<TE>   Both Epps and his actresses hail Randolph-Wright's accomplishment
in bringing upper-middle-class African American life to the stage.
"He is writing about an experience and a facet of American society
that we don't see, and he is writing about it in a firsthand
account," Rashad says.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, it is a background that playwright and
director--and to some extent, even the two actresses--share. Both
Randolph-Wright and Epps come from families that include Southern
funeral home proprietors. Rashad's mother grew up 15 miles from
Randolph-Wright's hometown in South Carolina, and Carroll has strong
family ties in the South.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not a world that is widely known to white America. "The
fact that this play deals with this very specific world of the
upper-middle-class or even upper-class black aristocracy in the South
was something that I knew about because of my family, but something
that I don't think I've seen on a stage before, or for that matter,
in movies or television," Epps says.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, some people say it's unbelievable," he continues. "I
actually remember, after the play opened in New York and I was doing
an interview and somebody challenged me and said, 'Well, it kind of
lacks believability, doesn't it, that this Southern black family
would know all those things?' I remember saying to the interviewer,
'Well, just because you haven't had lunch with me, doesn't mean that
I don't exist.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Clarks are established in their community. "It is stated that
previous generations did exceedingly well," Rashad says. "This is a
fact, and this is what we don't see."</TE>
<TE>   "This is why some people have difficulty accepting these
characters; they didn't just get here," Carroll adds. "Grandma is a
complete representative of the fact that she is a product of
something that allowed her to be different in her girlhood."</TE>
<TE>   The something that allowed Grandma to be different was being
brought up to believe in her right to success. But just as such
beliefs do not take hold overnight, it can also take generations for
people to distance themselves from racism.</TE>
<TE>   This point was recently driven home for Carroll. "I was talking to
two young black actors, male and female, about an incident when
someone had been insulted by someone who was white," she says. "And
in the middle of this discussion, I realized that I was very upset.
And the two young people were looking at me, and I realized it did
not touch them the way it touched me. It was the same as saying,
'Well, you know, she takes heroin, what am I going to do?' "</TE>
<TE>   For Carroll, the past is ever-present. "I come from things they've
never seen, heard, done, having to do with racism," she explains.
"They don't even have a way to relate to some of the things. They had
never experienced racism in the way that I have experienced it. When
they're in the presence of that, they consider it a kind of stupidity
and they move on."</TE>
<TE>   That, in a way, is what the Clarks have done. "This family has
moved into that area, more so," Carroll says, drawing parallels
between the young actors' attitude and the Clark family's outlook.
"They have moved on."</TE>
<TE>   But it is not what the entertainment industry has done. Witness
the celebration over Berry and Denzel Washington's Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   For Carroll, this year's Oscar celebrations were almost
anti-climactic. "It's very, very nice that Halle wins, it's lovely,"
she says. "Did it have the meaning that it would have had, had I won
it when I was 30? It would have had a different meaning. It doesn't
have that meaning today. It's terrible, but that says it: It's very
nice.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what it means to her to be able to stand there and
say, 'Finally.' But that's all it is."</TE>
<TE>   Says Epps, "Is Halle Berry's Oscar going to produce a lot more
work for black actresses? I think Halle Berry's Oscar is going to
produce a lot more work for Halle Berry. She will be offered more
scripts. She won't be offered the same number of scripts that a white
actress who won the Oscar last year would've been offered."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the situation better in theater. "Tony awards usually
produce, for actresses not of color, a tremendous number of
opportunities," Epps says. "Suddenly they have a development deal,
and they have a television series, and they have this and they have
that. Historically speaking, that has not been true with women of
color who have won the Tony."</TE>
<TE>   So it goes for directors of color as well. "I read a lot lately
about Sam Mendes," says Epps, who in addition to extensive theater
credits has directed a great deal of episodic television in the past
six years. "Here's a director who came from the theater and suddenly,
like many young white directors from the theater who've had some
success, he's skyrocketed as a movie director. That does not usually
happen with black directors. Charles is a good example. I'm a good
example. [Playwright-director] Marion McClinton is a good example. So
is [Public Theater artistic director] George Wolfe. Any one of us
who've done what we've done and had the number of high-profile
successes that we've had would be getting chased by some studio by
now, like [La Jolla Playhouse artistic director] Des McAnuff or
[Broadway director] Scott Elliott."</TE>
<TE>   Television is only very slightly better. "I'm really fortunate and
the range of work that I've done in the theater has helped to result
in the range of opportunities that I've had in television," Epps
says. "Yes, I've gotten to direct 'Frasier,' and 'Friends,' and this
year I'm going to direct 'Everybody Loves Raymond.' But I am the
black director of those shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful for the opportunity and I'm grateful to have kicked
that door open, but I wish there was somebody else in the room with
me."</TE>
<TE>   Talk to those who have not merely survived but excelled, and the
themes that often resound are ones of responsibility and integrity.
As much as possible, it's essential to try to take charge of one's
creative destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to, and we do gratefully, keep generating our own work,"
Epps says. "One of the reasons I took this job as artistic director
of a theater--and I dare say it's one of the reasons that George
Wolfe took his job--is that I can say this is a project that I want
to do and now I have a place to do it."</TE>
<TE>   "Blue" is a good case in point--and a labor of love for Epps and
his actresses. They see it as a work that is both extremely specific
yet broadly appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who have seen this play, in Washington and New
York, from European countries, and they have come backstage to say,
'That was my mother,' " Rashad says. "There was a Jewish lady who
came backstage once, a middle-aged woman, and she said, 'Oh, I saw
myself in that character. I'm going to tone down just a little.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Because this is what art is, it's a mirror," Rashad says. "People
are much more alike than we could ever be different. And when you
present the human experience in a light of universality, this is what
happens, people accept it as the truth. That's why we're artists."</TE>

<LD>Irish writers aren't expected to promote U2.</LD>
<LD>   Canadian critics aren't bound to back Neil Young.</LD>
<LD>   So why must a Mexican reporter be partial to singer Paulina Rubio
just because she's Mexican too?</LD>
<TE>   That thinking seemed to be behind some of the negative response to
an article I recently wrote about Rubio, the former teen star who
launched a crossover attempt this year with her English album,
"Border Girl." Some readers thought the piece was too critical. One
even posted a rebuttal on a local Spanish-language radio station's
Web site wondering if I have something against Mexican performers.</TE>
<TE>   It's an old dilemma: Minority journalists have long faced pressure
to show their loyalty to their ethnic group more than to their
profession. The mentality is a holdover from the days when minority
journalists were a rarity in newsrooms. If you were one of the few
who made it, you had a responsibility to the many who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Taken to extremes, minority journalists were expected to be
cheerleaders for their ethnic group. Those who betrayed the charge
were labeled vendidos--sellouts.</TE>
<TE>   Those sentiments have faded somewhat, with the era that spawned
them. But the issue still raises its ugly head every once in a while,
including in coverage of the arts.</TE>
<TE>   That's where it gets especially tricky.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, I wrote a mildly critical column about
Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican singer who was riding high with his
crossover smash "Livin' la Vida Loca." All I said, essentially, was
that Martin's success may mislead people into thinking he represented
real Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   Some Latino readers, obvious Ricky fans, responded with racial
vitriol. They questioned whether I was really a Latino. One caller
made a cynical remark about my dark complexion, apparent from my
picture that appeared with my former culture column in the old Metro
section. How could I be so dark, she asked, and turn against a Latino
performer? She ignored the fact that Martin is a fair-skinned Puerto
Rican.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio, who hails from Mexico City, is also so blond and fair that
she goes by the nickname "La Chica Dorada," the Golden Girl. Her
European looks have been essential to her success as a singer and
soap opera star in Mexico, where the media are notoriously biased
against people with dark, indigenous features.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican TV, until recently a monopoly, has come under fire for
creating a color line for stardom. European-looking artists are
groomed for celebrity, while those who look too Indian are relegated
to roles as maids or chauffeurs.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio comes out of that star-making machinery. As a girl, she was
a member of the teeny-bop group Timbiriche, a pop-music creation of
Televisa, Mexico's media conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   The group actually had its charm and wide pop appeal. You could
compare it to a younger version of the Monkees, the pre-fab '60s pop
group that was made for TV. Like the Monkees, the members of
Timbiriche were scorned to some degree for being pretty faces without
real talent.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that fans here could have fun with the Monkees
and get their real musical fix from the Rolling Stones or the Doors.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, however, Timbiriche was all there was. Not literally,
of course. But the media monopoly was so powerful at one time that
virtually no performers could break through on a mass scale without
the blessing of Televisa.</TE>
<TE>   To some, that was the ruin of Mexican pop culture. Musical tastes
were imposed from the top down, like politics. Fresh or challenging
ideas in art were considered a threat, like true democracy.</TE>
<TE>   That history was the backdrop to my critical profile of Rubio,
which questioned the artistic value of her latest marketing move into
the U.S. I didn't criticize her because she was Mexican, but because
of what she represents to Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I should have made that point more explicit. Because if I
have a bias, it's in favor of those alternative Mexican performers
who have struggled so hard against their country's unforgiving
star-making machinery.</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, I've written favorably about alt-rock singer Ely
Guerra, folk-style guitarist and composer Fernando Delgadillo,
musical historian and performer Jaramar, and aging rock guitarist
Javier Batiz.</TE>
<TE>   All are Mexicans like me. In light of their neglected artistry, I
confess feeling a twinge of patriotism about promoting them.</TE>

<HD>From His Room to Our Ears</HD>
<DH>How did Australia's Vines become the first of the new
passionate rockers to break through in the U.S.? Try a series of
discoveries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There isn't a record executive in America who wouldn't hurl a
seven-figure contract at the Australian rock band the Vines after
seeing just 30 seconds of the group's new "Outtathaway" video.</LD>
<LD>   In the clip, which will be released to MTV this month, gripping
lead singer and guitarist Craig Nicholls flails around the stage of a
gritty rock club, his eyes rolling eerily back into his head as if an
exorcism is taking place.</LD>
<LD>   It's a striking image that links Nicholls with the long tradition
of obsessive rock stars. The music mixes the raw energy of Nirvana
and the lively, garage-rock sensibilities of current media faves the
Hives.</LD>
<TE>   The sights and sounds of the Vines place the band right in step
with a cadre of new bands that are rejecting the drab,
one-dimensional anger and alienation of late-'90s U.S. rock by
drawing on the energy and imagination of legendary rock acts of the
'60s.</TE>
<TE>   This movement was jump-started in recent months by the success of
the Strokes, the White Stripes and the Hives--bands with varying
styles, but a shared independence and passion that have caught the
ear of media taste-makers and adventurous fans in this country.</TE>
<TE>   The Vines came to the party late and their vision isn't as focused
or as absorbing as the Stripes' or the Hives', but the group is
extremely promising and has been gaining momentum rapidly. They were
discovered by the rock world last fall in England, where New Musical
Express, a pop weekly with enormous influence on the music scene
there, began championing them after just one single.</TE>
<TE>   "The Vines are the latest group to offer a thrilling,
stripped-down take on the traditional rock 'n' roll blueprint," the
weekly wrote. "Their songs are short, sharp and fuzzily melodic."</TE>
<TE>   For most U.S. fans, the discovery process began weeks ago when MTV
and alt-rock radio stations, including KROQ-FM (106.7) in Los
Angeles, began playing "Get Free," a statement of youthful
desperation that has been described as Cobain-like.</TE>
<TE>   That exposure built enough of a following for the group's debut
album, "Highly Evolved," to enter the U.S. chart in July at No.
11--the highest position gained by any of the bands in the new
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The Vines seem so perfectly suited to this new energy that it's
easy to suspect that they've tailored their music to fit the
stripped-down tone of the times. But Nicholls was writing the songs
on "Highly Evolved" in his bedroom at his parents' house in suburban
Sydney three years ago, when the group's style could hardly have been
less commercially viable.</TE>
<TE>   It's only through the faith of a series of industry professionals
that the band was able to burst on the scene with such impact. The
band's story is an example of how all bands have to go through
numerous private discoveries before reaching public attention.</TE>
<TE>   The first discovery in the Vines' case was in the winter of 1999
when two of their Australian managers, Andy Kelly and Andy Cassell,
saw them playing to 20 people in a tiny club in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   "They were incredibly scrappy and totally obsessed with the
music," Kelly says. "Within 30 seconds, I turned to Andy and said,
'Do you see the same thing I see?' Craig was just lost in his world
on stage, playing this amazing music. We couldn't believe this person
that no one knew anything about could have so much talent and
charisma.</TE>
<TE>   "They had only done about five or six shows to this point. Craig
spent all his time writing songs and recording them on this little
tape machine. We asked for some tapes, and he was so prolific that we
ended up with about 21 songs. Normally, you'd pick the best four or
five of them and send them to producers and record executives, but we
sent them all because there wasn't a weak track on the tape."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Schnapf, a Los Angeles record producer who has worked with
Beck and the Foo Fighters, heard the demo tape early in 2000 and was
so excited he sent an e-mail to the band's representatives simply
repeating the band's name hundreds of times: "The Vines, the Vines,
the Vines ...."</TE>
<TE>   "Now people are saying a lot about this Nirvana stuff," Schnapf
says. "What I heard was the primal snottiness of the early Kinks. I
hadn't heard anybody do that in a while. It was all Limp Bizkit and
Korn stuff, which does nothing for me. This is the kind of music I
like--good songs and that primal feeling. It makes you want to drive
fast."</TE>
<TE>   By summer 2001, the Vines were in Los Angeles beginning work on
the album with Schnapf. The sessions weren't easy. It was the first
time the shy Nicholls had been out of Australia, and he and his
bandmates, bassist Patrick Matthews and drummer Dave Olliffe,
apparently found it difficult to adjust to Los Angeles. Nicholls was
also worried about his music being compromised in the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "Craig was very protective of his turf," Schnapf says. "I worked
hard at trying to show him that I was there to help, that I cared as
much about his music as he did. He's totally obsessed by the music.
People talk a lot about how he seems to lose himself in the music on
stage. It's no act. I'd be at the console watching him just going out
of his mind some days, bouncing off the walls. He was so intense
about what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   About three weeks into the sessions at Sunset Sound Factory, Andy
Slater, president of Capitol Records, bumped into Nicholls and was so
intrigued by his persona that he made it a point to listen to the
Vines' music. It was the final piece in the discovery process, and he
signed the Vines to Capitol a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   A former manager and producer who made a quick impression around
town by helping launch the careers of such substantial talents as the
Wallflowers, Fiona Apple and Macy Gray, Slater had only been at
Capitol for a few months and he was looking for new acts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at the studio with OK Go another new band on the label, and
this kid walked in and he had this immediate presence. He wasn't
looking at anything in particular, just wandering around the studio
kinda looking at the air. Sometimes artists are tapped in to some
other dimension that enables them to articulate things we want to say
but sometimes can't. He felt like someone who was tapped in."</TE>
<TE>   About the music, Slater, who served as executive producer of the
album, says, "I was floored. It had all the energy and spirit of rock
'n' roll rebellion, yet all the melodic sense that a gifted
singer-songwriter would bring to a record. For a while now, you get a
feeling listening to the radio that we are coming to the end of one
era in rock and the beginning of another one. No one knows just what
shape the new one would take, but this music sounded like what should
be on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   Having seen the excitement in England over the new wave of bands,
Capitol and the Vines' managers decided to showcase the group there,
and it was an immediate hit with the media. Capitol even flew U.S.
radio programmers to England to sample the buzz. When "Highly
Evolved" was released, NME, with its usual exaggerated enthusiasm,
was predicting that the Vines would be bigger than U2 by the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Olliffe left the group last fall, complaining about pressures
within the band. He is now with another Australian group, the Red Sun
Band. Rhythm guitarist Ryan Griffiths, an old chum from Sydney, has
joined Nicholls, Matthews and new drummer Hamish Rosser.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the media fascination with the band centers on Nicholls,
whose obsessive tendencies on stage and his sometimes nervous
outbursts backstage before shows tempt writers to associate him with
the self-destructive tradition of rock singers that stretches from
Jim Morrison to Cobain.</TE>
<TE>   Some see his out-of-control antics, including a recent spot on
"Late Show With David Letterman," as contrived. Others worry that it
is more deeply rooted and alarming. This summer, NME warned darkly,
"Our advice is simple: see them soon. You never know. It could be the
only chance you get."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Nicholls frowns at the idea that he's
self-destructive.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no," he says. "I am just passionate about what we do. People
often think I'm freaking out when we're playing, but there's a joy in
turning yourself over to the music and letting it lift you. It's
almost a sacred thing to us."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholls, one of four children, describes his childhood as
pleasant--nothing like the dysfunctional stories of so many of the
grunge-era rock stars. His father is an accountant, his mother a
secretary. Before music, he loved skateboarding and drawing, and he
took a graphic design course in college.</TE>
<TE>   But music has been his first love since his mid-teens. He recalls
the excitement of hearing Nirvana's "Nevermind" and trying to play
the songs on a guitar. He later traced some of Nirvana's influences
to the Beatles, the Kinks and other '60s rock bands.</TE>
<TE>   "There was something very artistic, worthwhile about what I heard
in those records," he says, warming up to the topic. "It felt real,
like someone expressing his life passion, not just making music to
get on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   There were '90s bands that Nicholls liked, but not the American
anger brigade. He preferred the more upbeat, melodic sounds of such
British bands as the Verve, calling its "Bittersweet Symphony" a
masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an intensity to our music that may sound like negativity
sometimes, but mostly I see the music as optimistic," he says. "I'm
certainly an optimistic person. I don't see any point in being alive
if you're not. Music helps you feel that way. It has certainly lifted
me. Before music, there wasn't much in the world for me to do. It
gave me a reason to go outdoors."</TE>
<TE>   At Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, where the Vines are filming the
"Outtathaway" video, Nicholls sits quietly in a dressing room and
stares at the wall. He's polite but not big on eye contact. His
co-manager Kelly attributes it to shyness. You see this quality even
more when he steps in front of a camera, all but shutting down as he
closes his eyes or offers a blank expression.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's his shield, his protection," Kelly says. "I don't
think he's trying to project an image. On the contrary, he often
finds it difficult to understand why people are interested in him or
why people, especially in England, are trying to make him into
something he's not. The only thing he's interested in is writing and
recording music. Back home, he pretty much stayed in his room and
worked on his music. That was his whole life.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job at the moment is to take a bit of the heat off the band
and go home. They've been away from home for over a year. They need
to go home and be normal."</TE>
<TE>   Following its scheduled appearance last week on the MTV Video
Music Awards, the band was due to fly home for some rest before its
most extensive tour--a trek that will include shows in Australia,
Europe and the U.S. The shows could tell us a lot about the future of
the Vines because discovery by the fans is the only one that really
matters.</TE>

<HD>In a Foreign Land</HD>
<DH>Singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd is rising in a world she
knew little of: pop culture</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mia Doi Todd gathers up paint supplies from a small rug in her loft
overlooking the Los Angeles River. Hanging on the wall is the project
she's working on--a life-size painting of the very rug that's on the
floor.</LD>
<LD>   The work will be used as the backdrop for her concerts on a tour
she'll be commencing soon to spread the word about her album "The
Golden State," which comes out Tuesday. "That way I'll have something
of my home to take with me on the road," she says in a voice that's
little more than a whisper.</LD>
<LD>   Todd, 27, has been away from home before. She spent four years at
Yale as an East Asian studies major, a year living in New York and
another year in Japan on a grant to study modern butoh dance.</LD>
<TE>   But most of her childhood was split time between Silver Lake, home
to her mother, California Court of Appeals Associate Justice Kathryn
Doi Todd, and here in the adjacent neighborhood known as
Frogtown--which offered a perfect home and work space for her father,
sculptor Michael Todd. (Her parents divorced when she was 8.)</TE>
<TE>   That she wants to have a reminder of those roots with her on tour
is fitting. The music on "The Golden State," her major-label debut
for Columbia Records after three independent albums, is as singular
in nature as her home.</TE>
<TE>   Her lyrics are often intensely intimate--sometimes almost
uncomfortably so, sounding like pages from a personal journal not
meant for others to read, from the declaration of strength that is
"Independence Day" to the startling post-sex poetry of "Poppy
Fields."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I feel 'Poppy Fields' is too much," Todd says. "But
when I get to perform it, it's a real gift to share."</TE>
<TE>   The music is just as arresting, generally eschewing the standard
pop verse-chorus structures. Rather, with her drony acoustic guitar
as the foundation, it unfolds and evolves in snaky melodies, with
minimalist accents and ornamentation designed by producer Mitchell
Froom. At the center is her remarkable voice, a full, round
instrument that shows her childhood operatic training and seems all
the more stunning coming from this slight, meek-seeming woman.</TE>
<TE>   A key element in her artistic development may well be something
she didn't have much of growing up: exposure to pop music.</TE>
<TE>   "She has no musical influences," says Yves Beauvais, the Columbia
vice president of A&amp;R who signed Todd to her record contract.</TE>
<TE>   "She developed her sound completely in her own way."</TE>
<TE>   Todd says that's not entirely so but acknowledges that her
influences are very limited.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in something of a vacuum in pop culture," she says. "My
parents did not listen to [pop] music anymore by the time I came
around. My father listened to jazz. But they had a stack of records
in the corner."</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, a curious Todd thumbed through the ignored
collection and found herself particularly attracted to the first few
albums by Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   "Joni Mitchell was such a fine craftswoman in songs and lyrics,"
she says. "And the mood of Cohen, the dark humor and simplicity,
meant a lot to me."</TE>
<TE>   Not long after that, she stumbled on music by Nico, the one-time
Velvet Underground singer who in the '60s and '70s made dark music
sung in her cold, German-accented delivery.</TE>
<TE>   She regards Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar and jazz singer Nina
Simone as her idols, and at Yale she sang in a choral group focusing
on the often dissonant 20th century classical repertoire. So although
her initial music orientation was in the singer-songwriter format,
her sense of aesthetics veered to other styles. "I didn't pick up any
folky mannerisms along the way," she says.</TE>
<TE>   At Yale, she began as a theater major, with the goal of becoming
an actress, but found roles in plays limited, she says, because of
her "ambiguous race" identification (her father is of Irish heritage,
her mother Japanese).</TE>
<TE>   Leaving theater, she started writing songs and performing them in
small clubs and coffeehouses. Soon she joined a rock band, taking up
electric guitar with a distortion pedal, then she played drums with
another group.</TE>
<TE>   All of this came into play as her style evolved over the course of
three independent albums: "The Ewe and the Eye" in 1997; "Come Out of
Your Mine," made in a late-night solo session in a Yale chapel in
1997 while she was living in New York; and last year's "Zeroone,"
which showcased several songs that have been rerecorded for "The
Golden State."</TE>
<TE>   It was while Todd was living in New York that Beauvais became a
fan. Officially employed by Columbia's jazz division, he discussed
finding a way to work with her and ultimately fashioned a deal with
the label's pop wing last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a glut of pop product that I think labels are
looking for original voices," Beauvais says. "Do we see Mia as an
immediate, mainstream success? No. We think of her as someone who
will be around for a long time and someone with an original point of
view. Her originality is undeniable."</TE>
<TE>   Although she seems an odd fit in today's pop world, where even
Avril Lavigne, Michelle Branch and others in the new crop of female
singer-songwriters sport fairly conventional approaches and MTV-ready
packaging, Todd says she has felt at home with Columbia so far,
largely because she's been under the radar.</TE>
<TE>   "Yves has high expectations for me," Todd says. "But at the
company in general, there was no pressure on me. Most people there
hadn't seen me play and had no idea I had three albums."</TE>
<TE>   But it's clearly a new arena for her.</TE>
<TE>   After playing almost exclusively solo in recent years, she's
rehearsing with three musicians who will back her on her first real
tour (including a show at the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Sept.
25).</TE>
<TE>   Still, she has few reservations about the leap to the major-label
world.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted better distribution, wanted to tour Europe," she says.
"Really, I have to try. It's a booster shot. The last album I put out
myself, and there's only so much you can do. Now I have a publicist,
a layout person for the artwork, someone overseeing my Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully it all won't.... " She goes silent and slumps limply in
her chair, playing dead.</TE>

<DH>Simone Young, the first female conductor to appear with Los
Angeles Opera, has had similar experiences around the world</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion has been transformed into
the fanciful world of a bygone-era western movie: On one side, a
cutaway cabin complete with a politically questionable Indian couple
inside and a hitching rail outside; on the other, a woodsy hill with
a tunnel passageway.</LD>
<LD>   An extremely patient pinto named Flash, saddled and bridled in his
western show-biz best, is being ridden for the first time by game but
tentative soprano Catherine Malfitano. Around and around the circular
track they go, disappearing into the mountain tunnel and emerging
around the other side again--sometimes together, sometimes not.</LD>
<LD>   Malfitano, who is making her role debut as the Bible-toting and
saloon-owning heroine Minnie, and Flash, who has a non-singing role,
star with Los Angeles Opera artistic director Placido Domingo in
Puccini's "The Girl of the Golden West," opening Wednesday at the
Music Center.</LD>
<TE>   Yet there is more than one stylish heroine on stage on this recent
night.</TE>
<TE>   Looking like yet another Minnie, conductor Simone Young holds
forth from the front of the stage, guiding pianist and singers
through sections of the score even as Malfitano and her mount make
their rounds. Like the soprano, she has long hair and wears a flowing
black dress. But her footwear is definitely not of the cowgirl
variety.</TE>
<TE>   On Young's feet are what must be the single most you-go-girl pair
of stilettos worn by a conductor, well, anywhere, ever. About 5
inches high, with metallic heels and leather straps adorned with
buckles, they've already become the talk of the building. "It's a bit
of a personal quirk," Young says of her passion for shoes, walking
impressively well on the delicate devices as she makes her way to a
rehearsal-break dinner.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the kind of unapologetic gesture that typifies the
personality of this woman who is not only an internationally
recognized conductor, but also the music and artistic director of
Opera Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I like better than a challenge and nothing I like
better than proving critics wrong," Young says. "So somebody says,
'No, you can't possibly do that,' that's just incentive for me to get
in there and do that. Maybe it's just the Irish in me."</TE>
<TE>   Even in 2002, going against the grain is often the lot of the
Minnies and Simone Youngs of the world--women who operate in realms
still overwhelmingly dominated by men. "It keeps coming up every time
I go to a new city and, once again, it's the first time they've had a
woman conducting," Young says. "For example, here. I hadn't realized
it's the first time you've had a woman conducting at the Los Angeles
Opera.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the first woman to conduct in both houses in Vienna, the
first woman to conduct in Munich at the opera and in Hamburg at the
opera and in Paris at the opera and just recently in Linz at the
Bruchner House," Young continues, reciting a litany obviously not for
the first time. "It surprises me every time. And yet, it shouldn't.
It's still the way of the world, and it's going to be a few years
before things change. It's a reality that's changing, but it's still
the contemporary reality."</TE>
<TE>   As Young's experience attests, such change typically happens one
person at a time. "The nice thing is I think I've got to the stage
where it's not really an issue as far as I'm concerned," she says.
"It's just about the work now. As anybody will tell you who works
with me, it makes absolutely no difference after the initial surprise
and the constant amusement at my shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Based on a 1905 play by American playwright and producer David
Belasco, Puccini's "The Girl of the Golden West" is set in a mythical
version of Gold Rush California. The picaresque tale follows Minnie,
whose heart is stolen by fugitive bandit Dick Johnson (Domingo, who
will share the role with Luis Lima), whom she redeems with her love.</TE>
<TE>   It's a work that admirers often acknowledge as something of a
guilty pleasure. "I adore it," Young says. "It's an absolutely
gorgeous score." But, she is quick to add, "it's problematic."</TE>
<TE>   The problems lie in the libretto's racial, ethnic and cultural
stereotypes. "It's the original spaghetti western, it really is,"
Young says. "It's a great story, it's just got some very strange
moments. The Italian-speaking Indians--they say 'ugh.' Actually its
'oog' in Italian. With contemporary sensibilities, some of that's a
little cringe-making. We have to make it as feasible and as belonging
to its time as is possible."</TE>
<TE>   While the opera is extremely accessible, there are several reasons
why it is not performed as often as, say, "Madame Butterfly" or
"Tosca." One is that it is more difficult to cast. "It takes a rare
combination of three exceptional principals," Young says. "You need
an exceptional woman as Minnie. She has to be able to do anything
vocally, from really soft to really big, up high to down low."</TE>
<TE>   There are many other aspects that make it deceptively difficult,
and pricey, for any company to stage. "It's a huge score in
orchestration, with quadruple rather than just triple winds," Young
explains. "You have a lot of soloists. It's a lot of difficult chorus
work to do. There's a lot of stage business that has to be there. You
have no idea how long a realistic fight in a bar takes to rehearse
when it has to fall in a specific musical framework."</TE>
<TE>   Difficult as the show may be, however, it holds a special place in
Young's memory. She recalls, "The irony for me is that it's the first
opera that I observed Opera Australia doing, 20 years ago, when I was
still a student."</TE>
<TE>   Now 41, and leader of that company, Young was born in Sydney and
educated in Catholic school there. "I went to convent school, all
girls, which was actually quite good," she recalls. "I was writing
musicals and putting them on myself, conducting from the piano. I was
conducting long before I realized that's what I was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Young attended New South Wales Conservatorium in Sydney. "I set
out to be a musician," she says. "I trained as a composer, but I was
kind of discouraged from doing it by my parents, because music was
viewed rather as a waste of brains. As a composer, I was the only
girl in the course, but hey, that was kind of fun. I'd won prizes and
scholarships as a high school student as a composer, so it seemed to
be that that was the way I was going to go."</TE>
<TE>   Young didn't formally decide to become a conductor, at least not
while at the conservatory. It wasn't until she left, and even then it
wasn't something she decided, but more a choice that evolved.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw in my studies and started teaching myself," she says. "I
left the conservatorium and worked for various amateur opera and
musical groups, and very soon discovered that I knew a whole lot more
about it than the guy who was at the front waving the baton."</TE>
<TE>   Young soon took over a few of these amateur groups, and that
became her first real conducting experience. She assumed she would
become an assistant conductor--a pianist who works in opera and works
with singers. "And that's what I started doing," she says, "but at
the same time I was doing all this amateur conducting and that was
how I got into it."</TE>
<TE>   Young got her first job as an assistant conductor at Opera
Australia when she was 22. Only three years later, the big moment
that all show business aspirants dream of came her way.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a day in 1985 when the chorus master"--who was
conducting--"fell ill and I was the best person on the spot to take
over the show," she recalls. "So I stepped in at a few hours' notice
and made my opera house debut in Sydney with 'The Mikado,' an
operetta, at Opera Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at the end of that performance that I stepped out of the
pit, having conducted the performance, thinking, you know, this is
really where I feel most at home," Young says.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt confident that this was really what I wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Now she's in charge. Since January 2001, when Young became
artistic director, she has been responsible for making all artistic
decisions for the company, which is based in Sydney and Melbourne,
and which has an annual operating budget of about $29.8 million. The
company presents 20 operas a year and more than 200 performances.
"It's a huge organization: two cities, two orchestras, two choruses,"
says Young, who also served as the music director of the Bergen
Philharmonic Orchestra in Germany from 1999 to 2002. "And that's why
I've cut back on my foreign engagements."</TE>
<TE>   In the top job at a company for more than a year now, Young has
gained perspective, even looking back on her own big break. "Would I
have given a 24-year-old that opportunity--forget male or female? I
guess if I had been confident in the kid's ability, I would have. But
it was actually quite a big call."</TE>
<TE>   A call well made, judging from how things have gone for her since.
The year after that debut, Young received a grant that took her to
Europe to observe conductors and work with other companies. "That was
a fantastic year of studies that I spent in Paris and Cologne and a
little bit in London, watching some of the best and some of the worst
rehearsals I've ever seen and learning a lot from both," she says.
"Cologne offered me a job, and that was when, in mid-1987, I moved to
Europe and started six years with Cologne opera." That led to a
series of debuts in key European houses in the early 1990s in such
cities as Berlin, Vienna and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   She has cut back her opera conducting to the point where she is
doing little outside Australia until 2004. In part, that's because of
the tremendous demands of running Opera Australia. In part, it's to
accommodate the rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Her family lives in the United Kingdom, and she divides her time,
as is typical of someone in her line of work, among home, Australia
and where her conducting takes her. "We try to set a limit of four
weeks," says Young, who has been married for 20 years to a high
school language teacher--a "civilian"--and with whom she has 5-and
14-year-old daughters. "We spend more than half the year together,
which is not bad going. It's not ideal, but it's one of the juggles
that you have to do if you want to be in this business.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be considered perfectly normal and a reasonable way of
life for a man," she says, with a twinkle in her blue-gray eyes and
her well-shod feet firmly on the ground. "But it's extremely unusual
for a woman."</TE>

<DH>The 8-foot statue of the Virgin Mary atop the new
cathedral's doors was crafted with today's Angelenos in mind</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She could be the woman piloting the No. 3 bus along Sunset Boulevard,
the one who served you lunch today in Little Tokyo or wiped your brow
as you lay in a Boyle Heights hospital bed. She could even be that
statuesque supermodel type--those sinewy arms, those lofty
cheekbones!--breezing by on the Santa Monica Promenade.</LD>
<LD>   Her expression is demure, but her stance is powerful and direct,
like an athlete's. Her eyes are cast downward but her shoulders are
broad, and her oversized hands look strong and capable--appropriate
for a woman whose image has led armies into battle and seized the
imagination of entire continents.</LD>
<LD>   Down through the centuries she has gone by many different names:
The Virgin of Pomata. The Virgin of Montserrat. The Divine
Shepherdess. The sorrowful Mater Dolorosa, grieving for her Son,
depicted in Michelangelo's Pieta. La Virgen de Guadalupe, a.k.a. Our
Lady of the Americas, who revealed herself not to the rich and
powerful, but to the Indian peasant Juan Diego. The formidable
Madonna of the Apocalypse, destined to help rid mankind of Satan.</LD>
<TE>   She's certainly no stranger to Los Angeles, where her image adorns
garage walls and Pico-Union tiendas, front-yard grottoes and roadside
shrines. Her character and deeds have been celebrated by artists as
dissimilar as Botticelli and Chris Ofili, Bach and the Beatles, while
sightings of her inspire pilgrimages to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in her latest manifestation, serene and self-contained,
floating above the Great Bronze Doors at the entrance to the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, she seems to be all these women
and many more besides. A woman for the ages, favored by God above all
others, but also a woman specifically of 21st century Los Angeles. A
homegirl. One of us.</TE>
<TE>   "She has to be one of us," says artist Robert Graham, puffing a
cigar as he gazes up at his 8-foot-tall creation, ablaze in the
morning sunlight. "I think that throughout all the representations of
the Virgin goddess, there has always been the recognition that each
one of those has been of the time and of the people."</TE>
<TE>   Which raises a question, pondered deeply over the last several
years by Graham, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and other movers and
shakers behind the $200-million cathedral complex, which will be
formally dedicated Monday:</TE>
<TE>   What should be the attributes of this thoroughly modern Virgin?
What qualities do you ascribe to a woman mentioned only fleetingly in
the New Testament, as well as in the Koran, who has inspired
monarchs, artists and theologians for two millenniums? A woman whose
picture is instantly recognizable to millions, but who lacks a
codified image?</TE>
<TE>   In an essay about Graham's statue and the Great Bronze Doors, Jack
Miles, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "God: A Biography,"
writes that the Virgin "is like a miraculously talented actress who
discovers something new within herself wherever she performs by
drawing theatrical power from each successive audience."</TE>
<TE>   That metaphor might strike some believers as irreverent. Yet the
15 different incarnations of the Virgin depicted on Graham's bronze
doors illustrate the myriad ways in which Mary has been imagined, the
roles she has played, among them the "Black Madonna" of Montserrat,
Catalonia, in Spain, and the Virgin of Loreto, in Italy, surrounded
by the words of an incantatory prayer listing her various
titles--Holy Mother of God, Vessel of Honor, Ark of the Covenant,
Morning Star, Refuge of Sinners.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, many of the images chosen for the door were
imported by Spanish conquistadors and missionaries to the colonies of
the New World. Some were adopted wholesale by the colonized. Others
were transformed by contact with the indigenous peoples of the
Americas, who alchemically combined them with likenesses of their own
earth-mother goddesses and female deities.</TE>
<TE>   These images should have particular resonance with worshipers in
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, where one of every six U.S. Latino
Catholics resides. They also provide a historical foundation for the
ethnically indeterminate features of Graham's statue, a regal mestizo
beauty who embodies certain qualities of her iconographic ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   In his essay, Miles suggests that, "at the risk of caricature,"
Graham's statue "may be said to have a Caucasian nose, Asian eyes,
African lips, and straight, coarse hair worn in a thick Native
American braid." How else should the patroness of America's most
ethnically scrambled city look?</TE>
<TE>   But the implications of the statue's appearance go way beyond a
politically sensitive act of cultural affirmation.</TE>
<TE>   By awarding the Virgin a central place in the cathedral's
narrative, the archdiocese is keeping faith with a long, if
fluctuating, Catholic and Orthodox tradition of devotion to Our Lady,
a tradition enjoying a resurgence under Pope John Paul II. (The
pope's personal motto, "Totus tuus sum, Maria," or "I am all yours,
Mary," reflects his belief that the Virgin intervened to save his
life from an assassin's bullet in 1981 so that he could help defeat
European communism.)</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the Virgin Mary hasn't always been an essential
thread in the Christian narrative, says Jaroslav Pelikan, an emeritus
history professor at Yale and author of "Mary Through the Centuries."
Possibly because explicit references to her in the New Testament are
relatively scant, it wasn't until AD 431 that the church even
officially recognized Mary as the mother of God. As late as the third
century, there was "no trace of belief in Mary's assumption into
heaven," Pelikan writes.</TE>
<TE>   Over the centuries, the worship of Mary has drifted in and out of
fashion, sometimes regarded as a fitting tribute to the mother of
God, other times as a potential threat to the theological supremacy
of the Trinity. Marian cults have flourished, then mysteriously
faded.</TE>
<TE>   Medieval women particularly identified with Mary's humility,
Pelikan writes, "but also with her defiance and with her victory." In
modern times, the Virgin has been a figurehead for Third World
liberation movements and a lightning rod for feminists. Simone de
Beauvoir, in her classic "The Second Sex," claimed that Mary's
subjugation to Jesus in Christian theology relegated women worldwide
to "inferiority" status.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, the Virgin's symbolic potency makes her a provocative,
sometimes controversial figure. Earlier this summer, the Rev. Rowan
Williams, the new archbishop of Canterbury, head of Britain's
Anglican Church, was accused of idolatry for encouraging devotion to
the Virgin Mary. A sculptural installation by contemporary artist
Robert Gober, which featured a statue of the Virgin with a culvert
pipe piercing her midsection, practically touched off a riot when it
was shown a few years ago at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, every generation and culture seem able to find a Mary
suited to their own tastes and preoccupations. "By one of the most
dramatic reversals in the history of ideas," writes Pelikan, "this
humble peasant girl from Nazareth has been made the subject of some
of the most sublime and even extravagant theological speculation ever
thought up."</TE>
<TE>   It was far from a given that Mary would grace the new cathedral's
entrance, according to some accounts. Initially, essayist Miles says,
plans had called for a statue of Jesus in that exalted position.
Later, the cardinal suggested that Mary, as the cathedral's namesake,
ought to have a prominent role in Spanish architect Jose Rafael
Moneo's elegant modernist design.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it was apparently some time before Mary emerged as the
undisputed central figure in Graham's sculptural composition. One
early version of the work had Mary with the infant Jesus set across
her breast. Another called for flanking the Virgin with two angels.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, it was decided that symbolism, language and local
historical context dictated a different concept of this singular
woman, who lent her name to the settlement founded here in her honor
in 1781: El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora,  la Reina de los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "By having her without the flanking angels, it's an allusion that
she's Our Lady of Los Angeles," Graham says, giving the last two
words their Spanish pronunciation, with the long o and the soft g.
"We are the city of Los Angeles, and she's our patron." And we,
Graham says, are her angels.</TE>
<TE>   Graham says he finds it difficult to discuss his thought process
in creating the work, or to analyze the challenges of the
high-profile commission he reportedly lobbied hard to get. "I got a
really good model and closed my eyes and just hoped it came out all
right," he said during a public forum at the Skirball Cultural Center
earlier this summer. The process of mold-making, casting and
fabricating the work took place over roughly two years, and involved
three foundries.</TE>
<TE>   Graham, 64, is a longtime resident of Venice Beach, where he lives
with his wife, actress Anjelica Huston. His pieces are scattered
through the city, most prominent among them "Olympic Gateway," a pair
of headless, heroic male and female nudes, which marks the entrance
to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and was commissioned for the
1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the best-known figurative sculptor working in the United
States today, he has won commissions for several large civic
projects, including "Monument to Joe Louis" (1986) in downtown
Detroit, a section of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (1997)
in Washington, and "Duke Ellington Memorial" (1997) just north of New
York City's Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   Graham says an artist's identity shouldn't matter in the greater
scheme of monumental works designed to last generations. "The
majority of these landmarks we pay attention to are anonymous, or
without authority," he says. "In order to do it, you really do have
to relinquish your authority."</TE>
<TE>   However, he has permitted himself one autobiographical footnote in
the Great Bronze Doors: The image of the Virgin of the Rosary of
Chichinquira, from Colombia, includes a replica of his mother's
rosary.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mexico City in 1938, Graham was raised Catholic and
attended Catholic schools there and in the U.S., where his family
later moved. The Virgin of Guadalupe was a presence in his life
practically from infancy. "You can't get away from the Virgin in
Mexico," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Graham acknowledges that "research was very important" in his
approach to the project. To learn more about how the Virgin imagery
has evolved historically, he visited museums and libraries, and pored
over books like Carol Damian's "The Virgin of the Andes: Art and
Ritual in Colonial Cuzco."</TE>
<TE>   That knowledge is distilled into the 15 virginal manifestations
that grace roughly the top two-thirds of the inner doors. Below them,
40 smaller icons represent faiths preceding Christianity and include
an I Ching symbol, Celtic serpents and a condor symbol popular with
the Chumash people who once inhabited Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Fogelman, assistant director for education and interpretive
programs at the J. Paul Getty Museum and author of an essay on the
Great Bronze Doors' historical antecedents, says the "multiplicity"
of Graham's imagery allows cathedral visitors to approach the Virgin
and the faith through various symbolic points of entry.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, she says, "some people, because of their personal
experience, have a more immediate response to the Virgin of Sorrows,
like they can relate to that aspect of losing a son, that very human
aspect of the Virgin."</TE>
<TE>   The inner doors are contained in two outer doors that assume the
shape of inverted Ls. Together, the 25-ton doors function as a kind
of vertical mobile sculpture. "I really think Robert's narrative
articulates exactly what those doors ought to be," says Richard S.
Vosko, a priest and religious scholar who was the archdiocese's
liturgical and public art consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Hovering 20 feet above the cathedral plaza, the statue of Our Lady
is set within a gold T-shaped section of the tympanum, a rectangular
area above the doors. The tympanum is scored with three horizontal
lines that, according to Miles' essay, represent the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. A halo of natural light, created by a large
opening in the tympanum, surrounds her head.</TE>
<TE>   Her feet are bare, as are her long, graceful arms, and she wears
no headdress--one of several striking departures from traditional
medieval and Renaissance images of Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Her palms are turned outward, as if welcoming worshippers into the
house of God, and she stands on a crescent moon, an allusion to the
description in Revelation 12:1 of a woman presumed to be Mary,
"clothed in the sun with the moon under her foot." Some observers
have told Graham that the statue's powerful bearing puts them in mind
of another strong, devout female servant of God: Joan of Arc.</TE>
<TE>   The Virgin's appearance, including her clothing, received much
attention not only from Graham, but from the cardinal and his board
of cathedral advisors. (Though there appears to have been a lively
give-and-take on some issues, Graham says he doesn't have any
complaints about his relations with church officials: "I was given
the liberty to work without interference.")</TE>
<TE>   According to a footnote in Miles' essay, "in an early model, the
Virgin wore sandals and long sleeves; but to the consternation of
some, both had disappeared when a scale model of the doors was
displayed at a fund-raising dinner on May 24, 1999."</TE>
<TE>   The essay quotes from a letter written by Mahony to Graham in
which the cardinal stated that "some cautions are being raised by
members of our Cathedral Advisory Board over the final form and
appearance of the statue."</TE>
<TE>   In reply, Graham wrote to Vosko, noting that the "concept of
garments in sacred images always follows cultural and geographical
conventions of their time," and that the statue's garments "reflect
current ideas of clothing of the coming 21st century," including
suitability to a warm climate and "utter simplicity."</TE>
<TE>   Graham went on to note the unusual properties of Mary's long,
almost mystically wrinkle-free tunic, contributing to her aura of
placidity. "Her grandeur is in its simplicity in context with the
heavenly plane of the tympanum," Graham wrote. "This I feel would be
debased by adding ersatz regal trappings or other 'fancy' ornaments
to Her garments."</TE>
<TE>   Fogelman, of the Getty Museum, says that "to me, actually, the
most powerful thing" about Graham's statue is that the Virgin's arms
are bare. "There's a kind of immediacy and maybe even accessibility
that her bared arms kind of imply," she says.</TE>
<TE>   These issues, part aesthetic and part liturgical, relate to a
broader question: Should the statue and the doors be considered art?
"It isn't art," Graham insists, "because I don't know what art is.
It's a door to the cathedral, and it's a door that represents
Catholic content to the Catholic community. It's not art in the same
way that a Buddha wouldn't be art to a Buddhist. It's a Buddha!"</TE>
<TE>   Chuckling, he lights up another cigar.</TE>
<TE>   So who exactly is the woman behind the woman who will embody the
spiritual aspirations of several million people, now and in centuries
to come? (For the record, she's reported to be a local model of mixed
Anglo and Latino descent.)</TE>
<TE>   Graham would clearly prefer that her identity not be made public.
"The model was just the beginning of the piece," he says. "But by the
time it's finished, it's not either me or the model that comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, a little mystery won't hurt Our Lady; it never has.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, Graham, Miles, Fogelman and the cardinal were at
an evening reception and book-signing in the new cathedral's
courtyard. Among the guests nibbling hors d'oeuvres and sipping wine
and soft drinks as they milled about the plaza was John R. Williams,
an associate with Leo A Daly construction firm.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Mexican-Japanese mother and a Welsh-French-English
father, Williams said he was pleased by the statue's appearance. "I
can look at her one way and see a Northern European woman, then when
you're up close I see more of the Latino, Hispanic background," he
observed. "We're so used to seeing paintings of her with a European
look, and I'd never understand that, with her being from the Middle
East."</TE>
<TE>   A few yards away, Graham was busily greeting friends while
patiently signing book after book. Night was falling across the city.
The moon had not yet risen.</TE>
<TE>   But at the center of the party, illuminated from below, Our Lady
of Los Angeles watched over her new home, a point of light in the
darkness.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: A Multitude of Virgins--On the Great Bronze Doors,
sculpted by Robert Graham, 15 manifestations of the Virgin show how
her image has evolved through different times and cultures. 1. Virgin
of Pomata: The "mountainous" shape of the Virgin's skirts suggests
the Inca mountain goddess Pachamama. 2. Ex Voto to Virgin of
Guadalupe: This offering shows a mother and child kneeling before the
Virgin of Guadalupe. 3. Apocalyptic Virgin/Immaculate Conception: The
winged Virgin cited in Revelation 12 crushes a serpent representing
Satan. 4. Divine Shepherdess: The image was inspired by the Virgin's
appearance to a Spanish monk. 5.Virgin of Guadalupe: Framed by the
sun's rays and thornless roses, as she appeared to Indian peasant

<DH>A museum display and a film fest mark Marlene Dietrich's
100th birthday</DH>

<LD>They had faces back then, during the golden age of Hollywood when
actors and actresses were almost surreally beautiful. And one of the
most perfect faces to grace the silver screen belonged to German-born
Marlene Dietrich. A rival to Swedish beauty Greta Garbo, Dietrich
starred in such lush melodramas as "Morocco" and "Shanghai Express,"
which she made with her mentor and amour Josef von Sternberg, along
with such musical comedies as "Destry Rides Again." As followers of
the blond, blue-eyed star well know, Dietrich had countless lovers of
both sexes--Jean Gabin, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Erich Maria
Remarque, to name a few--while remaining married to the same man
(Rudolf Sieber) for 50 years. But few know that Dietrich was also a
pack rat. In fact, she needed a warehouse to store her pictures,
mementos from lovers, letters, clothes and other memorabilia.</LD>
<TE>   After Dietrich's death in Paris in 1992, her estate treasures were
purchased for $5 million by the Film Museum Berlin. Items from the
estate are on permanent display at the museum, but for her 100th
birthday last December, the museum created a special exhibition,
"Marlene Dietrich: Forever Young," which features 120 pieces and
spans four decades. The exhibition opens Thursday at the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum--the only North American engagement of the
artifacts. The exhibition is co-sponsored by the Goethe Institute Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the exhibition, which continues through Dec.
1, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's film department is
celebrating Dietrich's career with a two-month festival, "The Devil
Is an Angel."</TE>
<TE>   "The concept behind the exhibit is that this is Marlene's 100th
birthday party, and the guests have all been invited and each object
is attached in some way to a guest," says Jan-Christopher Horak,
curator of the Hollywood Entertainment Museum. "A guest is someone
who is important to Marlene's life. Each guest is represented by one,
two or three objects."</TE>
<TE>   Those objects include correspondence, love letters, even a bright
circus director's outfit she wore when performing in Las Vegas.
"There is a lace bra from Dior ... I guess he dressed her a lot,"
Horak says. "There is a letter from Edith Piaf ... Orson Welles is
represented through a letter.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other interesting curios are items from fans, friends
and co-workers: a pillow from Robert Redford, a record from Frank
Sinatra--'This Is Sinatra'-- and a bracelet he apparently gave her, a
fan letter from George Bush Sr., a fan letter from Richard Nixon, and
photo from Nancy and Ronald Reagan."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit also includes a multimedia area of her film and
concert work, Horak says, "as well as the people--men and women--who
have paid homage to her, especially her role in 'The Blue Angel' " as
the sultry and tawdry garter-belt-clad cabaret singer Lola Lola.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone from Liza Minnelli in 'Cabaret' to Helmut Berger in 'The
Damned' and all the other ones who did the 'Blue Angel' shtick. She
has this very androgynous character and screen persona. Men and women
both fell in love with her."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit is meant to be fun, says Werner Sudendorf, curator of
the Marlene Dietrich estate collection at the Berlin museum. "You
rarely see Marlene laughing," he says. "She is always very straight
and disciplined, so we made a photographic section where you see her
partying with other people, drinking and things like that. On the
other side of the coin, you have all the glamour photography, the
poses and the perfection."</TE>
<TE>   Born Dec. 27, 1901, in Berlin, Dietrich--the daughter of an Army
officer who died when she was 11--was musically inclined from a young
age, playing the piano and violin. At 20, she was accepted into Max
Reinhardt's acting school and made her film debut in "Napoleon's
Younger Brother" in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the decade, she had starred in several silent films.
She became an overnight international sensation in the 1930 German
drama "The Blue Angel," directed by Von Sternberg. A zaftig Dietrich
gave an indelible performance as Lola Lola, a cabaret singer who
marries a timid schoolteacher. The film, in which she introduced the
song "Falling in Love Again," brought Von Sternberg and Dietrich to
Hollywood and Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   She received her only Oscar nomination for her role as a cabaret
singer who falls for legionnaire Gary Cooper in "Morocco" in 1930.
The Dietrich-Von Sternberg collaboration also produced such hits as
the 1932 films "Shanghai Express" and "Blonde Venus." In the latter,
she performs the number "Hot Voodoo" wearing a gorilla outfit. By the
end of the decade, though, she along with Greta Garbo and Katharine
Hepburn were considered box office poison.</TE>
<TE>   Dietrich staged her comeback in 1939, playing a dance hall girl,
Frenchy, in the boisterous Western comedy "Destry Rides Again," in
which she sang "See What the Boys in the Backroom Will Have."</TE>
<TE>   Appalled by Hitler's rise in her beloved Germany, she became a
U.S. citizen in the late '30s and worked tirelessly for her new
country. Dietrich spent nearly three years during World War II
entertaining Allied troops in Europe. Because of her stance then,
many of her countrymen considered her a traitor and she was treated
poorly in Germany when she arrived there to perform in the late '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Dietrich's film roles were few and far between when she returned
to the States after the war, though she did land great parts in such
films as Billy Wilder's "A Foreign Affair" (1948), Fritz Lang's
"Rancho Notorious" (1952); Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution"
(1957); and Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).</TE>
<TE>   When the film roles dried up, she reinvented herself once again,
this time as a successful international cabaret performer. After she
broke her leg on tour in 1975, she retired and lived in self-exile in
Paris until her death.</TE>
<TE>   "The Devil Is an Angel" film festival opens Sept. 26 with "The
Blue Angel," and her last film with Von Sternberg, "The Devil Is a
Woman" (1935). Other films to be screened include "Morocco" with "The
Garden of Allah" (1936), "Shanghai Express," "Blonde Venus," "The
Scarlet Empress" (1934), "Angel" (1937) and "Destry Rides Again."</TE>
<TE>   "What we remember most are the films she did with Von Sternberg,"
Sudendorf says, "and what she did in those films that was remarkable
was that she used power, the power of an experienced woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Adolphe Menjou in 'Morocco' asks her, 'Do you need any help?' and
she doesn't answer at once. She looks at him. It is the power of
silence, and you start thinking, 'What's going on in her mind?' Then
she says, 'I don't need any help.' She's alone in Morocco and she
doesn't need any help. So she must be something special."</TE>
<TE>   Dietrich "is not the one who falls in love instantly" in the Von
Sternberg films, he says. "She is always a self-protecting woman. I
think that is the figure that is burnt in our mind and how she
survived so many bad films."</TE>
<TE>   Although Dietrich always maintained that she did very few decent
films, Horak says he believes at least half a dozen of her films were
great. Her legacy has endured for 70 years, he says, "partially
because she was in good movies by great directors. They are films
that continue to be shown on television. When you see them you go,
'Ah ... there is something about her.' "</TE>

<LD>Suzanne Muchnic's article on the Getty's reconstructed frame was
fascinating, but her reference to "a wide-brimmed hat and a trio of
swords" merits elaboration because it involves specifics of church
history ("The Frame of a Lifetime," Aug. 25).</LD>
<LD>   The "trio" is actually one sword, a bishop's crosier and a
two-barred Episcopal cross, both of which were used in the liturgical
functions of the sitter. The "hat" is actually an armorial device
used in coats-of-arms of bishops and cardinals to this day. The
number of tassels indicates the status of the cleric: Archbishops
have more than bishops; cardinals more than all.</LD>

<LD>Reader D.W. Jenks seems to have heard rumors about downtown living
but doesn't appear to have actually investigated those rumors
(Letters, Aug. 25).</LD>
<LD>   Jenks asks if there are plans for a supermarket. Escrow has closed
on a property that is expected to become a Ralphs or Albertson's;
meantime, there are smaller markets that can provide just about
everything one needs.</LD>
<LD>   Are there plans for new department stores? Probably not--those we
already have.</LD>
<TE>   Same goes for doctors and dentists. The "frosting" to which Jenks
refers is what makes downtown living so appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Other communities also have the conveniences listed above--but how
many can boast of free weekly concerts from all over the world, lots
of live theater, fantastic museums, architecture to die for, a wealth
of cultures--and cheap and easy public transit?</TE>
<TE>   I agree that people who work in Santa Clarita probably shouldn't
move down here (I don't know why they'd even want to). But for those
who work on the Westside, it's a quick commute, and those in the
Valley can take the subway or Metrolink very easily. Metrolink trains
run as far as Oxnard, actually.</TE>
<TE>   It's disappointing that after so much good press, downtown is
still perceived so incorrectly by the majority of Los Angeles, and
people continue to perpetuate the "ghost town at sundown" stereotype.
There is a vibrant community growing every day, and I for one am
delighted to be a part of it.</TE>

<LD>In Don Shirley's CD review ("Broadway Old, New and Imaginary," Aug.
25), he notes, "Irving Berlin's 'Supper Time' from the 1933 show 'As
Thousands Cheer' is a raw lament by an abandoned wife and mother."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, her husband has been lynched. Shirley is obviously too
young to recall that in 1933, there were 42 known lynchings in the
South. "Supper Time" was Berlin's denunciation of mob violence for a
scene of Ethel Waters in a broken-down Southern shack setting a
dinner table for her kids--"that man of mine ain't comin' home no
more." The curtain rose to the headline "Unknown Negro Lynched by
Frenzied Mob."</LD>

it's too bad no recording of the 1999 L.A. Reprise! production is
available.</TE>
<TE>   But there are two other superb recordings on CD. The best, a 1997
truly excellent DRG recording with uniformly outstanding performances
by Davis Gaines, Rebecca Luker, Debbie Gravitte and others, is as
good a musical comedy recording as you'll find anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite as good but still excellent: the Sony Broadway recording
of a 1953 LP with Jack Cassidy, Portia Nelson, Bibi Osterwald and

<HD>In Defense of Cher</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Hilburn's Perspective on Cher amounts to hot air and would be
nullified by the vast majority of those in attendance at her farewell
show at Staples ("Written Off ... Unfairly?," Aug. 18). An air of
excitement, joy and hope filled the venue as thousands jumped to
their feet as the very professional production showed us a
run-through of a great entertainer's long career.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe she is not Streisand, but the girl entertains and adapts to
the times as few can do. If Hilburn got excited during only one song,
he probably should have skipped the show and let another person
experience the totally satisfying stage show.</LD>
<LD>   For a critic, and a longtime one at that, a little more
versatility and appreciation of more than just great voices might
serve him and the public better.</LD>
<TE>   RONALD L. WALLACE</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Cher's defense, because she doesn't usually write or play an
instrument, she's always been at the mercy of the record label and
producer to pick her material and point her in a direction.
Hopefully, one that sells records. Hilburn did say that Phil Spector
"gave it a go" and nobody cared. I remember the same thing happened
to Bobby Darin, in that he tried to make the transition with "If I
Were a Carpenter." The younger people to whom he was trying to appeal
didn't really accept him, and his fan base wanted to hear "Mack the
Knife." How's this for an idea: Why not have Chrissie Hynde produce
the next Cher album?</TE>
<TE>   JAMES HOLVAY</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn must be having a midlife crisis. Either that or he
had a bad seat at Staples Center, bad day, bad week or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   That was about the fifth time I'd seen Cher in concert, and you
know she's still great. Old stuff and new, all of it is great.</TE>
<TE>   You could never compare Cher to our other diva, Chrissie Hynde.
Chrissie has her own style and Cher too. The Pretenders and Chrissie
were fine for their length of time, but Cher has been around way
longer--an icon.</TE>
<TE>   Chrissie has her own style of rock, especially when you go back to
the "Chain Gang" music video; she was very courageous to show herself
pregnant. As for Cher, back in the day you could say it was soft rock
'n' roll, which led to bigger and better things. Hilburn didn't

<DH>'The Danube Exodus' succeeds in the friction between
factual documents and images of two WWII river journeys</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Danube Exodus," an intensely absorbing exhibition, is also a
history lesson, a meditation on time and loss, a deep sensory soak
and a struggle. What causes the friction is also what generates the
most provocative of the show's unanswered questions, centering on how
history is made, processed and understood.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Forgacs created the installation for the Getty Research
Institute in collaboration with the Getty and the Labyrinth Project
at USC's Annenberg Center for Communication. Forgacs' 1997 film of
the same name served as the springboard for the show, which examines
two journeys along the Danube, one made in 1939 by Eastern European
Jews fleeing Nazi forces for Palestine, and the other made in 1940 by
Bessarabian Germans being repatriated after Bessarabia (present-day
Moldova and part of Ukraine) was occupied by the Soviets. The
journeys were in opposite directions, a year apart, but one captain,
Nandor Andrasovits, helped ferry the illicit Jewish exodus and the
government-sponsored Bessarabian one. With an 8-millimeter movie
camera that he used to document life along the Danube, Andrasovits
filmed both sets of passengers on their fateful journeys.</LD>
<TE>   The Getty exhibition consists of two basic parts: a film montage
using period footage by Andrasovits and others, and a wealth of
didactic information in the form of maps, albums, text, diaries and
computer stations serving as portals to yet more. The thrust of the
Getty Research Institute is represented beautifully by this melding
of disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   In the first gallery, a timeline tracks the Jewish exodus from
left to right across the wall and a chronology of the Bessarabian
German exodus moves from right to left just beneath it. The flow of
time and the flow of the river begin to conflate here, in defiance of
a single, unified course.</TE>
<TE>   The Danube, which begins in Germany's Black Forest and ends in the
Black Sea, passes through nearly a dozen countries along its
1,770-mile course. Forgacs situates the river linguistically through
a listing of its names in different languages and geographically
through numerous hand-drawn maps. Most are the product of an 18th
century Bolognese count, who compiled a six-volume encyclopedia on
the Danube's topography, the everyday life of its fishermen, its
flora and fauna, fossils and tides.</TE>
<TE>   Forgacs compares the count's hunger for knowledge about the river
with Andrasovits' gathering of data on film, and with his own
persistent working and reworking of Danube stories.</TE>
<TE>   This multifaceted introduction to the Danube gives way, in the
second part of the exhibition, to an experience of the river based
primarily on sensation rather than information. In a darkened room,
Forgacs projects footage onto a broad arch of five contiguous screens
stretching across one long wall.</TE>
<TE>   A single image occasionally spans all five screens at once. More
often, images appear one to a screen, repeating, alternating and
mirroring each other to vivid effect. The black-and-white footage is
toned blue, gold or rust, and the combinations create an additional
dynamic rhythm across the screens.</TE>
<TE>   We see passengers dancing, praying and enjoying the sun, towns
along the shore, rolling waves and cloudy skies, all spliced into
fragments, slowed to a pensive pace and woven together into a richly
textured patchwork of impressions. Tibor Szemzo's score is haunting
in its mix of solemn music, foghorns, bells, the beat of marching
soldiers, the occasional voice and the rush of water.</TE>
<TE>   For all of the clean linearity and continuity of the show's
didactic section, the film component is luxuriously discontinuous and
provocatively incomplete. It's made even more overtly nonlinear by
the ability of visitors to choose the order of segments by
touch-screen.</TE>
<TE>   Joined in the exhibition, then, are two vastly different modes of
organizing meaning--through specific data such as dates, maps and
names, and through a more vague network of images, triggered memories
and sensory response.</TE>
<TE>   Neither component of the show, alone, would suffice. Together,
they make an uneasy pair, but their friction is productive. It's the
very struggle of forces that ensues in the writing and understanding
of history. What we know rubs up against what we sense or intuit;
what we can comfortably grasp chafes against what consistently eludes
us; what holds true in words challenges what we glean from
experience.</TE>
<TE>   The words of Heraclitus appear on a gallery wall and throughout
the installation are brought home: "Everything is in constant flux
and movement ... nothing is abiding ... Therefore, we cannot step
twice into the same river. When I step into the river for the second
time, neither I nor the river is the same."</TE>
<TE>   As a metaphor for historical narrative, the river serves well.
Fluid and alive, it continuously changes over time, as different
questions are asked and different people do the asking. Questions,
rather than answers, are at the heart of that river, that process.</TE>
<TE>   Forgacs' installation abounds in them. What, for instance,
motivated Andrasovits to work the river both ways, to aid passengers
on both sides of a political divide? And what was the status of
Bessarabian Germans who weren't among the 93,000 transported back to
Germany--those, for example, who couldn't provide the solid Aryan
credentials required? We know what befell Eastern European Jews not
lucky enough to be among the roughly 1,000 to catch a ride down the
Danube to survival.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions that hover, stickily, over this show, is
whether the parallel that Forgacs poses between the sets of
passengers is true, fair, instructive. It's a troubling one, because
it disrupts easy assumptions of German guilt. Although the men
transported back to Germany from Bessarabia were conscripted into the
German military to fight for the Third Reich, at the time of their
Danube exodus, they were not perpetrators but victims, uprooted and
forced to give up nearly everything they had.</TE>
<TE>   Forgacs brings together the stories of the two journeys and leaves
them, side by side as well as visually intertwined, allowing us to
draw our own conclusions. His methods are viscerally compelling. The
installation immerses us in sound and imagery of tremendous emotional
resonance, sweeping us along in its powerful current. Where it
delivers us is another, individual matter.</TE>

<DH>Jose Rafael Moneo's cathedral design echoes great churches
of the past</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles finally has a spiritual heart. That's the assumption, at
least, behind the monumental new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.
But exactly what kind of spiritual heart is it?</LD>
<LD>   Rising at the corner of downtown's Grand Avenue and Temple Street,
the cathedral's stark concrete form stands at the intersection of the
city's cultural future. Its enormous footprint--1 foot longer than
Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral--ranks it among the largest
cathedrals in America. Its towering facade, with its dynamic
cross-shaped altar window, looms over a vast plaza that is clearly
intended as a communal focal point in a city that has few.</LD>
<LD>   But the cathedral's ambitions are far more sweeping. Designed by
Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo, it aims to pick up the
historical thread that stretches back through centuries of church
design and tie it to the present. To do so, Moneo drew on a range of
traditional precedents. He then reworked them for a contemporary
world. The result is a structure steeped in memory and yet wholly
new.</LD>
<TE>   There has never been a fixed formula for designing churches, and
debates about their ideal form have raged through centuries.</TE>
<TE>   What we often think of as the typical Roman Catholic church
evolved during early Christianity and the Romanesque period, when the
Latin cross plan--with its central nave and shorter transept--was
first conceived as a representation of the crucifixion of Christ. It
reached its apogee in great Gothic cathedrals like Chartres or Notre
Dame, which were seen as the physical embodiment of Christ, the link
between God and man. The soaring vertical lines of columns, pilasters
and buttresses drew the eye up to the heavens, and, just as
important, signaled the presence of the divine on earth.</TE>
<TE>   But medieval cathedrals, built up over centuries, were often a
patchwork of inconsistent styles, a fact that is summed up by
Chartres' oddly mismatched spires--one built in the 12th century, the
other, taller and more intricately detailed, built after a fire more
than 250 years later.</TE>
<TE>   To the Renaissance mind, such disorder was incapable of expressing
the harmony of God's universe with real clarity. In the 15th century
architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Donato d'Agnolo Bramante
and, later, Michelangelo began to articulate an aesthetic based on
Platonic forms. Alberti, in particular, devised a system of geometric
proportions that were remarkably modern in spirit. The dome,
meanwhile, became the embodiment of cosmic order and purity.</TE>
<TE>   Such advances produced a philosophical rupture in how churches
should be designed. Pope Carlo Borromeo condemned the circle as a
pagan form in about 1572 and urged a return to the Latin cross plan.
But as Renaissance scholar Rudolf Wittkower pointed out, architects
continued to push the boundaries of church design. And during the
next few centuries, many of the great churches and cathedrals were an
attempt to resolve the conflict between these two forms--the Latin
cross and the centralized dome--and their symbolic meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere was that struggle more visible than in the construction of
St. Peter's Basilica. The seat of the Vatican was designed by
Bramante in the early part of the 16th century in a Greek cross plan,
with four symmetrical bays. Antonio da Sangallo proposed adding a
long nave, which would have destroyed the basilica's symmetry.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Michelangelo reasserted the design's cohesion, emphasizing
the structure's vertical lines to unify the body of the basilica with
the dome. Finally, Carlo Maderno returned to the Latin cross plan,
lengthening the nave and completing the St. Peter's design seen
today.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, others were pushing such ideas a step forward. In
Venice's Il Redentore, Andrea Palladio anchored a central nave with a
bulbous dome. Seen from the main entry, the interior's vaulted nave
dominates the view, and only as you move farther into the building
does the relationship between the nave and the domed space become
apparent. Relating the notion of unity to movement through space was
a breakthrough. Man, in effect, becomes part of the composition.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, we have seen the delirious geometric forms of the
Italian Baroque churches, the darker, brooding Spanish version, and
the more pompous monuments of neoclassicism.</TE>
<TE>   But in modern times the most radical challenge to the conventional
church plan came from the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), whose
reforms were intended to adjust church doctrine to contemporary
reality. Those reforms were interpreted by architects as a move away
from the basic nave and transept pattern toward a more communal
experience, with the congregation wrapped more closely around the
central altar.</TE>
<TE>   The architecture of most modern Catholic cathedrals is an
expression of that ideological shift. In San Francisco, for example,
Pier Luigi Nervi's Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption, completed
in 1970, virtually ignores previous church models. Square in plan,
its massive concrete pillars rise up from the corners to support a
soaring roof. The altar is set along one side of the square, with the
congregation fanning out in front of it. The result is a structure
shaped by Machine Age notions of modernity as much as by any symbols
of Christianity. Its most recognizable icon is its roof, which has
been compared with a bishop's hat.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, however, the most dramatic innovations in
church design were made by architects working for evangelical
ministries, not for the Catholic Church. The most famous of these
were commissioned by Robert Schuller, who began his career preaching
at a drive-in theater in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Schuller asked Modernist Richard Neutra to design a
chapel that would reflect the suburban lifestyle of his flock. The
result was a sleek Modernist chapel with an enormous sliding glass
wall that opened to an outdoor parking lot. Visitors could sit in the
comfort of their parked cars and listen to sermons on outdoor
speakers, then zip away without ever entering the church.</TE>
<TE>   Schuller expanded that vision 20 years later, when he hired Philip
Johnson and John Burgee to design the Crystal Cathedral, an immense,
star-shaped shed of shimmering, reflective glass set in a sea of
parking. The cathedral, which looms over Neutra's chapel, was
designed as much as a backdrop for the evangelist's television
sermons as a house of worship, but its altar, slightly off axis from
the nave, allowed Schuller to preach to those outside through a
90-foot-tall, sliding mechanical door.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels can be read
as an attack on the media-age culture that spawned Schuller's vision.
Towering above the 101 Freeway, which snakes by 35 feet below, the
cathedral's only nod to the car is its faceted, concrete campanile,
which serves as a visual marker to passing commuters. The cathedral's
grand facade looms over the plaza, where the crowds can gather for
outdoor services, much like at St. Peter's. Parking, meanwhile, is
buried underground, below the archdiocese offices that frame the
plaza's eastern edge.</TE>
<TE>   But Moneo's design is more than a conscious return to earlier
precedents. It is an attempt to create a spiritual sanctuary shielded
from the corruption and noise of contemporary culture. In medieval
times, churches flowed with the lifeblood of the city. They were
often chaotic places, their aisles functioning as a refuge for the
destitute.</TE>
<TE>   Moneo's cathedral, though it is in the heart of downtown, is more
cloistered. Its plaza is only accessible through gates along Temple
Street or from the underground parking structure. Inside, the
cathedral has an aura of monastic seclusion.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of isolation is reinforced by the cathedral's layout,
which draws inspiration from classical Modern precedents. A
half-century ago, for example, the great Modernist architect Le
Corbusier conceived his Ronchamp Chapel near Belfort, France, as part
of a drawn-out pilgrimage. The chapel's sculptural form, with its
swooping roof, comes into view as visitors mount the hill, moving
around it toward the entry.</TE>
<TE>   Moneo's design internalizes that diagram. To do so, it turns the
traditional church inside out. Rather than enter from the end of the
nave, visitors arrive at the cathedral's altar end, via the plaza.
From there, a long ambulatory leads past the side chapels to the back
of the church. As one moves along the ambulatory, the walls slightly
converge, and views open up between the chapels into the main worship
space. Only as you reach the end do you turn and see the full scale
of the space, its cavernous form flanked on both sides by enormous
concrete pillars.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to extend the distance between outer and inner worlds.
In effect, Moneo is asking the worshiper to leave the noise of
contemporary culture behind and enter a more peaceful union with God.</TE>
<TE>   But in another sense, that notion of movement through time is
thoroughly modern. If Palladio's visual tricks follow a series of set
points and Le Corbusier's procession is conceived of as part of a
fluid landscape, Moneo's cathedral suggests a precisely framed
narrative journey. The building's asymmetrical forms pull the eye
forward, opening up a sequence of views that are cinematic in nature.</TE>
<TE>   It is in the main sanctuary, finally, that Moneo strives to come
to terms with the cathedral's symbolic meaning. Much as the
Renaissance architect tried to resolve the conflict between the
traditional Latin cross plan and the geometric purity of the circle,
Moneo's design is an effort to reconcile the tension between
traditional forms and the more informal layout of post-Vatican II
cathedrals.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the bulk of the pews are set along the main nave,
facing the altar. More seating flanks the altar on either side, where
the transept would traditionally be located. Using this layout, Moneo
is able to maintain the sense of intimacy prescribed by the Second
Vatican Council while retaining the memory of the Latin cross plan.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Our Lady of the Angels has an aura of formality that St.
Mary's Cathedral, for example, lacks in San Francisco. Unlike Nervi,
Moneo refuses to let go of the thread that binds him to his spiritual
past. His interest lies in the long arc of history, in reconciling
the conflicts that periodically rock the church as it attempts to
adapt to changing realities. It is an evolutionary strategy rather
than a radical surge forward.</TE>
<TE>   It is in that sense that Moneo's cathedral echoes the great works
of earlier church architects. Moneo's design shows no patience for
those who forget the past. Yet it is firmly grounded in the present.
Its ability to transcend those differences is the cathedral's most
remarkable insight.</TE>

<HD>Maybe 'Rising' Refers to Grammy Fever</HD>
<DH>Bruce Springsteen has a lock on album of the year,
observers agree, with Eminem the only serious challenger right now</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The emotions unleashed by the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington last year have launched Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising"
on a direct course to the album of the year Grammy.</LD>
<LD>   So say more than nearly two dozen music professionals informally
surveyed, including Grammy voters and journalists who have spent
years evaluating the habits of the voting membership of the National
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   Can anything even challenge Springsteen's album for the top award?</LD>
<TE>   "At this point, it would almost take a change in the global
political situation or something," says Alan Light, former editor in
chief of Spin and Vibe magazines and author of a recent New Yorker
essay about "The Rising." The album's lyrics are largely concerned
with the feelings of shock, grief and resolve people experienced
following the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   So the Feb. 23 Grammy gala at New York's Madison Square Garden may
have more the look of a coronation than a contest.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine how they'll build drama," says Craig Marks,
editor of Blender magazine. "They'll have to do some salute to
America, which by February may have a different spin. Who knows what
will happen by then? The way drama might happen is if there's
politics playing out on stage. Will Springsteen get up and say
anything [political]? Will there be any George Bush criticism on
stage? Will it be a platform for any political ideas to be
expressed?"</TE>
<TE>   Tom O'Neil, author of "The Grammys: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide
to Music's Highest Honor," sees one legitimate challenger in Eminem's
"The Eminem Show"--although he has no doubt Springsteen will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "Eminem, who was cheated once before, when the leading critics
said he deserved to win, can't be downplayed and dismissed easily
this time," O'Neil says. He's referring to the 2000 edition, when
Steely Dan's "Two Against Nature" defeated the rapper's "The Marshall
Mathers LP" amid much controversy about his perceived homophobia and
misogyny.</TE>
<TE>   Helping give Eminem momentum this round will be his high profile
at last week's MTV Video Music Awards and the November release of his
first major film, "8 Mile," a loosely autobiographical tale directed
by Curtis Hanson ("L.A. Confidential").</TE>
<TE>   But any sense that Eminem's time is overdue is trumped by
Springsteen's having been overlooked for top Grammy honors in the
past. He's been nominated only once for album of the year, with
1984's "Born in the U.S.A." losing to Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow
Down." And against the emotional weight of "The Rising," Eminem seems
a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   The other three album of the year candidates? The consensus of the
experts has singer Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me" (the favorite for
the best new artist Grammy) and pop breakthrough artist Pink's
"Missundaztood" as the best bets.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other possibilities are the Red Hot Chili Peppers' "By
the Way," No Doubt's "Rock Steady," Nelly's "Nellyville," Wilco's
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," Moby's "18," Elvis Costello's "When We Were
Cruel" and Beck's upcoming "Sea Change."</TE>
<TE>   CRAIG DAVID DE-SQUEAKED: English neo-soul star Craig David isn't
going as far as Britney Spears, who recently shed what was left of
her Disney teen image by declaring publicly that she drinks, smokes
and has had sex. But on "Slicker Than Your Average," the title song
to the follow-up of his 2000 debut album "Born to Do It," he
pointedly addresses the U.K. press' persistent focus on the
trouble-free nature of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you're telling me about my imagery/How I'm squeaky clean
whenever I'm on TV," David, 21, sings in the track. "Too much
jealousy in the industry/Why are you watching me when you should just
let me be Craig."</TE>
<TE>   "Craig isn't preaching," says Colin Lester, the singer's manager.
"For me, if you have a mystique, you don't talk about it, and he
doesn't. But there is one issue, and that's 'Slicker,' which is
relevant to what he's experienced in the last three years, really."</TE>
<TE>   Lester says that with this album, due Nov. 19, David wanted to
show growth from the smooth sound of "Born to Do It," which sold more
than 7 million copies worldwide, more than a million of those in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For half of the new album, he worked again with Mark Hill, the
writer-producer who was his collaborator on the debut. One song, "The
Rise and Fall," is a duet with Sting that David wrote using a sample
of the former Police-man's "Shape of My Heart."</TE>
<TE>   For the other half, he turned to the duo of Trevor Henry and
Antony Marsh, two young mixers with little production experience who
had set up shop in an environment as aesthetically far from the pop
elite as he could find in London.</TE>
<TE>   "They were living in the slums of London," Lester says. "Craig
recorded with them in a tenement block that was about to be torn
down. These guys got a grant to do mixes there. The music Craig made
there is back to basics."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Chicago's Aware Records has been the center of
college-town rock for nearly a decade, serving as the launching pad
for Train, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, John Mayer and Five for Fighting.
Rare early recordings and demos from each are among the tracks on
"Aware Greatest Hits," a compilation due from Columbia Records on
Oct. 29. Other selections include a song by singer-songwriter Shannon
Worrell with background vocals by Dave Matthews, "3 A.M." by
Tabitha's Secret (the early version of Matchbox Twenty) and songs by
Verve Pipe, Guster, Vertical Horizon and Better Than Ezra....</TE>
<TE>   The original Blasters will embark on their first full tour in 17
years this fall to support the release of a live album recorded at
their waters-testing reunion shows in the spring. The album, "Trouble
Bound," is due Oct. 15 from High- Tone Records....</TE>
<TE>   Saying she believes an independent label environment better suits
her as a singer-songwriter, Lisa Loeb is moving from Universal's A&amp;M
Records to indie Artemis Records. She's taking eight songs from her
recent album, "Cake and Pie," and adding four new songs for a new
release to be titled "Hello Lisa," featuring new cover art
referencing the Hello Kitty characters. The album is due Oct. 8.</TE>

<LD>   THE NEGRO PROBLEM</LD>
<LD>   "Welcome Black"</LD>
<TE>   Smile Records/</TE>
<TE>   Image Entertainment</TE>
<TE>   TNP leader Stew gets back to the band thing after two acclaimed
solo albums, and the L.A. group reconvenes to effortlessly deliver
the clever wordplay, insistent melodies and oddly authentic emotion
expected of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome Black" (due in stores Tuesday) is delicately honed
baroque pop festooned with horns, piano, finger-snaps and lots of
la-la-la harmonies. It feels more casual and musically streamlined
than 1999's "Joys and Concerns." It's also, ironically, more joyful
and a bit sillier, thanks to such numbers as the unabashed "Bong
Song"; the love letter to Thelonious Monk "In Time All Time"; and the
concert favorite "I'm Sebastian Cabot," about a homeless black man in
downtown L.A. who thinks he's Mr. French's alter ego.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the humor, the airy complexity of such propulsive
calliope music as "Out Now" (written by bassist and co-producer Heidi
Rodewald) remains among the great delights of this band. But don't
let the sonic sunniness fool ya. Sometimes Stew is just candy-coating
his attitude, as with the rollicking "Is This the Single?" (hmmm,
dunno, but it should be), which pokes fun at the record business'
how-can-we-move-the-most-units mentality, in the process reminding us
that pop can indeed be art. The Negro Problem plays the Knitting
Factory Hollywood on Sept. 28.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   EVA CASSIDY</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine"</TE>
<TE>   Blix St.</TE>
<TE>   When Cassidy died of melanoma in 1996, even her most dedicated
fans couldn't have imagined the success that her albums, most of them
released posthumously, would have. "Imagine" entered the U.K. album
chart last week in the No. 1 position, confirming her stature as a
major international artist.</TE>
<TE>   But short of creating a "Simone"-like synthesized audio Cassidy,
only a finite number of recordings exist, and the small Blix St.
label has had to maneuver carefully to assemble material with
sufficient sound quality for commercial release.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine" doesn't quite rise to the level of past Cassidy albums,
in part because of some mediocre material, in part because of the
technical difficulties of placing her voice front and center in live
recordings.</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, Cassidy's singing can do no wrong. Two
tracks-- "Imagine" and "Danny Boy"--are exquisite displays of musical
artistry. Accompanied only by her guitar, she touches the caring
heart of the former, and poignantly restores the too-often-abused
life spirit of the latter. Further illustrating her remarkable
versatility, "You've Changed" reveals how comfortable she was with
jazz, "Fever" reinvents the old Little Willie John soul classic and
Paul Anka's "It Doesn't Matter Any More" has the easygoing
accessibility of a potential country hit.</TE>
<TE>   --Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   SILVIO RODRIGUEZ</TE>
<TE>   "Expedicion"</TE>
<TE>   Fonomusic/Musicrama</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, this Cuban singer-songwriter released "Triptico," a
largely orchestral collection of three albums celebrating the 25th
anniversary of the Cuban revolution. No matter what your political
convictions were, it was difficult not to be moved by the
troubadour's vision and his knack for merging anthem-like melodies
with evocative lyrics. To this day, "Triptico" stands as one of Latin
music's most poetic achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's latest is a return to that sweeping compositional
canvas. After releasing five acoustic albums in the span of a decade,
the singer begins a new chapter, tackling orchestral arrangements
that at times sound vague and melodramatic, but overall add a welcome
patina of dreamy romanticism to songs about Elian Gonzalez, the war
in Yugoslavia and Rodriguez's impoverished hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Like Ruben Blades, Juan Luis Guerra and Pablo Milanes, Rodriguez
transforms the essence of the Latin American experience into popular
music that's both catchy and erudite, fun and transcendental. His
'60s days as a visionary troubadour may be over, but like Bob Dylan
and Bruce Springsteen in the U.S., he continues to surprise with his
unique point of view and the passion of his voice.</TE>
<TE>   --Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** Supreme Beings of Leisure, "Divine Operating System," Palm
Pictures. The second album from L.A.'s Supreme Beings of Leisure (in
stores Tuesday) introduces the streamlined version of the group. Down
from a trio to the duo of soulful singer Geri Soriano-Lightwood and
instrumentalist Ramin Sukarai, SBL shows off its new MO with the
disco-flavored "Give Up" and the '60s lounge of "Catch Me." Slicker
and more stylish, SBL version 2.0 has created a record that is
unabashedly groovy if ultimately insubstantial.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *** Berlin, "Voyeur," iMUSIC. Pulsing electronica. Muscular
guitar. Dark sexuality. Wistful romanticism. The new collection from
the hit '80s act (due Tuesday) could almost, kinda, be a Garbage
album. Sonically modern and mostly fun, it updates the propulsive
sensuality of such smashes as "The Metro," giving punk-dance siren
Terri Nunn a Madonna-esque vocal sheen (except she way outsings the
Material Girl). If the torchy "To a King" sounds overwrought, the
confectionary "Shiny," the embrace-the-now ballad "The World Is
Waiting" and the edgy rape fantasy "Stranger on the Bus" make for
mature pop that's never, ever stuffy. Berlin plays Sept. 14 at the
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   ** 30 Seconds to Mars, "30 Seconds to Mars," Immortal/Virgin. Just
because Jared Leto is a movie-star hunk doesn't mean he can't moan
mantras of low self-esteem like Staind sad-sack Aaron Lewis. But if
he's actually experienced such despair, it's hard to tell from the
vague, trite lyrics of his L.A. band's debut (the universe is big and
lonely, you know). Producer Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd's "The Wall") gives
the music the appropriate polished-sludge sound, but it's all product
and little personality.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Robin Holcomb, "The Big Time," Nonesuch. Backwoods
spookiness and big-city sophistication find some remarkable common
ground in Seattle-based Holcomb's first song album in 10 years. Her
obsession-shadowed narratives as well as her knowing delivery fall
somewhere between Kate and Anna McGarrigle (who make guest
appearances) and Tori Amos, with subtly stunning backing from such
jazz-rooted boundary-breakers as Wayne Horvitz (her producer and
husband) and guitarist Bill Frisell.</TE>

<LD>   "Largo"</LD>
<TE>   Warner Bros. Records</TE>
<TE>   Young jazz musicians increasingly have been trying to tap into the
sounds of today's pop and avant-garde music, but few have done so as
eloquently as pianist Mehldau on this stunning, genre-defying disc.
At first glance, the prospect of a pianist such as Mehldau drawing on
dance backbeats, cutting-edge electronics and novel sonic effects
might seem like a gimmick. But Mehldau's meticulously conceived
arrangements for acoustic and synthesized instruments prove
revelatory, the pianist weaving his own carefully wrought melodic
lines into brashly innovative, unexpected ensemble sounds. The
grinding beat that drives "Dusty McNugget," for instance, might seem
to be the antithesis of bona fide jazz rhythm. Yet Mehldau finesses
drummer Matt Chamberlain's hard dance beats with extraordinarily
sleek, delicately swinging piano lines, then interrupts the
proceedings with unabashedly classical writing for a small horn
section. The oscillating, head-tripping electronics of "Dropjes," the
distorted-piano effects of "Sabbath," the blips and bleeps of "Free
Willy," and the Samuel Barber-like chamber-music setting of "When It
Rains" distinguish this as one of the most daring new recordings of
the year, and one of the most successful.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET</TE>
<TE>   "Footsteps of Our Fathers"</TE>
<TE>   Marsalis Music</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy Award-winning saxophonist and former leader of Jay
Leno's "Tonight Show" band made news earlier this year when he
announced that he was forming his own record label. If this, the
imprint's first release, is indicative of the recordings to come,
there's cause to celebrate, for this CD embodies precisely the
commitment to art over commerce that Marsalis said his label would
represent. Moreover, it stands as a significant achievement for
Marsalis, who intelligently reinterprets two landmark jazz works,
Sonny Rollins' "The Freedom Suite" and John Coltrane's "A Love
Supreme." Marsalis is not simply retracing the steps of two
acknowledged masterpieces. On the contrary, he offers a decidedly
fresh perspective on these milestones, attaining profound balladry in
certain passages of "Freedom," and ferocious energy and a searing
intensity in the climactic sections of "Supreme." Like many carefully
conceived recordings, this one takes time to gather momentum, but
when it does, there's no denying its emotional force.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   VON FREEMAN</TE>
<TE>   "The Improviser"</TE>
<TE>   Premonition Records</TE>
<TE>   Although he has been a mentor to several generations of American
jazz musicians, the mighty Chicago tenor saxophonist has been
tragically under-recorded. Yet as he approaches his 80th birthday,
Freeman--whom everyone in jazz simply calls "Vonski"--has enjoyed
belated recognition, which is sure to deepen with the release of this
beautifully recorded, shrewdly conceived CD. Because so few Freeman
discs are available, the producers of the "The Improviser" wisely
opted to record Freeman in several musical settings. Thus, "If I
Should Lose You" documents his romantic, 1930s-era solo playing;
"What Is This Thing Called Love?" shows his state-of-the-art bebop
style as he leads a quartet; and Duke Ellington's "I Like the
Sunrise" casts Freeman in a haunting duet with noted young pianist
Jason Moran. The unorthodox phrases and squealing bent pitches that
Freeman produces alongside Moran attest to the saxophonist's
still-adventurous spirit, and to the allure he holds for a new
generation of jazz talent.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ROB MAZUREK</TE>
<TE>   "Silver Spines"</TE>
<TE>   Delmark Records</TE>
<TE>   During the past few years, cornetist Mazurek has earned a place at
the forefront of jazz experimentation, his latest release again
taking him into strange, uncharted terrain. Granted, the chiming
tubular bells, rumbling Moog synthesizers, random "found sounds" and
freewheeling cornet solos will strike some listeners as wholly
unrelated to the vocabulary of jazz. Anyone who wants to learn where
one of the more radical free-thinkers of 21st century jazz sees the
future heading, "Silver Spines" offers an uninhibited crash course.</TE>

<DH>Trying to expand, a group dedicated to putting on plays by
local writers runs into a roadblock</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles playwrights often feel overshadowed by the movie and TV
industries. They even feel neglected by many L.A. theater producers.</LD>
<LD>   Enter Jon Lawrence Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   For a decade, Rivera's Playwrights' Arena has developed and
produced nothing but new plays by Los Angeles County writers--29 such
shows by 17 writers or writing teams.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera, the artistic director, is adamant that the writers of
Playwrights' Arena shows must have a permanent residence in Los
Angeles County--Orange County won't qualify. And the plays must be at
least West Coast premieres, if not world premieres.</TE>
<TE>   These haven't been big productions. The company spent its
formative years in a 35-seat venue. Last year, Playwrights' Arena
launched a five-year plan to expand its productions at Los Angeles
Theatre Center's Theatre 2. But now, in its second year, the plan is
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The company's current production, "Failure of Nerve," was to use
150 seats and a wage-paying Actors' Equity contract--instead of
Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan, which the company normally uses and
under which the actors receive only token fees. But an Equity
committee decided that Playwrights' Arena wasn't financially ready.
The show reverted to the 99-seat plan. Now the future of the
company's Los Angeles Theatre Center residency, which hinged on its
five-year plan, is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Rivera acknowledged, his company's mission "feels
suicidal.... There are moments when I say, 'What am I doing? I should
just do plays by Wilder, Williams and Chekhov.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is an unlikely candidate to be a champion of local
playwrights. He was not raised in L.A. or even in the United States,
and he is not a playwright.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in 1960 in Manila. His father, Jose Lorenzo Rivera,
edited Pace, a newsmagazine that displeased the Marcos government.
With several members of the magazine's staff detained by the Marcos
regime, the older Rivera left the Philippines in 1972 and settled in
Sydney, Australia. His wife and three children joined him in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   In Australia, Rivera watched his journalist father--now known as
Larry Rivera--blossoming into a playwright and stage director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear where I got this passion," he recalled. "When my
father and I get together, we talk about plays in detail."</TE>
<TE>   After high school graduation in 1978, Rivera began studying at
Sydney's Ensemble Studio Theatre. In 1979, he was cast in his
first--and only--play as an actor, a revival of the dramatization of
W. Somerset Maugham's "Rain," in which he played "one of the natives
who walks around Bora Bora." But he left before the run ended,
because long-sought legal permission for his family to enter the
United States had finally come through. With his mother and siblings,
Rivera moved in with his mother's sister in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   With his marriage on shaky ground, Larry Rivera didn't follow. Jon
Rivera didn't see or speak with his father again until 1992, when
Larry Rivera was finally reunited with his family at the American
wedding of his only daughter, Jon's sister.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, father and son have been on good terms. Larry Rivera
even maintains the Playwrights' Arena Web site from Australia.</TE>
<TE>   When Jon arrived in America, he worked as a clerk in a law office.
In 1981, however, he returned to performing. He raised the $4,800
that was required to tour with Up With People, the musical revue
company. From the summer of 1981 until the summer of 1982, he
performed in 20 cities in 14 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his return, Rivera noticed that a small theater, the Cast,
was about a block from where he lived in Hollywood. He was entranced
by a Cast production of the Studs Terkel musical "Working." He
couldn't afford to pay to see it again. So he simply listened to
it--about 30 times--from the sidewalk outside.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he had enrolled at Los Angeles City College, taking film and
theater. He and three fellow students rented one of the small spaces
at what is now called the Complex, in Hollywood, and revived two
one-acts, with Rivera directing "Birdbath." Friends began asking him
to produce or direct similar shows. He complied, but he also began
looking for new plays.</TE>
<TE>   He found one by another former LACC theater student, Justin
Tanner. Rivera saw an early Tanner play at the college and
co-produced "Changing Channels" at a small theater in Hollywood. It
was the production that introduced Tanner to the people who ran the
Cast Theatre, where Tanner would later become L.A.'s best-known
home-grown playwright of the '90s. Tanner now credits Rivera with
generally "being on the front lines of L.A. theater."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera staged the U.S. premiere of a British play, "Lunch
Girls/City Gents" at Los Angeles Theatre Center. The playwright, Ron
Hart, remained in London. "From that experience," Rivera said, "I
realized that it was hard to communicate long-distance. If I wanted a
true collaboration, the playwright had better be here." He decided to
concentrate on L.A. playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Rivera and actor Steve Tyler started Playwrights' Arena
to produce "Carla," by Leonard Post. That year's riots struck about
two weeks after the show opened in Hollywood. Rivera recalls a
sidewalk conversation in which he and Tyler decided to devote their
company to new plays by L.A. writers. After the riots, he said, it
was obvious that "people had no place to put their energies. I knew I
could promote local playwrights, who had been complaining that no one
produced them unless they've been successful somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera and Tyler turned the 35-seat Carpet Company stage on Pico
Boulevard into the group's home. But two years later, managing
director Tyler left. The two had disagreements over fund-raising, and
Tyler recalls that he favored somewhat more commercial fare than did
Rivera, whose "idea of theater was a little darker and more
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a struggle," Rivera said. "Nobody knew us, nobody cared."
A 1996 production, "Black Dawn," at the mid-size Ivar Theatre lost
money. But a co-producer absorbed the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1999, Luis Alfaro's "Straight as a Line" was enough of
a hit that it moved to a 99-seat venue after its first run.</TE>
<TE>   But the following year, the group lost its Pico home when the rent
doubled. Forced to use other spaces, the company found a good deal at
Los Angeles Theatre Center.</TE>
<TE>   Even though LATC Theatre 2 has 297 seats, Equity tentatively
agreed to allow Playwrights' Arena to use only 99, along with the
99-Seat Plan. But the company would have to show that it could
eventually move up to an Equity contract and use the full capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Alfaro's "Bitter Homes and Gardens" launched the residency last
year on a high note, although the play never sold out. But the other
two shows in Rivera's announced season never happened; key personnel
had conflicts. Two other shows, a reprise of the earlier musical
"Moscow" and "Beachwood Drive," were drafted to fill out the
subscription season.</TE>
<TE>   This year, two more shows failed to sell out at 99 seats. Noting
this and the general state of Playwrights' Arena's finances, an
Equity committee balked at approving a contract for "Failure of
Nerve." "The committee wasn't interested in seeing him put himself
out of business," said Equity's Timothy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem isn't fund-raising. Of the company's $135,000
budget this year, about $75,000 was donated, Rivera said.</TE>
<TE>   The greater challenge is to overcome the marketing hurdles
inherent in doing only new plays. Subscribers hesitate to commit
their cash upfront to a season of unknown plays; the subscription
list numbers a mere 56. "The key is to get better-known writers,"
Rivera said. One board member pointed out that Neil Simon is an L.A.
playwright. "Yes, but he's not giving us his next new play," Rivera
replied.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera doesn't feel bitter about Equity's decision. If the company
is forced out of the LATC venue, it will try to find a 99-seat space
as its new home.</TE>
<TE>   Although his mission may appear untenable, Rivera's fans are
loyal. Alfaro, for one, said of Rivera's direction of his plays: "I
had never seen a director be as gentle and firm in walking the actor
through the beats of these emotional breakdowns.... He is interested
in how real emotion can overpower and strengthen the language of a
play. It's brave and scary."</TE>
<TE>   Active in Theatre LA, Rivera last fall directed the organization's
Ovation Awards ceremony at the new Kodak Theatre. It was plagued by a
range of ticketing and technical snafus, and a widely mocked
choreographic style--although Rivera was hardly the only person to
take the rap.</TE>
<TE>   But Rivera also works in other, less visible ways for the larger
L.A. theater community, Alfaro said: "Every year Jon hosts a free
actors' Thanksgiving dinner, followed by a Christmas tea. He really
believes that the only way to make great art is to be surrounded by
great artists. He goes way beyond the call of an artistic director to
create community in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera said he must collaborate with others. He once spent a
solitary three hours trying to write a play, "but I was so critical.
And I have no self-discipline. I love producing and directing because
I don't have to work by myself."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his devotion to L.A., Playwrights' Arena has ventured
overseas, taking "Moscow" to two Edinburgh Fringe Festivals. This
fall, Rivera will take his company's production of "Beachwood Drive"
to a festival in Lublin, Poland, followed by a production of "Moscow"
at a festival in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Rivera can extend his sense of community and
collaboration to a larger Los Angeles audience is very much an open
question.</TE>

<DH>Gajin Fujita's graffiti-influenced, culturally erotic
painting reflects his upbringing as a Japanese American artist in
Boyle Heights</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gajin Fujita could be a cheery advertisement planted by the city's
boosters. A Japanese American painter influenced by Latino graffiti,
informed by gangland aesthetics but with the violence removed, he
mixes high culture and low, East and West, past and present. If he
were a musician, he'd be signed to David Byrne's genre-bending Luaka
Bop label.</LD>
<LD>   Fujita has earned his eclecticism honestly; he's got too much soul
to be called an arid postmodernist. He grew up in Boyle Heights, an
East L.A. neighborhood known for Los Lobos, mariachi bands and florid
murals. His late Japanese-born father made his living as an abstract
landscape painter, and his mother restores Japanese antiques. The
style of his work grew from the elements of his environment; in the
last few years he's learned the knack of combining them, with
traditional Japanese imagery and erotica, into a striking whole.</LD>
<LD>   Some of Fujita's influences, in fact, were passed down quite
literally. "These are better than Playboy," he says, eyes wide,
pulling down a dog-eared art book his father left him. The tome,
compiled from a Scandinavian erotic art show from 1968, shows men and
women from around the world, coupling in every possible
combination--a multicultural version of the Kama Sutra.</LD>
<TE>   The artist never imagined the past as a musty place. "I've always
thought that there were a great deal of sexual acts and deviances
played out through history," says Fujita, his mom dusting her home,
which doubles as his studio, around him. "And they probably were a
bit more crazy, to my mind--inventing new moves and whatnot."</TE>
<TE>   All these influences--and a turn with Las Vegas art guru Dave
Hickey--have led Fujita to create the pieces that go up at his first
major U.S. solo show,  at L.A. Louver gallery on Sept. 12. Their most
immediately striking quality is the almost reverent mix of Japanese
woodblock art of the feudal Edo period (1603-1867) with urban
reality. "I kind of look at myself as a hip-hopper, the way a DJ
would sample all sorts of great music from the past--sounds and
beats," he says. "I'm just doing it with visuals here."</TE>
<TE>   The horizontal pieces, with their fervently crafted, densely
decorated surfaces, range from 20 inches across to almost wall-sized.
One painting--"Gold State Warriors," a 12-paneled canvas based on
traditional Japanese screens--shows samurai drawing swords against a
gold leaf background covered in dense graffiti: It's as if the
characters in a Kurosawa film found themselves lost in a bad part of
town.</TE>
<TE>   In another, appropriately titled "Libido," a nobleman and a geisha
make love alongside a bowing Virgin Mary of the sort that decorates
the taquerias and corner bars of Fujita's neighborhood. The piece is
full of visual puns (most of which cannot be described here).</TE>
<TE>   Instead of trying to integrate the two worlds of his pieces--the
feudal with the urban--the artist leaves the incongruities unremarked
upon.</TE>
<TE>   Whether painting a dragon, the stylized letters that spell out his
titles or background patterns inspired by Japanese textiles, Fujita
never gives the sense that he's slumming. His detractors, in fact,
find his work lacking in the spontaneity of real graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita's a humble, polite guy in a ponytail and a goatee who's
always talking about how lucky, how grateful he is. The farthest west
he typically goes is the Echo Park apartment he shares with Berkeley
native Lisa Ishikawa, whom he married this spring. His painting
leaves him little time to travel, play basketball or surf.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita's enthusiasm and constant gratitude make him seem younger
than his 30 years; his manner is almost innocent. But he's no mama's
boy. He's ripping through the streets now, behind the wheel of his
little Toyota, passing murals and tags on bodegas and pet stores, in
awe of the iconography and the low riders that pass him on Cesar
Chavez Avenue. It wasn't long ago that he was painting bridges and
freeway walls instead of hunching over a canvas. "The crew that I
belong to," he says proudly, as if listing an academic degree, "is
K2S. 'Kill to Succeed.' " His eyes are on the traffic in front of
him.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita's parents came to the States from Tokyo--looking for a more
liberal setting and a richer market for painting--only a few years
before he was born, and Fujita grew up in what he calls a traditional
Japanese home. His mother made him and his two younger brothers keep
diaries and paint still lifes from the fruits and vegetables she
brought in from the backyard garden. "And that really kept us in
tune, really kept us focused," he says. Knowing the financial
struggles all too well, his artist father, who died in 1996, hoped
his son would become something more practical than a painter. ("He'd
probably be rolling over in his grave," Fujita says with a laugh,
about his own career.)</TE>
<TE>   Fujita's first exposure to graffiti came early; he had only to
look out the window or step outside to see the marks on bridges, his
garage and even the walls of his house. By elementary school, he was
meeting gang kids and talking to them about tagging and territory. "I
don't know if any fear was instilled in me, because I never tried to
do any wrong to these people," he says. "I admired their
mark-making." When he talks about these years--tagging bridges from
skateboards, running laps in neighborhood cemeteries for exercise--he
sounds almost wistful.</TE>
<TE>   One of Fujita's most important early discoveries came by chance.
While he'd been aware of the tags around him, it was later, while
traveling from East L.A. to Fairfax High School, a visual arts
magnet, that he learned the form's true beauty. "It wasn't just gang
writing," recalls Fujita. "It was more stylized and taken from the
New York subway art culture." The thing that struck him the most were
placas, letter designs, used to claim turf, which can take up the
entire side of a building.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to traffic and the frequent stops of the MTA bus he rode
every day, Fujita had two hours in the morning and another two in the
afternoon to get to know the urban landscape. "Buses are just the
worst, but that was the roots, the beginning, of my graffiti," he
says. He also discovered that the kids making the placas were on the
bus too. The long ride allowed him to learn the finer points of
tagging and the more sophisticated and colorful "bombing": He met
crews with names like Hollywood agencies: WCA (rich Westsiders who
call themselves West Coast Artists), and KSN (Hollywood's Kings Stop
at Nothing), KGB (Kids Gone Bad, Hollywood and midtown).</TE>
<TE>   But for all the strata represented, the scene Fujita saw was not
racially segregated. "It was truly about the art," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax High was fragmented into the usual teenage cliques and
social layers, with jocks on one side, beautiful people on another,
artsy types on another. "As soon as we got to school," Fujita says,
"the experience would kind of end."</TE>
<TE>   During this period, other kids from the neighborhood fell into
drugs and violence, and some of his friends from K2S were killed as
teenagers, stabbed or shot. Gajin dodged the violence, heading to
college to study art. He credits his parents with keeping him "from
falling into these trap doors."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Grieger, a professor who later became the artist's
unofficial advisor, remembers Fujita's 1993 arrival at Otis College
of Art and Design. "He was a rough-edged urban kid when he first came
to the school," Grieger says. "A funny, streetwise young guy. The
rough edges were hiding a real sweet person."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Fujita had an unusual, almost obsessive
attention to detail. "His face was always in his paintings," recalls
Grieger, who figures the attentiveness came from the artist's
parents. "He was looking at the details of the pigment, at the way
the surfaces were building up, the way the paint was drying. It tells
a teacher: There's a real painter."</TE>
<TE>   Otis offered some good teaching and time to concentrate on
artwork. Still, Fujita recalls Otis mostly as a "teeth-pulling
experience." He spent more time than he liked theorizing about art
instead of sharpening his ability to produce it. He compares the
process of painting with surfing or skateboarding. "It's like a
sport--you're not really gonna get it unless you experience it
hands-on," he says. "In order to make it, you've got to get your
hands and feet dirty; you can't just talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   It was later, as a graduate student at the University of Nevada
Las Vegas, that Fujita learned to love art history--especially the
Renaissance, which he calls a "transgressive period" starring
"Caravaggio, the evil genius" and "Raphael, this little punk kid in
Florence, who was bringing about new styles."</TE>
<TE>   What he most admires about the Renaissance artists, Fujita says,
is their discipline and work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   By graduate school, Fujita was selling and exhibiting work as
rapidly as possible. A classmate helped him land a New York gallery,
Kravets/Wehby in Manhattan's Chelsea district, when he was only 28;
he sold nearly two dozen paintings. At about the time he graduated
with a master's in fine art in 2000, a series of well-reviewed
appearances in small group shows, from Austin, Texas, to Bologna,
Italy, helped spread his reputation, culminating in "Rogue Wave:
Eleven Artists from L.A.," held at L.A. Louver in the summer of 2001.
The gallery--associated with California icons  such as the late
minimalist John McCracken, installation artist Ed Kienholz and
painter David Hockney--signed him late last year, bringing him some
financial security and giving him an important stamp of approval. "It
allowed me to survive on what I liked to do."</TE>
<TE>   Fujita's breakout as an artist has a lot to do with an eccentric
mentor, art critic Dave Hickey, author of "Air Guitar: Essays on Art
and Democracy" and a writer whose style is equal parts Jack Kerouac,
rock scribe Greil Marcus and Wild West braggadocio. His
ideas--especially his emphasis on Beauty and his call for a raw
Americanism--have made him an underground hero and a force in the art
world. For a decade, he has taught at UNLV, where Fujita became one
of his graduate students. Last year, Hickey chose him as the youngest
artist in the Santa Fe Biennial, a show he curated that many critics
considered among 2001's most important.</TE>
<TE>   "I was calculatingly choosing impure styles," Hickey says. "And
Gajin has a kind of classic impure style. Hispano-Nipponese--it's a
little weird." He laughs. "But it's in the deepest tradition of
Western art," at least since Renaissance Italy. "You wouldn't have
Degas without Japanese prints."</TE>
<TE>   Hickey asked Fujita to design a graffiti-style logo to wrap around
the former beer warehouse that housed the biennial, as a way of
cutting against the show's "elitist" title: "Beau Monde: Toward a
Redeemed Cosmopolitanism."</TE>
<TE>   Says Hickey: "Art practice at the moment is an extremely
upper-middle-class endeavor, full of mildness and diffidence. But
Gajin's got a little street in him. He's willing to put it out there
and compete. His work doesn't ask to be forgiven or understood."
Fujita's work, he says, is about props: "It's about respect, about
commanding and demanding. It's a lot more confrontational" than art
from the liberal-academic mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Fujita's paintings borrow mythic and historic
figures--dragons, a scowling demon, a phoenix--from Japanese prints.
Graphic, sexualized figures from the same source fill about half of
his pieces. He's hardly the only fine artist using the erotic: A
recent essay in the Times of London argued that sexual imagery is
running rampant in high art, in the same way it's conquered
advertising and escorted porn toward the mainstream. "In the
Seventies and Eighties, however, art that had sex as its theme had a
slightly prudish undertow," wrote Sebastian Snee. "It came loaded
with implied critiques, some from a feminist perspective, others from
a gay or class perspective or from various other kinds of
disapproving, sex-is-the-seat-of-all-power mentality."</TE>
<TE>   But with recent artists--Snee named photographers Nobuyoshi Araki,
Richard Kern and shooter David LaChapelle--there's no distance from
the sex. "The new kind of sex-focused art is neither critical nor
ironic about the implications of our sex-saturated society. It is
happy just to give it to us."</TE>
<TE>   Fujita doesn't sweat over the sexuality in his work. He talks
about how he wants to "violate people's expectations," but the
critique ends there. In Las Vegas, he says, he was surrounded by so
much naked flesh, on billboards and elsewhere, that it was hard to
avoid bringing it into his art. (When asked to describe the city, he
cites "so many distractions--there were women, there was money--a
hard place to live without any loot.") He uses erotic imagery, he
says, to provoke excitement. "Figures have always been a leading icon
to us humans. And when you do nudes and people doing it, it's like,
whoa!"</TE>
<TE>   Hickey contends that despite the culture's saturation with sexual
imagery, Fujita's work stands out. "It's a way of tapping a deep
cultural resource--the deep tradition of Japanese art," he says. "I
know almost no [other] high-style eroticism. There's not much
genuinely sexy art out there."</TE>
<TE>   You might assume that every emerging artist with a Japanese name,
especially those who use groovy contemporary references, is a member
of the Superflat gang--the young, trendy Tokyo artists collected in a
Museum of Contemporary Art show of 2001. Fujita finds these
paintings, with their flat surfaces and reliance on crisp,
machine-made processes, mostly just hip graphic design. One of his
peers in Santa Fe was Superflat artist Takashi Murakami, a painter
and sculptor. Fujita praises the artist's skill with his usual
discretion, then adds: "His work is definitely of a time, a time
that's taken place already. I'd like to keep working where I can
outlast time, which is hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what makes art last for the ages, he doesn't hesitate. "I
think it's the human touch. The turnoff for me for Murakami's work is
that some of it is prefabricated."</TE>
<TE>   In one way, Fujita concedes, he's deeply conventional: "I like to
rely on my own techniques and skills, with my own hands. That's why I
like looking at the masters of ancient times--it was all their hands,
or their direction if they used assistants." His goals for his work
are simple. "I just want for my finished product to be the most
pristine, evoking the most beauty, of all the works out there."</TE>
<TE>   For all his perfectionism, Fujita is not far from the street: He
still gets a charge out of spotting a patch of wet cement, where he
learned at an early age that he could make a truly permanent mark.</TE>
<TE>   The wild contrasts in his work seem to reflect his temperament:
When asked about his solo show, he turns into Miss America accepting
a bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, gosh! I think it means a lot," he says, nearly blushing. "Not
just for myself, but I think, in perspective, for the graffiti world
of L.A., California, the West Coast. And I'd like to think that I'm
breaking ground, and pioneering something, and giving an ultimatum,
another segue, or a path for other graffiti artists to pursue fine
arts."</TE>

<DH>The mighty 'Spider-Man' and the plucky 'Greek Wedding' have
one thing in common: emotional connections. Hollywood, take note.</DH>

<LD>The Labor Day weekend traditionally marks the end of the summer, the
time when America returns to school and young people, in theory at
least, turn their attention to lessons that need to be learned.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood, however, does things slightly differently. Its Labor
Day focus is also on things to be learned, but they are the lessons
of the summer past, not the fall and winter to come.</LD>
<LD>   For the hot-weather months are traditionally the studios' biggest
season, the source of a sizable chunk of theatrical revenue. And like
former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, forever asking passersby, "How'm
I doin'?," Hollywood is always looking to see how it did, to see what
it can take away from the summer just ended and apply to figuring out
what audiences will pay money to see in the future.</LD>
<TE>   In terms of summer 2002, the two films that Hollywood most wants
to learn from seem initially to be at the opposite ends of the
spectrum. There's the mighty "Spider-Man," which cost the earth and
earned it back, and the plucky "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," a mouse
that roared despite its modest $5-million budget. But on a deeper
level, it can be argued that both films are actually teaching the
same lesson, a lesson of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   With its record-setting $120-million opening weekend and a
domestic take that's currently more than $400 million, "Spider-Man"
set off shock waves throughout Hollywood. "Before 'Spider-Man,' we'd
never had a $100-million weekend for a movie," Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, the box office tracking firm, told
the Hollywood Reporter. "That was considered the Holy Grail of the
box office, and now it's happened."</TE>
<TE>   It's not difficult to imagine the envy that seeped into meetings
at competing studios the Monday that figure became official. "Where's
our 'Spider-Man?' " aggrieved big shots no doubt demanded of harried
underlings. Paradoxically, it's quite possible that the search for
the next big thing is looking for love in all the wrong places,
taking the wrong lesson from those eye-popping opening days.</TE>
<TE>   If there has been a misunderstanding, it's quite understandable,
because "Spider-Man" looks at first blush like the latest example of
the changed nature of the movie business, Hollywood's enslavement to
the core teenage and early-20s demographic that controls a sizable
share of what the studios produce.</TE>
<TE>   For, unlike their fussy parents, these young viewers are ready and
willing to go to the movies, and they have the money to make it
happen. According to a study by Teenage Research Unlimited reported
in Publishers Weekly, last year "American teens spent close to $172
billion, or $104 per teen per week--and that's not counting the other
spending that is influenced by teens."</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that studios rush to cater to this affluent
market, making movies with teenage protagonists, moving heaven and
earth to find kid-friendly comic book properties that have yet to be
optioned and hoping to strike the kind of gold that "Batman," "Men in
Black" and now "Spider-Man" have struck? Is it really a surprise that
one studio head told a prominent director, "We're no longer making
movies for an audience that has to be dynamited out of their houses"?</TE>
<TE>   Yet, given how much money "Spider-Man" made in so short a time, it
is likely that this film reached further than the movies' youthful
core constituency, actually getting to some of that
needs-to-be-dynamited demographic. For "Spider-Man" turned out to be
that rare comic-book movie that worked a bit on an emotional level,
and that could well have made all the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The word in Hollywood was that Sam Raimi got the "Spider-Man"
assignment by being the only director to talk to Sony executives not
about all the special effects he could muster, but about the
emotional quotient of a boy named Peter Parker discovering he had
super powers. A concern that paid off for him and for us.</TE>
<TE>   When you talk to viewers who enjoyed "Spider-Man," no one mentions
the tedious villain that Willem Dafoe had the misfortune to play, or
the way the film all but grinds to a halt in its pro forma second
half. What audiences remember, a key to what drew them to the film in
such large numbers, is an unlooked-for emotional quotient that, while
not exactly in the "Secrets &amp; Lies" category, was still higher than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   This comes out first in the sections where a shaky Parker learns
through amusing trial and error how to master his wall-climbing,
web-slinging powers. These kinds of identifiable, human moments are
easy to empathize with but increasingly difficult to find in today's
super-extravaganzas.</TE>
<TE>   Better still is the palpable connection stars Tobey Maguire and
Kirsten Dunst make on screen. Their upside-down kiss in the rain has
an almost tangible passion to it, a sense of life that, if hardly
real, is once again closer than we usually get in this day and age.</TE>
<TE>   This is where "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" comes in. Positioned on
an ever-growing number of screens (1,329 at latest count) and
climbing ever higher on the box office chart (only "Signs," "XXX" and
"Spy Kids 2" finished ahead of it last week), this little film will
likely hit an undreamed-of $70-million gross by Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, this independent film with no stars and a
negligible advertising budget has taken the need-to-be-dynamited
classes by storm. A random sampling of moviegoers nationwide revealed
that this was the movie on everyone's mind. Someone even reported
that a five-screen art house in Rochester, N.Y., saved itself from
extinction by playing the film on all five screens.</TE>
<TE>   The remarkable thing about "My Big Fat Greek Wedding's" success is
that, by most standards, it is not a very good film. An undemanding,
middle-of-the-road fairy tale about a feisty Greek woman who marries
outside her wacky sitcom culture, it has little to recommend it from
any filmmaking standpoint.</TE>
<TE>   But what "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" has in great abundance is the
same thing that differentiates "Spider-Man" from films like "XXX" and
"Goldmember": a warmth, a belief in emotion, a connection, albeit
artificial, with the stuff of life. That makes this film stand out
from its bland, cookie-cutter rivals the way Tula the Greek heroine
stands out from the look-alike WASPs of her future husband's regular
dating pool.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is certainly gratifying to see moviegoers voting for
emotion in such huge numbers, there is finally something dispiriting
about this as well. For the huge success of both films inevitably
points up how starved today's audiences are for anything that has
true emotional content. There is such a desperate need for that kind
of connection that people ignore flaws, put up with contrivances,
embrace half-loaves as if they were beautiful and whole. If films
like these ever actually delivered on all they promise, who knows how
successful they might be?</TE>

<LD>If the decibel levels and vocabulary unleashed by some high school
sports coaches were transferred to the rest of the high school world,
marching bands would be scattering, debate teams would be disbanding
and lawsuits from angry parents would be flying.</LD>
<LD>   So thanks are due to the Capistrano Unified School District for
being host to etiquette classes for high school coaches, too many of
whom have earned a reputation for turning scholastic sports into a
field of screams.</LD>
<LD>   The "Pursuing Victory With Honor" class would seem outlandish if
we weren't talking about sports. It has a simple concept: Why do
parents and high school administrators tolerate boorish behavior from
coaches that would never be accepted from a teacher standing in an
English class or a biology lab? Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis is
credited with elevating the "just win, baby" philosophy to an art
form. But high school coaches who follow in Davis' footsteps are
building the foundation for a destructive winning-is-everything
mind-set.</LD>
<TE>   Capistrano has offered the program to coaches, both local and not,
seven times since December. The three days of classes are taught by
sports psychologists, athletic trainers and teachers. Aside from
civility, The curriculum covers nutrition and basic coaching
strategies. Many high school coaches are part-timers who coach
volleyball, swimming, basketball or other sports because they love
the game.</TE>
<TE>   When the hours of watching game film, drafting strategy and
monitoring athletes are tallied, it's clear that they're not in it
for the money. But coaches also serve as classroom teachers who are
there to teach, not bully.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects coaches to attach a "please" and "thank you" to
every barked command to hit the blocking sled or "drop and gimme 40."
But ugly incidents, including abusive language by coaches,
trash-talking by athletes and pushy behavior among parents, are
sparking interest statewide among principals and athletic directors
who recognize that this is high school, not boot camp.</TE>
<TE>   The classes are wrapped in an attractive ribbon--coaches can use
the course to meet continuing education requirements. Even so, some
coaches and schools are balking. School districts and athletic
leagues should pick up the ball and demand that coaches attend the
class before picking up a whistle.</TE>

<LD>We've been meaning to comment for several weeks now--or was it just
one?--on the controversy over whether herbal and other supplements do
good things like improve human memory. Over the centuries,
health-seeking humans have self-prescribed a lot of pills, elixirs,
potions, powders, creams and downright foul-smelling, evil-tasting
stuff. But everybody still died anyway. So earnest American Medical
Assn. researchers took a chill pill and decided to do one of those
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials
on ginkgo supplements. They got 230 folks over 60 to remember to down
40 milligrams of ginkgo or a placebo three times per day. They took
tests before and after and were interviewed both times too.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of Americans consume such daily supplements. We've always
been an up-and-at-'em, take-charge society that likes new things--new
worlds, new lands, new spouses, new bodies, hopefully without new
wrinkles. One new study suggests that rubbing caffeine on exposed
areas prevents skin cancer, a new reason to spill coffee.</LD>
<TE>   Every year, Americans rub oceans of stuff all over their bodies
and swallow tons of supplements because we want less fat, more
muscle, less hair, less hair loss, more color, less curls, more
curls, smoother skin, better eyes, less wrinkles, larger body parts
in front, less acid, smaller body parts in back, fewer pimples,
better breath, thicker bones, regular heartbeat, punctual bowels,
supple ligaments, more libido, less libido, reduced anxiety, more
sleepiness, more alertness, less depression, clear arteries. There
are diet supplements to get larger and others to get smaller. Some
people even consume those powdery bars of ersatz chocolate. Others
supplement the supplements with alcohol and cheer for the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in place of the $16-billion supplement industry, we
could just eat good foods. Who needs carrot pills if you're munching
carrots? But eating properly is too simple. We're too rushed to chew.
And after all the supplements, we don't have room left for food
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what were we talking about? Right, the ginkgo memory study.
The Journal of the AMA, never a huge fan of over-the-counter
medicines that don't require over-the-desk prescriptions, used
impressive scholarly gobbledygook to say ginkgo didn't do anything
for memory one way or the other. As best we can recall anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The Herb Research Foundation, never a huge fan of associations
that aren't huge fans of alternative medicines, sees the dietary
supplement industry as being under siege. The unregulated industry
has no product standardization, and benefit claims are easier to
suspect than prove. Not surprising when even taking the substance
can't help you remember whether it's gingko or ginkgo.</TE>

<LD>Labor Day weekend launches the lawn signs, mailbox fliers and TV ads
that mark the final push of an increasingly year-round election
season. The biggest decision by far facing Los Angeles voters Nov. 5
is one they've heard about, in one form or another, since the 1970s:
whether to keep the city united or break it apart. Leaders of the San
Fernando Valley secession movement campaigned for five years to get a
breakup measure on the ballot, joined at the last minute by advocates
of Hollywood secession.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, polls suggest that the voters haven't tuned out. They
realize that a split like this carries big risks. A Times poll
released in early July showed secession failing citywide and in
Hollywood, with support in the Valley at 52%. To pass, it must win
both in the areas petitioning to secede and citywide.</LD>
<LD>   The city, no doubt to secession leaders' credit, is paying more
attention to Valley concerns, from potholes to permits. Redistricting
produced another Valley-only City Council seat. The Valley's newfound
power should help erase the stepchild syndrome that secession aimed
to cure.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the more specific secession claims are harder to credit.
Secession leaders argue that the 1.4-million-resident Valley can
succeed as a stand-alone city if Burbank, with a tenth the Valley's
population, can. But it's not that simple. The Valley has been a part
of Los Angeles since 1915, when it was mainly citrus orchards and
open fields. The question is what it would cost--in money, time,
headaches, disruption--to carve off 40% of a city that shares
everything from history to sewage lines.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms on the ballot, Los Angeles would continue to
provide all services to a new Valley city until at least July 1,
2004, because the new city would not have a police force or any other
infrastructure in place. How much longer that arrangement would
continue is anyone's guess. How it would improve services in either
the Valley or what remains of Los Angeles is a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure also calls for a new Valley city, besides
paying for these services, to pay so-called alimony to the remaining
Los Angeles for 20 years to make up for lost tax revenues. Secession
advocates see such a payment as proof that the Valley doesn't get its
"fair share" of services, even though every city uses taxes from
better-off neighborhoods to help deliver basic services to poorer
ones. In these days of tanking stock markets and state and federal
deficits, it's hard to believe we are even talking about alimony
payments, new bureaucracies and the inevitable lawsuit costs.</TE>
<TE>   Like any big, diverse and powerful city, L.A. could always stand
improvement. Voters in recent years have already approved literally
hundreds of reformist changes, from term limits to neighborhood
councils to decentralized planning boards. More sweeping
possibilities, including a division of the city into semi-autonomous
boroughs, should remain under discussion. Breaking up Los Angeles is
not the only option, and certainly not the best option, for
reform-minded voters.</TE>

<HD>School District Ban: Do Sodas and Education Mix?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Schools to End Soda Sales," Aug. 28: The Los Angeles Unified
School District Board of Education has again demonstrated its
arrogance toward the students and parents of Los Angeles. By banning
soda, the board has deemed itself wiser and more caring than the
poor, uneducated, unwashed slobs who deposit their children in their
care.</LD>
<LD>   The board's hypocrisy is astounding. Are there not soda machines
at the Board of Education? Do these "educators" not swing through
Jack in the Box on their way to work?</LD>
<LD>   The parents of L.A. Unified have voted consistently with their
money for soda machines on campus year after year. After all, the
last time I checked, most middle-schoolers don't have jobs.</LD>

<TE>   As a classroom teacher, I witness daily the negative effects that
drinking Coca-Cola and the like have on student efforts. First, they
fly so high they can't concentrate on their work, and then they crash
so low they can't muster the energy to study.</TE>
<TE>   True, most students get their sugar/caffeine supply off campus,
but then students who smoke cigarettes certainly get their nicotine
off campus as well; it would be unthinkable that there be a cigarette
vending machine alongside the ones dispensing candy and soda. It's
absurd for schools to condone and even encourage the consumption of
these beverages in the face of rising obesity and falling test
scores.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlin Lange</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The board decision to ban soda sales is an irresponsible move
because it is not based on analysis of student eating behavior or on
the financial impact on schools of the ban. Let's face it: Banning
soda from school is unlikely to change what kids eat and drink. It
will, however, be a boon for the convenience stores located near most
campuses. More important, the ban will deprive our schools of funds
on which they depend for vital activities such as field trips and
athletics. How arrogant of the board to deprive kids of these
activities without a plan to replace the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford M. Jacoby</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a concerned parent, I applaud the decision to ban soda sales by
the LAUSD. School is supposed to be a place of education. Besides
academics, students learn eating habits, and drinking soda is not a
healthy lifestyle. If soda is available on campus, it is the same
thing as adults telling them that drinking soda is fine. If students
get out of the habit of drinking soda, they will have a chance to
learn about healthful alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is very concerned about the possible loss of income from
soda sales, but alternatives are available. Coca-Cola does not "give"
anything to the schools; it instead gives itself another generation
of consumers for its products by hooking them on sodas at school.</TE>

<TE>   I taught in an inner-city high school for 25 years--and I was
tired of pop cans and bottles littering my classroom, the halls and
the campus. Besides that, some of the drinks contain 10 teaspoons of
sugar. What student needs that? On with fewer cavities and a clean
school!</TE>

<HD>President Moi Led Kenya to Democracy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Kenya's Big Man Is Being Belittled," Aug. 18: Certainly Kenyans
are aware that an era is coming to an end with the retirement of
President Daniel Arap Moi. However, as Kenyans approach their third
multiparty elections in 10 years, they are also aware of the
considerable debt that they owe to the man who has guided the country
from a one-party state to a vibrant parliamentary democracy.
Extraordinary changes have taken place in the country over the last
decade. An open society has evolved in which political opinions of
all shades are expressed with fervor and candor.</LD>
<LD>   It is a distortion to say that the president is booed and heckled
as he crosses the country. But surely the freedom to express
dissenting views is part and parcel of any democracy and is to be
welcomed. Kenya's press is no less forthright in criticizing the
establishment. Is this not a sign of democracy too? There is much
more to be said of the legacy that President Moi will bequeath to the
nation--from the restoration of the once-defunct East African
Community to the vital role of peacemaker in Africa.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, it beggars belief that your article failed to acknowledge
the importance of the massive constitutional review presently
underway in Kenya. It does, in fact, mark the first time in nearly 40
years of independence that the people of Kenya have had the
opportunity of playing a direct role in determining their
constitution. This new constitution--a constitution for the 21st
century--will also be part of President Moi's legacy.</TE>

<LD>So we now have 1.3 million criminals in jail ("Adults Punished for
Crimes Hits Record," Aug. 26). The article intimated this number was
too large. But considering our horrific crime rate, it's obvious to
any reasonable person that the number should be more like 5 million
or 10 million in jail.</LD>
<LD>   It would be interesting to know the number and percentage of
violent crimes being committed by those 4 million probationers and,
particularly, the parolees. Figures I've seen in the past indicate
that those numbers are also horrific.</LD>

<HD>Palestinian Terror's Boomerang Effect</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The reason why The Times believes that the brutal murder of Ikhlas
Khouli, the Palestinian mother of seven, by her own people represents
a "New Phase in Mideast Bloodshed" (Aug. 27) is unclear. After all,
the culprits were the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which proudly takes
credit for the murder of so many Israeli innocents and continues to
do so without fear of reprisal.</LD>
<LD>   To a people who embrace terrorism and murder, publicly celebrate
the death of civilians, honor mass murders, teach and encourage even
their youngest children to kill and have created a culture rooted in
death, why should the murder of Khouli represent something new when
it really is just business as usual?</LD>
<LD>   Many Palestinians have already been murdered by their own people
on a claim, untested by judicial authority, that they "collaborated"
with Israelis or sold land to a Jew. Ironically, right beneath the
conclusion of this article you published one about the arrest of
seven Israeli Arabs for their alleged involvement in the deadly
bombing of a bus. The difference? Unlike Khouli, those Israeli Arabs
will get a fair trial and the opportunity to prove their innocence.</LD>
<TE>   Howard S. Secof</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It defies the imagination of any civilized individual that a
Palestinian terrorist organization would murder the widowed mother of
seven children allegedly because she collaborated with Israel. Is
this Palestinian justice? And to add insult to injury, the
Palestinian governor of the territory where the woman was murdered
blames this outrageous act on Israel. How can peace be achieved with
a people who behave in this fashion?</TE>

<HD>Don't Limit Access to Runyon Canyon</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am amazed that The Times has not found the time to report on the
impending closure of the Vista Street entrance to Runyon Canyon in
Hollywood. This action is being taken without any public input and
will have a terrible impact on the visitors as well as the many
people living around the Fuller Avenue gate who will now have to
contend with the traffic that Vista Street currently handles.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is not just convenience. What happens if there is a fire
in the canyon? Are those who may find themselves cut off from the one
exit expected to just deal with it, simply for the convenience of the
upscale homeowners who have instructed the city to make this
change--a change that is taking effect in spite of the impact on so
many others? Many of the complaints about park visitors and their
dogs are valid and, as a dog owner, I am embarrassed by the behavior
I see almost every day. But the solution is not to start shutting
down access. The solution is to make a real effort to enforce the
laws and regulations. If the city tried that with any real sincerity
we would probably all be a lot happier.</LD>

<DH>Flood of books on attacks differ in approach and tone, but
many seek perspective, answers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No modern event has been as thoroughly documented as the attacks of
Sept. 11, 2001. Yet the torrent of words and images continues. The
publishing industry is marking the first anniversary of the terrorist
attacks by offering readers more than a hundred books relating to
Sept. 11, including about 20 picture books, storybooks and coping
guides for children and young readers.</LD>
<LD>   Reading more about a tragedy that is still so raw and seeing
photographs of events that were witnessed by nearly everyone with a
television will reawaken anger in some Americans. Others may
experience the "closure" that became one of the buzzwords of Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   By telling stories either general or specific, a number of books
detail what happened on that day, eradicating historical amnesia.
Others attempt to explain how and why the attacks occurred, or
consider how we as a nation and as individuals have changed. The
question of what we do now is addressed in discussions of political
policy and debates about the future of lower Manhattan. In some of
the best books, time passed and distance traveled have yielded new
information and fresh perspective.</LD>
<TE>   In the days and weeks after the attacks, many people gorged on
information, as if a surfeit of details could quell disbelief.
"Seeking information is a very basic human impulse when we're faced
with a profound threat," says Nancy Etcoff, a psychologist at Harvard
Medical School. "We try to know everything about the situation that
frightens us so we can better seek safety. The pursuit of information
makes us feel more secure."</TE>
<TE>   The crop of Sept. 11 books varies widely in subject, tone and
quality, ranging from works that will become classics to others
cheesy enough to inspire charges of exploitation. Media coverage of
Sept. 11 has generally been so reverent that charges of profiting
from tragedy have seldom arisen. But the rather taboo question that
hovers over the fetish of commemoration about to be indulged is
whether a national tragedy has become a commodity, as marketable as
toothpaste.</TE>
<TE>   Many books skirt that indictment by donating all or a portion of
their profits to victims' funds. But a book can contribute to charity
and still be silly or shallow. "Where Were You on September 11?," by
Janette Reynolds (Umbrella Publishing), satisfies the curiosity of
anyone who was wondering what Donald Trump or Sarah Ferguson were up
to when disaster struck. "Faces of Hope," by Christine Pisera Naman
(Health Communications), is a collection of portraits of babies born
Sept. 11, one from each of the 50 states. Does either book seriously
honor the dead and their survivors?</TE>
<TE>   There are books designed to instill hope and polemics that aim to
fill the reader with dread. Heartfelt notions morph into cliches;
there's nothing wrong with the idea that hope can rise from the ashes
of sorrow, until repetition transforms it into treacle.</TE>
<TE>   Some books provide a historical record and will enable people who
created private archives of newspapers and magazines to toss them
into recycling bins. A number of stunning collections of
photojournalism guarantee that the visions of Sept. 11 will be
indelible.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to know how successful many of the memorial books
will be. Of the dozens published in the last year, several reached
wide audiences, including "Firehouse," by David Halberstam
(Hyperion), which focuses on a station that lost 12 of its 13 men in
the aftermath of the attacks and has been on bestseller lists since
May. Publishing industry insiders agree that the sheer number of
titles coming out in August and September will likely be
self-defeating.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see which books will do well, because
people will be saturated with information from all the media," says
Morgan Entrekin, publisher of Grove/Atlantic Press, a leading
independent publishing house. "To me, the books that will work are
those that do what only a book can, which is to give you a really
well-reported, in-depth narrative by a fine writer that takes you
into a story."</TE>
<TE>   Entrekin intentionally scheduled publication of "The Lion's
Grave--Dispatches from Afghanistan," by New Yorker correspondent Jon
Lee Anderson in November. "The field is going to be very, very
crowded, and we were happy we didn't have a book in the fray," he
says. "But quality usually wins. Readers have pretty discriminating
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   * Great Expectations--Some of the books expected to be standouts:</TE>
<TE>   "American Ground: Unbuilding the World Trade Center," by William
Langewiesche (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). The publishing world is
buzzing about this account of the recovery and salvage effort and the
community that formed at ground zero, first published in three parts
in Atlantic Monthly. War correspondent Langewiesche, who spent nine
months at the site, writes, "[The workers] hailed from Staten Island,
Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and New Jersey, and most had accents to
prove it. From the start, therefore, the recovery site was what it
remained: an outer-borough New York blue-collar scene--overwhelmingly
Irish, Italian and male, terribly unrepresentative by social
measures, and yet authentic."</TE>
<TE>   "On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald and 9/11--A Story of Loss
and Renewal," by Howard Lutnick and Tom Barbash (HarperCollins).
Cantor Fitzgerald, the company located on the top floors of the World
Trade Center, lost nearly 700 employees, including the brother of CEO
Lutnick. His memoir describes the personal and corporate struggles he
and the other survivors have faced.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of the Blue: The Story of September 11, 2001, From Jihad to
Ground Zero," by Richard Bernstein and the staff of the New York
Times (Times Books). A narrative history of Sept. 11 that chronicles
the events of the day, then backtracks to examine the origins of
Islamic terrorism in Afghanistan and trace the paths of Mohamed Atta
and his terrorist team. Likely to become the definitive history.</TE>
<TE>   "Portraits 9/11/01: The Collected Portraits of Grief from the New
York Times" (Times Books). Beginning Sept. 14, 2001, each day's New
York Times included a page or two filled with brief profiles of men
and women who died at the World Trade Center. The verbal snapshots of
more than 1,900 executives, window washers, bond traders,
dishwashers, stockbrokers and firefighters, in the words of friends
and family members, are testaments to what has been called the
"democracy of death." It is impossible to read the concise,
impressionistic portraits of the real people behind the statistics
and not weep.</TE>
<TE>   "New York September 11" by Magnum Photographers (PowerHouse
Books). The photographers of the legendary co-op agency founded in
1947 routinely travel the world, recording wars and natural
disasters. On Sept. 10, a dozen had gathered at the Magnum offices in
lower Manhattan for a meeting. The next day, they headed into the
streets with their cameras. The best of their work was compiled into
a book with a first printing of 100,000 copies, released Nov. 9. It
sold out. So far, $600,686 in profits have been donated to the New
York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund, and the book, with an introduction by
Halberstam, is being reissued for the anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "Above Hallowed Ground: A Photographic Record of September 11,
2001," by Photographers of the New York City Police Department
(Viking Studio). A record of the attacks, the rescue and recovery
efforts by Det. David Fitzpatrick and other members of the police
department, who had uncommon access, including the opportunity to
shoot from helicopters. The captions simply identify what is being
shown--their understatement lets the extraordinary photos speak more
powerfully.</TE>
<TE>   * Historic Records--Overviews of the events and stories with a
narrow focus, as well as collections of reportage and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "What We Saw: The Events of September 11, 2001, in Words, Pictures
and Video" (Simon &amp; Schuster). With an introduction by Dan Rather,
the CBS news record of the early hours, days and weeks of America's
seismic jolt is culled from transcripts of television and radio
reports and combined with black-and-white photographs. The book is
packaged with a two-hour DVD, anchored by Dan Rather, that presents
original CBS News reports.</TE>
<TE>   "September 11: An Oral History--Real Stories From Ordinary
People," by Dean E. Murphy (Doubleday). Written and compiled by New
York Times reporter Murphy, the book presents eyewitness accounts of
survivors of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as well as
scenes from the lives of people around the world who watched the
events unfold on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Never Forget: An Oral History of September 11, 2001," by Mitchell
Fink and Lois Mathias (Regan Books). The experiences of 81 survivors,
in their own words--a paramedic, a police officer, a quadriplegic who
was carried down 69 floors to safety by 10 colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland," by
Jim DeFede (Regan Books). On Sept. 11, 38 jets heading for the U.S.
were forced to land at Gander International Airport in the central
highlands of Newfoundland. More than 6,500 passengers were stranded.
The people of the surrounding small towns put their lives on hold for
nearly a week to help the "plane people." If this nonfiction account
hadn't been written, a novel about the spirit of community that
filled Gander those days might have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterwords," compiled by the editors of Salon.com (Washington
Square Press). The seven sections of this anthology illustrate the
psychological and political progression of the nation in the wake of
the attacks, from "Ground Zero" and "Nothing Will Be the Same" to
"Collateral Damage" and "Start Making Sense."</TE>
<TE>   * Preserved on Film--Photographs by unknown photographers and
professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "Eleven: Witnessing the World Trade Center 1974-2001," by the
photographers of Contact Press Images (Rizzoli) with an introduction
by Toni Morrison. The 110 photos in the book document the tragedy and
celebrate the towers with images taken since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "The American Spirit: Meeting the Challenge of September 11" (Life
Books). If Life magazine were still being published, its reports on
America's response to the attacks would have looked like this. With
essays by a variety of writers and an introduction by George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "A Nation Challenged: A Visual History of 9/11 and Its Aftermath"
(Callaway Editions). Photojournalism from the New York Times, which
won six Pulitzer prizes for its coverage, with original essays
focused on different aspects of the attack. Although the book
provides a comprehensive record of the event, the presence of charts
and diagrams diminishes the emotional impact of the photos.</TE>
<TE>   "The September 11 Photo Project," edited by Michael Feldschuh
(Regan Books). Selections from an exhibit of amateur photographs that
began in a Soho gallery a month after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Standing Together: America Strong and Proud After 9/11" (Sports
Publishing). Photographs from the New York Daily News. Includes the
day of the attacks, the rescue efforts, the six-month anniversary
tributes, the end of the cleanup efforts at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   "Pilgrimage: Looking at Ground Zero," by Kevin Bubriski
(PowerHouse Books). Like many who couldn't explain their actions,
photographer Bubriski made five pilgrimages from his home in Vermont
to the World Trade Center site to witness and record the impact of
the tragedy. The faces of anonymous mourners his camera captured at
the barricades surrounding the ruins are a shattering portrait of
collective sorrow.</TE>
<TE>   "Faces of Ground Zero" by Joe McNally (Little, Brown). Rescue
workers, firefighters, police and survivors, through the lens of an
8-by-12-foot Polaroid camera.</TE>
<TE>   * Heroes and Survivors--The individuals thrust into the spotlight
by disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Heart of a Soldier: A Story of Love, Heroism and September 11th,"
by James B. Stewart (Simon &amp; Schuster). The story of Rick Rescorla, a
decorated Vietnam veteran and the head of security for Morgan
Stanley, whose actions saved 3,700 of the company's employees spread
throughout 25 floors of the twin towers. Stewart says, "Rescorla's
story is about human nature and our capacity to act on behalf of our
fellow man.... He was one of the few victims of 9/11 who consciously
put his own life at risk, when he wasn't really required to do so, by
knowingly going back into the building at a moment of great peril."</TE>
<TE>   "Among the Heroes: United Flight 93 and the Passengers and Crew
Who Fought Back," by Jere Longman (HarperCollins). New York Times
reporter Longman conducted more than 300 interviews to reconstruct
the most likely series of events on the hijacked United flight that
crashed in the Pennsylvania countryside. His research led to the
conclusion that the passengers on board weren't ordinary people
caught in extraordinary circumstances. They were a special group of
strong, smart, brave individuals perfectly suited to become the first
victors in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Father Mike," by Michael Daly (Thomas Dunne Books). A biography
of the New York Fire Department priest who perished administering
last rites at the World Trade Center, by a New York Daily News
columnist.</TE>
<TE>   "Strong of Heart: Life and Death in the Fire Department of New
York," by Thomas Von Essen (Regan Books). In his memoir, the fire
commissioner relates how he faced the loss of 343 members of the NYFD
and began the process of rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's Roll: Finding Hope in the Midst of Crisis," by Lisa Beamer
and Ken Abraham (Tyndale House). Memoir by the widow of Flight 93
passenger Todd Beamer.</TE>
<TE>   * Looking for Understanding or Blame--Who is the enemy, why do
they hate us, and why did their strategy succeed?</TE>
<TE>   "The Cell: Inside the 9/11 Plot, and Why the FBI and CIA Failed to
Stop It," by John Miller, Michael Stone and Chris Mitchell
(Hyperion). The authors show the failure of anti-terrorism efforts
under three administrations, including the present one. They claim
several opportunities to stop the terrorists were not acted on
because the threat had not exceeded what a State Department official
called an "acceptable level of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a correspondent for ABC News, says, "This is a story I've
been following since 1990. We did this book to promote understanding.
This is not just another book that takes the easy street of bashing
the FBI and CIA and saying that they screwed up. They did an awful
lot right. The people on the ground level were always on the right
trail, and they were often waved off by some bureaucrat upstairs."</TE>
<TE>   "Longitudes &amp; Attitudes: Exploring the World After September 11,"
by Thomas L. Friedman (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). Foreign affairs
columnist for the New York Times and winner of the 2002 Pulitzer
Prize for commentary offers selections from his columns that examine
the angry divide between the Western and Arab worlds.</TE>
<TE>   "The Spirit of Terrorism and Requiem for the Twin Towers," by Jean
Baudrillard, "Ground Zero" by Paul Virilio and "Welcome to the Desert
of the Real," by Slavoj Zizek (all from Verso). Analyses of the
United States, the media and the events surrounding Sept. 11 by three
European philosophers.</TE>
<TE>   "Al-Qaeda: The Terror Network That Threatens the World," by Jane
Corbin (Thunder's Mouth Press). The BBC's senior correspondent in the
Middle East examines the West's response to Sept. 11, declares it a
failure and warns that further attacks should be expected.</TE>
<TE>   "War of Words: Language, Politics and 9/11," by Sandra Silberstein
(Routledge). A professor of English at the University of Washington,
Silberstein probes the stories that were repeated after the attack
for clues to changes in the national character, concluding that
sentimental appeals manipulated a national tragedy into a consumer
opportunity. A metaphor for the book explosion?</TE>
<TE>   "A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack on America," by Malise
Ruthven (Granta Books). The religious and intellectual background of
the terrorist attacks, analyzed by a Middle Eastern scholar.</TE>
<TE>   * Now What?--The political, security and sociological
ramifications of living with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Combating Terrorism: Strategies of Ten Countries," edited by
Yonah Alexander (University of Michigan Press). Essays that evaluate
the counterterrorism policies of 10 nations, including the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "A New World Trade Center: Design Proposals From the World's
Leading Architects," by Max Protetch (Regan Books). Fifty-eight
leading architects' proposals for the space where the towers stood,
based on an exhibition mounted at the author's gallery in January.
The proposals represent different views of the symbolic, economic,
social and political role of architecture, but most conclude that the
core of any rebuilding project should be a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "Critical Views of September 11: Analyses from Around the World,"
edited by Eric Hershberg and Kevin Moore (The New Press). Essays by
an international collection of intellectuals who consider the future

the Bush administration's legislation to combat terrorism on civil
liberties. With original essays by former state Sen. Tom Hayden,
syndicated columnist Robert Scheer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles) and social critic Michael Moore, among others.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS L. JENKINS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He acted like he had all the right moves and the looks to boot: a
shiny brown-and-white fur coat, cool shades and a crisp white T-shirt
that showed off his lean pecs.</LD>
<LD>   But Dick, a 2-year-old Jack Russell terrier, was all dressed up
with no one to play with. There he sat at Doggie Happy Hour at a
suburban Alexandria, Va., hotel this week, looking for another
terrier to get to know.</LD>
<LD>   Dick's chaperon and owner, Andy Messing, bemoaned his friend's bad
luck.</LD>
<TE>   "He thinks he's Elvis reincarnated, but I can't seem to get this
little fella a date," said Messing, 55, who would like a suitable
companion for Dick. "But my God, if we can't find a mate here, where
else is he going to go?"</TE>
<TE>   It may have been a slow night for Dick, who seemed content to be
fawned over by females of the human persuasion, but for the other 50
or so canines that cruised the Doggie Happy Hour at the Old Town
Holiday Inn this week, it was a frolic.</TE>
<TE>   As they do every Tuesday and Thursday evening in the hotel
courtyard, the dogs sipped on water served up cold and munched on dog
biscuits laid out crunchy and generally got tangled up in their
leashes, while their owners threw back beers and
all-you-can-eat-shrimp orders.</TE>
<TE>   "She can't keep from drooling, she's so excited," Diane Farrell,
41, said of her black mutt, Noel.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel management started the pooch party four years ago when they
noticed that some of their patrons brought dogs to the restaurant and
bar but reluctantly had to leave them outside. Now, Dobermans,
Labradors and a slew of mutts come from as far as Richmond, Va., and
Calvert County, Md., to join in the fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Where else can both dogs and people have a good drink and laugh
together?" said Sandra Tellingsworth, 39, who, with her
brown-and-white beagle Smokey, has been a regular for a year. "It's
just one of those novel things you've got to love about living in a
city of dog lovers."</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that a hotel started a happy hour for dogs in
Alexandria. With 18 dog runs, stores that specialize in gourmet
canine treats, and dog biscuits served up like lollipops at shops,
this city of nearly 130,000 just across the Potomac from Washington
has long given canines most-favored-pet status.</TE>
<TE>   For the Holiday Inn, the canine party also has been a nice side
business. It's taken on a life of its own with Doggie Happy Hour
shirts, hats and water bowls, and a Web site:
www.doggiehappyhour.com.</TE>
<TE>   Every Halloween, there's a doggie costume party at which mutts
have been known to appear as Superdog (with cape), Huladog (Shar-Pei
with grass skirt) and Sherlock Holmes. (Alas, the Great Dane in
question carried no pipe.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a significant cash dog for us," said Tim Ruth, the
hotel's food and beverage director. "We try not to talk in terms of
cows on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Only dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Doggie Happy Hour draws as many dog jokes as dogs, especially from
Holiday Inn guests who often drop by and stare in amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a doggone shame," said Justin Greer, a business executive
from Tucson, who has a 4-year-old bulldog. "If I had known, I would
have brought Tobias."</TE>

<LD>"The Story of Ruby Bridges"</LD>
<LD>   by Robert Coles</LD>
<LD>   Ruby is a brave little girl who prays for people's happiness. She
moved to New Orleans with her family in 1957. Ruby was one of the
first black girls to attend a white elementary school. She attended
the William Frantz Elementary School as a first-grader. Even though a
crowd of angry white people called her names and treated her mean,
when Ruby went to school, she stayed nice and calm.</LD>
<TE>   I liked this book because Ruby never gave up. She always believed
in herself.</TE>

<TE>   Pooh wants to know what a best friend is. His friends say that a
friend is someone you can talk to about anything. Pooh and Piglet
talk about everything, like hunting for heffalumps and finding honey.
They talk about the best place for a picnic. Are they best friends?

<TE>   by Nancy Carlson</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a new kid who sits in a wheelchair, and Arnie
makes fun of him. It happens at school.</TE>
<TE>   This is a good book because when Arnie makes fun of him, he ends
up getting hurt and they make fun of him too. He learns his lesson.</TE>

<LD>I should have spent less time primping and more time trying to
scrounge up a copy of our high school yearbook from 1972. Because
while I collected plenty of compliments at my recent class reunion in
Ohio, I didn't recognize most of the classmates handing them out.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that people had changed that much. The guys tended to be
shorter than I recalled, minus the towering afros they'd worn in high
school, and most of the women had added some pounds. Their faces
seemed hardly to have changed, yet I couldn't remember their names.</LD>
<LD>   Not that it seemed to matter much. Everyone else was struggling
too, and nobody bothered with pretense or guessing games. "Your face
looks familiar, but I can't remember your name," was the weekend's
most frequent refrain.</LD>
<TE>   And no one seemed to take much note of our physical changes.
Cleveland, after all, is not L.A., where we are expected to appear
perennially young. There is a different body aesthetic back home, one
that makes accommodations for aging.</TE>
<TE>   By the first night of our reunion weekend, I realized I'd
exercised and starved for naught; the old me would have stacked up
just fine. By our dinner dance on Saturday night, I regretted my
choice of short, black dress and wished I'd opted for something that
sparkled more and showed less leg.</TE>
<TE>   But by Sunday brunch--as we said our goodbyes and joined hands to
pray--I stood amid the stockings and suits in a sundress dotted with
palm trees and realized that what mattered most to these old friends
was not what we're like now, but who we were then.</TE>
<TE>   All weekend long, greetings between long-lost classmates began not
with "What do you do?" but with "Do you remember when ... ?"</TE>
<TE>   I'd expected photos of the kids, updates on careers, occasional
clashes of ego and image among folks who had spent years nursing
grudges or waiting for their chance to shine. Instead, we laughed and
reminisced, resurrected friendships, flirted with old flames.</TE>
<TE>   My high school boyfriend (now married, with six kids) showed up,
to my delight. Dancing with him to the Isley Brothers--eyes closed,
my head resting on his chest--made me feel as if time had stopped. A
glimpse of current beau Johnny on the sidelines, deep in conversation
with one of the prettiest girls from our class, yanked me back to the
present pretty fast.</TE>
<TE>   Time had dulled our memories, of course. It is humbling to realize
that someone you once considered a confidant doesn't remember you at
all, embarrassing to learn that your legacy--the one thing about you
that folks recall--is your loud mouth or short skirts or the time
your girlfriend dumped you in study hall. The things that we seemed
to remember best had nothing to do with grades or SAT scores.</TE>
<TE>   We recalled the times we skipped class for bid whist games and the
sinfully good cookies our cafeteria baked. We talked about pep
rallies and house parties and football games, the teachers we loved
and the ones we hated, the fast-track classmates who crashed and
burned, and those who dropped out of sight without a trace.</TE>
<TE>   We struggled to put high school in its place, with a new
appreciation of the forces that shaped us. Thirty years has brought
life into focus, moved us beyond an accounting that divides us into
successes and failures.</TE>
<TE>   And as we stood and held candles aloft in the dark and honored our
classmates who have died, the angst of the evening seemed to fade.
We've all been challenged; we've all survived. And the grace I felt
in those moments of silence made the weekend worth traveling the
thousands of miles.</TE>
<TE>   It took just one day back home for me to make the transition from
erstwhile teen to the mother of teenage daughters. Waiting for me
were piles of laundry, lists of school supplies, a calendar loaded
with reminders of appointments with doctors, beauticians, the
orthodontist.</TE>
<TE>   But each day in the mail some reminder arrives of my weekend
retreat to my past ... a packet of articles written by a classmate
trying to launch a career in journalism; a book about coin collecting
from a fellow who mistook my polite conversation for interest in his
obsession; a note and photo from a woman I've known since we were in
junior high.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you'd like this. It was great seeing you. Please keep
in touch," she wrote. The picture is from Spirit Night. Johnny is
wearing baggy jeans and a baseball cap turned backward. I'm in white
jeans and a red halter top. We are smiling broadly, dancing with
panache to a hip-hop song that belongs to the current generation.</TE>
<TE>   I hang it on the refrigerator, where it draws chuckles from my
girls. They think we look like two old fogies practicing karate or
casting for trout. I think we look pretty cool ... getting our groove
on at 47, just like we did at 17.</TE>

<LD>Where do you run into the country's worst driving conditions? New
York? Chicago? Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   Try Big Y, Shaw's, Stop &amp; Shop.</LD>
<LD>   Getting behind the wheels of a shopping cart in the average
supermarket makes rush hour look like a bumper-to-bumper seminar in
courtesy.</LD>
<TE>   That's because there are no rules in the supermarket, no traffic
controls, no enforcement, no load limits.</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, backups and pileups and double-and
triple-parking and reckless pushing and ram-and-runs and tush-gating.</TE>
<TE>   There is also crime.</TE>
<TE>   I, personally, was once the victim of a shopping-cart jacking
perpetuated by a yellow-squash-wielding senior whose steely eyes
suggested she would have just as soon taken me out as look at me.</TE>
<TE>   Other than summoning someone to clean up spills--spill, of course,
being an intercom euphemism for an incident too ghastly to broadcast
the details of--supermarkets have failed to address the mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Official action is warranted. Hearings have to be held; laws have
to be passed; perps have to be walked.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, here is what needs to be done:</TE>
<TE>   First off, supermarkets must create traffic patterns. I'm thinking
something like an interstate highway system that circles the store
with on-and offramps.</TE>
<TE>   There also must be traffic lights, stop signs, posted speed
limits, clearly marked no-passing zones, one-way aisles, metered
parking and weigh stations to monitor people using tandem carts.</TE>
<TE>   There also should be service plazas throughout the store where
shoppers can pull off for a nap, a cup of bad coffee and/or to enjoy
bodily-function medleys as performed by an ever-changing chorus of
restroom strangers.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping carts themselves must be made safe. They must be
registered and equipped with turn signals, high beams, brake lights
and air bags.</TE>
<TE>   AAA service, of course, should be available throughout stores to
handle breakdowns, and especially to fix carts when one of the front
wheels gets stuck and you can only go around in circles.</TE>
<TE>   Another must is a public-works truck to salt and sand the floor in
the subarctic produce section when it gets icy there.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of the carnage that routinely takes place
around the checkout counters, where statistics show that more people
are killed every year than in attacks by sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, enforcement must be beefed up to include spot checks,
speed traps and Breathalyzer tests, and these duties should be
performed by trained Smokeys in mirrored sunglasses pushing Crown
Victoria carts.</TE>

<LD>With items ranging from a private master class with tap dancer
Gregory Hines to boxing gloves signed by Sugar Ray Leonard, $110,000
in bids were gaveled-down at an auction for Sage--a child-care center
in South-Central Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   About 175 guests gathered at Christie's auction house in Beverly
Hills for the "Afternoon of Giving" benefit featuring a champagne
reception, hors d'oeuvres and live auction.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1994, Sage is a before-and after-school center for
children ages 5-12 who live in Nickerson Gardens, "the largest
housing development west of the Mississippi," said Cathy Tate, center
director.</LD>
<TE>   Operated by Crystal Stairs Inc. (a nonprofit provider of
child-care services) in collaboration with the Black Women's Forum,
Nickerson Gardens Resident Management Corp. and Project Build, Sage
gives kids the opportunity to take part in computer classes, math,
science, music and dance.</TE>
<TE>   "Sage is about empowerment--giving a community a voice," said
Tate. "We work with children to develop their social skills and bring
them the enhanced activities that other children get in other
places." If not for the care center, the 100 children enrolled would
most likely be "going home to empty houses because their parents are
working or in school," Tate said. Seventy-five children are on the
center's waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Guests at the auction included Kookie Murray, who credits Sage
with providing a safe environment for her family while she studied
psychology at Cal State Dominguez. She was able to move out of the
housing development five years ago. "Without Sage, I'd still be
sitting in Nickerson Gardens," said Murray, who attended the benefit
with her children, Kyonna, 19; Reginald, 13; and Kyonta, 12.</TE>
<TE>   A poised Kyonna said the teachers at Sage taught her about
self-esteem. "They taught me how to value myself and I became less
shy."</TE>
<TE>   Reginald liked the computer games he got to play at the center.
"And the help with my homework," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   For Kyonta, Sage was the place where she learned the meaning of
the word "respect," she said. "I learned how important it is to be
respectful of the teachers, the other kids and myself."</TE>
<TE>   Guests at the Aug. 24 auction included Karen Hill-Scott, a
developmental psychologist and educator who co-founded Crystal Stairs
with Alice Walker Duff in 1980. "The name of our organization was
inspired by a line in the Langston Hughes poem, 'Mother to Son,' "
she said. "In it, a mother tells her boy never to give up, to keep on
climbing, because, for her, 'Life ain't been no crystal stair.' We
want to inspire that never-give-up attitude in our kids."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Call of the Wild</TE>
<TE>   Forget the standard Cosmopolitan. At Zoofari, "Congo-politans" and
Jungle Juice--a nonalcoholic version of the cocktail classic--were
the beverages of choice. They went well with such appetizers as Bongo
Bruschetta and Tom-Tom Torta.</TE>
<TE>   The sound of drumming welcomed more than 350 guests to the 10th
anniversary dinner dance for the Santa Ana Zoo, where party-goers are
just as likely to talk to the animals as they are to one another.
Presented by Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo support group, "Drums in
Paradise" raised more than $75,000 to upgrade habitats and create new
exhibits at the 20-acre zoological garden that is home to more than
200 animals.</TE>
<TE>   Honored at the event were past gala chairs Paige and Jay Kunkle,
Debbie and Tom Newmeyer, and Donel and Bill Wiles. "This zoo is a
jewel in the back pocket of Orange County," said Debbie Newmeyer,
who, inspired by the safari dress code, paired a sleek Dolce &amp; Gabana
animal-print skirt with a black top. The Newmeyers have chaired six
of the Zoofari galas. "I love the zoo because it's a place where
families can come, spend the day, and learn about animal and plant
conservation," Debbie said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides watching fire jugglers, getting their fortunes told and
schmoozing with a muscular "Tarzan"--"He's wearing next to nothing!"
Tom Newmeyer observed--guests toured the zoo, had their mugs snapped
with squawking parrots and dined under the stars.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Pignone was chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming Up</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles Ronald McDonald House presents the 11th annual Mac
Tonight benefit Sept. 14 for its residential facility for families of
children undergoing cancer treatment. The event, featuring Big Macs
and fries served under glass, will be held at the McDonald's
Production Center in the City of Industry. Tickets: $175 per person.
Call (323) 644-3000.</TE>

<LD>Seven-year-old Samantha was playing with her baby doll while her
mother sat at the desk paying some bills.</LD>
<LD>   All of a sudden Samantha yelled, "Oh, you naughty girl!" She
snatched her doll from the cradle and shook her with such force the
doll's head bobbed back and forth.</LD>
<LD>   Mother jumped from her chair and took the doll from Samantha.
"Shaking is bad," she said. "Even though it's just a doll, you must
learn while you are young never to shake. If you shook a real baby,
you could severely hurt it!"</LD>
<TE>   Samantha was puzzled. She didn't know it was wrong to shake her
doll. "Can I shake the kitty when he plays with the lace curtains?"</TE>
<TE>   "No!" Mother said. "You might seriously injure your kitty if you
did. There are better ways to teach good behavior. Babies and animals
are not to be shaken. Now come and help me in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Mother emptied the few remaining grains of salt in the crystal
salt shaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, Samantha. Take this funnel and use it to refill the shaker
with salt."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha did as she was told. "I guess it's OK to shake the salt,"
Samantha said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother smiled. "That's right. And it's also all right to shake
throw rugs, and some medicines before we take them, or even hands
when we greet someone. But we must never, ever shake babies or
animals!"</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's OK to shake some things," Samantha grinned. "When we
play Monopoly, we shake the dice really hard."</TE>
<TE>   Mother looked pleased. That's right. "Now shake a leg and we'll go
for a treat--an ice cream shake!"</TE>
<TE>   Samantha shook her head and raced out the door.</TE>

<HD>YSL Seizes Imagination by Leaving Little to It</HD>
<DH>Designer Tom Ford's lacy blouse receives tremendous
exposure, much as a wearer would</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before a single stitch of fall clothing hung from store racks, before
the weighty fall fashion magazines landed with a thud and before
anyone really thought about what they were going to wear in the
waning months of 2002, one black blouse seemed to be everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   It had everything necessary to be a showstopper: sex appeal,
distinctiveness and a major designer's name in the label--Tom Ford
for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. As one of fall's most graphic
romantic tops, it became shorthand for the season's hot blouse trend.</LD>
<LD>   The most distinctive feature of the $2,595 YSL top is a black
satin ribbon that laces provocatively across the wide divide of a
waist-deep plunge. In fact, the lacing appears to be about the only
thing keeping the nearly see-through blouse attached to a very bare
body.</LD>
<TE>   Immediately after Ford put two versions of that black blouse on
the YSL runway back in March, photos of it began to appear in
newspapers, in magazines and on the Internet. One photo showed the
willowy model Eugenia in a black lace version worn with a sleek,
knee-length velvet skirt. The other style, in sheer black chiffon,
was worn by top model Carmen Kass, who managed to look sexy even
though she was wearing a controversial item that many hoped and
prayed would never reappear on the YSL runway--knickers, these in
velvet with bows at the knees.</TE>
<TE>   It will probably be the image of Kass in the little-boy pants and
the seductive blouse that becomes the lasting impression of the fall
YSL collection. And if history is any guarantee, Ford most likely
knew it when he put the two together. The market-savvy designer often
predicts which items will be his bestsellers. A year ago, his sultry,
off-shoulder peasant blouses unleashed knockoffs and a peasant trend
that's still going strong.</TE>
<TE>   Though few of the new blouses are available for sale, they have
already become part of the popular culture of fall fashion. "It
starts at the show," said Jaqui Lividini, senior vice president of
fashion merchandising for Saks. "The whole thing begins with the
model Tom Ford selects to wear the pieces that he thinks are the most
outstanding. The press feeds on that. When it's an important model in
the perfect outfit, you'll get tremendous editorial exposure on a
certain piece immediately following the show. Then the magazines use
it in their editorials, and stores select it for their advertising."
Pretty soon, every fashion-obsessed shopper has her name on a waiting
list.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the making of an iconic piece," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford is very good at doing those pieces that sum up the season,"
said Michael Macko, publicity director for Saks Fifth Avenue, which
featured the chiffon lace-up blouse in its New York store windows.
"The blouse is very complicated to put on," said Macko, who saw
stylists struggling with it for a Saks photo shoot. "You'd
practically need a dresser."</TE>
<TE>   Defiant and seemingly gravity-defying, the blouse is a bit of
fashion magic. Though the wide-apart lacing seems as if it's barely
attached to the blouse, the construction is actually a complex
arrangement of bows, buttons and cufflink-like hooks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's the very intrigue. Like the plunging green Versace
dress that Jennifer Lopez made famous at the Grammy Awards two years
ago, this YSL blouse appears to be so precariously attached that a
mere breeze, or a clever lover, could instantly remove it. That's not
exactly what got retailers excited, however.</TE>
<TE>   The look also signaled a strong new direction in evening wear.
"The next generation of cocktail dressing is the romantic and elegant
evening blouse with the skirt," said Lividini. "It's a very important
trend for us." The blouse also features ribbons at the elbows, adding
the all-important new sleeve detail.</TE>
<TE>   In a partnership with Saks for the Fashion Targets Breast Cancer
campaign, a current Mercedes-Benz ad features the new CLK 500 coupe
on one page and a photo of a model in the YSL blouse on another page.
The tacky double-entendre tag line? "You give in to its sensuality.
Your heart races as you take in every curve." (They forgot to say:
"And while you're nearly naked, get a mammogram.")</TE>
<TE>   Compared with some of the shaggy-dog and decidedly unsexy sweaters
that cropped up in the fall collection, the bare blouse was one of
the most alluring articles of the season. Some debate, however, if
the YSL version will reach the level of icon.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions and millions of garments are created each decade," said
Katy Rodriguez, co-owner of the designer vintage boutique
Resurrection in New York and Los Angeles. "When you stop and look
back, there are very few that become these icons of fashion."
Rodriguez said that because the peasant look has already had so much
exposure, she doubts that one blouse could rise above to register in
history. "When designers get a new idea," she said, "they tend to
feed off that idea for a couple more collections."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles designer Allen B. Schwartz is known for identifying
hot-ticket items and getting them in his A.B.S. collection quickly.
"Tom Ford didn't start that YSL lace top," he said. "Lace is a trend.
If lace wasn't hot, that top wouldn't mean anything." Schwartz has a
$200 lace-up black lace blouse that comes with a camisole in his fall
collection. He's already sold 800 to stores, and he thanks the
generous YSL marketing for bringing public attention to the look.
Across the Atlantic, London's Topshop already has featured copies of
the blouse in its windows.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew this trend was happening," said Schwartz. "And this
is just confirmation."</TE>
<TE>   The blouse may have been selected not just for its sex appeal or
trendiness, however. As a runway photographer for 15 years, New
Yorker Maria Valentino can judge when an item is going to sell a lot
of pictures. Because Ford's YSL collection was almost entirely black,
very few photos of it registered any kind of detail.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing showed up very well unless there was some graphic
element," she said. "This was something that would reproduce very
well."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have seen the blouse admit that it's a difficult sell,
especially at $2,595.</TE>
<TE>   "It does seem kind of limited," said Valentino, "but it's awfully
sexy."</TE>

<KH>MILITARY STRATEGY</KH>
<HD>Mapping the Minds in Iraq's Regime</HD>
<DH>Social scientists take aim at Saddam Hussein</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Vice President Dick Cheney said last week that the United States
would "consider all possible options" in defeating Iraq, few knew one
of the options was a team of social scientists and mathematicians
busily trying to get inside the mind of Saddam Hussein in order to
topple him from power.</LD>
<LD>   At the core of this secret U.S. effort is "influence net"
modeling. In essence, influence nets consist of psychological
profiles of political actors and graphic depictions of their
relationships. They suggest how decisions are made and implemented.
In short, the nets are diagrams of who influences whom, how that
influence is exerted and why. In the last decade, intelligence and
military analysts have increasingly relied on such tools to support
planning, targeting and operations.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, says one military proponent of this approach, called
"effects-based" warfare, is that "not everything that counts can be
counted, and not everything that can be counted counts." On the other
hand, the scale of the U.S. effort since Sept. 11 to understand and
influence the behavior of its adversaries, in particular Saddam
Hussein, should give some solace to those who believe that war
planning for Iraq is driven by a mindless cabal.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. analysts and war planners have used influence-net modeling to
assist in their decision-making since 1994. The seed was planted
during the Persian Gulf War, when analysts used the concept to "map"
the central points in Iraq's air defense, communications and
electrical infrastructures. Today, this "nodal" planning is being
applied to human behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Computerization and the availability of vast amounts of news-media
material have facilitated the development of software, called
"natural language processors," that can extract relevant data on a
country's political actors. From this information, their
psychological profiles are constructed and their relationships with
other political figures charted. Armed with this psychological
knowledge, analysts try to determine how several possible U.S.
actions might affect the subjects' behavior.</TE>
<TE>   This approach works something like this. The Republican Guards are
often said to be Saddam Hussein's last-stand protectors. But
analysts, monitoring communications and the interactions of the
guards, have constructed influence-net models that identify certain
special presidential guard units and secret police organizations as
the only parties with direct access to Hussein. Hence, they are
better prospective targets than other concentrations of Republican
Guards if the military goal is to poke holes in the Iraqi leader's
protective screen.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Wagenhals and Alexander Levis of George Mason University
employ a software suite called CAESAR to tease out the beliefs and
reasoning underlying military operations. CAESAR incorporates two
influence-net applications: the Situational Influence Assessment
Module, developed at Science Applications International Corp.; and
the Campaign Assessment Tool, developed by the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   In these influence nets, "node" represents a political actor's
statement or belief. The probability that the belief or statement
will play a role in a decision is given a value. Various weblike
diagrams and color schemes represent the links and strengths of the
actors' relationships. If one "parental" actor (say, a very close
Saddam Hussein advisor) is influenced in some way (he learns about an
assassination plot targeting his boss), a "network" of cascading
effects on the "children" (lesser advisors) is drawn. The network of
relationships and reactions, called "branches" and "sequels" by the
military, represents the behavioral implications of different U.S.
actions.</TE>
<TE>   CAESAR was used in 2000 and 2001 at the Naval War College during
its "global" war game series. Analysts from the Office of Naval
Intelligence and the Defense Intelligence Agency provided real-world
intelligence about the beliefs and reasoning processes of an
Iraq-like adversary, from which an influence-net model was created. A
team using influence-net models tested destructive, electronic
warfare and psychological actions to see if any was especially
decisive in bringing about the commander's goals. One question posed
was how to force one side to back down without resorting to the use
of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the institution responsible for pulling influence-net
modeling together for real-world operations is the Joint Warfare
Analysis Center (JWAC), a Defense Department organization. After the
Gulf War, many inside the military recognized the need to upgrade
targeting science to match weaponry's new precision. With 200
engineers, scientists and analysts, the Pentagon unit was initially
assigned responsibility for targeting enemy electrical,
communications, transportation and petroleum networks for precision
attack. In the late 1990s, however, it was given the expanded mission
of assessing the broader political, economic and social effects of
alternate courses of military action.</TE>
<TE>   By the Yugoslavia war in 1999, JWAC had 515 employees and a
$75-million budget. The Clinton administration relied on it to
predict the extent of collateral damage caused by U.S. military
attacks in urban areas. But JWAC's real innovation was computer-aided
analysis that allowed the most sensitive intelligence and imagery to
be merged with tens of millions of pieces of information. This
information was later used to build influence-net models focusing on
the behavior of leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, JWAC assisted the CIA in "mapping" Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic's inner circle. Using academic models such as the
Kansas Event Data System and the Protocol for the Assessment of
Nonviolent Direct Action, analysts profiled the psychologies of
Yugoslavia's key decision-makers and their interactions and
relationships. Other secret models--the "Arena" and "J-quad IO
model"--were used to understand Yugoslavia's command, control and
computer systems. All this provided the intelligence basis for a
covert strategy that, among other things, aimed to harass the
Milosevic family and to disrupt its crony financial interests.</TE>
<TE>   JWAC had become, in the words of one of its prominent proponents,
a "national treasure," though it is virtually unheard of outside
secret military-planning circles. Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld, in recognition of the unit's importance, has called for the
Pentagon to broaden its multidisciplinary capability "to depict
adversaries as complex, adaptive systems."</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 11, JWAC was charged with replicating, then tracking, the
inner workings of nine potential U.S. adversaries, among them Iraq.
Since then, it has added tools to analyze Afghanistan and target
terrorist networks. For Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan,
JWAC, using its innocuously named Research, Integration and
Technology Environment capability, provided Central Command with a
near-real-time picture of the leaderships of Al Qaeda and the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   While JWAC has become very good at analyzing physical
infrastructure like electrical power grids, insiders question how
good it is at "nonmaterial" analysis. In the case of a country like
Iraq, JWAC and intelligence analysts not only try to know what Saddam
Hussein actually values and how his inner circle functions, but they
also want to learn how such nonmaterial factors as domestic politics,
succession anxieties and dissident control affect their thinking and
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no guarantee that two groups of very good experts would
not draw very different [influence] nets," one participant in the
global war games said. "However, if they did draw different networks,
and they saw one another's, they would have an excellent mechanism
for debating." The tools' greatest power is in "getting people to
focus on what matters."</TE>
<TE>   Rear Adm. Curtis Kemp, who commanded the "blue" forces in the war
games, reviewed the usefulness of influence-net modeling in the games
less than two weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks. Impressed with the
tool, he said one couldn't undertake effects-based warfare without a
deep understanding of an adversary's thinking. He lamented,
nevertheless, that such modeling had not been used at the beginning
of the war games to "help formulate effects and define 'decisive'
points." In other words, the mission and strategy were not shaped by
the insights generated by the influence nets. Instead, the nets were
merely tools to test the commander's intuition and decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Will the team of social scientists and mathematicians be
successful in finding the key to toppling Hussein?</TE>
<TE>   A military study on JWAC analysis concluded that it "is no better
than the questions [it] is asked and the direction it is given." Yet,
proponents of JWAC and influence-net modeling contend that the tools
themselves become important factors in military decisions. When it
comes to Hussein, one high-level Air Force source says, not only is
influence-net modeling useful to determine his true inner circle of
advisors, but it also can track events that might presage shifts in
loyalty or action against his regime.</TE>
<TE>   Nerds at JWAC may not achieve regime change all by themselves. But
their work should be part of the public's understanding that war with
Iraq entails more than either newfangled precision air power and
special operations as applied in Afghanistan, or the traditional
warfare forms that favor a grinding ground battle.</TE>

<HD>The Reality Factor in Educating Children About Sept. 11</HD>

<AU>ABRAHAM COOPER and HAROLD BRACKMAN</AU>
<BD>Rabbi Abraham Cooper is associate dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. Harold Brackman, a historian, is a consultant to
the center.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the first anniversary of 9/11 approaching, Americans have a
special obligation to teach our children not to forget. But what are
we supposed to remember? At least six things.</LD>
<LD>   * Don't be afraid of the truth about the terrorist war against
America. Last Sept. 11, Middle Eastern fanatics attacked the United
States without provocation. More than 3,000 people were killed.
Politically correct euphemisms and evasions shouldn't hide the
fingerprints of those responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the National Education Assn.'s "lesson plans" concerning one
of the most infamous days in U.S. history promotes historical
amnesia. It urges teachers to "address the issue of blame factually"
but then obscures the truth with the caveat: "Blaming is especially
difficult in terrorist situations because someone is at fault. In
this country, we still believe that all people are innocent until
solid, reliable evidence from our legal authorities proves
otherwise."</LD>
<TE>   A year later, does the NEA still harbor doubts that there is
"solid, reliable evidence" establishing the guilt of Al Qaeda and
Osama bin Laden's global "jihad against the Crusaders and the Jews"?
Why is it so difficult to find someone at fault?</TE>
<TE>   * There is no contradiction between teaching positive values and
identifying our enemies. The NEA promises that its 9/11 Web site will
feature the Declaration of Independence, Franklin D. Roosevelt's
"Four Freedoms" speech and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream"
speech. But why stop there? All these great declarations affirmed
freedom, yet none had difficulty identifying freedom's enemies--from
King George III, to dictatorship, to segregation. King refused to
demonize his opponents but knew that he was on God's side--and Jim
Crow was not--in the struggle for racial justice. It is no sin to
know who's on our side--and who isn't--in a just war against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   * Americans must reject collective guilt and have zero tolerance
for hate crimes against any group. We need to zealously defend our
diversity and acceptance of people from a multiplicity of backgrounds
and creeds. The vast majority of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans
proudly belong to our nation's "gorgeous mosaic." They have no
connection with terrorist attacks. The war on terrorism cannot become
an invitation to attack these and other loyal Americans. Any threats
against these minority communities should be denounced by people of
goodwill and prosecuted as hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't blame the victim for the terrorist atrocities committed
against us. Here too the NEA is an unreliable guide. It urges
teachers to "discuss historical instances of American intolerance"
such as the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor and
the backlash against Arab Americans during the Gulf War, so Americans
can avoid "repeating terrible mistakes." Fair enough. But such
cautionary tales can't substitute for teaching about what really
happened on 9/11, and why. What we need are lesson plans exploring
the deadly parallel between the current war on terrorism and the
surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Why were Americans
unprepared in 1941 and again in 2001?</TE>
<TE>   * Teaching about the challenges of terrorism should begin early.
We should not overload impressionable young minds, but we can't wait
until the 12th grade to begin to enlighten young people about 21st
century threats. The NEA believes that it's never too early to teach
sex education, and maybe it's right. But why not also begin teaching
patriotism and our obligation to defend the nation from enemies,
foreign and domestic, in the elementary grades?</TE>
<TE>   * Why America's fights have to be carried beyond the classroom.
During World War II, movie maker Frank Capra produced a documentary
film series, "Why We Fight," to educate both soldiers and civilians.
While there has been a recent rash of feel-good patriotic films, much
more needs to be done to solidify the 9/11 generation's understanding
of why we are in this war.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a year into our war against terror, there should be a
consensus on at least this much: An international Arab and Islamic
terrorist movement, formerly headquartered in Afghanistan but now
dispersed, has declared war on the United States. These enemies have
convinced a significant minority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims
that their religion justifies a jihad, or holy war, against the
United States. Their aim is not merely to drive the United States out
of the Middle East and obliterate Israel but to destroy our
democratic society.</TE>
<TE>   Before World War II, the Western democracies did not take Adolf
Hitler's "Mein Kampf" seriously enough until it was too late. Even
after war came in 1939, they fought a phony war until German and
Japanese successes left them no choice but to fight for their lives.
Today, we should not be lulled into complacency by early successes in
Afghanistan. It would also be a terrible mistake to revert to the
rhetoric of partisan politics.</TE>
<TE>   The new terrorist international has open or tacit help from many
Arab regimes and the support, nearer home, of followers of such
extremist clerics as Sheik Omar Bakri Mohammed in London and
imprisoned Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in the U.S. It is deadly serious
about its war on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   To partly understand what its victory would mean, just look at
Afghanistan under the Taliban, where non-Muslims were forced to wear
the special insignia of second-class citizens; at Pakistan, where no
Christian or Jew is safe; at Egypt, where the Copts are prohibited
from building or renovating churches; at the Philippines, where
Muslim terrorists kidnap and behead Christian missionaries; at
Nigeria, where a divorced mother is under sentence of death for
having sex; or at the Sudan, where more than 2 million non-Muslim
blacks have been killed or enslaved.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will militarily defeat the global terrorist coalition
that seeks our destruction. But victory will be only half won until,
on the home front, we teach our children and convince ourselves that
affirming decency while battling evil are the twin towers that will
secure American values and our future.</TE>

<LD>As children across California strap on their backpacks and return to
school, parents are crossing their fingers. They know intuitively
what numerous studies have shown: The single most important influence
on a child's achievement is the teacher. And in our state, these
days, a child's chance of encountering a highly skilled, well-trained
and caring teacher is a lot smaller than it should be.</LD>
<LD>   In a 2001 poll, 87% of Californians identified well-qualified
teachers in every classroom as the key to raising student
achievement, far ahead of reforms like vouchers or testing. When
asked what makes a good teacher, they listed knowledge about teaching
and learning first, followed by knowledge of classroom management and
subject matter.</LD>
<TE>   But in California schools, more than 40,000 teachers--nearly 15%
of the total--lack these basic qualifications. California has more
emergency-credentialed teachers than in 25 other states combined.
Last year, in addition to 37,000 teachers working on emergency
permits, who had not met the state's standards for content knowledge
or teaching skills, about 2,500 teachers were working on waivers
without having passed even the state's basic skills test. Others are
teaching on "intern" or "pre-intern" credentials while they finish
their training. These teachers make up well over half the staff in
some schools serving large concentrations of low-income and minority
students. These are often the same schools that lack textbooks,
supplies, adequate facilities and decent working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for this situation are now familiar. Proposition 13
led to reduced funding to schools while enrollments were growing.
Salaries slipped and class sizes grew. Then, state law requiring
smaller class sizes increased demand for teachers and led rich
districts to raid poor districts for qualified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Less acknowledged is how much these disparities affect learning.
At least four recent studies in California have found that, after
controlling for student poverty and conditions like class size, the
proportion of emergency-credentialed teachers in a school
significantly lowers student achievement on state tests. As student
promotion and graduation are now tied to these tests, requiring
higher standards for kids without requiring any standards for their
teachers threatens to leave more and more children behind.</TE>
<TE>   No Child Left Behind--the federal law passed last year to improve
education for underserved students--was intended to remedy this
situation. It not only requires states to test every child every
year, with rewards and sanctions attached to the scores, it also
requires that states provide all children with "highly qualified"
teachers by 2005-06. It defines these teachers as being fully
certified by the state and having demonstrated competence in the
subjects they teach. Funds are provided to states to help them
implement plans to reach this goal.</TE>
<TE>   Seems like a sensible idea. But rather than formulate a plan to
get qualified teachers into all the state's classrooms, the State
Board of Education instead tried to define away the problem by
proposing to set the standards for "highly qualified teachers" at the
level currently required of those who enter teaching on emergency
permits. The U.S. Department of Education said it could not accept
this definition, and California is back at the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   Although the situation looks daunting, it is fixable, as other
states and districts have shown. The problems in staffing California
schools are not caused by shortages of qualified individuals in the
state or the nation. Nationally and in California, there are two to
three times as many certified teachers in the population as there are
in the schools. Many states in the Midwest and New England have
teacher surpluses. Most of the "shortages" exist because people are
unwilling to work in cities and poor rural districts that pay less
than those in the suburbs and have larger classes and fewer
resources.</TE>
<TE>   Such disparities plague California. In 2001, beginning teacher
salaries ranged from $23,000 to $45,000. After adjusting for cost of
living, there was a 3-1 ratio between the starting salaries offered
by Vallecito Union, a high-achieving Calaveras County district with
no uncertified teachers, and Alum Rock Union, a low-performing San
Jose district where 34% of all teachers are not fully certified.
Economist Michael Pogodzinski found that California districts
offering lower salaries than others in their county have more
emergency hires.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have found that teachers who are underprepared leave
their jobs at much higher rates than those who are fully certified.
About 35% of emergency-credentialed teachers leave within the first
year, and more than 60% never receive a credential. Teachers who are
unprepared are typically shocked by the number of things they don't
know how to do; feel inadequate in meeting the needs of the wide
range of students in their classes; and experience more stress and
less success than teachers who have learned how to organize a
classroom, motivate and engage students and plan curriculums. By
contrast, at least 70% of prepared teachers generally remain in the
profession after five years. Mentoring also matters. Teachers who
receive intensive one-on-one classroom mentoring during their first
year also stay at much higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing attrition is one of the most important ways to meet the
demand for teachers because it accounts for most of the supply
problem and wastes precious resources. According to the Texas Center
for Educational Research, it costs about $8,000 to recruit, hire and
orient a replacement teacher--money that could be better spent
helping teachers become more effective in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   When conditions improve, qualified teachers appear and stay. The
recent experience of New York City is instructive. A state mandate
that uncertified teachers could no longer be placed in low-performing
schools--along with the requirements of the new federal law--led to
improvements in hiring practices and a 16% increase in teachers'
salaries to make them more comparable to the surrounding suburbs. The
coming school year's vacancies were filled by July, and 90% of the
new hires are fully certified, in contrast with only 60% the year
before. The remaining 10% will be certified within the year.</TE>
<TE>   Some California cities serving large proportions of low-income and
minority students have done the same. New Haven Unified, which serves
Union City in Alameda County, has long been known for having
surpluses of teachers because of its single-minded focus on getting
and keeping those who are well-qualified. Anaheim and San Diego have
recently turned the corner, hiring almost all certified teachers last
year by combining aggressive recruitment from local colleges and out
of state with increased salaries, improved working conditions in
high-need schools and mentoring supports. These initiatives benefited
from policies recently enacted to help recruit and retain qualified
teachers in high-need schools--even if these are not yet on a scale
sufficient to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   When purpose is joined with persistence, these problems can be
solved. Connecticut is a case in point: It went from 20 years of
teacher shortages in its major cities to surpluses statewide within
three years by increasing salaries until it was the top-paying state
in the nation and equalizing the pay across districts. At the same
time, the state improved teacher education and mentoring, provided
scholarships for teaching candidates in high-need fields and
eliminated emergency credentialing. Connecticut's schools became
among the best in the nation, even as they served a growing share of
students from low-income and immigrant families.</TE>
<TE>   California--the largest and wealthiest economy in the nation and
the fifth-largest in the world--can and should do the same. A
high-tech economy like ours cannot run well without a highly skilled
labor force. In the poll mentioned earlier, eight out of 10
Californians agreed that "we should ensure that all children,
including those who are economically disadvantaged, have teachers who
are fully qualified, even if that means spending more money to
achieve that goal."</TE>
<TE>   Education can be a strong weapon in the fight against crime. Most
prison inmates are functionally illiterate, and 40% of adjudicated
juveniles have learning disabilities that were not diagnosed in
school. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, criminal justice
expenditures in California grew by 900% while spending for education
grew by less than 25% in real-dollar terms. A year in prison for one
inmate costs taxpayers up to $30,000. Average costs per pupil in
grades K-12 are now less than $6,000. We can pay for qualified
teachers now or for prisons later. It's California's choice.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If President Bush goes to war against Iraq, he'll be abandoning
traditional Republican foreign policy. The most fervent objections to
war against Saddam Hussein are coming from members of the old guard
of the Republican Party. Former National Security Advisor Brent
Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, for
example, are waging battle against neoconservatives who they believe
are hijacking Bush administration foreign policy.</LD>
<LD>   The opponents of war view the neocons as intoxicated with the idea
of American hegemony and obsessed with Israel's security. As a
result, the GOP is locked in a mini-civil war over whether to follow
the legacy of Ronald Reagan or the elder George Bush.</LD>
<LD>   For most of its history, the Republican Party has followed the
tenets laid down by the patron saint of realism, Theodore Roosevelt.
Despite all his bellicose bombast, TR, as his biographer Edmund
Morris notes, was a peacemaker. He was reluctant to enter into wars
and skeptical of expanding democracy abroad. He devoted much of his
presidency to peace conferences. Above all, Roosevelt believed in
spheres of influence and staying out of international organizations.</LD>
<TE>   As Europe and Asia descended into fascism and war, the GOP's
Roosevelt-inspired attitudes hardened. It was Republicans who were
ardent America Firsters. In the immediate aftermath of World War II,
they reverted to type. The GOP's leader, Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft,
voted against the Marshall Plan, calling it "globaloney." He opposed
the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and was
antagonistic to the Korean War. To "old right" writer Garet Garrett,
the United States had "crossed the boundary that lies between
Republic and Empire."</TE>
<TE>   By then, however, anti-communism had legitimized foreign
intervention for most conservatives. Richard M. Nixon and Henry
Kissinger may have deepened America's involvement in Vietnam, but
they were true realists. There was no room in their foreign policy
for human-rights considerations and crusades for democracy. On the
contrary, they were obsessed with power relationships and spheres of
influence. Such ruthless attitudes enabled them to cut deals with
ideological foes like the Soviet Union and China.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of neoconservativism and Reaganism in the 1970s, however,
augured a different approach. A small band of intellectuals, notably
Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz, began converting Republicans to
a Wilsonian crusading mentality. The neocons contended that both the
isolationism of the Democratic Party, under Sen. George S. McGovern,
and the amoralism of the GOP, under Kissinger, had it wrong.
Democratic Sens. Henry "Scoop" Jackson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan
gave them political influence and legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   The neocons founded the Committee on the Present Danger, one of
whose members was Donald H. Rumsfeld, the current secretary of
Defense. The U.S. military was falling dangerously behind its Soviet
counterpart, they warned. America needed to confront communism, not
appease it.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan embraced the ideas of the neoconservatives. As president,
he beefed up the defense budget and created the National Endowment
for Democracy. Dozens of neocons served in his administration, among
them Elliott Abrams, Richard N. Perle and Paul D. Wolfowitz. Above
all, Reagan rejected the idea of passively containing the Soviet
Union. His invasion of Grenada, as well as his support for the Afghan
rebels and Nicaraguan Contras, were essentially go-it-alone
undertakings that were intended to take the battle to the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush, by contrast, promptly retreated from
these in-your-face policies. He had little interest in continuing the
Contra program. When the Berlin Wall fell, he didn't exactly
celebrate it, worrying that a collapsing Soviet Union meant a great
deal more instability in the world. (Contrast this with Reagan's
injunction to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to "tear down
this wall.")</TE>
<TE>   And though his administration did go to war with Iraq, it was only
after Bush had painstakingly assembled an international coalition to
back him up. In short, Bush was hostage to the ideas of realists like
Colin L. Powell and Scowcroft. It was Scowcroft and Powell--then
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now secretary of State--who
stopped the Gulf War before U.S. forces marched into Baghdad. It was
Scowcroft and Powell who shunned humanitarian considerations and
refused to get the U.S. involved to stop the marauding Serbs in the
Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it is neocons like Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of Defense;
Perle, chair of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board; and Abrams, a
National Security Council member--along with William Kristol, editor
of the Weekly Standard--who are the brains behind Bush's push to
expel Hussein. Without them, there would be no war talk. What's more,
many neocons believe that the U.S. should target Saudi Arabia too.</TE>
<TE>   To the realists, nothing could be more dangerous. They seek
stability, not moral satisfaction. Eagleburger recently declared that
"until we know at least with some confidence that we must act now
[against Iraq], then I say we need to be very careful about going
forward." Scowcroft, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, warned
that going after Hussein risks toppling friendly Middle East regimes
like Saudi Arabia. Nebraska GOP Sen. Charles Hagel, who served in
Vietnam, said that the war hawks "come at it from an intellectual
perspective versus having sat in jungles or foxholes." And Patrick J.
Buchanan, the truest representative of old-line Republican
isolationism, declared in USA Today that the war "the neocons want,
with the United States and Israel fighting all of the radical Islamic
states, is the war [Osama] bin Laden wants, the war his murderers
hoped to ignite when they sent those airliners into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   The alarms coming from within his own party have not changed
Bush's mind. He has basically given Israel carte blanche in its war
against Palestinian terror. Vice President Dick Cheney could not have
been more emphatic in his speech Monday before the Veterans of
Foreign Wars about the need for intervention in Iraq sooner rather
than later. While Powell maneuvers to stave off war, it is the
neocons who have Bush's ear. It's a stunning turnabout for an
intellectual movement that seemed a spent force after it helped bring
down the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   With the neocons urging him on, Bush isn't trying to redeem his
father. He's trying to win one for the Gipper.</TE>

<AU>KYLE LONGLEY</AU>
<BD>Kyle Longley, an associate professor of history at
Arizona State University, is the author of the forthcoming "Letting
the Glory Out: A Biography of Senator Albert Gore Sr."</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Some Democrats and political commentators have recently chastised
former Vice President Al Gore for emphasizing populist themes during
his unsuccessful 2000 presidential campaign. A few even denounced him
as a fake populist because he is the son of a U.S. senator, attended
private schools and enjoyed easy access to power. But Gore is no
fake. Indeed, populism runs in his veins.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everything about his late father, Albert Gore Sr.,
reflected populist-progressive roots. Born into a farming family in
1907, he attended a one-room schoolhouse and worked his way through
Middle Tennessee State Teachers College and the Nashville YMCA law
school. When elected to Congress in 1938, he vowed never to forget
his modest roots.</LD>
<LD>   The populist movement shaped the elder Gore from the beginning.
"As one who believes there is much merit in this Populist heritage,"
he once recalled, "it always seemed to me perfectly logical that
government should play an active role in the nation's business
affairs, and I have never lost faith in the government's ability to
guarantee economic justice to all people."</LD>
<TE>   Gore's populist-progressive impulses became increasingly evident
during his service in the House of Representatives. In 1946,
Republicans pushed a 20% across-the-board tax cut. Gore sarcastically
praised them for rising "to the defense of the forgotten man--all
those ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed Americans earning more than
$302,896 per year."</TE>
<TE>   With his tax savings, Gore noted, the wealthy man "will have
enough left to buy a yacht, I mean another yacht ... pay membership
in his golf club, take a cruise, a vacation, and still have $5,000
left with which to gamble in the stock market." In contrast, Gore
said, the man earning $1,200 a year would receive an increase of
$11.40, allowing him "to buy a cheap spring hat for his wife."</TE>
<TE>   When Gore entered the U.S. Senate in 1953, he cemented his
populist-progressive credentials. He fought to close tax loopholes
and supported campaign finance reform. He vehemently denounced the
GOP's pro-business policies, once telling a Michigan audience that
"if the Republican Party was ever reincarnated into a homing pigeon,
no matter from where it was released in the universe, whether from a
jet plane or in outer space, it would go directly home to Wall Street
without a flutter of the wing."</TE>
<TE>   Even when his party controlled Congress and the White House in the
1960s, Gore aggravated his fellow Democrats with his stances. He
vigorously criticized presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.
Johnson for cutting taxes for the wealthy to stimulate the economy.
Writing to Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield in 1962, he
complained that "a Democratic administration would seek to attack the
graduated income tax by drastically lowering the top brackets and
making the graduations less steep is unthinkable."</TE>
<TE>   Such maverick actions led one observer to characterize Gore as "a
senator who has deeply offended, at one time or another, nearly every
lobby and special interest on Capitol Hill.... He'll rock almost
anybody's boat." Eventually, his strong support of civil rights and
determined opposition to the Vietnam War and President Nixon's
Supreme Court nominees, coupled with his outspokenness, fed a
conservative backlash that led to his defeat in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent contradictions of Gore's decision to join
Occidental Petroleum in 1972, he never betrayed his political ideas.
In many ways, he worked hard to pass them along to his son. Each
summer, the young Gore returned home to work on the family farm,
where the senator assigned him especially arduous tasks--clearing
brush was a favorite--in addition to his daily chores. It was part of
a concerted effort to make sure that junior understood the value of
manual labor and empathized with the millions who relied on it for
their livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   The senator also tutored his son politically. A childhood friend
of the former vice president recalled that Al Sr. explained the
issues of the day in excruciating detail to his son, promoting his
populist viewpoint throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after son Al Gore entered the House of Representatives in
1977, he bore the markings of his father. He challenged businesses on
consumer and environmental issues, including an Occidental Petroleum
subsidiary in charge of Love Canal. When reporters asked the elder
Gore about his son's criticism, he said: "There are some people at
Occidental who wish I didn't have a son. But I think my son has been
right in most instances. Sure, he steps on our toes every now and
then, but we have a lot of toes and perhaps they should be stepped
on."</TE>
<TE>   The son's politics resembled the father's in other ways. In the
early 1990s, he proposed the Working Family Tax Relief Act, which
would have cut the taxes of more than 30 million workers by levying
an 11% surtax on incomes exceeding $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   He also took on powerful vested interests in his book "Earth in
the Balance," among them the petroleum and automobile industries, for
their role in the production of greenhouse gases. He prodded
President Clinton to endorse the Kyoto Protocol--the U.S. still
hasn't endorsed this effort to cut greenhouse gases--and earned
considerable conservative antipathy as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Al Gore's embrace of populism during his presidential campaign,
then, was anything but opportunistic. Rather, it was all in the
family.</TE>

<HD>An Achilles Heel</HD>
<DH>The GOP used crime in the streets to reclaim political
power. Democrats hope crime in the suites will do the same for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Phillips is the author of "Wealth and Democracy:
A Political History of the American Rich."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 30 years ago, crime in the streets became the symbolic
linchpin of a powerful new conservative agenda that realigned U.S.
politics around thematic caricatures ranging from hippies and
pointy-headed professors to welfare Cadillacs and Willie Horton.
Today's liberals hope that crime in the suites can be just as
effective and enduring.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe. But probably not in time for the midterm elections in
November. A few John Rigases or Martha Stewarts won't mobilize the
U.S. electorate. Deeper worries must bubble, and they're not likely
to shape political debate until the presidential election two years
from now.</LD>
<LD>   Crime rarely becomes a dominant national political issue by
itself. It usually takes on a high profile when connected to a
broader governmental incapacity. In the 1960s and early '70s, amid
central-city and campus riots and the morass of Vietnam, crime in the
streets became Richard M. Nixon's catchword for a failure of liberal
politics, jurisprudence and sociology, as well as excessive belief in
the power of government to do good. That deeper worry was the motor
that made crime statistics a cutting-edge indicator: the public's
fear of deadly streets, revolutionary campuses, police crippled by
liberal judges, ruined neighborhoods, endangered homes.</LD>
<TE>   This year, politics is still looking for its conceptual motor. For
crime in the corporate suites to become one, it too must come to
symbolize a broader failure, most likely of conservative economic
policy.</TE>
<TE>   For many Americans, the failures three decades ago were embodied
by student demonstrators, draft evaders, social planners and
central-city looters. Realignment-class politics usually requires
this kind of gross oversimplification, and any comparable 2002-04
provocation must produce a new set of targets. Philosophers need not
apply. Devils would have to be made out of the constituencies and
theorists of organized greed, experimental deregulation, financial
finagling and corporations uber alles.</TE>
<TE>   You can already see who might make the list: crooked CEOs,
gimlet-eyed investment bankers, politicians paid off by the likes of
Enron--as well as unethical accountants, shady Wall Street securities
analysts, pension-fund skimmers and so on. But it will take two or
three more years of high-profile scandal to really ring true.</TE>
<TE>   In place of the sociology, war and urban breakdowns of 30-plus
years ago, the most plausible 2002-04 inflammations could be mutual
fund evaporations, a popped housing bubble, more stock collapses and
beggared pension funds. Top economic officials say that it can't
happen and that the economy is doing well. That is part of the
question.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier gestation of crime as a national political issue
didn't happen overnight. Moreover, it was interrupted by an external
surprise--Watergate--that for a while seemed to turn the tables as to
who stood for law and order and who didn't. New terrorist strikes
could similarly scramble issues in 2002-04.</TE>
<TE>   A renewal of such attacks could affect the crime-in-the-suites
issue in at least two ways. It could create a garrison-state America,
in which the public's multiplying fears and anxieties would dwarf
worries about executive-suite corruption. But it could also turn the
country toward previous, more strict wartime societal attitudes that
frowned on black-market behavior and slapped heavy taxes on excess
profits during wartime. That kind of "patriotic puritan" America
could be extremely hard on the sort of behavior that has been in the
news recently.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, terrorism remains in abeyance, allowing
Americans to refocus on economic problems that antedated the Sept. 11
attacks. Here the executive-crime issue is important not just as a
symbol but also as a barometer--a measurement of how many sectors of
the economy have been put at risk by corruption, speculation and
greed.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet craze that led to the high-tech bubble and the
misbehavior by technology and investment firms associated with it,
while expensive to investors, seems like old history. This is lucky
for Republicans because nobody is likely to blame them for what went
wrong in an industry full of pony-tailed executives and companies
with names like Yahoo, Gadzooks and Ask Jeeves.</TE>
<TE>   The next two major industries to self-destruct in the stock and
bond markets--telecommunications and energy merchants--suggest more
traditional foul play. State and federal deregulation was one factor,
political influence-buying another and criminal greed a third.</TE>
<TE>   Here, crime in the suites has produced a cast of obvious criminal
personifications--notably, Enron and WorldCom--and a clear
ideological bias. Conservative touchstones--overenthusiastic
deregulation, permissive corporate governance and a penchant for
worshiping markets the way 1960s liberalism knelt at the altar of
sociology--have been implicated.</TE>
<TE>   The next and even larger industry charged with both negligence and
criminality is the investment business, and finance has been a
bugaboo, almost always at conservative expense, for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who forced Merrill Lynch to
make a $100-million settlement for the improper activities of its
securities analysts, has now turned his attention to Citigroup and
its investment subsidiary, Salomon Smith Barney. He's reportedly
investigating whether Citigroup CEO Sanford Weill urged Salomon Smith
Barney securities analyst Jack Grubman to issue a bullish report on
AT&amp;T stock in order to land investment-banking business with the
telecom company. If true, that would be of great interest to
financial reporters who remember the recently repealed Glass-Steagall
Act--but a yawner in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   John and Jane Q. Public, however, could wind up reaching for worry
beads if scandal significantly threatens the value of their pension
funds, mutual funds and homes. Collapses in the technology, telecom
and energy sectors have already played havoc with some household
assets. The fear is that more damaging disclosures may be coming.</TE>
<TE>   The housing bubble has been talked about incessantly. The danger
is that Americans have refinanced their houses and refinanced again,
spending their equity to stay afloat. That's OK if your $300,000 home
has only $245,000 borrowed against it. But if the bubble pops, your
suburban castle could become a $225,000 house with $245,000 borrowed
against it. This is when palms begin to sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Financial nest eggs have been shrinking, and now the uncertainty
is spreading to funds. Mutual funds, to begin with, have had two bad
years and now face a third in 2002. Some may be endangered by
redemptions; others may simply be shut down and merged into other
funds at other companies.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with pension funds is more complex because there are
several varieties of them. But to make a long story short, many large
companies with defined-benefit programs used price gains in their
funds' stock holdings to inflate their profits. What's all too clear
is that they now need to fill the gap by making huge payments to the
pension funds. How much of that gap will actually be closed over the
next two to three years can be thought of as Sweaty Palms II.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these regulatory gaps and excessive deregulations tap a
conservative and Republican set of weaknesses--how many financial
villains in old movies were liberals?--and the overall retirement
issue is one of their most sensitive. The Bush administration's
proposal to privatize portions of Social Security through individual
investments is morphing into the biggest boomerang this side of
Australia, drawing rebukes from dozens of GOP congressional
contenders.</TE>
<TE>   In short, crime in the suites, if it is to cut deeply as an issue,
must get its motor from the broader set of economic loyalties and
fallacies that underpin conservative ideological failure and
permissiveness. This is why the fact that lots of liberal and
Democratic politicians have also taken--no, courted--business and
financial money may not be too significant. What will be decisive is
whether the full complex of issues develops and the Democratic Party
can lay it out and apply the branding iron.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-odd years ago, part of the reason why voters turned away
from liberals and Democrats was that if the problems these
officeholders had nurtured were still festering, and if their
interest groups were the ones still acting up, was it smart to have
them in power? Was it smart to expect liberals to do a good job
running welfare, courtrooms, wars or budgets?</TE>
<TE>   Now the worm may have turned, although it's likely to be 2004
before we can tell. If mutual fund performance remains shaky,
pensioners watch Spam prices, permissive economic regulation is still
an issue and indicted chief financial officers still smirk in their
Bel-Air and Boca Raton mansions, conservatives and Republicans may
have their own problem. A big problem.</TE>

<AU>MICHAEL A. REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>Michael A. Reynolds is a fellow at Harvard University's
John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies, where he works on Near
Eastern history and politics.</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>A new battle in the war on terror is about to begin. Its theater is
currently off Washington's radar screen. Its time and place are not
America's to choose. Its weapons are not military aid or bullets. On
Nov. 3, Turkey goes to the polls--and, in the impending battle of
speeches and ballots, more hangs in the balance than Washington seems
to know.</LD>
<LD>   Since Turkey's fiscal and stock-market meltdowns of spring 2001,
international attention has focused on the country's dire economic
situation. Its subsequent political meltdown has captured little
attention. Rickety by nature, a coalition of the far-right
Nationalist Action Party and the center-left Democratic Left Party
collapsed this summer after Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and World
Bank-tested financial guru Kemal Dervis quit the Cabinet and the
party of the physically ailing prime minister, Bulent Ecevit.</LD>
<LD>   Though it shocked outsiders, including the International Monetary
Fund, Turks know the failure of Ecevit's coalition was no fluke. His
party is only the latest of the establishment parties to implode over
the past 10 years as a restless Turkish society grows increasingly
disenchanted with its existing political options. The summer crisis
of 2002 signals how desperate Turks are for change.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest beneficiary of change will almost certainly be
Turkey's newest Islamist party, the Justice and Development Party,
better known by its Turkish initials as the AK Party. Led by the
charismatic former mayor of Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party
has, as even Turkey's staunchly secular media establishment
reluctantly concedes, an excellent--even probable--chance to become
Turkey's No. 1 party this November.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for AK's astounding popularity are easy to find, and
they have little connection to religious fervor. Founded just a year
ago, the AK Party enjoys the important advantage of having an
unsullied reputation. Erdogan's record as an honest and effective
mayor of one of the world's largest cities impresses an electorate
disgusted by corruption and scandal. That he was jailed in 1999 for
publicly reciting a well-known religious poem, labeled by the state
as reactionary propaganda, enables him to run as someone outside an
establishment increasingly blamed for mismanaging Turkey's abundant
resources and its dynamic and capable population.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Turkey's other Islamist party, the Saadet or Felicity
Party, from which it split, the AK Party places little faith in Islam
as a political solution for Turkey's woes. Instead, its platform
emphasizes the need to facilitate the growth of Turkey's democratic
civil society and better protect human and cultural rights.
Economically, the platform calls for greater foreign investment in
Turkey and a reduction in the obstacles to free enterprise. Erdogan
wants closer relations with both Europe and the United States. With
the latter, he seeks to move beyond military ties to more investment
and cooperation in trade, technology and education.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds suspiciously like a program designed by yuppies,
that's because it is. An important segment of the AK leadership and
constituency consists of the new class of businessmen and
entrepreneurs from Anatolia that began in the 1980s to challenge
Turkey's ruling business and political elites in Istanbul and Ankara.
Their Islamic identity is both cause and effect of their frustration
with the rigidly secular Turkish establishment, a frustration they
share with the vast majority of Turkish citizens.</TE>
<TE>   While the leaders and members of the AK Party do not flaunt their
Muslim heritage, they do not hide it, either. And therein lies the
importance of the party and Turkey's upcoming elections to the war on
terror.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has, correctly, striven to make clear that
the struggle with international terrorism is not a struggle with
Islam. Many observers believe Turkey is an example of a successful
Muslim democracy, one worthy of emulation elsewhere in the Muslim
world. However, boosters of the "Turkish model" overlook a crucial
fact: Muslims outside Turkey often regard its rigid controls on
religious expression as both inimical to Islam and undemocratic.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Islam can, in fact, be compatible with liberal democracy
is one of the most urgent and important questions facing the world
today. If liberal democracy is not an option for the Muslim world,
the West will face a future of endless and escalating conflict with a
resentful billion human beings, the clash of civilizations that
Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington has warned about.</TE>
<TE>   But if liberal democracy can be shown to be compatible with Islam,
such a clash can be averted. The world will have no laboratory more
favorable to a successful outcome than Turkey, with its extensive
experience with democracy and its heritage of an Islam historically
far richer and more tolerant than that of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
Arab states. And, given the central role Turkey has played in Islamic
history as the seat of the caliph and the heart of the Ottoman
Empire, Turkey's success in showcasing liberal Islamic politics in a
vibrant democracy would not escape the notice of the wider Muslim
world.</TE>
<TE>   Some within Turkey remain suspicious of AK's claim to be a Muslim
equivalent of Western Europe's centrist Christian Democrats. Some
even seek to ban the new party. If intransigent elites prevail on
this, the world may never know whether Muslims can attain a truly
democratic politics. It makes sense to let AK have a chance.</TE>

<LD>Work keeps at bay three great evils: boredom, vice and need.</LD>
<LD>   --Voltaire</LD>
<LD>   It's all in the day's work, as the huntsman said when the lion ate
him.</LD>
<TE>   --Charles Kingsley</TE>
<TE>   Work is a necessity for man. Man invented the alarm clock.</TE>
<TE>   -- Pablo Picasso</TE>
<TE>   A rat race is for rats.</TE>
<TE>   --Jimmy Reid</TE>
<TE>   The first "workingman's holiday" was celebrated in America 120
years ago. A parade in New York City drew 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   This was a tumultuous time in the land.</TE>
<TE>   For those who pine for the good old days, reading the history of
that era will sober you up. In the years between 1877 and 1887,
upstanding civic leaders joined forces with the Louisiana militia and
shot down 35 unarmed sugar workers who were striking for $1 a day in
wages. Federal troops and militia killed 30 railroad workers and
wounded 100 more in a strike over a 10% pay cut. A bomb killed seven
policemen at Chicago's Haymarket Square during a labor rally in favor
of the eight-hour workday. Seeking the same, workers in Milwaukee
were set upon by state militia, who killed seven. Ten coal-mining
reformers were hanged.</TE>
<TE>   So we can feast off the barbecue this Labor Day with a sense of
relief: At least we aren't slaughtering each other.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't a holiday for champagne toasts either. Corporate
scandals and outrageous personal greed by business elites grabbed the
economic headlines this year, and deservedly so. Unfortunately,
though, these misdeeds diverted our attention from the discouraging,
even scary, trends that have reversed years of progress for everyday
working Americans.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, we're working too hard. The eight-hour workday for
which activists died a century ago has once again slipped out of our
grasp. The promise of "labor-saving devices" turned out to be the Big
Lie of our age. In most fields of employment, the average workweek
exceeds 40 hours. The average number of weeks worked has also
lengthened. This extra work, not higher wages, chiefly accounts for
increased household earnings since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush calls us "the hardest-working people in the
world," he means it as a boast. But nearly 40% of us feel overworked
at the expense of family life and personal health. We take fewer
vacations and put in more hours than people in any other
industrialized country, and this doesn't count the new
round-the-clock "on call" policies that many companies have imposed
by way of beepers, cell phones and laptop computers.</TE>
<TE>   For these figures, I thank the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute
for its book-length report, "The State of Working America 2002-03,"
published this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   If we are overworked, we are also overspent. Household debt grew
much more rapidly than household income in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, family debt exceeded expendable income by 10% on the
average. Almost one family in 10 is overdue by 60 days on its bills.
Personal bankruptcies reached an all-time high last year.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of Americans are less prepared for retirement
now than before the so-called boom of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a generation ago, we are less likely to receive
fringe benefits on the job today.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer of our employers offer health insurance. Retirement programs
have shrunk. The number of paid holidays has declined. Job stability
is on the retreat. The minimum wage has lost almost 30% of its
purchasing power.</TE>
<TE>   Honestly, you have to wonder. If we ever had time to catch our
breath, wouldn't we be asking, just what are we doing anyway? And
why?</TE>
<TE>   But we cannot afford to ask the questions, and we know it.</TE>
<TE>   We may gnash our teeth when we learn how industrial moguls
fantastically enrich themselves at the expense of those who do the
honest work, but we also understand that almost all of us, top to
bottom, are propelled nervously into the future by those twin slave
drivers, consumer confidence and workplace efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Insofar as I can tell, this is the sole economic theory we have on
which to hang our sweat-soaked hats: Each of us must increase our
spending for goods and services and simultaneously work harder to
produce them faster. We don't hear much about where we'll eventually
wind up with this strategy, although we might guess. If we dared.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, we know that after Labor Day comes more labor. The
freeways once again choke up with commuters, the kids head back to
school, pack up the aloha shirts.</TE>
<TE>   As Roman playwright Titus Plautus observed about 2,200 years ago:
"He that eats the nut must crack the shell."</TE>

<HD>Bigger Is Better for the Future of NATO</HD>
<DH>The alliance should accept Bulgaria, Romania and five other
nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At its summit in late November in Prague, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will continue its enlargement into Central and Eastern
Europe, which began in 1998 when it admitted Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic. Five aspirant countries seem almost certain to
receive invitations--Slovenia, Slovakia and the Baltic nations
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The only real suspense is whether to
also include Romania and Bulgaria.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, I shared the skepticism about admitting such a large
group. I now believe that NATO should extend invitations to all seven
countries.</LD>
<LD>   What changed my mind are the attacks of Sept. 11, the Romanian and
Bulgarian governments' vigorous responses to them and the increasing
strategic importance of both countries to the war against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   As Operation Enduring Freedom against Al Qaeda unfolded, the two
southern Balkan neighbors volunteered important assistance. They
shared intelligence data with the United States and opened their
skies for American supply flights to Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria allowed the temporary basing of U.S. military personnel
and equipment on its territory, and Romania sent a combat unit, the
"Red Scorpions,'' to Afghanistan. Indeed, the Romanians flew their
troops there in their own C-130 Hercules aircraft, a feat that at
least one major Western European ally was unable to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Both countries have contributed troops to the international
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, as they have done in Bosnia and
Kosovo. While sending their troops abroad, Bucharest and Sofia are
successfully carrying out comprehensive and difficult NATO-mandated
reforms at home to downsize, professionalize and modernize their
militaries.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from continuing to make tangible additions to alliance
security, Romania and Bulgaria as members of NATO could help to
bridge a "strategic mentality gap" emerging in the alliance. Having
only recently cast off the oppressive communist tyranny that stifled
them for decades, both countries seem more aware of threats to their
freedom than are most Western Europeans, and therefore are more
willing to take the fight to terrorists outside Europe if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Romania and Bulgaria stagnated under ineffectual governments for
much of the 1990s, but after peaceful transfers of power they now
have embarked upon privatization of their economies and reform of
their communist-era judicial and police systems.</TE>
<TE>   They are also coming to terms with the darker sides of their
recent histories. Bulgaria's ethnic Turks, the victims of a primitive
campaign of Bulgarianization and expulsion in the last spasms of a
totally bankrupt communist regime in the mid-1980s, now form an
influential component of the ruling governmental coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria's refusal to surrender any of its Jewish citizens to the
Nazis was the shining example of moral courage in World War II. The
Jewish community continues to be a respected element of Bulgarian
society and currently numbers the country's foreign minister in its
ranks. Attempting to overcome an ancient enmity, Romania's ruling
party concluded a cooperation agreement with the parliamentary
representatives of the Hungarian minority after last fall's
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Bucharest is also facing up to the grisly role its own fascists
played in the Holocaust, and relations with the surviving Jewish
community are excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this laudable progress, Bulgaria and Romania remain poor
countries afflicted with organized crime and widespread corruption,
which tough, new anti-crime programs are striving to remedy. Like
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, both have yet to find ways to integrate
their large, vilified Roma populations into mainstream society.</TE>
<TE>   In Romania, up to one-fifth of the electorate is stubbornly
susceptible to the simplistic propaganda of the ultra-nationalist
Greater Romania Party, now led by an unstable demagogue. Nonetheless,
democracy in Romania and Bulgaria has already been able to set down
deep roots. The media are fiercely independent, if often
sensationalist, and civil society is playing an increasingly active
role in public life.</TE>
<TE>   NATO membership would create a classic "win-win" situation:
Bulgaria and Romania would enhance the power of the alliance in the
new post-Sept. 11 international security environment, while their
inclusion in the most important Euro-Atlantic institution would
strengthen the progressive forces in each country. Of course, both of
these countries must prove to the U.S. Senate that they are committed
fully to being worthy members of the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, I had the honor to be in charge on the Senate floor of
the ratification of the most recent round of NATO enlargement.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, I hope the Senate will be able to consider the addition
to the alliance of seven more countries, including Bulgaria and
Romania.</TE>

<LD>There are two great divisions in American religion.</LD>
<LD>   The first is between progressives and orthodox, in which there are
greater similarities among Jews, Protestants and Catholics who are
liberal or conservative than there are similarities within the ranks
of any one of these major religious traditions, each of which is
fractured by polarization. For example, as a liberal Protestant, I
have more in common with a progressive Jew or Catholic than I do with
a fundamentalist Christian.</LD>
<LD>   The other great divide is between Americans who embrace
spirituality but deny the validity of religion and those who accept
religion.</LD>
<TE>   Religion, in the popular mind, is associated with institutions,
wooden rituals and archaic tradition, whereas spirituality is
identified with an individual's quest for connection with a higher
power. These two sets of distinctions are useful in putting Los
Angeles' new cathedral in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The critics of the cathedral complain that too much money was
spent on bricks and mortar--actually alabaster and concrete--and that
this money could have been better invested in serving the homeless or
addressing global issues of social justice.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is a tempting argument, it falls prey both to
extremist versions of progressivism and a radical emphasis on
individual spirituality. Clearly, religion is wooden and even
idolatrous if it ignores the poor and disenfranchised while it
pursues ritualistic practice within opulent physical structures. The
Hebrew prophets had some very nasty things to say about this form of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet spirituality and social justice activities are sustained over
the long term when they are integrally tied to a worshipping
community that has deep roots within a religious tradition, and this
means that a certain degree of institutional form is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   While I am something of a mystic and believe deeply in the value
of individual spirituality, I also affirm the importance of locating
one's individual quest within a framework of institutional practice
and interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Without this point of reference, spiritual pursuits run the risk
of being trite, self-indulgent and even narcissistic.</TE>
<TE>   It is for this reason that I celebrate the opening this week of
the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. In a city known for crystal
gazers, hip meditation practices and other exotic and trendy
expressions of spirituality, it is appropriate to balance the scale
by affirming the role of religion in its institutional form.</TE>
<TE>   One would never want to lose the voice of the prophet in
critiquing religion that lives for itself--perfecting ritual form at
the expense of connecting individuals with the spirit of God. This
polarity between religion and spirituality is false. Likewise,
progressives who emphasize social action and ignore the heritage of
their tradition are at risk of producing short-run efforts in social
transformation that lack the staying power of a worshipping community
that draws on the resources of an established institution.</TE>

<HD>Standardized Testing Is Failing Our Students</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am eyeing with confusion four separate tests that my third-grade
stepson took this last school year. The Stanford 9 test indicates
that he is far below basic in math and at grade level in reading. The
California state achievement test indicates he is far below basic in
reading and at grade level in math. He was tested one-on-one at the
Sylvan Learning Center, where he was being tutored, and again
one-on-one by the school district psychologist to see if he qualified
for special education services. Both of the individually administered
tests indicate that he is right at grade level.</LD>
<LD>   What am I to garner from these results? I know he is not the most
motivated of learners, and I believe he didn't put forth his best
efforts on the standardized tests, but when an actual person was
asking the questions he did try. The standardized tests not only
don't reflect his true skills (as well as many other students'), they
drag down the overall scores of his school and make his teacher look
like she didn't do her job well (which I can assure you she did).
They are a complete waste of our tax money and deprive our children
of two weeks of school days that would be better used for
instruction, not worthless testing.</LD>
<TE>   I am a former teacher, and I and anyone else who has ever taught
can affirm that standardized tests are a sham foisted upon schools by
politicians seeking to further their own agendas.</TE>

<LD>"Calabasas Wants Stars in Its Skies" (Aug. 26) brings up an important
issue dear to all those who enjoy the night sky. There is, however,
one important point that was not mentioned. Misdirected lighting
wastes an estimated $1 billion worth of energy annually in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Culver City, I can only count about seven stars from my
light-drenched street. The city recently installed so many new street
lamps that you almost have to wear sunglasses. The glare from the
lamps actually makes it harder to see. Half the light from these
lamps goes straight up. What a waste. If all the other reasons
against light pollution aren't good enough, look at the bottom line.</LD>

<AU>KATHERINE ELLISON</AU>
<BD>Katherine Ellison is a consulting writer with Stanford
University's Center for Conservation Biology and co-author of "The
New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable."</BD>
<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, inspired by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, four
dozen of the world's major CEOs offered a vision of the future that
today seems downright radical.</LD>
<LD>   The group, founders of the Business Council for Sustainable
Development, included several U.S. notables, such as Alcoa's Paul H.
O'Neill (now Treasury secretary), DuPont Co.'s Edgar Woolard and
Johnson Wax's Samuel Johnson. They endorsed some surprisingly
controversial measures: an energy tax, an end to subsidies for coal
and electricity and a new system of pricing goods and services to
reflect their toll on nature. "Environmental thinking is bringing a
new industrial revolution," vowed the group's leader, Swiss magnate
Stephan Schmidheiny.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, that summer of 1992 already had an aura of green hope.
Voters were preparing to oust then-President Bush in favor of Bill
Clinton. Al Gore's crusading book, "Earth in the Balance," was headed
for the bestseller list. Public pressure was mounting for government
and corporate leaders to take action on global warming, tropical
deforestation and the dizzying rate of plant and animal extinctions.
Both Bush--who had said he would be the "environmental
president"--and Clinton were reportedly studying whether to back a
revolutionary tax on consumption.</LD>
<TE>   Now, as global leaders take up these issues once more at another
world summit, in Johannesburg, South Africa, our planetary plight is
more alarming than ever. The corporate effort endorsed 10 years ago
has had some successes, but on a scale too small to be significant.
At the same time, the scientific consensus has solidified that our
climate is changing in perilous ways and that humans are largely
responsible. Yet in contrast to 1992, our expectations of corporate
behavior are so low that we're pleased when firms promise to list
their stock options as expenses--never mind trying to help save the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame? Or, as we may well be asking ourselves in 10 more
years, who lost Earth? It's all too obvious. Despite stirring
rhetoric and even some admirable actions by a few innovative firms,
it has always been up to governments to make sure there's a "business
case" for corporations to start treading more lightly on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   To date, governments have failed to provide concrete incentives
for businesses to, for example, switch from polluting fossil fuels to
renewable energy sources. (The Bush administration opposes this
strategy: At the summit, the U.S., joining Saudi Arabia and other
industrialized and oil-producing states, rejected a plan calling for
the use of renewable energy technologies to be increased to account
for 15% of the world's total energy production by 2010.) On the
whole, it seems there's a huge and growing disconnect between the
scale of our environmental problems and official willingness to act.</TE>
<TE>   If this weren't so clear today it would be easy, as it has long
been, to target multinational corporations, with their relentless
search for profits, their budgets dwarfing those of many nations and
their habitual resistance to new laws. Back in 1992, Greenpeace
International branded the new business council's call for reform "a
veiled attempt to minimize international environmental controls."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the group, now called the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development, has never hidden its preference for free
markets and volunteer measures. Even so, it marked its birth with the
big, surprising step of recognizing that consumption is the crux of
our environmental problem--and that, somehow, prices must start to
reflect the worth of Earth. The message was: Until it's no longer
profitable to squander resources, the squandering will obviously
continue. But the firms never claimed to have the power to change the
rules; they were explicitly asking for new policies.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, in the last 10 years, several big U.S. firms have
achieved impressive progress in their voluntary quests to be
"sustainable." DuPont has made huge investments in reducing emissions
of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, that cause global warming,
and it claims to have saved money in the process. Alcoa has invented
technology that substantially reduces the energy required to make
aluminum. Some energy utility officials have even been lobbying
Congress and the Bush administration to limit carbon dioxide
emissions. They're guessing that such a limit is inevitable and don't
want to invest in technologies that will have to be abandoned if new
laws are passed.</TE>
<TE>   These kinds of bottom-line considerations underlie most of the
accomplishments to date in what remains a minority pursuit. But some
CEOs are also starting to feel heat from green-minded stockholders,
employees and consumers. And some, looking further into the future,
are convinced tomorrow's most successful firms will be the most
"eco-efficient," using fewer resources and producing less waste.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians have more trouble thinking past four-year cycles. Bill
"Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" Clinton showed this by
abandoning his promise to tax energy--and by offering to open the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas prices low during the 1996
election. Al "Earth in the Balance" Gore suggested similar lack of
resolve when he played down environmental issues in his 2000
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even the most farsighted firms feel shareholder pressure to
produce good quarterly reports. It's government's responsibility, in
the short term--and the time to act is shorter every day--to make
sure those reports are judged by a new "triple bottom line" of
financial, environmental and social performance.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the best of the companies, the 25 that are doing
the best things [environmentally], they're providing new
leadership--but even for them, in an absence of policy, they can be
undercut by competitors," World Resources Institute President
Jonathan Lash says. "The most basic question is: When is our
government going to limit greenhouse gas emissions? If companies knew
they'd face such a limit in 10 years, they'd be making a lot more
investments in technology now that would be helping the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, corporations are clamoring to prove their green
credentials by joining groups with other self-styled idealists (the
sustainable development council now has more than 150 members) and
signing on to any one or more of an array of new-age accounting
schemes, such as the Global Reporting Initiative, designed to measure
sustainability.</TE>
<TE>   All these measures remain purely voluntary, however, leaving
bewildered lay folk stuck with trying to decide which new standards
and affiliations mean anything.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the Johannesburg meeting drones on, about 30 million
acres of tropical forests--an area the size of Pennsylvania--are
vanishing each year. We're taking fish out of the sea faster than
they can reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   Two billion people now suffer from inadequate access to clean
water--and the United Nations says that number will grow to 5 billion
in the next two decades. And 2002 may be recorded as the hottest year
since records have been kept. "We have hardly begun the task of
creating a more sustainable society," the most recent sustainable
development council report acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, business council leader Schmidheiny said businesses
willing to act instead of resisting change might build support for
self-regulation, "provided we do it in time, we do it convincingly
and in a transparent way. If we fail to do it in time, we face
government regulations under pressure from the public."</TE>
<TE>   The time has passed. What must change now is not just a few
players but the whole playing field. Which means voters must insist
that government step up to the plate.</TE>

<LD>Question: I own a four-plex in Long Beach that is rundown. I want to
rehabilitate the units one at a time to raise the value of the
property. Can I give the tenants 30-day notices to move? Do I need to
give them the reasons why I am fixing up the building?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Under California law, you are required to give the tenants
30-day written notices to move but you don't have to specify the
reasons. There is a proposal pending in Sacramento (SB 1403) authored
by state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles) to change the state's
30-day notice requirement to 60 days, which is the current
requirement under a pilot project in effect in L.A., Santa Monica and
West Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   All of Los Angeles Is Covered by Rent Control</LD>
<TE>   Q: I am considering buying a three-to four-unit apartment building
in the Los Angeles area, preferably in the 90008, 90016, 90019 or
90056 ZIP Code areas. Are any of these areas covered by rent control?</TE>
<TE>   A: All of these areas are covered by rent control. All ZIP Codes
that start out with 900 are located in the city of Los Angeles in
addition to several other ZIP Codes. For instance, Venice, 90291; and
Pacific Palisades, 90272; also are parts of Los Angeles, as is North
Hollywood, 91608.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities in Los Angeles County that have municipal
rent-control laws include Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and West
Hollywood. Although these cities all have rent control, there are a
variety of exemptions from the laws in the different cities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Santa Monica duplexes and triplexes are exempt. In
Los Angeles, new construction is exempt. For other exemptions, check
with each city individually.</TE>
<TE>   Expect Hikes Until Rent Catches Up to the Market</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in a rent-controlled apartment in Los Angeles. Since I
moved in when rents were relatively low, the landlord always raises
my rent by the maximum allowable 3%. Newer tenants receive no such
rent increases, presumably because they already are paying close to
the market rents. Is it legal for the landlord to raise the rents on
some apartments but not on others?</TE>
<TE>   A: It is legal for the landlord to raise rents on some apartments
and not others, even under rent control.</TE>
<TE>   Rent control limits the maximum amounts of annual cost-of-living
rent increases (3% under Los Angeles rent control).</TE>
<TE>   It does not require owners to raise rents by 3%, or by any other
amount, and it does not require owners to raise all rents equally or
at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   If your apartment rent is significantly lower than the market
rents on similar apartments, you probably can expect to continue
getting those annual 3% rent increase notices until your rent catches
up with the market.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Agency Handles Rent-Control Queries</TE>
<TE>   Q: My grandmother died recently, and now I find myself 20% owner
of a rent-controlled apartment building in Playa del Rey. My cousins
and I (the new owners) live in three different states, and we have
numerous questions about rent control. Where can we go for
rent-control information?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can get information about the Los Angeles rent-control law
from the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Division of the Los Angeles
Housing Department. Reaching them by phone at (213) 367-9269 can be
difficult. You also can visit or write to LARSD at 111 N. Hope St.,
Los Angeles 90012.</TE>
<TE>   How Secession Would Affect Rent Control</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Woodland Hills
for the last 31 years. Since the talk of splitting up the San
Fernando Valley from the city of Los Angeles, the owners are not
renewing any leases, which we have always had.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are putting everybody on month-to-month rental
agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a sign that rent control isn't going to be in effect any
more?</TE>
<TE>   A: If there is a new Valley city, all of the laws from Los Angeles
will initially carry over and remain in effect in the new city,
including rent control.</TE>
<TE>   The new city will elect its own city council and mayor, who
subsequently will determine whether or not they want to continue with
rent control in its present form, if at all.</TE>

<HD>Housing Market 'Still Going Up'</HD>
<DH>Sales* Despite rumors that it has peaked, California's
bullish streak is continuing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dispelling rapidly spreading rumors that the current real estate boom
is about to end, a study released Wednesday points to a continuing
bull housing market in most of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Even as some of the higher-priced areas of Orange, Ventura and Los
Angeles counties are taking a temporary breather from rapidly rising
home prices, most of Los Angeles, and particularly the Inland Empire,
continues to see a rise in home prices, said the study's author,
Christopher Cagan, director of research and analytics at First
American Real Estate Solutions, a nationwide provider of real estate
information.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the party's going on for a while," Cagan said. "The
market has not peaked."</LD>
<TE>   Amid continuing double-digit home price increases and sharp spikes
in home sales, questions have arisen about whether California real
estate is experiencing a "bubble" that is about to burst.</TE>
<TE>   Cagan pointed to several indicators that belie that assumption.</TE>
<TE>   First, the average yearly price appreciation for detached,
single-family homes over the last 16 years is up in all five
Southland counties. And prices, while exceeding pre-recession prices
in some areas, have not yet reached the levels of the late 1980s in
many areas, leaving room for even higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, although the number of those who can afford a
median-priced home has dropped in the last year into the 20% to 30%
range, that figure is nowhere near the affordability levels of about
13% to 18% of the late '80s, a benchmark for a housing recession,
Cagan said.</TE>
<TE>   Other bull-market predictors include the current low
mortgage-interest rates, stronger housing demand than supply, the
quick pace of sales once a home hits the market, and the slow pace of
new-home construction.</TE>
<TE>   Signs of a declining market would include falling prices,
increased foreclosures and forced government bailouts, none of which
is occurring.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing market can take a breather right now, especially in
Orange County, where there's been such a bull market for so long,"
Cagan said. "The overall market is still going up, and will for a
while."</TE>

<LD>This Little Holmby house was redesigned by Michael Maltzan, who spent
seven years working for Frank Gehry before opening his own office in
1995.</LD>
<LD>   In June, the temporary home of New York's Museum of Modern Art,
which was designed by Maltzan, was completed. The building in Queens
includes features such as a series of block letters on the roof that
slide into focus, forming the letters M-O-M-A. Maltzan also designed
the new Kidspace Museum in Pasadena and a renovation of the UCLA
Hammer Museum in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   About this home: The building is a major remodel of a house
constructed in 1954. The property has been owned for the last 2 1/2
years by developer Tony Nicholas, who rebuilt the house according to
Maltzan's design, with the intent of selling it. The house was
recently completed but hasn't yet been occupied. The design
represents Maltzan's interpretation of California living at its
finest.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $3,695,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: The 4,069-square-foot house has three bedrooms, maid's
quarters and a guest house. There are 5 1/2 bathrooms. The lot is
nearly an acre at 41,382 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The house has dramatic public rooms and a master suite
that overlooks a large lawn, a pool, a spa and a hill with trees.</TE>

<LD>Cybill Shepherd, who appeared earlier this year in the Showtime movie
"Due East" and is developing a musical play based on her life, has
listed her gated, mountaintop home in the San Fernando Valley at just
under $3.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The single actress, who has three children, is looking for smaller
quarters now that the younger ones are away at school.</LD>
<LD>   Shepherd, who starred in her own series "Cybill" on CBS-TV during
the '90s and co-starred earlier with Bruce Willis in the TV series
"Moonlighting," has lived in her Valley home for eight years. Built
in 1951, the house was virtually razed and rebuilt about 10 years
ago.</LD>
<TE>   The home, on about an acre, has five bedrooms plus maid's quarters
and 7 1/2 bathrooms in just under 7,000 square feet. The main house
has a master retreat with a steam shower, spa tub and two walk-in
closets. The kitchen has granite and stainless-steel built-ins. The
house also has an upstairs study with a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds have a large motor court and a soccer-sized play yard
as well as a guest house, tennis court, wine cellar, pool, spa and
canyon and valley views.</TE>
<TE>   Shepherd, 52, is also working on developing what she calls her
"unreality TV show," spurred on by the success of "The Osbournes" on
MTV and her autobiography "Cybill Disobedience: How I Survived Beauty
Pageants, Elvis, Sex, Bruce Willis, Lies, Marriage, Motherhood,
Hollywood and the Irrepressible Urge to Say What I Think"
(HarperCollins, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   In March she performed in a cabaret show on the London stage. The
actress, who has performed as a singer in several venues and has
recorded four jazz albums, also has co-starred in a number of movies
since making her film debut in "The Last Picture Show" (1971).</TE>
<TE>   She is a native of Memphis, Tenn., where she also owns a home.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Woolf at Coldwell Banker, Sherman Oaks, has the listing on the
San Fernando Valley home.</TE>
<TE>   Fess Parker, who played Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett on TV
during the '50s and '60s and now owns a winery in the Santa Ynez
Valley, and his wife, Marcy, have listed their Montecito home on a
golf course at $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1997, the Mediterranean-style home has three bedroom
suites, all with walk-in closets and marble bathrooms; four
fireplaces; a pool; a pool house and a three-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 77, and his wife, a singer, have owned their home in
the gated community of Birnam Wood Golf Club since 1998 but have
become disenchanted with the commute to their Fess Parker Vineyard in
Foxen Canyon, where they also have a home, and the Fess Parker Wine
Country Inn and Spa in Los Olivos.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Encell, director of the Estates Division of Prudential
California Realty, and Paul O'Keeffe of Joyce Gibb Realtors, both in
Montecito, share the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Debbi Morgan, who co-stars with Lea Thompson in the new Lifetime
series "For the People," has purchased a Hollywood Hills home for
about $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, formerly owned by baseball star Matt Williams of the
Arizona Diamondbacks and his actress-wife, Michelle Johnson, has
three bedrooms in nearly 2,700 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1951, the gated contemporary also has a new kitchen and
bathrooms, including a steam shower. On the grounds are a pool, a spa
and a grassy yard.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who portrays a newly elected L.A. district attorney on
"For the People," played Mae Thelma Carter, the wife of Denzel
Washington's character Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, in "The Hurricane"
(1999). She has made recurring guest appearances on the WB series
"Charmed" as the evil Seer and previously appeared on many daytime
dramas.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Vincent Moore of Re/Max, Sunset Boulevard, represented
Morgan in her purchase, and Judy Cycon of Prudential John Aaroe,
Beverly Hills, had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Paddy Cullen, associate producer of "My Best Friend's Wedding"
(1997) and producer of "The Brothers" (2001), has just finished an
eight-month restoration of a Hollywood Hills house built in 1923 for
actor Richard Dix.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen bought the walled and gated Italian-style home last year
for close to its $859,000 asking price. The 2,600-square-foot house
has four bedrooms and two bathrooms plus a guest unit. The living
room has a Batchelder fireplace and a sun room. The home also has a
pool, spa and city views.</TE>
<TE>   Dix was one of a few actors who made the transition from silent
pictures to talkies. He was best known for his cowboy roles and
earned an Oscar nomination for his part in "Cimarron" (1931). He died
in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen is also executive producer of the upcoming romantic comedy
"Down With Love," starring Renee Zellweger, Ewan McGregor and David
Hyde Pierce. The movie finished shooting this summer and is due out
in April.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Sill of Prudential John Aaroe, Beverly Hills, represented
Cullen in her purchase; Vida Namouli of Coldwell Banker had the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen Westside homes have sold for more than $10 million each
so far this year, in contrast with 12 for the same period last year,
according to Cecelia Waeschle, the Coldwell Banker broker who has
tracked area high-end sales for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-one Westside homes have sold at more than $5 million each
this year, in contrast with 48 for the same time frame in 2001, she
said, and 190 sold at more than $3 million each this year, compared
to 158 for the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   One Westside sale is pending at close to $30 million. The biggest
deal that closed escrow so far this year was for a Bel-Air home that
sold for nearly $21 million. The seller was Kevin Wendle, chief
executive officer and co-founder of the Internet movie guide Ifilm.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the highest home sale in the area was $30 million for
the Malibu home of the late Mark Hughes, chief executive officer of
Herbalife.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Stallone's nearly $15-million Beverly Hills-area sale to
media mogul Sumner Redstone and Dick Clark's $15-million Malibu
purchase are among the highest of the Westside home sales recorded
from January through August of this year.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Before You Redo Your Loan, Do the Math" by Diane Wedner
(Aug. 25):</LD>
<LD>   For homeowners who already are more than halfway through their
loan, there is a 10-year, fixed-rate, fully amortized loan under a
FannieMae/Freddie Mac program. People refinance to save not on the
"nominal" rate of interest per se, but to save on the aggregates of
principal and interest over the remaining life of the debt
obligation.</LD>
<LD>   Also, many lenders will waive the pre-payment penalty to their
borrowers if they are the holders of the existing loans. For example,
Downey Savings Bank has on several occasions waived the pre-payment
penalty for their existing borrowers who want to refinance.</LD>
<TE>   Other big lenders who keep the loans in their portfolios do the
same. Those lenders who insist on not waiving the penalty are usually
those lenders who do not keep and service their own loans but have
already sold them into the secondary market.</TE>

<LD>Home buyers need to be alert to some facts in today's residential
market.</LD>
<LD>   First, the majority of homes for sale were built (in the Valley
and much of Los Angeles) in the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, even if a home
has been upgraded, it is still a 40-to 50-year-old (or older) home.
It may have obsolete but functional features such as galvanized
plumbing, wood shingle roofing, evaporative air cooling system and
acoustical ceilings.</LD>
<LD>   The seller is under no obligation to replace any of these systems
unless it is nonfunctional, damaged or hazardous. Nor is the seller
obligated to credit the buyer the funds to upgrade any of these
features.</LD>
<TE>   Buyers' agents should make this clear up front to avoid serious
conflicts after a home inspection. The most contentious part of a
real estate sale is the demand buyers often make to upgrade or
replace obsolete features.</TE>

<HD>A Bungalow Returns to Retro</HD>
<DH>A South Pasadena kitchen looks more old-fashioned after a
remodel--and that's the point</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE GRINGERI-BROWN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When we moved into our South Pasadena bungalow in 1986, the kitchen
had louver windows, cabinets in disrepair, a hideous vinyl floor with
a dirt-catching gold pattern and no good place for a standard-size
refrigerator. There was a '70s bender-board wall behind the stove,
which was a superb grease magnet.</LD>
<LD>   On the plus side, the kitchen had its original yellow-and-green
tile and porcelain sink and 1923 cabinets, complete with built-in
ironing board and curvaceous doors under the sink. A friend made me
promise never to rip out those scalloped doors.</LD>
<LD>   In the following 15 years, my husband, Jim, and I did basic
repairs to the drawers and cabinets, removed the bender-board facade,
painted and pulled up five layers of vinyl flooring, plywood,
asbestos tile and adhesive.</LD>
<TE>   This latter job was a marriage tester as we sat and chipped off
the final flooring layer in laborious 1-inch chunks, which took days,
or maybe it was weeks. The felt backing and mastic proved too much
for us, so we called in a professional refinisher, who revealed the
beautiful original Douglas fir flooring.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some bungalow kitchens, ours has plenty of counter space.
The sink had some sizable chips, but I was loath to rip out the tile
to replace the sink or install a dishwasher. There remained a wish
list of kitchen improvements, but as the years went by and I learned
more about bungalows I realized that my priorities and taste were
evolving.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately the changes we had made--contemporary track lighting,
additional upper cabinets from IKEA and inexpensive knobs--were
easily reversible. It was a blessing that our budget precluded a
whole-kitchen make-over that might have been wrong for this modest
bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Jane Powell and Linda Svendsen's "Bungalow Kitchens"
(Gibbs Smith), we recently completed a kitchen face lift that leaves
some visitors wondering what's changed--which is just fine with us.
Over the course of six months we:</TE>
<TE>   * Sent the cabinet doors out to have 70 years of paint stripped
off.</TE>
<TE>   * Had cracked portions of the ceiling and wall plaster repaired
and skim coated.</TE>
<TE>   * Installed decorative moldings on contemporary cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   * Painted cabinet exteriors and varnished interiors.</TE>
<TE>   * Painted walls and ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   * Replaced lighting with period and reproduction fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   * Had new wood-frame double-hung windows installed.</TE>
<TE>   * Refurbished or replaced existing hinges and knobs.</TE>
<TE>   * Refinished the Douglas fir floor.</TE>
<TE>   Of these projects, the floor refinishing proved to be a real
challenge. The urethane coating that had been applied about 10 years
before had worn thin in spots, and the floor had some longitudinal
cracks that needed repair.</TE>
<TE>   Our bungalow was built without subflooring, so the vertical-grain
Douglas fir is the only thing between us and the floor joists, making
us doubly cautious about repeat sandings. We were assured that the
urethane layer could be removed with finish sanders. Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining coating proved very tough to cut through, but one
belt sander, two finish sanders and multiple coats of paint stripper
later, we were able to apply an environmentally safe oil-based sealer
to the period floor.</TE>
<TE>   We already had a '50s stove that we'd hauled to Minnesota and back
that looked great in our period kitchen, but the perfect refrigerator
proved elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Originally our bungalow undoubtedly had an icebox on the adjoining
service porch, and the slim space next to the stove was only large
enough for an apartment-size model. We kept looking, considering
built-in, under-counter and vintage-look models. None seemed right
for the room or the space: too tall, too small or inappropriate for a
simple bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   A bungalow-savvy friend turned us on to a retro-looking
refrigerator from Germany, manufactured by Muller. It was the right
width--less than 30 inches--and came in more than 200 colors.</TE>
<TE>   We were able to custom order it with a larger refrigerator section
instead of a bottom drawer, and went for jadite green, although white
would have been a safe choice. It's not frost-free, which gave me
pause, but in the nine months we've had it, it has required
defrosting only twice--a 15-minute job. The fridge took five months
to arrive, but it really enhances the kitchen; most people think it's
old.</TE>
<TE>   We still have our nearly 20-year-old portable dishwasher, which we
use daily as a work island. And the microwave and TV aren't under
wraps; they're small white models that sit out on a painted chest of
drawers under one of the newish upper cabinets. But we have no
garbage disposal, trash compactor or appliance garage; those are
things the first owners didn't need, nor do we.</TE>
<TE>   A period porcelain wall sconce and schoolhouse light were found at
online auctions, as were advertising art and fruit packing labels
from the '20s-to-'40s era. Vintage hand towels and an old
cherry-print fabric that was wrapped around our built-in ironing
board were turned into window valances. Hall china, Jadite glassware
and period kitchen clocks also add to the room's bygone-era
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure many visitors completely overlook our kitchen or think it
represents a prime "before" room, crying out for stainless steel
appliances, granite counters and recessed lighting.</TE>
<TE>   But we're happy with this decidedly old-fashioned room and use it
daily for simple family meals and gourmet dinners with friends. It's
just right for us and our bungalow.</TE>

<LD>Affordable housing remains a problem for low-income Americans in most
housing markets in the country, according to a report by the
Washington, D.C.-based National Multi Housing Council.</LD>
<LD>   The study, titled "Housing Affordability: The Apartment Universe,"
found that despite the economic expansion of the late 1990s, there
has been little improvement in affordability problems since 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The report found that 26% of apartment renters (3.8 million)
received some sort of federal housing assistance in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 74% of unassisted apartment renters, 23% (2.3 million) paid
30% to 50% of their income on rent plus utilities, and 19% (1.9
million), more than 50% of their income on rent plus utilities.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't reliance on luck that enabled Shelley and Steve Hall to
spend just one day looking for a house and to close escrow three
weeks later.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, the trouble-free purchase of a two-story, 13-year-old Cape
Cod in Brea for $450,000 was the payoff for months of planning and a
determination to remain easygoing. For them, that precluded chiseling
the seller repeatedly on the price or asking for fixes on such
minuscule problems as small tears in window screens.</LD>
<LD>   "Why would we ask her to fix those things," Shelley, 35, said,
"when our intention was to close in three weeks?"</LD>
<TE>   The Halls' home-buying mission began last year when they decided
to leave the Bay Area, where they bought their first home in 1995,
and move back to Southern California to be near family and friends.
Shelley grew up in Long Beach; Steve is an Oxnard native.</TE>
<TE>   Though Steve, a history teacher, could find a job many places, as
an engineer who tests medical devices, Shelley could most likely find
work in San Diego, north Orange County or the Ventura/Santa Barbara
region.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego was ruled out because neither of them was familiar with
the area. Ventura/Santa Barbara has a growing medical technology
sector, but it's too small to assure that Shelley could change jobs
if she wished. North Orange County was finally selected when Steve
said, "Why can't we live near Rich and Wendy?"--referring to friends
who live in Brea. Other friends, including two of Shelley's childhood
buddies and a former co-worker, also live in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew where we wanted to be and why," Shelley said. The
decision allowed them to avoid a problem she had observed in other
couples looking for a home, she said, who "are not even on the same
page" in terms of location. "They're hoping to find one randomly.
Finally one caves in because they're tired."</TE>
<TE>   With the location narrowed--either Brea or Fullerton--Shelley took
a job in the Bay Area that she knew would soon be transferred to
north Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Then the couple searched for a real estate agent to list their
Santa Clara home. To meet Realtors familiar with the neighborhood,
they toured open houses nearby and explained their needs. From those
meetings, they chose an agent from the two who "were sharp enough to
tune into us," Shelley said, rejecting an agent who continued trying
to sell them the house he was showing.</TE>
<TE>   With their house on the market, priced $10,000 lower than similar
homes to induce a quick sale, the Halls used the Internet
extensively, first to find out how much they could afford to spend
and then to get familiar with homes in Brea or Fullerton in that
price range.</TE>
<TE>   From Countrywide Home Loans (www.countrywide.com), the couple
discovered they could qualify for a home costing up to $500,000. This
was based on Shelley's salary and half of Steve's anticipated salary.
With a more aggressive approach, the couple could have purchased a
home in the $800,000 range, but they didn't want to be strapped with
the large monthly payments that would require.</TE>
<TE>   To read up on houses for sale in Brea and Fullerton, they looked
at Realtor.com, HomeGain.com and www.winston4homes.com, the site of
Fullerton Realtor Winston Creel.</TE>
<TE>   Then they chose an agent recommended by friends. Mary Hutchison,
an agent with Coldwell Banker in Brea, has sold real estate in the
area since 1977 and raised her children there.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison encourages all her buyers to get pre-approved or well
pre-qualified for a loan before looking for a home. If buyers are not
looking in the right price range, Hutchison said, "it's heartbreaking
to them and a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   The Halls next considered their priorities in a home, which were
somewhat contradictory. They wanted the charm of an old Craftsman
house but the conveniences of a new house and at least 2,000 square
feet of space.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot to say for new houses, like insulation," said
Steve, noting that their previous house was built in 1956 and had a
lot of "mid-century charm." The Halls finally decided that if they
could find a nice house on a street with large trees, they could give
up a lot of other things.</TE>
<TE>   They rejected fixer-uppers, which Steve called "the trap of
potential," and managed their expectations by telling themselves:
We're never going to find the perfect house. In their Internet
searches, the Halls came across many houses that fit their needs and
wants but didn't let themselves fixate on any of them. "We're not
going to get this one," Shelley said in one search. "We haven't sold
our house."</TE>
<TE>   Their determination to have escrow close on their old house before
focusing on the next was motivated partly by the competitive real
estate market, where sellers are not likely to accept offers with a
sale contingency. It was also Shelley's way of avoiding frustration
if their sale fell through. "That's too much stress," she said. "I
don't like disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday of the week escrow was closing, the couple packed up
their belongings. The next day they sent them into storage, and on
Wednesday "we started driving south," Steve said. In Shelley's
relocation package, the couple received a month of furnished
temporary housing.</TE>
<TE>   Friday of that week, a rainy day last December, the Halls went to
an ATM to confirm that escrow had been completed and the funds were
in their account.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they met with Hutchison, the only task left was
selecting a house. Hutchison drove them to more than a dozen houses
of varying ages that met the criteria they had discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Two seemed likely candidates, and the couple came back early that
evening to walk the respective neighborhoods. "You see the sights,
you smell the smells, you hear the sounds," Steve said.</TE>
<TE>   Both houses were fairly new, but the neighborhoods seemed sterile
and cookie-cutter to the Halls. Near the first house, they decided
the din of traffic from a nearby boulevard was unacceptable. As they
approached the second house, though, they turned a corner and were
astonished to see a "you-won't-believe-the-Christmas-lights street,"
which Shelley said boded well for the neighborliness of the area.
"You can imagine people talking to each other."</TE>
<TE>   The house the couple chose has two stories with a mix of blue-gray
siding, tan stucco and white trim.</TE>
<TE>   On the downside, it doesn't have a downstairs bedroom, which the
couple had wanted, and it's a "snout house," meaning the garage
sticks out at the front of the property.</TE>
<TE>   On the upside, when the garage doors on the other snout houses in
the neighborhood opened, they revealed a community of
do-it-yourselfers. "There's a lot of table saws on this street,"
Shelley said. And the house has more than the 2,000 square feet of
space they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   To facilitate a quick purchase, the Halls offered the seller
$450,000 for the house, which was listed at $459,000.</TE>
<TE>   When the property report came back with a list of minor problems,
the couple agreed to fix those themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We were prepared to overlook anything little," Shelley said.</TE>
<TE>   After 29 days in temporary housing, the couple moved into their
new home. Steve began his job hunt and was hired recently as a
librarian at La Puente High School.</TE>
<TE>   The months of preparation and footwork paid off. "We've got
everything we need down here," Shelley said. "Two jobs and a house."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy to be back," Steve said.</TE>

<LD>Title insurers paid about $460 million in claims in 2001, compared
with $350 million in 2000, according to a recent survey by the
American Land Title Assn.</LD>
<LD>   These payments were made to compensate insured homeowners for
losses they experienced under policies issued to them, or to defend
their titles from claims.</LD>
<LD>   The survey of 420 abstracters and agent operations showed that
title problems arise in one out of four real estate transactions.</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, this represented about 1.6 million of the 6.5 million
residential real estate sales that closed.</TE>

<LD>Another kind of castling is drawing players to the sands at Chess
Park near the original Muscle Beach south of the Santa Monica Pier.
These days Mark Rosenberg, voluntary park "concierge without a
title," castles, kibbutzes and generally holds court at a new playing
area with snazzy giant chess-piece sculptures and seating for 140.
The 52-year-old Palms resident, who teaches the game privately and in
Los Angeles Unified School District enrichment programs, was
instrumental in planning the new city-funded facility, which was
unveiled in 2000. His standard opening gambit: "Welcome to Brain
Beach!"</LD>
<LD>   What is that number "E4C6" on your sun hat?</LD>
<LD>   An international algebraic notation for an opening defense move
I'm famous for.</LD>
<TE>   Since this is Los Angeles, let's have some Chess Park
name-dropping.</TE>
<TE>   Since we opened in October of 2000, I've seen Ron Howard bring his
son to the park. Then there was a player called "Dick" who turned out
to be Richard Riordan, [then-] mayor of L.A. Riordan can really play.
There's an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor here who teaches children
and calls everyone "pussycat." And some of the highest-rated children
in the country come down here to play.</TE>
<TE>   Is it true that Hollywood has a chess heritage?</TE>
<TE>   Here's a Hollywood story. In 1933, Cecil B. DeMille was the
arbiter of chess matches between [international master] Herman
Steiner and Jose Raul Capablanca. Jose was the world champion from
Cuba. DeMille had actors dressed up playing the life-sized pieces.
Steiner had a chess club in Hollywood for 40 years. Bogart was a
master there. Rumor said he hustled [chess] on Coney Island.</TE>
<TE>   Were you a child prodigy?</TE>
<TE>   I didn't really learn to play until I was 30. My father inspired
this park, though. He was a doctor who did free dental work in the
Gaza Strip. He and other L.A. dentists built a dental bus in the
1970s and took it to Gaza. To show people not to hate, you have to do
something, not just talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   Who are the best players in L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   The Russians, the Armenians and the Filipinos. In Armenia, like in
Russia, it was always cultural, knowing chess like a piece by Ravel
or a Kandinsky painting. Starting in the 1960s, the Soviets sent
master teachers to the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Why don't I see women playing here?</TE>
<TE>   Tradition and intimidation. There are good women players in
Southern California. A few years ago, a woman won the oldest chess
tournament in the world, in Hastings, England. But here, 7th-and
8th-grade girls don't want to appear smart. Like in soccer, it takes
a breaking down of the old way.</TE>
<TE>   Give us a weird piece of arcane chess trivia.</TE>
<TE>   OK. In Israel and Russia, the king has no cross on his head. How's
that?</TE>
<TE>   Now I know why Bobby Fischer was such a loon. Do you agree with
the cliche that chess is the mental equivalent of war?</TE>
<TE>   I like to see it as performance art. Some days you are better than
others, but you're in the moment. They do use chess at West Point as
a training vehicle. I can see spies using it, because chess gives
much insight into your personal psychology. Are you looking to
counterattack? Are you aggressive? Passive? Some favor positional
ideas, some players maneuver around a lot. Some are anal-retentive.
Henry Kissinger was once asked to play, a game was set up with
Brezhnev. But Kissinger declined. He didn't want to show how he
analyzed or probed things, or give any insight into his personality.
A very smart move.</TE>
<TE>   Just how far does chess fanaticism go?</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember when the U.S. was bombing Yugoslavia? We shut off
their electricity. A few months later I was sent apologies from
Belgrade because they were three months late in publishing the Chess
Informant [journal], which offended chess masters worldwide. All the
high-level players read it.</TE>
<TE>   Why is chess a great sport?</TE>
<TE>   It's inexpensive. The pieces last forever. It [is accessible to]
everyone. At one time 30% of our players down here were homeless.
There was a movie studio executive who kept getting beat by the grip
on his set. He was very upset about this, and he came to me for
lessons so he could beat him. I said, "Who is this grip? He could be
a master!" We have short-order cooks in this town who are great
players. It's a level playing field.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise the pieces would fall off the board.</TE>
<TE>   I can see that.</TE>

<DH>Dean Corey Is Taking the Philharmonic Society of Orange
County on a Wild Ride, Sprinkling the Likes of Frog Operas and Muddy
Waters Tributes Among Performances by the World's Greatest Classical
Performers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>Randy Lewis is a Times staff writer based in Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are plenty of things about Dean Corey that wouldn't surprise
you. The head of an organization such as the Philharmonic Society of
Orange County is supposed to be erudite, energetic, creative and,
above all, sophisticated.</LD>
<LD>   Corey is all of those things.</LD>
<LD>   How else would he be able to persuade the mighty Berlin and Vienna
Philharmonic orchestras, singers Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel,
conductors Daniel Barenboim and Claudio Abbado, composer Tan Dun and
choreographer Mark Morris to include unassuming little Costa Mesa on
their tour itineraries?</LD>
<TE>   What sets Corey apart from the garden-variety arts administrator
is that he's equally comfortable chatting about the instrumental
wizardry of Isaac Stern or Jimi Hendrix, analyzing the dramatic
subtext of the New Testament or the Harry Potter books, or hobnobbing
with Abbado or The Lady Chablis, the real-life transvestite
hero/heroine of John Berendt's bestseller, "Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil." He's not above the occasional bad pun--he named his
beloved black Labrador Luc de Chateau Lafeet and calls him a
"juvenile doglinquent." And few who travel in his circles can pull
off the rock 'n' roll attitude Corey exhibits when sizing up
fast-rising musician Andreas Staier as a "kick-ass harpsichordist."</TE>
<TE>   The straight-talking Texan, who came to the Philharmonic Society
in 1993 after three years as director of development for the San
Diego Symphony, has been steadfastly, and not so quietly, helping to
redefine what "culture" means in Orange County. At the same time,
he's working to reshape attitudes outside the county about the
validity of what goes on behind the Orange Curtain, and he's
transformed the Philharmonic Society, which was a respected but staid
group when he came aboard, into a forward-thinking arts organization.
In the four years since the 48-year-old society launched its annual
six-week Eclectic Orange Festival, Corey has brought numerous works
more typical of the Brooklyn Academy or Lincoln Center to the
community best known to the outside world as the home of Disneyland
and the South Coast Plaza shopping center. The eclectic programming
reflects Corey's sense of adventure. Some examples:</TE>
<TE>   --The world premiere of Dun's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
concerto.</TE>
<TE>   --A tribute to blues great Muddy Waters.</TE>
<TE>   --The Southern California premiere of Morris' staging of
Jean-Philippe Rameau's "Platee"; in Corey's words, "an opera about a
frog."</TE>
<TE>   --The West Coast premiere of Philip Glass' Symphony No. 5, a work
co-commissioned with Brooklyn's Next Wave Festival, the Salzburg
Festival and the Flanders Festival in Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   --One highlight of Eclectic Orange Festival 2002--which runs Oct.
11 through Nov. 10--will be the first West Coast performances of "La
Pasion Segun San Marcos," a treatment of the gospel of St. Mark using
idiomatic Brazilian music by Argentine-born, Boston-based composer
Osvaldo Golijov.</TE>
<TE>   Neither hipness nor money alone are enough to lure the Berlin and
Vienna Philharmonic orchestras, which have made exclusive West Coast
visits to Costa Mesa in recent years and are expected to return. The
Vienna Phil's concerts for the Philharmonic Society have been its
only West Coast appearances since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a group of people who are dedicated to music," says
Clemens Hellsberg, president of the Vienna Philharmonic. "That
usually starts with one certain person, and here it is Dean. He is
like a shepherd out of the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that the people he leads are sheep," Hellsberg adds with a
smile. "They are real music lovers, and they trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Some subscribers have groused about part of what Corey brings
them, although most have hung in. "I like it when our die-hard
subscribers go, 'I wasn't sure about that, but I really liked it,' "
Corey says. "I love to open their world up a little bit." Attendance
for Eclectic Orange has been rising since it began, and is expected
to jump markedly for this year's festival because of heavy advance
sales on the centerpiece event, the U.S. premiere of the Paris-based
equestrian troupe Theatre Zingaro's "Triptyk."</TE>
<TE>   Corey is open to trying just about anything--from that opera about
a frog to punk rock. Eclectic Orange Festival-goers spent an evening
in 1999 and again in 2000 at Linda's Doll Hut, a 100-year-old
roadside bar in Anaheim that has been home to hundreds of roots-rock,
punk, alternative, country and rockabilly bands over the years. "That
was great," Corey says, laughing at the memory of luring high-society
types into a bona fide dive bar. "It was a good group--a real mixture
of people who hang around the place and never leave, and our
subscribers, who never would have gone there if they hadn't been with
our group."</TE>
<TE>   Corey isn't about to suggest he's leading ignorant masses out of
cultural darkness. Rather, he's responding to organic changes that
have taken place as the county has evolved from a region of political
and cultural conservatism. With its multiplicity of ethnic,
political, religious and economic subpopulations, the county now
transcends pigeonholing.</TE>
<TE>   "There obviously needed to be some changes because audiences were
changing," Corey says.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, loyal classical music lovers in most major
metropolitan areas have signed up for a full season of performances
by various orchestras, soloists and ensembles. They assiduously
renewed those subscriptions, then passed them on to their children,
who continued the tradition. In recent decades, however, that
tradition has withered as technology has provided myriad new ways for
people to spend their time and money.</TE>
<TE>   One of Corey's first experiments was booking the youth-friendly
Kronos Quartet, a group with one foot in the classical world, the
other in pop.</TE>
<TE>   But his biggest revelation came from, of all places, Trader Joe's,
a favorite haunt for him and his wife, Kaly. Other people walk into
Trader Joe's and see bargains on wine, chocolate-covered almonds and
biodegradable detergent. Corey saw The Future of Classical Music.
"Theoretically they don't have to carry a damned thing consistently,"
he says. "The point is, they're out there finding interesting stuff,
getting a good deal on it and passing it on.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Eclecticism came early to Corey, who grew up in Arlington, Texas.
His late father, a music teacher, represented the traditional side of
classical music. Yet he exposed his son not only to Beethoven and
Bach but to Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, whose music some
audiences still struggle to understand half a century later. Corey
has done his best to pass that sense of cultural adventure on to his
children from his first marriage. His daughter, Courtney, is an
actress who was in the cast of a nationally touring production of
"Rent" earlier this year, while his son, Adam, works for ABC News in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   As a teen in the early '60s, Corey focused on learning to play the
French horn. Yet he was cognizant of what the Beatles, the Beach
Boys, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa and other rock musicians were doing
to expand the vistas of pop music.</TE>
<TE>   His sin fronteras (without borders) attitude was honed as he
majored in music at the University of North Texas, and further
refined through postgraduate work at Yale University in the early
'70s.</TE>
<TE>   Corey tells of a pivotal experience during his first stint as an
arts administrator at the Ft. Worth Symphony in the late '70s. He was
trying to land a $10,000 contract for a performance. Corey sweated as
the man looked over Corey's contract proposal, then looked up and
drawled, "Aww, hell, Dean, let's do it!"</TE>
<TE>   What has stuck with him is an impatience with anyone who bemoans
the loss of musical traditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Music has changed, and it's not going to go back," he says.
"People have asked, 'Why do you do all these wacky things? How come
you put on an opera about a frog?' In this day and age, there is a
conservatism--and not just in Orange County--a type of conservatism,
almost regression, going on in this country. There seems to be even
less of a spirit of derring-do."</TE>
<TE>   Corey wants none of it. His motto would be, "Aww, hell, let's do
it."</TE>

<DH>The State Wants to Build a Second Prison in Tiny Delano,
Claiming the $600-Million Project Will Make Life Better for Hard-Luck
Locals. Believe That if You Want, but the Promised Prosperity of the
First Penitentiary Remains a Mirage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW HELLER</AU>
<BD>Matthew Heller last wrote for the magazine about former
Oxnard Police Det. Dennis McMaster and the gang-related murder
conviction he helped overturn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Route 99 bisects the hardscrabble central valley farm town of
Delano from north to south. Eleventh Avenue takes you east into the
business district. Just before you cross the Southern Pacific
Railroad tracks, you can see empty lots and the fire-scorched ruins
of what once was Delano's "Chinatown" district. Redevelopment got rid
of what the city considered a crime-ridden blight--29 bars and
nightclubs in only three blocks--but nothing has taken its place.</LD>
<LD>   A short distance to the east, Central Valley Office Supply's
neighbors on one block of Main Street include a 98-Cent Market, the
99-Cent Delano Discount market, a cash advance center and an
abandoned theater. "There's not many things to do here," complains
16-year-old Nancy Arredondo. "Teenagers don't know what to do except
get in trouble with the police." The city has provided park benches
to improve the ambience, but Shawn Clark, the office supply store's
owner, describes it as "a park-like atmosphere for vagrants to hang
out in."</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, Delano's plight isn't terribly unusual among poor, small
towns across the country. But it does have a distinction most others
do not. On top of the poverty and blight, Delano can stack dashed
hopes.</LD>
<TE>   More than a decade ago, state officials convinced Delano city
leaders that the 2,450-bed North Kern State Prison would provide a
badly needed economic boost to the town. City fathers, in turn, sold
North Kern State to citizens as a panacea for a town wracked by
double-digit unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   The city embraced the prison when it opened in April 1993. After
all, this is a community whose history is etched with hope. Founded
as a railroad town in 1873, Delano owes much of its growth to its
rich soil and a steady flow of Latino immigrants who pick table
grapes, kiwi fruit and other agricultural products. It was here that
Cesar Chavez worked in the vineyards and, in 1962, where he
established what became the United Farm Workers union.</TE>
<TE>   The state is now building a second prison in Delano--the state's
24th new penitentiary in 20 years--amid more predictions of better
days to come. Just down the two-lane blacktop from North Kern State,
construction workers are busy clearing 640 acres that are the site
for "Delano II." It eventually will house 4,500 inmates, most of them
violent offenders. Clark--who hustles constantly for new business and
is one of the few locals to profit from the first prison--can hardly
wait. "It gives me goose bumps just thinking about having another
prison in town," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a few other people who live and work in Delano are getting
goose bumps about the new prison, too, but for an entirely different
reason. They wonder what happened to their "gray gold"--the river of
jobs, sales tax revenue and other economic goodies that were supposed
to flow from having a prison nearby. They now believe they were sold
fool's gold, that--notwithstanding the occasional success story such
as Clark's--a pall of economic gloom as thick as the Central Valley's
tule fog still envelops their town. With the new prison set to open
in 2004, Jean Flores, a trustee of the Delano Joint Unified School
District, speaks for many in this forlorn little place. "Basically,
to me, Delano is like a ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   Delano II may, in fact, be the most controversial prison project
in California history. It was first proposed in the early 1990s, but
the state chose to build a prison at Corcoran in nearby Kings County.
After Gov. Gray Davis took office in 1999--he received $2 million in
campaign contributions from the correctional officers union--the new
governor resurrected the plan for Delano II and included $335 million
in funding for it in his first budget. Most of the money would come
from lease-revenue bonds, which do not require voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   In the Legislature, Kern County Assemblyman Dean Florez took the
reins, creating a bill that authorized the corrections department to
build a 2,248-cell maximum-security prison. It passed with
overwhelming bipartisan support in June 1999. "AB 1535 not only
addresses the [prison] overcrowding problem but also provides a
needed economic boost in Delano by creating an estimated 700 new jobs
and $4 million to the local economy," Florez proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   To critics of the state's prison-building binge, the timing could
not have been more dubious. In 1999, crime rates dropped for the
eighth straight year; the state's inmate population showed its
smallest increase in 20 years and was almost 10,000 below the state's
forecast. Still, agency officials insisted that, based on
California's projected growth, another prison was justified,
particularly one housing the most violent offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But as Delano II proceeded through environmental review, activist
groups--including Critical Resistance and the National Lawyers Guild
Prison Law Project--filed suit in Kern County to block the project.
They claimed the state had not adequately addressed the potential
environmental impact of building what amounted to a small city. They
also raised the "absolute lack of a necessity of having a [second]
prison" and challenged the wisdom of developing land that could be
used for agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Another plaintiff had an unusual client--an endangered rodent with
habitat on the proposed Delano II site. Superior Court Judge Roger M.
Randall soon ruled that only the Friends of the Kangaroo Rat were
actually present in Kern County and had legal "standing" to sue. In
June 2001, he gave them a partial victory, ruling that the state
needed to take a closer look at issues such as water and traffic
impacts.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last year, opposition to Delano II also was mounting
on the political front. Inmate numbers were continuing to decline
(from 162,000 last year to the current 156,000), while the prison
agency reported a record budget overrun of $277 million. This wasn't
exactly good news with the state facing a budget shortfall projected
at about $20 billion. "All we're going to do is build on the problem
you have" by authorizing another prison, state Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles) lectured corrections officials.</TE>
<TE>   Delano, it turns out, isn't alone in its disappointment. Other
poor farming towns in the Central Valley are waiting for the promised
benefits from prisons built in their midst. Critical Resistance and
its allies have pointed to data indicating that the Central Valley's
prisons have been an economic bust despite $2 billion in construction
and half a billion dollars a year in payroll. Unemployment in the
valley, for example, remained at three times the state average, and
less than 10% of prison jobs went to people from the host
communities.</TE>
<TE>   But on April 4, Judge Randall approved the state's revised
environmental impact report. Then, in June, a budget bill that
includes funding for Delano II emerged from a conference committee of
the state Assembly and Senate. It now awaits a final vote. The
current price tag, including interest on the lease-revenue bonds:
about $600 million--nearly twice the original estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the state's major newspapers have joined the chorus of
opposition. "Surely [Gov.] Davis can recognize that building Delano
now would be a boondoggle," the Los Angeles Times said in a recent
editorial. The activists have taken the legal battle to an appeals
court in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "The department is hell-bent on building Delano II," says Rose
Braz, an attorney with Critical Resistance in Oakland. "Our coalition
is hell-bent on stopping Delano II."</TE>
<TE>   Although contractors for the state have started grading the Delano
II site, they do not have a green light to proceed with construction
of any buildings. You won't find any of Delano's 38,000 residents
there chained to bulldozers and, around town, there's no visible sign
of the controversy. The City Council signed off on the revised
environmental impact report by a 3-2 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Delano, nevertheless, could be Exhibit A in the case against
prisons as engines of economic progress. "They're down at the bottom"
of prison towns in rural California, says Ruth Wilson Gilmore, a
professor of geography at UC Berkeley who is writing a book about the
economic impact of the state's prisons. "That town's doing very
poorly."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Clark, on the other hand, is doing quite well. when he
bought his office supply store in Delano in 1992, it sold little more
than "novelty crap," he says. "We were a big nothing," with sales of
only $16,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   But Clark, a gravel-voiced entrepreneur who grew up in Delano, saw
opportunity in the fields just west of town where the corrections
agency was building North Kern State Prison during the nation's
largest prison construction boom. Long before the facility received
its first inmate in 1993, Clark was driving out from Delano in his
pickup and hustling orders from management.</TE>
<TE>   "When they had three people out there, I delivered a dozen pencils
and two rolls of fax paper," he says. "I got there within 15 minutes
of their phone call."</TE>
<TE>   Clark learned how to navigate the prison system's daunting
procurement bureaucracy and regulations--"The guy in the [warehouse
receiving] 'cage' knows more than the procurement officer," he
advises. When the state went into a budget crisis, Clark, unlike many
other vendors, still accepted the prison's purchase orders.</TE>
<TE>   Clark now supplies everything from shower curtains to television
sets to North Kern State--as well as to 20 other state prisons in
California. If a prison needs it, Clark--operating like a civilian
version of "Catch-22's" Milo Minderbinder--can usually get it.
Central Valley Office Supply is still based in a modest store on
Delano's drab Main Street, but now it generates about $1.5 million a
year in sales, about half of that to prisons. "They gave me an
opportunity," Clark says in his cramped office, which is decorated as
a shrine to NFL great Joe Montana.</TE>
<TE>   But Clark's success as a statewide prison supplier also pokes a
hole in the argument that prisons bring local prosperity: He's
getting some of the money that prison supporters claimed would go to
businesses in Avenal, Corcoran, Chowchilla and other Central Valley
prison towns that welcomed penitentiaries with open arms and visions
of gray gold.</TE>
<TE>   More than nine years after North Kern State opened, the major
retailer in Delano is a Kmart on the northern edge of town. Residents
worry it could close because of the parent company's recent
bankruptcy filing. To the west of SR 99, on the same side of town as
the prison sites, there is no commercial development beyond a
convenience store, a budget motel and a strip mall. Here many of the
town's farm laborers live in scruffy single-family homes or trailers,
and the streets are rutted with potholes. The UFW uses 40 acres for
training programs; the city uses another plot of land for sewage
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Flores has spent most of her life in Delano. She lives on the
west side and works downtown in a storefront legal office decorated
with photographs of Chavez. She is in her eighth year on the school
board and also is president of the city's police commission. Her
husband, Gil, serves on the City Council--he was one of the members
who voted against approving the Delano II environmental report.</TE>
<TE>   With a somewhat world-weary air and rings on nine of her fingers,
Flores can remember a more vibrant pre-prison downtown. "We had a
Morris department store, a fabric store, a hardware store," she says.
Now she has to drive 30 miles south to Bakersfield just to buy a
spool of thread. "Does that make sense?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   Flores also can remember the economic hope that greeted Delano's
first prison. "Everybody was under the impression there were going to
be lots of jobs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same hope that spread like locusts around the Central
Valley in the 1980s. The administration of Gov. George Deukmejian had
launched what would be a $5-billion construction program that, in the
space of less than 20 years, would triple California's total number
of prisons to 33. Amid resistance from urban residents who weren't
too keen on having prisons in their backyards, officials focused on
sparsely populated rural areas as more suitable locations. "We're
prone to work with communities that ... throw out the red carpet for
us," the director of the corrections department told the Legislature
in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The department touted the new prisons as recession-proof and
nonpolluting. In the Central Valley, it got the red carpet treatment
from towns buffeted by the instability of the region's
agriculture-based economy. Avenal opened its prison in 1987, followed
by Corcoran in 1988 and Chowchilla in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   California's agricultural drought of 1987-1992 hit Delano hard,
sending city officials out in search of their own prison. Built on
near-barren land, North Kern State Prison would be used primarily as
a reception center for inmates on their way to other institutions.
When full, according to state estimates at the time, it would employ
870 workers ranging from correctional officers to clerical
assistants, with an average annual salary of $30,500--not bad for a
community with an unemployment rate of more than 25% and a median
household income of slightly more than $21,000. The total payroll of
$26.5 million would be three times Delano's annual budget of $8.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   "This City Council, they'll turn flip-flops for something that
brings in 100 jobs, 50 jobs," observes Bob Cane, editor of the weekly
Delano Record newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expected more economic payoff than just job creation.
The economic theory also held that prison employees would patronize
local stores, fueling increased sales tax revenue. With more revenue,
the city could offer improved services. And all of that would make
Delano a more attractive place to live. A very desirable "domino
effect."</TE>
<TE>   The reality has been more like a doldrums effect. Delano residents
have gotten only between 7% and 9% of North Kern State jobs, many of
them lower-paying service positions, and unemployment is still around
26%. Per-person sales tax revenue dropped from $65.15 in 1993-1994 to
$53.15 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   As elsewhere in the Central Valley prison complex, Delano has run
into what you might call "prisonomics." Prison recruiters fish from a
statewide pool, giving no preference to local applicants. Employees
with seniority are first in line for positions at new prisons. In
Delano, where Latinos account for two-thirds of the population,
residents may not have the English-language skills or high school
diploma to qualify for the state hiring list.</TE>
<TE>   Once they work in Delano, moreover, most prison employees don't
live there, preferring the superior amenities of nearby cities such
as Bakersfield and Visalia, even if it means a 40-minute commute each
way. They might stop at the Fastrip gas station off SR 99 for morning
coffee or grab a taco at one of the fast-food restaurants, but the
significant benefits of their spending are going elsewhere. Delano's
recruitment brochure for a community development director makes no
mention of the prison among its economic attributes.</TE>
<TE>   At her office, Flores sums up what she believes North Kern State
has done for Delano. "As far as economic development, it's pretty
much shut that down," she says. Then, throwing up her hands, she
adds: "Would you like to live near a prison?"</TE>
<TE>   So what on earth is Delano doing welcoming another prison to its
fields? How come residents aren't marching to the site and chaining
themselves in protest to bulldozers, with banners proclaiming, "Save
the Kangaroo Rat" in hand?</TE>
<TE>   One hypothesis is that Delano's citizenry lacks the sophistication
and resources to analyze a major state project like a prison,
decipher an environmental impact report and mount an effective
campaign against it. That's why the burden fell on "outsider"
organizations such as Critical Resistance. Napoleon Madrid, a former
Delano mayor, points to a sense of resignation. "People had gotten
accustomed to the first prison," he says. "They look at it as almost
a foregone conclusion that the second prison is coming in."</TE>
<TE>   At the red brick, two-story City Hall, the current mayor has a
positive spin on North Kern State. "I've been supportive of the
prison from Day One," Art Armendariz says. "We needed a stimulus and
that was it." Counting North Kern State and two nearby prisons in
McFarland and Wasco, the Department of Corrections has provided jobs
for about 500 Delano residents, he estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Armendariz's enthusiasm may have something to do with his job as
community resources manager at the Wasco prison. But asked if his
loyalties are divided, he shakes his head. "No," he says. The prison
job "does not conflict" with his civic responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, a lean, energetic man equipped with two cell phones,
concedes that North Kern State has not met economic expectations. But
he believes the city can do a better job of helping residents through
the state hiring process the second time around. "It's all about
educating citizens how to go about getting a job," he says,
predicting that 25% to 30% of Delano II jobs could go to the town.</TE>
<TE>   As for boosting sales tax revenue, Armendariz says that can be
accomplished by developing the town as a regional shopping venue.
Prison employees "will shop here before they go home." He notes that
the city is negotiating with developers to transform "Chinatown" into
a multi-block commercial center.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, Shawn Clark also sees plenty of prison-related
opportunities ahead for Delano's business owners--if only they would
follow his example. "You've got to be willing to do anything to get
business," he says. "It's about putting in the effort, the time and
the money. Absolutely every prison that is built, I'll put in that
effort."</TE>
<TE>   Clark's free-market faith isn't enough, however, for activist Rose
Braz. "He would be doing well if the prison was located in Beverly
Hills," she says. "I have no doubt there's anecdotal evidence of
people benefiting [from prisons]. But globally, if you look at the
history, are prisons economic drivers? The answer is, 'No.' "</TE>
<TE>   She and others contend that Armendariz's Delano II job estimates
are too high, given the statewide competition for prison jobs, and
that he is putting the economic cart before the horse. Major
retailers, they say, will not come to Delano unless local consumers
have enough disposable income to justify it. And unless consumers get
prison jobs or other high-paying employment, they won't have that
income.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the Central Valley, the penitentiary parade goes on.
In Arvin, another economically depressed Kern County farm town, city
officials have been lobbying for a state or federal prison. "The
impact would be tremendous," enthuses Mayor Juan Olivares.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Madrid lobbied for Delano II when he was in office.
"It's a clean industry and it does provide jobs," he says. "Just one
person getting a job, that's a positive impact."</TE>
<TE>   But there's one message that Madrid feels should ring loud and
clear before the state builds any more prisons in rural California.
"People look on them as economic development tools. They're not.
Cities should not use the Department of Corrections for economic
development."</TE>

<HD>Making Peace With Figs</HD>
<DH>When Creatively Cooked, the Fruit's Sweet and Intense
Flavor Can Convert Its Biggest Skeptics</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My mother near-worshipped the dozen avocado trees that grew on our
land when I was growing up. She more than tolerated the apricot,
apple and mango trees. But without any shame and for no other reason
than a skin-deep, didn't-like-its-leaves reason, she turned a
discriminating mind--and the sharp end of a hatchet--toward the fig
tree. She didn't know it at the time, but this act had grave
significance. The fig was considered by the ancients to be a symbol
of peace.</LD>
<LD>   My mother hacked down our Black Mission fig tree. It grew back.
She tackled it again, and the tree grew back again. She repeated this
process unsuccessfully before turning to the guy digging a hole for a
swimming pool, who dumped a boulder he'd unearthed on the site where
the tree refused to die. Months later, the branches of that hardy fig
tree found their way up through the ground and around that boulder so
that the tree grew back like some crazy upside-down spider. My mother
lost the war, and she came to despise the black, mushy fruit that
continuously littered the ground around the pool.</LD>
<TE>   The fig is one of the oldest fruits known to man and one of the
sweetest. Figs are indigenous to Asia, Africa and Turkey. The fruit
was brought to North America--to Southern California specifically--in
the 1500s by Franciscan monks who set up missions from San Diego to
Sonoma, thus the name of California's most popular fresh fig, the
Black Mission.</TE>
<TE>   I like to think that, with the progress of generations, I am less
prejudiced than my mother. When I see figs in stores and at farmers'
markets, all neatly lined up and strapped into their green half-pint
boxes with a red elastic net, I want to take them home, just to prove
the point that all fruits are equal. However, until recently, I
didn't have the first idea how to cook with them. Kevin Driscoll, a
fig vendor at the Santa Monica farmers' market, suggested I call a
''fig ambassador.'' He assured me that Azmin Ghahreman, executive
chef at the St. Regis Monarch Resort in Dana Point, did ''the most
amazing things with figs.'' Turns out Ghahreman also grew up with a
fig tree in his backyard in Iran. Conversely, his mother awaited fig
season, which in California runs mid-summer to early fall, with
delight. Ghahreman and his siblings plucked the tree-ripened fruit
and popped them into their mouths like candy. And Ghahreman's mother
gave him a healthy respect for--and creative hand with--figs.</TE>
<TE>   At his suggestion, I tried different approaches--drizzling figs
with honey, baking them in a tart, and reducing the fruit and a
squeeze of lemon juice, sugar and vanilla into a jam with a deep
seedy intensity. Best of all, one sublime bite of Ghahreman's
prosciutto-wrapped figs, served with a gorgonzola cream sauce,
convinced me that the fruit is capable of bringing peace to all
people, even my fig-fearing mother.</TE>

<HD>A Rosebud of the Screen Blooms Again</HD>
<DH>Forget "Citizen Kane"--Bob Board Wants You to Know the Real
Marion Davies</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL ZOLLO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only one movie star mattered to Bob Board when he was growing up in
Long Beach during the 1930s, and that was Marion Davies. "My parents
didn't approve of her at all," he remembers with a laugh. "They said,
'Oh, she lives with this old man who is married and has children, and
they live in a castle by the beach up north.' I thought, 'Ooohh, this
does sound like an interesting person.' "</LD>
<LD>   The "old man," of course, was newspaper tycoon William Randolph
Hearst, and Board's parents were not alone in attributing Davies'
stardom to her real-life role as Hearst's mistress rather than to any
actual talent.</LD>
<LD>   Board strongly disagrees, and he's on a mission to dispel the
myths surrounding an underappreciated talent. Most people, Board
says, unfairly identify Davies with the mistress character in
"Citizen Kane." "Marion was not only a fine comedian, but also a
gifted all-around entertainer," he says, citing films such as "Peg O'
My Heart" (1933) and "Going Hollywood" (1933). "She sang, she danced
and she was beautiful. She was this radiant blond woman with a
genuine warmth. She was generous. In New York, in the early days, she
was known by poor children as the 'Christmas Lady,' " says Board, 80,
a retired actor and stand-in. As to her notorious liaison with
Hearst, Board points out that at 35 years, it outlasted most
Hollywood marriages.</LD>
<TE>   Davies, a Brooklyn native, was a painter's model before becoming a
Broadway star and "Ziegfeld Follies" performer. She was spotted
onstage by Hearst, who catapulted her to stardom in silents and
talkies; she averaged three pictures a year between 1917 and 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Davies shined as a comedian at MGM and Warner Bros., but Hearst
wanted her to be a serious leading lady, and his grousing at the
studios brought her career to a premature demise. She retired in 1937
and died of cancer in 1961. She's interred in a mausoleum at the
Hollywood Forever cemetery marked by her family name, Douras.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, Board began collecting every Marion Davies memento
he could get his hands on--lobby cards, one-sheet posters,
autographed photos, engraved dishes, a Marion mannequin and much
more. He has also hand-crafted items including a "Marionette" and
miniature dioramas of Hearst Castle in San Simeon. Along with the
items he displays, Board also keeps a profusion of Davies memorabilia
in storage rooms crammed with books, cards and more.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in Davies has been escalating, the most recent instance
being this year's Peter Bogdanovich film "The Cat's Meow," with
Kirsten Dunst portraying Davies. Board credits the Davies revival to
the Turner Classic Movies cable channel, which is giving film buffs a
chance to see her work uncut. Fan networks are burgeoning on the
Internet, he says. "A friend of mine who runs a Marion Davies Web
site in Seattle told me he gets about a thousand hits a day." That
suits Board just fine. "When I was a kid, there was a lot of laughter
about my love for Marion. This is a really nice way for things to
turn out."</TE>

<DH>A Landscaping Team Adds Drama at the Water's Edge in a
Hidden Hills Garden</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1993, Denise and David Kellogg bought a rambling '70s ranch house
in Hidden Hills with plenty of land for children and dogs to romp.
What their acre property lacked, despite a few good trees, was
character or style. ''It was basically house-plus-lawn,'' remembers
landscape architect Rob Steiner, who, with his former business
partner, Jay Griffith, arrived in 1997 to make a garden.</LD>
<LD>   The Kelloggs knew what they wanted: bold color, playful shapes,
kinetic plants that would toss and catch light outside their windows.
Since the Kelloggs have three children--Zach, 15, Ryley, 11, and
Makenna, 7--the couple also had to find a way to fence the pool,
which was oddly shaped and broadly decked in concrete.</LD>
<LD>   The designers took their cues from the long, low stucco house and
from the surrounding landscape of Hidden Hills, where white horse
fences etch the grassy hills and pepper trees cast shadows in the
summer heat. Instead of breaking up the ranch-like lot, they tried to
create a flow with massive sweeps of a few plants, which would repeat
like musical themes across the property.</LD>
<TE>   David Kellogg, a director of films and commercials whose last
movie was Disney's ''Inspector Gadget,'' sent the designers pictures
of his favorite flora--ornamental grasses, succulents and lavender.
Not only were these hearty enough for the hot, dry climate, but
planted in swaths, they would provide the drama he sought, especially
around the pool, which was to be the centerpiece of the new garden.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, the pool had to be recast as an object worthy of
the attention. This involved tearing out its decking, pouring a new,
streamlined colored coping, adding eye-catching orange waterline tile
and bringing plants close to the water's edge--orange daylilies,
stands of juncus grass, a sweep of lavender. In place of paths or
deck, the designers laid large concrete rounds, like giant poolside
bubbles, and nearby, in a carpet of sedum, they tucked unusual Agave
guiengola, with silver leaves like fish fins. To connect the pool
terrace with an upper garden and Kellogg's office, which is in a
former horse stable, they designed a simple yet imposing staircase.
It's partly hidden by a blue wall, which suggests an outdoor stage
for living and a certain mystery about other scenes it might conceal.
Perhaps the most inspired part of the revamped pool is its
semicircular, slide-away electric fence, which Griffith and Steiner
designed--and Marina Security Gate built--to run on a track and open
a full 48 feet, providing an unobscured view of the garden from the
house.</TE>
<TE>   Some plants from the pool edge reappear in front of the house,
where the designers carved out an entry walk and added
flower-and-shrub borders and alder and pepper trees to screen out the
street. On the terrace above, they planted a mixed-grass meadow with
a rustic, dreamy softness. In the late afternoon light, when the wind
ruffles grasses under the pepper trees, it's not hard to imagine
riding off into the sunset for a last look around the ranch.</TE>

<DH>As 'an Arab American Who Grew Up Delivering Poultry for a
Rabbi,' San Diego-Area Congressman Darrell Issa Is Facing a Telling
Post-Sept. 11 Political Dilemma: 'So Who Am I?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>Faye Fiore is a Times staff writer based in Washington,
D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darrell Isa is stuck in his silver Lxus on the rain-slicked streets
of Washington, D.C., an hour late. A crowd has gathered around
vegetarian grape leaves and pumpkin-filled kebabs at the Egyptian
embassy, waiting to hear a few words from the distinguished gentleman
from California. He is one of the lone Arab American voices in a
decidedly pro-Israel Congress, a 48-year-old car alarm millionaire
who never held public office before he was sworn in 20 months ago as
the Republican from Vista. He has no seniority and therefore no
clout--49th most junior congressman in California's delegation of 52.
But his Lebanese lineage makes him one of a half-dozen Arab Americans
in Congress, one of the most politically powerful members of a
politically powerless minority.</LD>
<LD>   It is an odd mantle for a kid who grew up in the Jewish section of
Cleveland Heights, down the street from the Taylor Road Synagogue. He
knows more words of Yiddish than Arabic. His Boy Scout troop observed
Saturday services on camping trips. So Arab-in-Residence is not the
job Issa envisioned two years ago when he made a run at the House of
Representatives, campaigning as a loyal law-and-order conservative,
not a Lebanese Christian.</LD>
<TE>   But the evils of Sept. 11 had a way of remapping everyone's
destiny. In Issa's case, it gave him an identity he never asked for.
The handsome lawmaker, dark-haired and swarthy-complexioned, found
himself barred from an Air France flight to the Middle East after 19
hijackers with similar dark hair and swarthy complexions made racial
profiling a national pastime. Weeks later, his district office on the
fringes of peaceful San Diego turned up as a target in an alleged
bomb plot by the radical Jewish Defense League. The Arab American
community, desperate for sympathetic ears in high places, is courting
him mightily to champion its cause. They crave a lawmaker who knows
what it feels like to be viewed suspiciously by passengers on an
airline flight.</TE>
<TE>   So Issa assumes he is headed for welcoming arms as he drives in a
warm rain this June night to a reception hosted by the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. He thinks he is going to get some sort
of award. Instead, he gets a grilling.</TE>
<TE>   "Arabs are being attacked, isn't now the time for legislation more
than ever?" demands Ban Al-Wardi, a young Los Angeles attorney
disappointed in the congressman's refusal to press for laws against
Arab hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, if not for the leadership of the president, the
American people might be willing to lock up Arabs the way they did
the Japanese," Issa responds with tepid restraint, sounding more like
a dispassionate pundit than a man who has felt the sting of ethnic
prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman is exasperated. Where is his outrage? Her friends
and family endorsed Issa's candidacy, brought him into their homes
for fund-raisers and meet-and-greets, figuring they had found a
comrade in the fight for Arab justice. In Arabic, after all, "Issa"
means "Jesus"--but from his perch in Washington, he has hardly acted
the role of savior. "A lot of people in California supported him
because he made himself out to be a leader for the Arab American
community. But he is not willing to be a leader," she later fumes.
"It's sad. The only difference he has made is a negative difference."</TE>
<TE>   Issa pops open a Diet Pepsi and moves on to the next gaggle of
guests. Every fourth person in the room seems somehow disappointed
that his thinking is not "more Arab." If you didn't know it from his
roots, they complain, you wouldn't know it from his record.</TE>
<TE>   But to call Issa Arab American seems a stretch of the ethnic
imagination. It's a label that even he questions. He likes to think
of himself as an honest broker, not a standard-bearer. Whatever Jesse
Jackson is to black Americans, whatever Cesar Chavez was to Latinos,
Darrell Issa will never be to his Arab American brethren. He is
working inside Washington, and that is not how inside Washington
works. The watchwords there are capitulation and compromise. The
freshman creed: lay low, don't do anything stupid, get yourself
reelected.</TE>
<TE>   But after the terror attacks, Issa found himself with a surname
that opened doors in the Middle East. Perhaps it was freshman naivete
or an ego swollen by corporate success that led him to believe he
could make a difference, but he decided his calling was to help
broker peace in the Middle East. His only credentials were the
accident of his ethnicity and the neighborhood in which he happened
to grow up. Sympathetic to two intractable sides, he took the middle
ground. The result: The Arab camp is consistently disappointed that
he's not more bullish; the Israeli camp is consistently surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think he sold out," says Ziad J. Asali, president of
the anti-discrimination committee. "But Darrell is a freshman
congressman with a tiny margin of power ... He has to take a position
more in the mainstream and less to the liking of this one Arab
American constituency that wants 100% support on every position that
comes along. I can't blame him for that."</TE>
<TE>   Issa has traveled to the Middle East three times since Sept. 11,
the first time in a display of ecumenical brotherhood with Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Jewish Democrat from Florida. He has watched
television with Yasser Arafat at the Ramallah compound. He was the
first U.S. lawmaker to meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad,
establishing a diplomatic dialogue with Congress where none had
existed. And in June, he made small talk with Ariel Sharon at the
Capitol, posing for a picture that he promptly framed and displayed
on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, that is remarkable access for a first-term
lawmaker. But his impartial stand in a divisive conflict isn't
winning him many friends. When the House Republican leadership
pressed in May for a resolution of solidarity with Israel, Issa voted
yes--then spent a half-hour on the floor lamenting the measure's
failure to acknowledge the other side. Afterward, he caught it from
every direction. Phone calls and letters poured in from Arabs who
said he'd caved. A pro-Israel group descended on his office in
protest, presuming he had voted against it rather than for it.</TE>
<TE>   "People assume if you're an Arab American you must think a certain
way," Issa says later in his cramped office, preparing for a morning
meeting with Sharon that ultimately will be dashed by another suicide
bombing. "Well, I'm an Arab American who grew up delivering poultry
for a rabbi. So who am I?"</TE>
<TE>   The screensaver on one of the computers in Issa's office is a
picture of the brick English Tudor on Antisdale Road where he grew up
with five siblings, his mother's 1967 Ford Fairlane parked in the
driveway. Cleveland Heights was a union town of steel and rubber. The
schools were good and the laws strict--no pickups parked on the
street, no restaurants that served take-out. His mother took the
children to a Mormon church while his father waited in the car,
drinking coffee and smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Issa's grandparents had emigrated from Lebanon and he learned a
few words of Arabic--mostly phrases such as, "God bless you." But the
greater ethnic presence was outside his front door, where half the
neighborhood was Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   It was a nice place to grow up, though it required his father to
work two full-time jobs--as a truck salesman and X-ray technician. He
died of a stroke at age 50. "Money was always a problem in our
family," Issa recalls. "Being one of the eldest, you knew there was
no way the family could support a college career. My paper route
wasn't just for giggles and pocket change. I had to figure out how to
pay for college."</TE>
<TE>   If Issa is embracing his Lebanese heritage now, it comes after
years of distancing himself from his working-class past. As a
teenager, he was indicted with his older brother on charges of
stealing a red Maserati from a car dealership; he denied the charge
and the case ultimately was dismissed. On his 17th birthday, he
dropped out of high school to join the Army. He left 10 years later
with an engineering degree and headed for the private sector,
scrambling for a leg up in the competitive auto-security business. An
apparent arson fire tore through his manufacturing plant in 1982,
weeks after the insurance coverage was increased. That aroused
suspicion, but no charges were ever filed.</TE>
<TE>   Issa went on to make millions, inventing anti-theft gadgets for
cars with menacing names such as Viper, Python and Wasp. His firm,
Directed Electronics Inc., was thriving. So with the blessing of the
company's co-founder--Kathy, his wife of 22 years--Issa turned his
attention to politics and a 1998 bid for the U.S. Senate. A rough
primary and late revelations about his somewhat checkered past helped
sink him.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, though, Issa was on his way to Congress. Indeed,
if he has a gift for anything it is for sizing up a problem and
finding a solution, whether it be rising above meager beginnings or
taking apart a sluggish laptop. Once he fixed a photocopier after the
repairman gave up. When a cell phone company told him no charger yet
made could work in the house and car, he invented one. He has 36
patents, most of which hang on the walls of his office.</TE>
<TE>   His tenacity is matched only by his energy. Operating on little
sleep, he recently visited four Arab states in three days. During a
campaign stop at an Armenian anniversary celebration in Fresno years
ago, he got carried away and did a cartwheel on the dance floor.
Maybe it's all the Diet Pepsi--his secretary says he drinks so many a
transfusion might be more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   That this resourceful businessman is now enmeshed in the
unfamiliar world of international politics is less the work of design
than fate. He came ready to lend his expertise to his country, was
denied a seat on the prestigious Commerce Committee, and sat on
International Relations in relative obscurity. Until that terrible
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Like most politicians, Issa is driven by a desire to be noticed on
the world stage, a pipedream for a freshman congressman from San
Diego County. But 9/11 gave him the opportunity and his surname gave
him the access. Now, one year later, he is engaged in international
diplomacy at the highest levels--not the knee-jerk conservative some
expected, nor the down-the-line party loyalist Republican House
leaders were counting on. Challenging the GOP's long-standing
fidelity to Israel, Issa suggests his party is "playing to a
single-minded attempt to move Jewish voters over to the Republican
column." An ultra-conservative Internet columnist has dubbed him
"Jihad Darrell."</TE>
<TE>   While some activists think he's too quick to compromise, many
experts see in Issa a maturing politician who foregoes grandstanding
for incremental progress. "He's not so much bold as responsible,"
says George Cody, executive director of the American Task Force For
Lebanon. "He raises the right questions at committee hearings. He
doesn't speak to the Arab side or the Israeli side ... But I don't
think he holds his finger to the wind or follows his leadership lock,
stock and barrel. For that he deserves credit."</TE>
<TE>   But Issa also is a novice, with a reputation for brashness and
poorly chosen words. He once called then-President Clinton "a slut."
He comes out with phrases such as, "A lot of my best friends are
Jewish," although the proclamation seems more a point of pride than
veiled intolerance. He admits his religious history is less likely to
come from the Torah than the "Old Testament for Dummies." But many
leaders in the Arab American community appreciate Issa's knowledge of
the region and its culture, which enables him to move easily in a
sometimes misunderstood world.</TE>
<TE>   "The stars are aligned for peace," Issa insists, noting that all
of the Arab League states agreed at the Beirut summit in March to
Israel's existence along pre-1967 war borders, a massive shift in
mind-set for states that spent more than 50 years challenging
Israel's right to exist. He knows people say he's naive, particularly
in light of the recent violence, but he believes peace is inevitable.
After all, the Hundred Years' War ended, even if it took 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   So he presses his colleagues to reject proposed sanctions against
states such as Syria and the PLO, and build on progress with more
dialogue. He recently spent two hours drinking tea with Syria's
Assad, and handed him a personal letter urging a more progressive
course than his late father's. The new president read the letter,
folded it carefully and put it in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   In the vast diplomatic machinery struggling to settle the
conflict, Issa's role is relatively small, yet not without some
political risk. Congress' heart belongs to Israel, and those who
defend the Arab view risk the wrath of a powerful Jewish lobby. Rep.
Earl F. Hilliard, a five-term Democrat, lost his Alabama primary in a
June runoff after Jewish supporters threw their votes to an opponent
they perceived to be more sympathetic to Israel. Fellow incumbent
Democrat Cynthia McKinney, who faced a similarly tough challenge in
Georgia in August, was virtually the only lawmaker spotted at a
recent pro-Palestinian rally in Washington, while a demonstration for
Israel drew a parade of congressional stars.</TE>
<TE>   Issa's solidly Republican San Diego-area district--with no
significant Arab American constituency--gives him job security as
long as he pays attention to local issues. (Indeed, it was a meeting
with some of the Southern California developers who nurtured him
politically that made him late for the Egyptian embassy bash.) But if
he aspires to another run for Senate--which many deem likely--his
credentials as Congress' "go-to Arab" can only harm him in a match
against incumbent Barbara Boxer--a Jewish Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I've done on this issue is counter to being a good
thing to do if you simply want to be politically popular," Issa
concedes. "There are rules here: Take a trip to Israel and put your
hand on the Wailing Wall, don't take any new positions and don't try
to move the debate. Anyone will tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   So why do it? Some people say it's ego--he needs to be a player
and thinks he has ideas. Who else would spend a record $9 million of
his own money on a pie-in-the-sky run for the U.S. Senate? Maybe it's
a sense of duty--access and opportunity fell into his lap and shame
on anyone who fails to seize it.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's like the photocopier. It's sitting there broken and
no one else seems to be able to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   his 3 o'clock appointment is on the other side of the Capitol.
Most members take the sleek electric subway across campus. Not Issa.
True to his car-worshipping California roots, he heads for the
garage. There in a front-row space sits his beloved Lexus. With its
master still 20 paces away, the car starts up, Harry Potter-style.
The air conditioner is humming by the time he gets in. He punches in
his destination--Hart Senate Office Building--and a soothing female
voice on the navigational system instructs: "Turn left at the first
light.... "</TE>
<TE>   "This," Issa proudly explains, "is what got me here."</TE>
<TE>   His fortune was born of his passions--cars and gadgets, like the
little button on his key chain that starts the engine from a block
away. So far in his life, there haven't been too many obstacles he
couldn't outwit. But this latest one is a whopper. Very un-Issa-like,
he begins with modest goals. "It's a very small role I play," he says
of his Middle East efforts. "When I go into the region, I am
educating members of Congress one by one, two by two, helping them
understand there is opportunity there. And every time you have a
visit where leaders there understand a little bit more about our
Congress, it makes it easier for them to accept some of the things we
might do without taking offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be an out-of-the-box thinker and there have to be some
solutions. I may not be the one who comes up with them, but seeing
what is possible, talking to as many people on all sides of the
issue, maybe I can help move the process that will lead to peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Lexus glides into the Hart driveway.</TE>
<TE>   "Very nice car, sir," the guard coos.</TE>
<TE>   Issa pulls into the parking space, another gadget guiding him
along so he doesn't bump the curb.</TE>
<TE>   Beep, beep, beep, beeeeeeeeeeeep. A perfect landing.</TE>
<TE>   Now if only he could invent a button for peace.</TE>

<HD>Memo to Physicist Kip Thorne: Review Your Einstein and
Emerson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kip Thorne and other scientists are attempting to prove things about
the unseen that have been sensed by great thinkers such as Albert
Einstein and Ralph Waldo Emerson ("Crunch Time," by Preston Lerner,
Aug. 11).</LD>
<LD>   I would like to quote what Emerson sensed about invisible
phenomena: "It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly
learns, that beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious
intellect he is capable of a new energy ... by abandonment to the
nature of things; that beside his privacy of power as an individual
man, there is a great public power on which he can draw, by
unlocking, at all risks, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and
circulate through him; then he is caught up into the life of the
Universe."</LD>
<LD>   It will be interesting to learn if the gravitational project is
successful, but it is far more rewarding to sense what Emerson knew
intuitively. His understanding of ourselves as inseparable from the
universe is happiness itself; and like this universe, it might be
beyond our ability to prove. Seeking knowledge without intuitive
understanding is a little like eating an orange peel and throwing
away the fruit.</LD>

<HD>A 'Dysfunctional' Kitchen?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Architect Scott Johnson's kitchen design [for his home] is not only
"unconventional" but also dysfunctional ("Down to Earth," by Michael
Webb, Style, Aug. 11). The storage area for dishes requires bending
to get or put them away, and they do not appear to be near the
dishwasher. Having dishes so near the floor where they can catch dust
when sweeping doesn't sound appetizing. They are where your knees
could knock the cups on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   The microwave also is inconveniently and awkwardly located. I
would need to get on a ladder to clean the back inside wall. And why
are the knives under the microwave and nowhere near a chopping board?
Fortunately we can't see the rest of the kitchen in the photograph.</LD>

Cucamonga ("Steelyard Blues," Aug. 4). He was less diligent in his
devotion to realism when he ignored another sense: smell.</LD>
<LD>   While living in Rancho Cucamonga before Kaiser Steel closed, we
only had a few days a year (if the wind was right) when there was an
unpleasant odor. People settle between Pomona and San Bernardino for
the quality of life here. I then moved to Fontana about the same time
that Tamco Steel was established in Rancho Cucamonga.</LD>
<LD>   Little did I know that my nose would be assaulted with the stench
from Tamco while driving to my job in Upland every night and
returning every morning. Sometimes I liked to stop at a bagel shop on
the way home, but I soon realized it wasn't possible to use its nice
patio. For 22 years I cursed Tamco and rolled up my windows
reluctantly. I retired four years ago, and now avoid the area in the
early morning and late evening for a three-mile radius.</LD>

<HD>Modernist Oasis</HD>
<DH>A Visionary Developer's '60s Haven Still Nestles in the
Hollywood Hills</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Around a narrow curve up a steep Bronson Canyon byway, gleaming
pyramids beckon from the hillside like a vision in the desert on a
sweltering day. The blues and golds shine from the faux Byzantine
mosaic sign heralding the entrance to a forgotten piece of L.A.'s
modernist heritage--the secluded little subdivision known as
Hollywood Oasis.</LD>
<LD>   The Oasis doesn't showcase bravura design on the order of artistes
such as Richard Neutra or Rudolph Schindler. But the nearly three
dozen homes built on Tuxedo Terrace and Bronson Hill Drive near
Griffith Park epitomized their era--think Hockney meets the Brady
Bunch house: clean geometric lines, split levels, exposed beam
ceilings, 30-foot-high-rock fireplaces and the occasional pool.</LD>
<TE>   The enclave was the brainchild of flamboyant entrepreneur Russ
Vincent, who was a producer and actor before turning his flair for
showmanship to real estate development. During the '60s, Vincent was
the moving force behind deliciously idiosyncratic developments such
as Laurel Canyon's classical Greece-inspired Mt. Olympus. When he
launched Hollywood Oasis in the late '50s, Vincent envisioned his
first real estate venture as a suburban retreat minutes from the
glitz of Hollywood. "We're only five minutes from Hollywood and Vine,
but we still get all the great wildlife from Griffith Park," says
Noel Toy Young, an Oasis homeowner and retired real estate agent who
worked for Vincent for nearly a decade. Vincent bought the land from
Gwendolyn Caldwell, a resident of the nearby Los Feliz Oaks district,
according to neighborhood historian James Howard Cremin, a retired
doctor who interviewed Caldwell for his homeowners association
archives.</TE>
<TE>   Among the first fixtures was the cheeky little "Hollywood Oasis"
sign decorated with palm trees and pyramids. (Vincent appears to have
been fond of over-the-top signage. The Grecian Mt. Olympus sign is a
Laurel Canyon beacon; outraged Olympians quashed an attempt by a few
poor sports several years ago to raze the sign for tackiness.) The
Oasis sign was soiled and obscured by brush until recently, when
neighborhood residents Ted Fortier and George Alpern mounted a
restoration effort.</TE>
<TE>   Upon its completion in the early '60s, Hollywood Oasis was
marketed as a deluxe development. Ever the producer, Vincent insisted
on underground utilities to prevent unsightly overhead wiring, and
many units featured a sky-lit atrium. But the houses were built with
middle-class families in mind, says Young, who purchased her
1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath residence for $55,000 in
1961. A selling point for some of the homes were amazing views
stretching to the ocean. To maximize viewing potential, kitchens and
living rooms were often on the second floor, bedrooms on the first.</TE>
<TE>   Today only a handful of original owners still live in the
subdivision, prices are in the hundreds of thousands and a few newer
residents have "mansionized" their aeries. Thus far architectural
preservationists aren't exactly making a fuss, but it might be a
different story if Vincent were still around. "He would not have been
happy with all the changes," Young says, citing the long list of
now-defunct covenants, conditions and restrictions aimed at
maintaining the ambience of the Oasis. "I don't think he would've
liked anybody messing with his big plans."</TE>

<LD>INVITED TO: Grand opening of the Airstream Diner in Beverly Hills
with performances by Daniel Lanois and Devo.</LD>
<LD>   GO WEST, YOUNG HIPSTERS: "There is a Silver Lake mafia, and Fred
is the kingpin," says Donovan Leitch (here with sis Ione Skye) of the
peculiarly geographical allegiance commanded by Fred Eric, the Vida
and Fred 62 restaurateur. Sure enough, the debut of this latest Fred
venture, Airstream, a faux '60s trailer-cum-diner, has the Eastside
bohos out in force. "It's like Silver Lake invades Beverly Hills,"
says Daniel Lanois, Silver Lake resident by way of Quebec, who
performs a set of pedal steel guitar music. "You should hear what
Fred's paying me," adds the New Orleans-flavored musician and
producer of projects by Emmylou Harris and Bob Dylan . "I'm not going
to have to produce any records for years." The sole reveler hailing
from the city's breezier zones seems to be "Gilmore" guy Milo
Ventimiglia, "representing the Venice Mafia," he says, checking out
the actual Airstream trailer in the parking lot next to the stage.
The event also attracts Gina Gershon, Rosanna Arquette and Beck, who
arrives with family members in tow. "My nephew, he's obsessed with
Devo," says the Lake's favorite son, himself a longtime raider of
retro culture. "So we came down to give him a little taste."</LD>
<TE>   ARE WE NOT (OLDER) MEN? "The very first time I heard Daniel Lanois
is when I met my husband," says former "Baywatch" babe Traci Bingham,
exhibiting unimpeachably boho taste. "We're here to celebrate." The
real draw, of course, is catching a rare show by New Wave-era mutant
rockers Devo. "We're from Ohio, and Airstream is [in] Ohio, and Ohio
has more trailer parks than any other state in the nation," says
cherubic frontman Mark Mothersbaugh by way of reintroduction. "This
is a special Ohio trailer-trash rendition of a song from our first
album." The band launches into a slow and twangy version of its 1978
breakout hit, "Jocko Homo." Three songs later, they're gone. But
visions of yesteryear linger as former KROQ deejay Jim "Poorman"
Trenton takes the stage. "I was the first person out here to play
Devo on the air," he brags, then asks the crowd if they want Devo to
come out for an encore. Everyone hollers affirmatively, but the band,
like the Poorman's old radio station, seems to have left him for
good.</TE>

<HD>The Long Year of Rescue 5</HD>
<DH>Images From a Staten Island Firehouse That Lost 11 Men in
the Attacks of Sept. 11.</DH>

<AU>GARY FRIEDMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Sept. 13, my newspaper flew me to New York to cover a horror. I
didn't expect to find a family. But here I am, weeks later, standing
in a Staten Island church, an American flag rippling outside against
the brisk October sky, as friends and family remember John Bergin,
one of 11 men from the New York Fire Department's Rescue Company 5
unit who perished when the World Trade Center towers collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   The shock of those early days is behind us. Realities are now
settling in, one eulogy at a time. John Bergin, they say, was a kind
and gentle man, a caring father, a brother to fellow firefighters, an
imposing figure who seemed likely to start brawls but instead was the
guy who stopped them. His casket is empty, as will be those of eight
other Rescue 5 firefighters whose remains were never found.</LD>
<LD>   The mourners soon adjourn to the grave site, then to the
firehouse. I tag along. How many times in 32 years as a newspaper
photographer have I been to other sad events and walked away, as
journalists are supposed to do? Firemen have their codes, too. They
bond as brothers, suspicious of outsiders, especially those with
cameras who might lift the family veil. Yet when the captain arrives
at the firehouse, he extends a hand to me and says, in as many words,
''You are welcome here.''</LD>
<TE>   Bergin's good friend Jerry Koenig begins to speak, to recall how
the two of them came to the fire company at the same time and
developed a close friendship. Koenig felt that Bergin was truly like
a brother, one with whom he never argued. "I feel him feeling worse
for us down here, suffering for our loss, and I get the feeling we'll
know we will be together again. They are smiling down on us and
they'll tell us not to worry about us, and we'll see them soon."</TE>
<TE>   During the months ahead, I return to this family of Rescue 5 as
often as I can--hanging out in the firehouse kitchen, talking to
widows and children, riding the rescue rig to "the pile'' for more
searching, joining them at an Italian restaurant as they salute the
fallen on the day the World Trade Center recovery officially ends.
Each time they let me in, they embrace me. My walls of detachment
come crashing down.</TE>
<TE>   As the days tick past, I see them move forward, every day becoming
a little easier. Joe Esposito zings me with faux insults, his way of
warming up. He lost a brother and a cousin on Sept. 11. Firefighter
Bill Spade is flown to Pasadena for honors in the Rose Parade, and
six months later to Fargo, N.D., to serve as grand marshal of the
city's July 4 parade. He is the only surviving man among the 12 from
Rescue 5 who reached the towers that day. He is starting to smile
again.</TE>
<TE>   For my part, I have grown to love 11 men I never met--and their
brothers who took me into their family. Sometime in late October, a
plaque honoring the dead will be unveiled at the firehouse. I hope to
make one last photograph.</TE>

11, working a side job. He raced to the station, where his father
told him that his brother Michael, assigned to a firefighting unit
elsewhere, had also responded. Two hours after making his way to the
site, Esposito learned that his brother was missing. His partial
remains would be identified through DNA testing in the spring. A
cousin of Esposito's was also among the 343 firefighters who died.

11. When the attack began, he and other firefighters were eating
breakfast at the firehouse. The rescue truck was at a nearby
hospital. Rather than wait for it, Spade left alone in a small
equipment truck. The bigger truck picked up the other firefighters

<LD>If the name Bradley Ogden doesn't ring a bell, it should. Back in the
early '80s, when he'd just moved to San Francisco from the Midwest,
the formidably talented young chef blew the socks off hotel dining in
the Bay Area when he inaugurated the restaurant in Campton Place
Hotel. Ogden had just completed a 4 1/2-year stint as chef at the
American Restaurant in Kansas City, and his cooking was unabashedly
American. The best meal? Breakfast. Indulgent yet not stuffy, Campton
Place Restaurant reeled in foodies from all over the country with the
promise of Ogden's updated breakfast classics.</LD>
<TE>   In 1989 he opened the Lark Creek Inn, a ferry ride away in Marin
County, then One Market Restaurant at the foot of Market Street.
Ogden soon had four restaurants, but as his projects grew, the
quality sometimes suffered. It's not unusual, but disappointing from
someone with such solid credentials.That's why when I heard that
Ogden had ventured south to open a restaurant in the San Diego
Marriott Del Mar, I didn't rush to what I envisioned as another
mid-level hotel restaurant. I hate to admit it, but it took a friend
visiting San Diego to get me there for the first time. He asked me
where to eat and I floated the idea of Arterra. He was dubious
because he hadn't been impressed with Ogden's restaurants lately.
Then I let drop that Chino Farms--a family outfit that sets the gold
standard for organic produce--had told me the chef at Arterra buys
produce from them--and not just a token hundred dollars' worth. Lots.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, I'm glad I offered to join my friend at Arterra. Ogden
is a co-owner, and under chef Carl Schroeder, his protege at Lark
Creek Inn, the kitchen is turning out seasonal cooking that defines
California cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Marriott Del Mar is not in an ideal location--a
business park on the other side of the freeway from the beach. Though
decorated within an inch of hipster kitsch, it needs something as a
draw and apparently decided the restaurant is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky for us. The spacious dining room has an upbeat color scheme
of gold, orange and purple accented by glass sconces that look like
melted blueberry parfait. Add a big splashy bar, a catchy soundtrack,
and it's Le Cirque heads for the suburbs. The curtains are a jolt of
red with gold polka dots, perhaps to distract diners from the absence
of a view. You won't notice once the first dish arrives: you'll be
looking at your plate .</TE>
<TE>   To start things off, the kitchen may send out a small glass of
golden watermelon "consomme" with a wedge of lime. In cherry season,
seared foie gras is paired with dark Montmorency cherries and
brioche, set off by a restrained sauce. Though the menu changes
frequently, you might find a lovely salad of red Sensation pears and
Chino Farms lettuces served with a cloud of Gorgonzola souffle.</TE>
<TE>   A summer menu featured an heirloom tomato salad strewn with fresh
corn kernels, and tomatoes--red, gold, green--with flavors as deep as
they come. This is the real deal, with a round of goat cheese rolled
in bread crumbs and spices for contrast. Melon and prosciutto is a
gorgeous stack of green and orange melon on mellow Parma ham, a
combination surely made in heaven. There's a richly flavored sweet
corn soup, too, swirled with cream and violet chive blossoms topped
with Dungeness crab hash. A dozen Hama Hamas from British Columbia,
crisp and cold, came on a cast-glass platter filled with ice and are
some of the best oysters I've had--ever.</TE>
<TE>   For Schroeder, this has to be a dream job. It comes with Ogden, a
built-in mentor of some stature; he has the chance to work with the
best products; and the pace is never punishing.</TE>
<TE>   Guinea hen appears as delicious thick slices rimmed with crisp
skin set on wild mushrooms and gnocchi. A light, delicate smoke
permeates alderwood-smoked duck breast, giving the meat an exotic
edge. Wild salmon with baby turnips is in a gossamer shellfish and
saffron sauce. As fine as the roast pork loin is (and the incredibly
sweet corn that accompanies it), vegetarians have the edge at
Arterra. The kitchen puts a huge amount of work into the vegetarian
entree. Most recently it consisted of a watercress soup, a tomatoes
and buffalo mozzarella salad and a "personal tart"--don't you love
that expression?--of goat cheese and more of those luscious heirloom
tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   The young staff has caught the excitement of the kitchen. From the
way they explain the food or the wine, you can see how hard they're
trying to do something here in San Diego County. The sommelier will
ask how cold you'd like your wine. In his refrigerator white wines
are kept at three temperatures--one for Chardonnay, one for Sauvignon
Blanc and other whites, and one for Champagnes. The wine list is no
slouch either. Wine director Matthew Andrews has put together a
respectable all-American list, which is as strong on Oregon and
Washington as it is on California selections.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, there's a deconstructed ice cream sundae--a scoop of
ice cream in a lacey chocolate cage, and balls of ice cream rolled in
nuts or chocolate nibs. It's as hard keeping this one to yourself as
the berry sampler, which includes a miniature strawberry shortcake, a
blueberry cobbler and a boysenberry float.</TE>
<TE>   San Diegans must not be into breakfast the way San Franciscans
are, with their foggy mornings. Arterra's breakfast menu seems small,
but even the basics are made with top products. House-smoked salmon
comes with a toasted bagel, cream cheese, capers and sliced red
onion--and tomato. To Schroeder's credit, if he puts a tomato on the
plate, it's red. The fluffy tangerine souffle cake is decorated with
blood orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit segments. And while I
love the idea of buttermilk blueberry pancakes, the breakfast cook
seems to carry the idea of al dente too far. Pancakes are underdone,
toast pale.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Del Mar racetrack season is in full swing, I'm hoping
Arterra will be busier. A kitchen like this one deserves to succeed.
It's a smart menu: lighthearted cuisine for a hotel restaurant that
is taking dining seriously.</TE>

<LD>When hiking on your favorite trail, do you stop to wonder who
arranged those rock slabs into perfect steps? Or who moved those
fallen trees off to the side? Or who built the footbridge across that
muddy creek?</LD>
<LD>   While many trails were originally built by Franklin Delano
Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration, today's good deeds are
being done by average Joes who participate in one of the American
Hiking Society's many trail maintenance projects. AHS' programs
aren't free, but what you pay is nominal. One-or two-week working
vacations in the woods cost $80 for members and $100 for nonmembers.
The fee is used in several ways: It may pay for building materials
and tools, accommodations (usually a campsite, and you bring your own
tent), food and transportation to the site.</LD>
<LD>   As with all of AHS' programs, you'll be in the woods each morning
working. After work, you'll have several hours of daylight at your
leisure, although you might also be expected to help out with some of
the chores, like cooking, collecting firewood and cleaning dishes at
camp.</LD>
<TE>   Although the most popular season for AHS' programs is summer--and
a few of this fall's more alluring programs (such as at Montana's
amazing Glacier National Park in early September) are already
full--there are still plenty of places up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a program is offered in Massachusetts in
mid-October, the peak foliage season for this part of New England.
Over a week, the crew will repair (in some cases wholly rebuild)
footbridges around Buffumville Lake, which is about 50 miles west of
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   During off time, the same volunteers can canoe, hike, mountain
bike, go fishing or simply hang out in the fresh air. Food is
included, and free transportation is available to and from Boston's
Logan Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Some other interesting volunteer opportunities elsewhere in the
country:</TE>
<TE>   * Near the stunning White Sands National Monument in southern New
Mexico, volunteers will build steps, install signs and do general
repair work to the 4 1/2-mile-long Pine Tree Trail. Food is provided,
as is transportation to and from El Paso Airport. UFO sightings are
not guaranteed. Work will be underway from Oct. 6 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   * At South Cumberland State Park in Tennessee, 10 volunteers will
remove dead trees, cut back summer growth and do general rehab work
to the trail system from Nov. 3 to 9. Food is provided. There are
caves, cliffs and waterfalls to explore after the workday is over.</TE>
<TE>   * In the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, a team will
construct trail switchbacks and reroute a trail from Sept. 15 to 21.
Transportation to and from Buffalo airport is provided, as is food
for the week. There's no need for tents on this program: The group
stays in cabins inside the park.</TE>
<TE>   If this fall is out of the question, you might plan ahead for next
summer, when hundreds of volunteer vacations all over the country
will be offered.</TE>
<TE>   A representative at the American Hiking Society tells us that its
Web site, www.americanhiking.org, which lists all the volunteer
vacations and whether there are spots still available, is updated
regularly. Signing up is as easy as downloading an application form
from the Web and mailing it in with your payment. If you have
questions or concerns, call (301) 565-6704, Ext. 206.</TE>

<HD>Celebrity's Summit Veers Toward Hawaii, Canal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When ships reposition from Alaska to the Caribbean, some make a side
trip to Hawaii for a couple of sailings before transiting the Panama
Canal back to Florida. One of the prettiest of the big new ships
offering Hawaii and canal cruises is the Summit from Celebrity
Cruises, a line noted for outstanding cuisine and shipboard comfort.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,950-passenger, 91,000-ton Summit, third in the line's
Millennium-class ships, made its debut in October and spent its
maiden season cruising Alaska. On Sept. 16, the ship will sail from
Vancouver, Canada, to Honolulu on an 11-night itinerary that includes
five days at sea and visits to four popular island
ports--Kailua-Kona, Hilo, Lahaina and Nawiliwili--before arriving in
Honolulu Sept. 24.</LD>
<LD>   The ship will depart from Honolulu the same day and will visit the
same island ports as on the Sept. 16 itinerary before continuing
across the Pacific to Ensenada, Mexico, arriving Oct. 4. (Ensenada is
the disembarkation port for passengers, who will be taken by bus to
San Diego.)</LD>
<TE>   Passengers on the Panama Canal transit will sail from San Diego on
Oct. 4 and visit Cabo San Lucas and Acapulco, Mexico; Puerto Caldera,
Costa Rica; Cartagena, Colombia; and Oranjestad, Aruba, on the way to
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where they arrive Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Some early-booking fares start as low as $1,199 per person, double
occupancy, for an inside (windowless) double stateroom on the
10-night Vancouver-to-Hawaii sailing. Starting fares with
early-booking discounts on the 11-night Hawaii-to-Ensenada cruise are
$1,299 per person, double occupancy, and on the 14-night transcanal
cruise from San Diego to Fort Lauderdale are $1,699 and higher per
person, double occupancy.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest-priced inside cabins measure 170 square feet, with two
lower beds that can be combined into a queen-size bed, along with
sitting area (some cabins offer a sofa bed as well), spacious closet
and bathroom with shower. Some outside cabins also measure 170 square
feet and open onto a 38-square-foot private veranda with lounge
chairs and table. Prices for those begin at $2,399 with early-booking
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Top-of-the-line suites range from 251 square feet with a
57-square-foot veranda to the penthouse suite, which measures 1,432
square feet with a 1,098-square-foot veranda. All suites come with
computer, printer, Internet access and personalized stationery. Other
perks include in-suite massages, a portrait sitting and free use of
the spa's thalassic therapy pool. A butler will deliver full
breakfast, lunch and dinner at your request. Prices range from $2,899
to $15,599 per person, double. Optional air fare packages are
available.</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia buffs will enjoy the classic Normandie Restaurant,
decorated with period photographs of the 1935 ship that burned and
sank in New York Harbor in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   For a $25 surcharge, the elegant restaurant offers flawless
service and a menu created by Michelin Guide three-star chef Michel
Roux, who oversees the menus and food preparation for Celebrity. To
dine in the Normandie, you'll need reservations and dressy clothes.
Men are expected to wear a jacket every night, or a suit and tie or
tuxedo on formal nights. No children younger than 12 are permitted. A
glass-walled demonstration kitchen enables diners to see some of the
meal preparation.</TE>
<TE>   The multilevel Cosmopolitan dining room, with its wall of windows
facing the sea, is glamorous at breakfast, lunch or dinner. But
breakfast and lunch, afternoon pizza and frozen yogurt, and
late-night meals are available in the Waterfall Cafe for those who
prefer a casual buffet. On deck, the Waterfall Grill serves hot dogs
and hamburgers at lunchtime, and there's 24-hour cabin service.</TE>
<TE>   On the lower decks you'll find a cinema and conference center,
champagne bar, Michael's Cigar Club, Fortunes Casino and Celebrity
Online with 20 or so terminals for Internet connections. On the upper
decks among the cabins is a two-deck reading library called Words and
a separate two-deck music room called Notes.</TE>
<TE>   The huge Elemis AquaSpa includes a spa pool with a retractable
glass roof, a thalassic therapy center, a fitness center with
floor-to-ceiling windows, treatment rooms that offer facials,
four-hand massages (two therapists working in unison) and exotic
beauty rituals. All-day spa and beauty packages can be ordered before
sailing.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment aboard is splashy, thanks to the modern technical
facilities in the three-deck theater and a company of 16 singers,
dancers and entertainers who present two production shows a week as
well as welcome-aboard and variety entertainment.</TE>

<HD>Resort Opens on Eastern Shore of Maryland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maryland's scenic Eastern Shore, known for fishing, farming and
waterfowl hunting, got its first big destination resort hotel last
week--with a grandiose name to match. The $155-million Hyatt Regency
Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa and Marina, is along the Choptank
River in Cambridge, about 35 miles southeast of Annapolis, Md. It
offers travelers an alternative to the rural B&amp;Bs and highway chain
hotels that form the bulk of the region's lodging.</LD>
<LD>   The resort has 400 guest rooms; an 18,000-square-foot
European-style spa with 14 treatment rooms; four swimming pools,
including one with water slides; a fitness center and studio offering
yoga and aerobics classes; and a 150-slip marina offering sailing
lessons, canoe and kayak rentals and fishing expeditions. The hotel
complex is 16 miles upriver from the Chesapeake Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Still to open are an 18-hole golf course (by the end of this
month), one of the four restaurants (the Blue Point Provision Co., in
April) and facilities for overnight boat stays at the marina (in
April), a spokeswoman said last week.</LD>
<TE>   Construction delays postponed the resort's opening several times.
Many in the area are hoping the development will help revive the
local economy, which has suffered from high unemployment and a
decline in its manufacturing base.</TE>
<TE>   The introductory room rate, through Nov. 30, is $149. (800)

<HD>Sheraton to Compensate Guests for Glitches</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Complaints about your hotel stay? It's not unusual for hoteliers to
discount your room rate or even give you a free night in egregious
cases. But now a major chain, Sheraton Hotels, is setting up a system
for such compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Under a policy called Sheraton Service Promise, to begin Friday,
the company will offer credits, free services or points in its
frequent-guest program based on customers' level of complaint.</LD>
<LD>   What the company calls an "inconvenience," such as missing bath
amenities or slow check-in, could earn a $15 credit on services or
room rates, or 500 Starwood Preferred Guest Points. A "large problem
that cannot be fixed," such as uncontrollable noise or not getting
the room type you were guaranteed, could earn a free night or a cash
refund for the affected night.</LD>
<TE>   The chain said the policy is designed to "restore confidence ...
in the Sheraton brand among both consumers and employees."</TE>

beverages must be sealed and put through the X-ray screening machine.
An open can of soda won't be allowed through a checkpoint, but a
bottle of soda with a top that can be sealed will be, officials
said.... Park One, a privately owned parking lot at 6351 W. Century

<HD>Lakes Mead, Powell Remain Open Even Through Drought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drought-induced drops in the water levels of Lake Mead in Arizona and
Nevada and Lake Powell in Arizona and Utah are keeping the National
Park Service and concessionaires busy hauling away silt, relocating
anchor points--and trying to correct what they say are misleading
reports on lake conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Further decreases are expected this month as parts of the West
cope with a record drought.</LD>
<LD>   "There's plenty of water to boat on," Kay Rohde, spokeswoman for
the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, said last week. "You just
have to watch the hazards." Rock formations are closer to the surface
now in some areas, park officials said.</LD>
<TE>   At the Las Vegas Bay Marina, the closest one on Lake Mead to the
gambling city, boat rentals have been down at least 25% this summer
compared with 2001, manager Gail Kaiser said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people have called from California and said, 'We heard the
lake was closed,' " Kaiser added.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, although the Government Wash and Pearce Ferry launch
ramps were closed earlier this year, eight others remained open last
week, Rohde said. For updates, call (702) 293-8907 or visit
www.nps.gov/lame/lowwater.html.</TE>
<TE>   At Lake Powell, all launch ramps were open last week, said
Marianne Karraker, spokeswoman at Glen Canyon National Recreation
Area. Some boat routes have been changed to avoid hazards, she added.
For updates, call the Carl Hayden Visitor Center, (928) 608-6404.</TE>
<TE>   The water level at Lake Powell has dropped about 38 feet in the
last year, including about 15 feet since May 28, officials said. At
current rates, the level could reach 3,618 feet by January, enough to
threaten at least two launch sites but just shy of the record 1993
low of 3,612 feet, they said.</TE>
<TE>   At Lake Mead, the water level has dropped 23 feet in a year and is
expected to lose nearly 3 more feet by the end of this month,
officials said; exact losses depend on weather.</TE>

<HD>It's Hard to Keep Up When Symptoms of Altitude Sickness
Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN DOHENY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Altitude sickness can mean misery for veteran mountain climbers and
sedentary tourists alike. The condition occurs because of reduced
atmospheric pressure, and thus reduced oxygen, at high altitudes, and
"there is no way of predicting" who will get it, says Dr. Charles
Houston, a retired professor of environmental medicine at the
University of Vermont and the author of several books on the topic.</LD>
<LD>   Acute mountain sickness, the mildest form of the disorder, can
occur after an ascent to 7,000 or 8,000 feet--or perhaps lower--and
may be accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue,
dizziness, sleeping difficulties, confusion and a staggering gait.
Acute mountain sickness does not usually cause any long-term damage,
Houston says. But experts say travelers should be aware that the
condition can strike anyone who travels to high altitudes.</LD>
<LD>   "The important factor is the altitude, not the activity," says Dr.
Kyle Howell, an emergency physician at Mammoth Hospital in Mammoth
Lakes, Calif., a ski resort at an elevation of 7,900 feet. At his
emergency department, he says, they see "a fair amount" of altitude
sickness affecting visitors.</LD>
<TE>   Some recent findings may help mountain climbers, in particular,
reduce their risk.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Japanese researchers reported that a faulty gene may
cause one type of altitude sickness that affects even strong and
healthy climbers. Researchers have long suspected a genetic
predisposition to the disorder. The researchers, from Shinshu
University School of Medicine in Matsumoto, compared 41 subjects with
a history of high altitude pulmonary edema, or HAPE, a severe form of
altitude sickness, with 51 subjects who had no such history.</TE>
<TE>   They found that those with a history of HAPE were more likely to
have variations in a gene that helps maintain lung function. None of
the control subjects tested positive for the gene variations, but
more than a quarter of the HAPE subjects had them. Researchers
concluded that these defects may help explain why some people are
susceptible. The research appeared in the online version of the
journal Circulation; to see the abstract, go to
www.circ.ahajournals.org and search by the keyword HAPE.</TE>
<TE>   Although a test showing the presence of the gene variation can't
predict with certainty that someone will always suffer altitude
sickness, the Japanese team hopes to replicate the findings in other
populations.</TE>
<TE>   Their findings apply just to HAPE, which is characterized by fluid
in the lungs, extreme fatigue, breathlessness even at rest, cough,
chest tightness and blue or gray lips and nails. But there are other
forms of altitude sickness, including high altitude cerebral edema,
or HACE, in which the brain swells and functions abnormally. A person
with HACE, which is also considered a severe form of the disorder,
may be lethargic and confused and lack coordination, resulting in a
staggering walk that makes him appear intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   Common-sense measures can reduce the risk of mountain sickness.
Climbers should ascend at a rate that lets their bodies acclimate.
It's impossible, experts say, to know just how many feet of elevation
per day or hour is wise because everyone adjusts differently.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts suggest taking acetazolamide (Diamox) before and
during the climb. It's thought to work, the manufacturer says, by
making the blood more acidic; this increases the drive to breathe,
resulting in greater oxygen intake.</TE>
<TE>   For climbers who want a more natural approach, some experts say
ginkgo biloba can also help, at least in reducing the severity of
altitude sickness if it does occur.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Dr. Janet Onopa and her colleagues from the
University of Hawaii and the Kapiolani Clinical Research Center in
Honolulu decided to test ginkgo as a preventive measure. They gave 12
climbers ginkgo (60 milligrams three times a day) and 14 climbers a
placebo. The doses started a day before rapid ascent from sea level
to nearly 14,000 feet and continued for five days.</TE>
<TE>   The ginkgo "lowered the incidence [of altitude sickness] but it
was not statistically significant," she says. Seven of the 12
climbers on ginkgo suffered mountain sickness, compared with 13 of 14
of the placebo-treated climbers.</TE>
<TE>   But the ginkgo did reduce the severity of illness once it
occurred, the Hawaiian team found. Only two of the ginkgo-treated
climbers became severely sick; nine of those treated with placebo
did.</TE>
<TE>   Houston doesn't discourage climbers who want to try ginkgo. But,
he says, "Diamox is better."</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian researchers will next compare ginkgo with Diamox.
"Our gut feeling is ginkgo is not quite as good as Diamox," Onopa
says. But, she adds, ginkgo is available over the counter, while
Diamox requires a prescription. And some climbers prefer ginkgo
because it is a "natural" remedy.</TE>
<TE>   Climbers should be alert to any symptoms of altitude sickness,
experts say. Immediate descent and medical attention are advised.
Treatment includes rest, fluids and mild pain relievers, among other
options.</TE>
<TE>   In mild cases of acute mountain sickness, Howell says, travelers
can sometimes stay at altitude and wait until they acclimate. But a
person with an underlying health problem, such as a heart or lung
disorder, may suffer more severely. Because the symptoms of mountain
sickness are often alarming, Howell cautions mountain-sick travelers
to seek medical care.</TE>

<LD>"What's the best walk to Wordsworth's cottage?" I asked at the
Information Center in Ambleside, England.</LD>
<LD>   "Take the old coffin route through woodland and across meadows to
Grasmere and Dove Cottage," responded the gentleman behind the
counter, referring to the poet's former home. "Do return by the
shores of Grasmere and Rydal lakes. It's a good way to get introduced
to the lakes in the Lake District."</LD>
<LD>   The district is a hiker's nirvana: lovely lakes surrounded by
England's most rugged mountains, all within the country's largest
national park. Information-center staff and locals are knowledgeable
about the superb network of pathways and cheerfully suggest walks
suited to visitors' interests and abilities as well as the
ever-changing weather. Inexpensive maps and guidebooks to Lake
District National Park also help.</LD>
<TE>   William Wordsworth first floated the notion of preserving the Lake
District as "national property" in the 1835 edition of his "Guide to
the Lakes." That vision became reality in 1951, when England
established the national park.</TE>
<TE>   We remember Wordsworth for his romantic poetry, but his "Guide to
the Lakes" was hugely popular in his day. The guide earned so much
attention that Wordsworth often was asked whether he had written
anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Wordsworth may have put the Lake District on the map, but it took
the addition of steamboats on the lakes to entice visitors and
expanded train service to get them there.</TE>
<TE>   The railway is still a great way to go. A four-hour train ride
takes travelers from London to Oxenholme, just outside the Lake
District, then another branch makes the half-hour trip to the town of
Windermere. I flew from Los Angeles to London, then rode a train
north, arriving for an early evening walk in the Lake District less
than 20 hours after I left LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Ice Age glaciers formed the lakes, known in this part of England
as "waters" or "meres."</TE>
<TE>   Windermere, England's largest lake, can be enjoyed by steamboat
ride or shoreline saunter.</TE>
<TE>   Some say curvy Ullswater is the district's most beautiful lake; it
inspired some of Wordsworth's most famous passages. The young poet
"wandered lonely as a cloud" and celebrated the daffodils blossoming
on the pastoral slopes above.</TE>
<TE>   Others think that Derwent Water lives up to the nickname "Queen of
the Lakes," its beauty accented by a mountain backdrop. Hikers can
make an 11-mile circuit around romantic Derwent Water; the less
intrepid can board one of the boats that circle the lake, shuttling
from dock to dock.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter hiking routes can be found at Buttermere (four miles),
Rydal Water (three miles) and Grasmere (four miles).</TE>
<TE>   One of the best tactics is to base yourself in a centrally
located, walker-friendly town such as Grasmere, Windermere or
Keswick. Step out of your lodging and take what British hikers call a
"circular walk," or plan a one-way adventure with the help of a bus
or taxi. I stayed in Ambleside, which has fabulous footpaths,
restaurants, pubs and stores with quality hiking apparel and
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Lakes aren't the only attraction of the Lake District. Jagged
peaks of volcanic rock thrust skyward from lush, deep valleys. More
than 100 summits, called "fells," exceed 2,000 feet. The views
stretch across mountain tarns (little lakes among the crags), dense
woods, tumbling streams, drowsy hamlets and the Irish Sea.</TE>
<TE>   These mountains are among the world's oldest--more ancient than
the Himalayas and the Alps. The youngest rock formations are more
than 200 million years old.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to resist the call of peaks named Cat Bells, Hay Stacks
or the Old Man of Coniston. One of the most popular peaks is
Helvellyn, the so-called Sunrise Mountain because so many ramblers
make the ascent in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Scafell, at 3,162 feet the highest point in England, is
irresistible. The peak is so popular that on some busy days, climbers
queue up to stand on the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of rocks have been put to good use in the form of
dry-stone walls--ones built without cement or mortar. These
centuries-old walls separate pastures and property lines and pattern
the hills in a lovely way, sometimes extending in ruler-straight
lines for miles. Walkers are constantly opening and closing gates and
stepping over stiles.</TE>
<TE>   Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and their contemporaries are
often credited with popularizing the sport of walking. After visiting
their homes and haunts here, one can easily understand why they
walked 15, 20 or 25 miles a day--and how they were inspired to write
such great poetry.</TE>
<TE>   For those of you who make the trip, a few tips: Expect crowds
around the major lakes during the summer, particularly on weekends.
Though paths were closed last year to prevent the spread of
foot-and-mouth disease, the livestock epidemic was declared over in
January; travel restrictions were lifted, and walkers are returning.
Fall and spring are excellent times to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Weather changes rapidly. A bright and sunny start does not
guarantee a warm and dry experience atop mountains, so dress
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Good places to research a trip are
www.cumbria-the-lake-district.co.uk and www.lake-district.gov.uk.</TE>

<HD>While Ban Is Debated, Americans Are Flocking to Cuba</HD>
<DH>There are ways to see the island without violating U.S.
government restrictions. And tour providers are numerous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every year, Congress debates whether to end the travel ban to
Cuba. But in this election year, the wrangling has been louder than
usual, involving former President Jimmy Carter, who met in May with
Fidel Castro in Cuba, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and
President Bush. (Their positions on ending four decades of sanctions
were si, si and no, respectively.)</LD>
<LD>   In July the House adopted a measure that would end restrictions on
U.S. citizens traveling to the Communist island; the Senate is
expected to take up the issue when it returns after Labor Day. Bush
has vowed to veto any end to the restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   As debate continues over the ban, scores of educational and other
groups send thousands of Americans to Cuba each year without
violating the law. Many other Americans go there individually as
journalists or in other professional capacities, which is allowed
under the ban, or to visit Cuban relatives, which is also allowed.
Licensed charter flights regularly take off for Havana from Miami,
Los Angeles and New York.</LD>
<TE>   In all, about 176,000 Americans visited Cuba last year, according
to estimates from the independent U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council in New York. At least 25,000 of them went without
authorization, the council believes; other estimates range up to
60,000.</TE>
<TE>   It is, in fact, fairly easy for Americans to go to Cuba without
skirting the law, which makes it all the more surprising that so many
go illegally, typically by detouring through a third country such as
Canada or Mexico. In doing so, they risk civil fines up to $55,000 or
even criminal penalties of up to 10 years in jail or a $250,000 fine,
according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which enforces the travel
ban through its Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, no doubt, knowingly go to Cuba illegally, aware that
enforcement of the ban is spotty. But it's easy to see how some could
break the law inadvertently because the regulations are so
convoluted. A useful summary of them, along with a list of U.S.
companies authorized to conduct tours and fly between the U.S. and
Cuba, is on OFAC's Internet site, www.treas.gov/ofac. (Click on
"Sanctions Program and Country Summaries," then select "Cuba.")</TE>
<TE>   Generally, there are two ways to travel legally to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Certain categories of people--U.S. journalists, government
employees, professionals attending conferences, researchers and
athletes--can travel as individuals or in groups, providing the visit
is related to their professions; people can also visit close
relatives in Cuba up to once a year. Such people needn't apply to
OFAC for permission to travel.</TE>
<TE>   An easier option for most Americans is to sign on to a trip
organized by an educational, religious or humanitarian group that has
obtained what's called a "specific license," granted by OFAC for
trips related to the group's purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, trips to Cuba must use "travel service providers," or
TSPs, and airlines (called "carrier service providers") licensed by
OFAC. As of July, more than 175 TSPs and more than 30 carrier service
providers were listed on the OFAC Web site. (Some companies hold both
licenses.) Most are in Florida, and most, knowledgeable observers
say, cater to Cuban Americans visiting family in Cuba. But more than
a dozen TSPs are in California.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, Cuba Travel Services Inc. of Inglewood,
(800) 963-2822, www.latocuba.com, has operated a weekly nonstop
charter flight from LAX to Havana for more than two years. Round-trip
fares begin at $650, depending on the season.</TE>
<TE>   Although some polls show that about two-thirds of Americans want
to end the Cuba travel ban, such trips remain controversial,
especially among Castro opponents. If you are considering a trip,
make sure the organizer has a current OFAC license.</TE>
<TE>   Trips come in an astonishing variety of prices and itineraries.
They typically include all food and lodging costs. (Under OFAC rules,
American visitors can spend no more than $166 a day in Havana and
$125 per day in other areas of Cuba--excluding most professional and
some other costs--and can bring back no more than $100 in Cuban
goods.)</TE>
<TE>   With Castro aging and a sense that support for sanctions is
slipping, many visitors are eager to see the island before its
isolation ends, trip operators say. Who's going to Cuba may surprise
you.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a tremendous amount of retirees who were in Cuba in the
1950s," says Marie Delorie, who runs the Cuba program for the
nonprofit Cross-Cultural Solutions in New Rochelle, N.Y. "They want
to see it while Castro is in and before McDonald's invades." Summer
trips are popular with teachers and students, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the organizing groups:</TE>
<TE>   * Global Exchange: This San Francisco-based nonprofit is known for
human-rights activism, such as its campaign two years ago to persuade
Starbucks to buy coffee beans under so-called fair-trade standards.
But it has also run a burgeoning Cuba program for 11 years. It
organizes about 60 trips a year, up from four when it began, says
program director Malia Everette. Last year it sent more than 2,000
people to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Among its many offerings is a two-week "Cuban Rhythms" program,
priced from $1,800 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip
air fare from Cancun, Mexico. The itinerary varies but typically
includes workshops in Afro-Cuban dance and music, meetings with urban
environmentalists, visits to schools and "a day for personal
exploration of Havana." There's an 11-day "Eco-Bicycling Adventure,"
from $1,600 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air
from Cancun, with visits to an organic agricultural cooperative and a
two-wheeled Havana tour. For the truly academic, there's "XX Latin
American Congress in Hydraulics" from Sept. 25 to Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Some traditional tourist pastimes, such as walking tours and
concert-going, qualify as educational activities under Global
Exchange's OFAC license, Everette says--in fact, nearly every
activity may qualify except maybe snorkeling and sunbathing, she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Occasionally we'll get someone who says, 'I just want to hang
out' on the trips," Everette says. "We tell them to be legal you need
to be in our program at least 40 hours per week." Contacts: (415)
255-7296, www.globalexchange.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Cross-Cultural Solutions: The main focus of this private
nonprofit is sending volunteers around the world for relief work and
other aid. But in the last two years it has also sent a total of
about 700 Americans to Cuba on licensed educational exchange trips,
says program manager Delorie.</TE>
<TE>   "Insight Cuba" trips depart nearly every month. The one-week
version, priced from $1,781 per person, double occupancy, excluding
air fare, typically focuses on Havana and nearby areas, with walking
tours, meetings with women's groups and social workers and some time
to "pursue individual interests." The two-week version, priced from
$2,651 per person, double occupancy, excluding air fare, takes in
more of the island, including Trinidad, Bayamo and Santiago de Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   There are also special trips, such as one to the Havana
International Jazz Festival from Dec. 11 to 18, priced from $2,631
per person, double occupancy, including air fare between Miami and
Havana. Contacts: (800) 380-4777, www.traveltocubanow.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Adventure Tours and Travel: This licensed travel service
provider, based in Pasadena, began sending Cuban Americans to the
island in 1992. Today it organizes about 15 cultural trips per year,
specializing in art and architecture for colleges, art centers and
other institutions, said Peter Sanchez, group coordinator. The
institutions market the trips.</TE>
<TE>   One client is the Long Beach City College Foundation, the
fund-raising arm of the college, which got its educational OFAC
license this summer. The group's weeklong "Discover Cuba" trip,
priced at $2,699 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip
air from LAX, departs Oct. 18. Contacts: (562) 938-4634 (ask for
Ginny Baxter), www.cubaculturaltours.com/lbcc.</TE>

<LD>The kids were waiting impatiently at the Ferris wheel, their fists
full of the candy their indulgent parents had just bought for them.</LD>
<LD>   But this was no summer day at the local theme park. We were in New
York City's Times Square, checking out the city's hottest new
attraction for junior tourists, a Toys R Us that features a
60-foot-high roller coaster, a giant Barbie house and a 5-ton
dinosaur that roars and swings its tail.</LD>
<LD>   With Toys R Us, MTV, the Disney theaters and store, theme
restaurants such as Planet Hollywood and the nearby lights of
Broadway, Times Square has become Family Central for tourists
visiting New York. Sixty-five percent of the shoppers at the Times
Square Toys R Us are out-of-towners, a company spokesman said. Some
visitors told me they made the giant toy store their first stop. (To

<TE>   Southern Californian Albert Katz, who was trying to corral his
four kids at Toys R Us, liked the bang he was getting for his
vacation buck. "Compared to a day at Disneyland, you spend less, and
there's more to do," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   This enthusiasm is good news for New York. As we near the first
anniversary of Sept. 11, the city is still struggling to encourage
tourists to return. Officials say the number of visiting families
from around the country helps offset the significant decline in
visitors from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Johnson, a minister from Richland, Wash., chose to vacation in
New York and Washington, D.C., because of Sept. 11. "We thought there
would be fewer crowds," he said with a laugh as he surveyed the
packed Toys R Us.</TE>
<TE>   Mary DeFeo, 16, persuaded her parents to bring her and a friend to
New York for her 16th birthday--their first trip to the Big Apple.</TE>
<TE>   "Shopping is their main thing," said Mary's mom, Jennifer, a Rhode
Island schoolteacher.</TE>
<TE>   One family from London was checking into the oh-so-hip W New York
Times Square, the hotel chain's flagship. The W would enthrall any
teen or preteen with its glass-encased waterfall, lounge-style lobby,
in-room DVD players and sleek stainless-steel fixtures. At the
hotel's Blue Fin restaurant, families can nibble sushi and seafood,
salads and standout desserts, without breaking the vacation budget.
The hotel offers a weekend package that includes continental
breakfast and, if available, a room upgrade. The cost is $259 a
night, a discount of about $50. Call (877) W-HOTELS (946-8357) or
visit www.whotels.com.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever your taste or budget, there are deals that can help
families stretch their vacation dollars:</TE>
<TE>   * The 115-room Gorham Hotel at 136 W. 56th St. has a complimentary
Internet connection (a hit with teens) in the lobby, free fruit and
candy, and parlor suites with a kitchen alcove. Rooms start at $205.
The bountiful buffet breakfast is a bargain at $11.50. The hotel even
provides double-and triple-seated strollers. Call (800) 735-0710 or
visit www.gorhamhotel.com.</TE>
<TE>   * The Upper East Side's Hotel Wales welcomes tiny travelers and
their parents with a $229 room that includes a crib, highchair,
fridge, baby bathtub, toys and a stroller. Call (877) 847-4444 or
visit www.boutiquehg.com.</TE>
<TE>   * The new Westin New York at Times Square, set to open in
mid-October, will offer $199 weekend rates. The hotel's Westin Kids
Club will include presents for young hotel guests, and an urban camp
program is in the works. Call (800) WESTIN-1 (937-8461) or visit
www.westinny.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Manhattan Getaways offers one-bedroom apartments starting at
$170 per night, as well as bed-and-breakfast rooms in New Yorkers'
homes. Call (212) 956-2010 or visit www.manhattangetaways.com.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a buyer's market," said Arleen Kropf of NYC &amp; Co., the
city's tourism agency. She notes that the average room price has
dropped from $230 to $187, with many available for less.</TE>
<TE>   Take the opportunity to introduce your aspiring actors and
actresses to Broadway, which is offering kid-friendly productions
like "Oklahoma," "42nd Street," "Mamma Mia," "Rent" and "The
Producers." As Broadway struggles to fill many of its theaters,
bargain tickets abound. Half-price tickets to many Broadway
productions, including "Rent" and "42nd Street," are available at the
Theatre Development Fund's TKTS kiosks at Times Square and the South
Street Seaport. There are also discount theater coupons available at
the New York City Visitor Center at 7th Avenue and 53d Street. Find
more deals or purchase tickets at www.ilovenytheater.com or
www.playbill.com.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you do when you get here, New Yorkers will try to make
you and your kids feel at home. "We even got help on the subway,"
said George Greene, a Minnesotan raised in New York.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As an Armenian American who has visited Anatolia, Turkey, I enjoyed
Susan James' article "Anatolia, Where the Past Is the Present" (Aug.
11).</LD>
<LD>   Many Armenian Americans trace their ancestry to these areas, which
were populated by Armenians for 2,500 years until 1915.</LD>
<LD>   The claim that Anatolia is an open-air museum is correct, at least
for now. The Turkish government has a terrible record of protecting
its non-Turkic antiquities.</LD>
<TE>   At the turn of the last century, there were more than 2,000
Armenian churches and antiquities in the area. According to an
article by Dickran Kouymjian of Cal State Fresno, between 1915 and
1923 about 1,000 Armenian churches and monasteries were destroyed;
many others were converted into mosques and barns, used as targets
for military practice or left to decay.</TE>
<TE>   James' article may help Turkey care for all of its historic past.</TE>

<HD>Paris' Best Under $150</HD>
<DH>Looking for decent, conveniently located small hotels in
the French capital? Inquire below.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI STROUD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>There are 75,000 hotel rooms in Paris. Finding one is not the
problem. Finding one that is well located, well appointed and
affordable, that's the problem.</LD>
<LD>   In May I took the challenge and inspected more than 100 rooms in
30 Paris hotels. (I stayed overnight in six; only four of those made
the list.) I avoided the big, impersonal business hotels and narrowed
my search to small lodgings in neighborhoods that reflect Parisian
life but also are convenient by foot to one or more of the major
attractions. By using such a hotel as a base, you can absorb the
street scene, window shop and stop for a cafe creme on your way to
bigger things.</LD>
<LD>   I further narrowed my search to hotels that would not simply
facilitate a trip to Paris but enhance it. I required clean
furnishings, private bathrooms, basic desk services and an
English-speaking desk staff. I also expected a bit of charm, a little
something extra in the way of service, convenience, comfort or decor
that in its own right would make for a pleasant stay.</LD>
<TE>   And, here's the kicker. They had to fit a moderate budget: not
more than $150 a night, double occupancy, tax included, high season.</TE>
<TE>   In a week's time, I certainly didn't see all of Paris' rooms. And
some of the most renowned hotels--perhaps your favorites--were booked
solid, leaving me no chance to take a peek. But what I did find was
encouraging: cordial staff; spotless carpets; fresh-smelling
bathrooms; clean linens; large windows that opened wide onto inner
courtyards, street scenes or rooftop views; and decor that ranged
from pleasant to highly original. With few exceptions, I was
impressed with the hotels I reviewed. It was tough to narrow the list
to the 15 (plus 10 alternates) detailed below.</TE>
<TE>   St-Germain District</TE>
<TE>   You needn't pitch a tent in the Tuileries to be close to the
Louvre. Just across the Seine lies the Left Bank neighborhood of
St-Germain, which takes its name from one of Paris' oldest churches,
St-Germain-des-Pres. The 11th century church holds concerts in its
chapel and attracts street performers to its sidewalks. Radiating
from its square are some of the best-known eateries in the city: Les
Deux Magots, Cafe de Flore, Brasserie Lipp.</TE>
<TE>   Stay in a hotel in St-Germain and you also are near the Musee
d'Orsay, the day-and-night hot spots of the Rue de Buci, restaurant
Le Procope and boutique shopping. Luxembourg Gardens also is within
walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel d'Angleterre</TE>
<TE>   Ben Franklin didn't and Ernest Hemingway did, or so say the wags.
The patriot wouldn't tread on enemy soil, seeing as how this
history-laden building was the British embassy in his day. So he
refused to sleep here. Hemingway, on the other hand, was just glad
for a cheap stay. No. 11, up a tipsy flight of stairs, is one that
could still fill that bill. This is one of the old-fashioned rooms,
so there's a bidet in the dimly lighted bath. Like other rooms here,
No. 11 has soaring ceilings, a large desk with two upholstered side
chairs, a luggage stand, adequate closet space, soft towels and a
nice basket of toiletries in the bath. It has two double beds and is
small but not cramped, and it looks out over a plant-filled courtyard
where breakfast is served in good weather. In unpleasant weather,
guests take breakfast in a drawing room dominated by a grand piano.</TE>
<TE>   Deluxe rooms, such as No. 21, are just out of price range for this
story, but it would be a shame not to at least tempt you with the
ones that have beamed ceilings, American-size floor space, updated
marble baths and, if they face the street, double-paned windows.</TE>
<TE>   D'Angleterre's perch on the Rue Jacob puts it just around the
corner from St-Germain-des-Pres Church in one direction and, in the
opposite direction, a block from the Seine, with the Louvre just

<TE>   Hotel de Saint-Germain</TE>
<TE>   If rooms No. 24 and 25 are representative, then guests of this
conveniently located hotel can expect clean, airy decor and services
that many other hotels in this category lack, such as an elevator and
a 24-hour front desk. Rooms include a full-length mirror and framed
art prints. Yes, standard rooms are small, as are the bathrooms. Some
doubles can be connected to create family quarters. Singles--the
hotel has but four of them--are even smaller and relegated to the
uppermost floor, reached by climbing a flight of stairs because the
elevator doesn't go to the top. I'd avoid a single room here, though,
because the windows are too small to let in either the view or the
breeze. However, many of Hotel de Saint-Germain's 30 rooms have large
double-paned windows that look beyond iron grillwork onto the
intersection of busy Rue du Four and Rue de Rennes, just a block
southwest of the landmark St-Germain-des-Pres Church.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby, too, is just big enough to get the job done. There's
space enough for check-in and checkout, but not for meeting friends
over a drink. Breakfast is served in a small, tidy room in the
basement.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel du Danube</TE>
<TE>   Just a few doors down from d'Angleterre, the Danube shares the
same enviable block of Rue Jacob, poised between the cafes around
St-Germain-des-Pres Church and the Seine. Though younger than the
d'Angleterre--the Danube wasn't built until the era of Napoleon
III--it has some history of its own. For a few months during World
War II, the head of the exiled Polish government lived here. I doubt
he was surrounded by the finer points of decor that guests of this
family-owned hotel experience today: the floral chintz fabrics and
the oil painting above the bed in quiet courtside room No. 45 or the
double-paned windows and the chandelier draped with garlands of
cherries in the street-side No. 2. Not only do the
"superior"-category rooms here accommodate our budget, but they also
accommodate high ceilings, vast windows, ample closets with
full-length mirrors, marble-topped dressers and large oval tea tables
with two upholstered side chairs. Plenty of space, in other words, to
take breakfast in your room, unless you'd rather eat it on the patio
adorned with potted palms or, depending on the weather, in an alcove
off the lobby. Even in an admittedly small standard courtyard room,
such as No. 57, it's possible to pull out the upholstered stools from
the built-in desk/dresser and have a bite to eat. The lobby is an odd
mix of old and new: mosaic tile floor, fresh flowers and Internet
access.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel le Regent</TE>
<TE>   OK, so it's a squeeze to get past the bed to the bathroom. And the
bathroom's not all that big either. But No. 43, a standard double, is
in our price range and has rooftop views, tastefully updated decor,
brocade drapes, a mirrored tray of toiletries--just like the deluxe
rooms in this 18th century building.</TE>
<TE>   Deluxe rooms that overlook the Rue Dauphine and get the afternoon
sun, such as Nos. 41 and 51, may have wall fabric that matches the
bedspread, where standard rooms have color-stained paneling--a cozy
forest green in the case of No. 43. But floor space, and
embellishments such as gilt-framed mirrors in the bath, are what
account for the price difference here. Otherwise, the hotel is
egalitarian. From the lobby's marble reception alcove, everyone must
climb a curved stairway to reach the elevator, or descend the steps
that spiral down to the vaulted breakfast cave.</TE>
<TE>   A two-or three-block walk up Rue Dauphine will put you on Pont
Neuf and Ile de la Cite. And if the bustle at Les Deux Magots has
frustrated your attempts to buy the famed cafe's logo items on
premises, you can buy them here at Le Regent. The same people own
both places.</TE>

<TE>   Latin Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame Cathedral and Ste-Chapelle are in the middle of the
Seine River on Ile de la Cite. Just across the bridge to the Left
Bank is the landmark Place St-Michel and the start of Boulevard
St-Michel. Boul Mich, as it is affectionately known, is one of Paris'
great thoroughfares, choked with traffic, swarming with people,
punctuated with crepe vendors and strewn with the sort of shoe stores
and clothing shops that seem to be perpetually holding a sale. Night
life thrives in the hodgepodge of small lanes between Boul Mich and
Rue du Petit Pont. Stay in a hotel near Place St-Michel, especially
along that subgroup of hodgepodge lanes, and you also are near the
Cluny Museum and the Sorbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel Europe St Severin</TE>
<TE>   This hotel, a few doors off Boul Mich down a comparatively quiet
side street, puts you close to the action without being overly
disturbed by it. Standard rooms such as No. 516 may sport window
treatments and bedspreads reminiscent of Toulouse-Lautrec poster
colors, or, in rooms such as No. 506, a tendency toward pastels. On
some floors, street-side rooms open onto wrought-iron balconies.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast is served in a dining room just off the lobby. And the
elevator is so large, by Parisian standards, as to be noteworthy;
perhaps six people could fit in it, sans luggage, of course. The
Seine is just a block away, where Pont St-Michel connects to Ile de
la Cite.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel Parc Saint Severin</TE>
<TE>   Tucked away on a quiet intersection, one block equidistant from
boulevards St-Germain and St-Michel, Hotel Parc Saint Severin is a
little hard to find. And its rates are even harder to believe. No.
43, for example, holds an entry hall, double closets, a queen bed,
marble-topped night stands, a desk and two side chairs, and a large
corner bath that overlooks leafy Rue de la Parcheminerie below--all
for $122, or so the staff swears. No. 61, with a large corner
balcony, is only a few dollars out of our price range at $175,
according to the staff. If these two rooms are representative, you
can expect the decor to highlight the satin sheen of soft blues and
off-whites. Breakfast is served in a reception area off the lobby. It
is about two blocks from the Seine.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel des Grandes Ecoles</TE>
<TE>   At the end of its private cobblestone lane, the Hotel des Grandes
Ecoles wraps around a small park all its own. When you're in a room
like No. 1, on the ground floor of the main building, it's hard to
tell where the fresh floral wallpaper ends and the blooming shrubs
outside begin. It's a bit off the track, but this hotel really does
capture the quiet, relaxed feel of a retreat in the countryside. Yet
in less than five minutes you can be strolling the street market of
Rue Mouffetard, standing at the front door of the Pantheon or
descending the Place Monge Metro stop, which gives you a straight
shot to the Louvre or the Opera. No wonder there's no TV here.</TE>
<TE>   Standard rooms have high ceilings, armoires and good-size
bathrooms with shelf or counter space for personal belongings. To
that, add queen-size beds, a sofa alcove and extra closet and floor
space to deluxe rooms such as No. 147 and No. 251. Crocheted
coverlets drape the beds and drip from the tabletops, both in the
rooms and in the salon where breakfast is served when the weather
prevents dining on the patio.</TE>

<TE>   Ile St-Louis</TE>
<TE>   Ile de la Cite and Ile St-Louis are neighboring islands in the
Seine River. Parisians have made tiny Ile St-Louis, four blocks long
and two blocks wide, a world unto itself. Its cobbled lanes are
mostly residential, except for Rue St-Louis-en-l'Ile and Rue des Deux
Ponts, which are bestowed with candle-lighted restaurants so intimate
that they can seat no more than 15 or 20 diners at a time, and
boutiques of the "nothing but" variety: nothing but olive products in
this one, nothing but fine cheeses in that one. It seems a third of
the storefronts also sell Berthillon ice cream, no doubt to prevent
the lines at any one place from growing too long. Clearly the point
is to stay on the island, not quibble about which of its four hotels
will have a vacancy. A room in our price range narrows the hotel
choices to three.</TE>
<TE>   Leave Ile St-Louis by way of Pont St-Louis, and you arrive on Ile
de la Cite at the rear gardens of Notre Dame. Cross Pont Marie, and
you're headed to the heart of the Marais district.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel de Lutece</TE>
<TE>   Lutece is a recent acquisition of the owners of Les Deux-Iles, a
three-star that makes all of the lists, including Gault Millau's Top
10. Rates and decor at both hotels are similar. Standard doubles are
small, with walls rough-stuccoed in white. Colors are confined to
bold, primary florals on the bed, drapes and chairs. Closet space is
adequate. If No. 115, on a featureless, shaft-like courtyard, is a
representative specimen, Lutece will facilitate a stay of two or
three nights--any longer and you'd start feeling cramped--if you can
ignore the muted echoes of conversations and clinking dishes that
find their way into the room. Lodgings higher up might be quieter;
No. 115 is on the first landing, just off the 17th century lobby that
seems perpetually awash in the comings, goings and meetings-up-with
of various guests.</TE>

<TE>   Marais District</TE>
<TE>   Until the early 1600s, the Marais was no more than a marsh outside
the city walls. But then the apartments that would come to be known
as the Place des Vosges were built, quite the fashionable address for
aristocrats until the court moved to Versailles. This open square of
apartments on the Right Bank has survived scandal, abandonment,
revolution and neglect. Now resurrected, it blocks out the noise of
the city while guarding a grassy park.</TE>
<TE>   Stay in a hotel near Place des Vosges and you are within a few
blocks of the hubbub of the Rues de Rivoli and St-Antoine, the
boutiques of the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, the antique dealers of Rue
St-Paul, the Musee National Picasso and Place de la Bastille.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel des Chevaliers</TE>
<TE>   A baby grand piano and a bossy poodle may rule the reception
parlor, but in the rooms, airy colors and a soft floral scent take
charge. Other nice room touches include textured wallpaper in solid
pastels, metal coat caddies, full-length mirrors and candy on the
bedside table. No. 21 had a window in the bath. No. 24 had a bigger
bathroom counter. And from No. 51 (a hike up one flight of a
stairwell with dwindling headroom), a rooftop view with a surprise:
At night the beacon atop the Eiffel Tower beamed through the open
windows. So what if that also lets in the street noise? And if it was
impossible to stand upright for a shower because No. 51's tub was
tucked under the eaves, another so what.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee drinkers who have reached their limit with demitasse
servings of dark roast will welcome the carafes of American-style
brew placed on the tables in the 17th century vaulted breakfast cave.
Orange juice, boiled eggs and cereal also are served, but skip the
doughy croissants; the ones at the boulangerie across the street are
flakier. Place des Vosges is a block away around one corner.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel Saint-Louis Marais</TE>
<TE>   Homey Hotel Saint-Louis Marais has the advantage of seeming out of
the way without actually being out of the way. It's three blocks to
the Place des Vosges, three to the Seine, two to the antique shops of
Rue St-Paul and two to the Sully Morland Metro stop. Fans of the old
"Angelique" series of historical romance novels will be thrilled to
stay only half a block from Rue Beautrellis, which figured
prominently.</TE>
<TE>   Just off the hotel's understated lobby, ground-floor No. 1 is a
spacious gem of redecorating, from the quarry-tiled floor to the
wood-beamed ceiling. Furnishings include a corner closet, five-drawer
dresser, stuccoed walls of pale apricot, an Oriental carpet and, as
is typical in many Paris hotel rooms, twin beds pushed together to
make a king. Large double-paned windows open onto little-used Rue du
Petit Musc. A full-length mirror hangs in the entry vestibule, off
which opens a bath updated with decorative tile and, up two steps, a
good-size shower. Also typical in many small hotels, other rooms are
in various stages of refurbishment. Roomy No. 4 sports smart
hunter-green walls, russet carpet and built-in storage on either side
of a makeshift king--all freshly updated until you reach the cracks
in the old bathroom tile. The plain-vanilla walls of small,
double-bedded No. 3 are relieved by matching fabrics at the windows
and on the bed. But its marble-walled bathroom awaits a replacement
for the linoleum floor.</TE>

<TE>   Hotel Saint Paul le Marais</TE>
<TE>   This hotel's public areas are so welcoming that you may never want
to go to your room. The lobby, dominated by red-and-gold brocade, is
large enough for small groups to congregate around the cozy corner
bar--if they can keep themselves from accessing the Internet or
drifting out onto the adjacent brick-paved terrace set with
flowerpots and patio furniture. In the basement, anyone who has the
willpower to walk past the small beauty institute, where
hydrotherapy, body and facial treatments are given, can eat breakfast
in the modestly furnished barrel-vaulted cave.</TE>
<TE>   The guest rooms' lighting is brighter than that of many lodgings.
Armoires and subdued colors lend charm, though some rooms seem ready
for new carpet. Another rarity: This hotel supplies in-room coffee
makers, welcome news for travelers who can't wait for the cafes to
open or the hotel to commence breakfast service. Ground-floor rooms,
such as double-bedded No. 11, open directly onto the brick patio. On
a higher floor, single-bedded No. 316 overlooks the patio from
windows in bed and bath and, for families, can connect with the
adjoining room.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel's front door opens onto the shops and cafes of Rue de

<TE>   Luxembourg Gardens Area</TE>
<TE>   In a capital where so much real estate is given over to traffic
snarls, treeless boulevards and whole cityscapes of chalk-colored
housing, parks are a joyous relief. Luxembourg Gardens is one of the
city's largest, with gravel walkways, classical statues, puppet
shows, a pond for toy boats and a fountain. Parisians flock here to
sit in long rows of chairs, face the grass and kick back with a book
or a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Three of Paris' most famed neighborhoods converge around the park:
St-Germain, Montparnasse and the Latin Quarter. So do shops and
sidewalk cafes. But choosing a hotel near Luxembourg Gardens in the
Latin Quarter will also put you close to the Sorbonne, the Pantheon,
the Cluny Museum, a slightly less hectic section of Boulevard
St-Michel and, a little farther away, the market-by-day
hot-spot-by-night Rue Mouffetard.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Hotel St-Michel</TE>
<TE>   The rooms are American-size and smell of roses. The furniture is
new but "antique," and architectural prints adorn the walls. The
baths are marble with cultured granite counters, sheet-size towels
and toiletries nestled in a silver dish. The writing desk conceals a
minibar.</TE>
<TE>   Iron grills and geraniums in the window boxes frame views of the
Sorbonne from street-side rooms, such as No. 405, or of a residential
courtyard from a vast L-shaped family room, such as No. 408. Down a
circular stone stairwell, an ample breakfast, including cheese and
cold cuts, is served in the large barrel-vaulted breakfast cave.
Coffee, tea and spirits are served at the bar in the lobby, which is
dressed to the hilt in crystal chandeliers, brocade fabrics and
trompe l'oeil ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Hotel St-Michel--and an inviting little tearoom, I might

wallpaper and lavender drapes in No. 43.</TE>

<TE>   Eiffel Tower Area</TE>
<TE>   By day, major streets in this part of town are furious with
traffic and clogged with tourists. But early mornings and by night,
the area between Parc du Champ de Mars and the park-like swath of the
Invalides complex returns to the quiet, gentrified Left Bank
neighborhood that it is. Some simply refer to this as the Rue Cler
area because of the two-block-long Rue Cler street market, which,
besides butcher and produce stands, has a fair share of cafes and
modest gift shops. Some sidewalk restaurants in the neighborhood have
Eiffel Tower views.</TE>
<TE>   Stay in a hotel near Rue Cler, and you also are a 20-minute amble
from the base of the Eiffel Tower, less than that to Napoleon's tomb.
The Rodin Museum, UNESCO world headquarters and the oddball tour of
the Paris sewers, Les Egouts, are within strolling distance.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Hotel Leveque</TE>
<TE>   This refurbished hotel opens right onto the pedestrian-only
section of Rue Cler. Its front door and, by extension, its tiny
reception area seem almost a part of the street market. Moderate-size
rooms offer uncomplicated decor but have built-in closets or
armoires, and bathrooms with a few more inches of floor space than
some other two-stars. Windows are tall. Rooms, such as No. 44, that
face a quiet courtyard may allow their lodgers to be awakened by
morning birdsong. Rooms facing Rue Cler from the lower floors, such
as No. 41, may overlook the market and the window boxes of apartments
across the street. Higher up, No. 52 gets a straight shot at the top
of the Eiffel Tower. Travelers looking for a little extra space in
their room might like No. 43, a street-facing double that becomes a

<TE>   Breakfast is served in a dining room off the lobby; though those
who need coffee or snacks during other hours can get them from the
hotel's ice and vending machines--a rare thing in Paris' small hotels
and almost unheard of in a two-star. No wonder Grand Hotel Leveque
has been recommended by everyone from Rick Steves to Michelin.</TE>

<TE>   The rooms at Relais Bosquet have air-conditioning, double-paned

guidelines by $10, and superior-category No. 41 is within our budget:
a generous king-bedded space done up in yellows, greens and aquas
with a three-drawer chest, a built-in armoire and a double sink in
the bath. Standard-level room No. 45, though smaller, is still roomy
and follows a red-and-gold color scheme. And this is one hotel where
the elevator goes all the way to the top; no trudging a flight of
stairs to reach No. 61, where the ceiling slopes with the roofline
and the view from the windows takes in the gilded dome that covers
Napoleon's tomb.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Wondrous architecture--Frank O. Gehry's Guggenheim
museum in Bilbao and Antonio Gaudi's organic designs in
Barcelona--are partly what drew this week's "Best Shot" photographer
to Spain. But it was this pair of whimsical, handy door knockers on
an unidentified building in Barcelona that made one of the most
lasting impressions. The photographer, U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Raymond C. Fisher, was vacationing last year with his
wife, Nancy. They stumbled on this sight while wandering down "an
otherwise unexceptional side street off the Plaza de Catalunya,"
writes Fisher, adding that "we still chuckle and think fondly of
Barcelona every time we look at it."</CP>

<DL>OFF THE COAST OF WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>My hands gripped the varnished helm as I steered by the stars,
halfway through a midnight watch. My heading was north by northwest,
keeping the Big Dipper fixed in the rigging of the tall ship Lady
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific was calm except for the long ocean swells that tugged
at the rudder. A full moon illuminated the southern sky, glittering
off our wake. Above me, a loose line flapped against the
mainmast--not the tinny clank of steel on aluminum, but the hearty
thunk-thunk of hemp on wood.</LD>
<LD>   For people like me, who have voyaged through the pages of Joseph
Conrad and Patrick O'Brian, this is the stuff of dreams. Many a salty
fantasy will be fired up from Friday until Sept. 10 when a fleet of
14 tall ships parades into Los Angeles Harbor for a celebration of
sail. Visitors are welcome, and armchair sailors can line up for a
chance to explore one or more of these classic sailing ships. Some
will cough up $50 for a 2 1/2-hour cruise. And some of them will sign
up for a chance to live their fantasies on a longer voyage.</LD>
<TE>   This visit represents the largest Southern California assembly of
traditional tall ships in years, dramatizing a remarkable maritime
comeback. A generation ago, only a few vessels from the Age of Sail
could be found, the rest having rotted on their mooring lines as
steam-and diesel-engine ships replaced them.</TE>
<TE>   But a worldwide fleet is growing steadily. Some ships were
restored, and many more have been built new, reviving centuries-old
shipwrights' skills. Why the renaissance? Many of the larger vessels,
such as the 262-foot Ecuadorean-flag Guayas, which visited San Pedro
in August, are used as naval training vessels on which young sailors
learn teamwork and seamanship.</TE>
<TE>   Others are used to teach the same lessons to at-risk kids or other
youths. Witness the Los Angeles Maritime Institute in San Pedro,
which has two handsome ships that sail almost exclusively with groups
of inner-city kids.</TE>
<TE>   Still others are replicas of historical vessels; the Lady
Washington was built in Grays Harbor, Wash., to commemorate the
voyage of Robert Gray, a Boston fur trader who sailed the Pacific
Northwest in 1792, lending his name to various regional landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   This growing fleet also provides opportunities for people like me,
who simply yearn to help sail these spectacular ships and who are
willing to spend some combination of travel dollars and sweat equity
for that opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   I found my ship in June, moored at the old fishing port of St.
Helens, about 25 miles down the Columbia River from Portland, Ore.
Sea bag slung over my shoulder, I stood on the dock and admired the
vessel that would be home for four days.</TE>
<TE>   By today's standards, the Lady Washington is small--only 87 feet.
But what it lacks in scale it makes up in sheer elegance--an 18th
century brigantine with a raised stern, wood scrollwork painted in
primary colors and offset by varnished mahogany, two stout masts and
a 20-foot bowsprit supporting impossibly intricate rigging that
includes 150 lines strung from the sails to the rails.</TE>
<TE>   I climbed the gangplank and introduced myself to the skipper,
Kevin McKee, who assigned me to Prairie, a 19-year-old salt with long
blond hair tied in a nautical knot. Prairie fitted me with a
climber's harness, showed me how to clip onto a line and escorted me
up the forward mast.</TE>
<TE>   "As a trainee," she instructed me, "you should keep yourself
clipped in. And always maintain three points of contact with the
rigging." With enthusiasm, I agreed and up we went, 35 feet, then out
onto a yardarm. I enjoyed the view for about 30 seconds and then,
with a queasy feeling in my stomach, decided to climb back down.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later we were welcoming aboard the local Chamber of
Commerce, which had chartered the ship for an evening cruise. We
tossed off our lines, motored out into the Lower Columbia River,
turned into the wind and raised sails. I watched alongside the local
merchants as my young shipmates, in pirate-like period dress and Teva
sandals, with gold rings dangling from various body parts, scrambled
up the rigging and onto the yardarms like the Flying Wallendas. A few
minutes later we were angling off the wind, sporting a dozen grand,
white, trapezoidal sails, each bulging in the evening breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived 70 years," one of our passengers declared, mostly to
himself. "And I never dreamed I'd see anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   After delivering our passengers back to St. Helens, the skipper
mustered his motley crew of 16 men and women. There was Ryan Meyer,
the 22-year-old first mate, whose gold earring and long black
ponytail are a perfect fit with the ship's ambience. Meyer spotted
the Lady Washington sailing into Ventura in 1998, stepped aboard and
volunteered. Today he has a Coast Guard license and sometimes
skippers the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   Or Margaret Strozyk, a gutsy 19-year-old from Aberdeen, Wash., who
has been volunteering for more than a year. She's also been studying
for her captain's license. Or Michael Kellick, a part-time actor from
Los Angeles, who has been known to sail a tall ship in the morning,
then report as an extra on a science fiction episode of "The X-Files"
in the afternoon. Or David Fielder, a 50-ish graybeard from Portland,
whose idea of a week's vacation is to catch up with the Lady
Washington and pay $25 a day for the privilege of crewing on an
offshore transit.</TE>
<TE>   Our mission: to sail this tall ship down the Columbia and up the
Washington Coast to Puget Sound and Seattle. Just before midnight, we
tossed off the mooring lines and turned downriver.</TE>
<TE>   I was assigned to the midnight watch, reporting to Tamara Becker,
a Washingtonian for whom the cruise was truly a busman's holiday; in
her other life, she works as a licensed mate aboard oil tankers. For
the next four days, I did what I was told by a 5-foot-tall woman with
chemically assisted red hair and several years at sea. We motored
through the darkness as a light show of riverfront towns, shopping
centers and pulp mills glided by, eerily reflected on the water.
Every 30 minutes or so we passed an incoming freighter, with Becker
exchanging greetings on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   I took my first stint at the helm, steering between the red-and
green-lighted buoys that designate the shipping lanes, matching them
with the navigational chart while trying to learn the idiosyncrasies
of the heavy helm. Even under power, it was a cosmic journey--an 18th
century spaceship cruising through a 21st century galaxy. At 4 a.m.
we were relieved by the next watch. I crawled into my bunk alongside
the ship's galley and sailed off to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, I found out why nobody else had claimed this
bunk as the cook served up bacon and eggs to a hungry crew mere
inches from my head. Up on deck, the river had broadened as we neared
the ocean. The crew expressed some anxiety as we approached the
Columbia Bar, the notorious "Graveyard of the Pacific," where the
mighty river's flow collides with incoming ocean swells.</TE>
<TE>   The crossing, however, proved uneventful--mellow, Meyer called it.
The only casualty was a lanky 18-year-old who minutes before had been
scrambling through the rigging. Now he lay on the deck holding his
stomach, while his friends leaned over and offered remedies for
seasickness.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise up the coast was equally mellow--calm seas, bright sun
and a gentle northerly breeze. Now and then the ship would lurch on
the front of a large wave, triggering a few musical groans and
squeaks in the rigging. But mostly we worked to the throaty rumble of
the diesel engine, standing our watches, then spending the off-duty
hours sanding and varnishing hatches and rails. I watched Kellick,
the part-time actor, weave an artful marlinspike sheathing around
some lines at the stern. As he worked, he hummed a sea chantey and
then told his story: He was strolling the piers at San Pedro one day
when he decided to spend $25 for a day sail on the schooner Swift,
operated by the Los Angeles Maritime Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "I was overwhelmed," he says. "I couldn't believe that a guy like
me could actually still sail on one of these incredible ships. It's
amazing where you can go and what you can do in this world if you're
willing to do a little work."</TE>
<TE>   On our third day we approached Cape Flattery, which marks the
entrance to the broad Strait of Juan de Fuca and, ultimately, to
Puget Sound. From five miles offshore, I studied the shoreline,
imagining myself on watch for Capt. Cook or George Vancouver or the
various Spanish sailors who explored this coastline in the 1700s.
Each was looking for the fabled Northwest Passage--the shortcut to
Asia that would eliminate the need to sail around the tip of South
America.</TE>
<TE>   For two centuries, this storied place near latitude 48 degrees
north was the Holy Grail. But it was Cook, who doubted the existence
of any such passage, who dubbed this point "Flattery" and sailed
northward, missing the strait altogether. Once round the point, our
skipper ordered his crew back to the rigging to raise sails--a
welcome relief from the engine's drone. Now the Lady Washington
cruised proudly on the same course and by the same wind as countless
ships before it.</TE>
<TE>   My last midnight watch began midway down the strait. We seemed to
be alone in the 20-mile-wide waterway. The lights of Port Angeles
drifted by to starboard, and the full moon was enveloped in a silky
horseshoe-shaped cloud. Becker kept me company at the helm, watching
my compass heading, scolding me when I wandered.</TE>
<TE>   Why, I asked, do people go to the effort to sail these ships?
"People are tired of dealing with computers," she said. "People want
to have adventures where they rely on their own skill and ingenuity."</TE>
<TE>   Kellick emerged from the forward hatch and joined us, reciting
something suitably romantic from Shakespeare, then offering his
perspective. "I think tall ships provide an index to our natural
selves," he said. "So much of our lives is artificial, the latest
electronics or the latest shampoo. Sailing a tall ship is real. It's
a genuine challenge. You have to learn something about the physics of
wind and wood and sails. You have to learn a new language. You have
to work with people you don't know. Eventually you're going to find
yourself in a hairy situation, and the only solution is to rely on
yourself and on your shipmates."</TE>
<TE>   In our four-day voyage, we encountered nothing hairier than a
moderate northerly. But we still managed to learn a few things.</TE>
<TE>   Boats, after all, are not about going someplace. They are
getaways. Anybody who has ever gone to sea knows that much of the
appeal has to do with leaving day-to-day problems and worries behind
on the dock. For the duration of the voyage, be it an afternoon or a
month, the sailor's only problem is to find the wind and harness it,
to ride powerful natural forces. The ship is the destination.</TE>
<TE>   And all the better if that ship is a tall one.</TE>

<HD>Getting Your Sea Legs: How to Fulfill Those Tall-Ship
Dreams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Anderson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A generation or so ago, a sailor in search of a tall ship would have
needed a time machine. But the fleet of 14 vessels that is to enter
Los Angeles Harbor on Friday provides dramatic evidence that tall
ships have sailed back onto the traveler's horizon. And the docks at
San Pedro are an excellent place to explore them.</LD>
<LD>   Before you look for your ship, here are a few things to remember:</LD>
<LD>   * Don't assume that sailing a tall ship will cost hundreds of
dollars a day. Some do, but others are surprisingly reasonable,
especially if you are willing to pitch in, hoisting sails, coiling
lines or swabbing the deck.</LD>
<TE>   * Don't expect to find luxury. Sailing ships specialize in spartan
dormitory conditions, often shared with the crew. There will be one
or two shared baths and toilets that instruct what can and cannot be
flushed. The food is likely to be wholesome and plentiful but not
gourmet. And if the guy in the next bunk snores, a gentle kick can be
effective.</TE>
<TE>   * Learn the lingo. Know port from starboard, schooners from
square-riggers, sheets from halyards. And remember, tall ships have
no "ropes," only "lines."</TE>
<TE>   * If you're told to bring something, take it seriously. Sailing
trips can become miserable without seemingly expendable items such as
rubber boots and foul weather gear, gloves or even a flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   Where the Ships Are</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few ways to find a tall ship cruise:</TE>
<TE>   * Rely on word-of-mouth or the Web to find your cruise. Or try
Ocean Voyages, of Sausalito, (800) 299-4444, oceanvoyages.com, which
books individuals and groups on sailing ships. Their clients include
two of the vessels sailing into San Pedro--the 185-foot square-rigger
Europa and the 85-foot schooner R. Tucker Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Most tall ships are operated by individuals or groups enamored of
wood boats and sails but who know little about marketing and hate the
idea of paying fees to travel agencies. Many ships are nonprofits
that focus on educational cruises but are open to the idea of paying
passengers as well. If in doubt, ask.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a day cruise. There may never be a better time. Many of the
ships docked at San Pedro will be offering short cruises for $50.
Other opportunities will be available at two smaller tall ships
festivals later this month. The ships will congregate Sept. 12 to 15
in San Diego (call [619] 234-9153 or see www.sdmaritime.com for
details) and Sept. 20 to 22 at Dana Point (call [949] 496-2274 or see
www.tallshipsfestival.com).</TE>
<TE>   A few ships based in Southern California offer day cruises
year-round. The 118-foot schooner Spirit of Dana Point, based in the
south Orange County city, has a regular cruise schedule. Call (949)
496-2274, or see www.ocean-institute.org. In Newport Beach, the
122-foot privateer schooner Lynx is available for day sails and
longer cruises. Call Alison Woods at (949) 723-7814 or Catherine Malm
at (949) 642-5031 or see www.privateerlynx.org. In Long Beach, the
130-foot schooner American Pride has a regular cruise schedule,
including brunch and sunset dinner trips. Call the American Heritage
Marine Institute, (714) 970-8800, or see www.americanpride.org.</TE>
<TE>   * If a short sail merely whets your appetite, look into a longer
cruise--three days to a week. You can work through a specialized
agency like Ocean Voyages or do it on your own.</TE>
<TE>   * The best-established cruises are the Windjammer schooners that
sail throughout the Atlantic Coast and Caribbean. Contact the Maine
Windjammer Assn., (800) 807-9463, www.sailmainecoast.com. Much more
luxurious are Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, which sail the Caribbean.
Call Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, (800) 327-2601, www.windjammer.com.</TE>
<TE>   * There are increasing options for sailing West Coast waters, but
the trick is striking a deal. The Europa, which handles up to 50
passengers, is selling berths on its four-day Los Angeles-to-San
Diego leg for $695, and pricier legs as it continues south. The
schooner Zodiac, a 127-footer based in Puget Sound, sold all its
$2,000 berths on its Seattle-to-San Francisco voyage last month, but
still has berths available for the return voyage. Call Ocean Voyages
to book either the Europa or the Zodiac.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Washington, which sails Puget Sound and the Pacific
Northwest in the summer, now winters in California. The ship passes
much of its time taking schoolchildren on educational cruises. But
the skipper will happily take paying passengers on transits from one
port to the next for $105 per day--which is a bargain, even
considering the rugged quarters. Call (800) 200-5239,
www.ladywashington.org.</TE>
<TE>   These ships operate on very tight budgets, and paying passengers
help the skipper meet the next grocery tab.</TE>
<TE>   * Organize a charter. Each year, my wife and I reserve a weekend
on the schooner Zodiac, then get on the phone and the Web to recruit
about 20 friends and friends of friends willing to spend about $150 a
day for a three-day cruise through the San Juan Islands. We've never
failed to fill the ship. Each year it's a different crew, with a
smattering of returnees. And each year is more delightful than the
last--new friends thrust together on the deck of a 75-year-old
sailing ship.</TE>
<TE>   * Sign up for an Elderhostel at sea. Elderhostel is an
international organization that puts together educational programs
for people 55 and older. Most are at universities during summer
vacation, but some are staged aboard tall ships and at budget rates.
Programs are available off the coasts of California, Alabama, Maine
and even Denmark. Contact the organization at (877) 426-8056 or at
elderhostel.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Volunteer. Most tall ships operate with a small cadre of paid
people--a skipper, cook and perhaps a first mate. The rest of the
crew are unpaid volunteers, most of whom show up and express a
willingness to exchange sweat equity for sea time. The L.A. Maritime
Institute conducts regular classes for volunteers, who then are
called as needed. Call (310) 833-6055 or see
www.brigantines.com/lami.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Sailing ships are labor intensive. Besides manning the sails,
there is always cabinetry to be sanded and varnished, brass to be
polished, decks to be swabbed, toilets to be sanitized. In keeping
with maritime traditions, crew members are likely to be assigned to a
four-hour shift, or watch, every 12 hours, so you'll be on duty from
noon to 4 p.m., then again from midnight to 4 a.m. It may sound
arduous, but the work is tackled amid the ambience of a grand old
sailing ship, which makes each task an adventure.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Get a natural high at Yellowstone National Park this fall on two-day
wildlife safaris that will stalk the park's wolves, grizzlies and
elk.</LD>
<LD>   The expeditions, sponsored by the nonprofit Teton Science School
of Jackson Hole, Wyo., are timed to coincide with the park's autumn
transition when animals prepare for winter, and aspens and cottonwood
trees turn yellow and gold.</LD>
<LD>   "The big draw are the bull elk," said Marlene Claflin, an
administrative director at Wildlife Expeditions, a division of the
science school.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the time of year when they bugle to round up their harems
for mating. It's fascinating: a high, piercing sound that echoes
through the forest."</TE>
<TE>   There are wolves and grizzlies to see too. The wolves, drawn by
the large number of elk, are busy hunting. And the bears are stocking
up on food for their winter hibernation.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists familiar with the terrain and with the animals lead the
tours, scheduled from Sept. 17 to Oct. 5. Besides wildlife viewing
stops, the expeditions will visit Old Faithful Geyser, the waterfall
at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the terraces of Mammoth
Hot Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $450 per person, double occupancy, including hotel, meals,
round-trip transportation from Jackson Hole into Yellowstone and park
entrance fees. Round-trip air fare from LAX to Jackson Hole is not
included.</TE>

<TE>   Guatemala: Folk Art</TE>
<TE>   Explore the land, culture and art of Guatemala during a two-week
tour that coincides with the nation's festive All Souls' Day
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The tour, which begins Oct. 22, focuses on the crafts and folk art
of the Central American country. Guatemalans celebrate All Souls' Day
on Nov. 2 by inviting the souls of deceased relatives to return to
Earth, where they are welcomed with special foods, decorations and
huge, colorful kites.</TE>
<TE>   The tour group will visit Guatemala City, Antigua,
Chichicastenango, Huehuetenango, Lake Atitlan and various smaller
Indian communities. Excursions are planned to visit artists and
craftsmen in their homes and villages.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,743 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip
air fare from Los Angeles or San Francisco to Guatemala City,
accommodations, all meals, activities and gratuities.</TE>

<TE>   Italy: For a Song</TE>
<TE>   With the summer tourist season over, many agencies that specialize
in European tours are discounting their trips to capture fall and
winter business.</TE>
<TE>   Among the low-cost specials is a $199 package that includes five
nights in one of Italy's best-known cities: Rome, Florence, Venice,
Naples or Palermo. The package, based on double occupancy, includes
hotel, breakfasts and service charges but not air fare. It can be
purchased for travel from mid-November through mid-February. It is
not available for the Christmas/New Year's period.</TE>

<TE>   Mexico: Turtle Watching</TE>
<TE>   Give nature a helping hand during a Baja Discovery tour that
focuses on saving an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   The six-day trips, which will depart Sept. 28 and Oct. 5, are
based in Punta Rancho San Cristobal, a coastal region 12 miles north
of Cabo San Lucas. At night, participants search for Olive Ridley
turtles as they come ashore to lay their eggs, moving the eggs to a
nursery to guard them from predators. During the day, the hatchlings
are released to the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Participants will stay in a tent camp with naturalists. A
nonprofit Mexican environmental association sponsors the camp to help
sea turtles in southern Baja. About 30,000 hatchlings were released
from the camp's nursery last year.</TE>
<TE>   Guided hiking tours, a boat excursion and snorkeling are also
included.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $1,195 per person, including ground transportation from the
Los Cabos airport to Punta Rancho San Cristobal, land transfers, four
nights at the turtle camp, meals at the camp, excursions, one night
in a hotel and a donation of $100 per person to the Mexican
environmental association, ASUPMATOMA. Air fare from Los Angeles to
Los Cabos is not included.</TE>
<TE>   Contact: Baja Discovery; (800) 829-2252, www.bajadiscovery.com.</TE>
<TE>   Japan: Autumn Leaves</TE>
<TE>   Watch Japan's maples put on a vibrant show of colors during
two-week tours that depart Oct. 26 and 28. The tours will visit
Japan's best-known cities besides making stops at historic rural
areas in the mountains near Mt. Fuji. The trips will begin with four
nights at the Hyatt-Regency in Tokyo. Other stops are Nikko, Kyoto,
Nara, Osaka and the smaller Mt. Fuji-region cities of Hokone,
Takayama and Gifu.</TE>
<TE>   The group will travel by plane, bus, boat, train and cable car.</TE>

<HD>Davis Should Land in the Hall of Fame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE KINDRED</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All dressed up with nowhere to run, Terrell Davis yet lit up the
place with his glorious smile. One last time he had put on the
Broncos uniform, stood tall and snapped off a Mile High salute.</LD>
<LD>   He'd come to tell his friends good-bye.</LD>
<LD>   Though he couldn't play, he wanted to be on the sideline to feel
again the electricity generated by the Denver zealots, many of whom
seem compelled to paint their faces orange and blue.</LD>
<TE>   They'd seen him run into, over, around, through and away from
defenders a thousand times. Now they would see him leave them.</TE>
<TE>   A knee. Isn't it always a knee with running backs? Football's
stars, they're also the game's disposable parts, always one step away
from the end.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the gods stay in one piece: Jim Brown, Walter Payton,
Barry Sanders, Emmitt Smith. But mortals know the day is coming,
sooner than later, when they will go down in a shriek of pain never
to be the same again.</TE>
<TE>   How it must hurt an extraordinary athlete to realize he has been
rendered ordinary. Gone is the package of lightness, speed, instinct
and ferocity that Bear Bryant called "reckless abandon."</TE>
<TE>   In its place, memory.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder, then, that Terrell Davis wanted to wear his play
clothes one more time.</TE>
<TE>   He'd gone on the Broncos' injured reserve list. The move was
effectively a retirement after three seasons in which a knee made him
a part-time player.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it a surprise, memory being powerful and pleasant, that at
day's end Davis told reporters he might not be retired at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have a lot of football left in me, a lot of great
football left in me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When we hear such talk from an aging athlete--a bad knee at 29,
you're old--there is playing under the words the melancholy music of
denial. No star wants to be asked off the stage, taken out of the key
light that makes him the cynosure of all eyes.</TE>
<TE>   So we saw Willie Mays stumble, and we shouted that he should have
quit long before. Why, oh why, did Johnny Unitas ever play with a
lightning bolt on his helmet instead of a horseshoe?</TE>
<TE>   We saw Michael Jordan limp behind gazelles 15 years younger, and
we wished he hadn't done that.</TE>
<TE>   Why does Mario Lemieux insist? Will someone, please, tell Evander
Holyfield to look in a mirror?</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom is that these stars betrayed their
legacies by staying at the dance too long (or coming back uninvited).
The kinder truth is, even their failures were life-affirming. They
squeezed from their work every drop of satisfaction. They left
nothing undone that might have been done.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Terrell Davis believes he has football left in him.
Without such passion, no 196th draft choice could have become a Super
Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame running back. There's talk of surgery that
might cause a regeneration of bone that would let Davis run again.</TE>
<TE>   There's a chance rest will work a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Dave, stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Two sentences back, you mentioned the Hall of Fame for Davis. You
cannot be serious.</TE>
<TE>   Great guy, sweet guy, but Davis played only seven years, and the
last three he barely played at all. Explain to us why you're sending
him to Canton.</TE>
<TE>   Three reasons. First, impact. It's simplistic but true that John
Elway lost every Super Bowl he played before Davis arrived and won
every one with Davis. That's 0-3 without T.D., 2-0 with him. Elway
would have been a Hall of Famer in any case, but Davis' work will
make it possible for the golden boy to walk into Canton head high.</TE>
<TE>   Second, numbers. To measure how astounding Davis' first four
seasons were, stack up his numbers against the best four-year
stretches for the gods Brown, Payton, Sanders and Smith:</TE>
<TE>   * Davis--1995-98, 61 games, 1,343 carries, 6,413 yards, 4.8
average, 105 yards per game, 56 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   * Brown--1962-65, 56 games, 1,090 carries, 5,849 yards, 5.4
average, 104 yards per game, 49 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   * Payton--1977-80, 62 games, 1,358 carries, 6,317 yards, 4.7
average, 102 yards per game, 45 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   * Sanders--1994-97, 64 games, 1,287 carries, 6,989 yards, 5.4
average, 109 yards per game, 40 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   * Smith--1992-95, 61 games, 1,401 carries, 6,456 yards, 4.6
average, 106 yards per game, 73 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Third, rare work. Among those five, only Davis and Sanders rushed
for 2,000 yards in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Only Davis rushed for 100 yards in each of seven consecutive
playoff games. Only Davis scored three rushing touchdowns in a Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The weakness in any Hall of Fame argument for Davis is he had only
those four good years, followed by 17 games in three more seasons.
Most Hall voters likely would see Davis unqualified simply on the
matter of longevity.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent comes the Broncos' coach, Mike Shanahan, whose personal
bias is at least in part neutralized by his expertise and up-close
observation.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody played big games better than Terrell Davis," Shanahan
says. "He is a first-ballot Hall of Famer."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Times columnist Dan Daly would have doubters remember
John Henry Johnson. Elected to the NFL Hall of Fame in 1987, Johnson
played 143 games in 13 seasons. He carried 1,571 times for 6,803
yards and 48 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Those are nice numbers basically matched by Davis in less than
half the games.</TE>
<TE>   "And," writes Daly, "you're going to put John Henry in the Hall
but not Terrell? Explain that one to me."</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan and Daly have it right. We owe the man our own salute.</TE>

<HD>Arab States Disavow Anti-Jewish Remarks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The 22-nation League of Arab States distanced itself through a
spokesman Saturday from anti-Jewish comments made last week at a
seminar whose participants called Jews "enemies of all nations" and
challenged the Jewish claim to Israel as a homeland.</LD>
<LD>   The conference on "Semitism" was sponsored by a think tank in Abu
Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, affiliated with the Arab League, and
although the league did not have a hand in organizing the event, it
sent an official representative. That prompted sharp criticism from
U.S. Jewish groups, which said the presence of a respected
organization such as the Arab League gave credibility to the charges.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the meeting, organized by the Zayed Center for
Coordination and Follow-Up, were reported in Saturday's editions of
The Times. Initially, the Arab League had declined to comment through
the spokesman, who said that it would first be necessary for him to
receive a report from the league's representative at the meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "The Arab League does not believe that the Palestinian question or
that the problem in the region is a problem between Jews and Arabs,"
league spokesman Hisham Youssef said Saturday after reading The
Times' report. "This is categorically not the case. The question is a
question between an occupier and people that are working on ending
this occupation."</TE>
<TE>   Youssef said that the league's reputation should in no way be
sullied by statements made by others because the gathering was "an
academic seminar." He said it was important for the league to
participate to present its views, including an explanation that Arabs
are Semites and therefore cannot properly be called anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that the Arab League recognizes Israel's right to
exist within its pre-1967 borders.</TE>

<HD>Controversial Exhibit Reveals What Lies Beneath</HD>
<DH>Britain: Some hail a unique display of corpses as good
science and fine art. Critics call it ghoulish voyeurism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Leave your body to science, or endow the arts? With professor Gunther
von Hagens, you could do both.</LD>
<LD>   Von Hagens has shocked and intrigued people throughout Europe with
his Body Worlds exhibition, a controversial display of human corpses,
preserved, stripped, dissected and explained in biological detail.</LD>
<LD>   Body Worlds has been greeted variously as a unique art exhibit, a
brilliant lesson in anatomy and a ghoulish invitation to voyeurism.</LD>
<TE>   The fleshless corpses are positioned in poses--swimming, running,
riding, cycling. Controversial exhibits include a reclining pregnant
woman and several fetuses, some normal, some deformed.</TE>
<TE>   "The human body has always been chastised," Von Hagens said. "For
instance, Hollywood has influenced us by connecting anatomy with
decay, dying, crime and horror. Here I want to get away from the
cruelty, to give people an aesthetic shock."</TE>
<TE>   The show has attracted more than 9 million visitors to its various
venues over the last five years, including more than a quarter of a
million in the first four months of its run at a converted East
London brewery. Inspired by the show, a score of Britons have
recently pledged their bodies for future exhibits. The professor and
his team are making plans to move the exhibits to the United States
this year.</TE>
<TE>   It all began 25 years ago at Heidelberg University in Germany. Von
Hagens, then an assistant anatomy professor, felt frustrated by
studying anatomy with badly preserved specimens.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a new way to preserve human tissue which actually makes
it dry, odorless and retains color," the professor said of his
specimens. He has patented his method, which he calls "plastination."</TE>
<TE>   Plastination goes beyond the simple embalming process with
formaldehyde. In a several-step process, bodily fluids are removed
and ultimately replaced with a silicon-type substance, or polymer,
which keeps the specimen pliable. Thus, the body becomes a life-size,
multidimensional, visible, touchable specimen.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy and debate have accompanied the exhibit since it
opened here in April. A number of lawmakers tried to ban the
exhibition, and protesters have attacked some of the specimens. One
visitor, Martin Wyness, threw a cover over the reclining pregnant
woman and poured paint around the body to keep people away.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Webster, a founder of a support group established in the wake
of an organ-harvesting scandal at a Liverpool hospital, said she had
been prepared to demonstrate against the exhibition. "But now I've
seen it and seen how educational it is," she said. "Anybody who's
interested in anatomy should see it. I even took my 10-year-old
daughter."</TE>
<TE>   But Peter McCaig, editor of the ecological publication Green
Events, was outraged on hearing of Body Worlds. His editorial in July
declared that he had no intention of seeing the show, which he
considers "the ultimate objectification and brutalization of the
human form. It seems but one step removed from cannibalism."</TE>
<TE>   In early August, Von Hagens invited British donors to come
forward, as they have in other countries where he has
exhibited--Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium--and offer their
bodies as future "plastinates." More than 20 people answered the
call, ages 17 to 70.</TE>
<TE>   "I will die very happy knowing my body will generate an
educational interest," said future donor Raymond Edwards, 51.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no shortage of bodies," Von Hagens said one evening as
people wandered around the exhibition. "But I thought it best to
present the British donors to the public so that they believe it's
not necessary for me to go and dig them up.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of the specimens I work with are bodies of those
who have consented to give them; the others are from collections
already used for research."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Von Hagens was involved in a controversy over whether
he was illegally sent body parts from a medical school in Siberia. He
denied it, saying he had signed a contract with the university to
plastinate and return bodies to the school for research.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the exhibition--who pay $15 admission--show no signs
of horror or disgust, instead spending minutes listening to audio
explanations, or gazing at dissected organs, often prodding
themselves as they follow a digestive tract or work out where their
liver is.</TE>
<TE>   Although the corpses are posed, Von Hagens stressed that he isn't
motivated by any artistic impulse.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a physician, an anatomist. But I am really by no means an
artist, because I never tried to create anything with the aim of
making it into a special form or shape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is, and always was, he said, to show the human body "in
its holistic aspects, total--I call it event anatomy. Therefore I
close the gap between the dead and the living by putting the
plastinated body into a position which is lifelike."</TE>
<TE>   In early exhibitions, he left the bodies in the traditional
upright, anatomical pose, but the public found the Frankenstein
stances dehumanizing, doll-like and frightening, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he studied the few existing examples of 16th century preserved
corpses and the anatomical drawings of Renaissance scholars such as
Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius, some of which are reproduced
as background for the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Every exhibit shows a different aspect of human machinery--the
brain, the digestive system, the backbone can be studied as single
pieces or in conjunction with the rest of the body.</TE>
<TE>   A figure on horseback holds out a human brain, twice the size of
the brain of the massive, muscular horse he is riding.</TE>
<TE>   "Beneath the skin, we are very similar to the horse," Von Hagens
said, adding that he is keen to continue his anatomy work comparing
the human to other animals. "I am already working on a gorilla, a
camel, and recently even worked on a whale."</TE>
<TE>   The only trouble with his approach, Von Hagens said, is that he is
now "dubbed as an artist." An understandable misconception,
perhaps--he habitually dresses in black and wears a black
broad-brimmed hat.</TE>
<TE>   His "exploded" versions of the human body, as he calls his
dissections, make for exciting, unusual forms and shapes. "Some
critics then say, 'He has transformed the human body into a totem
pole--he is an artist!' " Von Hagens said. "But I do it so I can have
a full view of the body inside and out, without taking anything
away."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing artistic in the audio and visual explanations of
the exhibition. Basic facts and statistics are given: The human
skeleton only weighs about 25 pounds, a body's veins and arteries
laid end to end are 56,000 miles long, and the largest and heaviest
organ of the human body is the skin.</TE>
<TE>   But in the world of science, Von Hagens said, he has critics who
view his lifelike body poses with suspicion, while many in the art
world applaud them.</TE>
<TE>   "I would certainly bring my students here," Zoltan Mihalik, a
27-year-old Hungarian medical teacher and anesthetist from Budapest
University Clinic, said after viewing the show. But he said the
lifelike poses aren't appropriate. "I can't help feeling that
someone's feelings could be hurt. To show figures playing chess or
riding a bicycle is not necessary."</TE>
<TE>   But some in the medical field are fans of the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Stolkin, a senior lecturer in anatomy at King's College
London, has been following Von Hagens' progress for some years. "It's
a fantastic exhibition," he said. "It's a great advance in the way
anatomy can be presented. The sectioning of the body parts is
unique--it's like the physical view of what CAT scanning shows."</TE>
<TE>   Stolkin has taken both medical students and art students to the
exhibition, "even people who are quite squeamish, and they all found
it fascinating ... not sensationalist nor gory."</TE>
<TE>   Von Hagens says his plastination method is an accepted form of
anatomical research that he has sold to 40 countries and 400
universities throughout the world. According to Body Worlds' press
materials, proceeds from the current exhibition go toward financing
plastination research.</TE>
<TE>   "My shows are always seen first by the medical students, who take
notes and come back. Then come the intellectuals and the artists, and
now," he said, looking at Britons from all walks of life wandering
round the exhibition, "come the ordinary people, men and women, even
with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, everyone has a body, and this is a walk through the
body."</TE>

conspiracy defendant Zacarias Moussaoui unless it receives assurances
that the material won't be used to secure a death penalty, Germany's
justice minister said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators suspect that Moussaoui, who awaits trial in Virginia
on charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism and murder federal
employees, was training to pilot one of the airliners hijacked for
the attacks when he was arrested.</LD>

<LD>Exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif withdrew his candidacy for
October's parliamentary elections and threw his support to ex-Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came a day after election officials in Bhutto's
home city of Larkana rejected her bid to run for a National Assembly
seat. Officials were scheduled to rule today on Bhutto's nomination
papers for two other seats.</LD>
<LD>   The officials had approved Sharif's candidacy, despite his deal
with current President Pervez Musharraf, who ousted him, to stay out
of the country until 2010.</LD>

<HD>EU May Seek Pact With U.S. on Court</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HELSINGOER, Denmark</DL>
<LD>The European Union showed a new willingness Saturday to compromise on
U.S. demands that it exempt Americans from prosecutions at the
international court on war crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Italy and Britain have already indicated that they are ready to
break ranks with their EU partners and sign bilateral deals granting
Washington's wish.</LD>
<LD>   Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said he will seek an
EU-wide accord by Sept. 30 to grant Americans immunity before the
International Criminal Court in any cases related to peacekeeping
operations.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration is concerned that Americans--politicians
and members of the military--could become targets of politically
motivated trials. It has said sparing Americans that fate could be
done under Article 98 of the International Criminal Court charter,
which deals with stationing troops in foreign nations.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would await the
outcome of Moeller's efforts. Earlier, Berlusconi, a staunch Bush
ally, had said Washington's request was a bilateral issue.</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw would not confirm reports
that his government was ready to sign an exemption with Washington.
But a British diplomat said the ICC charter "provides an avenue" for
such exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts of the 15 EU nations will meet Wednesday. The legal
advisors at the EU Commission have already said that exempting
Americans from war crimes prosecutions would not be legal under the
ICC treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Ending a two-day meeting, the 15 EU foreign ministers also
condemned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for flouting the
international community's long-standing demand that Baghdad readmit
U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Wary of Washington's talk of war, the EU foreign ministers said it
was up to the United Nations Security Council--not the Pentagon--to
force Hussein to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Moeller also said he will tour the Middle East this month with a
peace plan designed to lead to an independent Palestinian state by
2005. The first phase deals with stopping the Israeli-Palestinian
violence, the second with setting up temporary borders and the third
with settling the three largest obstacles: Jerusalem's status, the
return of Palestinian refugees and definitive borders.</TE>

<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>While the 45,000 delegates attending the World Summit on Sustainable
Development wrangled over how best to save the planet's rapidly
dwindling resources, they gave scant indication of leading by
example.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-day summit, which runs through Wednesday, is expected to
generate between 300 and 400 tons of trash, and so far, just 20% of
it is being recycled.</LD>
<LD>   "We never had any illusions this would be a green summit," Mary
Metcalfe, the environment minister of Gauteng province, which
includes Johannesburg, said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Conference toilets have been fitted with flushing systems to
minimize water use, and two venues staging summit fringe events are
running on renewable energy sources. However, recycling bins placed
in conference halls have ended up as replacement garbage cans, filled
with all sorts of non-recyclable waste.</TE>

<HD>Israel Kills 10 Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Copter missiles claim five lives. Also in the West
Bank, an attacker is slain. A day later, four people are shot to
death by troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Five Palestinians, including at least one fighter and two children,
were killed Saturday afternoon when an Israeli attack helicopter
fired missiles at a car in the West Bank town of Tubas, witnesses and
officials on both sides said.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, a Palestinian gunman attacked a Jewish settlement
Saturday, wounding a couple before he was shot dead. And this
morning, Israeli troops said they shot and killed four Palestinians
near the gravesite of a Jewish rabbi south of Hebron.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the Israeli army on Saturday captured the top political
leader in the West Bank of the radical Islamic movement Hamas.</LD>
<TE>   The violence came as about a million Palestinian children
attempted to reach classrooms on the first day of the new school
year. Many had to wait for hours at Israeli military checkpoints or
take back roads to evade them. In two Palestinian cities in the West
Bank, Jenin and Hebron, curfews kept children at home.</TE>
<TE>   In Tubas, a village about 12 miles south of Jenin, witnesses said
U.S.-supplied Apache helicopters from the Israeli air force launched
at least four missiles at a car driving through a residential
neighborhood. The Israeli military said several men wanted for
planning terrorist attacks were in the car.</TE>
<TE>   One suspect was killed but others escaped, the army and
Palestinian security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Raid Juma, a paramedic at the scene, said by telephone that three
occupants of the car were burned to death. They included a man
identified by officials as Rafah Daraghmeh, a member of the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with the Fatah movement of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The other two dead from the car were 18-year-olds believed also to
be members of Al Aqsa, Juma said. Several other militants riding in a
second car escaped unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   But one missile slammed into a nearby home, where collapsing walls
crushed to death two children: Usama Daraghmeh, 12, and his
8-year-old sister, Behira. A 12-year-old cousin was critically
wounded, according to Dr. Mohammed abu Ghali of Jenin Hospital, where
the child and several other people seriously hurt in the attack were
taken.</TE>
<TE>   The army said in a statement that it regretted any loss of
civilian life and that the airstrikes were carried out "within the
framework of [the army's] fight against terror." Israel's
controversial policy of hunting and killing suspects has resulted in
dozens of deaths, including those of a handful of passersby.</TE>
<TE>   After nightfall Saturday, a gunman purportedly from the Balata
refugee camp in nearby Nablus infiltrated the Jewish settlement of
Har Bracha, just to the south, and opened fire on settlers outside a
vacant religious school. The man seriously wounded a 23-year-old
pregnant Israeli and her husband before he was shot dead by security
forces, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small faction
allied with Fatah, reportedly claimed responsibility for the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Near the Palestinian village of Bani Naim, south of Hebron,
soldiers killed a group of four Palestinians and said they found a
saw and wire-cutting equipment on the bodies, indicating that the
group was planning to infiltrate a Jewish settlement in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces Saturday also captured the senior Hamas political
figure in the West Bank, Sheik Hassan Yousef, who was taken from his
hide-out in the city of Ramallah. Israel accuses him of inciting
Palestinians to attack Israelis, but Hamas said Yousef is just a
politician, and vowed revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has arrested thousands of Palestinians since reoccupying
the West Bank this year in the wake of a spate of suicide bombings.
Among those taken into custody have been top political leaders and
militiamen, including the senior Fatah official for the West Bank,
Marwan Barghouti, who went on public trial two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   A relative lull in the violence in the last several weeks has
convinced some Israelis that their tactics, including punishing
closures, are working. But others believe that groups such as Hamas
are just biding their time.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hamas and Al Aqsa were vowing revenge Saturday night, and a
senior Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, accused Israel of
undermining "all efforts aimed at reviving the hope for peace."</TE>

<HD>Governor's Race Is a Test Case for Japanese Reform</HD>
<DH>Asia: Maverick ousted by Nagano lawmakers for opposing
pork- barrel projects leads polls for today's vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAGANO, Japan</DL>
<LD>This mountainous prefecture that played host to the 1998 Winter
Olympics will be the scene of another epic event today: a political
showdown between an ousted reformer and the status quo.</LD>
<LD>   If the polls are right, residents will give a Bronx cheer to their
prefectural assembly and reelect the flamboyant governor, whom the
assembly booted in a no-confidence vote in July because of his
domineering style and opposition to popular pork-barrel dam projects.</LD>
<LD>   The widely watched election may be a bellwether for the rest of
Japan. Voters, frustrated with the glacial pace of change here, will
show whether they favor low-key leaders who operate within the system
in this consensus-oriented nation or a crusader intent on making
changes.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a moment when the litmus paper changes, and today's
moment is Nagano," said the ousted governor, Yasuo Tanaka, who has
taken his case for reinstatement to the people.</TE>
<TE>   If they back him, that might provide him with a mandate for
speedier change--or it could mean even more gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   For even if Tanaka is elected, the assembly will still be in
office until April--and it's not clear whether the members will
accept the public's mandate and cooperate with him.</TE>
<TE>   A well-known novelist and racy essayist with a penchant for flight
attendants and Versace leather, Tanaka made national and
international headlines with his radical style and opposition to the
public works spending that is one of the few things stimulating
depressed rural Japanese communities these days.</TE>
<TE>   An independent in a land dominated by old-guard politicians and
managed by entrenched bureaucrats, Tanaka was overwhelmingly elected
by Nagano voters in October 2000. (In contrast, reform-minded
Junichiro Koizumi of the Liberal Democratic Party was elected prime
minister by his peers in parliament, as the constitution dictates.)</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper surveys show Tanaka leading five opponents.</TE>
<TE>   While in office, Tanaka had residents singing out their views as
if in a karaoke club at the first-ever town meetings in rural hamlets
across the prefecture. He vowed to cut two dam projects that were
leveraging the prefecture's and nation's future with onerous debt.</TE>
<TE>   The glass office he built for himself in the lobby of the
prefectural headquarters, where gawking visitors and omnipresent
television cameras scrutinized everything down to his bento lunches,
became a metaphor for the kind of openness he wanted throughout the
government.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, that office is dark and deserted. On July 5, 20
months after he assumed office, Tanaka became only the second
Japanese governor since World War II to lose a vote of confidence in
an assembly. Legislators took action after he threatened to cancel
two dam projects the assembly had approved years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The assembly branded him as self-righteous and childish. He opted
to run for reinstatement, saying he wanted the people to determine
his fate.</TE>
<TE>   Satoshi Miyazawa, 26, an office worker from Asakawa, where a dam
construction project was proposed, is one supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "Until now, every Nagano governor was a prefectural bureaucrat,
but Tanaka was a fresh breeze from the private sector," Miyazawa
said. "Calling off the dam projects might be bad news for
construction companies. But for citizens, it's an environmental
issue, and I'm all for Tanaka's policy."</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka, 46, charges that many of the assembly members formerly
worked for construction companies or are openly supported by them.
The construction industry heavily backs the ruling LDP, and even in
Japan's most mountainous and out-of-the-way spots, the amount of
concrete and roads-to-nowhere is astounding.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroko Inadera, 38, a homemaker trying to adapt to Nagano's quiet
streets and minimal commerce after moving from bustling Osaka a year
ago, complained about the stagnant economy. Two major department
stores--branches of failed national chains--are shuttered, and the
streets are largely empty of pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "Tanaka is said to be autocratic and self-righteous, but that is
toward the assembly," she said before getting on her bicycle to
continue her errands. "He tries to listen to citizens, or at least
appears to on television."</TE>
<TE>   But Tanaka's overwhelming popularity began to erode the more he
tangled with the assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "Tanaka needs to listen more to people and change his ways," said
Makoto Kitamura, 53, a taxi driver awaiting customers one recent day.
"He can't be rejecting everything. If he doesn't make some
compromises and cooperate with the assembly, he's not going to get
anything done. He's not a politician, he's a novelist."</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka has apparently ushered in one change: He's inspired several
candidates who are neither seasoned politicians nor bureaucrats to
run against him. The most viable appears to be attorney Keiko
Hasegawa, 50, who branded Tanaka a dictator at a recent rally.
Hundreds of her supporters repeatedly cheered, "She's right,"
throughout the speech.</TE>
<TE>   Hasegawa noted that there were high hopes for Tanaka when he took
office, and cited one pundit who declared that "the alarm clock of
democracy rang" with his election.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we all woke up with this alarm clock," she continued.
"But Tanaka kept his alarm ringing and eventually irritated our ears
and heads. You can't solve anything with confrontation and confusion.
We need substantial debate and dialogue for real democracy."</TE>

<HD>Armed Attackers Kill 2 Americans in Papua</HD>
<DH>Asia: Militant separatists are suspected in the ambush, in
which an Indonesian also died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Two Americans and an Indonesian were killed Saturday when an armed
group ambushed a convoy of vehicles near a huge American-owned copper
and gold mine in the troubled province of Papua, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 14 other people were injured in the shooting, including
at least six Americans, four of them seriously, officials said.
Indonesian officials said some of the victims were teachers at an
international school near the Freeport Indonesia mine.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting took place on a road heavily patrolled by the
Indonesian military. Soldiers responded quickly and pledged to track
down the killers, said a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here.</LD>
<TE>   This morning, troops reported exchanging fire with a group of
unidentified men near the site of the attack. Military officials said
one member of the group, a Papuan, was killed and one soldier was
wounded in the leg.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown who was behind Saturday's assault, although some
officials suspected militant separatists who oppose Indonesia's
40-year rule in the province.</TE>
<TE>   "An armed group, whose identity is unclear, blocked the road and
then opened fire," Papua Police Chief Made M. Pastika told the
Reuters news service. "Those who died were two Americans and one
Indonesian."</TE>
<TE>   Papua, known until recently as Irian Jaya, makes up the western
half of the island of New Guinea. It is rich in resources such as
gold, timber and oil, but many of its 2.5 million people live in
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia annexed the province in 1969 after it staged a vote of
1,026 handpicked tribal chiefs. Many were held at gunpoint as they
voted unanimously to join Indonesia. An armed group known as the Free
Papua Movement has fought the Indonesian army for decades, but it has
generally been poorly equipped and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, Papua's most prominent opposition leader, Theys
Eluay, was abducted and slain. Twelve officers and soldiers from
Indonesia's feared special forces branch, Kopassus, have been
arrested in that killing.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the government renamed the province Papua and gave it
greater autonomy, but those moves have produced little enthusiasm
among indigenous Papuans, who make up more than half the population.
The government has intensified efforts to crack down on the
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The Freeport mine is the world's largest gold mine and is
Indonesia's biggest taxpayer. Owned by Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold
Inc. of New Orleans, it has become a symbol of Papua's exploitation
by outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its importance to the country's economy, it is guarded
by Kopassus soldiers. It was unclear whether soldiers were
accompanying the ambushed convoy.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Indonesia's regions, including Aceh, Sulawesi and the
Moluccas, have been the sites of continuing armed conflict, but
foreigners have rarely been targeted. In the past, Papua separatists
kidnapped several Americans but released them.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, United Nations aid worker Carlos Caceres of Puerto
Rico and two others were hacked to death in West Timor when a mob
attacked their offices.</TE>

<HD>Peaceful Protests Upstage U.N. Summit</HD>
<DH>Activism: Up to 10,000 march against globalism and other
concerns. Police presence is strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>As many as 10,000 protesters marched Saturday from a shantytown five
miles away to the plush suburban site of the U.N. environmental
summit here in a peaceful demonstration against globalization and
other concerns, hurling slogans and leaflets at journalists rather
than rocks at police.</LD>
<LD>   But demonstrators who had walked from the township of Alexandra
were confronted first by a phalanx of television cameras and then
forced to halt well outside the conference venue by concrete
barricades, razor wire and one of the largest assemblies of police in
this country since the end of apartheid.</LD>
<LD>   The marches were the biggest scheduled for a summit that is
expected to draw more than 100 heads of state and government to forge
plans aimed at reducing poverty while protecting the planet. For a
day, diplomatic haggling within the gathering was upstaged by
colorful street theater without: red-shirted demonstrators waving
flags and banners in front of a blue line of police in riot gear.</LD>
<TE>   "Those fat cats inside the convention center do not speak for us,"
shouted one leader through a bullhorn. "They are the exploiters. They
take over our electricity. They take over our water. Today, we must
fight repression ... George Bush and all of the capitalist leaders of
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Henriette Bester, a director of the Gauteng provincial police,
said Saturday's three permitted marches came off without serious
incident, except that one protester suffered a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We planned for the worst," Bester said in explaining the enormous
show of force, which included police dogs, helicopters and mounted
patrols plus the line of officers with riot shields.</TE>
<TE>   South African authorities have brought in 8,000 police from
surrounding provinces to bolster 19,000 in Johannesburg and establish
a wide perimeter around the convention center in the ritzy suburb of
Sandton, which will begin to receive world leaders today and Monday.
President Bush will not attend.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities wanted to make sure that the 10-day World Summit
on Sustainable Development, which ends Wednesday, did not fall victim
to the kind of anti-globalization protests that disrupted the 1999
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle or the pro-Palestinian
demonstrations that marred the conference on racism last year in
Durban, South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, members of Greenpeace and other environmental groups
marched in solidarity with the more moderate of the South African
demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   "While we support the issues, we do not support disrupting the
summit," said Michael Strauss, a spokesman for a coalition of
environmental and social activist groups. "This is not supposed to be
Seattle or Durban. We don't want the [Bush] administration to say,
'See, these conferences don't work.' This is the one constructive
forum we've got, and we want the world leaders to have a chance to do
the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the marchers seemed focused on anti-globalization and
pro-Palestinian efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Comrades, it's quite clear a new movement has arrived to South
Africa: anti-globalization," shouted one speaker in a red T-shirt.
"It's the rich. They want their hands on the oil of Angola. They want
their hands on the diamonds of the Congo, and they want their hands
on the copper of Zambia."</TE>
<TE>   Some South African Muslims marched carrying Palestinian flags and
wearing T-shirts emblazoned with anti-Israel, anti-Zionist slogans.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal Jassat, one Muslim marcher, was present when the Palestinian
Solidarity Committee disrupted a presentation on reforestation last
week by the Jewish National Fund. He said more such action is likely
when Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres arrives this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose he can expect a hot reception," Jassat said.</TE>
<TE>   Other demonstrators Saturday focused on a rainbow of issues,
ranging from barring U.S. food relief that includes genetically
modified corn to both supporting and opposing South Africa's ruling
party, the African National Congress, and President Robert Mugabe of
neighboring Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the Landless People's Movement lauded Mugabe's
seizures of land from white farmers, which has brought him
international notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   "You are a lion, Mugabe, you are a lion," they chanted in the Zulu
language. "You are a hero, Mugabe, you are a hero. The land must be
taken."</TE>
<TE>   But one speaker later corrected the marchers.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not support Robert Mugabe ... because he is a dictator, he
kills people in Zimbabwe. He does not allow free speech."</TE>

<HD>6 Sentenced to Death for Rape in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Crime: A village council had ordered the attack on a woman
as penalty in a tribal dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DERA GHAZI KHAN, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani court early today sentenced six men to death by hanging
in the case of a woman who was gang-raped on the orders of a
traditional village council. Eight others were acquitted in a case
that highlighted the abuse of women in rural areas.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was not present when the court announced the decision
amid heavy security. She said Friday that members of her family had
been threatened with death if the men were convicted.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyer Mohammed Yaqub said four of the men were sentenced
to death for committing the rape and two others for serving on the
village council that authorized it. "We will appeal," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Yaqub named the four sentenced to death for the rape as Allah
Ditta, Abdul Khaliq, Fayyaz Hussain and Ghulam Farid. The two on the
council were Faiz Bakhsh and Ramzan Bichar, he said. Each was also
fined more than $600.</TE>
<TE>   All eight who were acquitted had also served on the council.
Bakhsh and Bichar were the most vocal council members in arguing for
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she was raped by four men after approaching the
traditional council in Meerwala to settle a dispute with the rival
Mastoi clan.</TE>
<TE>   She said she went to the council after her 11-year-old brother was
kidnapped and sodomized by members of the Mastoi tribe, who accused
him of having an illicit affair with one of their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The council ruled that to save Mastoi honor, the boy should marry
the girl with whom he was linked, while his sister, who is divorced,
was to be given away in marriage to a Mastoi man.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution said that when she rejected the decision she was
gang-raped by the four Mastoi men and made to walk home nearly naked
in front of hundreds of people.</TE>
<TE>   Her elder brother said the family was satisfied with the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "They committed a big crime against my sister, and the decision
was according to our expectations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Mastoi clan were visibly upset by the ruling. In a
daylong vigil before the verdict was announced, hundreds of clan
members, mostly relatives of the defendants, stood outside in a light
rain and prayed for an acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   Armed police were stationed throughout the Punjab province town of
Dera Ghazi Khan, where hundreds of members of the victim's family
also had gathered.</TE>
<TE>   The woman remained in Meerwala, where police beefed up security
around her home Saturday.</TE>

<DL>STOCKHOLM</DL>
<LD>A Swedish man of Tunisian origin who was arrested with a gun in his
carry-on luggage once attended a U.S. flight school, a top security
official and the suspect's lawyer said Saturday. But the lawyer
denied that the suspect was planning a hijacking.</LD>
<LD>   The 29-year-old suspect, identified by his lawyer as Kerim Chatty,
was being held on a preliminary charge of planning to hijack a plane
and illegal possession of a firearm after he was detained Thursday at
Vaesteraas airport in eastern Sweden. Police said he had been on his
way to an Islamic conference in Birmingham, England.</LD>
<LD>   Margareta Linderoth, director of the national security police,
said authorities were investigating links to terrorist groups. But
she denied a report that the suspect was planning to crash the
aircraft into a U.S. Embassy in Europe or that they were looking for
four men connected to such a plan.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Nils Uggla said his client, whose father is from
Tunisia and mother from Sweden, has denied any plans to hijack the
plane and can explain why he carried a gun in a toiletries bag. Uggla
would not be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Linderoth said Chatty took pilot training at a school in the
United States but did not complete the course and did not get a
license.</TE>
<TE>   Uggla said his client was being unfairly portrayed because of his
religion and the proximity of the anniversary of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "He is Muslim, he is flying and he has a gun and it's close to 11
of September," Uggla said. "That makes people draw quick
conclusions."</TE>

<DH>Reaction: America's unilateralism has eroded the post-Sept.
11 global solidarity as nations grow disillusioned, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>On Sept. 12, Le Monde newspaper printed a headline for the ages: "We
are all Americans."</LD>
<LD>   Such sentiment in France, whose Le Monde-reading elite tends to
snipe at American politicians even as it consumes American products,
epitomized a global outpouring of sympathy for the United States
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In the following months, former foes and staunch allies backed
what the United States called the war on terrorism. They generally
regarded it as a smart, methodical campaign that did the world a
service by toppling Afghanistan's Taliban regime and dismantling the
Al Qaeda terrorist network base there. U.S. pressure combined with
the horror of Sept. 11 to spur many countries to confront festering
problems of Islamic extremism, border security and transnational
crime.</LD>
<TE>   The aftermath brought international transformations such as a
remarkable U.S.-Russian partnership. The realpolitik of the war on
terrorism created instant winners (Israel), forlorn losers (Latin
America) and unlikely allies (Pakistan).</TE>
<TE>   But in many ways and in many places, the attacks did not change
the world. The post-Sept. 11 period of solidarity appears to have
dissipated, a mere pause in a steady rise of disillusionment with the
world's only remaining superpower, according to interviews conducted
by Times correspondents around the world.</TE>
<TE>   With a few important exceptions, foreign leaders and voters say
the U.S. may have missed a historic opportunity to forge a broad
international coalition and revamp its increasingly negative image.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an all-time high splash of pro-American sentiment after
Sept. 11," said Yuri A. Levada, director of VTSIOM, one of Russia's
main polling groups. "But we soon saw that America didn't know what
to do with all the support it was getting from all over the world,
including Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Today, critics accuse the U.S. of aggressive unilateralism.
Rightly or wrongly, they regard the Bush administration--with the
notable exception of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell--as a
caricature of arrogance. They cite President Bush's "axis of evil"
speech, the legal limbo of the prisoners in U.S. military custody at
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, American opposition to an international
criminal court and environmental treaty, and, most prominently, the
current war of words on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. marches alone against Iraq, it might find itself with
fewer friends than in a long time, according to the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. thinks it can fight any country that disobeys its rule,"
said Wu Wei, 35, a Chinese journalist. "But the truth is that no
country can rule the world.... If the U.S. doesn't modify its current
policies, more Americans will be sacrificed for the wrongheaded
policies of the U.S. government."</TE>
<TE>   As always, the America-bashing must be examined carefully and in
context. It seems almost ritualistic to blow off steam with rhetoric
while quietly cooperating with and benefiting from U.S. policies.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Americanism is a familiar and tricky phenomenon, according to
Chris Brown, a professor of international relations at the London
School of Economics. Brown said Europeans react superficially to
issues such as the saber-rattling on Iraq, failing to recognize that
the debate in Washington is more sophisticated than critics would
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an ambiguous view of America in the world anyway," Brown
said. "Everybody criticizes it, but the people who criticize it most
virulently are the same ones who want to go and work there."</TE>
<TE>   The United States still enjoys the allegiance of allies from
Britain to Japan, Italy to Australia. Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi declared with characteristic effusiveness last year: "I
love America. I am on whatever side America is on, even before I know
what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Probably more than any nation, Israel remains a staunch friend of
America. Israelis also see themselves fighting a war on terrorism,
even if Palestinians and some Israeli dissenters say the analogy is
flawed. Israeli support grew during the last year as the Bush
administration sided overwhelmingly with Israel in the conflict with
the Palestinian Authority and all but abandoned Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Israel may be unique in that it actually encourages an
invasion of Iraq--"the sooner the better," as government officials
put it. The conservative Jerusalem Post recently proclaimed that
Bush's hard line on Iraq puts him "at the cusp of greatness."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, unexpected solidarity came from a formidable former
enemy. The first world leader to call Bush with condolences was
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. The phone call set up a sea
change in the relationship. Amid consternation and grief, the world
almost took for granted the unexpected transformation in U.S.
relations with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Putin embraced the war on terrorism. His acceptance of U.S. troops
on former Soviet soil in Uzbekistan and other parts of Central Asia
was an enormous geopolitical shift. It marked the end of Russia's
domination of a region that it has considered its backyard since the
days of the "Great Game," when the Russian and British empires
competed there for influence two centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, pro-American sentiment among Russians shot up,
according to polls: 74% of the population was positive, and only 10%
was sharply anti-American. By February, however, Russian goodwill had
sunk to 48%, and it continues to fluctuate.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-line conservatives in the Russian security forces and
bureaucracy are alarmed by the U.S. presence in Central Asia and want
to reverse Putin's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The old establishment ... is full of old, conservative thinking,"
said Liliya F. Shevtsova, an analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center
think tank, noting that ordinary Russians are more sympathetic. "The
people have turned out to be more reasonable than the elite."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the attitude on the "Arab street" remains resolutely
cold. It is usually difficult to generalize about the Arab world
because of its diversity, but when it comes to America, there seems
to be near universal agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Distrust of America is pervasive, particularly in a nation such as
Jordan, where more than half the population is ethnically
Palestinian. Many Arabs simply don't believe that Osama bin Laden was
behind the Sept. 11 attacks. Instead, they believe that Israel
carried out the attacks to undermine the Palestinian uprising, and
they view America's war on terrorism as part of a broad Zionist
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   In Jordan and Egypt, two of the United States' closest allies in
the region, there is a general sense that Washington squandered any
sympathy dividend. Though many Arabs were upset by the number of
civilian casualties in the attacks, there is a widespread belief that
the U.S. had it coming and that a chastened America would evaluate
its Middle East policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has exploited 9/11 for its own agendas," said Maha
Mohammed, 26, a student counselor at an American school in Cairo.
"Fighting terrorism has become this license to do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Many Arabs also believe that Israel now acts with impunity.
Throughout the Arab world, people still repeat as fact the rumor that
thousands of Jews didn't show up for work at the World Trade Center
on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the U.S. anti-terrorism campaign has enlisted unlikely
allies: some of Israel's worst enemies. Although Syria remains on the
State Department's list of terrorism sponsors, Syrian security forces
have helped capture and interrogate Al Qaeda suspects. Pakistan's
regime is another unexpected ally struggling against the nation's own
widespread anti-Americanism and potent fundamentalist groups.</TE>
<TE>   It may be more disconcerting to hear anti-American vitriol from
nominal friends such as the South Koreans. Although the South Korean
government has unequivocally committed itself to aiding the U.S.
against terrorism, it is common to hear the "man on the street"
praise Bin Laden and say America has itself to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy," a high school student from Kwangju, South Korea,
wrote to Bush about the terrorist attacks for an English class
assignment. "Because of that accident that broke out, Americans say,
'Ha. Ha. Ha. We are heroes. We love peace.' In fact, it's [a] lie.
They love war and power and money."</TE>
<TE>   South Korean anti-Americanism intensified after Bush included
North Korea in his axis-of-evil speech, offending South Koreans who
believe that present-day North Korea is more to be pitied than
condemned.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Latin Americans fear that they have all but
dropped off the maps in Washington. The reformist government of
Mexican President Vicente Fox had especially high hopes dashed; when
Bush took office, he made Mexico a priority.</TE>
<TE>   Days before the terrorist attacks, Fox visited Bush and made great
strides toward an accord that would make Mexican immigration to the
United States safer and more orderly. Fox asked Washington to grant
legal status to some of the millions of undocumented Mexicans who
work in the United States and preferential visa status to aspiring
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's vision of a more open border understandably fell victim to
national security imperatives after Sept. 11. In a speech in New York
to the Council of Americas in May, he said the lack of progress on
the Mexican agenda in Washington was preventing Mexico from taking a
more powerful role in crises in Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "In these difficult times," Fox said, "Latin America seems to have
been abandoned to its fate."</TE>
<TE>   European governments worry that the U.S. will isolate itself by
ignoring them. Perhaps nowhere is America's lost moral capital more
obvious than in Germany, a nation lifted by U.S. generosity from the
vanquished devastation after World War II to become a global economic
power and a democratic paragon.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. citizens, from the lowest-ranking GI to the visionary
statesmen of the Cold War era, have been widely revered in Germany.
But even some of Washington's oldest admirers are now shaking their
heads over the aggressive drumbeat against Iraq and U.S. refusals to
abide by international judicial, trade and environmental agreements.</TE>
<TE>   German politicians have indulged in U.S.-bashing during a closely
fought election season. The U.S. economy is depicted by all
candidates as an example of corporate greed prevailing over an
enslaved and insecure work force. When German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder wants to discredit his pro-business opponent, Bavarian Gov.
Edmund Stoiber, he accuses him of seeking to impose "American labor
standards" on Germans.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. managers line their pockets while the workers placed in
their trust are being laid off," Schroeder told an election rally in
Berlin late last month. In Germany, he said, "no one is forced to be
the slave of another."</TE>
<TE>   And in France, the traditional tension between resentment and
admiration of the United States manifested itself in dueling books
dedicated to Sept. 11. First came "The Horrifying Fraud"
[L'Effroyable Imposture] by Thierry Meyssan, which spins the
conspiracy theory that the terrorist attacks were actually the work
of a fiendish U.S. military-industrial cabal intent on a clandestine
takeover of power. Although Meyssan has been dismissed as a crackpot,
the book topped best-seller lists in France for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In response, two French journalists went to Washington to debunk
Meyssan's theories, including his claim that the plotters faked the
plane attack on the Pentagon and used a guided missile instead. They
published a book called "The Horrifying Lie."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the debate, complaints and worries, the aftermath of Sept.
11 pushed European politics decidedly to the right during the last
year. European governments, and many others, recognize the stark
realities produced by unmatched U.S. military might, whether they
like it or not.</TE>
<TE>   "The European emotional response to what happened Sept. 11 is
obviously fading away, which is, I would say, natural because time
goes on," said former Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an
expert at the Center for International Relations in Warsaw. "What is
really at stake is the nature of the European-U.S. relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "To put it in a slightly different fashion, will the U.S. need
Europe? Europe will need the United States. But whether it will be
reciprocal is a big question."</TE>

<HD>Cathedral to Open for Challenged Church</HD>
<DH>Dedication offers time to reflect on demands of enormous,
diverse population.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of lavishing his attention on the new Cathedral of Our
Lady of Angels, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony recently put the matter into
blunt perspective. Asked if the cathedral marked the most significant
achievement of his 17-year tenure as archbishop of Los Angeles, the
cardinal dismissed it as no more than a "footnote."</LD>
<LD>   "It is," Mahony said, "just a building."</LD>
<LD>   For him and many others, Monday's cathedral dedication will be a
celebration of the living church and the 5 million Roman Catholics
who constitute Southern California's largest religious group.</LD>
<TE>   From the strawberry fields of Santa Maria to the fishing docks of
San Pedro, across a rainbow of ethnic groups and every conceivable
economic class, the archdiocese of Los Angeles is a study of dynamic
growth, dazzling diversity and daunting challenges.</TE>
<TE>   It is a church revived and enriched by immigrants and challenged
by the need to accommodate more than 50 cultures and languages. On
any given Sunday, a cacophony of prayers is being raised in the
archdiocese's 287 parishes--in Nigeria's Ebo, in Pacific islands'
Samoan and Tongan and in near-ubiquitous Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of the archdiocese's Catholics are Latino and
Asian--and Asian Catholics now outnumber whites, according to
archdiocesan projections based on census data.</TE>
<TE>   It's a church squeezed between an exploding population and a
shrinking priesthood. That disparity has raised to a critical level
the question of empowering the laity to take on broader ministerial
roles--a sharp change in a parish culture traditionally ruled
exclusively by priests.</TE>
<TE>   It's a church soiled by sex scandals and sanctified by service to
society's forsaken--one of the few institutions in Southern
California working to tie together rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade or two, many say, the church has refocused on
its historic social mission as unprecedented immigration has brought
another great wave of newcomers--many of them poor and
dispossessed--to its doors.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a church whose booming growth from immigration masks
the presence of great masses of merely nominal Catholics and a
significant generational ebbing. Though 74% of Latino immigrants are
Catholics, only 59% of their grandchildren belong, according to
preliminary findings from a national study on Latinos and religion by
Pew Charitable Trusts.</TE>
<TE>   Near Pico Boulevard in central Los Angeles, St. Thomas the Apostle
Church is packed with 8,000 parishioners, prompting the church to
double its capacity in its current building renovation. But far more
potential members never show up, according to St. Thomas' pastor,
Father Jarlath Cunnane. He says census data suggest that as many as
39,000 Catholics live within his parish boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Similar challenges confront other U.S. dioceses: Some are facing
more dire priest shortages, others are experiencing less turbulent
demographic changes and a handful are experimenting with reforms to
empower the laity. But many Catholics look to the Los Angeles church
to provide national leadership on these issues, as the largest and
most diverse American diocese rooted not in the traditional East, but
in the innovative West.</TE>
<TE>   A demographic snapshot of the three-county Los Angeles archdiocese
underscores the challenges. In the last two decades, the Catholic
population in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has
nearly doubled from 2.2 million in 1981 to 4.1 million in 2001,
according to the Official Catholic Directory. (The archdiocese has
estimated its total population at 5 million.) With high levels of
immigration from heavily Catholic nations in Latin America and the
Philippines, the church claims 37.5% of this region, up from 28% two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, the number of active diocesan priests
has steadily declined. There were 418 last year, 77 fewer than in
1981, essentially doubling the ratio of Catholics to priests.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many priests are ministering to far more complex
congregations than before. At St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in Rowland
Heights, for instance, Msgr. Michael F. Killeen has seen his church
grow from 1,700 families when he arrived two decades ago to 5,000
families today, and a predominantly Anglo congregation transformed
into one dominated by Filipinos, Latinos and Chinese. There are
Masses in Spanish and Mandarin, and festivities surrounding Our Lady
of Guadalupe, Chinese New Year and such Filipino traditions as
Sambang Gabi: nine Masses leading up to Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   The new diversity "is a beautiful gift to the church," said
Killeen, an Irish immigrant. "It gives us a sense of the universality
of church, which is what the word 'catholic' means."</TE>
<TE>   But the diversity is not without its challenges. Some grumble
about the clumsiness of multilingual liturgies and the complexity of
dealing with numerous groups' respective leaderships, special feast
days and worship styles. Korean immigrants have compelled the church
to reshape its administrative structures because they bring a strong
tradition of lay leadership stemming from the scarcity of clergy in
the Korean church until recent years. All of the archdiocese's 13
Korean centers have elected lay leaders who help the pastor run the
parish, according to Father Alex Chung of St. Gregory Nazianzen in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Altadena, repeated attempts to blend Spanish, Vietnamese and
English speakers into one midnight Christmas liturgy ultimately fell
apart when the Vietnamese community decided it preferred its own
tradition of an earlier Mass to leave room for gift-giving customs,
according to St. Thomas the Apostle's Cunnane, who was previously the
Altadena church's pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the parish felt that we should all be together at
Christmas, but we let it go," Cunnane said. "It's always a challenge
to balance the desires for unity and diversity."</TE>
<TE>   People like Father Michael Kennedy of Dolores Mission in Boyle
Heights welcome the way immigrants have helped the church refocus on
the poor as a central ministry. Two decades ago, Kennedy, a bearded
Jesuit, was one of the first in town to offer sanctuary for
Salvadoran refugees--a controversial move at a time when U.S. foreign
policy supported a rightist government in El Salvador's civil war.
Today, many more parishes have embraced the cause of exploited
immigrants, low-wage workers and other dispossessed.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, asked to name his proudest achievement, cited efforts to
help immigrants, including a program that he says registered more
people for amnesty than any other agency in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the church played a pioneering role in fighting for the
poor and oppressed during waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th
centuries, many say that mission receded as Catholics became accepted
in the middle-class mainstream after World War II. According to
Auxiliary Bishop Edward Clark, who presides over the central Los
Angeles region, the church subsequently began focusing mostly on
religious and educational programs.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is credited with helping to revitalize the Los Angeles
church's social mission with several initiatives: an educational
foundation to provide grants for needy children to attend Catholic
schools, an annual fund-raising appeal to share the wealth among rich
and poor churches, and critical interventions that helped resolve
bitter labor disputes involving janitors and workers at Catholic
hospitals. His demonstrated commitment to the poor is one reason many
were startled by the $200-million price tag for the new cathedral
complex.</TE>
<TE>   At the parish level, several affluent congregations are forming
sister relationships with less wealthy ones in what church members
call "a holy exchange of gifts." The nomenclature reflects broad
changes in the last few decades, from a more paternalistic view of
helping the poor to today's spirit of being transformed by them.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, for instance, St. Mel Church in Woodland Hills
offered $45,000 in extra fund-raising to Our Lady of Victory Church
in Compton; the inner-city church reciprocated by sending its youths
to preach. And Clark, the auxiliary bishop, said churches in his
region--which ranges from struggling downtown neighborhoods to posh
Pacific Palisades--recently agreed to join forces to rebuild St.
Patrick parish in South-Central Los Angeles, which had crumbled in an
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "This consciousness would never have been in the church 10 years
ago," said Kennedy of Dolores Mission. "We are really becoming a
church that is ... a lot more aware that we don't have all the
answers."</TE>
<TE>   The church has yet to find an answer to what Msgr. Clement
Connolly of Holy Family Church in South Pasadena calls an impending
"Eucharistic famine"--a lack of priests to administer the church's
central act of worship. Although few clerics call for an end to bans
on women and married priests, few seem to believe that the answer to
the shortage of priests can be solved in traditional ways.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, only seven diocesan priests were ordained for Los
Angeles. The archdiocese regularly receives priests from South Korea
and Samoa to serve immigrants, but importing clerics is not seen as
an ultimate solution, for cultural reasons and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The most dominant cry is for empowering the laity to take on ever
greater roles in the ministry of the church.</TE>
<TE>   On the recent feast day of St. Monica, for instance, Msgr. Lloyd
Torgerson of St. Monica Church in Santa Monica invited a female lay
member to deliver "reflections" on the church's patron saint--a
perspective from a wife and mother that Torgerson could not provide.</TE>
<TE>   He followed that with his own remarks, in keeping with Vatican
rules that say laypeople are not to deliver homilies.</TE>
<TE>   At Holy Family, Connolly says the laity have claimed a range of
duties, including parish administrator and director of liturgy.
Breaking with a reliance on traditional rectories, the parish has
bought condominiums to equip it for any future ministerial
developments, including married or women priests.</TE>
<TE>   And some priests, like Father Stan Bosch of Our Lady of Victory
church in Compton, have surrendered decision-making power to lay
committees on how to spend charitable donations.</TE>
<TE>   Many say there is still a long way to go: Father David O'Connell,
for instance, said the laity must have more authority to hold priests
and bishops accountable--an issue that has come into focus during
scandals over clergy sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no one seems sure how to precisely structure the changes.</TE>
<TE>   They are expected to be hashed out in the archdiocese's current
initiative, known as the synod process, to bring together the clergy,
religious leadership and laity in local, regional and archdiocesan
meetings to set pastoral priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony launched the formal reexamination--the first in 40 years,
and the first to fully involve the laity--two years ago after issuing
a pastoral letter on lay ministry; it is set for completion next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are calling the laity to service of the church in a way that
has not been done before--to new positions of decision-making and
leadership," said Torgerson, a member of the synod committee.</TE>
<TE>   Many active Catholics also say they see a pressing need for
greater evangelization to bring the church into the streets and into
the lives of those who appear to be dropping away from the faith.</TE>
<TE>   Many congregations have created small, intimate groups within the
parish to meet regularly to pray, read Scripture, share personal
faith journeys and train lay leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The model comes from Latin America, another mark of the region's
influence on the Los Angeles church.</TE>
<TE>   At Dolores Mission in Boyle Heights, the groups are working with
law enforcement officials to improve policing, while Bosch's
parishioners participated in a rally last week to protest funding
cuts at the only public hospital serving the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The future of the church is in smaller communities," said Bosch.
"We see great power when people know each other's names."</TE>
<TE>   Much of this kind of discussion dissatisfies orthodox Catholics,
who believe the otherwise noble focus on the church's social mission
has left its spiritual one deeply neglected.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Zehnder, editor of the orthodox Los Angeles Lay
Catholic Mission newspaper, said few Catholics seem to even know the
tenets of their faith--the nature of the Eucharist as the literal
body and blood of Jesus, for instance--or to bother to follow the
teachings they know, such as bans on artificial birth control.</TE>
<TE>   Zehnder said that few clerics, including Mahony, are effectively
using the bully pulpit to teach parishioners the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "A large number of people are leaving the church because they are
not given reasons to stay," he said. "They stumble to Mass, receive
Communion and have no sense of what being Catholic is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Many others, however, seem imbued with a sense of rare opportunity
to shape Catholic Los Angeles into a cutting-edge model.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the institution has been broken down by scandal, and in some
ways this has given us the space to rethink who we are," O'Connell
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time to do it. If we don't do it now, we probably
never will."</TE>

<HD>Virtuoso on the Vibraphone, One of the Last Giants of Jazz</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lionel Hampton, the irrepressible bandleader who played with an
infectious joy that captivated fans around the world and, in the
process, gave the vibraphone a lasting place on the jazz bandstand,
died Saturday morning at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City.
He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health for several years after a series of strokes,
Hampton was admitted to the hospital Wednesday. The cause of death
was heart failure, said his manager, Phil Leshin.</LD>
<LD>   A dynamic showman with an electric personality, Hampton was one of
the last giants of jazz. He spent many of his formative musical years
in Los Angeles, playing with top local bands and some great national
figures as they came through town. Among them were Louis
Armstrong--who first encouraged him to play the vibraphone--and,
later, Benny Goodman.</LD>
<TE>   Hampton went to New York City with Goodman and became part of the
first openly integrated performing band, which also included drummer
Gene Krupa and pianist Teddy Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   As a bandleader in his own right, Hampton was a major influence on
a generation of players who would become leading names in jazz. Among
them were Clifford Brown, Betty Carter, Dexter Gordon, Illinois
Jacquet, Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Wes Montgomery and a young
singer from Chicago who called herself Ruth Jones, until Hampton told
her to change her name to Dinah Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Quincy Jones, now a multi-Grammy Award-winning producer, first
worked for Hampton in 1948 when he was just 15. He credits Hampton as
one of the people who gave him his start in music. He issued a
statement Saturday in Los Angeles on Hampton's passing:</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to find the words to describe the deep sadness
that I have today. In our more than 50-year relationship ... Lionel
Hampton was a mentor, collaborator and friend to me. Hamp was the
consummate jazz artist.... I cut my teeth writing arrangements for
Lionel Hampton, and there was no better school in the world than the
Lionel Hampton Orchestra. He taught me how to groove and how to laugh
and how to hang and how to live like a man."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' efforts to play for Hampton in 1948 were ultimately foiled
by the bandleader's wife, who sent the teenager back to school in
Seattle. In 1950, Jones rejoined Hampton's orchestra as an arranger
and trumpeter. He wrote his first composition, "Kingfish," and toured
with the band throughout the South and in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton was among the first blacks to play at a presidential
inauguration--Harry Truman's in 1949--and played at several other
inaugurals after that. In 1981, he was honored at the White House by
President Reagan; years later, he returned to be celebrated by
President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Through all of it, Hampton once said, he had just one goal: "I
want to be remembered for spreading happiness and goodwill." Over the
years, observers said he did just that.</TE>
<TE>   "So far as there is joy in jazz, he personified it," one critic,
Nat Hentoff, said Saturday. "He meant it and he felt it."</TE>
<TE>   Hampton's age, date of birth and place of birth were open to
question throughout his career. But in his autobiography, "Hamp,"
written with James Haskins, Hampton said he had been born on April
20, 1908, in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton was raised in Chicago by his grandparents and an uncle.
For school, he was sent to Holy Rosary Academy in Collins, Wis.,
where he learned the rudiments of band drumming from nuns.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to Chicago, he was greatly influenced by his
uncle, Richard Morgan, a well-known bootlegger who threw some of the
best parties and attracted some of the top jazz and blues stars of
the day.</TE>
<TE>   It was not uncommon for young Hampton to encounter such notables
as Alberta Hunter, Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver and Bessie
Smith--and occasionally white musicians such as Bix Biederbecke--at
his uncle's parties, which often turned into all-night jam sessions.</TE>
<TE>   His uncle encouraged Hampton's musical interest and young Lionel
played drums in a boys band organized by the Defender, one of the
city's leading black newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton developed quickly as a musician and learned to play by
ear. By his second year in high school, he was playing professionally
in a band led by saxophonist Les Hite, who later encouraged Hampton
to join him in Los Angeles, in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1920s, Los Angeles was a hotbed of jazz, with a lively
club scene and fine regional bands. Hampton, still a drummer in those
days, studied musical theory at USC, and played with a few local
bands, including one fronted by Hite at the Cotton Club, a Culver
City nightspot across from MGM. The club's owner hired Armstrong to
come in for an engagement in 1930, with a plan to use Hite's band to
accompany him. Hampton, Armstrong and the rest of the Hite band went
into the studio to cut a record.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the recording session, Hampton and Armstrong
came across what Hampton's autobiography referred to as a vibraharp
in a side room, and Armstrong asked Hampton if he could play it.
Hampton later wrote that he thought the keyboard was similar to that
of a xylophone, which he had studied in Chicago, and told Armstrong
he could.</TE>
<TE>   According to his autobiography, Hampton pulled the instrument into
the studio, plugged it in and played a solo that he had memorized
from one of Armstrong's records. As the story goes, Armstrong was
knocked out by the sound of the vibraphone and told Hampton he wanted
the younger musician to play the instrument on the Eubie Blake song
"Memories of You." Forty-five minutes later on that October day in
1930, Hampton, according to most experts, first played a vibraharp as
a serious instrument on a jazz recording.</TE>
<TE>   Through the rest of the year, Hampton continued his Cotton Club
work and did some additional recordings with Armstrong, playing both
drums and vibraharp. Live broadcasts from the club helped his
standing in the California jazz community, and Hampton got steady
work up and down the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton met Gladys Neal, a young woman who worked at MGM, in 1929,
and she became his steady companion, then his business manager and
later his wife. By all accounts, she was a formidable businesswoman
who kept a close eye on the money coming in and the money going out.
She handled his business affairs so astutely with investments in real
estate around the country that he eventually became a wealthy man.</TE>
<TE>   She also gave his career some focus, urging him to buy a set of
vibes and start his own group. By the mid-1930s, Hampton was fronting
his own band but, as the Depression, deepened the band wasn't doing
all that well financially.</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, the group was working at the Paradise Cafe, a jazz spot
on 6th and Main streets in downtown Los Angeles, when the influential
jazz producer John Hammond came in to hear Hampton play the vibes.
Benny Goodman and his orchestra were in town for a two-week
engagement, and the next night Hammond persuaded Goodman to visit the
club to hear Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman liked what he heard, and returned with drummer Krupa and
pianist Wilson. A jam session ensued, and Goodman hired Hampton,
forming the distinctive Benny Goodman Quartet that was the
orchestra's slick display piece.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, Hampton was recording with Goodman, Wilson and Krupa
at a Los Angeles studio. It was the first Benny Goodman quartet
recording; by the time Hampton joined the others in New York, the
record was selling briskly across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Hampton had a tremendous sense of rhythm, and he transferred that
to the vibes," said Dan Morgenstern, director of the Institute for
Jazz Studies at Rutgers University. "He could really swing, and
that's what captured Benny Goodman. He had a great ear and could
improvise."</TE>
<TE>   Hampton made his debut with Goodman's quartet at the Madhattan
Room of the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York City on Nov. 21, 1936.
Some observers predicted that race riots would ensue to block the
performance of an integrated band, but the only noticeable public
outcry was in the demand for tickets for subsequent concerts. The
quartet later moved to the larger Paramount Theater and played to
packed crowds for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton spent four years with Goodman, and recorded extensively
with the quartet. He also occasionally played in the big band, taking
over on drums after Krupa left Goodman in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   While with Goodman, Hampton made a number of memorable records for
RCA Victor with some of the leading names from big bands coming
through New York City. These Hampton small-group recordings, done in
the late 1930s, are considered by jazz critics to be among the finest
of their kind.</TE>
<TE>   When Goodman broke up the quartet in 1940, Hampton went out on his
own and formed a big band. Hampton's band was an immediate
crowd-pleaser that featured raw, energetic solos, a powerful brass
section and dominating saxophones.</TE>
<TE>   The driving excitement of the Hampton band was never greater than
when it played his theme, "Flyin' Home." During one frenzied
rendition of the tune at Harlem's Apollo Theater, the audience's
stomping created a crack in the balcony, ending the performance.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton's joyful grunting and unrestrained, swinging vibes style
became known by jazz fans throughout the world. He toured Europe and
Japan and other countries around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   When he visited Israel, he was inspired to write a four-part
symphonic jazz work, "King David," reflecting his spiritual
attachment to the infant nation.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton penned his signature tune "Flyin' Home" while he was
playing with Goodman in 1937. Other memorable compositions include
his original ballad "Midnight Sun," written with Sonny Burke, and his
"Blues Suite."</TE>
<TE>   Although the band was highly successful and, by the end of the
1940s, was grossing a million dollars annually, changing national
tastes in music meant that Hampton eventually had to settle for a
smaller group. In the mid-1960s, he began to travel with an
eight-piece combo that he called the Inner Circle.</TE>
<TE>   While a strong supporter of human rights causes, including an end
to apartheid in South Africa, Hampton did not fit into any commonly
accepted political mold.</TE>
<TE>   He was a staunch Republican, but supported President Johnson, a
Democrat, after Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1964. In
California in the 1940s, he supported a young congressional candidate
named Richard M. Nixon, played at rallies for him, and would continue
to support him throughout Nixon's political career. In 1980, he was
one of six New York state delegates elected to support George H.W.
Bush for the Republican presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Tragedy befell Hampton in 1997, when he lost most of his vast
collection of memorabilia, his music, photographs and vintage record
collection in a fire at his high-rise apartment in New York City.
Undaunted, two days later he arrived at the White House wearing a
borrowed suit to receive the National Medal of Arts from President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush issued a statement Saturday saying, "He was an
American music legend and will be sorely missed."</TE>
<TE>   Hampton received numerous awards over his long career, including a
jazz masters fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in
1988 and the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, the music school of the University of Idaho was named in
his honor. It annually presents a four-day Lionel Hampton jazz
festival at its campus in Moscow, Idaho. Pepperdine University is
just one of many educational institutions to give Hampton an honorary
degree.</TE>
<TE>   One of Hampton's most visible accomplishments was a four-building,
355-unit, low-income apartment complex in Harlem, which he helped
finance.</TE>
<TE>   One of the high-rise apartment houses was named for his wife, who
died of a heart attack in 1971, the year the project began. They had
no children.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his generosity to others, Hampton will be best remembered
for his contributions to jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the definition of swinging," Hentoff said Saturday. "The
core of jazz flowed out of him, just as it did out of Armstrong."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were pending.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Achieves Budget Breakthrough</HD>
<DH>Politics: Plan includes $2.4 billion in 'revenue
enhancements.' Senate debates package.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN, CARL INGRAM and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Ending a record two-month budget impasse, the state Assembly approved
a $98-billion spending plan late Saturday that includes $2.4 billion
in additional taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans blasted the budget proposal as unbalanced and
irresponsible, but it passed the Assembly with the minimum 54 votes
on the final night of the two-year legislative session. The Senate,
which approved its version of the budget two months ago, was expected
to agree to at least most of the Assembly version by early today.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, negotiated by Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, contained an
additional $1.7 billion in spending cuts, including an agreement to
shift authority to Gov. Gray Davis to trim $700 million from
government operations. In order to win four Republican votes,
Assembly leaders labeled the $2.4 billion in targeted tax increases
as merely "revenue enhancements."</LD>
<TE>   They included speeding up collection of taxes owed when people
sell stock options and commercial real estate, and a suspension of
Davis' much touted income tax credit for public school teachers.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most notable changes from the spending plan offered
by Davis and approved in June by the Senate, the Assembly version
includes no tobacco tax hike and no increase in the car tax.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Senate supported raising the car tax by about $1
billion and raising the state tobacco tax to $1.50 per pack, but
those efforts failed. Tobacco lobbyists held more sway in the
Assembly, which at one point proposed hiking the tax to $3 per pack
but abandoned any such increase.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dead--there wasn't support for it," said Assemblyman Jerome
Horton (D-Inglewood). "There is no cigarette tax [hike] in this
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The accord came 61 days after the July 1 start of the 2002-03
fiscal year and the constitutional deadline for having a spending
plan in place.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans condemned the budget as unbalanced even
before it becomes law. It relies on billions in loans that will take
23 years or more to fully repay. The shortfall, previously estimated
at a record $23.6 billion, may have grown to as much as $27 billion,
according to the state's most recent revenue forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), the GOP's point man on the
budget in the lower house, criticized Davis, saying he was "missing
in action" from budget talks, charging that he failed to engage "in
the single biggest thing that we do in this house in this state."</TE>
<TE>   "Have we solved the fiscal crisis? No," Campbell said, adding that
"this state is drunk on spending."</TE>
<TE>   But Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long
Beach) lauded the budget as including "concessions and compromises,"
and protecting public schools and health care programs for poor
people.</TE>
<TE>   Joining 50 Democrats in the Assembly were Republican Assemblymen
David Kelley of Idyllwild, Dick Dickerson of Redding, Mike Briggs of
Fresno and Keith Richman of Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a physician who is provisionally running for mayor of the
new city if the San Fernando Valley secedes from Los Angeles, called
the deal "significantly better than the budget introduced by the
governor and approved by the Senate." Richman said he was pleased
that the car tax would not increase, as Davis had proposed, and that
there would be no tobacco tax hike. He also said he pushed for
spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Several Republicans were skeptical about the deal, given that few
details were in print by the waning hours of the legislative session.
And it was not clear that Senate Democrats would agree to all
Assembly proposals. An angry and tired Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco) said simply, "I don't care," when asked
about the lower house's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that it's bad. But who has checked it out?" said
Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino).</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, who planned to vote against the budget, predicted that
any Republicans who supported the budget would face challenges from
the political right in future primary elections: "It's a guaranteed
issue in any campaign they ever run in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among its provisions, the budget would have the state delay making
$681 million in payments to public schools and offer early retirement
to as many as 1,000 veteran state employees at a savings of as much
as $285 million. Also as part of the deal, the Legislature and
governor would agree that at least 4% of the state general fund be
spent on public works projects.</TE>
<TE>   The deal came together after Senate Democrats brushed aside
Republican objections and approved legislation that could have
allowed Davis to triple the car taxes that motorists must pay each
year. The move could have led to a tax hike of as much as $3.9
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The car tax vote was among the year's most divisive actions. But
it also helped jolt Republicans into negotiations, according to
Democrats involved in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The maneuver so angered some Republicans that they hardened their
resolve to block the budget's approval. Sen. Maurice Johannessen
(R-Redding), the one Senate Republican who voted for the budget in
June, charged that the car tax bill violated the deal he thought he
had with Senate Democrats--and Assemblyman Dickerson vowed to
withhold his support over the car tax issue. "The fight is not over
yet," Dickerson said.</TE>
<TE>   California's Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of both
houses for a tax hike. But Senate Democrats led by Steve Peace (D-El
Cajon) concluded that the bill could be approved by simple majority
because it was mere a "clarification" of 1998 legislation pushed by
then-Gov. Pete Wilson that opened the way for the car tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   "Like hell it is," Wilson said in an interview. "This is nothing
more or less than a subterfuge to get around the two-thirds
requirement to increase taxes." Many Republicans believe the car tax
has particular resonance with the electorate. And given their
minority status in Sacramento, they are especially protective of the
constitutional requirement that both houses approve tax hikes by a
two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   In order to assuage GOP members, Assembly Democrats agreed to drop
the car tax proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "As we stand here, we're not going to take it up for a vote," said
Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek).</TE>
<TE>   The budget machinations came as the two-year legislative session
came to a close. It was, many lobbyists and veteran lawmakers said,
among the most chaotic finishes in memory.</TE>
<TE>   As the budget vote was pending, legislators voted on scores of
bills that required action by the midnight deadline:</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate killed a Hollywood tax break, aimed at halting
so-called runaway movie production. Studios and entertainment
industry unions backed the tax break. But though the break would not
have kicked in until 2004, the timing was bad, given the state's
budget deficit of nearly $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The sponsors keep coming up like they are entitled to something
instead of asking for something," Burton said. "You're going to take
what we give you."</TE>
<TE>   * A bill to prevent banks and other financial institutions from
sharing or selling consumers' personal data died in the state
Assembly for the second year in a row when moderate Democrats rallied
to kill it. The measure, SB 773 by Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough), was backed by consumer groups, who noted that polls
showed the issue to be deeply important to the public. But financial
firms spent more than $5 million in campaign donations and lobbying
to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate approved and sent to the governor a controversial
measure that would benefit Mercury Insurance Group, a Los Angeles
company that has contributed generously to two-thirds of the
Legislature. The bill, SB 689, would allow insurance companies to
offer discounts to customers who have continuously purchased

<HD>Contractors' Cost Overruns From Anthrax Cleanup: $50
Million</HD>
<DH>Audit: Postal Service cut corners unnecessarily during last
fall's crisis, its inspector general says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Private contractors hired to decontaminate postal facilities last
fall cleaned up more than just anthrax: They billed the government
for at least $50 million in unexplained cost overruns and $40 million
for mail irradiation machines that have yet to be used, federal
auditors found.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, one company received $600,000 for work it never did,
while $1 million more went into preparing decontamination facilities
that never were used. That's because officials in the two Maryland
communities where the facilities were located didn't want
anthrax-contaminated mail in their towns.</LD>
<LD>   The findings by the U.S. Postal Service's inspector general come
as postal officials ask Congress for nearly $700 million in emergency
funding to help cover costs incurred because of the anthrax attacks.
They also offer a glimpse of what is likely to come from a separate
review by the General Accounting Office, which has been asked to
examine the Postal Service's anthrax response before Congress
releases the emergency funding.</LD>
<TE>   Part of that report by the GAO is due early this month, and
sources familiar with it say it will be critical of how the Postal
Service awarded some anthrax cleanup contracts, as well as other
actions it took.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Postal Service, which has long been bedeviled by
accusations of financial mismanagement, said the emergency nature of
the anthrax response simply made a bad situation worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Purchasing methods are atrocious to begin with, and then you add
in the pressure from politicians and the public of dealing with the
anthrax crisis," said Rick Merritt, executive director of
PostalWatch, a citizen watchdog group. "Then their answer is to just
go to Congress and ask to have more money thrown at them."</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service's inspector general spent five months examining
11 contracts, totaling $104 million, awarded last fall during the
height of the anthrax crisis. The inspector general pointed out that
the Postal Service was under intense pressure to protect its own
workers after two died of inhalation anthrax, and also to assure
everyone the mail was safe.</TE>
<TE>   But the reports conclude that the Postal Service cut corners
unnecessarily, saying "contracts and delivery orders were awarded
using deviated purchasing procedures [that] exposed the Postal
Service to increased financial risk."</TE>
<TE>   "The Postal Service's response to the initial threat of anthrax
and its continuing efforts are commendable," wrote Assistant
Inspector General Ronald K. Stith. "However, our reviews identified
four areas that warranted management's attention. These areas were
contracting, transportation, contractor oversight and mail delivery."</TE>
<TE>   The reports specified that:</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of three contracts increased by nearly $54 million over
the original bids, with no documentation to explain why. For example,
a contract with Clean Harbors, hired to decontaminate the Morgan
Street Distribution Center in New York, went from $5 million to $22.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   * IT Corp. was paid $598,780 to clean the Morgan Street
facility--but the cleanup was not performed. The company was replaced
after postal officials determined it was moving too slowly, but the
money was not refunded.</TE>
<TE>   * The company that decontaminated the Pentagon's internal post
office also was retained to verify the results of the
decontamination. The contractor did not complete the work, as it had
claimed to have done in its final report. Pentagon officials spent an
additional $27,000 to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the companies that rang up the $53.7 million in cost
overruns cited in the Postal Service inspector general reports
declined to comment, referring questions to the Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials acknowledged that some mistakes were made, but
they said the unprecedented nature of the anthrax attacks caught many
government agencies off guard.</TE>

<LD>Four transplant patients may have been infected with the West Nile
virus from the donated organs of a Georgia woman who died in August,
said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   The CDC said three of the four patients--two from Georgia, two
from Florida--have developed symptoms of encephalitis, the brain
inflammation that is the most serious consequence of the illness. The
fourth person's illness is mild.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. James Hughes said doctors aren't positive that the virus was
transmitted through the transplants, but "we feel it is a high
priority to rapidly and aggressively investigate them."</LD>

<LD>The Philadelphia schools chief gave Edison Schools until Tuesday to

its contract to manage 20 of the city's low-performing schools.</LD>
<LD>   Paul G. Vallas said the company had not yet provided a financial
report for fiscal 2002 or confirmation that a $40-million line of
credit was in place.</LD>
<LD>   "We will provide the district and Vallas with the documentation,
and we'll absolutely comply with the terms of our contract," Edison
spokesman Adam Tucker said.</LD>
<TE>   Vallas told parents and students that, regardless of what Edison
does, the schools would open on time and be staffed with "quality
principals and quality teachers."</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Golden Goose in GOP Bid for Congress</HD>
<DH>Politics: For the next two months the president's schedule
will focus on upcoming party races, including his in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>After 26 days away from the White House, President Bush returns today
to the nation's capital facing an intense period of political
maneuvering and policy debate that is likely to shape the second half
of his term.</LD>
<LD>   Since leaving Washington on Aug. 6, Bush has helped collect $8.75
million for Republican candidates nationwide. Including the
contributions from events he attended just before his vacation, the
total topped $10 million for August and $100 million for the year,
surpassing the pace of the previous fund-raiser-in-chief, Bill
Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he has raised the money, Bush's task is to get out enough
support to retain the party's majority in the House, where it has a
six-vote edge, and regain control of the Senate, where the Democrats
have a one-seat margin.</LD>
<TE>   He is taking on this mission against a background of stratospheric
support among Republicans--a better than 90% approval rating, polls
show--but steadily falling numbers among independents and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   With candidates in the closest races needing cross-party support,
it adds up to this, said Charles Cook, whose Cook Political Report
newsletter tracks congressional elections: "He's an asset for
Republicans only in his ability to raise money. His ability to run
interference for Republican candidates is minimal."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, much of the president's schedule for the next two
months is being prepared with elections in mind--not only those in
November, but also two years away, when, presumably, he will be
seeking a second term. He has already made 16 visits this year to
four states--Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa and New Mexico--in which fewer
than 6,000 votes decided the outcome in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   According to a senior White House official, the thread that will
run through Bush's message on these trips will be the three
"securities" that are the underpinning of his presidency: national,
homeland and economic security.</TE>
<TE>   As polls show where Bush can most help GOP candidates, the
schedule will be adjusted to create a "very tactical" itinerary, as
one aide put it. The next eight days, for example, will see Bush
traveling to Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana, Minnesota and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this has to do with his own election in 2004," said
Stephen Hess, a scholar of the presidency at the Brookings
Institution, a centrist think tank in Washington. "A lot of places
he's going into are places he has to win, or won very closely in
2000."</TE>
<TE>   Bush will return to Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, visiting the site
where United Flight 93 crashed, and then spend three days in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   His immediate agenda will be to pressure Congress to enact his
plan for a Department of Homeland Security, stalled by a dispute with
Senate Democrats who say that it does too little to protect the
rights of the new agency's workers. It is an important point for
organized labor, a core Democratic constituency.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's top priorities, said White House deputy press secretary
Scott McClellan, will be "winning the war on terrorism, protecting
the homeland and strengthening our economy." Within that framework,
he said, sit specific legislative goals, including providing
insurance against terrorist acts and enacting the administration's
energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   In his appearances, Bush also is likely to focus on initiatives
facing difficulty in Congress. These include revisions to the welfare
program and Bush's proposal to make it easier for religious groups to
take over some of the social welfare projects carried out by
government agencies, McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   In the month before Bush arrived at his 1,600-acre ranch outside
this crossroads in central Texas, the national landscape was gloomy;
news reports were filled with accounts of a tumbling stock market and
corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   A senior White House official said the nation's needs called for a
busy vacation. This meant more work--and public visibility--than the
president would have preferred, as he sought to demonstrate concern
for the economy and to keep his agenda in the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving Washington, he has set down in 10 states, traveling
on eight of the 26 days. He had lunch one day at the ranch with
Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United
States. On another day, he held a morning-long meeting with most of
his senior national security team on proposals to transform the
military to meet the needs of the 21st century. Early in his
vacation, he spent a morning at Baylor University in nearby Waco for
a White House economic conference.</TE>
<TE>   But as the ranch visit ends, economic matters no longer monopolize
public debate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have been scattered all over the country. To the extent
they could draw attention, it has been in small doses in their home
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hess said, Bush "had an opportunity to tell his story,"
at least to those who were paying attention during a month of little
Washington news.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he added, "Iraq has moved from the back burner to the front
burner, with a vengeance."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the question of whether the United States will launch a
military operation to remove Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from
power looms over nearly everything Bush is likely to do in the coming
month. It also is likely to dominate his Sept. 12 visit to the United
Nations, where he will speak at the opening of the General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   A war against Iraq is being presented as an extension of the
response to the Sept. 11 attacks, as the president seeks to carry the
fight against terrorism into a broader territory that would, if he is
successful, remove Iraq's ability to produce chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   With the economic outlook uncertain, and other elements of Bush's
domestic agenda bringing division, seeking to rally the nation on the
war against terrorism may have a political benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're talking it up for political purposes, but
there's a political benefit to talking about foreign policy when the
other topics aren't politically favorable," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that with each passing month, Bush's overall poll numbers,
measuring whether voters have a favorable impression of him, are
slipping.</TE>
<TE>   "It is getting more and more like it was before Sept. 11," Cook
said, when a Gallup Poll found that 51% of those surveyed approved of
Bush's job performance.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, of course, frames Bush's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, in his weekly radio speech, the president set out a
new call to volunteer action. He urged Americans to "answer the call
to help those in need, and make this month a September of service,"
and "honor the memory of those lost by serving others."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Foreign Policy Assertive, Divisive</HD>
<DH>Strategy: The terrorist attack shook the White House's
thinking on military involvement overseas and gave rise to the 'Bush
Doctrine.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When George W. Bush arrived at the White House in January 2001, his
foreign policy goals appeared modest. The main international plank of
Bush's presidential campaign was a promise to restrain U.S. military
intervention in conflicts overseas, not expand it.</LD>
<LD>   But 19 months and one terrorist attack later, Bush's response to
the challenge of Al Qaeda has expanded into an ambitious and
controversial vision for a more assertive foreign policy on a global
scale.</LD>
<LD>   Already being called the "Bush Doctrine," the new policy--to be
outlined formally in a report to Congress this fall--declares the
United States ready to launch preemptive attacks on hostile countries
that deploy nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, with Iraq the
most likely target.</LD>
<TE>   Equally important, Bush aides say his "National Security Strategy"
report will range far beyond Iraq to chart a broad global role for
the United States, including calls for more cooperation with Russia
and China, more military aid to countries battling terrorists, and
more economic aid to poor nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the call for military strikes against Iraq has
become a lightning rod for controversy. But the administration's
broader argument--that the fight against terrorism provides the core
of a new U.S. strategy for what Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
calls the "post-post-Cold War era"--has also sparked debate.</TE>
<TE>   Some are ready to applaud. "It's a pretty sweeping set of ideas,
but I think it's feasible," said John Lewis Gaddis, a foreign policy
scholar at Yale University. "There's a degree of coherence that we
haven't seen for a long time. You didn't see it in the previous
administration, and you didn't see it in the first months of this
administration."</TE>
<TE>   Others are less enthusiastic, warning that the new policy, far
from sparking cooperation with other great powers, is causing
unnecessary friction.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it works," said John J. Mearsheimer, a theorist of
international relations at the University of Chicago. "Their point
that dealing with terrorism becomes the focus of foreign policy for
all the great powers, I don't believe that. It's not the focus for
Russia; it's not the focus for China. Even the Europeans think we're
obsessed."</TE>
<TE>   But most analysts agree that the new doctrine reflects a major
shift in thinking for a president who came to office with only a few
foreign policy ambitions--mainly to reduce U.S. peacekeeping
commitments abroad and deploy anti-missile defenses at home.</TE>
<TE>   What changed Bush's focus? The terrorist attack of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 was "an earthquake," said Condoleezza Rice, Bush's
national security advisor, in an interview. "It was such an
earthquake that it began almost immediately to move things around--to
the point that you could say there are new dangers here, but there
are also some new opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Among the opportunities, she said, is the hope that the United
States, Europe, Russia, China and Japan can find common ground in a
joint struggle against terrorism. "For the first time in
international history, it's probable that you won't have great power
rivalry--and that's a big deal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On that front, though, the results have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, when the issue was the threat of terrorism from Al
Qaeda, other nations quickly rallied to the U.S. side. Rice recalled
that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told Bush at one
meeting: "You understand that you cannot afford to lose--because if
you lose, we're all done for."</TE>
<TE>   But more recently, as Bush has expanded his doctrine to focus on
hostile countries with weapons of mass destruction--in his words, the
"axis of evil" of Iraq, Iran and North Korea--the only ally to offer
open support has been Britain's Tony Blair.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why there hasn't been more public support from other
countries, an official replied almost testily: "Because nobody's been
asked."</TE>
<TE>   Even within the administration there has been division over
exactly what the Bush Doctrine requires. Aides say there is a
consensus that the combination of terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction poses a clear and present danger, and that overthrowing
Iraq's Saddam Hussein must be a U.S. goal. But how to get there, and
how fast, is still being debated.</TE>
<TE>   Bush gave a preview of the strategy at West Point's graduation
ceremony in June, when he argued that countries such as Iraq are too
dangerous to be "contained."</TE>
<TE>   "Deterrence, the promise of massive retaliation against nations,
means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or
citizens to defend," the president argued. "Containment is not
possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction
can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to
terrorist allies."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Bush said, Americans must "be ready for preemptive
action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives."</TE>
<TE>   That warning grabbed the next morning's headlines. But the West
Point speech also included two more subtle arguments that are also
part of the Bush Doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   One was that conflict among the world's great powers may now be
over--but that the best way to keep the peace is for the United
States to maintain "military strength beyond challenge, thereby
making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless."</TE>
<TE>   The second was that the world does not face a "clash of
civilizations," but a struggle by all nations to implement common
values--which Bush listed as "limits on the power of the state,
respect for women and private property and free speech and equal
justice and religious tolerance." The United States, Bush said,
should help them get there.</TE>
<TE>   All of which, Gaddis and other scholars agree, adds up to the
framework of an updated global strategy for the United States--even,
perhaps, a "Bush Doctrine."</TE>
<TE>   "A doctrine is more than just a policy," Gaddis said. "A doctrine
normally results from a major crisis. It implies a reversal of
thinking; it reflects new geopolitical realities.... This probably
qualifies."</TE>
<TE>   To foreign policy analysts, the most intriguing part of the Bush
Doctrine isn't the administration's saber-rattling at Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the most interesting parts are Bush's broader arguments
that the threat to peace no longer comes from great-power conflict
but from smaller powers such as Iraq; that deterrence and containment
cannot work against such countries; and that the long-term solution
must include U.S. promotion of democracy and other American values.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Pax Americana, but Pax Americana in cooperation with other
great powers," Gaddis said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Loren D. Thompson Jr. of the Lexington Institute, "The
doctrine represents the convergence of two forces: first, the sense
of danger and urgency that followed Sept. 11, and, second, the
distrust of deterrence in the right wing of the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   The first hurdle the administration faces is persuading U.S.
allies and the American public that deterrence won't work against
Hussein, and that removing him from power is truly necessary, even if
it means going to war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have argued that Hussein must go because he
might give weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. But others,
including Brent Scowcroft, who served as national security advisor to
the first President Bush, have questioned that logic. "[Hussein] is
unlikely to risk his investment in weapons of mass destruction ... by
handing such weapons to terrorists who would use them for their own
purposes and leave Baghdad as the return address," Scowcroft wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A second problem: Bush wants to maintain a broad international
coalition against terrorism and to strengthen cooperation with other
big powers, including Russia and China. But in his campaign against
Iraq and other countries in the "axis of evil," Bush has shown little
inclination to seek much advice from other countries, drawing
complaints from such traditional allies as Britain, France and
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of what they've enunciated as global strategy has a
unilateral flavor to it," said Thompson, who largely supports the
administration approach. "Bush's speech [on preemptive action] at
West Point was an appeal to unilateral morality.... Iraq hasn't
attacked us; nor has North Korea or Iran."</TE>
<TE>   "The Clinton administration used velvet gloves ... when dealing
with the Europeans," Mearsheimer said. "The Bush administration seems
to relish using the iron fist without the velvet gloves."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Mearsheimer argued, it simply isn't clear yet that the
war on terrorism is important enough to Russia and China to turn them
into lasting allies of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The war on terrorism hasn't fundamentally altered relations among
the great powers," he said. "It doesn't preclude serious security
competition between the U.S. and China, for example."</TE>
<TE>   Rice disagrees. "Fundamentals like that don't change overnight,"
she said. "But the level of [current] cooperation with China is
unparalleled. There's no question that our relationship with Russia
is broader and deeper as a direct result of cooperation on terrorism.
So, for a few months' work, not bad."</TE>
<TE>   But over the long run, the test of the Bush Doctrine is whether it
becomes the core for a global strategy that lasts--like Harry S.
Truman's doctrine of containment, which stood for half a century as
the basis of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union--or merely a
temporary preoccupation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get down to it, Iraq may really be the only case,"
suggested Terry Deibel, a professor at the National War College. "If
that's so, it isn't much of a doctrine. In terms of looking at
foreign policy across the board, it doesn't help you all that much."</TE>
<TE>   Said Thompson: "The Truman Doctrine grew as it was applied. This
doctrine is still a newborn. It could diminish if the threat [of
terrorism] is a passing peculiarity....</TE>
<TE>   "People may look on this as a turning point in history or they may
look on it as a passing distraction. We don't know yet."</TE>

<HD>Del. Primary Falls on Jewish Holiday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delaware Jewish groups have long complained that their state's
primary elections are held, by law, on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath.
But this year, that election will also fall on Rosh Hashanah, one of
the holiest days on the Jewish calendar.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a slap in the face," says Jack Shadduck, who runs a Web site
catering to Jewish Delawarians and compares the plan to scheduling an
election on Easter.</LD>
<LD>   State law requires the election to be held on the first Saturday
after the first Monday in September; this year, that is Sept. 7. The
Legislature had considered a bill that would have delayed the contest
by a week. But after election officials said it would be too
expensive and too difficult to move the contest, the legislation
died.</LD>
<TE>   The state is allowing those with religious observances that
conflict with the election to file absentee ballots. For months,
synagogues, community centers and activists have been circulating
information among the state's 13,000 Jews on how they can get their
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   But many still consider the state's plans insulting; the Delaware
News Journal called them "callous." And some, such as Democratic
congressional candidate Steve Biener, who is Jewish, fear the
schedule will dampen Jewish turnout. He is encouraging use of the
absentee ballots but says he plans to go to the polls.</TE>

<HD>Marshal Aimed Gun at Passengers, Witnesses Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>A federal air marshal pointed a gun toward passengers on a flight
from Atlanta to Philadelphia for about 30 minutes Saturday while his
partner detained an unruly passenger, travelers said.</LD>
<LD>   Passengers on Delta Air Lines Flight 442 said one marshal kept his
weapon pointed at the coach cabin while the other huddled over the
detainee, who was released after the plane landed.</LD>
<LD>   "He had the cockpit door to his back, and he is pointing his
weapon toward the tail," Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge James A.
Lineberger said. The marshal "had the cabin folks under siege."</LD>
<TE>   "If he would have accidentally fired, he would have killed
somebody or hurt somebody," said passenger David Johnson, 51.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors declined to charge the detainee after talking
with the marshals, FBI spokeswoman Jerri Williams said Saturday. She
wouldn't release his name or elaborate on the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration spokesman David Steigman
said air marshals "dealt with a passenger who was acting in an odd
and obstreperous manner." He refused to say whether the marshal
pointed a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   A Delta spokeswoman declined to comment about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and his wife, Susan, of Mobile, Ala., said they noticed a
man talking to a female passenger sitting in the row behind him about
an hour after the flight began.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after noon, they said, marshals took the man into custody
in the first-class section of the plane, which carried 183
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The government has had air marshals patrolling planes since the
1980s but put hundreds more in the air after the Sept. 11 hijackings
of four jetliners that crashed into the World Trade Center, the
Pentagon and a western Pennsylvania field.</TE>

<HD>Holocaust Suit Accusing U.S. Clears Obstacle</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling for Hungarian survivors, who seek reparation
for Nazi loot Army seized, rejects government's immunity claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hungarian Holocaust survivors who have filed the only Holocaust
reparations lawsuit against the U.S. government have overcome the
initial hurdle to winning their case.</LD>
<LD>   The survivors sued in federal district court in Miami in May 2001.
They seek compensation for property seized by Nazis in 1944 and
recovered by the U.S. Army the following year but never returned to
the original owners.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department urged that the suit be dismissed on two
principal grounds: that the statute of limitations had run out and
that the government is entitled to immunity from such a suit.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Patricia A. Seitz ruled last week that the
plaintiffs were entitled to have the statute of limitations waived.
Seitz also held that the government's immunity argument was only
partially valid.</TE>
<TE>   Her rulings Wednesday paved the way for the case to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been dozens of Holocaust-related lawsuits
filed in the last five years, the Miami case is considered
particularly important because it is the only one in which the United
States government, rather than a foreign government or foreign
company, is named as a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Whittier Law School professor Michael Bazyler said Seitz's ruling,
though not guaranteeing victory for the plaintiffs, is very
significant. "In Holocaust-related litigation, the most important
step other than a trial is the motion to dismiss," he said. It is a
difficult hurdle for the plaintiffs because "the cases are based on
events that occurred long ago on foreign soil," said Bazyler, author
of the forthcoming book "Holocaust Justice: The Battle for
Restitution in America's Courts."</TE>
<TE>   The Miami case stems from the Nazi seizure of more than $200
million in gold, jewelry, Oriental rugs, fabrics and artwork, among
them paintings by Durer and Rembrandt. The booty was loaded aboard a
train, which came to be known as the Gold Train, headed for Germany.
But the train was abandoned by the Nazis in Austria and recovered by
the U.S. Army. The treasure trove ultimately vanished, a U.S.
commission said two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs claim that the U.S. knew or easily could have
learned the provenance of much of the stolen goods and acted
illegally by failing to return them to their rightful owners.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first suit of its kind that we are aware of and it is
highly significant that the court upheld the plaintiffs' critical
legal argument on the statute of limitations" and other issues, said
Washington, D.C., attorney Jon Cuneo, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy now that we have won the first round and will
have the chance to get the full information that was kept from us all
these years," said plaintiff David Mermelstein, who was 15 when the
German Army invaded Hungary in 1944. The suit contends that silver
candelabras and cups used in Jewish prayer ceremonies were taken from
his parents' house, then recovered but never returned.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department had no comment on Seitz's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Department attorneys contended that because Hungarian Jews knew as
early as 1947 that the U.S. Army had taken possession of the Gold
Train, the six-year statute of limitations had expired no later than
1953.</TE>
<TE>   But Seitz said the lawsuit's allegations were sufficient to
justify rolling back the statute of limitations--namely allegations
that "plaintiffs were induced or tricked by the Government's
misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs said that starting in the summer of 1946, the U.S.
government declared it was not possible to identify the individual
owners of the property on the train, or even the appropriate country
of ownership. The plaintiffs assert that the Army possessed evidence
of ownership, including inventories prepared by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the U.S. government sold, distributed or
requisitioned the property, according to the suit. The plaintiffs
contend that the property was sold through the Army Exchange Service,
donated to international refugee services or used by U.S. military
officers as home and office furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   The suit relies in part on reports issued in October 1999 and
December 2000 by the President's Advisory Commission on Holocaust
Assets, which cited previously classified U.S. government documents.</TE>
<TE>   The reports state that Maj. Gen Harry J. Collins, the chief U.S.
military official in western Austria at the end of World War II,
placed orders from a U.S. military warehouse in Salzburg, Austria,
for enough china and silver for 45 people, as well as a dozen silver
candlesticks, glassware, 30 sets of table linens, carpets and furs
for his villa and a personal railroad car.</TE>
<TE>   Collins died in 1963 and is buried in Salzburg. Samuel J. Dubbin,
a Coral Gables, Fla., attorney who also represents the plaintiffs,
said the whereabouts of the goods Collins received is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbin said the work of the Holocaust Commission and other
archival records "demonstrate that in a significant and inexplicable
violation of its own rules, the United States failed to return these
assets, did not truthfully respond to requests from Hungarian Jewish
community organizations for information about the property and
concealed those facts for 50 years."</TE>
<TE>   Seitz said it wasn't until 1999, when the Holocaust Commission
released its first report, that the facts needed for the plaintiffs'
lawsuit came to light.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules governing federal lawsuits, Seitz said she was
obliged at this stage of the case to accept as true that "plaintiffs
and other members of the class have been kept in ignorance of vital
information essential to pursue their claims, without any fault or
lack of diligence on their part."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs still face formidable challenges. Thus far, there
are 13 plaintiffs, but for the case to be certified as a class-action
suit and have a broader reach, the plaintiffs' attorneys will have to
convince Seitz that there is a valid class of similarly affected
individuals whose claims should be litigated en masse. Attorney Cuneo
said there potentially could be thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Seitz noted in her ruling that "it is not clear, based
upon the [lawsuit], that [the plaintiffs'] belongings were
specifically identifiable Gold Train property. Plaintiffs will need
to be prepared to address this issue during discovery," the judge
wrote.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Is Fully Cooperating With Government, His Lawyers Say</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Captured with the Taliban, American hopes to
earn a 20-year sentence under plea deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh's lawyers say he is telling federal agents
everything he knows, and that he wants Americans to forgive him for
joining the Taliban in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The United States would be interested in Lindh's knowledge of
other fighters he met as well as places he had been in Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Before his military training in Afghanistan, he spent
time in a pro-Taliban border region of Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   In recent interviews, attorneys Tony West and George Harris would
not describe the information Lindh is providing, and government
officials refused to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Lindh, a 21-year-old Marin County native, is undergoing
debriefings with several government agencies as part of a plea
agreement. He would receive a maximum 20-year prison term if
officials are satisfied with his cooperation and the judge approves
the deal at an Oct. 4 sentencing. Multiple agencies are attending the
debriefings, West said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh "was not unique in being a Westerner who converted to Islam
and decided to fight against the Northern Alliance," the anti-Taliban
militia that became a U.S. ally, West said. "John ran into many
Westerners who converted."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh never contemplated that he would be fighting in a war that
Americans would enter, the lawyers said. He now believes he made a
terrible mistake by enlisting with Afghanistan's harsh former rulers
and wants Americans to forgive him, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh understands Americans' extremely negative feelings toward
him, West said. He wants his countrymen to know that he was not a
terrorist and never joined Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, even
though he met Bin Laden in a military training camp in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands Sept. 11 changed the way people view Islam and
that he came into national consciousness at a time there was a great
deal of justified national pain and anger," West said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh is confined to his cell except for debriefings, family
visits and meetings with his lawyers. He hopes he will soon be
allowed in an outdoor prisoner area.</TE>
<TE>   Still a devout Muslim, Lindh reads the Koran and prays every day.
He believes Bin Laden and the Sept. 11 hijackers acted contrary to
Islam's teachings by attacking innocent civilians and--in the
attackers' cases--committing suicide, the lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh pleaded guilty July 15 to supplying services to the Taliban
and carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony.</TE>
<TE>   While living in a region dominated by Taliban supporters before
Sept. 11, he became convinced that the Taliban sought to establish a
pure Islamic nation and joined their army because he believed in what
they were doing.</TE>
<TE>   West and Harris said there were errors in the government's
indictment. The principal mistakes, West contended, were allegations
that Lindh trained in an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in June 2001
and, while there, was told before Sept. 11 that the terrorist network
had dispatched about 50 people to carry out 20 suicide operations
against the U.S. and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said Lindh heard about Al Qaeda operations from others in
his unit only after Sept. 11, and had no way of verifying what he
heard.</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A man arrested last spring after his daughter told police she saw him
fatally stab an encyclopedia saleswoman with a screwdriver 34 years
ago died Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth C. Richmond, 70, died of bladder cancer at Larue D. Carter
Memorial Hospital, defense attorney Steve Litz said.</LD>
<LD>   Richmond was charged in May with what prosecutors said was the
racially motivated murder in Martinsville of Carol Marie Jenkins, 21.</LD>
<TE>   The 1968 crime has long haunted the nearly all-white rural Indiana
city of about 12,000, which gained a reputation for racism after the
slaying of Jenkins, who was black.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Richmond McQueen told investigators that at age 7 she
watched from a car as her father stabbed Jenkins in the chest in a
drunken rage while yelling racial slurs.</TE>
<TE>   McQueen said another man she did not know held Jenkins during the
attack. She testified her father had "a pronounced dislike for black
people."</TE>

<HD>Every Drop of Water Precious in Thirsty Ariz. Town</HD>
<DH>Drought: Throngs of weekend visitors and severe conditions
are overtaxing local supply. Residents are becoming experts at making
do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PINE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>As thousands of tourists converge today in this high-country town for
its annual-- but belated--arts and crafts festival, the big question
is what will be depleted first: the quilts, ceramic dishes and
cottonwood bark sculptures, or the town's water supply.</LD>
<LD>   Pine, at 5,500 feet in central Arizona's Mogollon Rim, relies
almost exclusively on wells to tap underground water. But with
precious little winter snow or summer rain falling on the towering
escarpment that runs across the middle of Arizona, the state's
worst-recorded drought is taking its toll.</LD>
<LD>   The mountain slope's swiftly moving aquifer has never been as
stingy. On high-demand weekends like this one, when overheated
Phoenix folks come to enjoy weekend retreats in the shade of
ponderosa pines and treasure-hunting tourists scour the town's shops,
water is consumed more quickly than it can be replenished.</LD>
<TE>   The water company has parked a potable water truck near the center
of town so local residents can fill containers if needed, and Phoenix
residents were warned Friday that if they were heading here for the
arts festival, which ends today, they should bring their own water.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of anxiety over whether we'll have enough water to
make it through the weekend," said local resident Ed Paul, a U.S.
Forest Service firefighter, on Saturday afternoon. "There are a lot
of weekend residents in town, and tourists, so it's probable that we
won't have any water left by Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Most locals shrug off the impending shortage as the cost of living
in the mountains here, and indeed, they are becoming somewhat expert
at it.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the town ran out of water two months ago, capping off an
already dismal July 4th weekend. Because nearby forest fires had
burned nearly half a million acres, and the tinder-dry woods had been
closed to campers, hikers, fishermen and other users, the summer arts
and crafts show was postponed until this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with no influx of tourists in early July, about 800 of
Pine's 1,931 residents had no water for up to eight days.</TE>
<TE>   Some Pine residents maintain private wells, live in small
subdivisions served by their own well fields or live along Pine Creek
and have historic settler rights to its water.</TE>
<TE>   During the July 4th water shortage, those affected purchased
bottled water for their cooking needs, showered at sports clubs in
Payson, 19 miles southeast, and filled buckets with nonpotable water
from trucks to service their toilets.</TE>
<TE>   Living with the drought has become a way of life here. Outdoor
watering is prohibited, and residents are expected to cut their
interior water use by half or face possible fines.</TE>
<TE>   "We know who our good customers have been, who can't cut back by
half because they're already conserving so much," said Myndi Brogdon,
spokeswoman for Brooke Utilities Inc., a Bakersfield-based firm that
owns water companies in California and Arizona, including the local
Pine Water Co.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette Buchholz, 80, knows the drought drill: She keeps a dozen
gallon jugs filled with water on her porch, either to flush the
toilets or to cook, when her tap no longer delivers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's worth it, in order to live here," she said. "I love these
tall pines, the rocks, the quiet."</TE>
<TE>   There is some complaints among full-time residents that weekend
residents abuse water.</TE>
<TE>   "The part-timers are running their drip [irrigation] systems all
the time--you can see the water running down the street," complained
Jim Thompson, who moved here four years ago from Chicago. "They
should have their water cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Pine has few options for resolving its water problem, short of an
end to the drought.</TE>
<TE>   Dig more wells? Because Pine is surrounded by the Tonto National
Forest, it is generally restricted to drilling within the town
limits. But because of the town's reliance on septic tanks and leach
fields, there is little land available for new wells.</TE>
<TE>   Dig deeper wells? Many wells that once produced good amounts of
water at 160 feet deep are now dry. The local water improvement
district sank a test well to 1,800 feet, but it found little water.
In the cavern-pocked limestone underground here, finding fractures
and fissures with water is something of a crapshoot.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find more water somewhere," said John Breninger, a
director of the local water improvement district. "The problem is, we
don't necessarily know where it is, how much there is, and where to
intercept it."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Pine is trying to recover its lost summer at the
eleventh hour. Besides today's arts show, an antiques festival,
originally scheduled for late July, will be held Oct. 12-13, complete
with a classic car show and pit barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like the summer that never happened, like someone put a
big 'canceled' sign on it," said Dennis Abel, who owns the Ginger
Bread House antiques store and ice cream parlor with his wife,
Shirley Vickers.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of the summer, our business is off 50%. This
weekend isn't just the best weekend of the summer, it's basically
been our only weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "And now that we have all these people coming to town, we're at
risk of running out of water. What a summer."</TE>

<KH>THE TIMES POLL</KH>
<HD>Public's Mood on Priorities Changes</HD>
<DH>Politics: The war on terror is losing ground to economic
woes, which could benefit Democrats in congressional races. Bush's
ratings remain generally strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising anxiety about the nation's direction and continued uncertainty
about the economy appear to be strengthening the Democrats' position
in the battle for control of Congress, a Times Poll has found.</LD>
<LD>   But with President Bush still enjoying high approval ratings and
nearly three-fifths of Americans indicating they are inclined to
reelect their member of Congress, the poll points toward another
closely fought election between two parties that finished the 2000
campaign in a virtual dead heat.</LD>
<LD>   Against that backdrop of broad partisan parity, the poll finds
some shifts in the landscape that could help Democrats. In the
survey, the share of Americans dissatisfied with the country's
overall direction increased sharply from earlier this year; that's
usually a warning sign for the party holding the White House.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, more people now pick Democrats than Republicans
when asked which party can best handle the most important problem
facing the country, and which party they intend to support in
November's congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the Democratic rise may be an underlying shift in the
public's focus: More than twice as many Americans now say the
economy, rather than the war on terrorism, will be the most important
issue in determining their vote for Congress. And Democrats have
opened a 44% to 38% advantage on the critical measure of which party
can do a better job of handling the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me every time the country has been in a bad way
economically, a Democratic administration has had to come in and
bring the country out of it. I see the old pattern going on again,"
said Orville Ives, a retired utility contractor in Port Charlotte,
Fla., who responded to the poll.</TE>
<TE>   None of this guarantees that the Democrats will gain in November.
The broad national measure of voter preference in congressional
elections, for instance, has not always been a precise predictor of
the outcome of individual House races.</TE>
<TE>   And Bush's popularity could still be an important asset for GOP
candidates: 37% of those polled say they would be more likely to vote
for a congressional candidate who would help Bush implement his
agenda, compared with 17% who say they would be less likely (42% said
it won't affect their vote).</TE>
<TE>   "I think the way Bush has handled things has been just fine," said
Cindy Cavitt, a traveling photographer from Coachella, Calif. "I'm
usually more inclined to vote Republican ... and I don't see any real
reason to change."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, supervised by director Susan Pinkus, interviewed
1,372 adults nationwide from Aug. 22 to 25. It has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   In November's elections, voters will select all 435 House members
as well as senators in 34 states and governors in 36. The election
will determine control of the House, where the GOP has a six-seat
edge, and the Senate, which the Democrats command by a single seat.</TE>
<TE>   The poll suggests that the campaign will be fought out against a
backdrop of resurfacing political divisions and sustained ambivalence
about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   From several angles, the poll finds the wave of unity that washed
away partisan differences after last September's terrorist attacks is
receding. Indeed, the new survey finds the nation reverting to the
polarized assessments about Bush's presidency evident before Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Bush continues to receive strong marks in many areas. Two-thirds
say they approve of his overall job performance, and he receives good
grades on handling the terrorist threat (74%), foreign policy (61%),
the economy (56%) and even corporate fraud (55%). Only for his
handling of the federal budget, which has fallen back into deficit
after four years of surpluses, does the president fall below majority
support, with 48%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush's scores on those measures are down from the
stratospheric heights he reached in a Times Poll in February; at that
point, his overall approval rating hit 80%. And old divides are
reemerging.</TE>
<TE>   Among voters who consider themselves Republicans, Bush's support
has hardly declined at all: an impressive 93% of GOP partisans still
approve of his job performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, he's doing a good job," said Republican Edward Brog, a
retired teacher in Elmwood, Ill. "As I listen to the national news
broadcasts and read the newspaper, the thing that impresses me most
about the criticism ... is that it seems to be more politically
motivated than because there is real substance to the objection."</TE>
<TE>   Among independents, Bush's approval ratings have slipped since
February, but only modestly--from 81% to 71%. "Given how he started,
with the questionable election, it's fortuitous for him, in a strange
way, that he had an event [Sept. 11] that he could show his
strengths," said Carol Kleiner, an independent in Colorado Springs,
Colo.</TE>
<TE>   It's among self-described Democrats that Bush has suffered the
largest erosion. Since February, his ratings with Democrats have
dropped 13 percentage points for his handling of the economy, 17
points for his overall job performance and 27 points on foreign
policy. Now 60% of Democrats give Bush failing marks on the economy
and for his handling of the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy has gone straight to hell since the new
administration took over," says Ives, the retired contractor, who
usually leans Democratic. "We had trillions of dollars in [budget]
surpluses before they took over. Now we are ready to start borrowing
again just to keep the government going."</TE>
<TE>   Partisan loyalties even appear to be shaping perceptions about the
economy. Though the poll found that a majority of Democrats say the
economy is doing poorly, nearly three-fourths of Republicans believe
it is doing well. Republicans are also much more optimistic than
Democrats that the economy will pick up over the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, things seem to be going pretty good," said Glenn
Turner, who runs a small trucking company in Raleigh, N.C. "It takes
time to get out of a recession."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the public mood on the economy appears not so much gloomy
as anxious.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-fifths said the economy is in recession. But only one
in nine said it was a serious recession. And the share of Americans
who believe the country isn't in recession at all more than doubled,
from 15% in February to 36% in the new survey.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is all right," says Cavitt, the traveling
photographer. "It's not as bad as everybody thinks it is."</TE>
<TE>   Still, economic concerns can be felt in other measures. About 45%
of adults say the economy is either performing fairly badly or very
badly. And on the most basic measure of public sentiment, just 45% of
adults say the country is on the right track; an equal number say it
is heading in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   That's a sharp jump from the 26% in February who said the country
was moving in the wrong direction. In the new survey, those down on
the country's course cited the economy more than any other reason for
their dissatisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, voters unhappy with the country's direction are more
likely to support the party out of the White House. That pattern is
holding again.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Democrats led 47% to 39% over the GOP when voters were
asked which party they intend to back in November's congressional
elections. Among those who believe the country is on the right track,
the GOP led by 19 percentage points; Democrats led by 34 points among
those who believe the nation is moving in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, those numbers reflect a circular logic: Because
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to consider the country on
the wrong track, it's not surprising that those pessimistic voters
are more likely to support Democratic candidates for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But the relationship is a telling divide among independent voters
as well. Independents divide almost in half about whether the country
is moving in the right direction. Those who think the country is on
the right track prefer Republicans by a 2-1 margin in the
congressional vote. Independents unhappy with the country's direction
prefer Democrats by nearly that much.</TE>
<TE>   Preferences in the congressional election also are generally
dividing along fault lines that have become familiar in U.S. politics
during the last decade. Men prefer GOP candidates by 8 percentage
points; women prefer Democrats by 22 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats ran strongest in the East and West, while Republicans
led in the Midwest. In one surprise, Democrats held a 46% to 44%
advantage in the South, which has been a GOP stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Married voters prefer the GOP by 8 percentage points; singles back
the Democrats by more than a 2-1 rate. Both sides have consolidated
their base: Nearly 90% of Democrats and Republicans say they will
back their own party's candidates for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also contains two measures of early sentiment toward
2004.</TE>
<TE>   Three-quarters of Republicans said they want Bush to keep Vice
President Dick Cheney on his ticket if he runs again.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found somewhat more restrained good news for former
Vice President Al Gore: 29% of Democrats said they would definitely
support him for the party's nomination again in 2004, with 35% more
saying they probably would back him; 13% said they definitely would
not, and 19% more said they probably would not.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, the most ominous sign in the poll is the prevalence of
doubts about his economic agenda, not only among Democrats but many
independents. Although the majority approve of Bush's handling of the
economy, that finding may reflect the broader support and trust he
still enjoys after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   On more specific measures, Bush's economic agenda doesn't score
nearly so well:</TE>
<TE>   * Just 18% said Bush has a clear policy for dealing with the
economy; 72% said he's merely reacting to events.</TE>
<TE>   * Among those who said the economy is doing badly, 24% said Bush's
economic policies were principally to blame. That's more than any
other cause chosen except corporate fraud, which also drew 24%. With
independents, corporate fraud and Bush's policies finished No. 1 and
No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   * Fifty-six percent said they believe Bush's economic policies
favor the rich, and 55% said he cares more about protecting the
interests of large corporations than ordinary citizens. In each case,
a majority of independents shared those negative views.</TE>
<TE>   * By 51% to 39%, a majority said they believe that an economic
policy focused on reducing the federal deficit and paying down the
national debt would be a more effective way to stimulate the economy
than further tax cuts, as Bush is urging.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can afford the tax cut," said Don Weiler, a
pharmacist in LaPorte, Ind. "A lot of time, the people [the] tax cuts
are designed to help don't get the help."</TE>
<TE>   * Support appears thin for Bush's proposal to allow workers to
divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes into individual
accounts that they could invest in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Although Americans initially back the idea, 48% to 44%, many of
those who like the proposal say they would oppose it if it required a
reduction in the guaranteed Social Security benefit--as virtually all
private investment plans would.</TE>
<TE>   If guaranteed benefits are reduced, just 25% say they would back
private accounts, with 64% opposing.</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,372 Americans nationwide, including 1,163
registered voters, by telephone Aug. 22-25. Telephone numbers were
chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers
could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted slightly to
conform with census figures for sex, race, age, education and region.
The margin of sampling error for the entire sample and for registered
voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points.  For certain subgroups
the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be
affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in
which questions are presented.</TE>

<HD>Breath of Fresh Air Is Rare in Great Smoky Mountains</HD>
<DH>Pollution: In summer, the smog at the popular national park
is almost as bad as in Los Angeles. The haze often obscures scenic
Southern vistas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, Tenn. -- A slow procession of
cars arcs around Cades Cove, a grassy valley so rich in wildlife that
the deer feed right next to the one-lane road. Not far from where a
group of Illinois tourists has halted traffic to point their video
cameras at four wild hogs, a research scientist aims at a different
target: the tailpipes of this ceaseless stream of vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Using computers and infrared light, the roadside researchers are
measuring the exhaust from vehicles traveling throughout the park. A
separate experiment is taking place high in a section of the park
called Newfound Gap, where investigators are checking the breathing
of hikers along a four-mile portion of the Appalachian Trail.</LD>
<LD>   The two testing programs, both begun in recent weeks, are part of
a larger effort to figure out just how big a mess has been made of
the air surrounding Great Smoky Mountains National Park, half a
million acres of abundant old forests and rivers straddling Tennessee
and North Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   The news is already known to be bad. The park, whose 9.5 million
visitors make it the most-visited national park in the United States,
also suffers the worst air pollution--often worse than cities such as
nearby Knoxville, Tenn., or Atlanta, 150 miles to the south. The
mountains corral contaminants drifting from dozens of coal-burning
power plants and factories in the region, and from fast-spreading
cities and growing fleets of cars.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-year study of air pollution in the southern Appalachians
concluded Thursday that most of the area's haze is produced locally,
contradicting a long-held view that it comes from industrial states
like Ohio and Pennsylvania. The study of pollution in eight states
pinned blame mainly on power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Still more pollution comes from the millions of vehicles
circulating in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious result is a whitish haze that on many days
obscures the steep hillsides of pine, poplar and oak. It is quite
different from the naturally occurring wisps of moist mountain air
that inspired the early Cherokees to name the area the "land of blue
smoke."</TE>
<TE>   At higher elevations, the haze is "not much different than the
L.A. Basin," said park Supt. Mike Tollefson. "It's not as brown, but
on a bad summer day it's truly not much different from L.A. in air
quality and health effects."</TE>
<TE>   Visibility from lookouts such as the 6,600-foot Clingmans Dome has
dropped during the summer months by 80% since 1948, according to
studies. Spots that should afford 100-mile views under ideal
conditions now yield just 25; that range drops to 15 miles in summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been coming up here for 50 years and it's a marked decrease
in visibility," said Glenn Lynch, from Jefferson City, Tenn., who was
visiting the park with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Deteriorating vistas are not unique to the Smokies. Smog and soot
have smudged views at national parks all over, from Big Bend in West
Texas to Sequoia/Kings Canyon in California. The parks' dirty air has
been a central theme in the debate over proposals to place stricter
federal standards on old power plants and other facilities burning
fossil fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere has the problem been more evident than at Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. The park operates seven air monitors,
measuring ozone, acidity and other factors. The readings often
indicate unhealthy air.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't expect that. They think they're going to a national
park area and the air should be pristine and clean. It's not," said
Janice Nolen, director of national policy at the American Lung Assn.,
which is sponsoring the two-week tailpipe study, described as the
first of its kind in a national park.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which began Tuesday, was timed to coincide with the
busy Labor Day weekend, when traffic is heavy. The goal is to learn
how much of the park's pollution is coughed up from the cars of its
visitors. A report is due in October.</TE>
<TE>   Park planners are considering ways to cut traffic in congested
sections such as Cades Cove. One suggestion is to have a tram or bus
system replace cars on the 11-mile, single-lane loop.</TE>
<TE>   Two million visitors a year motor around the tranquil meadows,
which are dotted with cabins dating to the early 1800s. Motorists
stop constantly to gawk at deer or black bears, creating tie-ups that
can turn the scenic valley tour into a four-hour ordeal. Other
national parks, including Yosemite and Grand Canyon, have restricted
access by private vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The hiker study, which involves researchers from three
universities, seeks to gauge the effect of airborne pollutants on
park visitors who are exercising. Hikers setting out from Newfound
Gap, at 5,000 feet, are asked to fill out questionnaires and to blow
into a device to gauge the size of a breath and how forcefully it is
expelled. The volunteers are also asked to measure their pulse while
hiking. The park's levels of sulfur and nitrogen--the makings of acid
rain--and of ozone are among the highest in the eastern United
States. Ridge-top ozone readings are twice as high as those found in
Knoxville and Atlanta. Park visitors encounter roadside displays
describing the pollution. A computerized kiosk inside the visitor
center carries a live video feed from a camera at Look Rock and
flashes real-time ozone levels, as measured by remote monitors.</TE>
<TE>   In summer, park officials regularly issue health warnings on days
when ozone levels exceed federal clean-air standards. The park has
registered 36 unhealthy days this year--a pace ahead of that in 1999,
when there were 52, the most on record.</TE>
<TE>   The park's tall reach means that its peaks soak in acid-rich
clouds and often experience high ozone levels even overnight, when
the chemical usually dissipates in low-lying areas.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be more unhealthy to hike the [Appalachian Trail] at 8 in
the morning than to be in Atlanta" on a bad-air day, said Jim Renfro,
the park's air-quality specialist.</TE>
<TE>   No species have died off, but park officials said there has been
harm. Park studies have shown that high ozone levels threaten at
least 30--and possibly up to 90--species of plants and trees,
including black cherry, tulip poplar, sassafras and tall milkweed.</TE>
<TE>   Sulfur and nitrogen overload soils, interfering with the ability
of plants and trees to gain nourishment and raising the acidity of
streams where trout and other creatures dwell.</TE>
<TE>   Renfro said the park's air quality mostly has worsened over the
last 15 years, despite improvements by nearby utilities in reducing
contaminants during power generation. Pollution wafts in from as far
as the Midwest, while contamination from sources such as automobiles
has grown, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree it's unlikely the Smokies' haze will be cured by
targeting tourists' cars. Some visitors said limiting cars in Cades
Cove might give them less chance to see the animals that drew them.
Others said a tram seemed a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   For John Leary, a store manager from Springfield, Ohio, who was
taking pictures of a 180-year-old cabin, the once-clear vistas
appeared increasingly a thing of the past too. Leary recalled his
family's pictures of the Smokies, taken during vacations in the
1960s. "They seem to be a lot more crisp and clear," he said.</TE>

<HD>Watching as a Race She Can't Lose Slips Away</HD>
<DH>Maryland: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend has the name, money and
party affiliation to become governor. But it may not be enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHESDA, Md.</DL>
<LD>She was supposed to carry the power and promise of Camelot to a new
generation. Poised to glide to the governor's office in Maryland,
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend had everything--the name, the money, the
connections--to carry on the dream that died when her father, Robert
F. Kennedy, was assassinated in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles
in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   And, in a state where voter registration is Democratic by a 2-1
margin and the election is more than two months away, she still could
make history, becoming the first female governor of Maryland and the
first Kennedy to hold executive office since her uncle John F.
Kennedy was president.</LD>
<LD>   But what has stunned Maryland insiders, at the Capitol in
Annapolis, in key precincts in Baltimore's more gritty areas and in
Bethesda's tony suburbs of Washington, is how far and how quickly the
candidate known as KKT has fallen.</LD>
<TE>   "This is all about KKT," said Blair Lee, the son and grandson of
Maryland politicians, and now a newspaper columnist for the
Montgomery County Journal. "It's her race to lose, and she's doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Having served eight years in the largely ceremonial post of
lieutenant governor, Townsend--married to a professor at St. John's
College in Annapolis and the mother of four daughters--has been the
architect of her own fall, from a 15-percentage-point lead in January
to leads of 3 and 7 percentage points in two recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   She is not a natural campaigner, stumbling on the small words that
matter most in politics. Campaigning among Latinos, she coined the
word "Hispanish." Introducing her running mate, Adm. Charles Larson,
she called him Ambassador Lawson. And the winning horse at the
Preakness, War Emblem, became, in her speech, War Monger.</TE>
<TE>   Far more damaging, in a state where 31% of the population is
black, is that she passed over qualified black candidates for
lieutenant governor, selecting instead a white, retired admiral who
had been a registered Republican only weeks earlier. The strategy was
based on an assumption that the left wing of the Democratic Party
would stay with her while she courted more conservative voters in the
middle. The move backfired a few days later when her likely
Republican opponent, Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., selected as his
running mate Michael Steele, a graduate of Georgetown University Law
School and an African American who chairs the Maryland Republican
Party.</TE>
<TE>   But the greatest hurdle Townsend faces may be generational.
Sharesse DeLeaver, a 27-year-old African American who serves as
Ehrlich's deputy communications director, noted that the era when
many voters kept pictures of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F.
Kennedy on their mantels has passed, that concerns about civil rights
have given way to middle-class interests in schools and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There are hundreds of thousands of voters in Maryland who don't
remember her father or uncle," political scientist Matthew Crenson
said. "She is more on her own than the Democratic leadership thought
when they rallied behind her."</TE>
<TE>   But Townsend is not without resources. Party loyalists have
bolstered her campaign staff with seasoned pros, and some observers
say Townsend is getting better on the stump, likely the result of
speech training.</TE>
<TE>   And, she has a considerable campaign war chest: $6 million to
Ehrlich's $3 million. Democratic media expert Bob Shrum, hired by the
campaign as an advisor, is expected to launch a negative assault on
Ehrlich after the Sept. 10 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "She's going to crucify him with ads," said Lee, the Journal
columnist. "There's nothing wrong with her campaign that $3 million
of negative ads can't cure. Everybody in Annapolis is waiting for
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Townsend campaign declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   If Townsend does turn negative, it might be a sign that she is her
father's daughter. Bobby Kennedy had a reputation as a rough-edged
liberal, a prosecutor and congressional investigator who rooted out
Communists and mob figures and who later, as attorney general to
President Kennedy, went after Cuba's Fidel Castro and the bigoted
governors of the pre-Voting Rights Act South.</TE>
<TE>   Townsend is hampered by other ghosts as well.</TE>
<TE>   No lieutenant governor has ever won election to governor in
Maryland, although Lee's father, Blair Lee III, became acting
governor after Marvin Mandel was convicted of mail fraud (he was
later pardoned by President Reagan) and stripped of office.</TE>
<TE>   She is tethered to an eight-year incumbent, Parris Glendening,
whose popularity has been sinking ever since he left his wife of 24
years, taking up with a former deputy chief of staff. In January, the
59-year-old governor married 35-year-old Jennifer Crawford; she gave
birth to their daughter last month.</TE>
<TE>   And the FBI is investigating allegations of beatings at Maryland's
boot camps for young juvenile offenders. The allegations sparked
headlines and legislative investigations at a time when Townsend was
responsible for oversight of the state's juvenile justice system.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who said he has spent much time watching the candidate and
enjoyed several long lunches with her, believes KKT got into politics
to carry on her father's legacy. He also thinks that after easily
winning the Sept. 10 Democratic primary (as Ehrlich also is expected
to do on the GOP side), Townsend could well lose the general election
in November because voters detect a borrowed mission.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a nice, honest person, but I'm convinced she is in
politics for all the wrong reasons," he said. "She's doing it out of
a sense of family duty. And the problem with her campaign is that
voters sense she is just not in her element."</TE>

<CX>   Maryland governor--A Sept. 1 story in Section A about Maryland
gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend incorrectly
reported that President Reagan pardoned a former Maryland governor,
Marvin Mandel, who was convicted of fraud. In fact, Reagan commuted
Mandel's prison sentence after he had served 19 months of a
three-year term. The U.S. Supreme Court years later let stand a lower
court decision overturning the conviction.</CX>

<HD>Wal-Mart Denies Boosting Dole Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart executives said it was a mistake to mail a company
publication featuring Republican Senate candidate Elizabeth Hanford
Dole on the cover less than two weeks before the GOP primary.</LD>
<LD>   The publication, sent to nearly 200,000 North Carolina residents,
was meant to promote literacy--not Dole's candidacy, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "There was nothing remotely political in the intent," said Jay
Allen, Wal-Mart's senior vice president for corporate affairs. "It
was a matter of coincidence and an honest mistake."</LD>
<TE>   Allen said the Bentonville, Ark., company would send a letter to
the Federal Election Commission informing it of the mailing to make
sure no campaign laws were violated.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's rivals said the mailing was a blatant attempt by the
nation's largest retail chain to influence North Carolina's primary.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the political titans invade North Carolina attempting
to influence the electorate," said Jim Snyder, a Lexington lawyer and
one of six GOP opponents of Dole seeking to succeed Jesse Helms.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart requested the Dole interview in March, about the same
time the company's executives were contributing the maximum amount
allowed under federal law to her campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Copies of "Source" were mailed to 195,000 North Carolina homes and
several million residences nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The cover features a photo of Dole with an American flag flying in
the background.</TE>
<TE>   In an article titled "Elizabeth Dole would like you to read this
article," Dole talks about the need to encourage literacy. The
article does not mention the election.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart officials said they approached Dole about appearing on
the cover of their annual literacy issue after Oprah Winfrey turned
the company down.</TE>
<TE>   On March 4, David Glass, the chief executive officer of Wal-Mart,
and his wife gave the Dole campaign $4,000, the maximum allowed for
individuals, according to campaign finance records.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, Wal-Mart's political action committee
contributed $10,000 to Dole's campaign, the maximum permitted for a
PAC.</TE>

<HD>Chad MacDonald's Legacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unexpected good that flowed from Chad MacDonald's short life and
tragic death was a state law that slapped strict limits on police
agencies that still use youths as informants in criminal
investigations. Now that MacDonald's family has accepted a $1-million
settlement from Brea and Yorba Linda in connection with the
17-year-old's murder, police departments have more reason to abandon
the risky practice of recruiting youthful informants.</LD>
<LD>   MacDonald's death in 1998 at the hands of drug dealers underscored
the potential for danger when youthful informants are sent into dark
and dangerous places. MacDonald was beaten, tortured and strangled;
his bruised and battered body was subsequently recovered from an
alley in Los Angeles. His girlfriend was beaten, raped, shot and left
for dead in the Angeles National Forest. Their assailants were
convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole</LD>
<LD>   The state law that passed shortly after MacDonald's death, coupled
with the threat of civil lawsuits like that filed by the MacDonalds,
should force the relatively few police agencies still using youthful
informants to rethink their policies. Police have no business
recruiting youths who can't legally buy cigarettes or beer to serve
as informants. Police agencies that still use informants counter with
the solid argument that it's difficult to pry open the secretive
world of teenagers.</LD>
<TE>   MacDonald's death, however, underscored all that can go wrong.
MacDonald clearly was no angel; his ill-fated role as informant
stemmed from a January 1998 arrest in Yorba Linda for possessing and
transporting methamphetamine. After his mother signed a waiver,
MacDonald worked briefly as an informant for the Brea police, making
one drug buy while wearing a recording device.</TE>
<TE>   Brea police, who also serve in Yorba Linda, say they stopped using
MacDonald some time before he made the fatal trip to a drug house in
Norwalk. Police maintain MacDonald was dropped as an informant after
a second arrest for methamphetamine possession, and that the boy was
not in Norwalk at their behest.</TE>
<TE>   Brea officials said the city's insurance company approved the
settlement because ending a potentially long court battle made
financial sense. But the MacDonalds believe that police agencies will
be forced to reconsider policies after word spreads about the
settlement involving one of Orange County's largest police department
payouts.</TE>
<TE>   The MacDonalds also hope that legislation signed into law by
then-Gov. Pete Wilson will protect youngsters. The law originally
banned the use of all juvenile informants, but was amended to
prohibit the use of children 12 and younger. Police must gain
approval from a judge before recruiting 13- to 17-year-olds. Judges,
who must consider the youth's age and maturity, play a crucial role
in ensuring that everyone involved--those being asked to serve as
informants, their parents and the police--recognize the potential for
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Adults who agree to act as informants arguably have the ability to
balance the risks and rewards of potentially dangerous situations.
But youths who have run into trouble with the law--and parents who
must sign waivers--shouldn't be put in the position of having to make
these kinds of decisions.</TE>

<HD>Cut the Fuse on Fireworks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the summer fun season ends, it's important for Buena Park not to
forget the death in Boisseranc Park that occurred early on, and to
heed the call of its police chief for a fireworks ban in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Fourth of July celebrants whose holidays aren't complete without
making their own sparks are crowding into five Orange County cities
that still allow so-called "safe and sane" fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   The proliferation of street fireworks makes those towns much
noisier during the holiday, so scofflaws with bottle rockets and
other dangerous fireworks that no cities allow also head for Buena
Park, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Stanton.That's what
thousands of people were doing at Boisseranc Park on July 4 when
9-year-old Xavier Morales of Anaheim was killed by a gunshot.</LD>
<TE>   The Buena Park spot is popular for family picnics and those who
want to set off their own fireworks, legal or otherwise. The result
is a law-enforcement headache that grows worse every year. The police
department fielded 130 fireworks complaints this year.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Gary Hicken blames the pandemonium caused by amateur
fireworks for creating the environment that left Xavier dead,
possibly the victim of someone who randomly shot off a gun as part of
the celebration. The gunshot went unnoticed in all the noise, and the
killer got away.</TE>
<TE>   The amateur displays might have had nothing to do with the fatal
shooting, but police have enough to do on Independence Day without
responding to scores of calls on fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   At least 45 people in the county were injured by fireworks in 2000
during the monthlong period including Independence Day. The injury
toll was second only to Los Angeles County and more than twice the
number in any other county. Sadly, more than a dozen injuries were
from legal fireworks sold at stands that nonprofit groups use to
raise money.</TE>
<TE>   The number of fires sparked by fireworks has fallen dramatically
since the mid-1980s, when cities began enforcing bans, but legal
fireworks have caused seven fires this year.</TE>
<TE>   Cities that consider safe and sane fireworks bans are barraged
with complaints from the fireworks industry and nonprofit groups that
raise funds by selling fireworks at licensed booths. So Buena Park
will feel that heat if it acts on Hicken's recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   The city is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to
the conviction of Xavier's killer. If fireworks were left to the
professionals, Buena Park might be using that money to fund nonprofit
groups instead of searching for a killer.</TE>
<TE>   The danger of death, injury and fire damage provides more than
enough reasons for Buena Park and the other holdouts to make this a
county free of amateur fireworks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's long-held reputation for solid middle-class affluence
is taking some hard hits these days.</LD>
<LD>   A census report released last week chronicled the move of
middle-class and upper-middle-class households out of the area, along
with a simultaneous rise in working-poor immigrant families that come
in at the bottom of the economy. The analysis helped explain why the
county's median household income dropped nearly 2% in the last
decade.</LD>
<LD>   Then a county advisory board announced that a third of the
children here live in poverty, most of them the children of working
parents. A fourth of them are so poor that they qualify for financial
help to get a $2 school meal in their tummies.</LD>
<TE>   A third report helped put it all in perspective. Where once people
thought poverty could be cured by keeping families together and
sending parents on welfare off to work, the study found that almost
half the poor children in California live with both parents, at least
one of whom works--but at a low-paid job with minimal benefits. Most
of California's poor youngsters have at least one immigrant parent.</TE>
<TE>   It's all a little startling for a county built on a pioneering
belief in perpetual growth.</TE>
<TE>   As a coastal community with a diverse economy, the party line once
went, the county would always be a little richer, a little better
educated, a little more sheltered from crowding and crime and hunger
than the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Now come the signs that such comforting thoughts don't hold true.
The days of comfort already are a distant dream for a substantial
portion of the population. The question is whether county residents
and leaders will ignore these signs in the hope they go away, or
transmute their way of looking at their own backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the solutions are beyond the county's reach. It's up to
lawmakers at the state and federal levels to work on making health
insurance more affordable and available.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government must either fix its failing immigration
policies or make up the difference to municipalities whose budgets
carry the burden of immigrant poverty.</TE>
<TE>   But local agencies both public and private must not set aside the
seriousness of the work to be done. The county's old patchwork of
middling though well-intentioned attempts to offer community clinics
and grocery giveaways cannot address poverty this big and pervasive.
The county's residents no longer can afford to think of poor people
as a minor phenomenon scattered somewhere beyond the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The politicians, business leaders and volunteers of Orange County
must draw up an aggressive and coordinated effort to offer a helping
hand to families that are striving, yet struggling.</TE>
<TE>   If the county's economic future is to be bright, these children
must be given a chance to help make that happen. They must be
well-nourished, healthy and educated for the job ahead.</TE>

<HD>Debating Library Service for Latinos in Santa Ana</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Latinos Finding Nada on Library Shelves," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   I am beginning to wonder if this is still America or just
beginning to become Mexico del Norte. How upside-down can this
political correctness get when it is bemoaned by Latino activists
that there are no, or not enough, Spanish-language books in the Santa
Ana Public Library, and soft-headed American political scientists
agree?</LD>
<LD>   The absurdity of this takes more shape when you wonder how many
books written in English there are in Mexican libraries for the
English-speaking Americans who live there, and how much the Mexican
librarians care.</LD>
<TE>   James Kerr</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was concerned to read the negative statements made regarding the
Santa Ana Public Library's commitment to serve its primarily Mexican
immigrant community.</TE>
<TE>   While I don't dispute the need for additional Spanish-language
materials, funding increases and a more relevant speakers program, I
challenge the notion that the "library system is out of touch with
residents in a city deemed the most Spanish-speaking of its size in
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   While I respect the opinions of friends and colleagues cited in
the article, two scholarly ethnographic studies and one independently
conducted staff survey conducted in the 1990s offer a different
perspective on the immigrant community's impressions, use and value
of this institution. The studies' findings are reported in "Immigrant
Politics and the Public Library" (Greenwood, 2001), a volume of
original research and scholarly articles I edited.</TE>
<TE>   As the principal investigator of one of these studies, which was
made possible through research grants from the California Library
Assn. and Cal State Long Beach, I can attest to the relevancy of the
public library to the Santa Ana community's immigrant population and
the commitment of the staff to serve immigrant users.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Public Library's focus on youth, a strategic
decision based on limited funding, is the real story here. The
enormous efforts that the library focuses on Santa Ana's children
should have been the highlight of this story. It saddens me that the
library's success in this critical area appears as an afterthought at
the end of the article. Overall, I feel the article discounts the

<LD>Re "Transportation Fix That Isn't," Commentary, Aug. 18:</LD>
<LD>   Hooray for Jack Mallinckrodt for sticking some pins in the
harebrained CenterLine proposal.</LD>
<LD>   If OCTA's directors' actual goal was to improve transit in the
county, we would have a far more rational and useful bus system that
would be good enough to lure folks from their cars.</LD>

<TE>   I have heard individuals call the CenterLine project a lot of
things. Robert Geiss of Lake Forest called it "a hole in the ground
into which you pour your billions." I find it almost comical that all
the voices that decry the CenterLine project as a waste of money, or
a non-fix to Orange County's traffic problems, seem to come from the
affluence of South County.</TE>
<TE>   These complaints are based more on the fear of an unsightly
elevated train platform running through their middle-income
neighborhoods than on concern over the effectiveness of light rail.
Statistically, the vast majority of public transportation riders are
low-income individuals who don't have the luxury of driving to their
jobs. Such individuals (you know, people who actually use public
transportation) will never complain that CenterLine is a waste of
money.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy for people who have no intention of ever taking public
transportation, in any form, to label an investment in it a waste.
But for those who rely on it for their very livelihood, the picture
is remarkably different.</TE>

<LD>Re "Schools' 'Emergency' Is Lack of Cheap Teachers," Letters, Aug.
25:</LD>
<LD>   John Rossmann is right to say that school systems want teachers on
the cheap--and experience costs. But he makes a misleading argument
about so-called emergency credentials. Many experienced people, after
years in industry, government and the military, decide to enter
teaching as a serious second career. Many are highly proven
performers with a wealth of knowledge and experience.</LD>
<LD>   In past years, these persons, judged to be competent and
knowledgeable in their respective fields--very often science and
math--could teach with a temporary credential by immediately
enrolling in an accredited teacher credential program. But the
current hysteria over credentials now makes this next to impossible
because of a sleight of hand that has led many to equate a credential
with competence.</LD>
<TE>   Consider a college instructor--without secondary school experience
or credentials--teaching math or science to incoming freshmen in the
fall. The college decides on his qualifications and does not require
any sort of teaching credential. Just three months earlier, this
instructor would have been judged "unqualified" to teach these same
students in their final semester in high school. This is the sort of
absurdity that the current teacher credentialing system leads to.</TE>

<TE>   Re "John Wayne's Security Is Too Loose for Comfort," Letters, Aug.
4:</TE>
<TE>   To the two letter writers who admonished John Wayne Airport for
"lax" security: Please keep quiet! You are trying to reverse a step
in the right direction. The fact that airport security lets elderly
people with hip replacements through without hassling them gives some
hope that maybe they are looking for real problems instead of looking
to provide the illusion of security, which has been the effort since
9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Air travel is much safer now, not because of metal detectors
finding knitting needles, fingernail clippers and the like, but
because the passengers will no longer allow a hijacking. The security
goal should be to help passengers by keeping bombs and high capacity
guns out of the cabins. The passengers would feel safer and even be
safer if they were allowed to carry the small knives and other tools
which used to be considered OK.</TE>

<LD>   I feel sorry for Cindy MacDonald's loss, but she and her family
refuse to face facts. Her son was not an informant for the Brea

informant before he went to the drug house where he was killed.</LD>

<LD>Re "Monitoring of Coastal Waters Is Questioned," Aug. 15:</LD>
<LD>   The newest study on coastal water quality confirms the questions
that cities, fire departments, homeowners associations, business
groups, apartment owners and real estate interests have raised
regarding the questionable need for more and more storm water and
urban runoff regulations.</LD>
<LD>   If coastal water quality is improving, as this study confirms, why
should society be asked to spend tens of billions of dollars, or even
hundreds of billions by some estimates, in the pursuit of minor
incremental improvements to water quality?</LD>
<TE>   If the old regulations are working, and this study confirms that
they are, why are water quality control boards asking homeowners and
businesses to pay the price to make storm drains pristine?</TE>
<TE>   Each new study raises more questions regarding the scientific
underpinnings of these new regulations, yet the water quality boards
continue to pursue harsher remedies to a problem that is clearly
overstated.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for these appointed boards to create reasonable
regulations that are based on science, not political or social
agendas.</TE>

are there to learn, not to be fashion plates.</LD>
<LD>   There is all this uproar about wearing the ID badges because "it
ruins my outfit." Assistant Principal Mick Wager says the badge is
"the same thing as a dress code." Why should the students make that
association when it is obvious that there is no "dress code"?</LD>

<LD>Re "Spending Isn't Best Measure of Caring," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   I don't see how John Campbell can equate limiting the "want list"
of his children raised with money and privilege with the basic
humanitarian needs of the poor. I contend, Mr. Campbell, it is
inhumane and heartless to promote a society in which the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer. Even with no increase in spending, if
the money the government spends on education were more equally
distributed, the poor would have more. The inequality of per-pupil
spending in school districts is a prime example. And when it comes to
health care, just how does eliminating the employer and "reconnecting
the patient with health care and its cost" empower the patient to pay
the bill?</LD>
<LD>   May I remind Mr. Campbell that the good Samaritan paid the bill
for the one who could not. He didn't just "connect" the victim with
the innkeeper. When Jesus said, "The poor you will have with you
always," he wasn't resigning himself to a permanent underclass. He
was bemoaning how the rich perpetuate the unequal distribution of
wealth. The best parent does not withhold basic sustenance from one
child to indulge another.</LD>

<LD>Re "Tougher Laws Are the Best Antidote to Drunk Drivers," Aug. 23:</LD>
<LD>   Tougher laws could be the best antidote to drunk drivers. But
while waiting for such laws to be passed, let us make other
life-saving environmental prevention strategies, which have been
proved to reduce the number of alcohol-related crashes, work for our
health and safety. Driving under the influence checkpoints, where
police randomly stop cars and look for intoxicated drivers, send a
clear message to the public that law enforcement is watching out for
impaired drivers.</LD>
<LD>   Communities that consistently use checkpoints have experienced
reductions in DUI incidents as much as eight times greater than
communities that depend on roving patrols, according to Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. An Orange County nonprofit, Community
Service-Project PATH, is gaining recognition for its free training on
responsible beverage service for restaurant and bar owners along with
their alcohol servers. Restaurant owners are beginning to see the
value of being trained how to spot false IDs, how to refuse a minor
admission, how to count and monitor drinks of guests, and how to
refuse service to an intoxicated guest. We would see fewer impaired
drivers on our streets if we had more DUI checkpoints and training.</LD>
<TE>   Lourdes Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I agree that tougher laws are the best antidote for
drunk drivers who kill. While it may give us a good deal of
satisfaction to lock up these miscreants and throw away the key, I am
skeptical that this is the most effective or, for that matter,
fairest way to deal with them. It seems to me that prevention would
be a better alternative to punishment to the extent that this is
possible. In this context, prevention means education and counseling
for alcoholics.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Proposition 36 was a big step forward in this respect.
A program similar to this should be available to alcoholics. Granted,
this could be expensive, but incarceration is even more expensive,
particularly when you consider the lost productivity of the convict.
Of course, a program like this needs to have teeth--severe
consequences for those who fail to comply. I have no quarrel with
that. I just think that there is lots of room for improvement in our
treatment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   As a specific example, offenders are usually ordered by the court
to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. But AA meetings are not for
everyone, for a variety of reasons. One problem is the religious
nature of AA; many people are not religious and find it difficult to
connect with the program. By offering more professional counseling
and perhaps some alternatives to AA (such as Rational Recovery, for
example), I think more alcoholics and drug addicts could be helped
out of their dependence. (Yes, Rational Recovery meetings are
currently allowed by the courts to substitute for AA, but Rational
Recovery meetings are few and far between. With better funding, more
such meetings could be created.)</TE>

<LD>Re " 'Keep Out' Echoes From O.C. Canyons," Aug. 22:</LD>
<LD>   NIMBYism is one of California's biggest hobbies. Everyone wants to
tell someone else what to do with their property. NIMBYs kept badly
needed power plants from being built in South Gate and the City of
Industry. NIMBYs belatedly killed an El Toro international airport
seven years after it was approved by voters. NIMBYs have thus far
stopped home building projects at Huntington Beach and Dana Point and
elsewhere for many, many years. And they wonder why housing costs are
unaffordable. Houses are so unaffordable thanks to restrictive
building codes, outrageous building fees and, perhaps worst of all,
NIMBYs sticking their noses into anything to do with other people's
property.</LD>

<TE>   The proposed home developments in Santiago Canyon would destroy
valuable canyon habitat. In one development, homeowners are then
"required" to build 4,000-to 10,000-square-foot homes and install
lawns within a year. The paradox is that the developer's marketing
plan will probably trumpet the canyon's scenic beauty and rustic
charm. Then the homeowners will be required by the homeowners
association to install a lawn, which will conflict entirely with the
beauty of the canyons, which are rich with native oaks and scrub.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the large homes and lawns will require much water,
which is in short supply in Southern California. If homeowners are
required by the homeowners association to maintain their lawns, then
pesticides will likely be used, creating toxic runoff that flows into
the creeks. The wild nature of the canyons has always been part of
their appeal, and it is slowly being destroyed and cannot be
regained.</TE>

<LD>Re "Where Gang Members Must Behave--and Do," Aug. 19:</LD>
<LD>   The title gave me the belief that there might be some great things
happening at the Joplin youth detention facility. But alas, the story
let me down when there was absolutely no evidence that this claim is
even remotely true.</LD>
<LD>   My second comment is, what motivated this story? Is it a
coincidence that it comes immediately after Orange County lost a
critical lawsuit brought against them for ignoring the law in order
to develop the Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy right next door to
Joplin? Could it be that the county is concerned about its ability to
justify the astronomical cost of operating Joplin?</LD>
<TE>   I am beyond a state of shock from what I have learned of the
fiscal irresponsibility tied to both facilities. Many of you may
remember that during the county bankruptcy, Joplin was a priority for
closure because of its high cost and the limited number it serves.
Joplin has never made economic sense, so the county needs to turn up
the propaganda machine to justify it somehow.</TE>

<TE>   While not wishing in any way to demean the well-intentioned
activities of the Orange County Probation Department in dealing with
recalcitrant and troubled youth, there is one element described in
the recent article pertaining to the Joplin Youth Center that perhaps
deserves broader implementation.</TE>
<TE>   As required of the Joplin residents, we should require that
certain members of Orange County government, such as director of
planning Thomas B. Mathews and staffer Frank McGill, as well as
Supervisor Todd Spitzer himself, wear color-coded shirts signifying
their current status and privilege. Because of their recent
shenanigans, including flouting of environmental law and the illegal
grading pertaining to the euphemistically named Rancho Potrero
"Leadership" Academy site in Trabuco Canyon, lowly yellow shirts
would be in order, since these individuals in government continue to
present "special disciplinary challenges."</TE>
<TE>   This would serve both as a minor act of contrition and as a
warning to a generally unsuspecting public that the latter is dealing
with an unscrupulous bunch of bureaucrats that has little regard for
law or for Orange County citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   John Sefton</TE>
<TE>   Trabuco Canyon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This leadership academy project was not based on sound economic,
social or environmental policy. It was indeed a waste of money. The
county has everything it needs for a youth facility, with much of the
infrastructure already built, at the former airbase. Have you seen
all the housing there?</TE>
<TE>   Not only would a youth facility here make economic sense, it would
make social sense as well. The youth could be used in work programs
for the parks planned there.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of building up Joplin, it should be incorporated into
O'Neill Park. The county could possibly use Joplin and the lower area
as an outdoor camp for Orange County schools.</TE>

<LD>Re "Farm Workers Urge Davis to Sign Binding Arbitration Bill," Aug.
11:</LD>
<LD>   The article states: "While the [union] views arbitration as a
boon, farm groups say it could bankrupt already-struggling growers."
However, no numbers are provided as to how many struggling growers
there may be.</LD>
<LD>   Farm workers are struggling and have been for decades while making
growers extremely rich. Jose Garcia said he earns less in
inflation-adjusted dollars than he did as a teenager. On the other
hand, the entire world knows wealthy growers live as kings and queens
surrounded by opulence.</LD>
<TE>   One grower has recently been reported to have made $120 million in
the past 30 years. By Gov. Davis approving binding arbitration, the
"struggling growers" (give me a break) might have to pay only $20,000
more per year. If they would go bankrupt for doing so, then they
shouldn't be in the grape business.</TE>

<HD>4 Held in Huge Drug Seizure</HD>
<DH>Crime: In one of the year's biggest local narcotics busts,
deputies find $1.2 million worth of heroin, cocaine and
methamphetamine in home near Point Mugu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the second-largest drug bust this year in Ventura County,
sheriff's deputies have arrested four Oxnard residents and seized
more than $1 million worth of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests ended a monthlong investigation that started when
deputies received a tip that illegal drugs were being sold from a
house on rural Dufau Road near the Point Mugu naval base, officials
said late Friday.</LD>
<LD>   According to Sgt. Bob Garcia, undercover detectives were able to
purchase several small quantities of drugs at the house during the
last few weeks. On Thursday afternoon, deputies set up a stakeout.</LD>
<TE>   About 1 p.m. Thursday, deputies pulled over a car that was leaving
the home, arrested three men and seized a small amount of illegal
drugs, Garcia said. Taken into custody were Juan Cortez, 38, Hildardo
Cardona, 61, and Francisco Hernandez, 23.</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining a search warrant for the home, deputies arrested
Maria Elena Aguirre, 25, and took her two young children into
protective custody, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the home, deputies seized 19 pounds of cocaine, 6.8 pounds
of heroin and 6.5 pounds of methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   The approximate street value of the drugs, according to Garcia,
was $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The drugs had been divided into various weights, including kilos,
and were packaged for sale, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "The detectives were not expecting to find the quantities they
did, particularly of heroin," Garcia said in a written statement.
"The seizure of heroin was particularly large as most seizures are
often measured in grams and ounces."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the drugs were being sold throughout western
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Besides drugs, deputies seized scales, packaging materials,
written records about drug transactions and $50,000 in alleged drug
proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   The four suspects were booked into Ventura County Jail, each on
suspicion of possessing drugs for sale and transportation of drugs.
Cortez and Hernandez, considered the primary players, were being held
on $1-million bail each and the bail for Cardona and Aguirre was set
at $50,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   The seizure marks the second major drug operation uncovered in the
county this year. In early August, a Camarillo couple were arrested
on suspicion of participating in a methamphetamine ring after
deputies seized more than 30 pounds of the drug at three houses in
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Escobar Marron, 35, remains in jail without bail and his
girlfriend, Sandra Mares Garcia, 31, has since posted bail.</TE>
<TE>   During Marron's arrest, deputies found 12 ounces of
methamphetamine inside his pants. At his home, inside a safe encased
in concrete and hidden under floorboards, deputies allegedly found
another 8 pounds of methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also searched two Oxnard houses that were believed to
be part of the operation and found 22 pounds of methamphetamine and
15 gallons of methamphetamine oil, which is used to make the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities valued the confiscated drugs and a clandestine lab
that was also seized at nearly $2 million.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Gordon, 84; Conflict Resolution Trainer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Gordon, a clinical psychologist who developed a system to
train parents, teachers and businessmen in no-lose conflict
resolution to improve relationships in families, schools and the
workplace, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon, founder of Gordon Training International, which has
tutored more than 1 million people in 40 nations, died Monday in the
San Diego County town of Solana Beach from prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Once a president of the California Psychological Assn., Gordon
developed his technique in the 1950s while working as a management
consultant with Edward Glaser &amp; Associates in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   When he moved into private practice amid the anti-establishment
hippie and drug culture of the 1960s, he began teaching paying
couples--beginning with a class for 14 parents in a Pasadena
cafeteria--to use his methods to deal with their rebellious
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Eschewing both authoritative and permissive approaches to
parenting, Gordon advised moms and dads to practice nonjudgmental
"active listening" and express their own needs in statements
beginning with "I" rather than an accusative "you." Finally, he said,
the parent should encourage the child to propose a solution to
compare with the parent's solution, and then they should arrive at a
"no-lose" compromise satisfactory to both.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Gordon described his plan in the book "Parent
Effectiveness Training: The No-Lose Way to Raise Responsible
Children."</TE>
<TE>   "If parents could learn only one thing from this book," he wrote
halfway through the text, "I wish it were this: Each and every time
they force a child to do something by using their power or authority,
they deny that child a chance to learn self-discipline and
self-responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   A Times reviewer praised Gordon's effort as "very readable" and
added: "This is an exciting book revealing new techniques and
offering testimony that this is a workable philosophy in modern
homes."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1976 follow-up volume, "P.E.T. in Action," Gordon wrote about
parents' experience with his techniques, but it was the original
how-to book that remained most popular.</TE>
<TE>   "Many parents confuse 'listening' and 'talking,' " Gordon told a
Times columnist in 1979. "In fact, when children are upset or
troubled, most parents don't listen at all. They moralize and preach,
criticize and give advice."</TE>
<TE>   The original book, revised in 2000, has sold more than 5 million
copies in 33 languages, according to Gordon Training International
spokesmen in Solana Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Applying the model to schools and business, Gordon also wrote the
books "Teacher Effectiveness Training" and "Leader Effectiveness
Training."</TE>
<TE>   For more than three decades, he trained thousands of people to
teach his conflict-resolution, relationship-building skills in
eight-week courses that spread from Pasadena around the world.</TE>
<TE>   His work led to his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997,
1998 and 1999. The California Psychological Assn. and the American
Psychological Foundation gave him lifetime achievement awards.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Paris, Ill., on March 11, 1918, Gordon earned his
bachelor's degree at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., and his
master's at Ohio State University. After service in the Army Air
Forces during World War II, he earned a doctorate from the University
of Chicago and taught there for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon is survived by his wife, Linda Adams, who will continue his
company's work as president; two daughters, Michelle Adams of
Carlsbad and Judy Verret of Birch Bay, Wash.; two granddaughters; and
one great-granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   A celebration of Gordon's life is being planned for Saturday. The
family said he requested that, instead of flowers, memorial donations
be made to his favorite charities, Prevent Child Abuse America, 200
S. Michigan Ave. 17th Floor, Chicago, IL 60604-2404, or the Carter
Center, Office of Development, 1 Copenhill, Atlanta, GA 30307.</TE>

<HD>A Faith Flows Across Time</HD>
<DH>Religion: At an Aliso Viejo temple, three generations of a
family participate in an unusual form of the Jewish rite of passage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In front of a teary-eyed congregation, Chaim Pollak, a survivor of
Nazi concentration and labor camps, passed the Torah to his daughter,
Celia. The sacred scrolls containing Hebrew Scripture had been pieced
together from four Torahs burned by German forces during World War
II.</LD>
<LD>   Celia then handed the Torah to her eldest daughter, Estee. And
Estee's three sisters each took a turn holding it, a symbolic act to
show the Jewish faith being passed from generation to generation.</LD>
<LD>   "It was very emotional," said Chaim Pollak, 73. "We tried very
hard to give them faith. We did our best."</LD>
<TE>   In a twist on the usual Bar (for a boy) or Bat (for a girl)
Mitzvah ceremony, Celia, 47, and her four children together became
B'not Mitzvah ("Daughters of the Commandment") after helping lead the
Saturday morning Shabbat service at Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo.
Normally, one or two adolescents at a time go through the ceremony, a
rite of passage usually done about age 13 that shows a fluency in
Hebrew and knowledge of Jewish traditions and signals full membership
in the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in Allen Krause's 35-year career as a rabbi
that five family members went through the ceremony at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "You fill us with feelings of great hope for the Jewish people,"
he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Celia Pollak, born in Israel and now living in Laguna Niguel, was
raised in an Orthodox congregation, where Bat Mitzvah ceremonies were
not held because women could not take lead roles in the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, the single mother had never considered having her
daughters become B'not Mitzvah (the plural of Bat Mitzvah), though
her family had attended Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue that
encourages the ceremony, for a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't give it much thought," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But then her third daughter, 14-year-old Rachel, announced that
she wanted to go through the ceremony. Celia Pollak pointed out that
if she held a Bat Mitzvah for one daughter, she should make the
opportunity available to the others: Estee, 21; Sarah, 16; and
Hannah, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughters liked the idea, but added another wrinkle that took
the form of an ultimatum.</TE>
<TE>   "We told her, 'You either do this with us too, or we're not doing
it,' " Estee recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Celia said she initially hoped her daughters' enthusiasm for her
participation would fade.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of just ignored it, hoping it would go away," she said.
"It's a lot of work, and it's scary. But the girls kept nudging me
and bugging me."</TE>
<TE>   Her rabbi also did his part the moment he heard the idea. "I
jumped on it immediately," Krause said. "I didn't want Celia or her
daughters to get away. I think the health of a synagogue is
reflective on how well it passes tradition to the next generation. So
this is very symbolic for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Pollaks didn't have to do much additional preparation for the
ceremony. Having attended religious school for years, they knew
Hebrew and were familiar with the ceremony's other requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the children are straight-A students, and Estee, a senior at
UC Santa Cruz, hopes to become a rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   The five Pollak females divvied up parts of the Saturday service,
taking turns reading, praying and chanting in Hebrew. Junior high,
high school and college friends waved and gave thumbs-up signs each
time one of them completed a difficult passage.</TE>
<TE>   "I refer to them as the power tribe," said Shula Kalir-Merton, the
synagogue's cantor. "We're very motivated, sharp and strong women.
And they have a love for Judaism and take pride in their identity as
Jewish women."</TE>

<LD>A Santa Ana woman jumped to her death from a freeway overpass Friday
night after removing her shoes and eyeglasses and setting them neatly
aside, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Catherine Suarez, 30, leaped from the McFadden Avenue overpass
into the southbound lanes of the Costa Mesa Freeway, a Tustin police

<DL></DL>
<LD>A three-alarm fire destroyed three mobile homes Saturday, causing
more than $180,000 in damage to the structures and their contents.
Anaheim Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said the fire began
in a row of juniper trees and spread to the homes.</LD>
<LD>   About 60 firefighters from Anaheim, Orange and the Orange County
Fire Authority responded to the blaze, fearing that it could spread
to other units at the Friendly Village mobile home park in the 5800
block of East La Palma Avenue. The fire was brought under control in
46 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   A pregnant woman who fell while running from the fire was taken to
a local hospital for observation, Sabol said. A man who tried to
extinguish the blaze with a garden hose was treated for chest pains
at the scene by paramedics, but he refused to be transported to a
hospital, she said.</LD>

<HD>Chilling Effect of September Send-Offs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not that I need reminders that time marches on (the house is fully
stocked with mirrors), but here comes September to drive the point
home. T. S. Eliot called April the cruelest month, but had anyone
thought to press him about September, he no doubt would have called
it the most wistful.</LD>
<LD>   There's no mystery to it, especially to those of us who grew up
outside the confines of California, where September may seem pretty
much like August, not to mention January or May.</LD>
<LD>   For us, September meant it was time to get a move on. The peal of
the first school bell in early September was as much symbolic as
real. Whether you were a first-grader or a freshman, the siren sound
from the schoolhouse or campus summoned you to the new uncertain
adventure that lay ahead. Instinctively, you knew you would be
different nine months down the road.</LD>
<TE>   That sensation, so real in the Midwest where I grew up, feels less
pronounced here in California where I've spent the last 16 summers.</TE>
<TE>   I confess to missing that feeling, even though I've made the
typical Californian's bargain of accepting 70-degree temperatures in
December in exchange for the changing of the seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But as dulled as the ol' nostalgia membranes may have been in
recent years, they're rustling again, if only vicariously.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a beloved cousin from my Nebraska boyhood spent a week
in Orange County with his wife and two sons, both in their 20s. The
visit was to help elder son Scott, 29 and a Ph.D., set up
housekeeping as he begins his full-time teaching career at Cal State
Fullerton. He needed to buy a car, buy a bed, get some furniture,
learn his way around campus, meet his colleagues, start living his
new life in a new town.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, a longtime friend is here from New Jersey with
another young man in tow--his 18-year-old son, Dan, who will enroll
at CalArts in Valencia. Dan has designs on becoming a drummer in a
jazz ensemble. His father confesses to being a wreck, knowing that at
the end of the 3,000-mile drive to California, he'll be saying
goodbye to a little boy who's not so little anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a manual somewhere that tells parents how to handle these
moments?</TE>
<TE>   My Nebraska cousin and his wife are semi-experts, having already
sent Scott and his brother off in past Septembers. And sure, Scott
probably could have survived his arrival in Orange County without his
parents' presence. But I find it kind of touching that they came,
anyway, and that he's already phoned them a number of times back in
Nebraska. During the week they were here, no one needed to say aloud
that we grasped the momentousness of Scott surveying the landscape on
the eve of his teaching career.</TE>
<TE>   As for my Jersey pal, well, this will be virgin territory. Dan is
the older of my friend's two children; sending the first-born off to
college won't be easy. I'm already telling myself not to bring out
the picture I have of Dan as an infant in his mother's arms. But I
will spend our entire time together telling my friend what a fabulous
town Valencia is.</TE>
<TE>   History tells us that young and not-so-young alike survive these
September passages. My best evidence comes from reeling in the
memories from 35 years to an emotionally fragile 17-year-old college
freshman who missed his mommy and daddy but somehow found his dorm
room at Nebraska U. and made it to class all by himself. I say this
with certainty: If that kid could make it, anybody can.</TE>
<TE>   If memory serves, so did his parents.</TE>
<TE>   So will it be for my cousin's son and my friend's son.</TE>
<TE>   The young bucks' task now is to enjoy themselves and celebrate
their youth in the perpetual summertime that is California.</TE>
<TE>   It is only we elders who will dwell on the coming autumn and
wonder whether, California or not, things seem a little chillier
already.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Janusz Bardach, 83, a Polish immigrant who spent five years in a
Siberian prison camp and later became one of the most respected
plastic surgeons in the world, died Aug. 16 in Iowa City, Iowa, of
pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   He pioneered the Bardach palatoplasty, a surgical technique for
repairing cleft lips and palates that reduced the number of required
surgeries, improved speech and reduced scarring.</LD>
<LD>   Bardach retired in 1991, after leading the facial and
reconstructive surgery program at the University of Iowa College of
Medicine. He wrote more than 200 scientific articles and 12 books on
plastic surgery.</LD>
<TE>   But he also wrote, with the help of Kathleen Gleeson, a moving
account of his Soviet imprisonment, "Man Is Wolf to Man: Surviving
the Gulag," published by UC Press in 1998. Bardach was sentenced to
hard labor after an accident in which, as a Soviet Army draftee, he
was driving a tank when it turned onto its side.</TE>
<TE>   Bardach was born in Odessa, Ukraine, and moved to Poland as an
infant. When Germany and the Soviet Union divided Poland, he again
came under Soviet rule. After his release from the gulag, he
practiced plastic surgery in Poland until he moved to the U.S. in
1972.</TE>

instruments by 1977.</LD>
<LD>   That same year, he founded the Federal Music Society, an
organization dedicated to performing music from the Colonial-Federal
period. The group's 26 players used instruments in Selch's collection
to perform in more than 70 concerts.</LD>
<TE>   Born in South Royalton, Vt., Selch grew up in West Winfield, N.Y.,
and graduated from Hamilton College. He later earned a master's
degree in radio-television production from Syracuse University.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1955
to 1974 as a broadcast supervisor and media specialist. Selch also
was the owner, editor and publisher of Ovation, a monthly magazine
about classical music, from 1983 to 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He produced the Broadway musical "Play Me a Country Song" in 1982,
and in the last 10 years was involved in a series of American Music
Festivals at Illinois Wesleyan University.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Ridgelines Heats Up in Rural L.A.</HD>
<DH>Valley: Residents accuse the city of bowing to developer
who wants to build homes on hills near Foothill Freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In some ways, the northeast corner of Los Angeles is a throwback to
the old West.</LD>
<LD>   The rugged crests of the San Gabriel and Verdugo mountains frame
chaparral-covered canyons unadorned by buildings. Residents astride
horses lope along country roads. Chickens strut through dusty yards
on multi-acre lots. Urban trappings such as street lights, curbs and
gutters are rarities.</LD>
<LD>   Many outsiders passing through this part of the San Fernando
Valley on the broad, lazy curve of the Foothill Freeway have no idea
that they are within Los Angeles city limits, said Elaine Brown, vice
president of the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one of the few places in Los Angeles County where you feel
like you're in the country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But in this bucolic setting, words like "meddling" and
"blindsided" are being uttered as residents dig in their heels for a
duel over preserving their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and other community activists fear that if developer
Whitebird Inc. of Nevada is allowed to build homes along the ridges
of nearly 1,000 hilly acres it owns, the rural setting in Sunland,
Tujunga, Sun Valley, Shadow Hills and Lake View Terrace is destined
to follow the urbanized path of neighboring Glendale. "We have a lot
of developers buying up property here," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say it's not just Whitebird's development plans that
bother them. Whitebird, in fact, has not submitted a formal
development proposal to the city. What alarms them is Whitebird's
effort--which has, so far, been successful--to persuade city
officials to ease development restrictions in a proposed preservation
plan for the area that's been in the works for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "As we approached our finalized plan, Whitebird got hold of it and
started meddling with it," Brown said. "They're a real thorn in our
sides."</TE>
<TE>   The plan arose from a 1998 City Council vote designating the area
as an irreplaceable visual resource. The council told the Planning
Department to draft development restrictions on prominent ridges
visible from the Foothill Freeway and from long stretches of Big
Tujunga Canyon Road, Foothill Boulevard, La Tuna Canyon Road, Sunland
Boulevard and Wentworth Street.</TE>
<TE>   Local residents had informally been working on such a preservation
plan since 1983. At the top of their wish list was a prohibition
against construction on or near ridges to preserve the natural look
of the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown and others say Whitebird lobbied city planners behind
closed doors to reduce the protections that homeowner groups had
drafted in a series of community meetings. The residents hope to
persuade a City Council committee to reverse the Planning
Commission's changes before the full council votes on the plan this
month. Whitebird owner Richard Percell said his company did not do
anything underhanded. "We did the same thing the community did. We
gave our input. We did it through professionals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Jack Rubens, said the community groups "completely
rewrote the plan" at least twice to severely limit development.</TE>
<TE>   "We were taken aback. They had blindsided us," he said, adding
that he raised only "generic concerns" with the city Planning
Department while it was reviewing the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Planning Director Bob Sutton said that although private
meetings took place with the developer, everyone's voice was heard.
"We got last-minute stuff from everybody. We got it from all sides."</TE>
<TE>   Sutton said he changed the community's draft to avoid the legal
thicket of a "takings" issue, the term applied when developers sue
because development restrictions substantially reduce the use or
value of property. Courts have ruled against such limits.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunland resident Greg Valencia and others said they felt duped
when the Planning Commission on July 25 sided with Whitebird's
request to define ridgelines in a way that allows construction on at
least one prominent crest as well as within a few feet of the top of
any ridge.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could believe it. Everyone was just in shock," Valencia
said.</TE>
<TE>   A key provision sought by the community groups was a buffer zone
free of any structures within 50 vertical feet of a view-protected
ridge. The Planning Commission said roofs of structures whose
foundations are outside the buffer zone can reach just below the
crest, but residents said they thought all along that nothing could
protrude into the buffer zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Being able to see 5 or 6 feet of the ridgeline is not ridgeline
protection," said Bill Eick, land-use chairman of the Shadow Hills
Property Owners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Crouch, who heads the Canyon Area Preservation homeowner
group, said he resents anyone who seeks a view from their home at the
expense of the area's scenery.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of homes perched on the ridges," he said. "And the
fact is, it's too much already."</TE>
<TE>   Percell said he's been trying to address residents' concerns. He
reduced the scope of his plan from 375 homes to 280. He's thinking of
clustering them on about a third of his property, which straddles the
Foothill Freeway at La Tuna Canyon Road, and donating the rest as
open space.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to respect the wishes of the majority of the
community," he said. "To add more constraints would prohibit innocent
people from doing anything with their properties," such as having
chimneys or gazebos in the buffer zone.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee will
review the Planning Commission's decision Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, who represents the area and sits on the
committee, supports the residents' fight, said her legislative aide,
Matt Szabo.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has made it clear what areas should not be
developed, and Councilwoman Greuel intends to support them on that
issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The full council is scheduled to vote on the preservation plan
Sept. 18.</TE>

<LD>A few days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Ventura neurosurgeon
Moustapha Abou-Samra was anxiously awaiting the arrival of his
college-age daughter at a near-empty Phoenix airport terminal. A
policeman stopped to chat.</LD>
<LD>   He was looking for Arabs and Muslims, the officer said, unaware
that he was talking with an Arab Muslim.</LD>
<LD>   At Abou-Samra's hotel, a new acquaintance told the startled
surgeon that Arab Americans should turn themselves in to authorities
or, at least, volunteer to spy on their countries of origin.</LD>
<TE>   It has been that kind of year for Abou-Samra. Ironic. Unsettling.
Disarming. Threatening.</TE>
<TE>   "Since September 11, things are different," said Abou-Samra, whose
dapper Mediterranean appearance could pass for European. "I have in
some situations not mentioned my name, a name of which I'm proud, in
order to avoid conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Abou-Samra, 55, is an immigrant success story--perhaps Ventura
County's most prominent neurosurgeon, past president of the county
Medical Society and a major donor to local arts and charities since
moving here in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   His five children reflect the American melting pot; he proposed to
his Irish Catholic wife, Joanie, on her 20th birthday not long after
arriving in New Jersey in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   An industrial-sized U.S. flag flies from a pole at the family's
hilltop home in Ventura. He is a Dodger fan and a runner entered in
the New York Marathon. They own a hay and pecan ranch in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Two cultures, two religions. Abou-Samra's surgical office
adjoining Community Memorial Hospital reflects the blend. It is
adorned with two U.S. flags and a multi-hued rendition of the Statue
of Liberty by artist Peter Max. A bookcase holds both a Koran and a
Bible. A crystal calligraphy work spelling "Allah" was a gift from
his sister in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor is an unabashed U.S. patriot, and he attends a Catholic
church with his family. He is also an Arab and a Muslim, descending
directly and proudly, he says, from the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   But after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon nearly a year ago, Abou-Samra was forced to reconsider what
it means to be an Arab in America.</TE>
<TE>   It's a question many of the nation's about 3 million Arab
Americans--fewer than half of whom are Muslim--have struggled with
since 19 terrorists made them suspect on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Abou-Samra's brother, Said, a plastic surgeon in New
Jersey, was tarred by hospital rumors that his assets had been frozen
by federal investigators. And the Islamic Center his brother supports
lost donations from people who had contributed for years, Abou-Samra
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They feared they'd be linked to terrorism," he said. "That is a
real concern: To worry about giving money to your church is bad,
especially in a country like ours."</TE>
<TE>   Recent government infringement of civil liberties bothers
Abou-Samra the most--suspects detained without charge, racial
profiling by law enforcement, invasive electronic surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, a lot of things have happened in the name of
homeland security and fighting terrorism," he said. "We cannot allow
that to happen, or this country becomes something it is not supposed
to be."</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem fostered not just by last year's attacks, he said,
but by a general ignorance of Arab cultures.</TE>
<TE>   The situation Arab Americans face now is not so different from
what Jewish Americans and Japanese Americans endured a few decades
ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know who we are, what we stand for and what we
want," Abou-Samra wrote in a letter to his niece after the attacks,
challenging her to become a community leader in Los Angeles. "They
have no clue what makes us tick. And, as long as we are an unknown
entity, yes, let's use the word--'alien'--we will be treated with
mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   "We are educated, family-oriented, loyal, patriotic and very
reliable," he said. "We should show others that ours is a good way."</TE>
<TE>   Abou-Samra has spent three decades trying to be as American as his
next-door neighbor. Moustapha, which means "the chosen one" in
Arabic, is often shortened by friends to a nickname, Moose, or Uncle
Moose to his nieces and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   He became a U.S. citizen on Emancipation Day years ago in San
Antonio, Texas, hoping to vote for Gerald Ford for president.</TE>
<TE>   "He just paced the floor because he wanted to vote so badly,"
Joanie Abou-Samra recalled. "And the day he became a citizen, he went
to the oldest boot store in downtown San Antonio and bought his first
pair of cowboy boots. He wore them to work every day."</TE>
<TE>   Abou-Samra thinks of himself as an American first. His father was
an international trader, and his mother, he said, was the first woman
to attend the University of Damascus, where she earned a degree in
math. His grandfather helped establish the Syrian educational system
after French colonialists left in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   "Our heritage is important to us," Abou-Samra said. "But we are
here in the U.S., and we have the same concerns as our neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   All five of the Abou-Samra children have both Arab and anglicized
names: Omar Brian, 25, Leyla Jane, 24, Jason Chafik, 22, Jamil Susan,
21, and Patricia Riad, 18. None speaks Arabic, but they have been
taught their father's native culture and have visited the Middle East
three times.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, they spent a month in Syria and Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   So one of Abou-Samra's most immediate concerns after the Twin
Towers fell was how his children would deal with the blame being cast
by some on Arabs and Muslims in general.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this congressman from Louisiana, saying we should round
up all the people who wear diapers on their heads. My kids were upset
and vocal about not treating Arabs badly," Abou-Samra said. "I sent
an e-mail telling them that their frustration was appropriate, but
they should be careful when articulating to those they don't know
that this [bias] is anti-American. It was a difficult and unsettling
time for us."</TE>
<TE>   The father says his children have not been personally mistreated.
But thoughtless words have stung.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all just really disturbing," said Jamil, a college
sophomore who will spend the fall semester in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to write a history of the Lebanese civil war and stay in
quarters at Sacred Heart Hospital, where her father was the first
Muslim doctor in 1971, the family says.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know I'm Arab--I'm very white and Irish like my
mom--so they say ridiculous things," Jamil said. "I'm going to
Lebanon, and someone actually said, 'Hopefully, there won't be any
Arabs on your plane.' Which is ridiculous, since I'm going to an Arab
country."</TE>
<TE>   But Moustapha and Joanie Abou-Samra have also found themselves
worrying unnecessarily for their children.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, they feared that Omar's best friend and college
roommate might withdraw his invitation to serve as best man at his
large Jewish wedding.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my parents don't want us to ever be hurt by anything,"
Omar said. "They're protective in a good way. And I think maybe it
crossed their minds that having an Arab name in a roomful of 200 of
New York's finest Jews would make me nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "But people were very supportive of me. And the wedding was
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Omar, a third-year law student, said he has been struck most since
the attacks by the nation's heightened interest in Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day there would be an article about how this [Arab] person
or that person had been treated, and it was not necessarily
positive," he said. "There is a greater awareness of what it means to
be an Arab in this country."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a Santa Clara School of Law professor reached
out with compassion, Omar said.</TE>
<TE>   "[He] made a very sincere and nice comment about treating Arabs as
they would treat anybody else," Omar said. "It showed me how
sensitive other people could be. And I have never been discriminated
against."</TE>
<TE>   That tracks, generally, with his father's experience in America.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-nine years ago, when Joanie Morrison asked her parish
priest in New Jersey to marry her and Moustapha, the priest quizzed
the well-schooled Syrian on Catholicism and then noted the future
bride's ignorance of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Father [James] MacConnell told me I needed to learn my husband's
religion," she recalled. "We've tried to raise our children the same
way, teaching them there is a common thread to all religion, sort of
a Golden Rule, and that some people just use religion the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   A desperate situation in 1978 reemphasized for the young couple a
foundation of American culture and of most religions.</TE>
<TE>   Moustapha had enrolled for six months of extra training in
neurology at the University of Minnesota. But the student, his
pregnant wife and their toddler son could find nothing to rent for
the $300 a month they could afford.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they considered abandoning the training, a couple that had
asked $450 a month for a fine old house called to say they would
leave two months early for a summer retreat so the Abou-Samras could
use their home.</TE>
<TE>   The couple even helped the Abou-Samras unload their U-Haul that
evening and refused to take the cut-rate $300 rent until the end of
the month.</TE>
<TE>   "What we didn't know was they'd been listening to Rev. Robert
Schuler preach from the Crystal Cathedral [in California] that
morning," Joanie said. "And he said you don't have to go to Africa to
be a missionary, just look around and find someone in need."</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the September attacks, Moustapha Abou-Samra told
that story at Thacher School in Ojai, which his youngest daughter
once attended.</TE>
<TE>   "Every step of the way, I was afforded opportunities I never would
have dreamed possible in my land of birth, Syria," he told the
students.</TE>
<TE>   But then he warned about the potential erosion of Arab Americans'
civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were to happen," he said, "the terrorists would have
won."</TE>

<HD>Gem of a Hotel Retains Its Luster</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula: The Glen Tavern Inn is spruced up and reopened
after being closed for 10 years. City hopes it will enhance the
area's image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine months into the restoration of the Glen Tavern Inn, new owner
Steve Talley is confident he can return the historic Santa Paula
hotel to its former splendor.</LD>
<LD>   Once a haven for movie stars and oil tycoons, the 46-room hotel
recently reopened after being closed for 10 years. City officials and
local historians have great expectations for its future.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of affection for this hotel in the community,"
said historian Mitch Stone of San Buenaventura Research Associates in
Santa Paula.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Skeels, interim city manager and longtime fire chief, was
equally enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Glen Tavern was originally built it was the crown jewel
of Santa Paula. It will be a big plus for the city when the hotel is
completed."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the sprawling three-story hotel at 134 N. Mill St.
is rich with tales of visits by celebrities, including Mary Pickford,
Clark Gable, Harry Houdini and Rin Tin Tin.</TE>
<TE>   During its 91-year history, the Craftsman-style inn, with Tudor
influences, has been used as a hotel, a boardinghouse for female war
employees during World War II and a college dormitory. It was built
in 1911 by a group of Santa Paula investors who gave it the city's
surrogate name, Glen City, referring to the green glens of the Santa
Clara River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Constructed of Oregon redwood, the 20,000-square-foot building was
designed by architects Sumner Hunt and Silas Burns and is one of only
three hotels designated Ventura County historic landmarks. It is also
on the National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Tavern Inn has a restaurant and bar, swimming pool and
sitting room, an antique piano and the original sandstone fireplace,
which measures 17 feet across.</TE>
<TE>   A larger bar with two apartments overhead was added in the early
1950s. Though it sits adjacent to the inn, it was not built in the
same architectural style--something Talley plans to change.</TE>
<TE>   A decline in the economy led to the inn's sale in 1989 by local
investor Mel Cummings to Tokyo International College for $2.1
million. It then served as a dormitory for Japanese students taking
classes in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Talley and a silent investor whom he declined to identify bought
the property in November for $590,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They had wanted $1.3 million, so they basically gave it me. I'll
probably have to put another $500,000 into it, but I love it," said
Talley, who owns interests in several other properties.</TE>
<TE>   The work required to make the inn operational again was daunting,
but Talley said he and his son, David, 6, have fallen in love with
the inn and the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never worked so hard and never had so much fun in my life,"
said Talley, 50, of Santa Barbara. He hopes to move to Ventura County
soon.</TE>
<TE>   The inn remained closed for the first three months of Talley's
ownership, while new gas and water lines were installed. Each guest
room has a distinct design and seven are outfitted with whirlpool
tubs. The rooms are being refurbished with new paint and carpets, and
the kitchen and pool house are being renovated.</TE>
<TE>   Talley started taking reservations in March for the 17 rooms
currently available for guests. He runs the inn with a manager, two
maids and a maintenance man.</TE>
<TE>   A wrought iron gazebo was added on the expansive front lawn, which
will eventually be offered for weddings at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that if people get married in the gazebo, they will
stay in the hotel and use the restaurant for their receptions," said
Talley who is in the market for a chef.</TE>
<TE>   The inn, at the corner of Mill and Santa Barbara streets, is a
block away from downtown Santa Paula and across the street from the
train depot.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council recently voted to spend $1 million to enhance the
railway plaza and plans to cut off traffic on Mill Street between
Santa Barbara Street and Railroad Avenue. The train platform will be
extended and a public park added.</TE>
<TE>   Public Works Director Norm Wilkinson, who is also the city
engineer, said most of the money for the project is coming from state
and federal grants.</TE>
<TE>   "Having that park right across the street from the hotel can only
be good for business," Talley said. "We've been doing pretty well
with reservations so far, but every little bit helps."</TE>

<HD>91 Toll-Lane Deal Passes, Goes to Davis</HD>
<DH>Transit: Bill would let OCTA buy express route, allow
freeway widening. Governor's noncommittal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question of whether the Orange County Transportation Authority
can buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes was put before Gov. Gray
Davis on Saturday after the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed
legislation allowing the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which appeared in jeopardy last week when two key
legislators pulled their support in a squabble over amendments,
passed 60 to 1 at 1 a.m. It would allow OCTA to collect tolls on the
express lanes and nullify a contractual ban on improvements to the
Riverside Freeway, a key step in long-range plans to ease congestion
on one of Southern California's most gridlocked roads.</LD>
<LD>   "We accomplished what a lot of people didn't think we could
accomplish," said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, chairman of
the OCTA board. "The governor, with one stroke of his pen, can now
take credit for significant congestion relief for 250,000 daily
motorists."</LD>
<TE>   But supporters of the legislation aren't taking Davis' approval
for granted. "Once you begin thinking anything up here is a slam
dunk, you're in trouble," said the bill's author, Assemblyman Lou
Correa (D-Anaheim).</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been noncommittal. And like many Democrats in
Sacramento, he is philosophically opposed to toll roads. "As long as
I'm governor, freeways are staying free," he said in March.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Davis echoed that line Saturday. "He's going to
have to read that bill carefully," said press aide Hilary McLean.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis signs the bill, OCTA could take possession of the express
lanes, which stretch for 10 miles between Anaheim and the Riverside
County line, as early as Jan. 2, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to focus on the positives," the supervisor said. "We have
bipartisan support, bi-county support and statewide support for this
action. The Democrats supported it. If the governor didn't want this
on his desk, he could have killed it in committee."</TE>
<TE>   Three Assembly members from Orange County--Correa, Bill Campbell
and Tom Harman--voted for AB 1010. But three did not vote: John
Campbell, Ken Maddox and Patricia Bates.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people still had questions about the appraisal" for the
sale, Correa said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people still had questions about the commitment for future
construction and improvements on the road. There were a lot of
legislators who had differences of opinion over tweaks to the
legislation. But even they recognized the common goal, which is to
ease traffic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA has offered $207.5 million for the lanes, which were built in
the mid-1990s for about $135 million and are owned by California
Private Transportation Co. The sale would allow OCTA to negate a
non-compete agreement the company has with the California Department
of Transportation that prevents widening of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Each workday, about 250,000 cars squeeze through the artery that
connects Orange County and the Inland Empire--a number expected to
hit 400,000 by 2010.</TE>

<SE>Man Pleads Not Guilty in Rape, Robbery Case</SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pasadena man accused of kidnapping a woman from her east Ventura
home and sexually assaulting her has pleaded not guilty to criminal
charges.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Fields, 27, was arrested in August in a Pasadena motel room
after police received tips based on a composite drawing of the
suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Police launched a search after a man slipped through an unlocked
sliding glass door into the home of a 52-year-old woman on June 27
and ordered her into her car. The man sexually assaulted the woman in
Oxnard, then forced her to withdraw cash from an ATM before driving

<LD>Both the state Senate and Assembly have passed a measure that would
allow Ventura and Santa Barbara counties to double fines for traffic
violations in school zones.</LD>
<LD>   The School Zone Pedestrian Safety Bill, written by Assemblywoman
Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), now awaits consideration by
the governor, who has a month to decide whether to sign it.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson's bill would create a six-year pilot program that would
allow the counties to voluntarily opt to participate. Officials in
both Ventura and Santa Barbara counties support the measure, Jackson
has said.</LD>
<TE>   The idea behind the program is to lessen the number of children
injured or killed by traffic violators. The measure passed the Senate
by a vote of 27 to 8 and the Assembly 67 to 9.</TE>

<DH>How terrorists hatched a simple plan to use planes as bombs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY McDERMOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, a cadre of freelance terrorists planned an improbable
day of horror in which they would blow up a dozen U.S. airliners,
killing, if the men were lucky and good, several thousand people.</LD>
<LD>   This plan was foiled and most of the men caught, but one key
figure escaped, and the idea went with him. He was something of a
ghost, eluding investigators for years, just beyond vision and reach,
forever a step ahead. He fled to Afghanistan, where he became a key
Al Qaeda agent.</LD>
<LD>   He brought with him the idea of using airplanes as weapons. The
leaders of Al Qaeda liked the idea and made it their own.</LD>
<TE>   A small group of men spread across the globe was assigned
the task, and last September they killed more than 3,000 people in New
York and Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. In the first weeks
following the attacks, authorities loudly and frequently blamed Osama
bin Laden and his organization, Al Qaeda. Since then, however,
authorities have been reluctant to say much of anything about the
details, in large part because they do not know them.</TE>
<TE>   Enough is known, however, to describe how the plan to fly
airplanes into buildings came into being, how it was elaborated upon
and how it succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   The story begins in Manila, Christmastime, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   For most of a month, the men with the chemical burns and the
misshapen fingers carted boxes and bottles through the terrazzo lobby
of the Josefa, up six flights and down the hall to the shut door of
Apartment 603, a furnished studio with kitchenette, dark parquet
floors, off-white walls and a shuttered window overlooking President
Quirino Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   It was the window that worried the cops.</TE>
<TE>   In normal years, Christmas in Manila is a prolonged celebration.
That December, though, arrived in a meaner season. A typhoon had
barreled through mid-month, ripping out trees and power lines and,
for the authorities, sharpening the edge on an already anxious time.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II had announced a five-day January visit.
There were substantial fears within the country's intelligence community
that increasingly violent Islamic activists would try to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   The national police had just completed a 182-page catalog of
terrorist activity throughout the island nation. It had been a
horrible year: More than 50 incidents and 101 deaths, with Roman
Catholic priests among the frequent targets. The terrorists were
based on the southern island of Mindanao, but bombs had already
exploded in Manila on Metro trains, at a Wendy's hamburger stand and
a local movie theater. Another had blown a hole in an airliner.</TE>
<TE>   The pope was a complication the cops didn't need. They increased
surveillance and put local officials on high alert. That's where the
window on the sixth floor of the Josefa came in. The apartment is but
a quarter-mile from the Vatican ambassador's residence, where the
pope would stay. The window looks directly down onto a busy street
that the papal entourage would use.</TE>
<TE>   The story has been told for years that on the night of Jan. 6, a
week before the pope's arrival, the men in 603 accidentally started a
fire in the kitchenette, and fled as it set off alarms. Firefighters
and police rushed to the scene. They discovered the fire had subsided
without assistance and prepared to call it a night until one
suspicious police officer insisted on taking a look in the room.
Inside, she found the place littered with beakers, funnels, cotton
batting, cans of gasoline and a pair of king-size Welch's grape juice
bottles filled with what turned out to be liquid nitroglycerin.</TE>
<TE>   The truth about that night and the fire, officials say now, is a
bit more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Manila is a sprawling mess of a metropolis, divided into districts
called baranguays. Local politics operate like a turn-of-the-century
American patronage machine: Each baranguay has a chief who delivers
neighborhood complaints up the line and municipal favors down it.
They keep their eyes open.</TE>
<TE>   The Josefa is in the Malate baranguay. Apolinario Medenilla was
the machine's man in Malate. He came around to have a look.</TE>
<TE>   The Josefa is a drab, water-stained stucco, half-hotel,
half-apartment house, with groaning air conditioners and a transient
clientele. It rents rooms by the day, week or month. Next to it is a
ragtag slum of tin-can squatter shacks, dusty pawnshops and two-stool
cafes. Manila Bay is half a mile west, and cargo ship crewing
agencies have offices in the slum, making it a place of constant
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The men in 603 had rented the room for a month and were
so secretive they wouldn't let the maid in to change the sheets. It
wasn't that they seemed averse to women, as some Muslim visitors
were. They paid considerable attention to the city's salacious
nightlife, coming and going at all hours, not always unaccompanied.
And then there was the puzzle of all those boxes carted through the
lobby. Manila is a tropical city, a steam room. Labor is cheap and
people don't exert themselves if it can be avoided. Hauling heavy
cartons is not typical tourist behavior. Medenilla passed the
information on to police, who shared his suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials now say police, worried about the pope's
imminent arrival, started the fire that set off the alarm at the
Josefa. When it sounded, the occupants ran out, the cops walked in
and looked around. They then left and hunted down a search warrant.
Even at that, according to police records, they had to ask 11 judges
before they found one who would sign it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the method of discovery, the police hit an intelligence
gold mine.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence filled three police vans. There were priests' robes
and collars, Bibles, crucifixes and maps of the pope's prospective
travels; chemistry textbooks and chemicals--acids and nitrates by the
gallon, one finished pipe bomb and another waiting to be packed;
there were a dozen passports and as many Casio watches, apparently to
be used as timers; soldering irons, switches and loops of electrical
wire.</TE>
<TE>   The men in 603 were professional terrorists. They had stocked a
bomb factory and left behind evidence they intended to use it.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, a Pakistani named Ramzi Yousef, was among the most
wanted men on Earth--the key suspect in the 1993 truck bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York. They had come to Manila with enough
new plans to make New York seem like a warm-up act. The plans were
left behind on a Toshiba laptop. They included a plot to assassinate
the pope and another audacious scheme to board a dozen American jumbo
jets, place homemade bombs aboard them and blow them up over the
Pacific. Yet another plan on the computer called for the terrorists
to dive-bomb an airplane into CIA headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Through a combination of luck and international cooperation, the
two men in 603 and an accomplice were captured within a year.
Interrogations revealed there were still more plans and more men, men
who have yet to be found. An investigator described the cell as part
of "a strong network, continuously hatching plots." One of the
unfound men, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, was a particular mystery. Nobody
was quite certain who he was. Even his name was suspect. There are
now more than a dozen aliases attributed to him.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out he had been living in Manila for most of a year. He
told people he was a Saudi businessman. He stayed in a fancy
apartment in a nicer part of town, across the street from the
country's future president. He drove his own car. He took diving
lessons. He patronized go-go bars and karaoke clubs and held meetings
at plush hotels. He tipped well. He was flashy--once renting a
helicopter just to impress a girlfriend by hovering over her office,
calling on his cell phone and telling her to wave.</TE>
<TE>   Still, police had little idea what his connection to the bombers
might be.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11 and one of the most intensive police and
intelligence investigations in history. In the course of it,
apparitions of Mohammed kept emerging from the mists of information.
By this summer, American investigators had concluded Mohammed was a
principal planner of the September attacks. The idea to kill
thousands of Americans last fall by turning airliners into bombs
might well have been his.</TE>
<TE>   Filipino investigators came to a similar conclusion. The idea to
kill thousands of Americans by blowing up airplanes in 1995 was
probably Mohammed's as well, and Sept. 11 its fulfillment.</TE>
<TE>   Much had happened between the two plots. What the investigator had
said about the Manila cell could easily be applied to all of Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda in the intervening years: Foremost, it was a
network continuously hatching plots.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Al Qaeda's circumstances, successes or lack thereof, one
thing that never changed was that the plots just kept coming: ships
in Yemen, embassies in Africa, an airport in Los Angeles, a cathedral
in France, a subway in Singapore. As the plots multiplied, Khalid
Mohammed kept reappearing.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, many of the plots seemed ill-conceived ideas
pursued by ill-equipped or unprepared men. Ramzi Yousef, convicted of
the first attack on the World Trade Center and the plot to blow up
airliners, complained to investigators that if he'd had enough money,
he'd have toppled the trade center towers back in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   It took time, but by the autumn of 2001, money was no longer a
problem. Khalid Mohammed and his cohorts eliminated that and every
other obstacle. Rather than rely on casual collections of hapless men
patching together whatever foolhardy scheme they lit upon, they drew
new men from three continents into their plot--diverse men, including
an architect, an aerospace engineer, a patent medicine salesman, a
computer programmer, sons of the Saudi middle class and an itinerant
Yemeni who lived for two years in a cramped government barracks so
uninviting authorities called it a container.</TE>
<TE>   The organization was patient. While the men from around the globe
were assembled and prepared, it went on doing what it otherwise
did--churning out ideas for new and imaginative ways to kill.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they were done, the old idea, the one with the
airplanes, turned out to be the best--or worst--of them all.</TE>
<TE>   Fighters Without a War</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda was born in the course of a 10-year resistance to the
Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. The war against the
Soviets became a worldwide rallying cry of radical Islam and, more, a
forum for action. Tens of thousands of young men from throughout
Islam answered the call to arms. The war's end presented a
predicament: What would these so-called Afghan Arabs do now?</TE>
<TE>   Fundamentalist Islam is viewed as a threat in much of the Muslim
world. Many moujahedeen came home to inhospitable regimes. One of
them later described the group as lost, without purpose "except to
carry out the jihad."</TE>
<TE>   One such man and his wife arrived at a compound of migrant
quarters in tiny Kampung Sungai Manggis, south of Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, in early April 1991. He was short, stout, bearded and
wearing a skullcap; she, even shorter, and completely covered in dark
dress and full veil. The couple were strangers to Mior Mohamad
Yuhana, the man who owned the migrant shacks, but they came
recommended by a local man, and Mior thought they looked kindly.</TE>
<TE>   The visitor said his name was Hambali, he was Indonesian and was
moving to Malaysia so that he might practice Islam more freely. Mior
told him he didn't care about that. Stay out of trouble, pay the rent
and we'll be fine, he said. He led them to a tiny wooden shack, about
the size of a one-car garage, with weathered siding, bare concrete
floors and a single lightbulb inside.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali grew up in the volcanic highlands of west Java and
attended an Islamic boarding school and university. He answered the
call to jihad and spent three years fighting in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali and his wife arrived in Sungai Manggis with the clothes
they wore and a single bag each.</TE>
<TE>   "They cooked and ate, slept on the floor," Mior said.</TE>
<TE>   Sungai Manggis is just minutes from the western Malaysian coast,
and from there an hour by boat across the Strait of Malacca to
Indonesia. It is a well-traveled path for poor Indonesians, who come
for work. But Sungai Manggis is not a place to get rich.</TE>
<TE>   The area is blanketed with overgrown rubber plantations, abandoned
when the fickle world market moved on. The landscape is green and
tangled, the earth a deep orange clay that clings as dust in the
morning and mud after the heavy midday rains. The hills are empty as
yet of the Western-style subdivisions of the capital, but the
bulldozers are coming. The area is being pulled into the sprawling
compass of Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   Roadside stands are piled high with mangoes, pineapple, durian
and--an indication of the oncoming march of the suburbs--sacks of
used golf balls.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali did odd jobs and soon began showing up outside the
gold-domed mosque on the southern edge of the nearby market town of
Banting, selling kebabs out of a tri-shaw cart. His wife, joined by
her mother, was seldom seen beyond the rented shack.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali switched from kebabs to patent medicines and began
traveling, on business, he said, disappearing for weeks at a time. At
home, he received what became a steady stream of visitors, Mior said.
They spoke English and Arabic and sometimes carried Duty Free
shopping bags. The men were "in their late 20s or early 30s. They
looked tough. I remembered thinking at that time they would make good
footballers," Mior said.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali prospered. Soon, he was driving a red Proton hatchback and
juggling calls on a pair of cell phones. Many of those calls,
investigators later determined, were made to a man who had recently
arrived in Manila, Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the Jihad</TE>
<TE>   When the Soviets left Afghanistan, the country descended into
gruesome civil war. With shifting alliances of tribes, warlords and
religious sects, a network of camps, schools and supply routes that
Bin Laden had helped establish along the Pakistani border was busier
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Ramzi Yousef was one of the moujahedeen who returned to the
region. Yousef was born and raised in Kuwait, where his parents were
among thousands of Pakistanis drawn to the oil-rich kingdom. Yousef
had first come to the camps on a break from college in Wales in 1988.
He returned in 1991, after receiving an associate degree in
electrical engineering. He later told investigators he spent six
months training in the camps. He was so adept at bomb-making that he
was known to trainees as "the chemist."</TE>
<TE>   After his training, Yousef began recruiting the motley crew with
which he would attack the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef later told investigators his principal goal was the
liberation of Palestine, a political rather than religious motive. A
boyhood friend, Abdul Hakim Murad, said that what Yousef really
wanted to do was kill a lot of Jews. He didn't care how or where.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef arrived in New York in the fall of 1992 wearing a
three-colored silk suit and carrying an Iraqi passport with no entry
visa. He claimed to be seeking political asylum. He was given two
options--arrest or deportation. He chose arrest and was then
immediately released on his own recognizance because, an INS agent
later testified, "There was a lack of detention space."</TE>
<TE>   Yousef moved into a Jersey City, N.J., apartment and started
scouting targets. He spent time driving around Brooklyn because he
had been told Jews lived there. Murad, according to transcripts of
police interrogations, had earlier suggested to Yousef that many Jews
worked at the World Trade Center and that maybe he should consider
the site as a target.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, a bomb Yousef built for $3,000 blew up in the
basement of the trade center's north tower, killing six, injuring
about 1,000 and causing $300 million in damage. It was less than
Yousef intended. He wanted the bomb to topple the north tower onto
the south and release a cyanide cloud into the complex's ventilation
system.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborators were arrested and Yousef's role discovered. An
international manhunt followed, with a reward of $2 million for his
capture. Yousef disappeared for a time into the lawless western
Pakistani province of Baluchistan, where he had relatives. He soon
reemerged as a man about town in Peshawar and Karachi, a kind of folk
hero much sought after among people who wanted to blow things up.</TE>
<TE>   His boyhood friend Murad was living in Karachi. He had recently
returned from the U.S., where he had earned a commercial pilot's
license. Yousef came to see him. He talked, Murad said, about the
need for good Muslims to give their lives, if needed, to the
struggle. They talked about potential targets: Benazir Bhutto, then
the prime minister of Pakistan; nuclear power stations; a government
official in Iran; the U.S. Consulate there in Karachi and a variety
of other U.S. government buildings. There was a plan to assassinate
President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask anybody," Murad said later, "even if you ask children,
they will tell you that the U.S. is supporting Israel and Israel is
killing our Muslim brothers in Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   Murad proposed packing an airplane full of explosives and
dive-bombing into the Pentagon or CIA headquarters. Yousef said it
was worth considering.</TE>
<TE>   He took Murad to meet a man interested in such things. He said his
name was Abdul Magid. He was a Saudi import-export businessman, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   His real name, police later determined, was Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed. He wasn't Saudi, but like Yousef a Baluchi, born and raised
by expatriates in Kuwait. He is thought to be Yousef's uncle.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign workers flooded the Gulf states in the 1970s and '80s. The
oil economy couldn't have functioned without them, but they were not
encouraged to think of it as home. In Kuwait, they are referred to as
bidoon, translated as "without," as in without citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Like Yousef, Mohammed had gone abroad to study engineering. He
enrolled at a two-year college in North Carolina in 1984. After
college, he came home to Pakistan and joined what appears to have
been the family business--jihad. A Kuwaiti newspaper has reported
that he went to work as secretary to an Afghan warlord. It is likely
his older brother Zayed arranged the job.</TE>
<TE>   Zayed was a Pakistani representative of Mercy International, a
Saudi-funded relief organization. The Kuwaiti government this summer
said Zayed was a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Murad said his first meeting with Magid/Mohammed was at Mohammed's
Karachi apartment. He said Mohammed was very interested in learning
everything he could about pilot training: how long it took, how
expensive it was and who could qualify for it.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef took Murad to see Mohammed a second time. Again, Murad
said, Mohammed talked almost exclusively about flying.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Yousef had persuaded Murad to join the cause. The two of
them moved to an open-air compound where Yousef taught Murad to build
bombs. Making chocolate, Yousef called it. In one practice session, a
detonator exploded in Yousef's face. Yousef lost partial sight in one
eye, Murad said.</TE>
<TE>   As Yousef recuperated, Mohammed showed up out of nowhere, Murad
said, to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Eluding Capture</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Mohammed, Yousef and a third plotter, Wali Shah Khan,
arrived in the Philippines in early 1994. Khan had stopped en route
in Kuala Lumpur, where he and Hambali, the Indonesia patent medicine
salesman, incorporated an export company called Konsojaya. Its real
purpose, police say now, was to serve as a financial conduit for the
plotters.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, the trio acted like anything but Islamic terrorists.
All had local girlfriends. They hung out at karaoke bars and strip
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef and Mohammed, just weeks before they intended to blow up
the pope, went on holiday to a coastal resort, where they took
scuba-diving lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef's friend Murad joined them just before Christmas. The plans
for the airplane plot--which they code-named Bojinka, Serbo-Croatian
for explosion--called for men to board flights in Asia that had
intermediate stops before heading across the Pacific. They would
plant Yousef's bombs on the planes, disembark at the intermediate
stop and do the same thing on another flight. The bombs' timers would
be set so that all the bombs would go off more or less
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef did a trial run Dec. 9, planting a small version of his
bomb on a Philippine Airlines flight to Tokyo. It exploded, killing
one man. It would have caused the plane to crash if not for what were
described as heroic efforts by the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   That was the end of it, though. Police intelligence and fears for
the pope's safety led to the fire alarm and discovery of the bomb
factory.</TE>
<TE>   Murad was caught that night when Yousef sent him back to the
apartment to get Yousef's Toshiba laptop. Yousef walked off into the
night. He made his way via Thailand to Pakistan. He was betrayed
there by a man he tried to recruit and captured in a raid by U.S.
agents and Pakistani security forces at a small hotel in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   When Khan was arrested seven months later, just one of the known
Manila plotters remained at large--Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities think now he stayed for some days, perhaps weeks, in
Manila, then made his way to Doha, Qatar, where he apparently enjoyed
the patronage of a high-ranking member of the government.</TE>
<TE>   One of Mohammed's brothers had attended university in Doha in the
1980s and became a much respected teacher. He reformed a network of
social clubs that had previously been disreputable and made them a
key feature in Doha's social and religious life. Many people there
still speak fondly of the brother, and this apparently helped
Mohammed settle quickly into Qatar society.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was a kind of happy networker, said Khaled Mahmoud, an
acquaintance.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew your name the second time you met him and remembered
things about you from previous conversations," Mahmoud said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud recalls running into Mohammed at the mosque. They chatted
for perhaps 30 minutes, during which they were repeatedly interrupted
by people coming up to say hello to the short, slightly plump,
slightly balding young Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed is said to have been funny and charming, an image that
fits with the evidence of him as Manila raconteur. His very public
lifestyle caught up with him in 1996. U.S. investigators identified
him as their Manila suspect, and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh sent a
letter to the Qatar government asking for permission to send a team
after Mohammed. The government agreed and the team moved in,
according to Robert Baer, a retired CIA officer. Baer said his
account of the attempted capture was given to him later by the head
of Qatar's national police, who told him he was ordered by a member
of the Qatar ruling family to provide Mohammed and four other men
with blank passports. The police chief said the other men included
top Bin Laden aides Ayman Zawahiri and Mohammed Atif.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the FBI team arrived, Mohammed and the others were
gone.</TE>
<TE>   American officials decline to speak about the escape, except to
say that cooperation between Qatar and the U.S. is excellent now.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials think Mohammed moved to Afghanistan, where he went
to work for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   In discussions of terrorism at the time, Bin Laden's name was
mentioned in passing, if at all. That was about to change.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1995, a National Guard post in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, had
been bombed, and five Americans were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had begun to suspect that Bin Laden was training and
dispatching terrorists from his base in Sudan. When they pressured
the Sudanese to expel him, there were not many places he could go. Of
these, Afghanistan was the most likely.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1996, Bin Laden and an entourage of 150 men, women and
children arrived by C-130 transport plane in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a fuel truck exploded at a U.S. Marine barracks in
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden did not claim responsibility for the attacks, but he
conspicuously praised them.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Bin Laden issued from his new home in the Afghan
mountains a declaration of war against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban leaders welcomed Bin Laden. He repaid the favor by
furnishing them fighters and money. The moujahedeen training camps
were rejuvenated by Bin Laden's presence.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Bin Laden issued a second declaration of war against the
U.S. and announced a merger of his Al Qaeda with organizations from
Pakistan, Egypt and across Africa. The merger brought experienced
fighters and strategists under Bin Laden's banner.</TE>
<TE>   The new organization declared: "To kill Americans and
their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every
Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible."</TE>
<TE>   It was a call for a new generation of jihadists.</TE>
<TE>   A Place of Comfort and Hate</TE>
<TE>   On a typically gray, damp day in Hamburg, when steel-hard winds
blow down from the Baltic and the city grows dark and the evening
cool turns cold, the thing that is noticed first when men come out of
the weather into Al Quds mosque is the warmth they bring with them. A
hand is clasped; bearded cheeks brush one against another; shoulders
are squeezed; smiles, soft words and quiet laughter are shared.</TE>
<TE>   Al Quds occupies a warren of sparsely decorated rooms upstairs
from a downscale gym. It sits in a poorer quarter of Germany's
richest city, on a hard, seamy street just east of Hauptbahnhof, the
city's main rail station. The location, amid but removed from the
drug dealers and hookers on Steindamm Street below, is perfect: Rent
is cheap and the train station makes Al Quds accessible from all
points on the Hamburg map.</TE>
<TE>   The men come to evening prayer from across the city and from
across the Arab world. Hamburg has a sizable Muslim population, about
5% of its almost 2 million people, and mosques are spread throughout
the city to serve them. The overwhelming majority are Turks, but Al
Quds is not a Turkish mosque.</TE>
<TE>   There is within Islam, as they say, only one God and God is great,
but any religion that requires its faithful to pray five times a day
can expect them to exercise some discretion in determining where and
with whom those prayers are said. Mosques, like churches in
Christendom, segregate themselves by ethnicity, economics and
scriptural interpretation. The version presented at Al Quds is Arab,
dispossessed and harsh, which fit exactly the world view of certain
Muslims in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jews and Crusaders must have their throats slit," is the way
one Al Quds preacher put it. This was for most of the decade not an
unusual formulation.</TE>
<TE>   A match had been struck in Afghanistan, and Islam was aflame. Al
Quds was distinctive in Hamburg but no different from thousands of
other mosques around the world--from San Diego to Jakarta to
London--where a new radical Islam was nursed to a fire, and the fire
fed.</TE>
<TE>   There are two smaller, mostly Arab mosques very near Al Quds, and
members of what later came to be called the Hamburg terrorist cell
sometimes worshiped at those as well. But investigators think it was
within Al Quds' plain rooms that a group of like-minded young men
found one another and, for many of them, a calling.</TE>
<TE>   The group was small--investigators think fewer than 20 people. It
produced three of the Sept. 11 pilots--Mohamed Atta, Marwan Al-Shehhi
and Ziad Samir Jarrah. Two other men apparently wanted to join
them--Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Zakariya Essabar, both of whom were
denied U.S. visas. When the pilots left for the United States, Bin
al-Shibh became the key contact--and a conduit for money--back in
Germany. Essabar, Bin al-Shibh and a roommate of Atta, Said Bahaji,
all fled Germany before the attacks and remain fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   The men of the Hamburg cell came from different backgrounds and
countries but in ways were strikingly similar. Many were physically
slight, men the size of boys; most were from the fringes of whatever
society they came from and whatever schools they attended. All but
one enrolled in college and many did not fit well into German life.
Several had never before expressed much interest in religion or
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The men came to Germany at different times and to different cities
over five years, beginning in the summer of 1992 when Atta, then 24,
arrived from Egypt. He eventually enrolled at the Technical
University of Hamburg-Harburg, studying urban planning.</TE>
<TE>   Atta lived as a strict Muslim from the time of his arrival in
Hamburg. He fasted during Ramadan and observed dietary prohibitions
carefully. He prayed five times a day. He visited mosques when his
schedule permitted; otherwise, he prayed wherever he was--at home,
school or work.</TE>
<TE>   During his first years in Hamburg, Atta gave no sign of being
anything other than an exceptionally disciplined student. He went to
class, did his work and prayed. A roommate took him to a movie once.
Atta hated it and they never went again. He made few friends. He
generally ate alone and, his roommates said, not with any joy.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember," a roommate said, "sitting down at the table and
Mohamed sighing, 'This is boring. Eating is boring.' He said it
wasn't just that he wanted different food, it was just the act of
eating."</TE>
<TE>   He was an oddly self-contained man, the roommate said, "reluctant
to any pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   It is not certain when Atta started going to Al Quds, but a friend
recalls meeting him there soon after the mosque opened in 1993. He
went to mosque daily and sometimes returned to his room in the
evening with Arab friends.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign undergraduates must demonstrate German language competence
before being admitted to university. When the other members of the
cell began to arrive in Germany in 1994, they all enrolled in
language programs, most of them in smaller cities around Germany.</TE>
<TE>   When Said Bahaji came to Hamburg at the beginning of 1995, it was
a homecoming of sorts. His Moroccan father and German mother met and
married in Germany, and Bahaji was born there in 1975. The family
moved to Morocco when he was 9. He came back for college.</TE>
<TE>   He enrolled in the electrical engineering program at the technical
university in 1996. He lived at a student home and spent weekends
with his aunt Barbara Arens, a graphic designer with whom Bahaji
shared an affinity for computers. He called her his "high-tech aunt."
He had been secular, she said, until introduced to radical Islam by
fellow students. Arens eventually kicked him out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Ramzi bin al-Shibh came to Germany not as a student, but,
using the name Ramzi Omar, by claiming to be a political refugee from
Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly when he arrived in the country. He made an
asylum claim in 1995, which was denied; he appealed and was assigned
to what the Germans call a container camp north of Hamburg. The camp
in the little town of Kummerfeld is a single building about the size
and shape of a ship container. The container is divided into three
sleeping rooms, one bathroom and one kitchen. It's cramped, drafty
and unpleasant. Container residents were paid a modest monthly
stipend. They were encouraged but not required to find work.
Typically for Germany's modern bureaucracy, as long as they showed up
for weekly roll calls, they were free to come and go as they pleased.</TE>
<TE>   Bin al-Shibh's asylum appeal was eventually denied. The judge in
the case said he doubted Bin al-Shibh was even Sudanese, much less
fleeing persecution. The judge was right. Bin al-Shibh was born in
Yemen, in the mountain valley region of Hadramaut, the ancestral home
of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The dismissal of the claim had little effect. Bin al-Shibh had
already returned to Yemen, then, using his real name, he received a
German visa and reentered the country legally.</TE>
<TE>   Marwan al-Shehhi came from a small town north of Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates. His father was a Muslim cleric, and the son has
been described as an especially devout Muslim. He enrolled in a
language institute in Bonn in February 1996. He boarded with a local
family. He took language classes for more than two years before he
demonstrated sufficient competence to enroll in university.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't move permanently to Hamburg until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   This seems to some investigators quite late for someone who would
play such a key role in the plot. Al-Shehhi had spent several months
in 1998 in Hamburg, trying to pass his language exams. Presumably,
had he passed in Hamburg in 1998, he would have stayed. He didn't,
however, and had to move back to Bonn.</TE>
<TE>   Just after Al-Shehhi left, a Pakistani student named Atif bin
Mansour arrived in Hamburg. Early the next year, Mansour, whose name
has never been released by German authorities, was Atta's
co-applicant for a room for a new Islamic study group at the
technical university. Mansour was a pilot on leave from the Pakistani
Air Force. This in itself is intriguing--a Pakistani pilot?
Investigators acknowledge they haven't figured out Mansour's role in
the plot, if any. The German Federal Bureau of Criminal
Investigations said he remains "a very interesting figure."</TE>
<TE>   Mansour's brother, also in the Pakistani armed forces, was killed
in battle that spring of 1999. Mansour rushed home to be with his
family and never came back. Not long after, Al-Shehhi returned to
Hamburg. It is as if they replaced one another.</TE>
<TE>   Ziad Samir Jarrah came from a well-known and secular family in
Lebanon. He moved to Greifswald, in the former East Germany, in the
spring of 1996 to begin college. Almost immediately, Jarrah met a
medical student, a woman named Aysel Senguen, and within the year
they were living together and plotting their escape from Greifswald.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrah moved to Hamburg in 1997, enrolling in the aeronautical
engineering department at the University of Applied Sciences. The
summer after he started classes, he worked in the paint shop of the
Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg. He was there at the same time,
apparently on the same shift, as a young Moroccan student, Zakariya
Essabar, who, that fall, also moved to Hamburg and enrolled at
Applied Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Man</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard Falk, vice president of the German investigative agency,
said the recruiting of men to join the jihad seldom occurred in the
open. It was "in the backrooms, in closed circles. Only there, they
preach hate and anti-Western sermons, and say what they really think.
And there, the radicals try to convince certain people to go to
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   There were notable exceptions to this. One man everyone within Al
Quds knew was a big, beefy, bearded middle-aged fellow named Mohammed
Haydar Zammar. He was an auto mechanic who had been unemployed for
years. He, his wife and six children survived on welfare payments.</TE>
<TE>   Zammar's bluster matched his size. In almost any discussion,
his was the loudest voice and most radical view. He was well-known in
many of the city's mosques as an advocate of jihad; though he spoke
of serious things, he was not always regarded seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the neighboring Muhadjirin mosque said Zammar was
"like a little boy" who talked too much.</TE>
<TE>   Even Zammar's brother said, "His tongue was his problem."</TE>
<TE>   Zammar was familiar to authorities too, because of his
boisterousness and because he was apparently an acquaintance of a man
arrested as a suspected Al Qaeda agent in 1998, charged with
complicity in the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of Zammar's outspokenness, authorities tend to
discount his role in the Sept. 11 plot. They concluded no one would
entrust information to a braggart like him. It is clear, though, that
Zammar knew the men in the Hamburg cell, in particular Said Bahaji.
In part because of the acquaintance, German police in 1998 performed
what they describe as limited surveillance on Bahaji.</TE>
<TE>   Bahaji at the time was living with Atta and Bin al-Shibh. Nothing
came of the surveillance and it was discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany in the 1990s, the threat of terrorism of any sort
seemed distant. The last real threats had come from the political
left, in the Red Army Faction, successor to the 1970s Baader-Meinhof
gang. But that threat ended years before. The class struggle was
history.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing young Germans, Generation Golf, as they were
called, shared with the Maoists was an affinity for black
turtlenecks. Rather than rejecting the status quo, they wanted what
their parents had and worried they might not be able to get it.
Germany might have been the safest place in Europe to establish an Al
Qaeda cell.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of the seriousness with which Germany viewed the
threat of terrorism from within its fast-growing Muslim population is
the distribution of counter-terrorism resources. In Hamburg,
authorities had one man assigned part-time to monitor radical Islam.
That's half a man to watch 80,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities say they viewed men such as Zammar as
individuals, not connected to any formal networks.</TE>
<TE>   "We only knew them as radical Muslims. This is not a crime," one
investigator said. "They might have had contact with followers of
Osama bin Laden. This is also not a crime."</TE>
<TE>   There were, however, fundamentalist recruiting networks. In some
instances, these networks overlapped with--and took advantage of--a
missionary sect of Muslims called the Tabligh.</TE>
<TE>   The Tabligh proselytizes throughout the world. It professes to be
peaceful, but intelligence services throughout the Mideast say the
group was hijacked by organizations, such as Al Qaeda, to recruit
moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   Zammar was a Tabligh, according to his brother. He had traveled to
Pakistan at the group's invitation some years ago and joined, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Zammar no longer worked, religion became almost a full-time
job. To recruit people for jihad was not unusual, or illegal. For
more than a decade, thousands of men throughout Western Europe went
to Afghanistan, Bosnia or Chechnya to fight or, more usually, as a
sort of baptism to the broad goals of radical Islam. It became,
within that world, an almost hip thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   That was part of the ingenuity of the Sept. 11 plot. Much of it
could be put into place without crimes being committed. Those would
come later.</TE>
<TE>   The Soft Man</TE>
<TE>   German law enforcement officials think the recruitment of the
Hamburg cell probably didn't take place until 1998. The officials
claim, without describing it, to have one solid piece of evidence
from that period that indicates Atta played an unspecified lead role.</TE>
<TE>   These officials describe the most likely recruitment process as
being less formal than has generally been reported. They think there
might have been several steps in the process: first, a soft, mainly
religious recruitment, drawing the men into a deeper commitment to
their religion; second, an urging or outright invitation to go to
Afghanistan to see what it was like; third, at the camps, a harder
recruitment for those, perhaps few, deemed worthy of joining Al
Qaeda; and finally, a selection process for specific missions.</TE>
<TE>   They think Zammar would have contributed to the second stage,
acting as a sort of travel agent for people who wanted to go to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A principal candidate for the first-stage recruiter is a Hamburg
postal worker named Mohammed bin Nasser Belfas.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Indonesia and spent part of his childhood in Yemen.
He went to university in Cairo. Belfas came to Germany on a six-month
tourist visa in 1972. He stayed 13 years before he was discovered and
jailed. When he was released, the Germans tried to deport him. But
there was no place to deport him to. He was stateless. The Germans
relented and allowed him to stay. He was granted citizenship in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Belfas works the night shift at a suburban postal facility. He is
almost constantly in the company of young men. He is quite well-known
among Muslims. Friends say he is a lay missionary who has made it his
task--one called it a mission--to unite the various ethnicities and
sects of Muslims in Germany. He speaks German, Arabic, Indonesian and
English.</TE>
<TE>   He travels the country, paying particular attention to college
towns, where he will speak to any group no matter how small. He is,
in every sense, a recruiter, whether he knows it or not.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Belfas has conducted regular study meetings at
his apartment. Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi were regular members
of the study group. Atta, one attendee said, acted almost as Belfas'
deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Once, said Volker Harum Bruhn, a member of the group, they watched
a CNN newscast on suicide bombers in Israel. Part of the program told
the story of a bomber who set off his charge prematurely, injuring
only himself. He was rushed to an Israeli hospital unconscious. He
awoke on the operating table, looked up and said: "Is this heaven?"</TE>
<TE>   The doctor asked whether the bomber thought there were Jews in
heaven.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber replied, "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Then," the doctor said, "I guess you're not in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   This cracked everybody up, Bruhn said, even Atta, who didn't laugh
much.</TE>
<TE>   Joined Together</TE>
<TE>   Atta left Hamburg over the winter holiday, as he usually did, in
1997. This time, he didn't return for three months. He told his
roommate he had been on a pilgrimage to Mecca. He had been to Mecca
18 months earlier and it would be unlikely for a student--even one so
devout--to go twice so quickly or stay so long.</TE>
<TE>   It was the biggest gap in his schedule since he had come to
Hamburg and the first opportunity he would have had to go to camps in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   After he returned in the spring of 1998, almost everything
the core members of the group did, they did with others in the group.
That spring, Bin al-Shibh left the container camp and lived for a
time with Belfas. That summer, Atta, Bin al-Shibh, Al-Shehhi and
Belfas worked in a computer warehouse together, packing boxes.
Authorities say they don't know quite what to make of this. The man
who owns the company said he hired students when he had extra work.
It is normal summer work for students, but Belfas? Even the man who
owned the company thought it odd that a middle-aged night postal
worker would spend his days in a computer warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Atta left the student house at the end of summer. He and a
group of men--nobody knows how many--moved for a couple months into a
project flat on a cold stretch of road on an island in the Elbe
River. They had no furniture, only mattresses. Neighbors said they
were out of the house all day and they talked long into most nights.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter, Atta, Bin al-Shibh and Bahaji moved into a neat,
newly refurbished three-bedroom apartment at Marienstrasse 54, near
the university.</TE>
<TE>   Some investigators theorize the men in the Hamburg cell might have
been recruited by Al Qaeda scouts in the smaller German towns where
many lived, then sent to Hamburg. As possible evidence of this, they
cite the fact that several of the cities where the hijackers
lived--even small towns such as Greifswald and Muenster--had
well-known radical preachers.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest argument against the "sending theory" is that it
assumes there was some sort of control center in Hamburg, operating
for many years, and authorities have no evidence of this. German
officials, in fact, think the planning and control for Sept. 11
occurred almost entirely in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest explanation of the movement of the members of the
Hamburg cell is that it was completely natural. Most Arab
students--not just those who become terrorists--leave the smaller
college towns after they pass language tests and most of them head
for Berlin, Hamburg or Frankfurt. These are the largest cities in
Germany and the cities with the largest Islamic populations.</TE>
<TE>   However they arrived, by the end of 1998, all of the men in the
Hamburg cell except Al-Shehhi were in Hamburg and ready.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's Plan</TE>
<TE>   Given his taste for the high life and pretty girls, Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed can't have enjoyed Afghanistan much under the puritanical
Taliban. He seems to have gotten away often.</TE>
<TE>   European intelligence experts say in 1996 and '97 he spent time in
the Czech Republic capital of Prague, a key crossroads then for
questionable men and dirty money.</TE>
<TE>   American intelligence officials say he was in Germany in 1999. The
Americans speculate that Mohammed was there to meet with the Hamburg
cell.</TE>
<TE>   He is thought to have made repeated visits to Southeast
Asia--Malaysia and the Philippines. Once, in 1999, Philippine
intelligence officials say, the FBI tipped them Mohammed was back to
visit an old girlfriend. He vanished before agents arrived to arrest
him.</TE>
<TE>   American officials have told Italian authorities they suspect
Mohammed was in Rome for as long as three weeks in 2000. Others say
he played a central role that year in organizing the bombing of the
U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, this summer--even after Sept. 11--a report circulated in
Manila that Mohammed was back in town to see a girlfriend yet again.
Police found only a rumor and no man to back it up.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain when Mohammed first proposed the Sept. 11 airliner
attacks on the United States, but captured Al Qaeda officers have
told interrogators it was in fact Mohammed's idea, according to a
U.S. intelligence official. American officials think Mohammed brought
the airliner idea to the Al Qaeda hierarchy, which approved it and
gave Mohammed and perhaps another Bin Laden lieutenant, Abu Zubeida,
who ran the training camps, responsibility to manage it.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed wouldn't need bombs this time. The airplanes would become
the bombs. What he would need instead were pilots. Zubeida's camps
would be a good place to find them.</TE>
<TE>   This operation was different from previous Al Qaeda plots: It
was of a grander scale, more ambitious and expensive. It seems to have
been more closely controlled. The men seem to have been more
carefully chosen, more cosmopolitan and technically proficient.</TE>
<TE>   German investigators think the men were already committed to Al
Qaeda by the time of Mohammed's 1999 visit to Germany, although Atta
for one seemed to retain doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout 1999, Atta regularly attended Belfas' Islamic study
group. After one of these meetings, Atta asked to see Volker Harum
Bruhn privately. At that meeting, Bruhn said Atta warned him strongly
to stay away from Islamic extremists, to follow the Koran strictly
but to live a careful life.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the year, after Atta finally received his master's degree
in October, he went home to Cairo one last time. While there,
according to his aunt, he asked his mother, who was ill, whether he
could remain in Egypt permanently, to begin a career and care for
her.</TE>
<TE>   She insisted he continue his education, to go on to a doctoral
program in the United States. He did, of course, go to the United
States, but the next step in his education was in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the German federal police say they have uncovered
airline data that indicate Atta, Al-Shehhi and Jarrah--three Sept. 11
pilots--and Bin al-Shibh, who applied for flight school but was never
able to get a U.S. visa, all flew to Pakistan in November. They went
from there to an Al Qaeda training camp near Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Shehhi, who was paid a $2,000-per-month stipend from the United
Arab Emirates Army the entire time he was in Germany, withdrew $6,000
from his bank account to pay for the tickets. They flew separately,
with at least some of them using aliases through Istanbul to Karachi.
The timing of the meeting suggests this could have been when they
committed to the mission and were told it would involve learning to
fly airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Building a Terror Business</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Shaikh Mohammed wasn't the only one who got away after the
failed Manila bomb plot. Hambali, the Indonesian businessman, didn't
just elude capture; he eluded detection. Authorities didn't even know
he was involved.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in his little hut along Manggis River Village
Road and, security officials now say, began constructing a regional
network. Two other Indonesian fundamentalists lived in the village
for much of the same time Hambali did. Together, the three embarked
on a long, patient recruiting process. The other men preached
frequently at mosques. Hambali spoke only to small groups in private.</TE>
<TE>   One follower later told police what was most impressive about
Hambali was "his quiet and humble manners." He made a regular circuit
of small prayer groups; he raised money and insisted that jihad was
the answer. Malaysian police say they have since arrested several men
whom Hambali sent to Afghanistan for training; several bombing plots
have been attributed to his network.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, no one paid any attention.</TE>
<TE>   One of Hambali's disciples was Yazid Sufaat, a former Malaysian
army captain and Cal State Sacramento graduate. Sufaat and his wife,
also a Sacramento alumnus, had prospered after their return to Kuala
Lumpur. She owned a computer services firm; he did drug testing for
the government.</TE>
<TE>   They lived with their young children in a small row house in a
middle-class Kuala Lumpur suburb. It is not lavish; the house has the
decaying look of many things in the tropics, where time, heat and
humidity conquer all. But the couple were able to buy a weekend
getaway at a new condominium complex in the hills out of town. The
development advertises "city living, country style." With its Jack
Nicklaus-designed golf course, sports clubs, foot reflexology and
postpartum slimming classes, the development could be in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   One notable difference was that Sufaat frequently lent the condo
to Afghan war veterans who came to town to get artificial limbs. It
probably didn't seem all that unusual then, in early January 2000,
when a small group of Arabs, one missing a leg, showed up at the
condominium.</TE>
<TE>   The one-legged man was Tawfiq bin Atash, for many years a personal
aide to Osama bin Laden. With him were two men who would become Sept.
11 hijackers: Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi. At least two other
men attended, one of whom has been identified, tentatively, as Ramzi
bin al-Shibh from Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   The men were followed at the request of the CIA. The Americans had
intercepted a telephone call to Yemen in which Almihdhar detailed
arrangements for the trip. The Americans didn't know Almihdhar, but
they knew the number he called was used as a dispatch center for Al
Qaeda. Bin Laden had called it dozens of times over a period of years
in the late 1990s, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA asked the Malaysians to monitor the Kuala Lumpur meeting.
The Malaysians photographed the men going in and out of the condo.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until much later that CIA analysts figured out who the
men in the photos were. Atash was determined to have been one of the
coordinators of the October 2000 attack in Yemen on the destroyer
Cole. Yemeni authorities say Almihdhar also helped prepare the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Bin al-Shibh has not been positively identified from the
photographs. German police, however, say they have credit card
receipts that indicate Bin al-Shibh was in Malaysia at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat, who has been arrested, told Malaysian officials he allowed
the condo to be used at Hambali's request and had no idea who the men
were. He said he does not know whether Hambali attended the meeting
but said Hambali has his own key to the condo.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators do not know who else the men might have met while in
Kuala Lumpur. They do know that Malaysia was a frequent haunt of one
of Hambali's old business partners, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. It would
have made sense for him to be there, but no one knows whether he was.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting occurred in early January 2000, just after a series of
planned Al Qaeda millennium attacks failed. Intelligence officials
believe the men met to discuss new attacks: the Cole and, given the
timing, Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 8, the men left Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 15, Almihdhar and Alhazmi arrived in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 18, in the United Arab Emirates, Marwan Al-Shehhi, using a
brand-new passport, became the first of the Hamburg cell to apply for
and receive a U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Mohamed Atta began e-mailing 31 flight schools in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Atta, also using a new passport, received his U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of June, Al-Shehhi, Atta and Jarrah were all in the
United States, looking for flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;R in San Diego</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear when Omar Al-Bayoumi arrived in San Diego, who he
was, whom he worked for, why he came or why he left. What is clear is
that he had more to do with two men who later ended up aboard
American Airlines Flight 77 on Sept. 11 than anyone else in town.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Bayoumi appears to have arrived in San Diego in 1995. He lived
with his wife and four children at a suburban apartment complex. He
told people he was a student of international business, but it seemed
unlikely because he was already 40 years old and he never went to
school. He didn't work, either. He explained that by telling some
people he received a monthly stipend from his former employer, an
aviation company in his native Saudi Arabia, and telling others he
had a Saudi government scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Bayoumi almost always carried a video camera and taped
everything. He spent a lot of time at the Islamic Center of San
Diego, which is the hub of the city's multiethnic Muslim population.
He paid particular attention to newcomers and could be counted on to
help them find housing and get settled.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1999, he brought to town two young Saudi students and
asked people to help them settle in. They hardly spoke English and
would need help getting Social Security cards, driver's licenses and
bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The two men Al-Bayoumi brought to San Diego were Almihdhar and
Alhazmi.</TE>
<TE>   Alhazmi later told a friend he and Almihdhar met Al-Bayoumi at
a Los Angeles restaurant, when Al-Bayoumi overheard them speaking
Arabic and introduced himself. Al-Bayoumi learned they were new to
the area and offered to drive them to San Diego and help them get
settled.</TE>
<TE>   They took him up on the offer, Alhazmi said. Al-Bayoumi
brought them to the Parkwood Apartments, got them a room and even paid the
rent for the first couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   He threw them a welcome party. Al-Bayoumi told people they were in
San Diego to learn English, although, like him, no one can remember
either of them ever going to a single class. Alhazmi spent a lot of
time at the San Diego State library, surfing the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Alhazmi signed a six-month lease. And despite the fact that
Al-Bayoumi paid the first two months' rent, they complained that they
couldn't afford the place. They moved out, taking a room in the house
of a retired professor. In the spring, Alhazmi told a friend he was
having $5,000 wired to him from Saudi Arabia, but he had no account.
He asked whether the money could be sent to the friend's account. The
friend agreed, but when the money arrived it was from the United Arab
Emirates, not Saudi Arabia, and the sender was identified only as
Ali.</TE>
<TE>   The money was intended for flight lessons, which both Alhazmi and
Almihdhar said they wanted to take. Another friend took them to
Montgomery Field, north of San Diego, and arranged for them to start
lessons. They took one and quit.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day they came in here, they said they want to fly
Boeings," recalled Fereidoun "Fred" Sorbi, the instructor. "We said
you have to start slower. You can't just jump right into Boeings."</TE>
<TE>   Acquaintances said the pair seemed to regard their time in
California almost as R&amp;R. Alhazmi had season passes to Sea World and
the San Diego Zoo. They bought a Toyota sedan and liked to make the
run up to Las Vegas. In town, they hung out at Cheetah's, a nude bar
near the Islamic Center.</TE>
<TE>   The center itself is hardly a haven for radical Islam. It is
multiethnic and promotes assimilation. All the signs in the building
are in English. In 2000, a group of men showed up and passed out
literature praising Bin Laden. Center officials confiscated the
leaflets and told the men to leave and not come back.</TE>
<TE>   Almihdhar left San Diego in June 2000. Alhazmi stayed until
December. He took a job for a few weeks, washing cars at a Texaco
station. The station was owned by two Palestinians and was a hangout
for Arab men, who sat outside at a picnic table, talking and drinking
coffee. Alhazmi hung out with them even when he wasn't working. He
talked often, friends said, about Muslims being treated unfairly
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   He did not tell his San Diego friends that he had left Saudi
Arabia three years earlier to go to Chechnya to fight, which is what
his family says now.</TE>
<TE>   In December, another young Saudi arrived. Alhazmi introduced him
as Hani. The man was apparently Hani Hanjour, a Saudi who had spent
most of three years in Arizona in the late 1990s, training at various
flight schools. He was by every account a horrible flight student,
but eventually in 1999 managed to obtain a commercial license, after
which he returned to Saudi Arabia. Now back in the U.S., he and
Alhazmi went off to fly airplanes in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   On the Move</TE>
<TE>   The core of men involved in the Sept. 11 attacks did an enormous
amount of traveling. Much of 2000 and 2001 is a blur of movement.
They put thousands of miles on rental cars. They spent thousands of
dollars on plane tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Atta and Al-Shehhi each made at least two separate transatlantic
trips. Ziad Samir Jarrah arrived in the U.S. for flight training in
late June 2000. In the next 13 months, he left the country five
times.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 20, 2000, one of the odder trips occurred. Mohammed
Belfas, Atta's Hamburg mentor, accompanied Agus Budiman, a young
architecture student he had known for years, from Germany to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Belfas later said he simply wanted to see the United States. He
and Budiman flew to Washington, D.C. Budiman--like Belfas, an
Indonesian--had been coming to the United States for years. He had
family in the Washington suburbs, and even had a Virginia driver's
license, and now wanted to move permanently to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   While here, Belfas occasionally accompanied Budiman to his job as
a driver for Take-Out Taxi restaurant delivery service.</TE>
<TE>   Belfas offered to help drive the delivery car if Budiman would
help him get a U.S. driver's license. Budiman told Belfas he didn't
need an American license. Belfas insisted, saying he wanted the
license as a souvenir.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 4, Belfas and Budiman made the first of two trips to the
Department of Motor Vehicles office in downtown Arlington, Va. On the
first trip, Belfas received a Virginia identification card after he
and Budiman swore that Belfas lived in Arlington. When they went back
two days later, they got his driver's license, using the ID card as
proof of residence.</TE>
<TE>   That's all there was to it. Belfas had his souvenir, if that's
what it was. Within the week, he returned to Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2001, as they too neared the ends of their stay
in the U.S., seven of the 19 hijackers visited the same office to get
IDs or driver's licenses in exactly the same way. They didn't need
Budiman. They paid other men to sign on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   They used the IDs to make purchasing airline tickets and boarding
planes simpler.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis</TE>
<TE>   Of all the hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar is the one who seems to
have the broadest contacts with Al Qaeda. He appears to be the
son-in-law of a well-known Yemeni Al Qaeda figure and is believed to
have had a role in the Cole bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Almihdhar left the U.S. in the summer of 2000 and did not return
until July 4, 2001, by which time 12 other young Saudi men and one
from the United Arab Emirates had arrived at various locations on the
East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Less is known about these late-arriving men, in part because Saudi
Arabia has barred most reporters from the country. For months after
the attacks, the Saudi government denied even that the men were Saudi
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men were from the southwestern provinces of Saudi
Arabia. Most were from relatively well-off but not wealthy families.
Two-thirds of them told their families they were leaving to join the
jihad. Several mentioned wanting to fight in Chechnya. Several left
with friends or relatives.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known who recruited them for the Sept. 11 plot,
but those who went for training in the Afghan camps could easily have
been recruited there. Almihdhar's absence from the U.S. for the
entire time during which they were presumably recruited suggests he
might have played some role in recruiting them.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, it isn't surprising that so many Saudis
would be among the attackers: It is easier for Saudis to get American
visas.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, too, Saudis were the largest national group
among the Afghan Arabs. Bin Laden obviously is Saudi and so were many
of the financial backers of the moujahedeen and, later, the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The relief groups and charities that have been among the most
prominent supporters of the Taliban and have been implicated in
various Al Qaeda plots are either based in Saudi Arabia or derive
much of their support from there.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's brother ran one such agency.</TE>
<TE>   A Meeting on the Coast</TE>
<TE>   Two months before he made history, Atta made one last overseas
trip. On July 8, he flew from Miami to Madrid. The next day, Atta
rented a silver Hyundai and set off for Tarragona, an eight-hour
drive. It was his second trip to Spain that year. This time, he spent
11 days. For most of that time, Atta's former roommate Ramzi bin
al-Shibh was also in Spain, in the same region.</TE>
<TE>   Bin al-Shibh checked into the Hotel Monica in Cambrils. Atta
stayed in a hotel in Tarragona 15 minutes away.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Bin al-Shibh checked out without breakfast and
disappeared for five days. Atta too largely dropped off the screen.
Most investigators suspect the two came not to meet just one another,
but also with someone else--an operational commander such as Khalid
Shaikh Mohammed, or a courier relaying instructions. Perhaps, some
suspect, this was when the final details of the plot were set--the
date of the attack, maybe, or who would go on which airplanes. A
meeting could have taken place in a safe house provided by a local
network.</TE>
<TE>   This theory is consistent with the length of time they stayed and
with their disappearance for the bulk of it. But in Spain, as
elsewhere, despite months of investigation, the plotters left more
unknowns than answers.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory is the meeting concerned finding a replacement
pilot for Bin al-Shibh, who despite four applications was unable to
get a U.S. visa. The replacement, according to this theory, was
Zacarias Moussaoui, a muscular, angry French Moroccan veteran of the
Afghan camps and Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui is the only man charged by the United States with
involvement in the Sept. 11 plot. The logic of the U.S. indictment of
Moussaoui is that because Bin al-Shibh could not get into the United
States, the hijackers were one man short of the four teams of five
designated to commandeer the planes; Bin al-Shibh brought in
Moussaoui as a late replacement, prosecutors allege.</TE>
<TE>   On July 10, the day after Atta and Bin al-Shibh arrived in Spain,
Moussaoui paid the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Minnesota
for a flight simulator course, according to the indictment. He was
still in Norman, Okla., where he had washed out of a course earlier
in the year. He made another payment to the Minnesota school July 11.</TE>
<TE>   Bin al-Shibh returned to Hamburg on July 20. On July 29 and
Aug. 2, Moussaoui made several calls to a number in Dusseldorf, Germany.
Bin al-Shibh received wire payments totaling $15,000 from the
suspected 9/11 paymaster in United Arab Emirates on July 30 and 31 in
Hamburg, then wired $14,000 to Moussaoui on Aug. 1 and Aug. 3.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Moussaoui left Oklahoma for Minnesota, where he paid
approximately $6,300 in cash to the Pan Am International Flight
Academy on Aug. 10 and started his course. He quickly attracted
suspicion, resulting in his arrest on Aug. 17. Some investigators
suspect his arrest set the attacks in motion, perhaps prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   Final Flights</TE>
<TE>   Not long after Atta returned to the United States from Spain, he
made a quick trip to Las Vegas, his second of the summer. He stayed,
as usual, in a cheap motel off the Strip. At least two other
hijackers were in town at the same time--Alhazmi and Hanjour.</TE>
<TE>   Like much else about the plot, no one knows whether they met, or
if they did, why. Alhazmi and Hanjour by that point were living in
New Jersey. Atta had bought his Madrid air ticket the previous month
near the same New Jersey town where Hanjour and Alhazmi were living.
They could easily have met in New Jersey. Las Vegas wasn't
convenient. So why go there a month before the attacks?</TE>
<TE>   It could well be they were in Las Vegas to meet someone else, just
as in Spain. Las Vegas certainly seems like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's
kind of town.</TE>
<TE>   The next month, in effect, the last month, has been
well-documented. The Saudis were integrated with the Hamburg cell.
They moved in varying combinations up and down the East Coast. They
worked out at gyms and reserved and purchased air tickets.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, the remaining members of the Hamburg cell were making
preparations as well. Three months before Sept. 11, Said Bahaji told
his employers at the computer company he would be quitting his job in
the fall. He had accepted an internship in Pakistan, he told them,
and would be moving. His employers say he was an exceptional worker.
They were sorry to see him go.</TE>
<TE>   He told his family the same thing. His aunt Barbara Arens heard
about the internship, and she says now that she didn't believe a word
of it. She says she even went to the police before Sept. 11 to try to
get them to do something. Like what, they asked.</TE>
<TE>   Bahaji left Hamburg on Sept. 4, flew to Karachi via Istanbul and
disappeared. German agents later determined two other passengers on
the same flight stayed in the same room with Bahaji at the Embassy
Hotel in Karachi. They were traveling with false identification
papers. Zakariya Essabar disappeared from Hamburg at the same time.
Investigators think he might have been one of the men with Bahaji.
They don't know who the third man might have been.</TE>
<TE>   Ramzi bin al-Shibh returned to Spain on Sept. 5, flying from
Dusseldorf. He stayed at a private home in the Madrid area,
investigators say. He did not use his return ticket to Germany and is
presumed to have made his way to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, it was later determined, FBI agents were trying
unsuccessfully to get a look at Zacarias Moussaoui's computer. Other
agents were searching for Alhazmi and Almihdhar after having been
belatedly notified by the CIA that the two men were known to have
associated with terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   There was in the intelligence community a general air of concern,
verging on panic, that something very bad was about to happen. The
signs were there. The intelligence machine produced enormous amounts
of information and people were beginning to make sense of it.
Electronic intercepts, telephone chatter, warnings from foreign
services, internal memos--everything pointed in one direction. There
was something out there.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, the information makes the Sept. 11 attacks seem
inevitable. Unfortunately, retrospective analysis is useful in
understanding the past, not changing it, or even guaranteeing the
future will be different. For now, one thing has not changed
whatsoever:</TE>
<TE>   U.S. agents have been chasing the specter of Khalid
Shaikh Mohammed since 1994. They've come close to catching him at least
twice, but every time he managed to slip away, to stay a step ahead
of his pursuers.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, with the Afghan war fought and resolutely won, with
many key Al Qaeda operatives dead or captured, with the organization
flushed from its hide-outs, on the run and in some disarray, a truck
bomb exploded outside a synagogue in Tunisia, killing 19 people. Al
Qaeda?</TE>
<TE>   Before the attack, one of the bombers called a cell phone
belonging, it is thought, to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who some believe
has assumed a more central role in the organization and who, whatever
his role, remains, still, a step ahead.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry Into Madrid Cell Provides a View of Al Qaeda's Wide
Reach</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>In the labyrinthine world of Al Qaeda, it's not unusual to fly to
another country for a meeting or even to pick up an identity
document. Terrorists depend on a support infrastructure across the
globe.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Imad Eddin Barakat, a moon-faced Syrian
immigrant accused of playing a support role in the Sept. 11 plot,
commanded such a structure in Spain.</LD>
<LD>   A six-year police probe indicates the Madrid group stood out among
European cells because of unusually extensive ties to Al Qaeda
leaders and operations worldwide. The case has opened a window into
the workings of Al Qaeda--and possibly the preparations for the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Barakat, 38, came to Madrid in 1986. He married a Spaniard and
became a naturalized Spanish citizen, a pattern repeated by half a
dozen fellow suspects from his hometown of Aleppo. Barakat's group
has longtime connections to Syrian suspects in Germany who were close
to the Hamburg cell.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish suspects are shop owners, car salesmen, traders in
textiles and food products. They speak Spanish with the verve and
informality of natives and were readily accepted by middle-class
Spanish neighbors and co-workers. Although Barakat's wife converted
to Islam and wears traditional garb, the Spanish wife of another
suspect is a Catholic lawyer and works in a government ministry.</TE>
<TE>   During an interrogation by veteran investigative magistrate
Baltasar Garzon, Barakat described himself: "I work everything:
clothes, cars, honey, rugs, whatever turns up. I'm a free merchant; I
don't have one thing."</TE>
<TE>   Barakat, a father of five, was hefty, loud, always hustling. He
drove around in whatever new or used car he was peddling. He hawked
trunk loads of leather jackets and imitation Lacoste shirts outside a
gleaming Saudi-built mosque here.</TE>
<TE>   Barakat was arrested in November and remains in jail along with 14
others. Defense lawyers say the charges filed by Garzon, who is
renowned for prosecuting dictators and terrorists, are politically
motivated. Skeptics in Madrid's Arab community say the idea of
Barakat as a terrorist kingpin clashes with their memory of a
used-car salesman.</TE>
<TE>   "He moves in commerce, he has many contacts, he talks a lot," said
Riay Tatari Bakri, director of the Union of Muslim Communities of
Spain and an official at the Abu Bakr mosque where Barakat worshiped.
"In my judgment, a normal person."</TE>
<TE>   Barakat, whose conduct seems alternately streetwise and careless,
lived beyond his apparent means. He is part-owner of a now-shuttered
retirement home for senior citizens outside Madrid; curious neighbors
there said the place had a large Arab staff and not many old folks.
Barakat also helped bankroll construction projects. He lived in an
apartment on the top floor of a middle-class condo complex.</TE>
<TE>   His cell allegedly used real estate and construction companies and
Islamic charities to distribute an estimated $2.2 million to
extremists in locales ranging from the U.S. to the Balkans to Yemen.
And Barakat traveled tirelessly: Britain, Germany, Turkey, Italy,
Indonesia, Jordan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates. Not the itinerary
of a rug merchant, police say, but of an influential extremist
involved in strategy, finance and logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, all these many trips you have made around
practically half the world are related to your work?" Garzon asked,
according to a transcript obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of them yes, some no, some for a visit or
friendship or something," Barakat responded.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, Barakat has gone more than 20 times to London, the hub
of Al Qaeda in Europe. He told the judge he chose cheap
flights--"only $77 round-trip." In London, he stayed with his friend
Abu Qatada, a cleric regarded as Al Qaeda's spiritual leader outside
Afghanistan. Police found a copy of Barakat's passport in Abu
Qatada's home.</TE>
<TE>   "Abu Qatada was like a godfather who oversaw" the terrorist
network in Europe, a Spanish police commander said. "Barakat was more
operational."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Madrid cell's significance, police say, they have not
deciphered tantalizing links to Sept. 11. For example: Barakat's
phone number was found in the papers of Said Bahaji, a fugitive
former roommate of hijacker Mohamed Atta.</TE>
<TE>   Barakat insists he did not know Bahaji or Atta. He denies that he
discussed the airborne attacks in advance during wiretapped phone
calls in August 2001 with an unidentified suspect in London named
Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 27 call, Shakur told Barakat in a secretive tone he was
taking classes that would last about a month and that "in the
classes, we have entered into the field of aviation and we have even
cut the bird's throat."</TE>
<TE>   Barakat admitted the conversations were in code but said he didn't
know what Shakur meant with his talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Shakur is key," a Spanish law enforcement official said. The
conversations suggest Barakat was a mentor to Shakur, the official
said. Investigators are convinced that Shakur, believed to be a
Moroccan extremist, was aware of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Some investigators believe the Sept. 11 hijackers kept their
distance from the Madrid cell and the rest of the European network to
ensure maximum security. Others allege that Barakat's cell played a
support role, perhaps even recruiting plotters and setting up an
important meeting that Atta held on the coast near Tarragona.</TE>
<TE>   Police think that meeting in July 2001 took place in a safe house
and required local assistance. Police are looking for a mysterious
Algerian who had lived in the beach town that Atta visited; the
Algerian later accompanied Bahaji when he escaped Hamburg for Karachi
days before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish police in April made a find that suggests the Madrid cell
may have conducted reconnaissance in the United States. Police
serving a search warrant found startling videos of the World Trade
Center taped by Ghasoub al-Abrash Ghalyoun, an associate of Barakat
and Muhamed Galeb, the cell's alleged finance boss.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the five videos that Al-Abrash shot in August 1997 were
devoted to the trade center towers, inside and out. He also took
extensive footage of potential targets: the Golden Gate Bridge, the
Brooklyn Bridge, the Sears Tower, Universal Studios, Disneyland and a
New York airport.</TE>
<TE>   In his narration, he referred to other people who would look
at the tapes and to his fear of getting caught, giving the impression
that he was a scout, police said. The tapes show suspected U.S.
members of the Muslim Brotherhood with him.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after Al-Abrash returned, one of his close associates
met in the town of Castellon with an alleged courier for Osama bin
Laden, according to investigators. Police are investigating whether
the courier received copies of the tapes from the associate or
Al-Abrash himself. Al-Abrash was arrested in July.</TE>
<TE>   The accused courier, Mohamed Baiah, lived in Turkey and allegedly
traveled between Afghanistan and Europe. He was one of many holy
warriors who found refuge at Barakat's Madrid apartment, according to
police.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his hospitality to desperados, Barakat blamed his
faith.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a thing, we Muslims or Arabs," Barakat told the judge.
"In the mosque, I see a guy whom I don't know.... If he asks, can he
sleep in my house one or two days, I might let him. It's a very
normal thing in our countries."</TE>

<HD>Toll-Road System Deserves Support</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DICK ACKERMAN</AU>
<BD>Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine) is a state senator.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toll roads have been in the news a lot lately, and some people wonder
if they were a mistake. To the contrary, Orange County's public toll
road system has breathed life into the local economy and is a symbol
of innovation.</LD>
<LD>   When our civic leaders realized in the early 1980s that Interstate
5 would not be able to accommodate impending population growth,
additional freeways were mapped out. Unfortunately, the state said
that it had no money to build them. Absent tax dollars, the only way
the roads could be built was to finance them through bonds and make
them toll roads.</LD>
<LD>   This is a public toll-road system, however, and once the bonds are
paid off, they will serve as "freeways," as they were originally
planned. But with California currently running $24 billion in the
red, it's a good thing Orange County didn't wait for the state to
come up with the funding. Without the toll roads, Interstate 5 would
be as congested as the Riverside Freeway, businesses in the area
would be suffering, and the quality of life in Orange County would be
substantially affected.</LD>
<TE>   The toll roads have played a key role in fueling Orange County's
economic engine. Western Digital, Oakley, Black &amp; Decker and other
companies probably would not be headquartered in southern Orange
County if it weren't for the convenient access that toll roads
provide. The economic vitality of these and other businesses in
Orange County depend on an efficient ground transportation system.</TE>
<TE>   With freeway congestion worsening daily, it is essential that
clients and customers have an alternative such as the toll roads,
which give them convenient access to central and southern Orange
County businesses.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to note that the Transportation Corridor Agencies,
which built and operate the toll roads, are two joint powers
authorities. These are public agencies governed by elected officials
from the cities and unincorporated county areas adjacent to the toll
roads. Elected representatives, not private investors, sit on the two
boards of directors and make policy decisions to help enhance
mobility in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   That is why I am conceptually in favor of the Orange County
Transportation Authority's efforts to take over the 91 Express Lanes.
Assembly Bill 1010, which recently passed a Senate committee vote,
would give OCTA the authority to collect tolls until the cost of the
construction of the lanes has been paid off.</TE>
<TE>   If OCTA gets the authority to collect tolls, safeguards like those
that exist in the TCA toll road system must be put in place to ensure
that Orange County taxpayers are not at risk.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA is considering a consolidation of its boards to reduce
bureaucracy and increase efficiency. The proposed consolidation will
also allow the new board to refinance its debt, which would probably
ease the financial pressure on the San Joaquin Hills tollway and
renew Wall Street's faith in the leadership of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   We need to run our governmental agencies more like businesses to
encourage the development of entrepreneurial solutions to our
regional problems, especially our increasing need to improve our
crumbling infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-one miles of the planned 67-mile toll road system have been
built; now we just have to finish the job. The Foothill tollway now
ends at Oso Parkway. If the final connection is built, the toll road
system would be complete, and residents and businesses in San
Clemente would have a much-needed alternative to Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   But the toll roads have proved to be more than just a convenient
alternative. They are a necessity for many of the 220,000 daily users
who rely on them to get to work.</TE>
<TE>   Alternative roads are needed, not only for the continued success
of local businesses, but also for anyone who prefers spending more
time with their loved ones to sitting in traffic. The continued
financial health of the toll roads must be taken seriously because
independent public agencies like the TCA are an integral part of our
county's economic health.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA is taking the necessary steps to preserve the financial
integrity of the toll roads while providing convenient alternatives
to congested freeways.</TE>

<HD>A Map for 91 Express Lanes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M.W. MOORLACH</AU>
<BD>John M.W. Moorlach is Orange County treasurer-tax
collector.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone is in agreement that a public agency should purchase the 91
Express Lanes from California Private Transportation Co. And by this
morning we'll know whether or not AB 1010 has made it through the
legislative traffic jam in Sacramento to the governor's desk,
clearing the way for the Orange County Transportation Authority to
buy and operate the toll lanes.</LD>
<LD>   But whether or not AB 1010 is signed into law, it isn't clear that
OCTA is necessarily the best public agency to operate the toll lanes.
There is still a need for a true public dialogue in Orange County on
this critical transportation issue.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly three years ago I asked the governor to "tear down these
cones" on the Riverside Freeway Express Lanes. Now, three proposals
have surfaced that merit serious consideration. And if we take a
regional approach to our transportation needs, there may even be a
better alternative.</LD>
<TE>   The first proposal is for OCTA to purchase the Express Lanes from
the company. Absolutely. Let's put this private-public fiasco out of
its misery.</TE>
<TE>   But the "appraisal" prepared by Ernst &amp; Young that calls for OCTA
to pay $202 million to $220 million is probably $20 million to $25
million too generous. The best price to pay the company is in the
$180-million-to-$185-million range. The replacement cost is $180
million.</TE>
<TE>   Give the company an 8% annual return on its investment and the
price moves to $183 million. Other standard valuation methods,
including the capitalization rate and discount rate, given current
financial results, suggest that the proposed purchase price would be
very liberal.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA, however, is not a toll road operator, so it must go through
significant legislative hoops to become one. AB 1010, carried by
Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), was designed to let OCTA collect
tolls on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The second idea calls for the Transportation Corridor Agencies to
build a tunnel through the Santa Ana Mountains. We definitely need an
alternate route to the Inland Empire. A tunnel is as technologically
feasible, environmentally sensitive and financially achievable as a
toll road. This option deserves serious consideration.</TE>
<TE>   The third idea is to build a highway next to the Riverside
Freeway, using railroad right of way. It's an interesting proposal.
It would be beneficial to determine if a double-deck road over a
railroad right of way is economically viable.</TE>
<TE>   I consider that proposal to be very tenuous from a financial
perspective. Think about it: If it were viable, then why haven't we
pursued building a deck over existing freeway lanes? At least with a
tunnel, we can compare the proposal with projects around the globe,
including the costs and success rates.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the fourth alternative. OCTA is not the natural agency to
be purchasing the Express Lanes. A superior alternative already
exists--the toll road agency.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA operates two toll roads and has the infrastructure to
handle the dashboard transponders. The company generates about $20
million in annual toll revenue. Half of the revenue is used to retire
debt. The remainder is spent on administrative expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA should be able to reduce these expenditures by at least
40% because it has staffing and technology already in place. CPTC's
current salaries and benefits of $2.8 million per year will be
greatly reduced, as will $1.6 million in annual general and
administrative expenses.</TE>
<TE>   For now, let's assume those costs can be cut in half, for $2.2
million in savings. Eliminate contracted services ($1 million),
advertising, professional fees and other duplicated costs ($1.2
million) and the combined operations would save another $2.2 million
per year for a total of $4.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   If the TCA purchases the Express Lanes at a reasonable price--say
$185 million--it could then:</TE>
<TE>   Provide easy access to the Foothill toll road from both directions
on the Riverside Freeway's carpool and non-carpool lanes, helping to
move traffic more efficiently and encouraging additional use of the
express lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Consider building a tunnel to Lake Matthews from the Foothill toll
road. Preliminary studies indicate toll revenues will be sufficient
to service construction debt.</TE>
<TE>   Complete the extension of the Foothill toll road to Interstate 5,
thus easing traffic on the only San Diego-bound public freeway and
encouraging more drivers to utilize what would become a totally
integrated toll road network.</TE>
<TE>   I believe this would make the TCA, or its reconstituted successor,
a financially viable entity. It would solve Orange County's long-term
transportation needs, deal with the San Joaquin toll road's fiscal
problems and provide funds needed to more quickly "tear down the
cones."</TE>
<TE>   It would also provide an opportunity for improved cooperation with
neighboring counties' transportation agencies. In fact, an expanded
joint-powers agency that included Riverside and San Diego counties
would be a prudent long-term strategy for addressing our joint
transportation congestion problems.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum on addressing transportation concerns in Orange County
and Southern California is beginning to develop. Let's focus on where
we want to end up. Let's hope the political will and leadership exist
to see planning through to its natural fruition.</TE>
<TE>   Easing traffic congestion is something we can all agree on.
Pursuing a cooperative long-term solution is the course we must
pursue.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MTA buses struck and killed two pedestrians and injured a third
Saturday in two separate incidents in West Los Angeles and Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   Hannah Maizes, 67, of Century City was killed and an unidentified
62-year-old woman from San Francisco was critically injured when they
were struck by a Metropolitan Authority bus at 2:15 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The Line 28 bus, which runs between downtown and West Los Angeles,
was southbound on Century Park West and turning left onto Little
Santa Monica Boulevard when it hit the women, Fire Department
spokesman Bob Collis said. Police said witnesses told officers that
the women were in the crosswalk. An MTA spokesman said that crosswalk
does not have a traffic signal.</LD>
<TE>   The bus driver, a 45-year-old woman, was not arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're treating it as an accident," Los Angeles Police
Sgt. Robert Topete said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured pedestrian was taken to UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The second incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. at Laurel Canyon
Boulevard and Chatsworth Drive. The MTA bus was traveling about 15
mph south on Laurel Canyon when a pedestrian suddenly jumped off the
curb and ran in front of the bus, LAPD Officer Dave Chong said. The
man, who was pinned under the bus, was taken to Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills, where he was pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be a suicide, but we're not sure," said MTA spokesman Rick
Jager.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD detectives were investigating both incidents. Authorities
planned to test both drivers for drugs and alcohol.</TE>

<HD>'Killer Algae' Like Terminator in Thwarting Drive to Kill
It Off</HD>
<DH>Nature: The invasion off Huntington Beach and Carlsbad can
be slowed, but eradication so far proves impossible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite spending millions of dollars, state and federal officials
have failed to eradicate "killer algae," a noxious emerald-green weed
that has taken root off Huntington Beach and Carlsbad.</LD>
<LD>   "We are seeing a reduced number of colonies," said Bob Hoffman of
the National Marine Fisheries Service, the lead federal agency in the
fight. But "it's just amazing how adaptable and resistant it is to
being eradicated."</LD>
<LD>   Caulerpa taxifolia, a Caribbean plant, is popular in saltwater
aquariums because of its brilliant green foliage. But released into
new environs, it smothers the sea floor and has already caused
extensive and costly damage off Europe. The plant is just one of
hundreds of exotic species changing marine ecosystems statewide, from
the San Francisco Bay to creeks in the Santa Monica Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   About two years ago, the plant was first discovered in this
nation--in Huntington Harbour on the Orange County coast and Agua
Hedionda Lagoon in Carlsbad, northern San Diego County. Experts
believe Caulerpa came from home aquarium owners who emptied tanks
into storm drains, and worry that there could be other undiscovered
infestations along the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   To imagine what would happen if the weed grew unchecked, one need
only look at the Mediterranean. A square-meter patch of it was found
below the window of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco in 1984.
Nearly two decades later, the killer now carpets more than 10,000
acres of ocean floor off Spain, France, Italy and Croatia, all
offshoots of that original patch. Once-popular scuba diving waters
are clogged with thick forests of the stuff. Commercial fishing and
boating have been cut off in formerly productive harbors.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said a coalition of state and government agencies have
spent $4 million trying to quell the two known outbreaks in the U.S.
When patches of Caulerpa are found, they are covered with tarps and
treated with chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   But two years of effort have not killed all of the algae at either
site, a hallmark of why this hardy weed spreads so easily. It can
survive 10 days out of the water, and leaving even one speck behind
can cause an outbreak. Caulerpa spreads through fragmentation--if a
small piece breaks off, it quickly establishes a new colony.</TE>
<TE>   In the Carlsbad lagoon, researchers recently checked 16 treated
patches. Fifteen appear to be clean, but the one with surviving
Caulerpa had been covered with a tarp the longest, about two years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of dumbfounding us. We don't have a good explanation,"
Hoffman said. "It's hard to believe a plant can be covered with the
tarp where light doesn't get through for two years and be able to
survive and--when exposed to favorable conditions--be able to grow
again."</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Harbour, some new sprouts were also found in a
spring survey.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach City Councilman Ralph H. Bauer, who lives on the
harbor, said, "We're very appreciative of the money being spent to
solve the problem. It's a shame someone had to empty their home
aquarium and cause all this difficulty. Hopefully, they'll keep at it
until it's solved."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture placed Caulerpa on its list of
noxious weeds three years ago, which makes it illegal to import into
the United States. In 2001, Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation making
it illegal to sell, possess, transfer or release the weed in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive monitoring and surveys are part of the eradication
effort, something officials say is key to containment.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that we need to maintain our monitoring efforts at
the infested sites in Southern California, probably for years to
come," said state Department of Fish and Game Director Robert Hight
in a written statement.</TE>

<HD>Cricket Spreads Its Wings</HD>
<DH>Sports: U.S. players are vying for the national title in
the British export today in Van Nuys. They have big plans for the
little-understood game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like their distant baseball player cousins, these athletes wield
bats, score runs, play innings and gulp Gatorade.</LD>
<LD>   But the stars on this Van Nuys field Saturday weren't thinking
about the impact of an averted strike, new team luxury taxes or a
declining television audience.</LD>
<LD>   These players were focused on a game of cricket, obscure in
America, but close to their immigrant roots.</LD>
<TE>   There they stood in their all-white uniforms--long pants,
polo-style shirts--swinging a piece of equipment that is a cross
between an oar and a bat, intent on scoring a run by hitting a hard
red ball.</TE>
<TE>   Players from Florida, New York, Ohio and Oregon who grew up in
foreign lands such as Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan converged on
Woodley Park this holiday weekend to pursue their version of a great
American pastime: winning a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Cricket Is Life," read Aijaz Alli's T-shirt. "When I came to this
country, I thought my cricket days were done for good," said Alli, a
24-year-old Pakistani immigrant who lives in Santa Clarita. "Then I
found the league."</TE>
<TE>   The league is the 15,000-member United States of America Cricket
Assn., the group that sponsors amateur weekend players, many of whom
stumbled on the league as if it were a pick-up basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was jogging through Woodley Park, and I couldn't believe it. I
saw guys playing cricket," said Nasir Durrani, 24, an Ohio college
student in the midst of a Los Angeles engineering internship, who
joined the L.A. league last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Today at 10 a.m., all-star teams from New York and Los Angeles
will vie for the title of American Cricket Champions. Then, a team
with the best of the best will be selected to play other
international amateur teams.</TE>
<TE>   This is the league's first national championship, a rare chance
for players to match their skills against the best in their adopted
nation.</TE>
<TE>   With a $200,000 annual budget--half from a professional
international league and the other from U.S. donors--the American
league paid for the players' air fare and hotel stays. Otherwise,
their biggest expenditure this year was a $15,000 heavy-duty
motorized roller to compact the prized Wood- ley Park Field.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way these guys would be able to afford to play in a
tournament without help," said Atul Rai, president of the U.S.
Cricket Assn. and a Santa Barbara dentist.</TE>
<TE>   Cricket may be an obscure sport in America: What's that they use?
Bats? Sticks? Do they throw it? Roll it? Run for it? And from a
distance, the players make a decidedly English portrait, looking much
like a group of genteel, white-clad croquet players.</TE>
<TE>   But up close, the guys are spitting on the ball and rubbing it
smooth to make it aerodynamic. The game is similar to baseball, only
the ball is supposed to bounce off the ground once before it's
swatted by the batter.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of running around a diamond to score, players run across
the field. The opposing team stops the run by throwing the ball and
hitting a wooden wicket, much like throwing the ball to base. The
"bowler," or pitcher equivalent, is allowed to hit the players with
the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "See that guy over there? Yesterday he got hit on the cheek," said
Arjunan Ethirveerasingam of Cerritos. "We iced it down. He's OK. But
that's the nature of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   For the thousands of U.S. players, most of them immigrants, the
game is like an old familiar afternoon lifted out of childhood
memories.</TE>
<TE>   The ethnic diversity of cities such as Los Angeles and New York
brings men of many nations together to play what they still like to
call " a gentleman's sport," for their tradition of politely
deferring to the umpire's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has 40 teams, the state of New York more than
120. Strong teams also can be found in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   First popularized in England in the 1700s, cricket was then
exported to Britain's colonies and thrives as a professional sport in
places including Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and
Jamaica. The biggest professional games can pack a stadium of
100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Woodley Park cricket field--one of only two dedicated cricket
fields in the country, the other in Florida--is known as the best
maintained field.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, it turns out, has cricket in its history. Col.
Griffith J. Griffith, who donated the land for Griffith Park in 1896,
was a cricket player himself and requested that a field be maintained
on the land, according to Rai.</TE>
<TE>   The city Recreation and Parks Department opened the Woodley Park
field in the 1970s, and volunteers from the cricket association have
helped maintain it since.</TE>
<TE>   Rai and the players have plans to keep cricket alive in America.
Already they have launched a local elementary school program,
especially attractive to immigrant children from countries where
cricket it popular. Perhaps a sponsor or two will donate money to
help train players and pay for coaches and travel expenses.</TE>
<TE>   In 2005, the best players in the nation hope to travel to Ireland
for a tournament that could qualify them to play in the amateur
version of the World Cup of cricket.</TE>
<TE>   "Satellite TV, that would be cool," said Ethirveerasingam.</TE>

<HD>Camp Opens Eyes of Have-Nots, Have-Lots</HD>
<DH>Children of the affluent are counselors to kids from poor
areas. Malibu visit gives some their first look at ocean. Both groups
learn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the rock wall climbing, lanyard weaving and campfire singing at
Camp Harmony in Malibu would have been a good enough escape for 200
campers bused in from shelters for the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   And the community service points earned by about 80 Gap-wearing
teenagers who volunteered as camp counselors was a fair enough
reward.</LD>
<LD>   But something else happened on the shady campground nestled on a
hill beside the Pacific Ocean. In the kids' own words, their eyes
were opened. Their hearts and minds were changed.</LD>
<TE>   Tears blurred the once-clear dividing lines of age and class in a
den of seven campers and three teen counselors during a
candle-lighting ceremony on a recent Sunday evening, their final
night together at camp.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer counselor and high school junior Graham Littlefield, a
self-described "manly man" with Gucci shades, told his campers,
"Material things are not what matters. We may have different
circumstance but, with the right attitude, you can do anything you
want. You can have happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Garcia, a weeping 11-year-old in donated play clothes,
thanked Graham, who attends the private Windward School, for taking
the boys swimming and making them laugh. Abraham moved out of a Sun
Valley shelter just after leaving camp last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep-away summer camps like this one are, for the most part,
getaways for the haves and have-lots. But Camp Harmony took its
campers from Los Angeles-area shelters or after-school programs for
severely impoverished youths from 7 to 11 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Yasmeen Badillo, 9, said swimming was her favorite activity at
first. Some of the kids never get into a pool until the five-day
camp. Others live only miles away from Los Angeles County's 79 miles
of coastline but had never seen the ocean until the bus turned onto
Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Yasmeen has lived in a shelter for the homeless for the three
years she's been going to the summer camp. Camp has given her a break
from helping her mother care for her baby sister. It also has made
her more interested in school because children may not return if they
don't keep up their grades.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to work hard on my times tables when I go back to
school," Yasmeen said. "My dad told me math is going to be harder in
the fourth grade, and I want to come back. So, I'm working on it."</TE>
<TE>   For the mostly college-prep students who come from the Westside
and San Fernando Valley to volunteer, the five-day camp offered an
exhausting but welcome departure from what might have been a
self-centered summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, we're all well off and used to making our own schedules
and not worrying about someone else," said Katie Dewitt, a junior at
Harvard-Westlake High School. "This is so different. My days are
consumed with the campers and putting them first. It's not what we're
used to, but it's good for me."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the s'moresey goodness of camp relationships, the younger
kids walked away with a new wardrobe for school. Oprah Winfrey
donated $100,000 through her Oprah's Angel Network, and Land's End
threw in a duffle bag full of clothing for each camper.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the campers come from loving families, but going to the
beach or playing golf is just not in the scope of things they do,"
said Robin Segal, who founded Camp Harmony 13 years ago and is among
90 adult volunteers. "Many of them come from very loving homes with
very limited means. They need to see what else is out there. And the
teenagers need to see how the other half lives."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the camp's $100,000 budget comes from donations. Artists,
musicians, even a food stylist share their expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Camp ended Monday and, as they headed back to their regular lives,
campers and counselors said they would take home a new perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Yasmeen learned that appearances and material things really don't
matter when it comes to friends. The counselors have more clothes,
and nicer clothes, than she does, but Yasmeen and the counselors had
a great time together. She said she would keep that in mind when she
returned to the shelter with her new outfits.</TE>
<TE>   The other children may not have clothes as fine as hers, but that
won't lessen them in her eyes. "They will still be my friends,"
Yasmeen said. "And maybe they will come to camp next year."</TE>
<TE>   Graham, the counselor, has begun a journal that recaps his camp
experience, hoping to use it as part of his application to be a
counselor next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It may take a while for me to soak in how much I might have
affected one of these young kids' lives," he said. "I'm also
reflecting on how much they changed my life and how much better off I
am for meeting them."</TE>

<HD>Mother of 9-Year-Old Is Charged With Abduction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside County authorities said Saturday that they had charged
Debra Rose, the mother of the 9-year-old boy abducted from his
father's Palm Desert home by two gunmen, with felony child abduction
and had set her bond at $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Deputy Lisa McConnell said more charges were pending
against Rose, 38, of Colorado Springs, Colo., who is suspected of
having orchestrated the violent abduction of the boy from the house
he shares with his father. Federal authorities also were expected to
file charges against Rose.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators also said Saturday that they had identified the male
companion found with Rose on Friday at a campground in Jamul, 20
miles east of San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   The man, 48-year-old Michael James Riley, was not believed to be
one of the men who had abducted Nicholas Michael Farber about 2 a.m.
Wednesday and beaten his father, said sheriff's Sgt. Mike Alcorn.
"There is nothing to my knowledge that puts him inside the house,"
Alcorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who apparently is Rose's companion, was booked on suspicion
of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, conspiracy to commit assault with
a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit residential burglary, Alcorn
said. His bond also was set at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Riley is wanted on a felony warrant in Lincoln, Neb., that charges
him with financial crimes. He also is accused of felony violation of
probation in Tucson, Ariz., in connection with another financial
crime, Riverside County officials said. No further information on
those allegations was available.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was reunited Friday night with his father, Michael
Farber, 47, a restaurant manager. "The boy was happy to see his
father again," McConnell said. "They left together ... and are in
seclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were looking for the gunmen who had carried out the
abduction and for Carla Bender, Rose's former roommate in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Bender has been conspicuously absent," Alcorn said. "We really
have not heard from her. Obviously, we want to interview her to see
what her involvement is on this."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas' parents were married in 1991 and divorced in 1995. He is
the subject of a custody dispute. He had lived with his mother in
Colorado until earlier this month, when she was briefly jailed for
violating a temporary restraining order in an unrelated case
involving another former husband. She and Michael Farber had a court
date Thursday in Orange County to resolve the custody issue.</TE>

<HD>Simon and Davis Prove It's Time for a New Voice: None of
the Above</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica City Councilman Kevin McKeown on California politics:</LD>
<LD>   "When people laud the benefits of a two-party system, I tell them
I wish we had one."</LD>
<LD>   Ain't it the truth. At a time when it would be nice to move toward
a three-party system, for the sake of adding a fresh perspective to
the discussion, California seems to be headed in the other direction.</LD>
<TE>   Both the Assembly and state Senate are overrun with Democrats, and
the governor is a Democrat as far as anyone can tell. Meanwhile, the
state Republican Party is clinging to a life raft that's thrashing
against the rocks, piloted by a man with tax shelter problems and a
$78-million fraud judgment against his family business.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, people are not taking to the streets and
turning cartwheels over the work of Gov. Gray Davis. In a survey by
the Public Policy Institute of California, half the voters registered
as Democrats said they're not tickled with any of the choices in the
fall election, and who can blame them?</TE>
<TE>   "Democratic and Republican registration have both declined over
time," says the institute's David Baldassare, whose latest book is "A
California State of Mind: The Conflicted Voter in a Changing World."
"The biggest growth is in the number of people who describe
themselves as 'decline to state.' "</TE>
<TE>   That number is 2.2 million, or 15% of the electorate, and growing.
So maybe there's hope, after all, for a third voice in California
politics--the None of the Above Party.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if there's no difference between the two major
parties, says Councilman McKeown, a Green Party member himself
running for reelection. The problem is there is not enough of a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   All of which--on Labor Day weekend, the traditional start of the
campaign season--is my way of saying you don't have to vote "R" and
you don't have to vote "D." Six people are running for governor, so
look farther down the list, and set yourself free.</TE>
<TE>   If I told you there's a candidate who's smart, funny, and burned
up about all the sellouts in American politics, you'd be interested,
am I right?</TE>
<TE>   If I told you he won't take a corporate nickel to finance his
campaign, because he abhors the way both parties have been co-opted,
you'd want to know more, wouldn't you?</TE>
<TE>   And here's the capper. What if I told you Ronald Reagan once
called him one of the most dangerous men in California?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of that," says Peter Miguel Camejo, the Green
Party candidate who wears a button that says "Vote Green, Not Gray."
The Reagan smear goes back more than 30 years, by the way, to
Camejo's days as a UC Berkeley anti-war demonstrator. In 1976, he ran
for president as a socialist.</TE>
<TE>   These days the Bay Area resident mixes the pink with red, white
and blue, running an investment house that favors companies with a
social conscience. His political passions include universal health
care, mass transit, zero population growth and a reversal of the
widening divide between rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Very difficult," he says after naming those and other tasks, then
follows it up with, "Has to be done."</TE>
<TE>   And how?</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I'd do is take the for-sale sign down in
Sacramento. I swear to God, if I got elected there'd be a party that
would go on for days when people realize here's a governor who's not
spending his days raising more money.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd bring in professional expertise for long-term planning to
protect our environment. We'd switch to renewable energy, build
affordable housing, balance the budget. Very difficult. Has to be
done."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the math on Camejo's chances has to be done too. He
came up with a scant 4% in last week's PPIC poll, same as Libertarian
Party candidate Gary David Copeland. But that's not because voters
don't like him; it's because they don't know him.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the GOP's Bill Simon and, in particular, Gov. Davis, Camejo
doesn't have the dough to beam his name into your living room. With
his low poll numbers, he might not even be invited to the debates.
And as you may have noticed--or not--the media are not monitoring his
every move.</TE>
<TE>   It's that chicken-and-egg problem. Does he get ignored because he
doesn't have enough true believers and represents a party with just
144,000 registered voters? Or does he have so few true believers
because he gets ignored?</TE>
<TE>   It's a little of both. And Simon's disastrous campaign hasn't
helped raise Camejo's profile. If Simon were in the hunt, Camejo
might have stood a chance of scaring the snot out of Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the links between corporate greed and political
prostitution have never been more clear, and Camejo is in a better
position to connect the dots than either Davis or Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, he's a Latino candidate--Camejo was born in New York to
a wealthy family from Venezuela--in a state where Latino registration
has grown by 1 million in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been getting roaring responses from mostly Latino
audiences," says Antonio Gonzalez, president of Southwest Voter
Registration. "This guy is charismatic, and he gives a great
stem-winding speech with a funny, biting wit."</TE>
<TE>   I used one of Camejo's lines in my Wednesday column.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you get Gray Davis to change his position on an issue?
Tell him the check bounced."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992 in California, the number of registered Democrats has
fallen by 500,000 to 6.9 million. The number of registered
Republicans has fallen by 300,000 to 5.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Can the None of the Above Party continue to rise?</TE>
<TE>   Very difficult. Has to be done.</TE>

<HD>A Faith Flows Across Time</HD>
<DH>Religion: In Aliso Viejo, a family's three generations join
in an unusual form of the Jewish rite of passage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In front of a teary-eyed congregation, Chaim Pollak, a survivor of
Nazi concentration and labor camps, passed the Torah to his daughter,
Celia. The sacred scrolls containing Hebrew Scripture had been pieced
together from four Torahs burned by German forces during World War
II.</LD>
<LD>   Celia then handed the Torah to her eldest daughter, Estee. And
Estee's three sisters each took a turn holding it, a symbolic act to
show the Jewish faith being passed from generation to generation.</LD>
<LD>   "It was very emotional," said Chaim Pollak, 73. "We tried very
hard to give them faith. We did our best."</LD>
<TE>   In a twist on the usual Bar (for a boy) or Bat (for a girl)
Mitzvah ceremony, Celia, 47, and her four children together became
B'not Mitzvah ("Daughters of the Commandment") after helping lead the
Saturday morning Shabbat service at Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo.
Normally, one or two adolescents at a time go through the ceremony, a
rite of passage usually done about age 13.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in Allen Krause's 35-year career as a rabbi
that five family members went through the ceremony at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "You fill us with feelings of great hope for the Jewish people,"
he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Celia Pollak, born in Israel and now living in Laguna Niguel, was
raised in an Orthodox congregation, where Bat Mitzvah ceremonies were
not held because women could not take lead roles in the synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, the single mother had never considered having her
daughters become B'not Mitzvah (the plural of Bat Mitzvah), though
her family had attended Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue that
encourages the ceremony, for a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't give it much thought," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But then her third daughter, 14-year-old Rachel, announced that
she wanted to go through the ceremony. Celia Pollak pointed out that
if she held a Bat Mitzvah for one daughter, she should make the
opportunity available to the others: Estee, 21; Sarah, 16; and
Hannah, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughters liked the idea, but added another wrinkle that took
the form of an ultimatum.</TE>
<TE>   "We told her, 'You either do this with us too, or we're not doing
it,' " Estee recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Celia said she initially hoped her daughters' enthusiasm for her
participation would fade.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of just ignored it, hoping it would go away," she said.
"It's a lot of work, and it's scary. But the girls kept nudging me
and bugging me."</TE>
<TE>   Her rabbi also did his part the moment he heard the idea. "I
jumped on it immediately," Krause said. "I didn't want Celia or her
daughters to get away. I think the health of a synagogue is
reflective on how well it passes tradition to the next generation. So
this is very symbolic for us."</TE>
<TE>   The five Pollak females divvied up parts of the Saturday service,
taking turns reading, praying and chanting in Hebrew. Junior high,
high school and college friends waved and gave thumbs-up signs each

<HD>Indians Face Dilemma of Toxic Relics</HD>
<DH>Antiquities: Preservative substances used by early curators
raise health and religious questions for tribes seeking the return of
their sacred items.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the Elem Indians, the feathered headdresses and ceremonial
sackcloth dresses in the possession of state parks officials are
tortured souls, imprisoned for years on a Sacramento storage shelf.</LD>
<LD>   So it has been painful for the small Northern California tribe to
finally reclaim the sacred items, created by their ancestors decades
ago, only to discover that they may have been doused with poison.</LD>
<LD>   The Elem recently invoked a 12-year-old federal law to persuade
the California Department of Parks and Recreation to return the items
to their reservation. But they soon learned that the artifacts--like
thousands of other Indian relics stored around the country--may be
loaded with toxic pesticides and preservatives applied by early
curators.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know what we're going to do," said an Elem tribal
leader, Robert Geary, who expects the items to be returned in the
next few weeks. "We want to wear them in our dances, but they could
have stuff that can get under your skin and really do some
damage....When our dance regalia are worn out, our tradition is to
send them back into the water. If they're toxic, how are we even
going to get rid of them?"</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, more and more tribes have used the 1990 Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to reclaim important
religious objects that have found their way into public art
collections--sometimes after being stolen or swindled away by
frontier-era whites.</TE>
<TE>   In the hope of strengthening native cultures, the act intended
that the items be reintroduced into modern Indian religious rituals.
Instead, some tribes are confronting unforeseen health and religious
issues because of substances used by generations of collectors who
never imagined that the Indians would get the items back.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Onondaga Nation of New York learned that 57 medicine
masks returned by the National Museum of the American Indian had been
contaminated with arsenic. In 1999, Arizona's Hopi people discovered
that a number of repatriated kachina dolls had been contaminated with
pesticides. The discovery was made after tribe members placed the
dolls in structures traditionally used to store grains and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   In California's Humboldt County, the Hoopa tribe is frustrated
that it has had to keep 17 pieces of mercury-laced dance regalia
locked away after they were reclaimed from Harvard University's
Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.</TE>
<TE>   "When this program started, I thought it was the greatest thing in
the world, because I could get these things back," said David
Hostler, coordinator of the Hoopa's tribal museum. "But now ... what
am I going to do if I get them back?"</TE>
<TE>   The use of dangerous substances such as arsenic and mercury to
preserve museum items began in the mid-18th century as curators tried
to better preserve their natural collections from decay--and
especially from the appetites of insects. It was only a few decades
ago that museums stopped using dangerous pesticides such as DDT, said
Catharine Hawks, a Washington, D.C.-area conservator.</TE>
<TE>   Though the methods are now considered unhealthful, Hawks said they
had succeeded in preserving many links to the past. "Most of this
stuff wouldn't be here if some of these substances weren't applied,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one can prove that exposure to the toxic artifacts has
made anyone ill, though scientists and tribal leaders said that it is
difficult to draw a direct line between exposure and sickness. At the
very least, however, native groups see yet another reason to be wary
of the dominant culture.</TE>
<TE>   "To realize that Hopi children may have been harmed by exercising
their beliefs and following our guidance is a great insult upon
injury," a tribe member, Micah Loma'omvaya, wrote in the journal
Collection Forum last year.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the federal government acknowledged the problem, and is
responding. This year, the National Park Service set aside a record
amount of federal money--four grants totaling $244,000--to educate
tribes about potential health hazards, said an agency spokeswoman,
Paula Molloy.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, museums do not have to pay for testing or
cleaning of contaminated items.</TE>
<TE>   But they do have to tell Indians if they know a piece is toxic.
Often, suspicion is all they have to go on, because most museums did
not keep records of the chemical preservatives they used.</TE>
<TE>   Native Americans such as Leigh Kuwanwisiwma, a Hopi cultural
preservation coordinator, want museums to pay for the cleanup. While
her tribe is still pursuing legal claims to sacred items, the relics
remain in museums until the federal government can work out a better
solution, Kuwanwisiwma said.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning the items has been difficult, if not impossible, said
Pete Palmer, a chemistry professor at San Francisco State University
who has been testing some contaminated objects for the last few
years. Part of the problem is that old animal skins and feathers are
very delicate.</TE>
<TE>   Testing them has proved costly and trying.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it is difficult to even know what to test for,
because early curators cooked up a bizarre collection of homemade
preservatives. Researchers know some curators used substances such as
mercury, naphthalene and DDT, but there are myriad possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the Elem costumes is a good illustration of the
problem. After a San Francisco State undergraduate tested the objects
for free, researchers last month announced that the items did not
contain mercury or arsenic.</TE>
<TE>   But the university's chemistry department, turned down in its bid
for federal funding, did not have the time or money to test for many
other common pesticides, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the Elem with some difficult decisions. Further
testing could cost as much as $600 per item, and about 30 relics are
being returned.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal leader Geary said his people were considering wearing the
costumes, but with cloth buffers that would prevent skin contact.</TE>
<TE>   Despite meager government resources, however, Palmer and others
said the education campaign alone will be welcome in California. For
many tribes, gambling proceeds have helped solve basic subsistence
problems, allowing them to pursue cultural goals with an
unprecedented vigor.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California alone, at least five museums are being
planned by Native American tribes, said Paul Apodaca, a sociology
professor at Chapman University in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   New Native American political muscle in Sacramento led last year
to the passage of a California repatriation law, which could
dramatically increase the number of repatriation requests statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, cultural resource experts hope that concerns about
Native Americans' health will alert museums to the hazards their
workers may be facing in their own collections.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and his colleagues have suggested that all museums with
extensive organic collections--from mummies to stuffed wildlife--test
for contaminants. They also believe museum employees should be
subjected to regular medical examinations.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is
conducting a small study of museum workers' exposure to arsenic and
mercury.</TE>
<TE>   A government industrial hygienist, Edward Burroughs, said the
study is testing for the substances at a handful of museums.</TE>
<TE>   Though the study is finding some questionable practices, he said,
workers generally appear to be protected from harmful exposure.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmer said many museums do not have the money to test for the
contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles' cash-strapped Southwest Museum--home to 225,000
Native American objects--chief curator Steve Grafe said the staff
operates on the "naive belief" that exposure levels are not harmful.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwanwisiwma of the Hopi tribe recalled one kachina doll that had
been found to be so contaminated that the Arizona Poison Control
Center pleaded with the tribe to keep it off the reservation.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, part of the problem is, we don't know how to dispose of
them," Kuwanwisiwma said. "To throw it away would be like giving a
death penalty to a fellow brother."</TE>

<HD>Chemical Spill Pollutes Town's Water System</HD>
<DH>Safety: Santa Fe Springs residents are advised not to drink
tap water after industrial detergent leaks from a factory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the small industrial city of Santa Fe Springs, residents woke up
Saturday morning to an unsettling note on their doorsteps:</LD>
<LD>   Do Not Drink Your Tap Water.</LD>
<LD>   So even as the temperature outside approached 90 degrees, water
from the faucet was taboo. Cooking and teeth brushing? Off-limits.
Showering? Fine, but keep your mouth shut.</LD>
<TE>   And those with sensitive skin, the city advised, should stay away
from tap water no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   Jessie Carlos said that when she read the flier on her front
porch, "Right away, I was thirsty."</TE>
<TE>   City officials issued the advisory after a material ironically
known as Aqua-Quench 3600 spilled into the water system Friday
afternoon. The liquid detergent, which is typically used to treat
metal parts, can cause nausea and diarrhea, though nobody had
reported any illnesses by Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The spill affected about 3,500 homes and businesses within a
2-square-mile area, according to City Manager Fred Latham. Automated
phone calls about the "industrial incident" were made at 11 p.m.
Friday, and city employees began delivering the notices shortly
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs residents were told they could pick up bottled
water at either the Neighborhood Center or Town Center Hall, where
50,000 gallons were available.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Berumen spent Friday night delivering notices door to door
and was back at work early Saturday morning loading bottled water
into residents' cars.</TE>
<TE>   By afternoon, the city worker estimated that he had given out
5,500 gallons.</TE>
<TE>   "Overtime, baby," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Geezer's Restaurant, owner Bob LaRue said he cooked with
bottled water, served canned sodas and didn't use the coffee machine.</TE>
<TE>   "But, heck, on a day like today, who wants coffee anyway," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other restaurants simply closed. At Jack in the Box, a sign in
Spanish and English read, "For the safety of the guests, due to water
contamination, we took the liberty to close."</TE>
<TE>   KFC opted to stop serving dishes that used water, such as mashed
potatoes and corn.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Philip Nieto, 26, said he found out about the spill just
after he had finished drinking a glass of water. The water tasted
fine, he said. Still, it was troublesome.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Zimmerman said she was giving her birds a drink Friday
night when she noticed bubbles in the water. She went out for some of
the city's free bottles.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can go water my birds," she said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 17,000 people live in Santa Fe Springs, which is about
15 miles southeast of Los Angeles and is 85% zoned for industrial
use.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as city officials learned of the spill, they contacted
state and county environmental authorities and flushed the water
system several times to clear out the murky, contaminated water.</TE>
<TE>   The city set up a command post and shut down water fountains at
parks. About 125 city employees and more than 30 volunteers "just did
what they needed to do, and it worked really well," said Fire
Battalion Chief Mark Maguire.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were investigating the cause of the spill, which
involved Bodykote, a company that produces metal parts for the
aerospace industry, Latham said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials expected tests to show that the water was again
safe to drink by late Saturday night, when they planned to issue a
new round of automated phone calls and distribute all-clear fliers.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way Charles Ford sees it, nothing is going to stop him from
driving his brand new Chevy Cavalier. So what if gas prices are high?
So what if he has more traffic tickets than he can remember? So what
if he's 102?</LD>
<LD>   He's still got a good eye for the road; he swears by it. After
all, he has been driving since Woodrow Wilson was in the White House,
back when some people were still getting around by mule.</LD>
<LD>   The latest ticket wasn't so hard to explain. He had a bridge game
to get to and didn't have time to wait for a traffic jam to clear. He
thought he'd drive down the other side of the road, far enough to
make a turn. But as soon as the lights flashed behind him, Ford knew
he was in trouble.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever I know I done something wrong, I don't put no squawk
with the police," he said, accepting the yellow slip that would cost
him $170. "I knew better."</TE>
<TE>   With his cane in one hand and his car keys in the other, Ford is
among 58 centenarians licensed to drive on California's streets.
There are 37 drivers who are 100 years old, 15 who are 101, three who
are 102, one who is 103 and two who have celebrated their 104th
birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Motor Vehicles doesn't disqualify
elderly drivers from obtaining licenses, but it does require those
older than 70 to renew them in person. Across the country, 19 states
require older drivers--typically older than 65 or 70--to renew their
licenses in person, to renew them more often or to pass road and
vision tests, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers older than 65 have very low accident rates and are not
threats to others on the road, according to a study by the institute.
But when they do get into accidents, they are more easily hurt and
less likely to survive their injuries, the study said. The death
rates for drivers 75 to 79 years old are more than four times as high
as those for 30-to 59-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone trusts someone who has been behind the
wheel since before most roads were built. Ford's friend from the
senior citizens center, Mignon Benjamin, said many old drivers grip
the steering wheel and never go above 20 mph. But not her friend, she
says with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   "Here comes Mr. Ford! Get out of his way!" said Benjamin, 73. "I
wouldn't ride with him for my life. He drives too fast."</TE>
<TE>   Ford passed a written exam this year to renew his California
driver's license for five more years. And a few months ago, he traded
in a 1981 Malibu station wagon and bought the 2002 gold Cavalier.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been a lover of beautiful women and beautiful cars,"
he said. "That's why I don't have any money today."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a recliner in the living room of his home south of
downtown, Ford keeps the door open to stay cool on a hot Los Angeles
summer day. A vase of blue carnations is on a counter, next to a
plastic crown he received on his 100th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has a wide smile and a clean shave, and his suspenders and
hat lie nearby on a mustard-colored couch, where he left them after a
headache caused him to cancel a bridge game with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Ford remembers the day he learned to drive as if it were
yesterday. It was 1918 and he was living in a rural Mississippi town.
The country was at war and a sawmill was being built nearby to make
wood spokes and rims for military vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   To Ford, the sawmill meant steady work because drivers would be
needed to haul logs. So when a neighbor was driving to a town 20
miles away and offered him a ride, Ford jumped in and carefully
watched every move the driver made. About six miles from home, he
took the wheel. Soon afterward, Ford got the job.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't have to have a license, but you had to prove you could
drive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression, Ford and his wife, Emma, hitched a ride to
Los Angeles. His wife got a job as a mother's helper, while he began
cleaning and doing yardwork. Together, they made $45 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he donned a cap and a uniform and became a chauffeur for a
Beverly Hills tailor, he said, delivering clothes to Clark Gable and
Edward G. Robinson, among others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, Ford finally scraped up enough money for a car.</TE>
<TE>   He paid about $30 for a black Ford roadster with a rumble seat,
shiny red wheels and fenders with lights.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful thing," he said, shaking his head. "It was a
sports car."</TE>
<TE>   Driving his very own wheels, Ford said, he felt like a rich man.
He didn't have to worry about taking the 5-cent streetcar anymore. It
was the year of Ford's first--he insists only--accident: Another
motorist ran into him.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic tickets have been another story.</TE>
<TE>   After Ford was cited for driving on the wrong side of the street
in February, he registered for traffic school to save money on his
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Inglewood courthouse, the Traffic Division clerks were
having trouble entering Ford's ticket information in the computer.</TE>
<TE>   His birth date is 10-2-99 and the computer kept processing it as
if he were 2 years old, said La Taunya Green, assistant supervisor of
the Inglewood Traffic Division.</TE>
<TE>   Green said that once she realized Ford's real age, she couldn't
wait to meet him. She dubbed him "Grand Centenarian Ticket Holder"
and told her staff to make sure to tell her when he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   When Ford came to court after finishing traffic school, he was
greeted by several eager clerks who snapped photographs. He walked
with his cane and got around without a problem, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just totally amazing," Green said. "We were just staring
at him. We were like, 'Hey Pops. Pops is rolling!' "</TE>
<TE>   Ford knows his mind isn't as sharp as it once was, so he tries to
drive less frequently. And when he does, he avoids driving at night
and tries to slow down. "When I was young and crazy, I'd get lots of
tickets," he said. "I'd take my chances."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore, especially after his ticket this spring. That sure
set him back, he says. But he still refuses to stop driving. He's got
places to be, groceries to buy and bridge games to play.</TE>
<TE>   His great-niece, Marva Hill, said her uncle is one of the most
independent and strong-willed people she has ever met--especially
when it comes to driving. He lives alone, although with frequent
visitors. "He's got a mind of his own," Hill said.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Although he recently was ticketed for driving down
the wrong side of the road to get around a traffic jam, Charles Ford,
102, loves to drive and is delighted to show off the new Chevy
Cavalier he has in his garage. He has no intention of giving up
driving; he has too much to do.</CP>

<HD>Muslims Adapt U.S. Tradition for 9/11 Tribute</HD>
<DH>Culture: Islamic Center volunteers embroider a handmade
quilt with the victims' names. The resulting work will be sent to New
York.</DH>

<LD>Hedab Tarifi received a crash course in quilting this month.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning at 5 p.m. every day for the last two weeks, Tarifi, 41,
along with two other women from the Islamic Center of Southern
California, worked until 1 a.m. or later, embroidering cursive
letters or stitching together 98 red, white and blue fabric squares.
They spent Saturday putting on borders and trim.</LD>
<LD>   The women expect to send the finished quilt, with about 3,000
embroidered names listed alphabetically, to New York next month.</LD>
<TE>   It is their way of remembering the victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, and reminding America that the Muslim community
has suffered too. Nearly 20 other volunteers from the Islamic Center
have also pitched in.</TE>
<TE>   Tarifi, a Palestinian who was raised in Kuwait, said quilting was
not popular in the countries where she formerly lived. But she wanted
to learn the American tradition because she now considers this
country her home.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, a quilt was a very American idea, and it was very fitting
to remember the victims," she said. "We wanted to show not only that
we are united in protecting America, but we are united also in pain."</TE>
<TE>   The names of those who perished in the World Trade Center in New
York, at the Pentagon or aboard the four airplanes that crashed Sept.
11 were embroidered on a blue background decorated with tiny white
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "It really gives you the feeling that they are up in heaven," said
Tarifi, who came up with the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Reading each name, however, was sorrowful, the women said.</TE>
<TE>   "You wondered about this person. What were they like?" said Jane
El Farra, 63, who worked on the quilt.</TE>
<TE>   "Did they have children?" said Helen Zarif, 51, another volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   The names on the quilt--such as Joseph Hassan, Margaret Lewis and
Kirsten Santiago--are a reminder that terrorism did not discriminate
that day, Tarifi said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at these names," she said. "You see different
backgrounds--Chinese, African, Pakistani, Indian. You look at them
and you are reminded of what America represents."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200 people whose names are on the quilt had Arabic names.</TE>
<TE>   The year since Sept. 11 has not been easy for the Muslim
community, Omar Ricci, chairman of the Muslim Public Affairs Council,
who assisted the women, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci said he had considered selling his home because he was
afraid of an anti-Muslim backlash. Even today, Ricci said, he is
nervous about some people's perceptions of Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "This [quilt] is a proper gesture. This is a heartfelt gesture,"
he said. "I worry that people will view this as a token gesture."</TE>
<TE>   Zarif said she also had struggled. Her three children were
questioned because they had Muslim names.</TE>
<TE>   "People would ask, 'How come you have a name like them? Do you
believe in terrorism?' "</TE>
<TE>   El Farra said she feared for the safety of Muslim women who wore
traditional veils that cover their faces.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some people's assumptions about Muslim Americans, the
community still has a duty to show they do not support terrorism,
Ricci said, and this quilt is a way to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Since people of my faith [attacked America] and claimed it was a
religious duty, it is my community's job to go the extra mile and
prove that it is not a part of our faith," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a special obligation, both as Americans and as Muslims."</TE>

<LD>A forest fire in the Lytle Creek area of San Bernardino County was
nearly 30% contained Saturday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,000 firefighters battled the blaze, which had scorched 463
acres. Investigators were searching the area where the fire began for
evidence of possible arson.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's detectives were also investigating the death of a man
whose badly burned body was found in the forest Friday. An abandoned
car also was discovered several hundred yards away.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service does not expect to have the fire contained
until Friday, because air turbulence in the canyon prevents the use
of water-dropping aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries had been reported and no structures had been damaged,
a spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Sign May Have Run Its Course</HD>
<DH>Border: Many say drop in pedestrian deaths means drivers no
longer need warnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The signs are hard to miss. They are 5 feet by 7 feet and warn
drivers on San Diego's busy freeways about the seemingly improbable:
that pedestrians, indeed entire families, could come dashing across
the lanes at any moment.</LD>
<LD>   But that picture is no longer accurate.</LD>
<LD>   A decade ago, the subject of those signs, illegal border crossers
from Mexico, used to die by the dozens every year as they
crisscrossed the freeways on their northbound treks to Los Angeles
and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   When Caltrans erected the signs in 1992, it also built 10-to
12-foot-high median fences on portions of Interstate 5 to discourage
the dangerous practice.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years ago, as part of Operation Gatekeeper, the U.S.
crackdown on the California border with Mexico, authorities built
fortified walls between San Diego and Tijuana that stemmed the human
flow and pushed it away to more remote, but no less deadly, areas to
the east.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a dramatic decrease in migrant-related
pedestrian fatalities. Today, migrants are more likely to die of
hypothermia or heat exhaustion crossing the deserts of Imperial
Valley than they are to be hit by cars on San Diego-area freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The border area "is still a dangerous place," said William Veal,
chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector. "But those signs are
no longer necessary because of the infrastructure we've built on the
border."</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Garcia, now retired as San Diego-area Caltrans director,
oversaw the original signs project. "I'm sure, someday," he said
recently, "someone will ask if those signs ought to come down, if it
hasn't happened already."</TE>
<TE>   It has.</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego newspaper columnist has proposed that the signboards
now belong in a museum rather than on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans said some of its own field workers also have suggested
the signs are no longer necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heard some comments out there that the signs may have
outlived their usefulness," said Steve Seville, a California
Department of Transportation spokesman. "There are no formal plans
[to take them down], but we are open to suggestion."</TE>
<TE>   In their decade of existence, the signs--a stark silhouette of a
man, a woman and a child running--have evoked more than a simple
traffic threat.</TE>
<TE>   They have spawned countless souvenirs and artistic interpretations
of the country's uneasy relationship with illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Some have called the signs racist, saying they imply a region
overrun by people deemed undesirable. They have also come to
represent the immigrant plight, the impulse to make it to America
whatever the risks.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I saw the sign," said artist Joe Lewis, "I found
it really disturbing. It almost seemed like it was saying it was open
season [on immigrants], almost like a deer crossing sign. People were
getting killed going for a better life."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, dean of art and design at New York's Fashion Institute of
Technology and a former Californian, recently created a piece based
on the signs--a 50-by-80-inch wall made of salt blocks carved with an
image of the running family.</TE>
<TE>   The installation is part of an exhibition titled "Mixed Feelings:
Art and Culture in the Postborder Metropolis." It opens Wednesday at
USC's Fisher Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   The signs may have lost their relevance, Lewis said, but they
still speak volumes about the pull that brings immigrants to the U.S.
And the people continue to come, "but they are dying in different
locations, of different causes," said Claudia Smith, director of the
border project of the Oceanside-based office of the California Rural
Legal Assistance Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is an outspoken critic of Operation Gatekeeper, which she
and others blame for the hundreds of migrant deaths that have
occurred from Imperial Valley to Arizona. And she said that migrants
occasionally still are victims of freeway accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a young Mexican was found dead along Otay Mesa
Road near the border, an apparent hit-and-run victim.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the Mexican Consulate in San Diego confirmed that the
man had illegally crossed the border. The consulate did not return
calls requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol said the incident is still under
investigation. According to the CHP, pedestrian deaths on freeways
near the border have hovered between two and three annually in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   The agency does not record the immigration status of such victims,
but a spokesman said the deaths often involve drivers struck when
they venture out of their broken-down cars.</TE>
<TE>   In the five years before the signs went up in 1992, about 90
immigrants were killed along border-area freeways, mostly on or along
Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, near the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre,
another 40 were killed in the same period. The migrants were hit as
they tried to get around the inspection point by crossing the freeway
on foot and re-boarding cars north of the checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of signs continue to caution drivers approaching the
checkpoint, even though there have been no pedestrian fatalities
there in at least four years.</TE>
<TE>   Smith sees no cause for cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "All they have done," she said, "is to move the flow out of the
urban areas ... to give an appearance of border control."</TE>

<HD>Union Station Helped Turn a City Into a Metropolis</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union Station, a monument to the entwined elements of history and
transportation, was a Johnny-come-lately as train stations go, but it
played a leading role in making Los Angeles into the nation's
second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a century, the mighty transcontinental railroads had
helped to transform Los Angeles from an isolated town of 10,000 into
a modern megalopolis. But getting them to unite behind a single
station, a Union Station, was a task almost as difficult as bringing
the railroads west. In 1869, railroad workers drove the golden spike
at Promontory, Utah, joining the Union Pacific and the Southern
Pacific into a seamless transcontinental route.</LD>
<LD>   The same year, Gen. Phineas Banning built the first railway south
of the Tehachapi Mountains: the San Pedro &amp; Los Angeles Railroad. On
the locomotive, a sign painter lettered "LOS ANGELOS," an error
discovered in the nick of time for the maiden run.</LD>
<TE>   Banning's railway covered the 22 miles between San Pedro and
downtown. The line, with its station at Alameda and Commercial
streets, provided the city's only service for a decade. In 1873, the
line was turned over to the Southern Pacific to entice the big
railroad to come to Los Angeles. (Banning's station would become a
flag stop for the Southern Pacific; travelers had to flag down the
train to get aboard. That station was torn down in 1888.)</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, 1876, the Golden State's own golden spike connecting
north and south was driven at Lang Station in what is now Santa
Clarita. The Southern Pacific--called "the Espee" for its initials
and immortalized as "The Octopus" for its stranglehold on state
politics in Frank Norris' novel of the same name--finally chugged
into Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   No other single California company ever held the power and
influence that the Southern Pacific did. For more than three decades,
its slightest decision about where to lay tracks and where not to
created some cities and destroyed others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1880, in an area halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco
called Mussel Slough, a dispute over land rights between settlers and
the Southern Pacific erupted into violence, leaving seven men dead.
The brief bullet-punctuated episode became a turning point, as public
outrage swelled against the powerful railroad.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several decades, the SP operated out of three grand
train stations, beginning with the Los Angeles Junction, which
boasted a hotel and dining room in an area known as "the Cornfield,"
bound by Spring Street and North Broadway. In 1888, the SP moved to
the Arcade Station at 5th and Central streets, which was rebuilt on
an adjoining site three decades later and called Central Station.
(Although the SP began making stops at a storefront brick building
called the River Station in Chinatown in 1884, it was only a flag
stop, not one of its three main stations.)</TE>
<TE>   Two more railroads would battle the SP for a foothold in the West,
and each had its own station. In 1891, the Los Angeles Terminal
Railway Station--whose title spawned the name for Terminal
Island--opened on East 1st Street, just east of the Los Angeles
River. After changing its name to the San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt
Lake, it eventually was swallowed up by Union Pacific. When the
station burned down in 1924, Union Pacific moved to Central Station.</TE>
<TE>   The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad also joined the
fray--sometimes literally. More than once, Santa Fe and SP workmen
faced off against each other with rifles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1885, the SP paid the Santa Fe, which had reached San Diego,
$500,000 a year to make San Bernardino its terminus instead of Los
Angeles, to keep competition away. Their pact lasted only two years,
when the Santa Fe acquired a route, becoming the third railroad line
into the city and triggering a half-century-long conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers benefited from vicious fare wars. Thousands of settlers
came to Los Angeles from as far away as Kansas, some on tickets that,
for a few hours in 1887, sold for one dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, the Santa Fe's Moorish-style La Grande Station
opened, between 1st and 2nd streets on Santa Fe Avenue. It had a
first-class restaurant, the Harvey House, which was Judy Garland's
fictional employer in the 1945 MGM movie "The Harvey Girls." Garland
sang: "Do ya hear that whistle down the line? I figure that it's
engine No. 49. She's the only one that'll sound that way. On the
Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe."</TE>
<TE>   Trains were the chief mode of transport for goods and passengers,
bringing their share of glamour to Hollywood. Once in the 1930s,
actress Mae West arrived aboard the Santa Fe's Super Chief.</TE>
<TE>   After posing for photographers, she was met by a handsome deputy
district attorney, who had been sent to escort her by her friend,
Dist. Atty. Buron Fitts. Fitts had ordered the man to give her a big
kiss and say, "This is from Buron"--to which West issued her classic
bawdy rejoinder: "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just glad
to see me?"</TE>
<TE>   A politically connected pimp ran a prostitution business near the
train stations for years. His "girls" took out ads, such as those
that appeared in the "Souvenir Sporting Guide" published in 1897,
colorfully describing prostitutes' services. His lucrative deal ended
in 1913 with the Red Light Abatement Act.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad tracks ran right down Alameda, uneasily coexisting
with trolleys and other vehicles. In 1915, after years of fatal
accidents, several city agencies that were seeking a joint terminal
and a new track location filed a complaint against the three railways
with the California Railroad Commission. The panel intervened,
prompting a decade-long court battle.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the presidents of all three railroads grudgingly agreed
to pay for a terminal, which was named Union Station to symbolize
their reluctant cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   City voters approved the new station in 1926, but it took almost a
decade to agree on the 48-acre site and raze part of Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   On May 3, 1939, half a million people attended the opening of
Union Station, which took six years and $11 million to build.</TE>
<TE>   Opening-day ceremonies culminated in a historical parade featuring
horsemen, muleskinners, stagecoaches, horse-car trolleys and
California's first smoke-belching locomotive, the Southern Pacific's
No. 1 engine of 1869, chugging down the tracks that still ran right
down the street. (However, by then passenger trains no longer used
those rails.)</TE>
<TE>   For three days, crowds streamed through the station, rubbernecking
at its ornate, 52-foot ceilings; its rows of deep, hardwood
waiting-room chairs with leather cushions; its ticket concourse with
30 windows; enormous restrooms; two courtyards with native trees and
plants; and the sumptuous Harvey House restaurant and adjoining bar.
During World War II, the restaurant could feed 800 people an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Critics nicknamed the station's architectural style "mission
moderne." The Spanish heritage was evident in its exterior design.
Architects H.L. Gilman, J.H. Christie and R.J. Wirth created a
Moorish clock tower, high-arched windows and slanted red-tile roofs.
The influence of the consulting architects, the father and son team
of John and Donald Parkinson, was reflected in the many Art Deco
touches.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, 64 passenger trains a day were passing through, bearing
names like the Chief, the Super Chief, the Sunset Limited, the Lark,
the Golden State, the Desert Wind and the City of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout World War II, dramas of tearful departures and joyous
homecomings played out thousands of times a day in Union Station.
Troops came and went around the clock as the number of trains
increased to 100 a day. Lines waiting to board were backed up through
the cavernous waiting room.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Union Station began receiving a tide of refugees.
Thousands of Jews and Central Europeans freed from Nazi concentration
camps poured in on train rides that ended in freedom rather than
death.</TE>
<TE>   Scared and shabbily dressed children with nametags waited in
anticipation for their new adoptive families as volunteers from the
Travelers Aid Society held their hands.</TE>
<TE>   But the glory days were long gone by 1971, when Amtrak took over
passenger operations.</TE>
<TE>   Competition from airlines and cars had reduced the station to an
average of seven passenger trains a day, just as long-distance
trucking had put a dent in railroads' freight business. And the
venerable Harvey House had closed four years before.</TE>
<TE>   But the past proved to be prologue. In recent years, Union Station
has been revived as a dining and shopping mall and as a transit hub.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak, bus lines, the Red Line subway, Metrolink trains, van
pools and taxi and shuttle services converge every day, again
bringing commuters and tourists into the City of Angels.</TE>

<HD>91 Toll-Lane Deal Passes, Goes to Davis</HD>
<DH>Transit: Bill would let Orange County buy express route
from firm and void provision that bars freeway widening. Its fate is
uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question of whether the Orange County Transportation Authority
can buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes was put before Gov. Gray
Davis on Saturday after the state Assembly overwhelmingly passed
legislation allowing the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which appeared in jeopardy last week when two key
legislators pulled their support in a squabble over amendments,
passed 60 to 1 at 1 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   It would allow the OCTA to collect tolls on the express lanes and
nullify a contractual ban on improvements to the Riverside Freeway, a
key step in long-range plans to ease congestion on one of Southern
California's most gridlocked roads.</LD>
<TE>   "We accomplished what a lot of people didn't think we could
accomplish," said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who chairs
the OCTA board. "The governor, with one stroke of his pen, can now
take credit for significant congestion relief for 250,000 daily
motorists."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the legislation aren't taking Davis' approval
for granted. "Once you begin thinking anything up here is a slam
dunk, you're in trouble," said the bill's author, Assemblyman Lou
Correa (D-Anaheim).</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been noncommittal. And like many Democrats in
Sacramento, he is philosophically opposed to toll roads. "As long as
I'm governor, freeways are staying free," he said in March.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Davis echoed that line Saturday. "He's going to
have to read that bill carefully," said press aide Hilary McLean.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis signs the bill, the OCTA could take possession of the
express lanes, which stretch for 10 miles between Anaheim and the
Riverside County line, as early as Jan. 2, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to focus on the positives," the supervisor said. "We have
bipartisan support, bi-county support and statewide support for this
action. The Democrats supported it. If the governor didn't want this
on his desk, he could have killed it in committee."</TE>
<TE>   Three Assembly members from Orange County--Correa, Bill Campbell
and Tom Harman--voted for AB 1010. But three did not vote: John
Campbell, Ken Maddox and Patricia Bates.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people still had questions about the appraisal" for the
sale, Correa said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people still had questions about the commitment for future
construction and improvements on the road. There were a lot of
legislators who had differences of opinion over tweaks to the
legislation. But even they recognized the common goal, which is to
ease traffic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA has offered $207.5 million for the lanes, which were
built in the mid-1990s for about $135 million and are owned by
California Private Transportation Co. The sale would allow the OCTA
to negate a non-compete agreement the company has with the California
Department of Transportation that prevents widening of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Each workday, about 250,000 cars squeeze through the artery that
connects Orange County and the Inland Empire--a number expected to
hit 400,000 by 2010.</TE>

<HD>Videos Are Weapons in Surf City Feud</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Huntington condo residents record their frequent
run-ins on tape. Police are called almost daily but find peace
elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started a year ago with complaints at the Harbour Vista
condominium complex that a man was taking up too many parking spaces.</LD>
<LD>   Then one resident's car was towed. Another had his car's tires
slashed and motor oil dumped at his doorstep.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the quiet Huntington Beach development crackles with the
tension of a battlefield--and it's all caught on tape. Police are
called to the complex almost daily--nearly 150 visits since
January--to break up shouting matches.</LD>
<TE>   Homeowners have sought temporary restraining orders against each
other. A few have simply moved out. The situation has become so
disruptive that real estate agents must disclose the neighborhood
battles to potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   What set this feud apart is the weapon of choice: video cameras.
The man at the center of the dispute has 15 cameras mounted inside
his windows to record everything that moves outside his home. He
carries a minicam and still camera around the complex whenever he
leaves his home, frightening neighbors--and their children--who
resent being videotaped.</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors have retaliated with their own video recordings,
creating lens-to-lens showdowns in the condo common spaces peppered
with cursing and shouting. There is now a library of
videotapes--evidence that both sides use to show they are in the
right.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't focus on being normal individuals living in a
community," said William McCord, the beleaguered president of the
homeowners association. "Never in my wildest dreams would I think
that I would have to spend 10 to 15 hours a week on this. I don't
sleep anymore. It's killing my wife."</TE>
<TE>   It's not illegal to videotape people in public, so authorities
said they are powerless to resolve the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically you have a group of people not getting along, and
they're doing everything they can to irritate each other," said
Huntington Beach Police Lt. J.B. Hume. "The videos we have seen have
been taken to the D.A.'s office, and it was determined that no crime
has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Rogers had four cars. But he's entitled to use only two
spaces in his condo complex's parking lot. It's been a touchy subject
with neighbors ever since the 37-year-old man and his mother moved in
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the condominium association board confronted Rogers
about the problem. Rogers complained he was being singled out and
accused neighbors of frequently parking illegally.</TE>
<TE>   The board responded by ordering another neighbor's car towed away.
A few days later, Rogers walked outside and noticed that someone had
dumped motor oil on his doorstep and slashed his tires.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents left Rogers feeling afraid and alone. And they were
brutal reminders of the violence that brought him and his mother to
Harbour Vista. Rogers moved into the complex after a man who had been
staying with the two stabbed Mary Rogers and slashed his throat,
leaving him for dead.</TE>
<TE>   Permanently disabled and unable to work, Rogers hoped to start a
new life--and vowed not to become a victim again. So, once trouble
started with the neighbors, he looked for a way to document what was
happening.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, neighbors noticed Rogers walking around the complex aiming a
video camera at them or snapping photographs. Eventually he installed
a network of small video cameras inside his windows.</TE>
<TE>   "The videotape became a tool of trying to say, 'Stop it, because
I'm documenting this,' " Rogers said. "I'd be dead without it."</TE>
<TE>   His next-door neighbor, Michael Richardson, a 38-year-old
warehouse worker, believed Rogers was targeting his family,
videotaping him and his young daughters as they left their house.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents began complaining that Rogers taped their children
walking to school, getting off the school bus and playing around the
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Some suggested that Rogers was using the videotapes for illicit
purposes. Richardson said he posted a sign in the complex accusing
Rogers of being a pedophile.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they looked into that accusation but found no evidence
of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   As the months wore on, the exchanges became increasingly bitter
and involved more than a dozen families. Richardson and other
neighbors began recording Rogers recording them.</TE>
<TE>   Videotapes shot by Rogers show residents shooing him away, yelling
"Get out of here, John." Videotapes shot by other residents show
Rogers recording their activities in common areas, yelling "Get away
from me" as they approach.</TE>
<TE>   Other videotapes show a ritual between Rogers and Richardson in
which they take turns shouting at each other through the security
gates of their condos. They also shine powerful flashlights at each
other's windows throughout the night. Rogers and Richardson received
temporary restraining orders requiring them to stay 100 yards from
each other. But the order is difficult to enforce because they live
only a few feet apart.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors took sides, with many faulting Rogers. Mark Rasmussen
became so angry at the constant videotaping of his 2-year-old
daughter that he started recording Rogers during his visits to the
pool.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show some evidence that he hangs out at the pool with
no intention to go swimming," the homeowner said. But after a while,
Rasmussen put away his recorder. "He outlasted me," he said. "He's a
pro."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Ana McGann and her 13-year-old son sided with Rogers,
saying their neighbor has been unfairly ostracized.</TE>
<TE>   She feels sympathy for Rogers' past and says she can understand
his need to use his cameras as a shield.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these people need to sit back and realize that they are
dealing with a human being, not a piece of trash," said McGann, 36,
adding that her friendship with Rogers has prompted others at Harbour
Vista to give her the cold shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   As homeowners association president, McCord felt compelled to
defuse the situation.</TE>
<TE>   He tried talking to Rogers, then issued several citations, but to
no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "We got 30 neighbors together in a clubhouse with John," McCord
said, "but it's beyond us. We don't know what to do any longer."</TE>
<TE>   The association offered to pay Rogers' moving expenses if he sold
his condo, but the deal fell through.</TE>
<TE>   During one confrontation, Rogers placed McCord under citizen's
arrest, though police took no action against him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police have logged more than 200 phone calls from Harbour Vista
residents since January and sent officers to the complex 144 times.</TE>
<TE>   The department estimates it has logged 432 hours of staff time
dealing with the dispute. The calls have ranged from complaints about
water-gun attacks to threats to harm a neighbor's dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt this problem is taking up far more resources than
any other problem area" in the city, Hume said. "We have tried
mediation, investigation, consultations. We've done everything we can
to bring peace to the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   On March 14, police made their only arrest at Harbour Vista.
Richardson was taken into custody for threatening Rogers. The charges
were reduced to a misdemeanor, and Richardson paid a fine.</TE>
<TE>   Police have reviewed stacks of videotapes from all sides but found
no evidence of crimes. They say the verbal exchanges don't warrant
police action.</TE>
<TE>   "What gets me is they don't see themselves as being part of it. It
takes two to tango," Hume said. "If you want to call them victims,
both of them have been victimized by each other."</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors could not take it anymore. Tiffany Decker and her
husband, Jay, decided to sell their two-bedroom unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just real frustrating to have to come home and run into
[Rogers]," Tiffany Decker said. "You park your car and he
automatically comes out with his video camera. Every night and every
day the cops were there. I can't live like that."</TE>
<TE>   One other homeowner also sold, and another has placed his home on
the market.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that potential buyers be told of potential
nuisances, and as one Huntington Beach real estate agent put it,
"When you start seeing police cars, then you know you need to start
disclosing it."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Rogers filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
against 13 residents at the complex, accusing them of harassment. He
hopes to collect enough to move out of Harbour Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Richardson family last week won civil judgments
against Rogers totaling $13,000.</TE>
<TE>   The family argued in court that Rogers had harassed them with the
video cameras. Rogers says he will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still making attempts to mediate and to improve things,"
Hume said, adding he still worries the situation will escalate. "It
could go from name-calling to actual violence."</TE>

<HD>Officers Find Abducted Girl, Mother at a Rest Stop in San
Diego County</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine-year-old Cierra Walden, who was abducted by her mentally
disturbed mother from a foster care facility on Wednesday, was
recovered Saturday in San Diego County by California Highway Patrol
officers acting on an Amber alert tip.</LD>
<LD>   According to a CHP spokesman, Steve Lopez, two men, one of them an
off-duty corrections officer, spotted a blue Hyundai Accent about 8
a.m. at the Buckman Springs Rest Stop on Interstate 8.</LD>
<LD>   The car matched the description of the one listed on the Amber
alert that the men, who were on a boating trip, had seen on an
activated board in Chula Vista, about an hour west of the rest stop.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez said that the men could see that a woman and a girl were in
the car. They tried to make contact with the mother, Pamela Rose
Walden, Lopez said, and when they saw that she was upset, they used
their pickup truck and its boat trailer to block the Hyundai.</TE>
<TE>   The men called 911 on a cell phone, Lopez said. A CHP officer who
arrived a few minutes later arrested Walden without incident and
recovered Cierra and her white poodle.</TE>
<TE>   Cierra "is doing fine" Lopez said Saturday afternoon. "She had
breakfast, she watched TV, and now she's coloring."</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Walden, 50, apparently abducted Cierra from a foster care
facility in Madera after telling health officials she was
communicating with God through a computer chip placed in the girl's
head. The mother also insisted that someone was trying to kill the
girl and to blame Walden.</TE>
<TE>   Friday evening, truckers who had seen the Amber alert about Cierra
on roadside signs spotted the Hyundai and tried to surround it. But
Walden got away.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield police said they were sending detectives to San Diego
to retrieve the girl and her mother separately. Pamela Walden will be
booked into the Kern County Jail. Cierra was in protective custody in
Kern County, police said.</TE>

<HD>Pulling Plug on State's Power Buying</HD>
<DH>Energy: Department of Water Resources plans to stop
purchasing electricity Jan. 1 and let utilities resume the task.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Once compared by Gov. Gray Davis to a stickball team playing the
Yankees, the electricity buyers at the Department of Water Resources
have reason these days to feel like long-shot victors.</LD>
<LD>   Pitted 19 months ago against such energy industry giants as Enron,
Dynegy and Williams, the state's hastily assembled team initially
paid prices comparable to a $15 gallon of gasoline and struggled to
avoid blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the state power buyers snap up bargains. In a July heat
wave, they had power to sell. Many of the companies that last year
gloated over easy profits in California are today bankrupt or nearly
so.</LD>
<TE>   But the state's pinch-hitting role is nearly finished. DWR's
emergency authority to buy electricity expires at the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   When desperate lawmakers shoved the water agency into the job of
buying electricity for 27 million people, they figured that by Jan.
1, 2003, the crisis would be ended and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric could resume
their old duties.</TE>
<TE>   The smallest of the three utilities, SDG&amp;E, is financially healthy
enough to buy electricity again. But PG&amp;E is in bankruptcy, and
Edison's debt for past energy purchases tops $1 billion. Utility
officials say they nonetheless hope to take the reins from DWR at the
turn of the new year.</TE>
<TE>   They don't have much choice. The Legislature has made no effort to
extend the state's authority to buy electricity. The governor, who
could issue an executive order to accomplish the same thing, said he
has no intention of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor made clear that this was a short-term solution,"
said Richard Katz, an energy advisor to the governor. "The
handwriting's on the wall. The DWR is getting out of this business at
the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, the Public Utilities Commission and the
Legislature have taken steps to prepare for the shift.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has begun giving the utilities responsibility for
dispatching electricity under 35 long-term power contracts signed by
DWR in the spring of 2001. DWR will keep the legal title to the
contracts, but each utility will get responsibility for scheduling
the electricity produced or delivered under contract in its service
area.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the PUC also gave the utilities what amounts to
power-buying training wheels. The commission passed an order allowing
PG&amp;E and Edison to sign their own power contracts, lasting up to five
years, with DWR co-signing the agreements. That financial backing
from DWR would fall away whenever the utilities are financially
healthy enough to win a thumbs-up from Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities won't need to sign many more contracts. Existing DWR
contracts, negotiated in a rush in the spring of 2001 to help the
state avoid exorbitant spot-market prices, supply most of what the
utilities will need for their customers over the next several years.
At times, the contracts leave DWR with a surplus of power that must
be sold at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some months or hours when we need power," said Edison
Senior Vice President John Fielder, "but we're not buying a whole
lot."</TE>
<TE>   More important to returning the utilities to the power-buying
business is a bill that has cleared the Legislature and is expected
to get the governor's signature.</TE>
<TE>   AB 57, by Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los Angeles), would restrict
the PUC's control over electricity rates. It would automatically
trigger rate hikes if the utilities sank into debt beyond a certain
threshold, which for Edison is roughly $280 million. Conversely, if
costs fell, the customers of Edison and PG&amp;E would get a rate cut.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has proved to be too fickle for lenders, Wright said. "In
the PUC, you have five people who can make decisions about
financing," he said, "and they can almost turn on a dime. Financial
markets are afraid of that."</TE>
<TE>   Fielder said such a law should reassure Wall Street credit-rating
agencies that the utilities can be trusted to pay their bills.
Getting back into the good graces of investors is critical, they say.
Without an investment-grade rating, the utilities must keep millions
of dollars sitting around as collateral and pay higher costs to
sellers fearful of not getting paid.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities fell billions of dollars into debt during a 13-month
reign of high power prices in the market that California created
under a deregulation plan. A rate freeze imposed by lawmakers barred
the utilities from recovering their costs from customers.</TE>
<TE>   Edison dodged bankruptcy by striking a federal court settlement
with the PUC last October. Under that plan, shareholders and utility
customers will split responsibility for paying off the utility's
approximately $3.3-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E took a different path and filed for bankruptcy in April 2001.
The San Francisco company must clear more hurdles than Edison to
reach investment-grade status. In hearings scheduled for November, a
federal bankruptcy judge is expected to weigh PG&amp;E's plan for paying
off creditors against one devised by the PUC and endorsed by those
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E officials say they believe the Bankruptcy Court could finish
its work before the end of the year. The company must be out of
bankruptcy and get an investment-grade rating before it can resume
buying power, they say.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say that isn't so. Even in bankruptcy, PG&amp;E can
buy and sell electricity so long as it keeps a pile of cash as
collateral with the agency that manages most of California's
transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Enron Corp., the once mighty Houston energy trader that
filed for bankruptcy in December. To continue selling electricity in
California, it posted with the Independent System Operator enough
money to cover three days' worth of electricity for its customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe the utilities have to be investment-grade. They
have to be creditworthy, which is not the same thing," said Barry
Goode, the governor's legal advisor.</TE>
<TE>   With four months to go, the utilities are rebuilding their ranks
of energy traders. They've already lured away three of the dozen
power buyers at DWR.</TE>
<TE>   And in a sign of how control of California's power market has
turned topsy-turvy in the past year, energy traders with the once
high-flying private companies have shown up at DWR's power-buying
headquarters in suburban Sacramento, looking for work.</TE>
<TE>   DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said a trader with Mirant Corp. in
Atlanta showed up two weeks ago, hoping to get DWR experience for his
resume, however brief.</TE>
<TE>   "The word is out that things are clicking here," Hidalgo said.</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Lose Game, Maybe Martinez Too</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Damon picked the worst possible time to make his first error
in 250 games.</LD>
<LD>   Damon misplayed a ball in the ninth inning that allowed Bill Selby
to score from first on Omar Vizquel's double, giving the Cleveland
Indians an 8-7 win over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night at
Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   The loss accompanied the news that a strained left hip could force
Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez to miss his scheduled start Tuesday at
Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez did not fly with the team to Cleveland on Friday. He
instead stayed in Boston to be examined by team physician Bill Morgan
and have a precautionary MRI test done.</TE>
<TE>   "He's scheduled to start on Tuesday and right now we're unsure
about that," manager Grady Little said. "We'll see him again [in New
York] and check it out."</TE>
<TE>   Little said he suspects that Martinez sustained the injury
Wednesday in the late innings of his start against the Yankees, in
which he walked a season-high four batters and took the loss.
Martinez threw 127 pitches in the game, the most he's thrown since
May of last year. Little said he didn't regret letting Martinez throw
so much.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing wrong with his arm," Little said. "His arm still
feels great."</TE>
<TE>   Damon didn't feel good about his miscue, which ended Boston's bid
at a comeback from a 6-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the time to make it," Damon said.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, Selby hit a pinch single. Milton
Bradley popped up a bunt to first baseman Brian Daubach before
Vizquel's hit off Bobby Howry (3-4).</TE>
<TE>   Damon went to his right to cut off the ball and it bounced off his
glove. He threw to cutoff man Nomar Garciaparra, who made a strong
throw to the plate, but Jason Varitek couldn't come up with the
one-hop throw as Selby slid in headfirst.</TE>
<TE>   Damon had not committed an error in 592 total chances--an American
League record. His last error was on Aug. 27, 2000. It came against
Boston when he was with the Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Seattle 2--Kit Pellow hit a tiebreaking RBI single
off closer Kazuhiro Sasaki with two out in the ninth inning to lead
the Royals at Seattle. With two out, Neifi Perez drew a walk from
Arthur Rhodes (7-3) and Luis Ordaz singled. Sasaki replaced Rhodes
and gave up a single to Pellow, scoring Perez from second. Carlos
Beltran followed with an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 32
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners tied the score at 2-2 with two out in the eighth when
Carlos Guillen hit his ninth homer.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, New York 1--Justin Miller, Cliff Politte and Kelvim
Escobar combined on a three-hitter as the Blue Jays won at Toronto.
Miller, facing the Yankees for the first time, only gave up Derek
Jeter's single to left in the first, Raul Mondesi's bloop double to
center in the fifth and John Vander Wal's infield single in the
fifth. Josh Phelps hit an RBI triple in the fifth for his 30th RBI of
the month, the most RBIs in a month by an American League rookie
since the Angels' Garret Anderson had 31 in July 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Detroit 4--Joe Crede hit his fourth home run in as many
games, capping a five-run first for the White Sox at Detroit. It was
Chicago's sixth victory in eight games and Detroit's third loss in a
row. Crede has 13 RBIs in his last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 7, Texas 5--Randy Winn scored the go-ahead run on a wild
pitch in the eighth as the Devil Rays won at Arlington, Texas.</TE>

<LD>Lisa Leslie and Mwadi Mabika of the Sparks were named to the All-WNBA
first team Saturday. Also voted onto the first team were Seattle's
Sue Bird, Indiana's Tamika Catchings and Houston's Sheryl Swoopes.</LD>
<LD>   Voted to the second team were Chamique Holdsclaw of Washington,
Tina Thompson of Houston, Tari Phillips of New York, Shannon Johnson
of Orlando and Katie Smith of Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams were introduced before Game 2 of the WNBA Finals
between the Sparks and the New York Liberty at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth selection for Leslie, the first for Mabika. It
is the first time two rookies--Catchings and Bird--were named to the
first team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy," said Mabika, who averaged a career-high 16.8
points. "I'm grateful people recognized I can play. I put a lot of

<TE>   Leslie, who averaged 16.9 points, became the first WNBA player to
dunk in a game and went over 3,000 career points.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of her," Leslie said of Mabika. "She's the real
deal; not only did she score, she made big shots to win games."</TE>
<TE>   First-team honorees were presented $10,000, and second-team
selections received $5,000.</TE>

<HD>Winning Ways Continue for A's</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Lidle's string ends, but team's streak doesn't as
A's beat Twins for 17th consecutive win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The only thing missing from the Oakland Athletics' 17th consecutive
victory was a win for Cory Lidle.</LD>
<LD>   Lidle's masterful month came to an end Saturday when he gave up
his first earned run in August on the month's final day, but the A's
got enough late offense to defeat the Minnesota Twins, 6-3, and
extend the majors' longest winning streak in 49 years.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Chavez hit a tiebreaking two-run single in the eighth inning
and finished with four RBIs for the A's, who have the longest winning
streak since the 1953 New York Yankees won 18 in a row. Oakland's 17
consecutive wins matched a franchise record set by the 1931
Philadelphia A's.</LD>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," Lidle said. "I don't care if you're an
All-Star team, if someone says you're going to win 17 in a row you
don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   One might have had a hard time imagining a pitcher going 43
innings without an earned run, too.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Lidle did, but another solid start was wasted. Lidle
left with one out in the eighth carrying a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   It only slightly dampened the accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "Just enjoy the ride," Manager Art Howe said of the streak. "These
guys find a way to win every night. Cory Lidle was the story tonight
and the only drawback to the win was that he didn't get the win."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Dustan Mohr hit a pinch-hit home run in the eighth and
Torii Hunter tied the game with a run-scoring single off Jim Mecir
later in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who homered in the seventh and had three hits, came up
with the bases loaded after Minnesota reliever J.C. Romero (8-2)
intentionally walked Miguel Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez shattered his bat on Romero's first pitch, but the ball got
past Luis Rivas into center field, scoring two runs.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch worked the ninth for his career-high 37th save in 42
opportunities. Koch's 11 saves in August set an Oakland record.</TE>

<HD>Angels Get to Enjoy Hit Parade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels honored Brian Downing on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   And then they emulated him.</LD>
<LD>   On the night they gave out bobblehead dolls of Downing, the
franchise's leader with 1,588 hits, the Angels used their own bats to
smash 16 hits, including a record-tying seven in a row, in a 9-0
victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   Angel right-hander Ramon Ortiz (11-9) quieted the Oriole bats by
pitching a five-hitter for the first shutout of his career.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a bobblehead awarded for this night, it would go to
outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, who tied his all-time best with four
hits and drove in three runs. Catcher Bengie Molina contributed a
three-run homer and second baseman Adam Kennedy hit a two-run shot.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is not built around the home run," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "We execute well, we put runners in motion and we have
a lot of depth. When our No. 9 hitter [Kennedy] is hitting [.319] and
our No. 8 hitter hits a three-run homer, it shows the contributions
that are being made from all angles of this lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all their efforts, the Angels once again found themselves
running in place in terms of the division race. The victory was the
team's third straight and fourth in its last five games, but that
pales in comparison to the AL West-leading Oakland Athletics, who won
their 17th straight Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels again failed to move upward, they added to their
wild-card lead Saturday as the Seattle Mariners lost to the Kansas
City Royals to drop 2 1/2 games behind the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   First the Angels teed off on Baltimore starter and loser Scott
Erickson (5-12) Saturday, getting the seven straight hits off him in
the second inning, leading to six runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have gotten seven straight hits three other times, all
three coming against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   This time, first baseman Scott Spiezio began the barrage with a
line drive that ricocheted off the glove of second baseman Jerry
Hairston. Brad Fullmer followed with a single.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on a 3-2 count, Molina hit a fly ball down the left-field
line that just made it into the hands of the fans a few rows back and
a few rows on the fair side of the foul pole. It was Molina's third
home run of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson had taken the mound 16-6 lifetime against the Angels, but
he also began with a 5.25 overall earned-run average this season, and
that proved to be the more accurate indicator of how things would go
this night.</TE>
<TE>   Left in after Molina's homer, Erickson gave up singles in
succession to Kennedy, David Eckstein and Darin Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Still there was no hook from Manager Mike Hargrove.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after Palmeiro doubled to the wall in right-center,
driving in three more runs, Hargrove mercifully took the ball from
his battered right-hander.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels weren't done yet.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, Erstad and Palmeiro hit three consecutive singles in the
fourth inning off reliever Chris Brock to load the bases and Garret
Anderson followed with a sacrifice fly to center. It was Anderson's
100th RBI, the third straight season he has reached that milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the guy we want to set the table for," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning, with Molina aboard on a walk, Kennedy hit his
fourth home run of the year into the right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   While the outcome seemed a foregone conclusion by then, there was
still plenty of drama because Ortiz was mowing down batter after
batter without even the threat of a hit.</TE>
<TE>   He retired the first 16 before catcher Geronimo Gil hit a soft
liner that dropped fair in right field, eliciting a collective groan
from the crowd of 38,563.</TE>
<TE>   For the only time all night, Ortiz seemed to lose his
concentration, giving up singles to Hairston and Melvin Mora to load
the bases.</TE>
<TE>   But Ortiz regained the touch, striking out Luis Lopez and retiring
Chris Richard on a fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He was aggressive. He went after the hitters," said Scioscia.
"What a great ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Even in statistic-crazy baseball, no numbers are kept on the
number of times a pitcher goes to his cap, his shirt, moves back and
forth on the mound. But Ortiz knows that the less he does that sort
of thing, the faster he pitches, the more he maintains his rhythm,
the better the results.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, he maintained a smooth rhythm throughout except for that
sixth inning.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Teams can expand their rosters to 40 men today, and the Angels plan
to activate left-hander Dennis Cook and outfielder Julio Ramirez from
the disabled list and recall left-hander Mark Lukasiewicz from their
triple-A Salt City Lake farm team, where he was 3-2 with a 3.98
earned-run average. Lukasiewicz also appeared in 14 games with the
Angels this year, going 1-0 with a 3.48 ERA.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez has missed 69 games because of a strained left calf, Cook
51 games because of a torn rotator cuff.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   It may not have been the best way to make a point, but there was a
point to be made.</TE>
<TE>   That was the consensus of a small group of fans in the field boxes
at Edison Field on Saturday night who were questioned about the
Thursday night uprising.</TE>
<TE>   None felt their fellow fans were justified in throwing objects
onto the field during a game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in
order to protest the possible strike that loomed just hours ahead.
Yet all said they understood and shared the feelings of frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a great way of protesting," said Monica Aquino
of Riverside. "The players have played all year and now, when it's so
exciting, they were going to go on strike. I thought they were acting
like babies, like brats."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ewell Gunter of Santa Ana, "It's never right to do something
like that, but you have to understand, the fans are never
consulted.... It is never right to do evil, but it's the fans who pay
the salaries. You've got to take care of the ones who got you here."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Nakamura, from Mission Viejo, thought the throwing of
everything from bottles to toilet paper was excessive.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought throwing back the foul balls was enough of a statement,
" he said. "I understand. I was frustrated myself."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Milauskas of Palm Springs was impressed with the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ironic that the only place in baseball this would happen
was Anaheim," Milauskas said. "I'm surprised people knew what was
going on with the strike. Everybody here is so laid back, they don't
usually do anything unless the scoreboard tells them to do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Scott Schoeneweis was booed when he came into Friday's
game because of his comments criticizing the debris-throwing fans. He
later amended those comments to say he meant only "some" fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they got it out of their system," said Schoeneweis, a
converted starter who picked up his first save Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I do something bad first on the field to get booed."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Labor Reflections, or:</LD>
<LD>   Standing All Night In The Rain Waiting For Negotiators To Come Out
Of The Major League Baseball Offices And Say "No Comment" Isn't My
Vision Of The Great White Way....</LD>
<LD>   *  The new revenue sharing and payroll tax provisions of the
bargaining agreement are designed to help bring the New York Yankees
back to the pack, but it figures to be business as usual for George
Steinbrenner's team.</LD>
<TE>   The Yankees will have to pay between $50 and $60 million in tax
and revenue sharing next year, almost double their 2002 obligation,
but that's not the $81 million bite projected in management's initial
proposal, which had the Boss thinking of suing his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a Yankee official said Saturday, "we'll just have to go about
it a little more cautiously."</TE>
<TE>   The first test will come in the off-season when Robin Ventura,
Mike Stanton and Ramiro Mendoza are eligible for free agency, and
Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens can leave through contract
provisions. Pettitte has an $11.5-million option, and Clemens has a
$10.3-million option that has to be paid even if he doesn't pitch for
the Yankees. Both have experienced injury-marred seasons,
complicating the decision for the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "George's life is all about bringing a winner to the fans of New
York," the club official said. "That's not going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, an expanding cable network should enhance the current
revenue of $242 million.</TE>
<TE>   As Ventura told New York reporters asking about the Yankees'
obligation under the new agreement: "I'm sure this might cause George
not to do some things, but I'm also sure there's a certain point
where he'll just do whatever he wants."</TE>
<TE>   *  Much like the Yankees, whose ability to sign players at any
cost it diligently tried to protect during the negotiations, the
players' union expects business to continue as usual.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the union made some modest concessions, but the new agreement
shouldn't hinder the salary market as much as the financial retreat
by many of the previously big spenders. The general perception in
baseball is that a lesson has been learned and it will be rare now
that a player gets a contract of $15 million a year or more.</TE>
<TE>   Still, union leader Don Fehr knows he didn't give away a lot in
the bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a subject we're sensitive to," Fehr said when asked if he
was concerned that the new agreement delivered too big a hit on the
Yankees and other heavy hitters. "This is an agreement we can live
with. Otherwise, we wouldn't have made it."</TE>
<TE>   *  One of the reasons the deal got done, perhaps, is that Fehr
didn't take much more of a role at the table than Commissioner Bud
Selig did.</TE>
<TE>   The union leader loves to lecture on bargaining history, in
baseball and otherwise, and isn't timid about lecturing his
adversaries. He'll do it at the drop of a proposal, as he did
Thursday night, nearly imploding the whole deal, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   The management team was so angry, according to the source, that
Selig gave his lead lawyer, Rob Manfred, permission to tell Fehr to
stick it, but Manfred knew he had a larger job to do.</TE>
<TE>   The source said the sides sat silently staring at each other for a
nervous minute or two before resuming discussions, with union lawyers
Steve Fehr, the less volatile brother, and Michael Weiner, the
possible heir to the union throne, continuing to play the calming and
key roles.</TE>
<TE>   Said a management official: "Don sometimes thinks he's Samuel
Gompers at the start of the labor movement. He forgets that we've all
been to school, we all know the story."</TE>
<TE>   *  With all of that, officials on both sides Saturday were
crediting a Friday morning meeting between Fehr and Selig for
clearing the air and clearing the way for the final settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "With the clock ticking," union council Gene Orza said, "that was
going to be a make-or-break meeting. If that meeting had ended
poorly, it seemed to me there would have been a breakdown and each
party would have done what they had to do."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Orza said, it was only 10 minutes later that Selig and
Fehr were being joined by Manfred and Bob DuPuy on the owners' side
and Weiner and Steve Fehr on the players' side, and the final
trade-offs ensued.</TE>
<TE>   "It was strictly workmanlike," Orza said. "There was no dramatic
'OK, OK, I give up' from either side.</TE>
<TE>   "For everything either side gave up, they got something back."</TE>
<TE>   And, Orza said, it is the nature of bargaining that it went down
to the wire.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly, he might have added, when years of bad bargaining
had created massive mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   "Why wouldn't it come down to the last minute?" he said. "Why
should the clubs believe anything we say until they're facing the
threat of a strike, and why should the players believe anything they
say until the players are faced with a decision of having to go on
strike?"</TE>
<TE>   *  The format of the worldwide draft still has to be negotiated,
but one of the final trade-offs involved the June selections and
reflects the rising risk and cost of signing the top amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   The owners gave up a provision that forced clubs signing top free
agents to forfeit their top amateur draft picks as compensation.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, they obtained the right to receive additional
selections if they fail to sign their first-and second-round choices.</TE>
<TE>   *  Several items disappeared during the bargaining, including
Selig's $100,000 discretionary fund. Well, it didn't disappear
entirely, but it was reduced to a $10,000 fund. Selig can use it for
any purpose he wants, but $10,000 won't go far.</TE>
<TE>   Do you suppose that, despite the settlement and display of
positive vibes, the fact that $100,000 turned into $10,000 is a
lingering reflection of the union's mistrust of the commissioner?</TE>
<TE>   *  So, who gets the tax proceeds?</TE>
<TE>   That's still being worked on, but Orza said the money is likely to
be spent on player benefits or growing the game.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be an overdue gesture, as the march of time continues
to claim the last of the 75 or so pre-1946 players, for baseball to
finally fund pensions for them?</TE>
<TE>   Their repeated requests to be included in one pension or another
keep getting rejected by the union and baseball, but if those two
antagonists can settle without a work stoppage, maybe a pension for
those players is possible as well.</TE>

<LD>First the news, then the views....</LD>
<LD>   News: The Oakland Athletics reeled off 16 consecutive victories
beginning play Saturday, matching the major leagues' longest streak
in 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Views: See what outstanding pitching produces.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Billy Beane, considered one of baseball's
shrewdest executives, built the Athletics on a foundation of
phenomenal young starters, enabling the small-market club to compete
with deep-pocket teams.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing first baseman Jason Giambi (New York Yankees),
center fielder Johnny Damon (Boston Red Sox) and closer Jason
Isringhausen (St. Louis Cardinals) in free agency, Oakland leads the
AL West behind the terrific trio of left-handers Barry Zito, 24, and
Mark Mulder, 25, and right-hander Tim Hudson, 27.</TE>
<TE>   Zito has emerged as the group's ace of the moment in only his
second full season. The former USC All-American is 19-5 with a 2.83
earned-run average, including 8-2 with a 1.69 ERA in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   After leading the staff with 21 victories last season, Mulder is
16-7 with a 3.77 ERA. Hudson, a 20-game winner in 2000, is 12-9 with
a 3.22 ERA. He was 5-0 with a 1.80 ERA in August.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson and Mulder are signed through 2005 and 2006, respectively,
and Zito cannot become a free agent until after the 2006 season.</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Miguel Tejada and Gold Glove third baseman Eric Chavez
also are rising young stars, but the Athletics are still powered by
pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "With our starting pitching, no matter what else happens, we feel
we always have a chance," Beane said. "We have lost some significant
players here in the last year, including an MVP candidate [Giambi],
arguably one of the premier leadoff hitters in the game in Damon and
a closer who's probably going to save 40 games. Do we ever wonder
about what could have been? Yeah, we do for about 60 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "But then, instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we determine
what our options are and we move on. We actually start thinking about
our options long before the day of reckoning comes. We have to
because we realize that, more often than not, when it comes to
finances, we must be prepared and we have to be somewhat creative.
But our pitching definitely makes it a little easier."</TE>
<TE>   News: The hot San Francisco Giants put pressure on the Dodgers in
the NL wild-card race, setting the stage for a classic September
showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Views: What could be better than the Dodgers and Giants battling
for a playoff spot with the finish line in sight?</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent don't like each other much, but they've
pulled together on the field. It's still seemingly Shawn Green or
bust for the Dodgers, and the All-Star right fielder might not have
enough left to carry them.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs meet in a three-game series at Pacific Bell Park,
beginning Sept. 9, and play four games from Sept. 16-19 at Dodger
Stadium. Missing the playoffs after an outstanding start would be a
huge letdown for the Dodgers and their fans, making the winter
especially chilly at Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   News: Owners rebuffed in their attempts to implement a minimum
$45-million payroll, which the union considered to be another
restraint on salaries, in the new labor contract approved Friday, and
management in turn shot down the union's proposal to participate in
monitoring how clubs spend their revenue-sharing money.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The battle lines are already drawn for the next labor war
in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The union scoffed at owners' payroll-floor proposal, considering
almost every team was already above that level this season, but that
won't dissuade owners from pushing for hard payroll floors and
ceilings in the next collective bargaining process.</TE>
<TE>   The union and some big-market executives (see Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner) are concerned that small-market clubs will simply
pocket their bigger slices of the increased revenue-sharing pie.</TE>
<TE>   "We had proposed a minimum payroll," said Robert DuPuy, baseball's
chief operating officer. "But given the levels of increased revenue
sharing, and given the goal of attaining a higher level of
competitive balance, we believe the clubs will definitely use that
revenue the way it was intended, which is to help them become more
competitive."</TE>
<TE>   The union, by no means convinced, will be watching closely.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from history of past collective bargaining, where [a
similar] system of revenue sharing was in effect, that there was no
increase in player payroll [of low-revenue clubs]," agent Scott Boras
said. "I don't believe this is going to have any measurable effect on
the competitiveness of the clubs that are receiving the money."</TE>
<TE>   News: Atlanta starter Greg Maddux, who has only five victories in
17 starts since June 5, might not win 15 games for the first time in
15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It has been a strange season for the four-time Cy Young
Award winner, slowed by injuries but still leading the NL with a 2.56
ERA. Maddux could make as many as seven more starts, and with four
more victories would match Young's record of 15 consecutive
15-victory seasons. Young's streak ran from 1891 through 1905, and
Maddux's began in 1988, his first full season in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm pitching better than it looks on paper," the
268-game winner said. "Have I pitched good? Not as good as I would
have liked to, obviously.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made some mistakes that I shouldn't be making. But I think,
at the same time, I've made enough good pitches to get by."</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander has a salary of $12.5 million in the final year
of a five-year, $57.5-million contract. Left-hander Tom Glavine--a
two-time Cy Young award winner--also can become a free agent after
the season, and the Braves are not expected to re-sign both.</TE>

<LD>Marshall Coach Bobby Pruett has worn the same pair of shoes to
football practice every day.</LD>
<LD>   For going on nine years.</LD>
<LD>   That's because those shoes are 91-14 since he got them in 1994 as
an assistant coach at Florida. They're 69-11 at Marshall.</LD>
<TE>   "Hard to get them off me now, you know what I'm saying?" Pruett
said. The coach even has a special way of talking about his favorite
footwear.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not 'The Shoes,' " he said. "They're not even 'THE
Shoes.' They're 'THUH Shoes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Pruett has given equipment managers the responsibility of keeping
the tattered things wearable. They've had to use glue, tape, needle
and thread.</TE>
<TE>   "Every equipment guy I've had has glued them up," Pruett said.
"That's part of his responsibilities. If they come in and say, 'We
can't do it,' I say, 'Yeah, you can too. Or we'll find a new
equipment manager.'</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, those are 'Thuh Shoes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are Aubrey Huff and Felix Escalona?</TE>
<TE>   Check your contract: You've heard about them before, the
outrageous clauses that appear in athletes' contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Raef LaFrentz of the Dallas Mavericks has one you might not have
encountered.</TE>
<TE>   No dueling.</TE>
<TE>   "Dueling? You mean like with swords? I can guarantee that I won't
be dueling," LaFrentz told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   LaFrentz agreed to other clauses that say he won't get paid if he
is injured while boxing, riding a motorcycle or deliberately exposing
himself to extreme danger, except to save a life.</TE>
<TE>   The old ballpark: The problem with quaint old ballparks is ...
they're old ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   An engraving above the main grandstand at Luther Williams Field in
Macon, Ga., reads, "Macon Base Ball Park," a link to a time when the
game was a lot younger.</TE>
<TE>   Kenesaw Mountain Landis threw out the first pitch 73 years ago.
Jackie Robinson, Ted Williams, Pete Rose and Chipper Jones made stops
too.</TE>
<TE>   But the Atlanta Braves are moving their Class-A affiliate to Rome,
Ga., where voters approved funding to build a $15-million stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta infielder Marcus Giles played at Macon in 1998 and
remembers it fondly. He recalls the drainage problems, however.</TE>
<TE>   "It stayed pretty soaked," he said. "There were some games where,
after a rain delay, they put up yellow tape from right center all the
way to the foul pole, about 10 to 20 feet short of the wall. Anything
in there was a ground-rule double."</TE>
<TE>   Letting go: Atlanta first base coach Glenn Hubbard isn't
nostalgic. He coached in Macon and remembers a month-long trip in
1994, after the Ocmulgee River had flooded the park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to move on. History is inside of you, the memories," he
said. "Hey, my house burned down a few years ago. That gave me a new
perspective. I learned that all the things I had were just things."</TE>

Devil Rays, who recently played the Angels and have the worst record

<HD>Duke Skid Is Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Coach Carl Franks won five Southeastern Conference titles and a
national championship while he was an assistant at Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Yet few of those victories were as memorable as this one at
Durham, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Devils ended a 23-game losing streak Saturday, beating
East Carolina, 23-16, behind Alex Wade's 109 rushing yards and
Brendan Dewan's 28-yard interception return for a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   Blue Devils players dumped a cooler of ice water on the
fourth-year coach, who improved to 4-30 at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "We got into territory we hadn't been in before in a long time,"
Franks said. "This has to be one of the biggest wins I've been
involved with."</TE>
<TE>   Duke, which hadn't won since beating Wake Forest in November 1999,
ended the nation's longest losing skid by jumping to a 20-point lead
in the first half and holding off the Pirates in a steady rain at
Wallace Wade Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Fans milled around the sideline as the final seconds ticked off
the clock. Once the game ended, many charged to the middle of the
field to celebrate with the team, while others tore down both sets of
uprights.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to see them excited," quarterback Chris Dapolito
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not really used to that."</TE>
<TE>   Wade helped secure it for Duke, often requiring several defenders
to bring him down behind an offensive line that controlled the
Pirates' front seven.</TE>
<TE>   With his team nursing a 20-16 lead early in the fourth quarter,
the 260-pound fullback carried the ball nine consecutive times for 46
yards, leading to Brent Garber's 41-yard field goal with about three
minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first 100-yard game for Wade, a junior.</TE>
<TE>   East Carolina had a chance to tie it, but Matt Zielinski sacked
Paul Troth on fourth down with 1:15 to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Greg Jones ran for a career-high 173 yards as the
fifth-ranked Florida State racked up 397 yards rushing in a 40-19
victory over Virginia at Tallahassee, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has surpassed 100 yards in four consecutive games,
scored two touchdowns and averaged more than eight yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bobby Bowden said Jones is just getting started.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all in front of him," Bowden said. "He's just learning how
to change direction, dance around a little."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' 173 yards were the most by a Florida State back since 1996,
when Warrick Dunn gained 185 yards against Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles (2-0, 1-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) dropped
from No. 3 after narrowly defeating Iowa State last week, but they
jumped to a 33-0 lead Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia's Matt Schaub, who completed 19 of 25 passes for 247
yards, threw three fourth-quarter touchdowns to make the score
respectable for the Cavaliers (0-2, 0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Bowden recorded his 325th career coaching victory, leaving him
three behind all-time leader Joe Paterno of Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   Greg Golden ran for two touchdowns and Lamont Reid returned the
opening kickoff 90 yards for a score as No. 25 North Carolina State
(2-0) defeated East Tennessee State, 34-0, at Raleigh, N.C.... A.J.
Suggs threw three touchdown passes and Tony Hollings ran for 153
yards, helping new Coach Chan Gailey and Georgia Tech defeat
Vanderbilt, 45-3, at Atlanta.... Cal Murray ran for 101 yards and a

Carolina, 27-21, at Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   BIG EAST</TE>
<TE>   Ken Dorsey became the winningest quarterback at Miami as the
co-No. 1 Hurricanes overwhelmed Division I-AA Florida A&amp;M, 63-17, at
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey improved to 27-1 as a starter and moved past Gino Torretta
(26-2) on the school's career list. The Hurricanes also extended the
nation's longest winning streak to 23 games in dominating fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey played a little more than a quarter, spending part of the
first half with his hands on his hips and a towel around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   Brett Gordon passed for 321 yards and three touchdowns at
Piscataway, N.J., and Villanova defeated Rutgers, 37-19, for its

<DH>Thirty years after Munich, IOC battle against doping is far
from over</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The night before the men's 400-meter freestyle race at the 1972
Munich Olympics, Rick DeMont, a 16-year-old from the Bay Area, woke
up wheezing. He'd been taking allergy medications since he was 4, and
that night he took an anti-asthma pill, called Marax, so he could
breathe.</LD>
<LD>   The next morning, before the race, he took another Marax. It
contains ephedrine, a stimulant. Ephedrine, then and now, was on the
International Olympic Committee's banned list.</LD>
<LD>   But DeMont didn't believe there was any reason for concern. Before
the 1972 Games, he had filled out a standard medical form listing
medications he was taking, which, he presumed, meant that the
authorities had been dutifully notified. He was at the Games,
swimming, competing, so everything had to be OK, right? No one had
told him otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   That night, DeMont raced, and won, by one-hundredth of a second
over Australia's Bradford Cooper. A few days later, however, after
easily swimming a qualifying heat in the 1,500 meters--a race in
which he was the world-record holder--DeMont was told he had flunked
doping control. Bewildered and angry, he watched the 1,500 final from
the stands. In short order, he was also stripped of his gold medal in
the 400; it was awarded to Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years later, DeMont is still bewildered and occasionally
angry. At the 1972 Munich Games, he unwittingly emerged as the first
high-profile casualty of the IOC's campaign to slow--if not
stop--athletes' use of performance-enhancing substances, a
cat-and-mouse affair that until the last couple of years has been
most noteworthy for inconsistency in effort and result.</TE>
<TE>   For 30 years, DeMont, now a painter and an assistant swim coach at
the University of Arizona, has had his reputation stained by the
events in Munich. An Australian newspaper story published two years
ago, during the Sydney Games, labeled him the No. 2 Olympic "drug
cheat" of all time--behind only Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter
who won the men's 100-meter dash in Seoul in 1988 but was later found
to have been using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   In DeMont's case, the fault in Munich was not his but that of U.S.
team physicians, who didn't look at DeMont's medical form before the
Games and relay the information to IOC medical authorities.
Testifying during a congressional inquiry three years after the
Munich Games, Douglas Roby, a U.S. IOC member, said he believed
DeMont would have had his gold if the team doctor had simply "assumed
responsibility for the oversight."</TE>
<TE>   The DeMont case stands today as a reminder of the complex
political and pharmacological issues that still--after 30
years--trouble the Olympic movement as the IOC tries to rein in
athletes' use of drugs and other performance-enhancing substances.
And, as the IOC confronts a new generation of cheaters willing to
embrace a host of methods for enhancing performance--revolutionary
chemical substances, perhaps even the manipulation of human
genes--the DeMont case resonates as an illustration of the value of
caution and precision in applying policies and politics.</TE>
<TE>   That the fight against doping is the IOC's oft-proclaimed priority
is without question.</TE>
<TE>   "The IOC, I can say this, under my presidency, will be a witch
hunter in doping," Jacques Rogge, a Belgian physician elected IOC
president last year, said recently. "Zero tolerance. Pushing
relentlessly to test, and to catch the cheats. And we support WADA
wholeheartedly."</TE>
<TE>   WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, created in the wake of the
doping scandal in the 1998 Tour de France, has made what even
skeptical experts consider significant progress in advancing the
fight against doping. Perhaps most important, WADA represents not
just sports officials but governments worldwide. It coordinates
out-of-competition testing and monitors IOC testing at the Games.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency was constituted
to take responsibility for drug testing away from the U.S. Olympic
Committee. It took over that responsibility after the Sydney Games.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC and WADA have pursued with vigor the illicit use of the
synthetic hormone erythropoietin, or EPO--which boosts red blood cell
production, thus enabling athletes to train longer and harder--and
earlier this year surprised competitors at the Salt Lake Games with a
test for darbepoetin, an EPO variation.</TE>
<TE>   "I will acknowledge that some progress has been made," said
Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and authority on the history
of doping in Olympic sports. "I'm using words like 'perhaps' and
'maybe' because they," meaning the IOC and officials at Olympic sport
federations, "don't deserve better.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this awful history of them sticking their heads in the
sand.... I'm going to have to see them perform for four or five years
before I grab my pompoms and start leading the cheers."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, a new threat has emerged--the idea that athletes
could manipulate their bodies or enhance their performance by use of
genes. That is, an athlete could inject a gene into his or her body
and suddenly become stronger or faster.</TE>
<TE>   In March, WADA sponsored a Long Island, N.Y., conference that, for
the first time, brought together sports officials and leading
genetic-research scientists. Among them: Dr. H. Lee Sweeney, a
University of Pennsylvania researcher whose experiments with
genetically modified mice and rats show the double-edged nature of
such research.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's research, funded by the National Institutes for Health
and the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., involves injecting a synthetic gene
coded for a factor called IGF-1, which plays a critical role in
muscle growth and repair, directly into the animals' muscles, via a
harmless virus. One injection is sufficient for the life of the
animal.</TE>
<TE>   Rats injected with the gene got 15% stronger. Those injected with
the gene who then undertook a rat version of weightlifting got 30%
stronger. Recovery from injury was complete and rapid. Injected rats
who were allowed to grow old did not lose muscle strength as they
aged.</TE>
<TE>   The possibilities for beneficial therapy for dystrophy
sufferers--as well as aging-related muscle problems--are great. So,
too, however, is the lure for cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney said, "I've gotten contacted by lots of athletes, even one
coach," whom he declined to name, "who wanted me to treat his whole
football team, which I thought was pretty amusing."</TE>
<TE>   Without a muscle biopsy, detecting genetic manipulation done in
Sweeney's lab is currently impossible. It seems farfetched to imagine
the IOC ordering muscle biopsies on 10,000 athletes who compete at
the Summer Games--particularly given the cultural and religious
objections now to tests that sometimes involve the simple drawing of
blood.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney said it's simply a "matter of time" before athlete use of
gene therapy surfaces at the Olympics. In an opinion held by other
experts as well, he said, "I think the next Olympics," in Athens in
2004, "is too soon. I don't think they could get it together by the
next Olympics. But the one after that," in 2008 in Beijing, "if some
nation moves to the forefront in some strength or speed activity, I
might be a little suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge said the issues involved with genetic manipulation are
"fascinating" but said, "I'm not pessimistic." He said, "Classic
doping with drugs will still be the major danger for years to
come.... Because it's easy to get. It's cheap. It's not
sophisticated. Everyone can get access to anabolic steroids. Everyone
can get access to EPO. You don't need to be a rocket scientist."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the IOC, announcing one of several surveys conducted at
the 2000 Sydney Games, said athletes had admitted taking an average
of six to seven types of medication each. Products the athletes
admitted taking included anti-asthma products, multivitamins and
painkillers.</TE>
<TE>   One athlete, IOC medical chief Patrick Schamasch said, took 29
types of medication.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Wadler, a New York physician, professor and author who in
recent years has served as advisor to the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said, "We're a lot smarter in 2002 than
we were in 1972." Nonetheless, he added, "We're still working our way
through the same issues--issues relating to strict liability, which
is the keystone in the Olympic movement, issues of therapeutic
exemption and issues involving the disorder that comes up the most
frequently in the Olympic movement, and that's asthma."</TE>
<TE>   The incidence of alleged asthma sufferers in the Olympic
population has startled experts.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the IOC announced the results of a study finding that
7% of the athletes at the Sydney Games had declared they were
asthmatic; the incidence in the general population runs to about 1%,
the IOC said. Because many asthma inhalers deliver a combination of
medicines that can include stimulants, IOC officials were suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Alexandre de Merode, longtime head of the IOC medical
commission, described the 7% rate as "very bizarre." He said, "It
looks like the Games for the sick."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks ago, Dick Pound, a senior Canadian member of the
IOC who now heads WADA, wryly told reporters at the Commonwealth
Games in Manchester, England, "What the survey found was pockets of
extremely brave athletes who have apparently overcome asthma. Canada,
Australia, Britain and Germany were the countries mentioned. That is
where they have an inordinately high number of athletes who appear to
suffer from this condition but bravely put it behind them."</TE>

<HD>Daal Corners Astros in Win</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He lacks overpowering fastball but uses a variety
of pitches and locations in 4-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Houston Astros prepared for a feast Saturday night, and Dodger
left-hander Omar Daal left them scrounging for crumbs.</LD>
<LD>   Daal tantalized the Astros for 6 2/3 innings, mixing his
not-so-fast, 86-mph fastballs with a variety of pitches that barely
made catcher Paul Lo Duca's mitt pop, offerings that would seem
palatable to a decent high school player.</LD>
<LD>   But Daal rarely left anything over the plate, blanking Houston on
two hits to lead the Dodgers to a 4-0 victory before 29,652 in Minute
Maid Park.</LD>
<TE>   Daal's first victory over the Astros--he began the game with an
0-6 record and 7.43 earned-run average against them in his
career--moved the Dodgers within six games of the Arizona
Diamondbacks in the National League West and kept them a game ahead
of the surging San Francisco Giants in the NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros capped a three-run first inning with a two-run double,
and relievers Paul Shuey, Jesse Orosco and Paul Quantrill completed
the Dodgers' NL-leading 14th shutout of the season, while Houston
suffered only its fifth shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who was so frustrated about starting the season in the
bullpen he made numerous requests to be traded, improved to 11-6 and
is 4-0 with a 1.87 ERA in his last eight starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a frustrating 0-fer," said Astro first baseman Jeff
Bagwell, whose seventh-inning liner with runners on first and third
was snagged by Daal, who started a double play. "You don't see guys
who throw that way anymore, finesse pitchers. Most starters throw
92-95 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to be selective and aggressive at the same time,
find a pitch you're looking for and go to right field. Of course, it
doesn't always work out that way. That's the game plan for Tom
Glavine, and what does he have, 250 wins?"</TE>
<TE>   The word "overpowering" would not be found in any description of
Daal, but when you can locate five pitches--fastball, cut fastball,
changeup, curve and slider--on the corners, when you have excellent
command and rhythm and know how to set up hitters, who needs the
heat?</TE>
<TE>   "You come to the park against a guy like Omar thinking you're
going to get some good swings, but the guy never throws the ball over
the middle of the plate," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He just
paints you....</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to make a comparison to some of the better
left-handers who were not overpowering but were intelligent and used
very little of the plate, you'd have to go back to guys like Randy
Jones and John Tudor. Both of those guys were impact pitchers."</TE>
<TE>   Daal was an impact reliever, going 2-1 with a 1.50 ERA out of the
bullpen in April and May, but he has been one of baseball's best
starters since the All-Star break, allowing two earned runs or fewer
in each of his last eight starts.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who makes $5 million this season, accused the Dodgers of
"taking money out of my pocket" earlier this season, because he felt
his demotion to the bullpen would lessen his value on the free-agent
market this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The chances of Daal, 30, returning to Los Angeles next season
seemed remote at the time, but his recent run may force the
Dodgers--and Daal--to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like this organization," said Daal, who allowed only one
infield single in the first six innings Saturday. "I wasn't happy
going to the bullpen, because I knew I could be a starter, and I
proved what I could do.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mad early in the season, but every time I took the ball, I
did the job, because I'm a professional."</TE>
<TE>   Would Daal want to return in 2003?</TE>
<TE>   "Let's wait and see what happens," he said. "If they offer a
contract, my door is open. Right now, my focus is on helping this
team get to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, meanwhile, beat the Diamondbacks on Saturday for their
seventh straight win, and the Astros are six games behind the Dodgers
in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still early, but with the way San Francisco has been
playing, we just need to keep winning," Dodger right fielder Shawn
Green said. "It's obvious [the Giants] are a dangerous team when
[Barry] Bonds and [Jeff] Kent are hot. We've got to find ways to win
these games. The better we do now, the easier it will be the last few
weeks."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Coming Off Disabled List Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Left fielder Brian Jordan, limited to one game in the last three
weeks because of a protruding disk in his lower back, will be
activated off the disabled list today and is expected to start the
series finale against the Astros.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan has a reputation as a late-season clutch hitter--his
dramatic grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning capped a
seven-run rally that gave the Braves a key 8-5 win over the Mets last
Sept. 29--and he could make a difference as the Dodgers push for
their first playoff berth since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   "If he's right and does some of the things we've seen from afar in
the month of September, he could be a huge boost for our club,"
Manager Jim Tracy said. "But this guy has been hurt the majority of
the season, with a knee problem and a stiff back. I just hope he can
play seven more weeks as injury free as possible."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan, who is batting .268 with 13 homers and 50 runs batted in,
felt good after batting practice Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not going to say I'm 100%," he said. "It depends--when
you make that first dive, you never know what's going to happen. All
I can do is play hard. [If I don't play well], it's not going to be
from a lack of effort."</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom has been a capable replacement in left, giving
Tracy a viable option should Jordan not produce.</TE>
<TE>   "If things don't go well," Jordan said, "Trace will make the right
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the four players--outfielder Wilkin Ruan, pitcher Jeff
Williams, second baseman Joe Thurston and catcher David Ross--who
will be recalled from triple-A Las Vegas when the Dodgers expand
their roster today, Ruan and Williams could have the biggest impact.</TE>
<TE>   Like Chone Figgins has done for the Angels, the speedy Ruan will
give the Dodgers a potent, late-inning base-running threat. Ruan was
successful on all 12 stolen-base attempts in 40 games for Las Vegas
and stole 23 bases in 26 attempts in 78 games for double-A
Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a side-arm-throwing left-hander, gave up 12 earned runs
in 5 1/3 innings of four games for the Dodgers in May, but he
returned to Las Vegas and became a closer, going 6-4 with a 2.60
earned-run average and 28 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Williams could give Tracy a second situational left-hander in
front of Jesse Orosco, enabling the manager to use Williams in the
fifth or sixth inning and save Orosco for the seventh and eighth.
Thurston hit .334 with 38 doubles and a minor league-leading 196
hits, and Ross hit .298 with 14 homers and 65 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman James Loney, the Dodgers' first-round pick (19th
overall) in the June draft, broke his left wrist after being hit by a
pitch in a game for Class-A Vero Beach on Thursday and will be
sidelined for four to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Loney, who signed for $1.5 million, missed the final week of the
season and will not be able to participate in the fall instructional
league, as planned.</TE>
<TE>   He hit .303 in 66 at-bats for Vero Beach after batting .371 with
five homers and 30 RBIs in 170 at-bats for the Dodgers' rookie-league
affiliate in Great Falls, Mont.</TE>

effective and consistent starter, going 9-1 with a 3.15 ERA in his
last 20 starts. Dodger reliever Giovanni Carrara, sidelined since
Aug. 11 because of a strained right forearm, and utility infielder
Jeff Reboulet, out since July 19 because of a strained back, will be
activated off the disabled list today.</TE>

a goal against every team in Major League Soccer except one--the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars.</LD>
<LD>   It took the Galaxy forward less than five minutes to rectify that
Saturday night. Then he did it again 19 minutes later. And in the
game's 83rd minute, Ruiz's demolition of the MetroStars was complete
as he scored his third goal of the night.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz's first hat trick not only gave the Galaxy a 3-0 victory over
the MetroStars in front of 19,854 at the Rose Bowl, it gave the
Galaxy (13-9-3) a share of first place in the Western Conference with
three games left.</LD>
<TE>   "I want what's best for the team," Ruiz said. "If the goals help
that out, that's even better. At the end of the road, we all want
what's best for the team. I think we're getting better as the
playoffs get closer."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first hat trick for a Galaxy player since Cobi Jones
did it at New England on Aug. 22, 1998, and the 11th in team history.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's three goals also gave him a league-leading 20 this season,
one behind the team record set by Eduardo Hurtado in the league's
inaugural season of 1996. Ruiz, who now has 41 points, also pulled
ahead of New England's Taylor Twellman (39) in the MLS scoring race.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he does," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said of Ruiz. "He
scores goals. I think his biggest motivation is when Twellman scores.
Carlos feels he has to keep up with him."</TE>
<TE>   While the Galaxy clinched its seventh playoff berth in the
league's seven-year history--only the Galaxy and the Dallas Burn have
been in the postseason every season--with New England's tie earlier
in the day, the victory was sweet redemption. The Galaxy had been
handed its worst loss in team history, 5-0, by the MetroStars on June
15.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz gave the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the game's fourth minute.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the ball up the middle of the field, Ruiz found Simon
Elliott on the right wing and Elliott quickly passed back to the
middle of the goalkeeper's box, where Sasha Victorine collided with
MetroStar defender Craig Ziadie.</TE>
<TE>   The ball trickling through, an opportunistic Ruiz rushed forward
and his left-footed shot found the left side of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's second goal came in the 23rd minute.</TE>
<TE>   Jones passed to Victorine in the middle of the penalty box and
Victorine headed the ball back to Ruiz, who immediately blasted a
right-footed shot into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's third goal came when, with Jones lofting a high pass into
the middle of the goalkeeper's box from the right side, Victorine
drew MetroStar defender Mike Petke to the near post and an unmarked
Ruiz headed the ball in.</TE>

<HD>Edison's Grady Leads Class of Quarterbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When quarterback Tommy Grady stands in the pocket, he surveys the
field like a gunslinger ready for target practice.</LD>
<LD>   "I see everything," said Grady, who is 6 feet 6 1/2, 225 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   He cocks his arm, focuses his eyes and salivates over the
unobstructed view some other quarterbacks don't get to experience.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no lineman taller than me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And this season there should be no quarterback in Southern
California better than Grady, who is entering his senior year at
Huntington Beach Edison High.</TE>
<TE>   College coaches have taken notice, and on Thursday, Grady
committed to Oklahoma, choosing the Sooners over some of the top
passing schools in the nation, including Miami and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   This season, hoping to take advantage of Grady's size and arm
strength, Edison figures to run most of its offensive sets out of a
shotgun formation. Much of the summer was dedicated to giving Grady's
new group of receivers the chance to establish a comfort zone
catching passes from him.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Grady started the season unknown and untested.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit worried about his mobility and how he'd handle
getting pressured because sophomore year he didn't handle it great,"
Coach Dave White said. "But from Game 1, he got better and better. In
the playoffs, he was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Grady finished his junior season with 2,790 yards passing, 33
touchdowns and only three interceptions. In a four-game stretch of
the Division I playoffs, it was as if the back of Grady's jersey
suddenly read, "Elway."</TE>
<TE>   During the most tension-filled part of the season, he completed 57
of 85 passes for 1,153 yards and 16 touchdowns. There was a
five-touchdown performance against La Puente Bishop Amat in the
quarterfinals. There were two touchdown passes against Santa Ana
Mater Dei in the semifinals. Against Long Beach Poly in the Division
I final, a 42-28 Edison defeat, Grady threw four touchdown passes and
earned respect for his accuracy, toughness and composure.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me a lot of confidence," he said of the Poly game. "There
were a lot of good players out there. I stood in the pocket and took
the hits."</TE>
<TE>   White can't remember an Edison player making such dramatic
improvement in a year's time.</TE>
<TE>   "He made strides from his sophomore to junior year maybe bigger
than anyone we've had," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the ultimate compliment comes from Grady's brother, Jeff,
the starting quarterback for Fresno State. Jeff was at Edison Field
last December to watch his brother take on Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of in awe," he said. "I've been in school a couple of
years and never got the chance to see him grow up ... and see his
improvement. I'm a little biased, but I haven't seen a high school
quarterback like him.</TE>
<TE>   "He really showed me a lot. He made some throws I can't make and a
lot of college quarterbacks couldn't make. The most surprising thing
was his poise. He was oblivious to everything. He was oblivious to
the crowd, he was oblivious to the athletes on the team, oblivious to
the rush. He kept making throws."</TE>
<TE>   Some have questioned Grady's college potential, worried he might
be too tall and too slow to play a position that requires
maneuverability and quick instincts. But Grady thinks he passes the
test.</TE>
<TE>   His 40-yard time has dropped from 5.1 seconds to 4.8. He's a
three-sport athlete, with basketball aiding his mobility and baseball
helping his mental toughness. He had a 30-yard run last season, and
lots of hours spent in the weight room this summer have left him in
peak physical condition.</TE>
<TE>   One of Grady's strengths is that he's fearless in the pocket. He
will stand in the face of a rush to find a way to get the ball to his
receivers. It's a gift that every college coach looks for in a
quarterback.</TE>

<HD>Yao Shows What a Tall Order It's Going to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>For a few hours Saturday night, the RCA Dome seemed like someplace
entirely different, someplace thousands of miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Red-and-yellow banners festooned with Chinese characters fluttered
through the crowd. A drum beat pounded as girls chanted the name of a
far-off nation.</LD>
<LD>   The United States might have won this first-round game at the
World Basketball Championship, overcoming a slow start to defeat
China, 84-65, but the featured attraction was the center on the
losing team, Yao Ming.</LD>
<TE>   American fans wanted a glimpse of the 7-foot-5 oddity who became
famous overnight when the Houston Rockets selected him first in the
June NBA draft. Chinese fans--more vociferous and noticeable among
the 22,619 in attendance--came to cheer for their exceptional
countryman.</TE>
<TE>   "Today was like a home game," said Yao, who gazed around the
stands during warmups. "It was a big crowd, the Chinese crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most interested spectator was Rocket Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, who, like others around the league, is eager to know how
Yao will fare in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Though the likes of Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan are not on
this U.S. squad, the 21-year-old faced NBA veteran Antonio Davis for
much of the night and displayed a soft touch, scoring 10 points on
jump shots from close range and a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid could be really good," said U.S. Coach George Karl, who
got his first look at Yao during an exhibition in Oakland last month.
"From the standpoint of skill and size, he's extremely impressive."</TE>
<TE>   League observers expect Yao will need to gain upper-body strength
if he is to compete inside, and Saturday's performance did nothing to
alter that prognosis. Though he grabbed six rebounds and, on one
occasion, backed down the 6-foot-9 Davis for a turnaround jumper, Yao
was mostly a nonentity under the boards.</TE>
<TE>   He also got into foul trouble early, relegating him to the bench
for long stretches. The same thing happened in Oakland, and Yao
appears to be a quick study when it comes to one NBA skill: Griping.</TE>
<TE>   "The fouls are not my problem," he said. "I have no control over
the whistle. It's the referee who controls the whistle."</TE>
<TE>   When Yao was at his best, the underdog Chinese team--which also
features Denver Nugget forward Menke Bateer and sharpshooting guard
Hu Weidong--held a lead through much of the first half. The
Americans, as Karl put it, "got startled a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   And then they got started.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case against Germany the night before, the U.S. turned
up the tempo and pulled away after halftime. Paul Pierce, emerging as
the team's go-to guy, had a team-high 19 points and got help from
Shawn Marion with 15 and Michael Finley with 14. The no-nonsense Ben
Wallace supplied interior defense and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory the U.S. advances to the second round with a 3-0
record and, after a day of rest today, will face Russia on Monday.
China (1-2) also advances.</TE>
<TE>   But if Yao's performance was, as he put it, "only ordinary," his
star appeal was decidedly better. The NBA is hoping his arrival will
help tap a new market, selling more tickets among Chinese Americans
and merchandise among millions of fans in China.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night offered a glimpse of the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The banners and posters. All those fans dressed in red and
chanting "China, China." There was even the sound of fireworks
outside, the city holding its annual Labor Day celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very exciting to see such a big guy with such skills," said
Qi Lu, a student at Southern Illinois University who brought his
friends and an ornamental drum to the game. "There are a lot of
Chinese people living here and they want to see him."</TE>
<TE>   Yao suggested he might give them a better show in the future,
saying, "I'm excited to play more games in the United States."</TE>

<HD>Magical Ride for Stevens</HD>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>When jockey Eddie Delahoussaye went down in a spill early Friday
evening, Bo Hirsch, the owner of Del Mar Debutante hopeful Miss
Houdini, immediately phoned his trainer Warren Stute.</LD>
<LD>   Hirsch told Stute, who will turn 81 on Sept. 30, they were going
to need a new rider. "If Gary Stevens is open, we'll get him," Stute
said.</LD>
<LD>   With Delahoussaye absent because of soreness until Wednesday,
Stevens, who just started riding again on Friday after undergoing
arthroscopic knee surgery on Aug. 1, did inherit Miss Houdini, an
11-1 shot, and they performed some magic together Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Making her second career start seven weeks after she broke her
maiden at nearly 9-1 at Hollywood Park, the 2-year-old Belong To Me
filly swept to the lead around the turn, drew clear, then held off an
unlucky Santa Catarina, the 9-10 favorite, to win by a neck in the
$250,000 Debutante.</TE>
<TE>   The last Grade I of the meet made it a sweep for the Stute
brothers of the two local major stakes for 2-year-old fillies. Three
weeks earlier, Mel Stute, 75, had won the Sorrento with
Buffythecenterfold.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to remain unbeaten and become the first to win both the
Sorrento and Debutante since Brave Raj in 1986, Buffythecenterfold
faded to seventh as the 7-2 second choice after prompting the early
pace.</TE>
<TE>   Hampered by a leg infection after her initial victory, Miss
Houdini, who is out of the mare Magical Maiden, a stakes winner and
earner of over $900,000 for Warren Stute, was given ample time to
recuperate, but her trainer wasn't brimming with confidence going
into the Debutante.</TE>
<TE>   "I only bet $40," he laughed while glancing out at the $24.80 win
price showing on the tote board. "If I really liked her, I would have
bet a couple of hundred.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she broke that great, but she loomed up there fast.
She did get to the front a little early, but I have a lot of
confidence in Gary."</TE>
<TE>   Favored on the strength of an impressive maiden victory on Aug.
11, Santa Catarina lacked room at a critical stage entering the
stretch, and while she and Mike Smith were searching for somewhere to
run, Miss Houdini had opened up a big advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The $950,000 yearling purchase made up nearly all of the deficit
in the last furlong while finishing 9 1/2 lengths clear of 12-1 shot
Indy Groove, who won a three-way battle for third over Sea Jewel and
Little Bit A Swiss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making only his second start for owner John Oxley and trainer John
Ward, Sky Mesa became a Grade I winner, scoring a surprise in the
$200,000 Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-furlong Hopeful was supposed to be dominated by Zavata,
the 3-10 favorite and a winner of three in a row, including a pair of
stakes, but the son of Phone Trick could do no better than third,
nearly four lengths behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Edgar Prado, Sky Mesa, a 2-year-old son of Pulpit and
the 7-2 second choice, won by 1 3/4 lengths over 17-1 shot Pretty
Wild in 1:23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Jose Valdivia Jr. had a profitable day in Pennsylvania,
winning the two richest events in the fourth annual Claiming Crown at
Philadelphia Park.</TE>
<TE>   Valdivia won the $125,000 Emerald Stakes on turf with favored
Nowrass, then came back a race later to take the $150,000 Jewel
Stakes with California shipper and 8-5 choice Truly A Judge.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Dave Bernstein for owners Gaylord Ailshie and Alan
Aidekman, the 4-year-old Judge T C colt completed the 1 1/8 miles in
1:50 1/5 while defeating 5-1 third choice Quiet Mike by 5 1/4
lengths.</TE>

<LD>The last three winners of the $250,000 Del Mar Handicap were trained
by either a Frankel or a Canani.</LD>
<LD>   There is a chance the same will hold true after the Grade II is
run for the 63rd time today.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Frankel, who has won the last two runnings, will send out
Blue Steller and Dance Dreamer while Julio Canani will try to emulate
son Nick's win in 1999 when he starts French import Mister Kybelee.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Juddmonte Farms, Dance Dreamer, a 4-year-old Nureyev
colt, has won three of four since arriving in the U.S. His most
recent victory came in the Escondido Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Steller, meanwhile, has won two in a row for Amerman Racing
and has two wins and a third in three starts on the Del Mar turf
course. Kent Desormeaux will ride Dance Dreamer while Patrick
Valenzuela has the call on Blue Steller.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership, Mister Kybelee has trained well for his
first start in this country after winning two of 10 overseas. He is
proven at marathon distances and will race with Lasix for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the Del Mar Handicap, 2001 Breeders' Cup Sprint and
Eclipse Award winner Squirtle Squirt will make his comeback in the
$250,000 Forego Handicap, a Grade I, at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Idle since he finished second to Snow Ridge in the Palos Verdes
Handicap on Jan. 27 at Santa Anita, Squirtle Squirt will be opposed
in the seven-furlong race by Orientate, Silky Sweep, Saint Verre,
Multiple Choice, Hook And Ladder, Aldebaran and Explicit.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Adalgisa, who was impressive in her U.S. debut
for Canani, will try for her second win in today's second at Del Mar,
a $60,000 allowance at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Martin. The trainer won with four of his first
five starters at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Martin Kenney. The trainer is one for 43 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three with Adalgisa in the second,
using Gamblin Town and Prime Step in the third and Give Away Joe,
Going Going Gone and George's Stick in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/68. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $400.80. Total money bet: $580.</TE>

<HD>Willingham, Irish Golden in Opener</HD>
<DH>College football: Notre Dame impresses in coach's historic
debut, dominating No. 21 Maryland, 22-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>All that could be seen of Tyrone Willingham was his sinewy arm
holding up the golden trophy.</LD>
<LD>   It is not a trophy any Fighting Irish coach or player dreams of
possessing, but in its symbolism, at this moment, it seemed almost as
good as a national championship bauble.</LD>
<LD>   On the night of his first game as the first African American head
coach at Notre Dame, Willingham allowed himself to smile, but not too
much, to hold up his arm, but not too high, to clench a fist, but not
too tightly.</LD>
<TE>   Unranked Notre Dame upset No. 21 Maryland, 22-0, in the 20th and
final Kickoff Classic football game Saturday night in front of 72,903
at the Meadowlands. The majority were curious Fighting Irish rooters,
eager to watch and critique the newest Fighting Irish coach.</TE>
<TE>   What they saw was a team that seemed certain in what it was doing.
What they saw was junior quarterback Carlyle Holiday confident in the
plays that were called and in the way he was asked to both throw and
scramble.</TE>
<TE>   What they saw was a defense sturdy in its technique, seldom fooled
by the Maryland option or left flat-footed by Maryland speed, one
that allowed only 16 yards rushing and sacked Maryland quarterbacks
four times.</TE>
<TE>   They saw five field goals and a punt returned for a touchdown,
three interceptions by Notre Dame players, no lost fumbles. There
were too many penalties (11 for 80 yards), but those could be excused
even by demanding Notre Dame alumni as the result of a new coach
teaching a new system to a team still shaking off the criticism of a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham would not share his heart with the world after a game
in which his Irish outgained Maryland, a 10-2 team a year ago, 356
yards to 133. He would not wear his emotions on his sleeve after
Holiday had completed 17 of 27 passes for 226 yards. All during the
game, the coach stood on the sideline protected by his own arc of
silence, as sacred as the two-yard safety zone allowed for punt
returners.</TE>
<TE>   For the head coach of Notre Dame--no matter his race and no matter
his length of service, no matter his past successes or the promise of
future brilliance--is allowed no honeymoon, no grace period to find
his voice, to implant his vision on the program.</TE>
<TE>   So when Willingham, a solitary, straight-backed man with an
expressionless face, chose to try a 56-yard field goal instead of
going for a first down on fourth and one on Notre Dame's first
possession of the 2002 season, the Notre Dame fans at the Meadowlands
booed.</TE>
<TE>   The ones around the country, the subway alums who clog the
Internet message boards and chat rooms, they were probably booing
too, certain that this serious, conservative coach would make their
future one of safety and boredom instead of gutsy risk-taking and
chill-bump thrills.</TE>
<TE>   The field-goal try was missed, but not by much. And then the
Fighting Irish kicker, Nicholas Setta, ended up setting a Kickoff
Classic record with five field goals. He never missed another--from
51 yards, 32 yards, 18 yards, 46 yards, 24 yards. He was named the
game's most valuable player and he gave his coach a playful rub on
the head on the way to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Vontez Duff became the first man in the 20-year history of this
game to return a punt for a touchdown--76 yards of celebratory
running early in the third quarter that made a tenuous 9-0 lead an
authoritative 16-0--and there was no more booing. Cornerback Shane
Walton set a school record with three interceptions and there was
lots of cheering.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what this occasion felt like, Willingham answered
simply, "It was a football game. All football games are important."
He would not allow anyone to make this into anything historical. He
would only allow anyone to make this a single step in a long process
of building and improvement.</TE>
<TE>   He was quick to point out that Maryland's biggest offensive
threat, tailback Bruce Perry, a Doak Walker Award finalist last year,
was out with an injured groin. He asked to not make too much of the
shutout even though he had just become the first Notre Dame coach
since Terry Brennan in 1954 to earn a shutout in his first game.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the same players who participated in a dispiriting 5-6
season last year that ended in the firing of coach Bob Davie--players
who always seemed tentative and without faith in what they were
doing--were now operating Willingham's West Coast offense and basic
defensive principles with authority.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a clear idea of what is expected of us," said Holiday,
who caused Willingham to exhibit his only emotion of the evening
after a careless attempt to throw away a ball cost his team an
intentional grounding penalty. Willingham yelled at Holiday. Then,
just before the quarterback went back on the field, Willingham patted
his back.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Willingham has a real vision," said Walton, who had eight
tackles. "He's even-keeled and demanding and we know what is expected
on every play."</TE>
<TE>   The coach had already left the room. He was standing alone in a
hallway, staring at the statistics.</TE>

<HD>Women's Group to Appeal to CBS</HD>
<DH>Golf: Plans are in place to pressure network to drop its
coverage of the Masters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENE LYNCH and DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of a women's organization that urged the host of the Masters
to admit its first female member said Saturday she will now target
CBS and put pressure on the network to drop coverage of the
most-watched golf tournament on television.</LD>
<LD>   But CBS said Saturday it will broadcast the 2003 Masters as
planned, despite a campaign by the National Council of Women's
Organizations. The CBS announcement came a day after the Augusta
National Golf Club announced it would forgo commercial television
sponsorship--a first--rather than subject sponsors IBM, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup to protests.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Burk, executive director of the NCWO, said she plans to
appeal directly to the network, which has broadcast the Masters since
1956.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be the same approach as I took with the sponsors," she
said. "I will appeal to them that they follow their corporate ...
policies on discrimination. I will ask them to honor that, pointing
out that their consumers, stockholders and employees would
undoubtedly applaud their decision not to underwrite discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   CBS spokeswoman Leslie Anne Wade declined comment Saturday except
to say that "CBS will broadcast the Masters next year."</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she was surprised by the announcement Friday by the golf
club's chairman, Hootie Johnson, to drop commercial sponsorship of
the Masters. "I expected the sponsors to say they would pull out for
the country club to announce the first woman member," she said. "This
I did not expect."</TE>
<TE>   She said she had spoken to two of the sponsors two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They both said they were taking this very seriously," said Burk,
who added she thought the sponsors urged the club to address the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   None of the corporate sponsors were available Saturday. Burk's
group has about six million members from 160 organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy began earlier this year when Johnson was contacted
by Burk, who challenged the lack of female members. Johnson took
exception and fired back in public, insisting that the private club
would not succumb to pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said when the council urged the tournament's corporate
sponsors--who also are the television advertisers--to help them apply
pressure on the club, he decided the event would be commercial free.
The club's 300 members are said to be prepared to absorb any
financial losses, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters, held in April, attracted about 40 million viewers
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception in 1934, the Masters has been played at
picturesque Augusta National. Although there is no official policy
that excludes women at the Georgia club, it has never had a female
member. Its first African American member was admitted in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the financial arrangement between the golf club and CBS
have not been disclosed. But the club, paid by CBS for the right to
broadcast the event, has unusual control over the 12 1/2 hours
televised by CBS and the USA Network. Unlike with other sporting
events, Augusta enlists sponsors on its own. The networks are
permitted only four minutes of commercial air time each hour. The
normal figure is 16 minutes an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Sports marketing expert Dean Bonham said any negative publicity
CBS may suffer would likely be overshadowed by the Masters' huge
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that CBS is not in any way condoning
the practices of this private club. They are bringing a sporting
event to the masses," said Bonham, head of the Bonham Group in
Denver. "And if they do it without commercials, the golf community
will appreciate it all the more. I doubt that the negative image of a
club that [allegedly] discriminates against women will rub off on
CBS."</TE>

<HD>They Want to Rush USC's Turnaround</HD>
<DH>College football: Offensive linemen seek to return Trojans
to glory days of Tailback U.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They spent hours in the weight room but acknowledge that strength
alone cannot lift a veil of uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   They study technique in the classroom and hone it on the practice
field, but understand that performance is the only way to block
criticism.</LD>
<LD>   USC's offensive linemen emphatically believe that the Trojans'
success this season falls squarely on their experienced but largely
unproven shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, most of the same players were party to a rushing
average of 87.7 yards, the lowest in the Pacific 10 Conference and
109th among 115 teams nationally. The Trojans' 1,052 yards rushing
were the fewest since 1948, the first year school records were kept.
Quarterback Carson Palmer was sacked 36 times.</TE>
<TE>   USC finished 6-6 under first-year Coach Pete Carroll and ended the
season with an embarrassing 10-6 loss to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl,
a game in which the Trojans had only one yard rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do our job," senior Zach Wilson said of the line's
play. "We all know we messed up bad."</TE>
<TE>   To a man, the returning players accept responsibility. They
downplay injuries that required fullback Sunny Byrd to start at
tailback for the last six games and made Sultan McCullough, who sat
out half the season, the leading rusher with only 410 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "The criticism was deserved," said junior Norm Katnik, who played
all three line positions last season. "USC used to be Student Body
Right and Student Body Left. Last year it was 87 yards a game and
last in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely going to improve this year to get that
reputation back."</TE>
<TE>   From the mid-1960s to the early '80s, USC earned its moniker as
Tailback U with ballcarriers such as Heisman Trophy winners Mike
Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus Allen and
All-Americans Anthony Davis and Ricky Bell. But the reputation was
built on a foundation of talented offensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Yary, Pete Adams, Marvin Powell, Pat Howell, Brad Budde, Keith
Van Horne, Roy Foster, Bruce Matthews and Tony Boselli are only some
of the All-Americans who cleared the way for Trojan runners.</TE>
<TE>   USC, however, has not produced an All-American offensive lineman
since Boselli in 1994, a streak likely to extend another year.</TE>
<TE>   When USC plays Auburn in its opener Monday at the Coliseum,
returning starters will fill all but one position on an offensive
line that averages 6 feet 4 inches, 293 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Katnik, 6-4, 280, will start at center, as two-year starter Lenny
Vandermade (6-3, 275) moves to left guard. Juniors Jacob Rogers (6-6,
305) and Eric Torres (6-5, 300) will play left and right tackle,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (6-5, 300) suffered a foot strain on the first day of
training camp and will miss the opener, so Fred Matua (6-3, 305),
from Wilmington Banning High, is expected to start at right guard. If
he is not sidelined by a bruised right knee, Matua will become the
first freshman to start an opener on the offensive line since Travis
Claridge in 1996, and he gives the unit a shot of aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a whole bunch of ingredients in this line," Matua said.
"It's just like your mom's cooking. It doesn't taste good if you
don't have any sugar. I bring the sugar and it's going to start
cooking."</TE>
<TE>   When Wilson returns, he will work at guard and tackle. Senior
Derek Graf (6-4, 280) has practiced at center and guard. Senior
tackle Phillip Eaves (6-7, 310) and sophomore guard Travis Watkins
(6-3, 300) are in the mix, along with freshman tackles Winston
Justice (6-6, 305) and Kyle Williams (6-6, 280), center-guard Chris
Doyle (6-1, 285) and guard Kurt Katnik (6-4, 255).</TE>
<TE>   While returning players bulked up in the weight room during the
off-season, Carroll moved to improve their play by hiring fiery Tim
Davis as an additional offensive line coach. Davis, who worked the
previous five seasons at Wisconsin, is responsible for guards and
centers. Keith Uperesa, in his second season with the Trojans,
handles tackles and tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   "With two guys, the players can get better coaching," said Norm
Chow, USC's offensive coordinator. "There are four eyes on them
instead of two."</TE>
<TE>   The difference is noticeable to linemen on both sides of the line
of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're leaps and bounds ahead of where we were in any of the years
I've been here," said Rogers, who arrived at USC in 1999. "We still
have plenty of gains to make before the first game, but we're on the
right path."</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Shaun Cody also senses positive change.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, it seemed like the O-line was kind of blah," Cody
said. "This year, they have pep, some attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Depth at running back should also aid the offensive line.
McCullough, who rushed for 1,163 yards in 2000, is sound. Justin
Fargas, a transfer from Michigan, is eligible after redshirting last
season. And Malaefou MacKenzie returns after the NCAA granted him a
sixth year of eligibility. Sophomore Darryl Poston and freshman
Hershel Dennis also will play.</TE>
<TE>   "We're much more precise about things we're trying to do with the
run game, and I think we've adapted some things in pass protection
that will make a difference," Carroll said. "If those two areas are
better, it gives us a heck of chance to see how good we can be.
Without that, it's going to be a struggle."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Holdout receiver Jimmy Smith and the Jacksonville Jaguars have come
to terms on a new contract, ending a holdout that endured through the
team's exhibition season. Terms of the contract were not immediately
available.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Dan Edwards confirmed that the Jaguars will make an
official announcement today, ending a 38-day holdout that brought the
Jacksonville offense to a screeching halt in the exhibition season.</LD>
<LD>   In four exhibition games, Mark Brunell and the first-team offense
didn't manage a touchdown. Receivers Bobby Shaw and Patrick Johnson
had trouble getting open, and Brunell showed little confidence in his
new pass catchers.</LD>
<TE>   Smith has been the most prolific pass catcher in the NFL over the
last six years, although his big-play ability waned last season--he
made just four plays of 30-plus yards and scored only eight
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's contract, which would have paid him $2.75 million this
season, didn't put him among the 10 highest-paid receivers in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   He was seeking a deal that would have paid him about $12 million
over the next two years. But the Jaguars were reluctant to hand over
that much to a 33-year-old receiver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Edwards, a 1999 first-round draft choice who had fallen out
of the Pittsburgh Steelers' receiver rotation, was traded to the St.
Louis Rams for a sixth-round draft pick. Edwards, no longer being
used regularly by the Steelers in any role, said he was resigned to
being traded or released.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to play for someone who wants me," said Edwards, who
had 37 catches for no touchdowns the last two seasons. Edwards has a
sprained knee and probably won't be ready to play for a couple of
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An MRI on Houston Texan quarterback David Carr's bruised right
knee revealed no damage and the rookie should be ready for the season
opener against Dallas.... Tight end Rickey Dudley and offensive guard
Tre Johnson, two veterans trying to come back from injuries, were
released by the Cleveland Browns. The team also acquired tight end
Steve Heiden from the San Diego Chargers for a seventh-round draft
pick in 2003.... Tight end Desmond Clark, Denver's second-leading
receiver last season, was released by the Broncos.... Russell
Maryland, the top pick in the 1991 NFL draft who helped Dallas win
three Super Bowls, re-signed with the team so he could retire as a
Cowboy.... The Arizona Cardinals waived backup quarterback Chris
Greisen, leaving rookie Josh McCown as the No. 2 quarterback....
Running back Maurice Smith and free safety Keith Lyle were among 13
players waived by the Atlanta Falcons.</TE>

<HD>Marrero's Power Lifts Cardinals Over Cubs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Marrero showcased his power after a six-week homer drought,
helping the St. Louis Cardinals sweep a doubleheader from the Chicago
Cubs and pad their lead in the National League Central.</LD>
<LD>   Marrero, who hadn't homered since July 20, hit a grand slam in the
second game at Chicago to cap a six-run third inning Saturday night
as the Cardinals rolled to a 10-4 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "It gave us a comfortable lead," said Marrero, who later made a
great throw to stop a Chicago rally. "I was just trying to relax, put
the ball in play and let good things happen. You learn from that."</LD>
<TE>   Marrero also homered in the opener, as did Albert Pujols and
Eduardo Perez, leading the Cardinals to an 8-1 win.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Benes (4-4) won for the fourth time in his last seven starts,
giving up three hits and six walks in five innings of the nightcap.
He also homered in the fourth off Jason Bere (1-10).</TE>
<TE>   Pujols, who went three for four in the opener, hit his 32nd homer,
a solo shot that extended the Cardinals' lead to 2-0 in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Marrero hit his 11th homer in the eighth to make it 5-1 and Perez
hit his third pinch homer, a three-run shot in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Cubs starter Mark Prior (6-6) left the game because of a strained
left hamstring, departing before delivering a pitch to start the top
of the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the fifth, Prior ran to first after a
third-strike wild pitch by Hackman and then slid hard into second
base on a fielder's choice.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, New York 0--The Mets completed the worst home
month in National League history, losing to Randy Wolf and Phillies
for their 13th consecutive defeat at Shea Stadium. Wolf pitched a
four-hitter and Jimmy Rollins hit an RBI single in the eighth inning
as the Mets tied a team record for consecutive home losses set in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   At 0-13, the Mets became the first NL team to go winless at home
in a month while playing at least 10 games. Wolf struck out Roger
Cedeno for the fourth time with runners on first and second to end
the game, triggering a chorus of loud boos.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 11, Cincinnati 2--Jorge Fabregas hit two of Milwaukee's
five home runs off Chris Reitsma as the Brewers won at Cincinnati.
Alex Sanchez, Ryan Thompson and Matt Stairs also homered off Reitsma
(5-10). The last Cincinnati pitcher to give up five home runs in a
game was Brett Tomko on June 15, 1999, against the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was not in the Brewers' original starting lineup but was
inserted when Milwaukee announced just before the game that Mark
Loretta had been traded to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Montreal 3--Andruw Jones and Mark DeRosa homered and
Chris Hammond pitched two scoreless innings for his seventh relief
win as the Braves won at Montreal. Jones led off the seventh with his
27th homer--his first since Aug. 17--to break a 3-3 tie. John Smoltz
saved his second consecutive game, pitching the ninth for his major
league-leading 48th save.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 3, Colorado 0--Rookie Clay Condrey pitched 7 1/3 shutout
innings in his first major league start as the Padres won at San
Diego to hand the Rockies their eighth consecutive loss. The Padres
shut out the Rockies for the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Pittsburgh 2--Kevin Millar hit a tiebreaking sacrifice
fly in the eighth inning and the Marlins won at Miami.</TE>

<HD>Giants Trump Another Arizona Ace</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rueter and three relievers beat Schilling, 5-0,
one night after San Francisco defeated Johnson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Any team that defeats Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling on consecutive
days must be on a roll, even if San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker
won't admit it.</LD>
<LD>   "Not yet," Baker said, "but we're on our way."</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Rueter and three relievers combined on a five-hitter Saturday
at Phoenix, as the Giants won their seventh in a row, 5-0, over
Schilling and the slumping Arizona Diamondbacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The name of the game is pitching," Baker said. "If anybody knows
that, it's the Diamondbacks. We took a page out of their book, I
guess."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling and Johnson lost on consecutive days for the first time.
They lost consecutive games on Aug. 23 and 25 of 2000, but there was
an off day in between. Schilling lost to Milwaukee, then two days
later Johnson lost to the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are great pitchers, but you have to believe you can
win and beat them too," said David Bell, who hit one of two home runs
off Schilling. "It's something we should be really happy with, but at
the same time it's just two games."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (21-5), who lost to a National League West team for the
first time this season, gave up three runs, four hits and struck out
nine in seven innings. His four walks, one intentional, were his most
in 88 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime Schil walks four guys in a month, it catches you by
surprise," Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said, "but I don't think it was
anything Curt did wrong. I just think it was a real good approach by
the Giants' hitters."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks lost their season-worst fourth in a row, two to
the Dodgers and two to San Francisco, the teams chasing them in the
NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton and Rich Aurilia hit home runs for the Giants. San
Francisco matched its longest winning streak of the season and is
seven games behind first-place Arizona in the NL West. The Giants are
6-0 with one game left on their trip.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling had won 12 in a row against division opponents since he
last lost to the Giants on July 26, 2001. Schilling is 20-2 against
the NL West over the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter (12-7) gave up four hits, struck out seven, walked one and
hit a batter in 5 1/3 scoreless innings. The Diamondbacks didn't get
a runner to second base until the sixth inning.</TE>

<LD>Borzov Wins 100,</LD>
<LD>   Says He's Fastest</LD>
<LD>   Valery Borzov said he was sorry that U.S. sprinters weren't in
full force in the 100-meter final--Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson having
been disqualified in the second round the day before for arriving
late for the start--but believed he would have beaten them, anyway.
The only U.S. sprinter in the final, Robert Taylor, finished second
in 10.24 seconds to Borzov's 10.14.</LD>
<TE>   USC's Lennox Miller, of Jamaica, was third in 10.33.</TE>
<TE>   "At present, the American sprinters seem to have reached a point
of stagnation, while the European sprinters are making good
progress," Borzov said.</TE>

<TE>   Rick DeMont, 16, of San Rafael, Calif., won the men's 400-meter

when he was disqualified for failing a drug test. A banned substance
was contained in his asthma medication.</TE>

<HD>Ronaldo Heads to Real Madrid</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Real Madrid said Saturday it had signed Brazilian star striker
Ronaldo from Inter Milan.</LD>
<LD>   In a short statement, the soccer club said Ronaldo will arrive in
Madrid on Monday. More details from the club were expected later.</LD>
<LD>   Inter confirmed the deal on its Web site, but did not give any
details either.</LD>
<TE>   Spanish news reports said the Spanish powerhouse will pay $34.6
million for the transfer of one of the world's leading strikers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the deal reportedly includes the transfer of an
undetermined Madrid player to Inter, although the player will not
move to Italy until January. The report valued the total deal at
$44.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the Ronaldo deal late Saturday, Inter also confirmed
that it had acquired Argentine striker Hernan Crespo.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo reportedly wanted to leave Italy due to difficult
relations with Inter's Argentine Coach Hector Cuper, among other
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Upon returning to Spain, Ronaldo will join one of the most
talented clubs in the sport. Real's roster already features such
international stars as France's Zinedine Zidane, Portugal's Luis
Figo, Brazil's Roberto Carlos and Spain's Raul Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Gene Sauers shot a five-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke lead
after the third round of the Air Canada Championship at Surrey,
British Columbia. The 40-year-old Sauers, who won the last of his two
PGA Tour titles in 1989 and hasn't had a full tour card since 1996,
had a 13-under 200 total.</TE>
<TE>   Australians Peter Lonard and Robert Allenby were a stroke back
after 68s.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Mi Hyun Kim pitched in for eagle on the 17th hole
for a share of the third-round lead with France's Patricia
Meunier-Labouc in the State Farm Classic at Springfield, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, the 1999 tournament winner who is seeking her third victory
of the year, shot a four-under 68 to match Meunier-Labouc (72) at
13-under 203 on the Rail Golf Course. Kim holed a an eight iron from
106 yards for the eagle on the 355-yard 17th hole.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa's John Bland had a hole-in-one in a tournament-record
eight-under 63 to take the second-round lead in the Allianz
Championship at West Des Moines, Iowa. Bland used a five-iron to ace
the 175-yard 16th, and made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole
for an 11-under 131 total and a two-stroke lead over Bob Gilder.</TE>

<TE>   Jeff Burton won the rain-shortened Gatorade 200 at Darlington,
S.C. The race was stopped 300 yards from the halfway point of the
event, just short enough to stop it from being an official event. But
after an hour wait, the event was finally called and the pace car led
the field over the line.</TE>
<TE>   It was Burton's third-straight Busch series win at Darlington.
Jason Keller finished second, Jeff Green was third and was followed
by Busch series points leader Greg Biffle and Jack Sprague.</TE>
<TE>   Rain has washed out most of the on-track activities at Darlington
this week, with qualifying for both the Busch race and today's
Winston Cup event being called off.</TE>

<HD>Brady's Bunch Could Be Super</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before we all sit down to a new football season, here's a take on the
most recent NFL title game--a view that repairs the record, I'd
say--varying, as this does, from the national perception:</LD>
<LD>   * The notion that the St. Louis Rams' offense was beaten by the
New England Patriots' defense last winter in Super Bowl XXXVI is
false. Although it was a 17-3 game for three quarters, it was 17-17
in the fourth.</LD>
<LD>   * The notion that New England's Bill Belichick should be ranked
now as a great head coach is false. After Belichick's defense
collapsed in the Super Bowl's fourth quarter, he was saved by his
young quarterback, Tom Brady, whose aggressive passing in the last 90
seconds drove the Patriots to the last-snap field goal that won it,
20-17.</LD>
<TE>   * The notion that a great defense can beat a great offense in a
big game is false. By the fourth quarter of the Ram-Patriot struggle,
the momentum had passed to the Rams, who, both benches understood,
would hold the edge in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Before it came to that, however, the game was won in regulation by
the New England offense, which was more effective than any other 2001
offense whenever Brady was authorized to throw the ball. That was the
rub. In the Super Bowl, he got the authority just in time.</TE>
<TE>   Afraid to Throw</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots' problem until the last 90 seconds of 2001, in other
words, was the coach's fear of the thrown ball--Belichick's fear that
Brady was more likely to pass for interceptions than first downs or
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   And that is precisely their problem once more in 2002 with the
start of a new season this week.</TE>
<TE>   They're still the AFC's best--the NFL's best whenever Brady is
throwing two thirds of the time, or thereabouts. And accordingly, if
Belichick wants the Patriots to be a passing team this season they'll
win their second consecutive Super Bowl next Jan. 26 at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But all last season and again this summer, most of the time, they
were a running team, with Brady usually handing off. And to win the
NFL as a running team, the Patriots will need more luck than they'll
ever get again.</TE>
<TE>   Most obviously, in the playoffs last winter, they were lucky
against Oakland in the tucked-ball snowstorm and then Pittsburgh,
leading Steeler fans to predict that Pittsburgh will blow out New
England in the new season's first Monday night game on Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Belichick, judging between Brady and veteran starter
Drew Bledsoe after Bledsoe returned from injury, knew enough about
offense to play Brady. He just didn't know enough to use him until
there was no other option. And for the Patriots, that proved all but
fatal in Super Bowl XXXVI.</TE>
<TE>   By waiting to green-light Brady until only 90 seconds remained,
Belichick was taking an unpardonable gamble. He risked game and
season on the premise that he could win a Super Bowl with his
defensive team--a group that failed him ultimately--and with a
running game on offense. That group failed him too.</TE>
<TE>   Brady Not Alone</TE>
<TE>   Belichick's Super Bowl gamble was unnecessary. That was his crime.
By game time, he had to have been aware of Brady's remarkable talent.
He knew--he had to have known--that his young quarterback could
proceed profitably in the first and second quarters the way he played
the last 90 seconds, throwing pass after pass after pass after pass.</TE>
<TE>   Picture the New England team if its offensive players had played
Ram-type football that day: On defense, the Patriots would have shut
down Ram quarterback Kurt Warner, of course, as they did, for 45
minutes. On offense, Brady would have thrown on first down
repeatedly, and often on second down--in the tradition of Warner or
Joe Montana--for 45 minutes. And with 15 minutes to play, Belichick's
in front not by 17-3 but by what? Would you say 30-3? Maybe more.</TE>
<TE>   It is worth noting that as the NFL's 83rd season commences, many
teams have the personnel for Ram-type football. What they lack is the
right coaching: the right strategic awareness and-or courage on their
coaching staffs.</TE>
<TE>   If Warner and Brady can drive a passing machine--if they've found
it easier and more productive to complete passes on first and 10 than
third and anything--so would Aaron Brooks, Peyton Manning, Steve
McNair, Donovan McNabb, Kordell Stewart, Jeff Garcia, Jim Miller,
Mark Brunell, Drew Brees, Jay Fiedler and Tim Couch--not to mention,
among others, Tampa's best quarterback, Shaun King, and perhaps even
one of the Johnsons there.</TE>
<TE>   Five Perfect Shots</TE>
<TE>   Is Brady really that good? Well, in the 2001-2 season, he was. At
age 24, a 220-pound second-year pro standing 6 feet 4, he wasn't
throwing wild, fluky passes in the Super Bowl. He never does. Passing
on every down as time ran out on Belichick, Brady was performing with
the poise and manifest talent of a 10-year veteran. Each of his five
winning passes was well-calculated and perfectly launched.</TE>
<TE>   All last year, the NFL saw only one other thing like it: In that
New England blizzard when Oakland was there for the playoffs, Brady,
throwing on nearly every play, completed 18 of his last 19 passes to
eject the Raiders, 16-13.</TE>
<TE>   In the swirling snow that night, what the rest of us didn't know
about Brady was that he could throw that effectively in game
pressure. But Belichick had to have known. He'd seen him in many
games--and in practice every day.</TE>
<TE>   After two years as his coach, Belichick must by then have been
aware of the things that make Brady what he is: his character,
intelligence, instincts, fortitude, zeal for the game and greed for
the ball in high-pressure situations--not to mention the guy's
talent.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, as superbly as Brady played in 2001-2 whenever granted
the opportunity, Belichick needed the last 90 seconds of that long
season to upset the Rams. What if he hadn't had 90 seconds?</TE>
<TE>   Rams Getting Stronger</TE>
<TE>   Suppose only a minute remained when the Rams scored the Super
Bowl's tying touchdown. That could easily have happened, and that,
surely, would have led to overtime, and what then?</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. The Patriots were losing control in the fourth
quarter. The Ram offense was finally playing like the Ram offense The
New England defense was absolutely worn out, which is why a great
head coach would never try to beat a bunch like the Rams with a
defensive team. As the players all say, it's much more exhausting to
play defense than offense. Thus the Rams' long, three-play, Super
Bowl-tying touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that day was the
simplest and swiftest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   More of the same, exactly, was coming in overtime, and every
player on the field knew it. For the Ram way under Mike Martz is to
go for it. Martz is still the NFL's most modern and most-aware coach,
which leaves one question: Had New England won the overtime toss,
would Belichick have ordered Brady to go for it too? On this coach's
long record, the answer, sports fans, is no. The Belichick way is to
play defense and play for the breaks. Unless, providentially, 90
seconds remain.</TE>
<TE>   As the 2002 season starts, it's all up to Belichick again. If he's
learned that throwing the ball is the future of football, his passer
will win him another championship. If he can't conquer his urge to
win conservatively with defense and a running-play offense, he won't
make it.</TE>

<LD>Close your eyes and it could have been Horry.</LD>
<LD>   Look up into the swirling confetti and it could have been June.</LD>
<LD>   Joke all you want about Spark players who consistently suffer from
comparison to their high-flying Laker flatmates--and we've heard them
all--but give them this:</LD>
<TE>   While they may not have the hops, they certainly have the guts.</TE>
<TE>   With the clock dying and the score tied and a WNBA championship at
risk Saturday at Staples Center, rookie Nikki Teasley nervously
gripped the ball beyond the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   Eight, seven, six ...</TE>
<TE>   She wanted to pass to Lisa Leslie, but the star was covered. She
wanted to penetrate, but the lanes were filled.</TE>
<TE>   Five, four, three ...</TE>
<TE>   Out of options, but somehow not out of belief, she calmly stepped
back and did what many men who have come through here in recent years
would not.</TE>
<TE>   She took the shot.</TE>
<TE>   She took it even though she had missed her other four three-point
shots in this game, missed 17 of 21 in this series, and could not
even make one in her dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "After practice, I'll dribble around and act like I'm taking that
last-second shot," she said. "Problem is, I never make it."</TE>
<TE>   She took it even though veteran Teresa Weatherspoon of the New
York Liberty was so convinced she wouldn't, Weatherspoon backed away
to help guard Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long shot," Weatherspoon said.</TE>
<TE>   She took it because that's what great athletes do, no matter what
gender, no matter how many are watching.</TE>
<TE>   And she swished it. Of course she swished it. Doesn't such nutty
boldness always swish it?</TE>
<TE>   With 2.4 seconds remaining, Teasley's shot gave the Sparks their
second consecutive WNBA championship with a 69-66 victory and
two-game sweep of the Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   And then, yeah, it sounded like Horry.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the roof came down," said DeLisha Milton.</TE>
<TE>   The 13,493 fans erupted in a press table-rattling roar. Teasley
ran across the floor screaming, yet no one could hear her.</TE>
<TE>   Several Sparks collapsed at midcourt in tears. They later bounced
and hugged and danced back to the locker room, where waiting for them
were ring pops and plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   The ring pops, which many of them slurped during postgame
interviews, were representative of their second championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   The plastic bags were for their hair.</TE>
<TE>   You know, so the champagne wouldn't ruin it.</TE>
<TE>   It was a different sort of celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Born of a universal sort of shot.</TE>
<TE>   "You see it all the time in that situation, people have that big
shot, but they hesitate, look around, don't do anything," said
Milton.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, haven't folks around here seen it happen to everyone on the
Portland Trail Blazers, and everyone on the Sacramento Kings but that
Bibby guy?</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't think a rookie would be capable of that," Milton
said. "But she's not like a rookie. She's, like, old and wise."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, 23, who came here from Portland in a controversial
draft-day trade that sent away local favorite Ukari Figgs, has faced
many shots like that.</TE>
<TE>   While in college at North Carolina, she suffered from depression
that reached such depths, she left school for a year to live at home,
and work in a department store, and answer to a different first name.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this time that she had her tongue pierced and a
diamond-studded purple die inserted.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling myself not to crap out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't. While trying to lose herself, she found herself, and
returned to North Carolina to become one of the top players in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   And now, she's the author of the most dramatic shot in the Sparks'
short history.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, I'm going to watch it again," she said. "I'm going to
run home and put it in the VCR tonight."</TE>
<TE>   She might want to fast forward through the rest of the game. It
wasn't classic basketball.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the aging Liberty kicked it around like a group of
soccer moms. The Sparks led by nine points with 2:46 remaining, but
fumbled it away.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always exciting. It wasn't very attractive. The women's
game may never be big in a place that understandably appreciates
basketball only on its most dazzling levels.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of the afternoon Saturday, one could brush off the
confetti and admit it was fun.</TE>
<TE>   There is still room in this city's sports landscape for fun, isn't
there? There is room for the families and women's sports fans who
filled the lower bowl of the arena, isn't there?</TE>
<TE>   And surely, there is room for what could be the best women's
basketball team in history.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Houston Comets won four consecutive WNBA championships
before these Sparks went back to back. But the league was not as deep
or talented or experienced in those first seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, the Sparks have gone 117-32, including 6-0
in this year's playoffs and 12-1 in the last two postseasons.</TE>
<TE>   "R-E-S-P-E-C-T!" they sang as they slid across the
plastic-covered, champagne-soaked floor of their locker room late
Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   They should no longer feel a need to spell it out.</TE>

<HD>Bittersweet Victories for Zapedzki and Lusis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Munich Olympic organizers campaigned for their Games by pushing the
spirit of healing from World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Two defending gold medalists arrived in Munich bearing ugly scars
from the war.</LD>
<LD>   The fathers of Poland shooter Jozef Zapedzki, a 43-year-old major
in his country's army, and Soviet Union javelin thrower Janis Lusis,
33, were killed.</LD>
<TE>   Zapedzki's father died in a German concentration camp in Dachau.
Lusis' father, Voldemars, was executed in his home country of Latvia
by Russian soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   After Zapedzki won his second consecutive gold medal in a
well-contested 25-meter rapid-fire pistol event, he made the 12-mile
drive to Dachau and placed a wreath at the grave of his father, who
had died in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hardly find a Polish family not affected by the invasions
of the Nazis on Sept. 1, 1939, and the Russians on Sept. 17," said
Roman Czarny, deputy consul general of the Polish Consul in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Lusis' father was killed May 14, 1945, five days after Russia
declared victory over Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Russian soldiers demanding community support for a rebuilding
campaign in the former independent republic of Latvia came upon the
countryside home belonging to Voldemars Lusis, a 44-year-old cultural
technician responsible for the building of roads and bridges.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to take some things away from our home, things like
horses, pigs," Janis Lusis said.</TE>
<TE>   "These were robberies. My father fought that. He tried to stop
them."</TE>
<TE>   A Russian soldier executed Lusis by gunshot.</TE>
<TE>   Janis Lusis was 6 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In Munich 27 years later, Lusis said his anger toward the Russian
military was repressed by his enthusiasm for athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the best at what I did," Lusis said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he finished with a silver medal after losing by less than an
inch to a German, Klaus Wolfermann.</TE>
<TE>   Lusis, 63, now coaches javelin throwers at the Latvian National
Sports School.</TE>
<TE>   He competed in four Olympics (1964-76) and is the only man in his
country with a complete set of medals, owning the 1968 gold, a 1964
bronze and the 1972 silver.</TE>
<TE>   His son, also named Voldemars, was a javelin entrant in the 2000
Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact Zapedzki, 73, through the Polish Olympic
Committee and Polish Consul were not answered. Janusz Tatera,
secretary general of the Polish Olympic Committee, said Zapedzki is
retired living in a country home without a telephone and has not
participated in the last two annual meetings of Polish Olympians, an
event that typically draws large crowds of medalists.</TE>

<HD>Florida's Zook Wins His Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ron Zook era at sixth-ranked Florida got off to a shining start
with a 51-3 victory over Alabama Birmingham on Saturday at
Gainesville, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Just like the guy he replaced--new Washington Redskin Coach Steve
Spurrier--Zook knows Rex Grossman, Taylor Jacobs and Earnest Graham
have the ability to make any coach look brilliant.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobs had 246 receiving yards to break the school single-game
record of 237, set by Carlos Alvarez in 1969. The mark had stood as
one of only a handful not rewritten during Spurrier's 12 seasons as
coach.</LD>
<TE>   "This game was bigger for me than any of the other games are going
to be," Jacobs said. "A lot of people didn't think me, or the rest of
the receivers, could do anything."</TE>
<TE>   Grossman passed for 337 yards and two touchdowns and Graham ran
for 182 yards and two touchdowns. It marked the first time the Gators
have had a 150-yard rusher and a 200-yard receiver in a game.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Georgia 31, Clemson 28--Backup quarterback D.J. Shockley ran
for one touchdown and passed for another as the Bulldogs rallied to
win at Athens, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Bennett kicked a 43-yard field goal with 5:19 remaining to
break a 28-28 tie. Clemson's Aaron Hunt missed a 46-yard field-goal
with 1:43 remaining that would have tied the score and probably
forced overtime.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Tennessee 47, Wyoming 7--Casey Clausen threw for 238 yards
and a touchdown as the Volunteers won their eighth consecutive opener
and 16th consecutive nonconference game, at Nashville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 South Carolina 34, New Mexico State 24--Lou Holtz tied
former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler with the 234th victory of his
career, but the Gamecocks struggled throughout in a
less-than-impressive victory at Columbia, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi 31, Louisiana Monroe 3--Although quarterback Eli
Manning struggled, completing 17 of 31 passes for 192 yards, Robert
Williams came through for the Rebels, rushing for 100 yards and two
touchdowns at Oxford, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 39, Middle Tennessee 34--Tyler Watts passed for 236 yards
and two touchdowns and Freddie Roach returned a late interception for
a score as the Crimson Tide, which charged to a 22-0 lead, held off
the Blue Raiders at Birmingham, Ala.</TE>

<LD>The Houston Texans will open the season in a new $449-million stadium
next Sunday night on national TV in a game against the Dallas
Cowboys, while L.A. begins year No. 8 without an NFL team in our
backyard.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Q: What would have happened had the NFL awarded an expansion
franchise to Michael Ovitz instead of Houston's Bob McNair on Oct. 6,
1999?</LD>
<TE>   a) By now a business-troubled Ovitz would have sold and moved the
team to San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   b) The season opener in L.A. would have to be blacked out locally
because of low ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   c) Fans entering the Rose Bowl for the first game would have been
beaten to a pulp by Raider fans still waiting for their team to
return.</TE>
<TE>   d) Los Angeles would have one more Carr, and would be thrilled
about it.</TE>
<TE>   A: d. Rookie quarterback David Carr, married, father, handsome,
articulate and armed with talent, would already be one of L.A.'s most
popular athletes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What would the name of L.A.'s football team be right now?</TE>
<TE>   a) The Los Angeles Stars (represented by Ovitz), or the SROs for
short.</TE>
<TE>   b) The San Antonio Stars.</TE>
<TE>   c) The Spidermen.</TE>
<TE>   d) The Future Inmates.</TE>
<TE>   A: c. Trick question. Had Tampa Bay accepted a deal from Hollywood
Park to move here in 1995, the Bucs were going to change their name
to the Spidermen. By this time, Hollywood Park would have already
hosted at least one Super Bowl. The land there is now going to be
used to build a strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What did L.A. lose when the NFL awarded the team to Houston?</TE>
<TE>   a) Super Bowl XXXVIII to be played on Feb. 1, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   b) A monument, in the form of a wall, listing the 12,518 charter
members who purchased personal seat licenses for Houston's new
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   c) Tom Cruise throwing a football around with Penelope Cruz in
warmups.</TE>
<TE>   d) Cruz throwing a football around with the Page 2 columnist in
warmups.</TE>
<TE>   A: All of the above. Houston received Super Bowl XXXVIII because
McNair gave NFL owners $700 million to divide. The sale of $50
million in personal seat licenses helped defray the cost of McNair's
new playpen, and in return he put the fans' names on a wall so
everyone in Houston knows just who the suckers are. Cruise was going
be one of Ovitz's co-owners, reportedly now basing "Mission:
Impossible 3" on the chances of getting local fans interested in the
return of the NFL and Cruz throwing a football to the Page 2
columnist under any circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would life be different in L.A. if we had an NFL team?</TE>
<TE>   a) Football fans might not care as much about a Sparks' victory
parade.</TE>
<TE>   b) Spidermen games might conflict with Dodger-Angel World Series.</TE>
<TE>   c) Mark Ridley-Thomas might be left speechless.</TE>
<TE>   d) Mayor Jim Hahn would be seen wearing Brian Urlacher's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   A: d. The No. 1 selling jersey in the NFL is No. 54--belonging to
Urlacher, a linebacker for the Bears--and that's how out of touch we
are with the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Bob Walker, the race and sports director at the MGM and Mirage
in Las Vegas, puts the odds at 150-1 that Houston wins the Super Bowl
this year, so wouldn't we be better off with a team moving here?</TE>
<TE>   a) The Chargers are 45-1 coming off an eight-game losing streak
with a quarterback who has made one NFL appearance in his career.</TE>
<TE>   b) The Saints are 28-1, the Bills 30-1, the Vikings 28-1, the
Cardinals 55-1, the Colts 12-1--and for some reason they all look
better on DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   c) The Raiders are 14-1 and waiting for Darrell Russell to return.</TE>
<TE>   d) USC and UCLA are each 45-1 to win the bowl championship series
with the Bruins the 2-1 choice to have the first player hauled off in
handcuffs this season during a game.</TE>
<TE>   A: None of the above. Looking at these numbers, football brings
only misery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some team is still going to try to move here, but which one?</TE>
<TE>   a) The Chargers can trigger an escape clause in their lease
beginning in December for 90 days, and every December, but only once
every three years.</TE>
<TE>   b) The Rose Bowl's hiring of John Moag suggests the NFL already
has a team in mind to move to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   c) The San Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   d) Who has Casey Wasserman's telephone number?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know, and that's my final answer. I look for the
Chargers to wait another year before exercising their escape clause,
which would start the small-city panic in San Diego a year from this
December. Wasserman is tight with Charger management and there are
rumors he might be interested in Transamerica Building land for a new
stadium, but he's going to need big-time help from someone like Ron
Burkle. Tim LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke has run into some tennis
problems at Cal State Dominguez Hills and never got the OK from boss
Philip Anschutz to pursue football. That prompted the NFL to call
Moag, which is significant. That tells me the either the Saints,
Colts or Chargers are hot to trot, and the league wants a viable
option in L.A. to avoid the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   My longshot choice has always been San Francisco--given the logjam
of two Bay Area teams, the 49ers' stadium problems, the DeBartolo
family breakup, and my personal aversion to having the Spanos Goofs,
who own the Chargers, follow in the footsteps of Al Davis and Georgia
Frontiere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the meantime, while the stadium game goes on and we watch
TV, who makes it to the Super Bowl in San Diego at the end of this
season?</TE>
<TE>   a) St. Louis (7 to 2) versus Pittsburgh (13 to 2).</TE>
<TE>   b) Philadelphia (15 to 2) versus New England (8 to 1).</TE>
<TE>   c) Tampa (8 to 1) versus Miami (12 to 1).</TE>
<TE>   d) Washington (10 to 1) versus Tennessee (18 to 1).</TE>
<TE>   A: c. Ricky Williams returns to San Diego, where he went to high
school, and races off with Super Bowl MVP trophy before being stopped
by the CHP, asked to remove his helmet and then given a ticket for
speeding again.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Are Ringmasters Again</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Teasley's three-pointer with 2.4 seconds left gives
L.A. 69-66 win over Liberty, completing 6-0 postseason run to team's
second straight league title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 32 regular-season games and five playoff games, Spark rookie
Nikki Teasley did everything asked of her--except shoot.</LD>
<LD>   Teasley, the fifth player taken in the WNBA's April draft by
Portland and traded to Los Angeles for veteran guard Ukari Figgs, was
determined to fit in with the defending WNBA champions. She always
made sure everyone got shots before she did.</LD>
<LD>   But on Saturday, with Game 2 of the WNBA Finals tied and less than
three seconds to play, the ball was in Teasley's hands. Her teammates
and 13,493 in Staples Center were imploring her to shoot.</LD>
<TE>   And Teasley, who had missed her previous four three-point
attempts, sank a three-pointer from 21 feet away with 2.4 seconds
left to give Los Angeles a rousing 69-66 title-clinching win over the
New York Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   The basket secured the Sparks' second consecutive WNBA
championship. They join Houston as the only multiple titleholders in
the league's six-year history, and equaled the 2000 Comets' WNBA
record of sweeping all six playoff games. Include the final three
regular-season games and Los Angeles won its last nine, equaling its
longest winning streak of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley could not have picked a better way to vindicate the faith
Coach Michael Cooper and General Manager Penny Toler showed in
trading for her. The final shot, she said, "was just instinct. I
looked for the play [under the basket to Lisa Leslie] and it wasn't
there. The second option was for me to shoot. This time I had an open
look and thank God I knocked it down.</TE>
<TE>   "I could never have imagined taking the last shot, not in a
million years," said Teasley, who had 11 points and 11 assists. "I
know the trade was devastating to the fans because Ukari is a
wonderful person. But this is a business; you have to take what you
get and move on. I wish her the best but I'm gonna try and keep my
job and keep trying to do what I do best."</TE>
<TE>   Getting swept in the best-of-three series was yet another bitter
Finals finish for the Liberty. This was the fourth time in six years
New York has tried to win the WNBA title, and the fourth time New
York has failed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heartbreaking loss for us," Liberty Coach Richie Adubato
said. "I am very proud of my team. They had a great year. They won
the Eastern Conference, coming on late in the season. They beat a lot
of great teams to get here. I really thought we were going to do it
the hard way. I thought we were going to win today, and I thought it
would have been a tremendous championship game tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tamika Whitmore, who along with teammate Vickie Johnson led
New York with 17 points. "I'm sick of coming up short. Some things
you just don't have an answer for. All things happen for a reason,
but I guess it's just not meant for us to win yet."</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Weatherspoon, who darted back and forth between Teasley and
Leslie in the final seconds before Teasley launched the game winner,
could only shake her head.</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to be the one defending it," Weatherspoon said. "I was
kind of trying to pick my poison, playing in between. If I could do
it all over again I would do it differently. But she made a good
shot."</TE>
<TE>   For the other Sparks, it was an incredible finish to a season--and
a game--that tested them in ways they had not imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried on this," said Latasha Byears, who contributed 10 points
and 11 rebounds Saturday. "This year was so hard.... And Nikki ... I
can't even describe that shot. I had to let some tears out."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, who had 17 points and was named Finals MVP for a second
straight year, said, "This game was like our year. We've been in
situations where we've been up, teams have come back, teams have gone
ahead, we have to do it with our defense, and we have to hit big
shots. [The last shot] was evidence [of] how much faith we had in
Nikki, who's been a great addition to our team."</TE>
<TE>   If the Sparks had lost Saturday, they could have blamed
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They broke out to an 18-4 lead, but New York closed to within
26-24 with 3:14 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks led, 31-24, at the half, then scored seven straight
points to begin the second half and waited for the Liberty to go
away. Instead, New York responded with an 18-3 run to take its only
lead, 42-41. Los Angeles built its lead back to nine, 66-57, but the
Liberty scored nine in a row to tie the score, the last two coming on
a 15-footer by Tari Phillips with 18.2 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to Teasley to take a shot at victory. She made it her
best shot.</TE>
<TE>   A victory rally for the Sparks will be staged Tuesday at the
Hollywood-Highland mall, starting at 11:30 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Good Will, Tennis From Hewitt</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: Top-ranked player beats Blake in five sets,
replacing last year's controversy with display of sportsmanship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This, as it turned out, was a sequel not with a snarl, but with a
smile.</LD>
<LD>   Quite simply, James Blake had to laugh after watching Lleyton
Hewitt scurry across the court, again, to make another improbable
retrieval.</LD>
<LD>   The good will had legs. After all, it took Hewitt an hour and 24
minutes to unleash a trademark ear-splitting "Come on-n-n!!" after
breaking Blake's serve for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Later, in the fourth set, one of Blake's forehand winners whipped
across the court and Hewitt stunned the crowded house with his
response. The toughest, fiercest of competitors acknowledged the shot
by clapping his racket. And after his 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3
third-round victory against Blake at the U.S. Open on Saturday, they
exchanged pats on the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Though these are universal gestures, they are not usually found in
Hewitt's arsenal. Mutual admiration during an athletic contest isn't
part of the script in his beloved "Rocky" movies.</TE>
<TE>   An exorcism of sorts came down at Arthur Ashe Stadium. For 3 hours
and 34 minutes, the defending champion and No. 1-seeded Hewitt and
Blake traded good will and groundstrokes.</TE>
<TE>   If the high quality of play didn't completely erase the bitterness
of their match here last year, in which Hewitt made a remark thought
to carry racial overtones, then Blake made sure he let Hewitt know he
had moved on.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth game of the fourth set, with Hewitt serving at 3-4,
a female fan was heard to shout, "James, don't let him beat you, he's
a racist."</TE>
<TE>   The words, which came from behind Blake, made him turn around. In
that game, Hewitt lost his serve by double faulting for only the
fourth time in the match. Blake then held at love to push it to a
fifth set, in which the decisive break came in the sixth game when
Blake played a series of loose shots, dropping his serve at love.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the fourth set stayed with Blake when they shook
hands, and he apologized to Hewitt for the fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I just apologized for any fans that were speaking out
negatively," Blake said. "That's something that I was embarrassed by
when a few fans did that. I hope that you guys [reporters] would
treat him better this year, as well."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the 22-year-old Blake seems to have an uncanny sense
about his role, almost in the mold of the late Ashe. Hewitt helped
Blake make his name in last year's epic second-round match, and
suddenly there was another top young American other than Andy
Roddick. For his part, Blake helped Hewitt get back his name by
taking the high road.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a nice guy, no doubt about that," Hewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone knows that. I say a lot of 'good shots' to a lot
of opponents. It's not just because I'm playing James out there.
Maybe he hits more good shots than some other guys I play.</TE>
<TE>   "To see us not give an inch the whole match for three and a half
hours to four hours, I think it's something we can both be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Said Blake: "We both laid it on the line. We fought our hearts out
till the end....</TE>
<TE>   "The way we conducted ourselves, I really like the fact that if
any kid was watching that, they could say, 'I want to be like either
of those two.' That's good for the game of tennis. I'm glad I was
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt approached the Blake match like a Davis Cup adventure in
hostile territory. He had only a couple of brief lapses in
concentration, most notably losing a 5-2 lead in the first-set
tiebreaker and double faulting at 5-5 to give Blake a set point,
which he converted.</TE>
<TE>   Their electric third-round match was the highlight on an otherwise
ordinary day. Defending champion and No. 2 Venus Williams has lost
six games in three matches, three of them in a 6-1, 6-2 victory over
Martina Muller of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The only concern the Williams family seems to have these days is
the German man who has been stalking Serena. He was arrested in the
early hours Saturday morning, apprehended by police when he was
spotted looking for Williams through a fence at the National Tennis
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, No. 6 Andre Agassi was in devastating form. Agassi
defeated Ramon Delgado of Paraguay, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, in 91 minutes in
the third round. He has dropped 16 games in nine sets.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-seeded Monica Seles, a sentimental favorite, came close to
losing to a 23-year-old qualifier from South Korea ranked No. 106 in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Seles held a 6-1, 5-1 lead against Yoon-Joeng Cho, dropped seven
straight games to lose the second set and trailed, 1-0, in the third
before rallying to win, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   "My brain went away from the court," Seles said.</TE>

<HD>Nice Coaches Finish ...</HD>
<DH>UCLA's Toledo prefers to use velvet touch, but his trust
has been betrayed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most pressing question surrounding UCLA has everything to do with
Coach Bob Toledo, but nothing to do with his knowledge of Xs and O's.</LD>
<LD>   It's not about rankings, predictions or bowl games.</LD>
<LD>   It has nothing to do with whether the Bruins, in Toledo's seventh
season, finish first or last.</LD>
<TE>   Rather, it's this: Can a nice guy finish at all?</TE>
<TE>   Are college football players so self-absorbed and untrustworthy
that they will continue to brazenly take advantage of a good-natured,
benevolent coach until he is fired because of their defiance?</TE>
<TE>   The perpetually sunny Toledo seems as unthreatening as cartoon
character SpongeBob SquarePants. His players profess to appreciate
the absence of an iron fist, yet repeatedly cross him, engaging in
off-the-field behavior that embarrasses UCLA and undermines the
team's ability to play to its potential.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest last week of All-American candidate Ricky Manning Jr.
on felony assault charges is merely the latest in a series of Bruin
transgressions that includes NCAA violations, criminal acts and
several vicious single-punch knockouts at bars and parties.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo finally seems to realize he has been sucker punched once
too often. The next blow might knock him into the unemployment line.</TE>
<TE>   "The morning after Ricky's arrest I let the team know I was very
upset," he said. "You might say I invoked the fear factor. I would be
very surprised if anything else happens that embarrasses the
program."</TE>
<TE>   Early in Toledo's tenure his policy was to suspend a player if a
police report indicated culpability in a fight. He decided to become
more lenient after a 1998 incident in which he suspended running back
Jermaine Lewis for one game for taking part in a fraternity fracas
only to discover later that defensive back Eric Whitfield was
actually the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   "I acted hastily without knowing all the facts," Toledo said. "We
reevaluated the policy and decided to suspend a player when he is
convicted of a misdemeanor and dismiss him when convicted of a
felony."</TE>
<TE>   A rash of suspensions followed early in the 1999 season when 19
current and former players were convicted of fraudulently using
handicapped-parking placards.</TE>
<TE>   Back-to-back crises derailed a promising season a year ago.
Heisman Trophy candidate DeShaun Foster broke NCAA rules by driving a
car that didn't belong to him and was suspended for four games.
Quarterback Cory Paus did not inform Toledo of two convictions for
driving under the influence, which came to light before the USC game
and contributed to a 27-0 loss, one of the Bruins' most pathetic
performances in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Less public are subtle slights to the coach's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Bryan Fletcher, a model student and thoughtful leader
last season, knew that Foster was jeopardizing his eligibility by
driving the Ford Expedition provided to him by Hollywood director
Eric Laneuville. Yet Fletcher gave Foster a lift to the Ford
dealership to pick up the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In July, offensive linemen John Ream and Collin Barker announced
they were retiring for medical reasons without conferring with the
coach, who knew the players had serious injuries but was unsure of
their plans.</TE>
<TE>   "That really ticked me off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barker, in fact, crossed paths with Toledo on campus a few days
before team physician Gerald Fineman signed papers making the
retirement official.</TE>
<TE>   "How you feeling, Collin?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fine, Coach, fine."</TE>
<TE>   No crime there, but where's the respect?</TE>
<TE>   No wonder an online search turned up 184 media references linking
"Bob Toledo" and "hot seat."</TE>
<TE>   Despite getting torpedoed time after time, Toledo steadfastly
backs his players, who apparently see nothing to fear behind his
hair-trigger laugh and golly-gee mannerisms. They believe their coach
is Dr. Jekyll without a trace of Mr. Hyde.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Toledo is someone you aren't afraid to talk to about
problems," senior cornerback Joe Hunter said. "He believes in second
chances and helps guys. Personally I appreciate that quality, but
over the years some guys have taken advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's forgiveness has bordered on the absurd. Paus was allowed
to play against USC despite his deceit--a move that backfired when
the quarterback threw for a career-low 45 yards and had two passes
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "When kids make a mistake you can't hold it against them for the
rest of their lives," Toledo said. "They are like sons. They make
mistakes. Sometimes you have to scold, sometimes you discipline them
and sometimes you have to get rid of them."</TE>
<TE>   Manning is one of three players whom Toledo has unwaveringly
supported in the face of serious charges stemming from fights.</TE>
<TE>   Asi Faoa, a junior defensive lineman, punched a student so
fiercely at a party two years ago that the victim suffered brain
damage. Faoa was charged with a felony, pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and lost a civil case, but has yet to serve his 180-day
sentence. Toledo suspended him for one game in 2000 and he is
expected to get substantial playing time this season.</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu, a freshman defensive lineman, faces felony battery
charges after allegedly punching a drive-in theater employee so hard
the victim suffered a broken jaw and nose. Niusulu is practicing with
the team and will not be suspended unless convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo dismissed senior Audie Attar from the team during the
summer only after giving the linebacker numerous chances. The last
straw was Attar breaking the nose of former UCLA quarterback Scott
McEwan's younger brother during a barroom fight.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 Attar punched Bruin baseball player Charles Merricks at a
Westwood restaurant and had been involved in other altercations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some players were privately indignant Attar was dismissed,
saying Toledo did so only because McEwan was a favorite of his. And
Foster was upset that Toledo publicly expressed disappointment in the
running back after the NCAA levied its suspension.</TE>
<TE>   As many parents know, avoiding responsibility for transgressions
is a common response of children, especially when excuses are
accepted for misbehavior and consequences are lacking. A child comes
to believe that anything goes. And when the parent finally lays down
the law, the child feels unjustly persecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, however, did not experience these problems raising his
three daughters, who view him as tough but fair.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew what my dad expected of us, and out of respect and love
for him, we knew we couldn't disappoint him, and we behaved," said
his daughter Christa Long, who lives with her husband and two
children near her parents in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want the wrath of dad. He expected a lot and had
old-fashioned standards."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter Alissa recalls a three-hour drive the family took
from College Station, Texas, to San Antonio to visit the Alamo when
she was in high school and Christa was home from college. The girls
were bickering in the back seat of the car.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad said, 'One more word and we are turning around,' " Alissa
said. "We made it all the way to the front of the Alamo and one of us
wanted to get in one last jab and said something. He pulled a U-turn
and drove back three hours without a word, dropped us off and took my
mom out to dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's daughters watch in dismay as his surrogate children--his
players--repeatedly defy him.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad has a passion for coaching football because he believes
college players are still coachable and teachable," Christa said. "He
likes to be a father figure. But obviously it can come back to bite
you when they stray.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how strong the father figure is, there are kids who do
things their own way even though direction and rules have been set.
That's obviously the case here. It hurts them and hurts my dad."</TE>
<TE>   Are college football players simply unruly children in bigger
bodies? Do they require a hard-nosed coach who motivates through fear
to keep them from lying, cheating and using their fists as lethal
weapons? Can a coach of Toledo's temperament succeed?</TE>
<TE>   The man who ultimately must decide, new UCLA Athletic Director Dan
Guerrero, wants to believe he can.</TE>
<TE>   "There are nice guys all over this profession," he said. "Clearly,
you don't have to be off the charts in terms of laying down the
hammer. Coaches get it done with a variety of styles. There is no
right or wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is to establish principles, don't
compromise them and teach student-athletes what it takes to be
successful on and off the field."</TE>
<TE>   The spate of problems has damaged Bruin efforts on the field. They
are 17-19 since opening the 1998 season 10-0 and seldom have been
able to focus solely on football.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps another potentially embarrassing problem has already
occurred and eventually will become public. Toledo refused to comment
on speculation that players besides Manning have been involved in
incidents that might result in arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to tell everyone any time something happens," he
said. "It's always a possibility."</TE>
<TE>   He is, however, reevaluating the policy he softened in 1998.
Perhaps the punishment should be as lethal as the punch, with a
suspension resulting long before the slow wheels of the criminal
justice system grind out a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Toledo realizes it's time to save his own skin.</TE>
<TE>   Then he reflects on why he supports Manning and has second
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor kid was trying to defend himself," he said. "People are
picking on our guys because they realize that I was suspending guys
and kicking them off the team. And because of their makeup they don't
walk away."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo was an assistant at Oregon and Texas A&amp;M before coming to
UCLA as offensive coordinator in 1994, and he finds himself longing
for the small-town atmosphere of Eugene, Ore., and College Station,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. isn't like Oregon or Texas A&amp;M, where the players pulled up
to the practice field in their pickup trucks," he said. "Here
everybody is spread out and they all go their own way at the end of
the day."</TE>
<TE>   So it comes back to the players, who might live to regret their
insubordination if it causes Toledo to be replaced by an unyielding
taskmaster.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's son-in-law, Brent Long, is a graduate of the Air Force
Academy. He recalls studying a commencement speech delivered by Civil
War Gen. John M. Scofield at West Point more than 100 years ago: "The
discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in
battle is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment."</TE>
<TE>   If true, then players must be accountable for their actions when
the coach has his back turned. The new Bruin advisory council made up
of nine players voted on by the team is a firm step in that
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had this last year, maybe Fletcher would have come to us
rather than thinking he only had a choice of being loyal to DeShaun
or running to Coach Toledo," one council member said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Bruins will recognize that a coach who backs them even
in the face of repeated betrayal and intense public scrutiny deserves
their respect.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't run off kids and he has shown he is there for you in
tough times," Hunter said. "He watches our backs. I think it's time
we did the same for him."</TE>

<HD>Going One Step at a Time</HD>
<DH>UCLA: Determined to avoid repeating last season's collapse,
Bruins are refusing to look beyond next game and are stressing unity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's revisionist history, but UCLA coaches and players say
problems last season began long before tailback DeShaun Foster and
quarterback Cory Paus went through their well-chronicled troubles.</LD>
<LD>   Enumerated on a chalkboard, they were disguised as those most
fundamental of motivational tools--team goals.</LD>
<LD>   No. 1 was to go undefeated. Next came a national championship.
After that, the Pacific 10 Conference title.</LD>
<TE>   Admirable and lofty aspirations all. So lofty, in fact, that they
became unattainable in a single afternoon, a 38-28 loss to Stanford
that ended a season-opening six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   To hear the current Bruins tell it, the 23 seniors promptly began
sizing up their NFL prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys started thinking about the next level as soon as it
was obvious we couldn't reach our goals," tackle Mike Saffer said.</TE>
<TE>   One loss soon became four in a row and even a season-ending
victory over Arizona State could not blunt the disappointment of a
7-4 record and no bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   A new season brings new goals. This time Coach Bob Toledo--not the
seniors--chose them. And they are decidedly more mundane.</TE>
<TE>   "Team unity and win the upcoming game," he said. "Those are our
only goals."</TE>
<TE>   A foundation for unity was established by conducting the first
week of training camp at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.
The setting was tranquil, distractions minimal.</TE>
<TE>   The blue skies didn't last long, though. Three days after
returning to Westwood, senior cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. was
arrested on felony assault charges. The cloud that hung over the
program the second half of last season was back.</TE>
<TE>   The only sure way to lift the gloom is to get off to a strong
start. A national magazine rated the UCLA schedule second in
difficulty only to USC's. According to preseason polls, Colorado is
the Bruins' only ranked nonconference opponent, so a 3-1 record
starting Pacific 10 Conference play is possible.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will be the last Division I-A team to open, Sept. 7,
when they play host to Colorado State, which played in the earliest
opener in major college history Aug. 22 and defeated Virginia, 35-29.
On Saturday, the Rams defeated Colorado, 19-14.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will be without all those seniors apparently afflicted with
attention-deficit disorder. But among them were some excellent
players, including All-American middle linebacker Robert Thomas,
Foster and starters in every other position group.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost a lot, but the cupboard is not bare," Toledo said. "We've
got a lot of good football players who have waited for an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   QUARTERBACK</TE>
<TE>   Paus is a fifth-year senior whose 2001 season mirrored that of the
team. He threw zero interceptions in the first six games--all
victories--then threw eight interceptions and zero touchdown passes
in the four losses. He says a thumb injury that nagged him all last
season is healed and he has exhibited clear-eyed leadership during
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson, a freshman from Piedmont, won the second-string job
with a strong camp. However, he has looked confused during full-speed
scrimmages and would have difficulty avoiding rookie mistakes should
he be thrust into a pressure situation.</TE>
<TE>   John Sciarra, a redshirt freshman whose father was a UCLA
quarterback in the 1970s, lacks big-time skills but has learned the
offense and is improved. Matt Moore, a freshman from Hart High,
probably will redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   RUNNING BACK</TE>
<TE>   The quick, elusive Akil Harris took over at tailback when Foster
was suspended and rushed for 375 yards, averaging 4.9 yards a carry
and finishing the season with a career-high 138 yards against Arizona
State.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 3, 240 pounds, Manuel White is a bruising runner listed
as the No. 1 fullback on the depth chart. He will also split time
with Harris at tailback. White is a good receiver and blocker who is
most effective close to the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   Three freshmen--Jason Harrison, Wendell Mathis and Tyler
Ebell--have impressed offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper. Harrison,
who can play tailback and fullback, is a fine receiver. Ebell,
although small, is perhaps the best breakaway threat.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Norton is a blocking specialist at fullback, although he has
been slowed because of an ankle injury. In a surprise, freshman J.D.
Groves beat out sophomore Ray Cassaday as backup fullback.</TE>
<TE>   RECEIVER</TE>
<TE>   Tab Perry, Craig Bragg and Ryan Smith form an experienced and
talented group. Perry is a big, fast NFL prototype flanker who
averaged 19.8 yards on 21 catches last season. Bragg is a fleet
multiple threat who led the team with 29 receptions and also gained
100 yards on reverses. Smith is a reliable possession receiver who
averaged 15.1 yards on 18 catches.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Junior Taylor has great potential. Senior Jon Dubravac
figures to contribute after sitting out last season because of a back
injury, and former walk-on Garrett Lepisto is a favorite of coaches.</TE>
<TE>   TIGHT END</TE>
<TE>   Senior Mike Seidman had a tremendous training camp and has become
the go-to receiver for Paus, who previously was reluctant to throw to
any tight end. Seidman can beat safeties on deep patterns and
out-wrestle linebackers on short routes.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Carter might sit out the first game because of an ankle
injury, but he is an excellent blocker certain to play in goal-line
and short-yardage situations. Freshman Marcedes Lewis is an
extraordinary talent who will line up at wide receiver as often as at
tight end.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSIVE LINE</TE>
<TE>   Tackles Saffer and Bryce Bohlander and guards Eyoseph Efseaff and
Steve Vieira are returning starters. Redshirt freshman Mike McCloskey
is the center and sophomore Paul Mociler is the top backup at all
three positions. Freshman tackle Alex Potasi and veteran guard Shane
Lehmann provide depth.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSIVE LINE</TE>
<TE>   There is depth and experience, although the ability to pressure
the quarterback is questionable. Tackle Rodney Leisle hasn't
practiced because of a tender knee but is expected to play against
Colorado State. That's important because he is projected as an
all-conference talent. Seniors Sean Phillips and Steve Morgan and
junior college transfer Ryan Boschetti are also good tackles. Ends
Dave Ball and Rusty Williams had strong training camps and are backed
up ably by Asi Faoa and Mat Ball.</TE>
<TE>   LINEBACKER</TE>
<TE>   Senior Marcus Reese, the fourth linebacker last year, steps into
the void left by Thomas. Reese is tough and mobile, but a recent
concussion has coaches concerned. Veteran Dennis Link and impressive
freshman Justin London provide depth in the middle. Brandon Chillar
is a returning starter on the strong side and Tim Warfield is a
quality backup. Redshirt freshman Spencer Havner has emerged as a
pleasant surprise on the weak side.</TE>
<TE>   SECONDARY</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins should be tough to pass against. Manning is one of the
nation's top cornerbacks and sophomore Matt Ware could develop into
one of the best free safeties. Senior Joe Hunter beat out sophomore
Matt Clark in a close race at the corner opposite Manning and a trio
of players with great potential will share time at strong
safety--sophomores Ben Emanuel and Jibril Raymo and freshman Jarrad
Page.</TE>
<TE>   SPECIAL TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   The kicking game is strong and the coverage units are suspect.
Nate Fikse led the Pac-10 with a 44.2 punting average last season and
senior kicker Chris Griffith has made 34 of 45 field-goal attempts
and missed only two of 112 extra-point attempts. The Bruins gave up
nearly 30 yards a kick return last season and were at the bottom of
the Pac-10 in punt returns.</TE>
<TE>   COACH</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is picked to finish sixth in the Pac 10 in a media poll,
which would allow the Bruins to slip into a bowl game. Coach Bob
Toledo can't afford anything less, not after going 17-19 since the
last regular-season game in 1998. His staff is intact from last
season. Offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper assists Toledo in calling
plays. Defensive coordinator Phil Snow made an immediate impact last
season, his first with the Bruins, and has had an authoritative voice
throughout training camp.</TE>

<DH>USC: Schedule, considered among toughest in country,
includes games against Auburn, Colorado, Kansas State and Notre Dame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A quirk in the calendar this year and next allowed college football
teams to schedule 12 games, instead of the usual 11.</LD>
<LD>   Like most schools, USC took advantage of the opportunity for
revenue and exposure. The Trojans, however, did themselves no
favor--they didn't line up a patsy.</LD>
<LD>   USC, ranked 20th in the Associated Press poll, plays what many
regard as one of the toughest schedules in the nation. It begins
Monday against Auburn of the powerful Southeastern Conference and
ends Nov. 30 against Notre Dame.</LD>
<TE>   Along the way, the Trojans travel to No. 7 Colorado and Kansas
State before beginning Pacific 10 Conference play on Sept. 28 against
Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   The following week, USC plays 12th-ranked Washington State at
Pullman, Wash. Two weeks later, the Trojans play host to No. 11
Washington before traveling to No. 15 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in games against California, Stanford, Arizona State and
UCLA, and the Trojans are playing a schedule that could break
them--or make them into contenders for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenging schedule, but we want to be challenged,"
senior quarterback Carson Palmer said. "That's the only way you get
better."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll went 6-6 last year in his first season with the
Trojans. USC started 1-4 before winning five of its last six
regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll hopes to avoid a similar start. But Auburn, Colorado and
Kansas State won't make that easy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're games that will get us prepared, one way or another, for
the Pac-10 race," Carroll said. "When we get to Oregon State, we'll
have been truly tested. I hope we're stronger for it."</TE>
<TE>   A position-by-position look at USC:</TE>
<TE>   QUARTERBACK</TE>
<TE>   Palmer bypassed the opportunity to turn pro and returned for a
chance to lead the Trojans to the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, he passed for 2,717 yards and 13 touchdowns with 12
interceptions. If he stays injury-free, he can establish school
records for completions and yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman Matt Leinart begins the season as the backup
because redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel chipped a bone in his right
kneecap during training camp. But the battle for the No. 2 spot is
likely to continue.</TE>
<TE>   RUNNING BACK</TE>
<TE>   Senior Justin Fargas began his injury-plagued career at Michigan
and wants to end it with a flourish at USC, but he will miss the
opener because of a strained right hamstring..</TE>
<TE>   Senior Sultan McCullough gained 1,163 yards two years ago and
finished as the team's leading rusher last season, even though he
missed six games because of an abdominal injury.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Malaefou MacKenzie, who sat out two seasons because of
serious injuries, is back for a sixth. He is an outstanding receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Hershel Dennis and sophomore Darryl Poston also will
play.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Chad Pierson and Sunny Byrd are experienced fullbacks and
will share time with freshman Brandon Hancock. Pierson will not play
against Auburn because of a strained left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   WIDE RECEIVER</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kareem Kelly will start for the fourth season and is within
range of school records for receptions and yards receiving. Junior
Keary Colbert caught 67 passes over the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Mattos and Jason Mitchell will contribute, but the player to
watch is 6-foot-5 freshman Mike Williams, who will back up Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   TIGHT END</TE>
<TE>   At 6-8, tight end Gregg Guenther is a big target who improved his
pass-catching ability and blocking during training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Holmes caught 22 passes and scored two touchdowns last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Dominique Byrd provides depth.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSIVE LINE</TE>
<TE>   An experienced unit gets a dose of fire with the addition of
freshman Fred Matua, who was scheduled to start the opener at right
guard in place of injured senior Zach Wilson. But Matua is
questionable because of a bruised knee.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Lenny Vandermade moved from center to left guard and junior
Norm Katnik, who played all three line positions last season, will
start at center. Juniors Jacob Rogers and Eric Torres are the
tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Derek Graf, sophomore Travis Watkins and senior Phillip
Eaves provide depth, along with freshman tackles Winston Justice,
Kyle Williams and guards Chris Doyle and Kurt Katnik.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSIVE LINE</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore tackle Shaun Cody and sophomore end Kenechi Udeze lead a
young but experienced unit.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Mike Patterson will start at nose tackle, but senior
Bernard Riley will get significant playing time. Junior Omar Nazel
will start at the other end.</TE>
<TE>   Junior college transfers Daniel Urquhart and Van Brown provide
depth.</TE>
<TE>   LINEBACKER</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Simmons, a transfer from Washington State, joins the mix at
weak-side linebacker and will start alongside senior Mike Pollard in
the middle and opposite sophomore Matt Grootegoed.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard underwent off-season knee surgery and Grootegoed is coming
back from a broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Aaron Graham will back up Simmons, sophomore Lee Webb and
freshman Oscar Lua will spell Pollard, and 6-5 freshman Dallas Sartz
backs up Grootegoed.</TE>
<TE>   SECONDARY</TE>
<TE>   With the departure of Kris Richard and Chris Cash to the NFL and
the season-ending foot injury suffered by senior Kevin Arbet, the
Trojans could be vulnerable at cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Darrell Rideaux will start on the right side and junior
college transfer Ronald Nunn will start on the left. Freshman Justin
Wyatt could get significant playing time.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Marcell Allmond, making the transition from receiver, also
will play.</TE>
<TE>   All-American Troy Polamalu and senior DeShaun Hill provide
experience and leadership as safeties.</TE>
<TE>   SPECIAL TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   Senior David Davis made 15 of 18 field-goal attempts last season.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen, a transfer from Mount San Antonio College, was
recruited specifically to kick the ball into the end zone on
kickoffs. He might also be used on long-range field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Tom Malone is the punter</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Kelly will handle punt returns in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who is also the defensive coordinator, shuffled his staff
a bit before his second season, hiring Tim Davis from Wisconsin to
handle guards and centers on the offensive line, and Greg Burns from
Louisville to coach the secondary.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sarkisian, a former player for offensive coordinator Norm
Chow at Brigham Young, is coaching the quarterbacks. He served as an
offensive graduate assistant last year. Kennedy Pola will again
handle special teams and will also coach running backs.</TE>
<TE>   Lane Kiffin switched from coaching tight ends to wide receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Uperesa, offensive line coach last season, is responsible
for tackles and tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan Carroll, Pete's son, is a graduate assistant working with
the offense and special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Holt is in his second season coaching linebackers, Ed Orgeron
begins his fifth season coaching the defensive line, and Rocky Seto
is a defensive assistant handling safeties.</TE>

<LD>Two members of the Sparks are on the short list of the most memorable
shots in WNBA history:</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 4, 1999: Da Bomb</LD>
<LD>   With the New York Liberty down by two and on the verge of
elimination in the 1999 Finals, Teresa Weatherspoon heaved a 50-foot
shot that banked in and gave the Liberty a 68-67 victory over
Houston.</LD>
<TE>   July 30, 2002: Above the Rim</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the time was right and everything fell into place: Midway
through the first half of a game against Miami, the Sparks' Lisa
Leslie was alone in transition, drove to the basket and became the
first player to dunk in a WNBA game.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 31, 2002: Threesley</TE>
<TE>   It must be something about players from North Carolina. Michael
Jordan (1982) and Charlotte Smith (1994) won NCAA titles with
last-minute shots for the Tar Heels. Rookie Nikki Teasley didn't
perform the deed until she reached the pros, her three-pointer with
2.4 seconds to play giving the Sparks a 69-66 victory over New York
and their second straight title.</TE>
