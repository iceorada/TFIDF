<HD>Ambrose's 'Custer' Comes Under Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Just days after admitting his latest bestseller includes passages
copied from another historian's work, author Stephen Ambrose is being
cited again for a similar trespass in an earlier work. Forbes .com is
reporting that Ambrose's "Crazy Horse and Custer" contains sections
similar to Jay Monaghan's "Custer."</LD>
<LD>   A spokesperson for Ambrose on Tuesday  declined to comment. Anchor
Books, which publishes the paperback edition of "Crazy Horse and
Custer," also had no comment.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Ambrose acknowledged that his current bestseller, "The
Wild Blue," included passages taken from Thomas Childers' "Wings of
Morning."</LD>
<TE>   "I failed to put some words and sentences of Dr. Childers' into
quotation marks. I am sorry for this omission and apologize to him,"
Ambrose said in a prepared statement. "I will make that change,
putting his words into quotation marks, in all future editions of my
book."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose footnoted Childers in the sections in question but did not
acknowledge quoting directly from the book. Both books are about
World War II bomber pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy Horse and Custer" apparently follows a similar pattern.
Ambrose credits "Custer" as a source, but fails to use quotation
marks for passages close to the original. Ambrose's book came out in
1975, Monaghan's in 1955. Monaghan died in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Here is Monaghan's description of Gen. Custer's return to the U.S.
Military Academy after a furlough:</TE>
<TE>   "On August 28, 1859, Custer returned to West Point. Cadet James
Barroll Washington, a great-great-grandnephew of George Washington,
entered that year. He remembered hearing the crowd shout, 'Here comes
Custer!' The name meant nothing to him, but he turned, and saw a
slim, immature lad with unmilitary figure, slightly rounded
shoulders, and gangling walk."</TE>
<TE>   Here is Ambrose's version:</TE>
<TE>   "When he returned to West Point, Cadet James B. Washington, a
relative of George Washington, remembered hearing the crowd shout,
'Here comes Custer!' The name meant nothing to Washington, who was
just entering the Academy, but he turned and saw a slim, immature lad
with unmilitary figure, slightly rounded shoulders, and gangling
walk, surrounded by back-slapping, laughing friends."</TE>
<TE>   Many fellow historians believe Ambrose might have so internalized
Monaghan's text he unconsciously replicated it, or that the problem
originates with his team of research assistants. Ambrose is also
highly prolific, increasing the chance of error. He is the author of
more than 20 books, including such bestsellers as "Undaunted Courage"
and "Nothing Like It in the World."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Ellis, a historian suspended by Mount Holyoke College in
South Hadley, Mass., for lying to his students about being a Vietnam
combat veteran, said mistakes  are inevitable over a long career.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose has been criticized for factual errors. Last year, he came
out with a young-adult title called "The Good Fight: How World War II
Was Won." It included a map of Pearl Harbor showing that the Japanese
invasion occurred on Dec. 7, 1943, two years after the actual date.</TE>

<LD>"Hey, baby, it's your long lost-lover calling." Yeah, if only.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Tyler was quite excited when he called the other day, but
then the rock star had good reason. Aerosmith just got four Grammy
nominations (including best rock song, best rock album, best duo or
group rock performance) for its album "Just Push Play" as well as one
music video nomination. The band is finishing a successful tour--they
play at the Forum Sunday--and his daughter, Liv Tyler, stars in the
hit "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring."</LD>
<LD>   "Am I surprised that things turned out like this? I have to pinch
myself every day," said Tyler. "Life is really beautiful." (Well, it
certainly beats the time he spent in jail as a teenager, sitting next
to a toothless guy named Zeek.)</LD>
<TE>   Another reason for Tyler's high spirits: Aerosmith had total
control over an album's production for the first time in its
three-decade history. "We've always wanted to see if it was true that
we were hard to work with," he said. But things went without a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like going to Disney World for vacation, and then, after
10 years of doing that, going to Maui," said Tyler. "I'm never going
to have it any other way. Those days are gone." He said by producing
its own album, the band was "defending our precious little souls."</TE>
<TE>   Tyler also keeps a journal which he plans to turn into a book.
Some people in the music industry should be afraid. Very afraid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell the truth," Tyler warned. Among other things,
"I'm going to name the people who passed on Alanis Morissette."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the music business. His predictions for the Grammys?</TE>
<TE>   "Where is the talent? Alicia Keys--bingo! It's about
authenticity." And in the category of best rock album. "It's going to
be a hard one. I think ... [drumroll] ... Linkin Park."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Aerosmith doesn't win, Tyler is still grateful. He got the
life he dreamed of as a teenager. "I told my dad, 'When I grow up I
want to be a [rock star],' and he said, 'I don't think you can do
both.'"</TE>
<TE>   Smart guy.</TE>
<TE>   Teen Antics</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County," the new comedy by director Jake Kasdan and writer
Mike White (alums of the TV show "Freaks and Geeks"), premiered at
Paramount Studios in Hollywood on Monday night. The film tracks the
antics of high school senior Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) and his
older brother (Jack Black) during the 24 hours they have to land
Shaun a spot at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   It was a low-key affair. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson didn't show,
apparently to avoid overshadowing the film's star, son Colin. Sissy
Spacek followed her daughter, another of the film's co-stars,
Schuyler Fisk, down the red carpet, but Spacek stood outside the
velvet rope to give her daughter the limelight. Even Black seemed to
lack his usual ferocity. He admitted fretting over the red carpet
routine during his limo ride. "It's a little stressful--the red
carpet," he told us.</TE>
<TE>   Black, as the burned-out older brother, said he recalled
characters from his early life in Hermosa Beach when "I was
surrounded by stoners."</TE>
<TE>   But Black said he was careful not to repeat Sean Penn's famous
performance of marijuana-obsessed Spicoli in "Fast Times at Ridgemont
High." "If I ever caught myself in a 'Spicoli moment,' I would stop
and try to draw from fresh material," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Hanks said Black tested his ability to keep a straight face
during their scenes together. "It's the hardest thing I've ever
done," Hanks told us. To avoid laughing, Hanks pinched the inside of
his leg and bit the insides of his mouth until the makeup folks had
to be called.</TE>
<TE>   Bountiful Baskets</TE>
<TE>   While gift-giving season has passed for most of us, for those who
inhabit the world of awards shows, it's still in full swing.</TE>
<TE>   Presenters and performers at tonight's American Music Awards will
get elaborate baskets of goodies valued at $5,000. A palm-size
digital camcorder, light-up ice cubes, an electric scooter, a two-way
pager and a custom-made hat by Madonna's favorite hat designer Nick
Smith are included in every basket.</TE>
<TE>   But some celebrities got a few extras. Cher's basket features a
certificate for a custom-made bikini. Britney Spears gets a pack of
Starbucks goodies. Jennifer Love Hewitt gets her favorite bath salts.
Ludacris, Redman and Nelly were given custom-made jewelry. The
members of Sugar Ray got leather jackets and a stay in the
$2,500-per-night Elvis Suite at the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando, Fla.</TE>

<LD>And so we pack Christmas away for another year, the eggnog glasses,
the angel ornaments and a couple of the kids. Jeez, after two weeks
of vacation, don't your kids drive you nuts sometimes? For a moment,
we consider stuffing them away with the nutcrackers and the Christmas
tree skirt.</LD>
<LD>   "Somebody grab that angel," my wife says, and I don't know whether
she's talking about the one on the mantel or the mouthy kid with the
grape juice on her sweatshirt.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, Dad, grab that angel," says the little girl.</LD>
<TE>   Christmas. It's time for you to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't we, like, just leave some of the decorations up?" the boy
says before belching, then sneezing, then smiling, the entire range
of adolescent emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Dad," says the little girl. "For once, just leave the
Christmas stuff out."</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of families, we're suffering from post-traumatic
Christmas syndrome. We don't want Christmas to end. We don't want to
return to work or school. With post-traumatic Christmas syndrome,
denial is common. The overwhelming urge: to do nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, this one can go out," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Him?" I ask, pointing to the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "No, the box," she says.</TE>
<TE>   So I carry another box to the basement, thinking as always, that
every house should be required to have a Christmas closet, a very
large, very deep cabinet just off the living room where you could
conveniently stash the decorations till next November. Or August. Or
whenever it is we begin Christmas anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's two more," my wife says when I get back.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot to think about as we de-decorate the house. About
what a great holiday season we had, everyone safe and healthy. Mostly
sane.</TE>
<TE>   The older daughter is still home from college, where she is
majoring in sarcasm and minoring in sleep. Fortunately, they have an
excellent program in sarcasm at the school she attends. In one
semester, she has made great strides--though she also possesses a
family gift for the flip remark, one of the better Irish traits.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you could get a sarcasm scholarship," I tell her during one
family dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad," she says, "that would be my dream."</TE>
<TE>   This gift of sarcasm will serve my lovely daughter well in life,
as long as she doesn't allow the sarcasm to deteriorate into
cynicism, which is unattractive and self-poisoning. But so far,
sarcasm is serving her well.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice sweater, Dad," she says as I carry another box out of the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Or is that a girdle?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   I'm wearing my new Christmas sweater, which fits me like a condom,
tight everywhere--in the shoulders and the waist.</TE>
<TE>   I can barely move my arms, so tight is this sweater. To scratch my
nose, I need to rub it against a tree.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of sweater Richard Dawson wore on "Hogan's Heroes,"
ribbed and dark and with a severe military look. I lift each
Christmas box with the goal of not passing out.</TE>
<TE>   "You look sharp," the little girl says as I flail about in my wool
body cast, trying to take down some lights.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas is slowly going away, and it's a terrific time to look
ahead to other celebrations. Mardi Gras is nearly upon us. Pitchers
and catchers report to camp in just under four weeks. Right after
that, the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The auto show is on this week, and there's that deep quilt of snow
beckoning in the Sierra. I haven't even mentioned the NFL playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, there is also work to be done and resolutions to be kept.
Mine? To eliminate those pesky little stickers from fruit. It's an
ambitious goal. It may take more than a year. Maybe a lifetime. I
grow more devoted every time I accidentally swallow one with my
apple.</TE>
<TE>   After that, there is even more to do. At work, my buddy Irv tells
me about a new place in Porterville to buy steak. According to Irv,
he's found a ranch that feeds the cattle a mixture of molasses and
Cheerios.</TE>
<TE>   "The meat marinates from within," he says with a gleam in his eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Molasses?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Yep," says Irv. "And after every meal, the cattle get a nice
massage."</TE>
<TE>   It's a beautiful concept, one that gives me hope for the food
sciences in general, and optimism about man's ability to triumph over
the ordinary. If you can marinate a cow from the inside, those pesky
little fruit stickers ought to be a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, you have to buy the entire cow," Irv says, and all
I can do is picture us returning from Porterville with a live cow
tied to the bumper of Irv's SUV, me holding a feed bag of molasses
and Cheerios.</TE>
<TE>   "Slower!" I'll yell to Irv. "She's trying to eat!"</TE>
<TE>   So amid the challenges of 2002, there may be great adventures as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "Rhonda called," my wife says as we wrap together one of the last
Christmas boxes. "She wants me to play bunco this week."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Green called," the boy says. "He wants us to go to the auto
show.</TE>
<TE>   Already, what a year it's been. Can you believe it's almost 2003?</TE>

<DH>Are seat belts really a good idea on school buses?  Think
of what kids are like on them.  Now think what they could do with a
seat belt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MCNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The school bus is an icon with a personality conflict. From the
outside, it is a symbol of all that is good and wholesome about
America; its instantly recognizable yellow is warm and soothing, its
rounded contours seem safe and maternal, perfectly shaped for bearing
our children from their nutritious breakfasts to their motivated
teachers and home again.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, it's a whole other story. Oh, the elementary school buses
are OK, but anything after that is "Lord of the Flies" meets "Cool
Hand Luke." Inside, that icon of safety is an endless, multi-fronted
battle for power fought by an ever-shifting alliance of warriors who
can make a deadly weapon out of a bobby pin, whose political and
social machinations make the Medicis look kindly, the War of the
Roses simplistic.</LD>
<LD>   And now it's just gotten a whole lot worse. Because, as of Jan. 1,
all new school buses bought or leased by the state of California are
required to have combination seat and lap belts.</LD>
<TE>   I want everyone who ever rode a school bus to close their eyes for
a minute. Imagine the ride home from school every day, the salty,
grassy funk of 60-odd kids squashed against one another, three to a
seat; the shouted insults and double-dares; the thud of a lunch box
hitting a window in a game of keep-away; the sudden metallic snap of
someone's binder being undone, its contents hurled to the floor; the
constant undertone of argument and discontent as kids are shoved and
pinched and punched very hard in the arm, the occasional burst of
tears.</TE>
<TE>   Now add a whole new element: For every child, a sturdy strap with
a nice heavy chunk of metal on the end. Imagine the
possibilities--the smaller kid strapped into a corner, the web of
belts strung across the aisle, the choking sounds, the taunting of
the heavier kids who have a hard enough time fitting into the seats
at all, the gum and other objects jammed into the mouths of the
clasps, the attempts at martial arts competitions. And above it all
the lament of the poor driver as he or she tries to get every kid to
buckle up.</TE>
<TE>   A bus driver I know simply shook her head as New Year's Day
loomed. Impossible to enforce, she said, just another thing for the
already-beleaguered drivers to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   And apparently unnecessary. The bill, which was pushed through in
1997 by Assemblyman Martin Gallegos (D-Baldwin Park), was in direct
contradiction with a study done by the National Transportation Safety
Board that found that bus seats were too flat and slippery for the
belts to be effective. Another study by the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration will be completed early this
year; when asked, spokesman Tim Hurd pointed out that school bus
passenger fatalities and injuries are extremely rare. Nationwide
there are fewer than 10 deaths each year, and many of these,
including the two children who were killed in Los Angeles in 1995 by
a malfunctioning garbage truck, would not have been prevented by
safety belts.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for those who would be belted, the chance of actually
riding a new school bus in the next year or so is pretty slim.
Transportation is on the low end of the budget priority, according to
a representative of the Los Angeles Unified School District, so the
number of buses purchased or newly leased is likely to be very small.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, traditional anarchy reigns. It really only takes a few
kids to turn a bus bad. Close your eyes again and I bet you can see
the ones who led the charge on your bus, the kid who smoked in the
back, who snapped every bra strap in sight, the one who threw your
lunch out the window. Compared with what kids face now, these images
are probably quite tame. But wouldn't it have been nice if there had
been just enough belts to strap the troublemakers down?</TE>

<HD>Contrary to the Maxim, Flattery Can Indeed Get You
Somewhere</HD>

<LD>Take away the lack of utensils, the homicidal mania and the
occasional Cheech and Chong-ish repartee--"I saw in a dream [man], we
were playing a soccer game against the Americans [man]. And when our
team showed up on the field, they were all [like] pilots [man]"--and
the guys gathered around Osama bin Laden at his videotaped luncheon a
few weeks back sounded and acted very much like a bunch of VPs
sucking up to the CEO.</LD>
<LD>   But then why should the key to getting a key to the executive
washroom be any different in terrorist organizations?</LD>
<LD>   The simple truth is that the planting of a big wet one on the
boss' backside is so universal that it actually might be in our
genes.</LD>
<TE>   In his book "You're Too Kind: A Brief History of Flattery," Time
magazine columnist Richard Stengel maintains that flattery is
biological. He notes that among animal groups, bowing and scraping--a
form of flattery--in the presence of the dominant male is linked to
survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Flattery is a very small subset of what evolutionary biologists
call reciprocal altruism," Stengel says. "The purpose of that was to
help the species survive. So maybe in some small way it has an
evolutionary purpose."</TE>
<TE>   While flattery always has been around, Stengel says its nature
changed during the Renaissance, when people began thinking of
themselves as unique individuals. Before this period, flattery was
less personal. You praised the king, not the person who held the
throne. When this changed, flattery became not only an accepted means
of social mobility but an effective one as well.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   Because contrary to the maxim, flattery can get you everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "People are susceptible to flattery because it's telling them
something they want to hear," Stengel says. "Mark Twain once said,
'Everybody likes a compliment.' And almost everybody does, probably
because it gives us all a tiny hit of serotonin and makes us a little
bit happier."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the greater your self-esteem, the more susceptible
you are to flattery. This is because people who think highly of
themselves tend to view flattery not so much as outright fawning but
as perceptive observation.</TE>
<TE>   Stengel includes himself in this group. "I still get fooled all
the time," he says, "even when people are teasing me about it. That's
the extraordinary thing about flattery; even if you know it's
flattery, you're still flattered."</TE>
<TE>   So is there anyone with whom flattery will get you nowhere?</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to what one might think, the person who is immune would
be someone who has such low self-esteem that he or she would find
anything complimentary to be a lie," Stengel says.</TE>
<TE>   Stengel draws a distinction between flattery and praise, with the
difference being sincerity. He notes that in the proper
context--school, for example--praise can be an important teaching
tool. But can't flattery also be of benefit?</TE>
<TE>   While railing against "grade-inflation flattery," the
over-adulation of movie stars and professional celebrities, Stengel
says in some circumstances, flattery can serve a purpose. He points
to what he calls little-white-lie flattery: telling the bride she is
beautiful or a hospitalized friend that he looks good.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Stengel is a proponent of flattery.</TE>
<TE>   "The world would be a drabber, less interesting place without
flattery," he says. "It's like chicken soup: It doesn't hurt, and it
may even help. Plus, we'd have so much less to laugh about."</TE>
<TE>   But what about the workplace butter-uppers, the shameless toadies
who would require emergency rhinoplasty if the boss stopped short?
Don't they keep more competent, deserving souls from climbing the
corporate ladder?</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, not always. Stengel says studies of ingratiation
show flattery increases liking but not perceptions of competence. So
if you are superior, it usually won't make a difference. But if the
competence of two individuals is equal, the flatterer will get the
nod.</TE>
<TE>   So the bottom line is a little puckering up won't hurt. But then a
reader as intelligent and perceptive as you already knew that.</TE>

<LD>Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
English and Spanish presentations. Today he talks to Riley about
riding in a booster seat.</LD>
<LD>   Riley had a very unhappy look on her face. She was looking at her
booster seat when her friend, Otto the Auto, drove up to talk.</LD>
<LD>   "Why the long face, Riley?" Otto asked.</LD>
<TE>   "My mom says that I have to ride in the booster seat, even though
I am 5 years old," Riley said. "I see other kids riding in the
regular seats. It's not fair that I should have to ride in a booster
seat, like a little kid."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I see," Otto said. "You know, Riley, your mom really must
love you a lot because she knows that a booster seat is the safest
way for you to ride. Not only does your seat belt fit correctly when
you're in your booster, but you get to see out the window much
better. Besides, boosters are for big kids."</TE>
<TE>   "But my big sister doesn't ride in one."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Otto answered. "Your sister is almost 12 years old. But for
kids your size, and any child up to 6 years of age or 60 pounds, the
law says you must use a booster seat or child safety seat to ride in
a car. Your mom not only wants to keep you safe, she's obeying the
law."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I never thought of that," Riley said with a smile. "You know,
I was just thinking. When I'm in my booster, I sit taller than my
sister."</TE>
<TE>   "That's enough to make anyone smile," Otto laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit
Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and teacher

<HD>The Night the Lights Went Out in Griffith Park</HD>
<DH>With the Observatory closing down for renovation, Laserium
shines its last beam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK EHRMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ahideous backup of cars jamming the road to Griffith Park usually
signifies a sold-out show at the Greek Theatre, but on this
particular Saturday night, the draw is higher up the hill. It's the
final performance of Laserium, the music-accompanied laser light show
phenomenon that began here at the Observatory 28 years ago. And while
the astronomy-teaching function of this grand 1935 structure is
scheduled to return in 2005 after a multimillion-dollar renovation,
Laserium will not. Not everybody, it seems, will be lucky enough to
get in this night, and, since the rangers lock the gate to the park
to halt the automotive influx, fewer still find a parking space.</LD>
<LD>   After hiking up, those who score tickets, as well 100 or so VIP
guests, have the honor of being the last group whose crania are
cradled in the planetarium's 600 worn wooden headrests, as they
comfortably (uh, sort of) gaze up at the ceiling and listen, for the
final time, as the Observatory guide welcomes everyone and warns them
that there is to be "no smoking of anything during the performance."</LD>
<TE>   Before the lights go down, the creator of Laserium, Ivan Dryer, is
introduced and receives a lengthy standing ovation. The 62-year-old
filmmaker with an astronomy and engineering background saw his first
"laser light show" in November 1970, when he was invited to film a
demonstration by a Caltech scientist who'd been using a laser in her
off hours to create artwork. A month later, he approached officials
at the Griffith Park Observatory, where he'd once worked as a guide,
with the idea of putting on a show there. For three years, the answer
was no, but a new administration warmed to the idea, and Laserium was
born.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first started, there were a whole lot of mistakes to be
made," recalls Dryer, a tall, wizened, Ichabod Crane of a man. "We
found that if we made mistakes on cue, on the beat, that was OK with
the audience." There was "The John Effect"--if too many toilets were
flushed in the bathroom, the water pressure in the water-cooled ion
gas laser (which reaches a core temperature of 5,000 degrees) would
fail. Dryer also recounts the time his then-partner accidentally
touched a high-voltage wire and shocked himself during a show, the
audience believing the screaming was part of the entertainment.
Similarly, when a fly landed on the lumia lens and began crawling
around it, casting a giant sci-fi insect form on the ceiling, the
crowd cheered wildly at the clever effect. Rather than swat it away,
Dryer says, "we wished we could train it and hire it for future
shows."</TE>
<TE>   In the intervening 28 years, laser technology and techniques
improved, glitches were removed and new versions came along--Laser
Rock, Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," Led Zeppelin,
Lollapalaser and the final incarnation, Laser Visions, which features
ambient/ techno/electronica a la Orb, Enya and Vangelis.</TE>
<TE>   "You signed on for Laser Visions tonight, but first we wanted to
bring you back to 1973 to what was the most popular selection from
the first Laserium show, the 'Blue Danube,'" says Dryer. With that,
the room darkens and what now appear to be simple (but back in the
day, radical and dazzling) red, blue, violet and green ellipses twirl
on the ceiling, expanding and contracting to the rhythms of the
Strauss waltz.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, Dryer will open the Laserium Cyberdome at an
as-yet-undisclosed location in Hollywood, which will feature live
music, lasers and other interactive 21st century gizmos. But when the
final strains of Robert Miles' "Children" fade out and the house
lights come back up, the entertainment franchise that spanned 45
cities and delighted more than 20 million people comes to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The VIP guests make their way over to the Tam O'Shanter Inn--a
rambling faux Scottish hunting lodge in nearby Atwater--for the
"wake," where a cold cuts and potato salad buffet awaits.</TE>
<TE>   "It was after seeing Laserium here in 1974 that I got inspired to
take this course in my life, so it's a nice kind of circle closing
itself to come here," says R. Merlin, a Jerry Garcia-ish figure from
West Los Angeles dressed in tie-dyed shirt and silver sneakers, with
a gray beard and ponytail. Nowadays, the 53-year-old Merlin performs
light shows for rock videos, including Michael Jackson's "Rock With
Me," as well as for the Academy Awards and other events.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the guests here seem like one large brotherhood of the
laser. "It's like a high school reunion. I'm seeing people I haven't
seen in years," says Ron Hipschman, part of a large Bay Area
contingent who worked the Laserium show during its run at San
Francisco's Morrison Planetarium. Other groups have come from as far
away as Florida. "Laserium is kind of a rallying point," says Craig
Spredemen, a former Laserium laser operator who now works as a
software engineer in West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Since there is no place to receive formal training in the laser
arts, the only way to learn is by becoming an apprentice, and thus,
Spredemen explains, "a lot of the people have had contact in one form
or another with Laserium at some time in their history."</TE>
<TE>   Invariably, that means working under Dryer, who appears to be
universally regarded with awe and respect. "There are all kinds of
horror stories that people tell about light show guys, especially
from the '70s," says one longtime member of the brotherhood. "But in
a field full of rapscallions, no one's ever said an ill word against
Ivan."</TE>

<HD>A Pre-Victorian Piano Strikes a Historical Chord</HD>
<DH>The discovery of the instrument in a dead man's basement
leads a researcher on an enlightening journey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL SCHOETTLER</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>WALDORF, Md.</DL>
<LD>The lovely old piano sounds as frail and plaintive and haunting as an
aging diva when Frank Owens taps out a scale on the yellowed ivory
keys.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, it sounds like it's coming to life," he says, "almost like
it's taking its first breath."</LD>
<LD>   Owens has what amounts to a private museum in his home near
Waldorf, southeast of Washington, D.C. He's amassed an extraordinary
collection of Civil War memorabilia and Native American artifacts.
But he'd never collected a pre-Victorian musical instrument until a
friend called about this old, square piano in the basement of a dead
man's estate.</LD>
<TE>   What he found half-buried in a pile of junk was a piano made
nearly two centuries ago by an American named Alpheus Babcock, one of
the great innovators in the history of the piano. In 1825, Babcock
invented the cast-iron frame that is used in every modern piano.</TE>
<TE>   "I bent over and looked at the front, and I saw it had keys. It
sparked something in me. I said, that's what I want," says Owens, 52.</TE>
<TE>   A private investigator and archeologist, he is a diligent and
tenacious researcher who has thoroughly explored and mapped the
escape route of John Wilkes Booth through Maryland's Zekiah Swamp
after the Lincoln assassination.</TE>
<TE>   He's traced the extraordinary odyssey of his piano from
Philadelphia into the Gulf of Mexico to New Orleans, up the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers by steamboat and then an additional 200
miles on a flatboat up the Wabash to Lafayette, Ind., and overland to
Logansport, Ind.--and then back east again, perhaps 150 years later.</TE>
<TE>   The piano evokes a kind of romantic lyricism in him.</TE>
<TE>   "I can imagine all the family on a summer night, or a winter
night, and all they would hear is echoes from this piano, and the
family would be gathered around, and all I could envision was these
people from that period just listening, all by the glow of
candlelight," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "And off in the distance, if you were to approach this beautiful
home, all you would see is the glow of the candlelight flickering,
and you'd hear this wonderful music and laughter coming from inside
this house."</TE>
<TE>   The piano stands among the cases and cabinets that contain the
Civil War relics, fossils and Native American arrowheads and axes
that Owens and his assistant, George Vougioukles, have unearthed
locally. Next to the piano is a mummy and a papier-mache case Owens
made for a United Way campaign. He's also a sculptor who worked with
Frederick Hart on sculptures that adorn the National Cathedral in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   He uncovered the piano about a year ago when his curiosity took
him to the home of the recently deceased William Louis Cornwell,
whose estate was being sold. Nobody wanted the three pianos that
remained in the Cornwell house. Owens wasn't interested in two of
them. But in a corner of the dark, musty basement he found the third
covered with a tarp and debris.</TE>
<TE>   "Wood scraps and years of dust were piled on top of what looked
like a long box," he says. "Inside it looked as though several
generations of mice had called the inner chamber home. Nuts and
nesting material were packed inside."</TE>
<TE>   He took it home and started cleaning. With a surgical probe he
pulled stuff out through an opening in the soundboard--lots of
peanuts, and a small pair of spectacles, a Continental Army button
and a heart-shaped locket snapped in two.</TE>
<TE>   Owens polished it with linseed oil and elbow grease, and the
mahogany piano now glows with a dark, rich sheen.</TE>
<TE>   "When I opened it, I could tell I was the first one in years to
touch it," he says. "It thrills me to touch something untouched."</TE>
<TE>   When he first lifted the top of the piano, he found inside brown
and brittle fragments of a clipping from a newspaper called the
Logansport Pharos for Tuesday, May 3, 1904. The research into the
piano's past began there.</TE>
<TE>   The headline on the newspaper scraps says: "Piano With History ...
Old Instrument Brought Here in Pioneer Days Is Unearthed ... Sent
From New Orleans by Boat."</TE>
<TE>   But about one-third of the story was missing. Owens located files
of the Pharos in the Logansport library in Indiana and was sent the
rest of the story.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the article," Owens says, "in 1904 the piano was
discovered in a basement. Ninety-seven years later, I discovered the
piano in a basement."</TE>
<TE>   Engraved on a brass plate just above the keyboard is the
inscription "Made by A. Babcock for John G. Klemm." Klemm was a
Philadelphia music publisher who seems also to have sold instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock patented the first one-piece iron piano frame in 1825.
Babcock's harp-shaped iron frame allowed for greater string tension,
which produces the bigger, louder, more stable tone of the modern
piano. Earlier wooden frames warped under string tension and went out
of tune easily. Before Babcock's invention, pianos were sometimes
tuned in mid-concert.</TE>
<TE>   Only two Babcock pianos with iron frames are known to have
survived. One was featured in the Smithsonian's Piano 300 exhibit in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Owens' rediscovered piano has a wooden frame, which makes him
think it was made before 1825. "This harp here is all hand-hewn and
carved," he says, stroking the wood under the frame. "There's so much
charm in that. I just love that. I just come down and smell it and
touch it."</TE>

<HD>The Inside Scoop From Outsiders</HD>
<DH>Sure, they might have a formula for success, but Santa
Monica isn't the easiest place to launch a daily newspaper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The corpses of dead dailies litter this country like the battlefield
at Antietam, but in cafes, sidewalks and, yes, the cyberspace ether
swirling above Santa Monica, it looks like a newfangled newspaper war
could be brewing.</LD>
<LD>   Run by a trio of Colorado carpetbaggers, the freebie Santa Monica
Daily Press sneaked into town in mid-November like a guerrilla,
materializing out of the newsprint jungle.</LD>
<LD>   In a politically progressive town whose residents are starved for
news about themselves, the flimsy tabloid--a compendium of wire
stories, a few locally generated pieces and advertising--has a
certain appeal. And a goofy charm.</LD>
<TE>   The brains behind the operation, a Boston-born Aspen man named
Dave Danforth, lists himself cryptically as "Test Subject" on the
masthead. The paper's interim motto: Serving Santa Monica for the
past (today's count: 58) days.</TE>
<TE>   Danforth's partners are publisher Ross Furukawa, a 31-year-old San
Diego software entrepreneur, and editor Carolyn Sackariason, a
33-year-old native of Minneapolis, who writes most of the paper's
local stories. They met at the Aspen Daily News, a paper co-founded
by Danforth in 1978, and the progenitor of a string of similar
dailies.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica, an affluent, educated city of 84,000, has not had a
daily newspaper to call its own since the 123-year-old Outlook was
shuttered by its owner in March 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of a daily paper in Santa Monica is notable, given
that the famously rent-controlled coastal city makes national news,
routinely passing some of the most progressive legislation in the
country--banning ATM fees, strictly regulating the environment,
trying to force businesses to pay resort employees a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our own police system, our own bus system, and we are a
very self-contained community," says Kevin McKeown, Santa Monica's
Mayor pro tem. "But in terms of the Los Angeles Times and other major
media outlets, Santa Monica is seen as just another suburban area.
People forget there is a community in which they can play a part."</TE>
<TE>   Since the demise of the Outlook, a glut of publications has rushed
to fill the vacuum. But success in Santa Monica has proved elusive,
even for large papers. Within the last two years, as part of a shift
in the paper's business and journalistic strategy, the Los Angeles
Times closed both of its neighborhood supplements that focused on
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The city is now served by three weeklies--the Santa Monica Mirror,
Santa Monica Bay Week and the Santa Monica Observer. The Marina del
Rey-based weekly, the Argonaut, also covers Santa Monica. The Santa
Monica Sun, a monthly, focuses on entertainment. Until the debut of
the Daily Press, only two publications--both electronic
(www.surfsantamonica.com and www.oceanparkgazette.org)--offered a
daily news report.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica Daily Press, which does not publish on Sunday ,
is printed in Gardena, has a press run of 4,000 and six full-time
employees (only one of whom, Sackariason, is a full-time reporter).
As of Tuesday, the city has approved a total of 54 news boxes, which
are scattered throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hall, publisher of the Sun, once tried to get all the
publications to join forces, but, he says, the experience was "like
getting the Afghan tribal leaders together to create a country. Santa
Monica, he adds, "is a very tough environment for newspapers.
Everyone in the world wants to own a newspaper in Santa Monica. This
is like the Holy Grail."</TE>
<TE>   Going Against</TE>
<TE>   Conventional Wisdom</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the "father of the micro-daily" by the San Francisco
Chronicle, Danforth, 51, has helped launch seven free daily papers
since he co-founded the Aspen Daily News in 1978. He has managed to
make nearly all of them profitable by ignoring conventional newspaper
wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   That wisdom says newspapers have been a mature industry for more
than a century, and that the industry has been subject to
consolidation so massive that most American cities are now monopoly
markets for a single morning paper.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the development of other media such as radio, TV and
now practically hourly updates on the Internet, continues to erode
the security of even the most successful newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had known that you can't start a daily newspaper anymore we
wouldn't have done it," Danforth says. Like his businesses, Danforth
is lean, with a runner's body. He enjoys needling reporters from big
papers whom he regards as fat and complacent. He likes to make jokes
and talks about how much fun he's having with this whole micro-daily
venture, but it's clear he is dead serious.</TE>
<TE>   The way Danforth tells it, his first foray into the news business
happened by accident. The Aspen Daily News (Motto: "If you don't want
it printed, don't let it happen") debuted as a one-page wall poster,
stuck on bulletin boards around town. The paper began accepting ads
to cover its printing costs. Eventually the paper grew to 28 pages.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Danforth ventured into New Hampshire, where he launched
the Conway Daily Sun, followed three years later by the Berlin Daily
Sun. In 1992, Danforth, who attended Yale as an undergraduate,
enrolled in Stanford University's MBA program and distilled his
experience into a business plan which he and some classmates applied
when they launched the Palo Alto Daily News in 1995, the Berkeley
Daily Planet in 1999 and the San Mateo Daily Journal in 2000. He
claims all the papers, with the exception of the Daily Planet, turned
a profit after nine months to three years.</TE>
<TE>   While Danforth says the papers are not cookie-cutter, they all
share certain characteristics: They are free, and generate revenue
through ad sales. They all publish in the morning and contain hard
news, which Danforth defines as cops, courts, schools, business.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, all the papers all have significantly lower advertising
rates than their competitors. So far, Daily Press advertisers include
local restaurants and stores.</TE>
<TE>   Danforth tries to enter a new market without fanfare. That's
because after he announced the launch of his second newspaper, in
Conway, N.H., the local weekly with its own printing press instantly
went daily. "It took four years to get them out of the market," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   While the journalistic merits of Danforth's product can be
debated, there's no question a certain spirit is at work. When he
launches a new paper, says Danforth, he aims to win a community's
confidence with a select few hard-hitting stories. Each of his
papers, he says, has published a story that put it on the city's
radar. In Aspen, the paper focused on alleged favoritism within the
Police Department. In Palo Alto, the paper honed in on a
controversial downtown developer's project.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a story written by Danforth with the inflammatory
headline "SM City Hall: Savior or Slumlord?" addressed the city's
struggle over how to improve one of its last mobile home parks.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Moncrief, the city's housing and redevelopment manager, says
he thinks the piece was balanced and well researched. "It documented
all the issues rather than establishing any new kind of insight."</TE>
<TE>   The Big Papers</TE>
<TE>   Take on Local News</TE>
<TE>   Every community benefits from a local, daily paper, says Bryce
Nelson, a journalism professor at the USC Annenberg School for
Communication. But a city like Santa Monica is in a curious position.</TE>
<TE>   "The general problem is that for big metropolitan papers like the
Los Angeles Times, the [Chicago] Tribune, the [Washington] Post, is
how to provide enough local news to places like Santa Monica,
Pasadena, Burbank," says Nelson. "It's expensive, and that's why they
have backed away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have tried to make a go of it in Santa Monica say there
is simply not enough advertising in the city to cover the costs of a
daily. The city is increasingly dominated by chains that do not
advertise much in local papers. Grocery stores, once the financial
lifeblood of newspapers, such as the Outlook, no longer provide the
kind of revenue they once did.</TE>
<TE>   McKeown, the Santa Monica politician, laments the dearth of debate
on political issues, which he attributes to the lack of a
well-produced daily paper in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "An informed electorate is one of the real pieces of democracy,"
he says. "We are at a disadvantage if we don't have daily news.
Someone with deep pockets can afford to put misinformation in your
mailbox every day. Free information negates a lot of the evil of
campaign money."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica resident Peter Coopersmith gets his local news from
friends, fliers and word on the street, an anachronism in a wealthy
21st century city. "There are no sources for local details about what
is going on," he says. "There is no real investigation of anything.
It's a real shame."</TE>
<TE>   While the appetite for better coverage is strong, the bigger
question remains: Can the Daily Press deliver the in-depth stories
Santa Monicans crave and can it spark the higher quality news often
generated by a newspaper war?</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you can produce something of some quality," says Nelson,
"it is going to be a tough sell."</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Casuso, a former Outlook reporter who is editor and founder
of surfsantamonica.com, misses the keen sense of competition. "I find
that I look at the other papers, when I can find them," says Casuso.
"If we miss a story, I'll kick my desk or something, but there there
is not this kind of intense rivalry."</TE>
<TE>   Carolanne Sudderth, the founder and editor of the online Ocean
Park Gazette, which subsists on grants from businesses and
organizations such as Santa Monica College, says she feels rivalry
with her online competitor but reserves judgment about the Daily
Press. "It's another in a series of ... papers that are trying to
take the place of the Outlook but aren't willing to walk the walk,"
she says. "They don't go out and gather the news. Jorge and I are the
only reporters who go out there and attend the meetings, read the
environmental impact reports. The Mirror, the Observer and now the
Daily Press are basically wannabes."</TE>
<TE>   Skip Rimer, former executive editor of the now defunct Outlook,
likens the Daily Press to a hopelessly out-of-shape person working
out at a gym. "Some people would laugh," he says. "I say more power
to them, at least they are trying. But I personally wouldn't bet my
life savings on starting a paper in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Rimer, director of communications at the Milken Institute in Santa
Monica, says a lot of papers have tried to make a go of it since the
Outlook folded. "I would bet that none of them are making money hand
over fist because of the competition and because it is difficult to
survive as a small city newspaper today, especially when you are in
the Los Angeles Times' shadow." As for whether this mini-news war in
Santa Monica will ultimately benefit readers, Rimer is skeptical.
"This is not like the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News
battling it out for journalistic supremacy," he says. "They are all
just battling it out to make a buck."</TE>

<LD>When Ms. Carter told me I should do an interview with Callie, I was
excited! That's what real reporters do. They talk to the person and
get all the information, and then they write their stories. This is
great! I went home and made a list.</LD>
<LD>   * Call Callie.</LD>
<LD>   * Think of questions.</LD>
<TE>   * Interview Callie.</TE>
<TE>   * Write story.</TE>
<TE>   * Interview everybody else who is doing cool stuff. (Definition of
"cool"--things I don't do.)</TE>
<TE>   Callie was excited. She said she thought it was going to be fun
because she's never been interviewed before.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of the interview, I sharpened three pencils. I
got a big thick pad of paper. And I asked Callie lots of questions.</TE>
<TE>   How does it feel to play soccer?</TE>
<TE>   When you score a goal, is it exciting?</TE>
<TE>   Why do you like soccer?</TE>
<TE>   Do you want to be a professional soccer player when you grow up?</TE>
<TE>   I wrote down her every word.</TE>
<TE>   And then I wrote my story.</TE>
<TE>   If I do say so myself, it was pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   So I went to the newspaper office to talk to Ms. Carter about how
my next story could be about Linda, who plays tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Carter told me she really liked my story but that I might want
to interview a girl named Jenna.</TE>
<TE>   "Does she play sports and do exciting things?" I asked Ms. Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Carter smiled and told me it was a surprise, but this girl had
set a school record.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of school record?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Carter smiled and said that Jenna would come to her office
tomorrow and that I could find out all about her then.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: What school record did Jenna set?</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped says she started writing the very same way Emily

<HD>TV Starts Scripting Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Television* A CBS drama on the Pennsylvania plane crash is
in the works. It's among the first projects to tackle events related
to that day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first steps to dramatize the events of Sept. 11 as TV movies have
begun, with CBS planning a project that would document in real time
behind-the-scenes developments on the ground that paralleled the
flight of United Airlines Flight 93--the plane that crashed in rural
Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   The movie is being developed by author-filmmaker Lawrence
Schiller, who transformed his books "American Tragedy," about the
O.J. Simpson defense team; and "Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,"
exploring the JonBenet Ramsey case, into fact-based CBS miniseries
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Schiller, at work on a CBS production of the tale of confessed spy
Robert Hanssen, said he will base his account on "very, very
confidential sources that we were introduced to and got to know while
[developing] the Hanssen miniseries."</LD>
<TE>   Schiller stressed that his movie, tentatively titled "The Real
Story of Flight 93," would focus on "how America banded together, and
came together, to protect itself." It will be told from the
perspective of government agencies and personnel who were "drawn into
the event in split-second timing."</TE>
<TE>   Although a script has yet to be written, the project will follow a
90-minute timeline that Schiller is developing through independent
reporting and interviews with intelligence sources. He added that the
movie would not deal with events on the plane and risk "invading the
privacy" of those who died.</TE>
<TE>   At least two other TV movie projects based on the Sept. 11 attacks
are in development, including a production said to be under
discussion that would use the stories of those on Flight 93 as
material. In addition, Alliance Atlantis--the Canadian company
responsible for the hit CBS series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"
and last year's Judy Garland biography, "Life With Judy Garland: Me
and My Shadows"--is researching a movie on the Hamburg, Germany,
terrorist cell believed to have been involved in carrying out the
hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance Atlantis President Peter Sussman said that the company
has yet to take its project to a network, but that it would explore
the background of youths recruited into the cell, many of whom were
highly Westernized.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it as being incredibly relevant," Sussman said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond possible issues of taste and sensitivity, part of the
problem such ripped-from-the-headlines movies have faced in recent
years stems from the ability of prime-time newsmagazines to
thoroughly and compellingly document such material long before a
movie can be produced. "Dateline NBC," for example, devoted one show
entirely to the Flight 93 passengers. In addition, some dramatic
series--such as "NYPD Blue" and "Third Watch"--have incorporated
references to Sept. 11 into episodes.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the expectation is that the earliest Schiller's
project could air would be roughly a year from now. Moreover, TV
movies in general have been suffering in recent years, with the
networks cutting back on orders in part due to competition from
movies on HBO and other cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schiller maintains that by employing original journalism,
it's possible to bring fresh perspective and material to these TV
productions, and even "educate while entertaining."</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not educational, if we don't learn something by it, then
it has no purpose.... It would be exploitive," Schiller said.</TE>
<TE>   CBS confirmed the project but referred inquiries to the producers.
No formal cooperation from the White House or government is being
sought at this juncture, Schiller noted, saying that such
considerations may arise once production begins in terms of where
filming takes place. At press time, a White House spokeswoman had not
returned a call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Groove Armada Gets Back  in Touch With Its DJ Side</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While English electronic duo Groove Armada did release a mix CD
between its last two original releases, "Vertigo" and the recent
"Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub," few think of Tom Findlay and Andy
Cato as DJs. The pair has made its reputation instead with the
stylish grooves that have become the Groove Armada signature.</LD>
<LD>   But on Monday at the club 1650 (formerly Vynyl), Findlay and Cato
got to show a different side of Groove Armada as they put on their
dancing shoes during an extended DJ set.</LD>
<LD>   Their long hiatus from that role was apparent, as they were unable
to establish a flow for much of the set. While the song
selection--which included a number of diva-fronted disco/house tracks
mixed in with some rousing build-ups founded on Caribbean bongos and
bells--kept the crowd dancing, the two dominant sounds never
successfully merged. Much of the problem stemmed from the pair's
inability to follow on those builds. Several times, they had the
opportunity to take the room to the next level, but they pulled back
just enough to lose their momentum.</LD>
<TE>   In spite of those deficiencies, though, the set worked because it
accomplished its main purpose. Those who packed into 1650 not only
got to put faces to Groove Armada's detached cool, but they also got
to see the men responsible for the sound get down and dirty.</TE>

<HD>Clamor to Enter Moussaoui Trial</HD>
<DH>Television* If cameras are allowed in the courtroom, other
networks are expected to join Court TV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Court TV, which is leading a fight to televise the trial of an
alleged accomplice in the Sept. 11 attacks, will probably have
company if a judge allows cameras.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema plans a hearing today on Court
TV's request to set aside rules banning cameras in federal courtrooms
for the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   "We would give serious consideration to televising it," said
Dennis Murray, daytime executive producer at Fox News Channel. "Parts
of it will be riveting but, like any trial, it will have dull
moments."</LD>
<TE>   If the request is granted--which some television executives
consider a longshot--Court TV will probably offer its pictures to any
other network that wants to take part. C-SPAN has already expressed
interest.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the most high-profile television trial since O.J.
Simpson's murder case, and it rekindles the debate among lawyers and
prosecutors over what effect TV cameras have on a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui last week became an unexpected ally of TV networks when
he asked Brinkema to allow cameras to make sure the proceedings are
fair.</TE>
<TE>   He is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the hijackers
and others to commit the Sept. 11 attacks, and could be sentenced to
death if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   TV experts said a televised trial would most likely get extensive,
if not gavel-to-gavel, coverage on cable news networks CNN, Fox News
Channel and MSNBC. Broadcast networks were less sure, in part because
the trial would probably not take place until next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was breaking news of vital importance to the American
people, we would break into regular programming," said Jeff
Schneider, ABC News spokesman. "But at this point the plan is to see
how the trial develops and cover it like we would any other news
story."</TE>
<TE>   Court TV has the most to gain if the rules are waived to allow
cameras. The Simpson saga made the network and almost broke it, too.
At its peak in September 1995, Court TV was watched in an average of
422,000 households per day.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers disappeared when the trial was over; during some months,
Court TV was seen in an average of only 45,000 households.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't reached its Simpson peaks since then, but Court TV
Chairman Henry Schleiff has rebuilt the network into a modest success
story with a combination of court coverage, documentaries and reruns
of network legal dramas. The network has televised about 750 trials
since it began in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Schleiff predicted great interest in a Moussaoui trial. "Frankly,
it is the perfect precedent as to why we should be in federal
courts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks were a crime that affected almost everyone
in the United States, and everyone should have the opportunity to see
the trial of an alleged accomplice, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Schleiff was unwilling to predict whether public interest
would match that of the Simpson case. Some experts suggest the trial
would be more confusing and less compelling than that of the former
football star accused of killing his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be like the Iran-Contra hearings," Murray said. "You
really had to have been a buff to stay with it and follow all of the
intricacies."</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC Chief Executive Erik Sorenson also said he expects less
public interest than in the Simpson case, but the Moussaoui trial's
importance and the likely unprecedented nature of testimony would
draw viewers if cameras were allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "We always base our decisions on trial coverage on what else is
going on at the time," Sorenson said.</TE>

<HD>The Tortoise and Hare Story of CNN and Fox News</HD>
<DH>Television* Viewers tend to turn to CNN on big news days,
but Fox is building a loyal following.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>You've seen the pro basketball team with two players of starkly
different abilities.</LD>
<LD>   One possesses a world of talent but is enigmatic. He can erupt for
a 35-point game but just as easily have a bad night and miss almost
every shot he puts up. He's injury-prone too.</LD>
<LD>   The other player is steady but unspectacular. He'll never score 35
but can be depended on for 12 points or so every night. He's
predictable. And he plays hurt.</LD>
<TE>   In broad strokes, that's similar to the difference advertisers can
see between the fiercely competitive cable news networks CNN and Fox
News Channel. The differences in their audiences have come into
sharper focus since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   By the most common measurement, the two audiences are fairly close
in size. In November, for example, an average of 905,000 people were
watching CNN in any given minute, and 747,000 were watching Fox,
according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cumulative audience--the number of different people who
tuned in for at least 15 minutes at some point in November--measured
93.4 million for CNN and 58.5 million for Fox. (MSNBC remains a
distant third.)</TE>
<TE>   Translation: The Fox audience is smaller but more likely to tune
in regularly. CNN has a bigger pool of viewers, but if it's a slow
news day, they're more likely to check out a program elsewhere on the
dial.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're still benefiting from being a better-known brand
in terms of news," said Kevin Magee, vice president of programming
for Fox News Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "If you never ate soup and your doctor said to you, 'You have to
eat soup,' you'd probably go and buy Campbell's," he said. "You know
that brand, they've been around forever, you had it as a kid, it's
fine. But if you ate soup, you'd probably wonder if there are better
brands, or make your own. I think CNN benefits from being
Campbell's."</TE>
<TE>   During the week after the terrorist attacks, people hungry for
news were more likely to tune to CNN instead of Fox. CNN's average
audience ballooned to 3.3 million viewers. Fox's increase was
smaller, to 1.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox Chief Executive Roger Ailes told the New York Times that he
expected to pass CNN in revenue soon, leading Jamie Kellner, chairman
of CNN parent Turner Broadcasting, to say Ailes "probably also
believes he's better-looking than Tom Cruise."</TE>
<TE>   Kellner, in an interview, said advertisers respond to the wide
reach of CNN's audience.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a big tent, you're hitting a lot of people," he said.
"If you don't have as many viewers, it's like a pup tent."</TE>
<TE>   But CNN's emphasis on the cumulative viewing figures represents a
significant change in attitude. The mandate for former CNN leader
Rick Kaplan was to increase CNN's regular viewership so the network
could survive the down times. He never succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Fox beat CNN to it. The Fox mix of news and a
personality-driven prime-time lineup that mirrors conservative talk
radio is such a success that CNN made ham-handed attempts to imitate
it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that CNN discourages regular viewers--Paula Zahn's new
morning show is a strong step toward creating a new habit--but it
indicates that CNN's new leadership better accepts reality.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old saying: You sell what you've got in your truck,"
said Tom Wolzien, media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, CNN is a phenomenal brand and has excellent
recognition," Wolzien said. "It is the place where people go when
they need to know what's going on, and they had a reinforcement of
that after Sept. 11. Fox is really a different beast. It clearly has
a more loyal audience."</TE>
<TE>   Fox last week poached CNN personality Greta Van Susteren to host
an evening talk show, retaliation for CNN snapping up Fox's Zahn
months earlier. Fox also hired Geraldo Rivera (from CNBC) as a war
correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   Between Kellner, CNN chief Walter Isaacson and Ailes, the two
networks have the colorful, competitive leaders to ensure a hot news
war for years to come. In less than a year on the job, Kellner has
purged on-air talent, changed CNN's look and boosted the network's
self-promotion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably 60% of the way to where we're going," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pixar Can Boast Striking Effects on an Industry</HD>
<DH>Movies* The outfit has generated its own hit films and
techniques that have shaped others, earning a LACMA salute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While 2001 proved a landmark year for computer-animated
features--dominated, of course, by the blockbuster success of
DreamWorks' "Shrek" and Pixar's "Monsters, Inc."--it also marked the
15th anniversary of Pixar, the company that started it all when it
graduated from short-film obscurity to a commanding feature debut
with "Toy Story." With its wonderful blend of wit, sophistication,
sincerity and technical savvy, Pixar pioneered the computer-animated
feature and made it appealing to child and adult alike, reinventing
the Disney storytelling formula for a new generation.</LD>
<LD>   Pixar also paved the way for "Shrek," "Final Fantasy: The Spirits
Within," "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" and this year's "Ice Age." And
that's just the tip of the iceberg.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." vie this year for the first
best animated feature Oscar, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
pays tribute Thursday night to Pixar Animation Studios. John
Lasseter, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker and the company's
executive vice president of creative, will participate in a survey of
Pixar's celebrated features and shorts, as well as a
question-and-answer period hosted by "Good Morning America" film
critic Joel Siegel.</LD>
<TE>   Considering that 26 of the last 30 films nominated for a visual
effects Oscar used Pixar's Academy Award-winning RenderMan software,
including "Gladiator," "The Matrix," "Titanic" and "Jurassic Park,"
you realize that the animation studio has been at the forefront of
the computer-generated imagery, or CGI revolution. "RenderMan has
become the industry standard [for taking computer-created shots and
seamlessly blending them with other footage] and is so flexible,"
said Lasseter, the director of Pixar's first three features: "Toy
Story," "A Bug's Life" and "Toy Story 2." He thinks that 2001 was not
only an exciting year for computer animation, varied in both style
and subject matter, but that it was also a banner one for blending
computer animation with live action.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Lasseter takes pride in the fact that "Monsters, Inc."
has surpassed "Toy Story 2" as Pixar's top-grossing film, and that
three of last year's top CGI films used RenderMan: "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone" and "Pearl Harbor." "So many people are using our tool in ways
that we never would've thought of. As I've always said, art
challenges technology and technology inspires the art."</TE>
<TE>   But it's always been that way at Pixar, which originated as the
computer division of Lucasfilm, before Apple co-founder Steve Jobs
purchased it for $10 million in 1986 and renamed the company.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar initially consisted of co-founders Jobs, Lasseter (a onetime
Disney animator) and computer graphics and software guru Ed Catmull.
Later, when the company expanded beyond computer hardware and
software into shorts and commercials, two very talented filmmakers
were brought in: Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter. Stanton went on to
co-direct "A Bug's Life" and is currently directing the upcoming
"Finding Nemo," and Docter directed "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   The shorts, however, have been a testing ground from the start.
They include "Luxo Jr.," about father-and-son lamps, which earned an
Oscar nomination for best animated short; "Tin Toy," about a baby
that terrorizes its toys, which won Pixar's first Oscar; "Geri's
Game," about an unusual chess match, which earned its second Oscar;
and "For the Birds," the latest about some cruel feathered foes that
get a hilarious comeuppance.</TE>
<TE>   While Jobs and Lasseter have the highest public profile, they have
a lot of help running the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve and John are two charismatic people who inspire others,
while I'm the quiet one," said Catmull, who was recently named
president of Pixar and now oversees its internal organization as well
as its technology. "Steve is hands-off at Pixar but handles Wall
Street and Disney and tells you to never be safe. John is effusive
and a very good listener."</TE>
<TE>   Lasseter, who says he's thankful he didn't have to learn computer
programming, thinks of Catmull as his mentor. At Lucasfilm, Catmull
managed digital film and sound editing, as well as computer graphics
and games, but his goal always was to make computer-animated
features. From Lasseter's perspective, "Lucasfilm had the cream of
the crop in computer graphics research, and I asked Ed how they did
it. He said, 'I always hire people smarter than myself.' I was
inspired by that philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   After Jobs bought the company, Catmull insisted that the technical
and creative people share equal power and fraternize with one
another. He contends that the pioneering spirit keeps Pixar
prospering. "If we ever figure it out, people will get bored and
screw things up on purpose."</TE>
<TE>   In the future, Catmull says he would like to continue streamlining
the hierarchy and lower the tremendous cost of making
computer-animated features so it's easier to take risks. On the
creative side, Catmull says diverse subject matter and outsiders such
as director Brad Bird ("Iron Giant") will help keep the films from
becoming formulaic.</TE>
<TE>   Lasseter says Pixar can concentrate on content since it has
developed most of the technical aspects of computer animation. "Rich
color, dimensional form, stylization. It becomes part of you, and
when you choose a subject matter for a film, it lends itself to the
medium."</TE>
<TE>   Toys made the perfect subjects for Pixar's first computer-animated
feature because of their plastic look (the more organic you get, the
harder it is to "describe" to a computer)--because Lasseter is a toy
fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   "'Toy Story' started out as an experiment because it seemed like a
relatively inexpensive film to make compared to our animated films at
the time," according to Michael Eisner, chairman and CEO of the Walt
Disney Co., Pixar's partner on all its features. However, even though
Pixar wrote the graphics programming for Disney's Oscar-winning
Computer Aided Production System back in 1986, allowing pencil
drawings to be scanned into the computer, painted and then digitally
merged with backgrounds, Eisner agrees with others that the key to
Pixar's success is not technology. "It's the creativity and the
storytelling," Eisner said. "John is right up there with [Steven]
Spielberg and [George] Lucas as a filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   Lasseter is very proud of Pixar's storytelling prowess--it's a
mantra within his ranks. "We're entertaining the audience, so the
technology is used to inspire us. On 'Monsters,' we challenged
technology to do fur. In the past, it never looked quite real. We
wanted the look to be great and be invisible to the animator. As they
were testing fur, they used a hairy sphere. It became a character in
the film. In 'Bug's Life,' we wanted to do a raindrop landing on the
ground next to an ant. It evolved the whole story line because of how
cool it looked."</TE>
<TE>   But despite the company's huge success, storytelling has never
come easily at Pixar, and every feature has been shut down at some
point to solve script problems. In "Toy Story," the characters
initially were meaner and not likable enough; in "Toy Story 2," the
characters' emotions didn't come easily; in "A Bug's Life" the plot
was originally too hard to follow; and in "Monsters, Inc.," the
concept of what's beyond the closet door to scare kids wasn't
substantial enough.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the final results, you realize these are far more
sophisticated than mere cartoons: "Toy Story" is about feeling
abandoned when you're past your prime; "Toy Story 2" continues
Woody's conflict by offering him the choice between hollow
immortality and momentary human contact; "A Bug's Life" is about
empowerment; and "Monster's, Inc." is about overcoming fears and
accepting parental responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Catmull says Pixar's awareness of the significance of storytelling
can be attributed ultimately to "Tin Toy." "When the baby walked up
to the couch and the toys cowered underneath, we realized that the
adults laughed and the kids didn't," he said. "And when the baby fell
over, the kids laughed and the adults didn't. That taught us how to
achieve the physical layer for children and the cerebral layer for
adults."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Midway between the Metropolitan Museum and the Guggenheim, a line has
been forming a few days a week at the Beaux Arts mansion on the
corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. The Neue Galerie, the first
U.S. museum devoted exclusively to German and Austrian modern art,
opened in November, but it's still drawing crowds.</LD>
<LD>   And 30 blocks downtown, next to the Museum of Modern Art, another
recent arrival is packing them in: the sleek new headquarters of the
American Folk Art Museum on 53rd Street.</LD>
<LD>   Both have been welcomed with open arms by New Yorkers and
tourists, not to mention appreciative reviewers.</LD>
<TE>   The Neue Galerie--which takes its name from a Vienna gallery that
showed avant-garde work in the 1920s--is the dream of not one, but
two great collectors: billionaire Ronald Lauder and art dealer Serge
Sabarsky. Together they bought and refurbished the five-story
landmark on Museum Mile for some $20 million, and stocked it with
their vast holdings of German and Austrian paintings, drawings,
furniture and decorative arts.</TE>
<TE>   The result, according to a review in the New York Times, "is
little short of superb."</TE>
<TE>   Originally designed by Carrere &amp; Hastings (architects of the New
York Public Library), the 1914 mansion once belonged to socialite
Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt. German-born architect Annabelle Selldorf
restored its original marble and wood decor and added Viennese-style
lamps and signage, maintaining the feel and the size of an elegant
in-town home--its maximum occupancy is just 375 people (at least one
source of the admission lines).</TE>
<TE>   On the first floor, the paneled parlor facing Fifth Avenue has
become Cafe Sabarsky, a homage to the Viennese fin de siecle replete
with bentwood chairs and a menu including chestnut soup, schnitzel
and pastries. Across the lobby is a bookstore and design shop. Floors
two and three house the first exhibition, "New Worlds: German and
Austrian Art, 1890-1940" (through Feb. 18), from the Lauder and
Sabarsky collections; starting in March, the third floor will be set
aside for temporary exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Lauder, 57, a former ambassador to Austria, is chairman of Estee
Lauder International, the cosmetics empire established by his mother.
A prime mover in New York art and philanthropic circles, he is
currently chairman of the Museum of Modern Art. His own collecting
began in 1957 when he purchased an Egon Schiele drawing with his bar
mitzvah money.</TE>
<TE>   His friend and the museum's co-founder, Serge Sabarsky
(1912-1996), was an Austrian-born curator and dealer whose Upper East
Side gallery Lauder refers to as his "post-graduate course on
Austrian and German Expressionism."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. collectors have shied away from German and Austrian work
owing to its association with Nazism and the Holocaust, even though
many artists were themselves persecuted by the Nazis, who purged
"degenerate" Modernism from museums and Jewish collectors were among
their greatest patrons. It's not without a certain irony that the
Neue Galerie's co-founders are two Jews with ties to Austria:
Sabarsky's mother died at Auschwitz, and Lauder got a dose of
Austrian anti-Semitism during his ambassadorship, which coincided
with the repudiation of President Kurt Waldheim and his Nazi past.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Lauder has been amassing art. According to the Neue
Galerie, he has lent the museum 500 artworks and donated 100 more,
including the 1938 Max Beckmann self-portrait acquired for $22.5
million at Sotheby's last May. Another 800 pieces are on loan from
Sabarsky's foundation, giving the museum access to some 1,400 works
representing all the major figures and movements in 20th century
Austrian and German art.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural installation reveals the depth and quality of these
holdings. The second floor is all Austrian, beginning with a spacious
gilt-and-marble hall with six major oil portraits and landscapes by
Klimt, several canvases by Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka and Richard
Gerstl and a group of rare clocks. A oak-paneled salon facing Central
Park contains choice furniture and design objects. And a gallery for
works on paper permits close study of erotica and portraiture by
Schiele and Klimt.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the ornamental domestic splendor of the second
floor, the third has been stripped down to three spare Bauhaus-style
white-walled galleries dedicated to German art. There are
Expressionist paintings by Wassily Kandinsky, Emil Nolde, Ernst
Ludwig Kirchner and Franz Marc, unforgiving portraits and
self-portraits by such artists as George Grosz and Otto Dix and a
selection of now-classic tube-steel chairs, tables, electric fans and
wall clocks by Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe, Peter Behrens and
other architects.</TE>
<TE>   Lauder is proud of his creation but he gives his late mentor his
due. "This museum is about Serge's vision, about his love of art," he
says, "and about our friendship."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Folk Art Museum's first permanent home is a
$22-million tower designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects
(the New York firm that built the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla
in 1995). And with signature imagery de rigueur in museum design
these days, the Folk Art Museum weighs in with a facade that
architecture critics are already calling iconic: a six-story, 85-foot
moonscape of cratered cast-metal panels. A slit window down the
middle and a triangle folded down at the top like an inverted
pediment form a composition that looks a little like the end of a
gift-wrapped package ... from Mars.</TE>
<TE>   This is a decidedly unfolksy building, more opulent urban
Modernism than homespun country craft. Inside there's a lot of
sandblasted concrete, polished metal and glass. The space is
dominated by a sky-lit atrium, with catwalks and staircases connected
the four levels of galleries. The tight layout caused the New York
Observer's Hilton Kramer to call it a cramped "vertical maze."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the compact structure, slotted into a 40-foot-by-100-foot
lot, manages to quadruple the 41-year-old museum's rent-free space
near Lincoln Center, which it has occupied since 1989 (it has become
an annex), bringing to light some 500 works from the underexposed
4,000-piece collection.</TE>
<TE>   What exactly is "folk art"? According to director Gerard C.
Wertkin, in the Old World the term applied to peasant household
traditional arts, but for the Modernists who carved out the field in
the U.S. in the 1920s, the key criterion was not class or ethnicity,
but artistic training outside the institutional structures of the art
world. Homemade objects created by these "self-taught" or "outsider"
artists usually have a lot to do with identity. Whether functional or
not, they tend also to be highly decorative, with symbolic elements
and a dollop or two of sincerity, naivete or whimsy.</TE>
<TE>   The great strength of the collection is sculpture--from shop signs
to weather vanes--as well as American quilts and watercolors. But
there are also paintings, pottery, furniture, needlework and more,
all made in the U.S. from the 17th century to the present.</TE>
<TE>   For its opening display, the museum is showing 400-plus objects
that board chairman Ralph Esmerian has promised to the museum. A
fourth-generation dealer in gemstones, Esmerian, 61, has contributed
time, art and money to the museum for the last 25 years. "His impact
has been enormous," says director Wertkin.</TE>
<TE>   Esmerian has favored Pennsylvania German artworks, including
watercolor portraits of couples in domestic settings by Jacob
Maentel, and the colorful birth certificates and keepsake documents
collectively called "frakturs." But there are highlights of all
kinds: a life-size tin man in top hat and tails, made around 1930 for
the window of a New York City sheet metal and roofing works; the
painting "Girl in a Red Dress With a Cat and a Dog" by Ammi Phillips,
for which Esmerian paid $1 million in 1984, setting a record for a
work of American folk art--you may have seen it on a U.S. postage
stamp--and "The Peaceable Kingdom," by Pennsylvania Quaker Edward
Hicks, one of 62 versions of the subject.</TE>
<TE>   A second show focuses on Henry Darger, a Chicago recluse who died
in 1973 having worked for 60 years on a 15,000-page epic about
battles between an imaginary clan of nude children and their
child-enslaving adult nemeses. On display are the typed
single-spaced, hand-bound volumes of the manuscript, along with 26 of
Darger's own watercolor illustrations--double-sided scrolls, some 9
feet in length, displayed in eye-level Plexiglas cases designed by
exhibition consultant Ralph Appelbaum.</TE>
<TE>   The museum squeezes a lot into a building as wide as a private
townhouse, including a small cafe and a shop. Wertkin says the
"domestic" scale suits the material on view.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has truly embraced the museum," says Wertkin,
gratified by burgeoning attendance and the buzz his museum has
generated. "It speaks to unalloyed Americanism. So many objects on
display are deeply rooted in, and speak to, the country's democratic
values--its openness, diversity, the fact that everyone's invited to
the table.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll always speak to every community in the body politic," he
says. "This is what the museum has always been about."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandon Tartikoff loved the spotlight. The late NBC Entertainment
president showed up on sitcoms, talk shows, even hosted "Saturday
Night Live." His press conferences could be equally theatrical,
including one during which he literally swore on a stack of Bibles
not to order more specials hosted by Geraldo Rivera--a policy that
Fox News Channel, come to think of it, might be well advised to
consider.</LD>
<LD>   Some of Tartikoff's successors harbor a similar fondness for
seeing their names in print and faces on television but approach the
process more warily--in part, one suspects, because of increased
exposure in popular media of corporate "suits," who keep spilling
into the public eyes in a less-than-flattering (and mostly
nearsighted) manner.</LD>
<LD>   This bears mention as TV critics and reporters from around the
country descend on Pasadena to preview new shows, part of a
twice-annual ritual some network honchos have come to view with the
sort of enthusiasm usually reserved for a development meeting with a
former "Seinfeld" co-star.</LD>
<TE>   Then again, perhaps that's because the criticism leveled at them
has become more pointed and personal, beginning with a new Olympic
sport that involved pummeling ABC Entertainment Television Group
co-chairmen Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun, at least figuratively, for
crimes against television.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg lost his job Monday after months of rumors--a move that
couldn't have come too soon, based on the press coverage. Writing in
the trade paper Electronic Media, Tom Shales skewered the
alliterative duo for having "compounded failure with failure and
brought the network to new lows." Not to be outdone, San Francisco
Chronicle critic Tim Goodman dubbed them "the worst executives of the
year," citing their "lack of vision, unmerited smugness and the
stubbornness necessary to drive ABC into the ground."</TE>
<TE>   While such shortcomings can be documented based on ratings and
programming choices, Goodman went a step further, accusing the pair
of being snotty to the press, of all people, by exhibiting "an
effortless disdain for television critics." Now, slapping Bloomberg
and Braun around for putting on "Bob Patterson" is one thing, but for
sneering at critics? If the adulation for Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld's terse press conferences is any indication, that's the kind
of offense that garners applause, not convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, examination of executive failings hasn't stopped at the
edge of TV columns, where it once did. After Braun suggested that
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" might not be around next fall, host
Regis Philbin went on his morning talk show and paraphrased "The
Godfather Part II" by noting that this was the business he had
chosen, the implication being that dealing with horrible people comes
with the territory.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Stern also devoted time on his morning radio show to
ridiculing the ABC executives, having previously trashed the
programming acumen of CBS Television President Leslie Moonves, whose
principal offense, apparently, was having the temerity to drop
Stern's Saturday night TV freak show.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Moonves became a comedic foil for CBS' resident
late-night ingrate David Letterman, who ran an ongoing gag about a
visit to Cuba during which Moonves dined with Fidel Castro.
Letterman's best line: "This lunch must have been quite something. On
the one hand, you have this ruthless dictator surrounded by sniveling
yes men, and then on the other hand, of course, you have Fidel
Castro."</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night Live" joined in biting the hands that feed it with
a cartoon spoofing NBC's ill-fated efforts to boost ratings for the
since-departed sitcom "Emeril," picturing executives Scott Sassa and
Jeff Zucker burying the chef in rats.</TE>
<TE>   What average viewers make of this inside-the-(Hollywood)-Beltway
humor is anybody's guess. For starters, one has to wonder what
percentage of Stern's listeners or Philbin's viewers is supposed to
care, though such griping does allow these millionaire hosts to bond
with the audience, depicting themselves as downtrodden working-class
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Directing broadsides at "the network" is hardly new. Johnny Carson
tweaked NBC management before Letterman elevated thumbing one's nose
at authority to high art, alluding to "GE weasels" after General
Electric acquired the network in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, heightened fascination with the entertainment
industry's inner workings has made such material more common and
barbed, in part because there is simply more analysis of everything
in our modern media age. In that context, network executives must
accept that feeding a hungry press has become as much a part of the
job as courting talent and choosing scripts, with lapses by ABC to be
found on all three fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The one real problem with most of the blather about network suits
is that it tends to be somewhat myopic, seeing only the tip of the
corporate iceberg that is the modern sprawling mega-media
conglomerate, which can result in the bashing of the wrong weasels.
Although Braun and Bloomberg made obvious targets, for example, they
turn up on the corporate flowchart under three presidents (the ABC TV
Network's Alex Wallau, ABC Broadcast Group's Steve Bornstein and
Disney's Robert Iger) even before one gets to hands-on Walt Disney
Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, who has gone through senior management
the way Wile E. Coyote goes through Acme products.</TE>
<TE>   So while it's easy to lampoon ABC's B&amp;B boys for their lousy aim,
they weren't operating without permission (and, in some instances,
they were under orders) from those higher up the food chain. That
said, don't hold your breath waiting for one of today's corporate
officers to publicly say, "Well, yes, that was a stupid idea, but my
boss made me do it."</TE>
<TE>   It's also only fair to point out that for all ABC's boneheaded
decisions and ham-fisted handling of press and talent relations
(irking not only Philbin but also Barbara Walters and "NYPD Blue"
producer Steven Bochco), ABC isn't the only network with headaches.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's difficulty in coming up with new comedies persists, as
"Emeril" and "Inside Schwartz" demonstrate; Fox has launched plenty
of duds; and new CBS programs have mostly limped through the fall,
with three canceled and high-profile vehicles for Ellen DeGeneres
("The Ellen Show") and Richard Dreyfuss ("The Education of Max
Bickford") looking shaky.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a respite from criticizing network executives to
second-guess their critics is an unusually generous gesture for this
column, but chalk it up to a weak moment of nostalgia. Because
watching ABC officials impersonate ducks in a shooting gallery, it's
hard not to imagine that if Tartikoff were in the line of fire he'd
somehow make a game of it, and Rumsfeld's briefings wouldn't be the
only show in town drawing rave reviews.</TE>

<LD>   McEnroe to Host a Self-Control Show</LD>
<LD>   Tennis great John McEnroe has been signed to host a game show for
ABC, "The Chair."</LD>
<TE>   McEnroe, who has had a successful career as a TV sports
commentator, is an interesting choice for the role. Though he has 154
singles and doubles titles behind him, he's never been known for
self-control. And self-control is the premise of the program, in
which contestants have to answer questions correctly while keeping
their heart rates in tow. If a player's pulse soars beyond the
prescribed range, all the money he or she has won disappears and no
new questions are posed until the contestant is once again calm.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chair" is produced by Touchstone Television and will debut
later this season.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-'Big Brother' Contestant in Trouble</TE>
<TE>   A "Big Brother" contestant who was kicked off the show in July for
holding a knife to a woman's throat is facing charges that he
assaulted his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Sebik, 27, was arrested in Bayonne, N.J., Monday after
police reported finding a woman on a street there about 2 a.m. with a
broken ankle and choke marks around her neck. He was released on
$1,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sebik] choked her and threw her on the ground, causing her to
fracture her ankle," according to a police report.</TE>
<TE>   Sebik predicted that the charge would be dismissed because it was
the result of a misunderstanding. He said his girlfriend and he were
breaking up and she fell down trying to take a swipe at him.</TE>
<TE>   And the "Big Brother" incident? Only joking, he maintains. While
he was kissing another contestant, he pulled the knife and asked if
she'd mind if he killed her. She laughed, he said, and resumed the
embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Could a Gay Channel Be Coming to TV?</TE>
<TE>   Viacom's MTV and Showtime are in "serious discussions" about
launching a TV channel aimed at gays and lesbians, TV Guide columnist
J. Max Robins reports.</TE>
<TE>   He cites industry sources as saying there have been similar
discussions at HBO, USA Networks and the Rainbow Media, the
programming arm of Cablevision, which runs Bravo and AMC.</TE>
<TE>   "[A gay channel] is being given real consideration," a Viacom
insider tells Robins. "Look at the success Showtime has with
programming 'Queer as Folk.' And MTV has a long history of being out
in front on gay issues and marketing to that community."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time somebody had gone after that audience with a
network," says Tom Wolzien, senior media analyst at the investment
firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "The money is certainly there to
support it."</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Museum Attendance Soars with Free Entry</TE>
<TE>   Figures released Monday show that twice as many people have
visited national museums in Britain since admissions were abolished
last month.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround came despite the decrease in tourism after the
Sept. 11 attacks and in a year when fears of foot and mouth disease
also kept foreign tourists away.</TE>
<TE>   Culture secretary Tessa Jowell termed the free entry policy "an
enormous success."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting a museum has, once again, become "one of life's free
pleasures, like a stroll in the park," she told London's Guardian.
"Clearly, charges were acting as a restraint to many people,
particularly families. Two adults visiting the new British galleries
[at the Victoria and Albert Museum] would have had to pay [$14.40]
before free admission."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers, the newspaper points out, do not take into account
the reported surge in visitors to museums such as the Tate, National
and the National Portrait galleries, which were already free.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Some Don't 'Like It Hot'--or 'Nutty'</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment retailer Virgin has run into trouble in Beirut,
where police seized tapes and DVDs of hundred of movies, including
"Some Like It Hot," "The Nutty Professor" and "The Great Escape."</TE>
<TE>   The manager of the shop from which they were taken--which the
government said was proof of Lebanon's liberalism and ability to
attract investment when it opened last year--spent most of the
following two days in police detention.</TE>
<TE>   Lebanon's General Security department issued a statement saying
the material offends faith and public morals, contains talk that
"encourages youngsters to commit suicide" and violates Arab boycott
laws against Israel, which are vague and rarely enforced.</TE>
<TE>   "We are amazed," the store's management said in a statement.
"Lebanese television stations broadcast most of the confiscated DVDs
over and over."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   HBO has begun pre-production on "Alexander the Great" based on
Mary Renault's novels "Fire From Heaven" and "The Persian Boy." The
10-part miniseries is slated to air in 2004.... Muhammad Ali will
receive the Freedom Award from the Broadcast Film Critics Assn. at
its awards dinner Friday at the Beverly Hills Hotel.... In
anticipation of UCLA's Saturday showdown with the No. 1 college
basketball team, the Kansas Jayhawks, "The Late Late Show With Craig
Kilborn" is saluting the Bruins tonight. UCLA students will compose
much of the audience and the school's cheerleaders will perform on
the CBS program, which airs at 12:35 a.m.... John Miller, ABC's
terrorism expert, will join Barbara Walters as co-anchor of "20/20"
when the show returns to its Friday 10 p.m. time slot on Jan. 18....
Cirque du Soleil's "Dralion," seen in Santa Monica and Irvine in late
1999, will play the Queen Mary parking lot in Long Beach, opening
March 6, then move to the Del Mar Fairgrounds north of San Diego,
opening April 18.... ABC has ordered an additional 13 episodes of
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which airs Fridays at 8 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Spirit Awards Tilt Toward True Independence</HD>
<DH>This year's nominations mostly steer clear of mainstream
titles. Such choices were criticized in the past. The winners will be
announced March 23.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nominations for the Independent Spirit Awards were announced Tuesday
with a mix of well-known, critically acclaimed films such as "In the
Bedroom" and "Memento" joining edgier and more controversial films
such as "L.I.E." and "The Believer" among the nominations.</LD>
<LD>   The films in the running for best feature are "Hedwig and the
Angry Inch," based on John Cameron Mitchell's popular cross-gender
musical; "L.I.E.," a drama about a child molester; "Memento," a
quirky thriller about memory loss; "Things Behind the Sun," Allison
Anders' semiautobiographical story about rape; and Richard
Linklater's animated philosophical feature "Waking Life."</LD>
<LD>   Some in the independent film community were critical of the Spirit
Awards in past years because many of the nominations included more
mainstream, higher-budget films that were also nominated for Oscars
and other honors. But this year the jury appears to have selected
more independent fare, nominating some films that have not even been
distributed--if a film shows at a festival, it is eligible for a
Spirit Award--or that were released only for a limited time.</LD>
<TE>   "This year's nominees especially represent the diversity and range
of unique voices and artistic vision," said Dawn Hudson, executive
director of Independent Feature Project West.</TE>
<TE>   Nominations for best first feature are "The Anniversary Party," a
satire about self-indulgent Hollywood types; "The Believer," about a
Jewish man who becomes a neo-Nazi; "Donnie Darko," an offbeat family
drama with supernatural elements; "Ghost World," a dark comedy about
two disaffected teens; and the family drama "In the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   For best female lead, Kim Dickens was nominated for her work in
"Things Behind the Sun," Molly Parker for "The Center of the World,"
Sissy Spacek for "In the Bedroom," Tilda Swinton for "The Deep End"
and Kerry Washington for "Lift."</TE>
<TE>   In the best male lead category, Brian Cox was nominated for
"L.I.E.," Ryan Gosling for "The Believer," Jake Gyllenhaal for
"Donnie Darko," Mitchell for "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" and Tom
Wilkinson for "In the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Best supporting female actor nominees are Davenia McFadden for
"Stranger Inside," Carrie-Anne Moss for "Memento," Summer Phoenix for
"The Believer," Tamara Tunie for "The Caveman's Valentine" and Uma
Thurman for "Tape."</TE>
<TE>   For best supporting male actors, Steve Buscemi was nominated for
"Ghost World," Don Cheadle for "Things Behind the Sun," Billy Kay for
"L.I.E.," Garrett Morris for "Jackpot" and John C. Reilly for "The
Anniversary Party."</TE>
<TE>   The awards ceremony, to be held March 23, one day before the
Academy Awards, is sponsored by IFP West, a nonprofit group that
assists independent filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, as the independent film world gained clout, so did
the Spirit Awards. When it began 17 years ago, the ceremony was an
intimate affair held at a restaurant for a few hundred guests.</TE>
<TE>   Today it has exploded into a major media event, with several
thousand people invited for a fancy lunch under a tent at a Santa
Monica beach.</TE>

<HD>Nakamura Introduces His Campy Seductions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an understatement to say that San Francisco-based producer Dan
"The Automator" Nakamura has a thing for high concept. He put his
sonic thumbprint on alt-rap icon Kool Keith's lascivious "Dr.
Octagon" character, co-created the mock-suave Handsome Boy Modeling
School with fellow conceptualist Prince Paul and dreamed up cartoon
hip-hop act Gorillaz with such collaborators as Blur's Damon Albarn
and Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday at the House of Blues, Nakamura took his latest project
to the stage for the first time. Appearing as his Modeling School
persona, Nathaniel Merriweather, he presented the tongue-in-cheek
seduction sounds of "Lovage: Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By,"
a potent fusion of cocktail-culture mating rituals and thoroughly
modern mixology.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a silky bathrobe alongside pajama-clad turntablist Kid
Koala, Nakamura presided genially over an hour of ethereal trip-hop
blended with smooth soul grooves and spiked with dashes of R&amp;B, Latin
and blues. Also backed by bassist Merlo Podlewski and guitarist
Brandon Armovick (who changed from a tux to a g-string to a
Spider-Man suit as the set progressed), playboy-attired vocalist Mike
Patton (ex-Faith No More and Mr. Bungle) and sultry, slip-clad singer
Jennifer Charles (Elysian Fields) traded elliptical he-said/she-said
come-ons in such selections as the languidly propulsive "(Pit Stop)
Take Me Home."</LD>
<TE>   Projected video bits alternately amped up the campy sexual vibe
(soft-core porn clips) and undercut it (the Big-Boy-in-drag seduction
scene from "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"). During a couple of breaks,
the players milled about on stage, sipping from cognac glasses while
Kid Koala DJ'd on.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you were actually looking for music to make love to
your old lady by, you might have found the show arch to a fault. But,
then again, what good is sweet love if you can't have a little fun
too?</TE>

<HD>Have Baton, Will Travel</HD>
<DH>Young conductor Roberto Minczuk's musical odyssey has taken
him from Brazil to Europe and New York, and now Costa Mesa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall (practice, practice,
practice) omits another crucial piece of advice. Be prepared to
travel.</LD>
<LD>   With a layover and a flight delay, for instance, conductor Roberto
Minczuk spent 20 hours traveling from South America to Costa Mesa to
lead the Pacific Symphony tonight and Thursday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   But he's not complaining. A second-generation Brazilian of Russian
descent, Minczuk has always been a jet-lagged citizen of the world.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm accustomed to it," the 34-year-old conductor said Monday. "I
don't mind traveling. If you take an overnight flight, you lose track
of what time it is."</TE>
<TE>   Minczuk brought along his wife, Valeria, and their three
children--Natalie, 9, Rebecca, 7, and Joshua, 4.</TE>
<TE>   "This is [the kids'] summer break," he said. "It's winter in
America, but it's summer in Brazil. They will be with me the whole
time I'm in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Although he's coming to conduct, Minczuk began his musical career
as a French horn prodigy, landing the principal horn position of the
Sao Paulo Symphony when he was 16.</TE>
<TE>   He was the fifth of eight children, all of whom studied music. He
played trumpet and horn in the Russian Assembly of God church where
his father was music minister.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I was very young, my father used to say, 'One day you
will have to take over and conduct,'" he said. "When I came to
America, I was a teenager--14--I was already thinking about
conducting."</TE>
<TE>   But first he had to overcome the popular belief in Brazil that
people become conductors only because they can't play any instrument
well. "I had to be a great instrumentalist before I began to be a
conductor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He won a number of competitions, played at Carnegie Hall at 16,
made a solo appearance with the New York Youth Symphony at 17 and
graduated from the Juilliard School in New York at 20.</TE>
<TE>   Studying on full scholarship at Juilliard, he also formed and
conducted an orchestra at a Ukrainian Assembly of God church where he
worshiped. "I was following in my father's footsteps by also writing
music and orchestrating and teaching music for the church," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, he joined the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led
by Kurt Masur in then-East Germany. Minczuk was the only foreigner in
the orchestra. He stayed two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Music was the most important thing in Leipzig back then. If you
were a member of the orchestra, it was like being a football player
in Dallas. A Dallas Cowboy. That's the respect they had for the
musicians. Everywhere you went, you were treated differently."</TE>
<TE>   But he felt the pull of his native country.</TE>
<TE>   "Being of Russian background, born in Brazil, studying in the
United States and living in East Germany, it was an interesting mix,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I felt I should go back home. I had been away for eight years
already. Those were very important years, the teenage years when you
start developing your ideas about life, politics and who you are."</TE>
<TE>   He played horn, returned to the church where he met his wife (they
just celebrated their 10th anniversary) and composed gospel music. He
also studied with Brazilian conductor Eleazar de Carvalho, who was a
protege of Serge Koussevitzky and who returned to his homeland after
a career in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very fortunate because right away I was able to have my own
orchestra, the University of Brasilia Orchestra," Minczuk said. "As a
conductor, you will only develop when you have an instrument. That
was what Brazil was able to give me, which could have been a little
more difficult in another place."</TE>
<TE>   His appointment there quickly led to the post of artistic director
of the Orchestra of Ribeirao Preto, which he has held since 1995, and
his association since 1997 with the Sao Paulo State Symphony, where
he is now also co-artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   He might have remained in Brazil for quite a while except that
Masur heard him conduct while he and the orchestra were on a tour.
Masur invited him to audition as an assistant conductor for the New
York Philharmonic, a job that didn't require him to live in the city
because the post was shared by several people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minczuk was an assistant at the orchestra from 1997 until 2000,
making his debut with the orchestra in the Summer Park concert series
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were very successful concerts," he said. "I was able to get
good reviews and I was approached by several managers, and they
started representing me in the United States and in Europe, and this
is how I got going."</TE>
<TE>   After Costa Mesa, he'll be conducting in Denver, Indianapolis,
Seattle, Fort Worth, Detroit and other U.S. cities as well as
returning to launch the Sao Paulo season in March.</TE>
<TE>   His Pacific Symphony program will include the Polovtsian Dances
from Borodin's "Prince Igor," Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto (with
soloist Lilya Zilberstein) and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade."</TE>
<TE>   "I love this combination of pieces," he said. "I can't deny my
background and my attachment to this music. This repertoire is very
traditional, but it fits well together. And we--the musicians and the
audience--can never tire of this great music."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Minczuk will lead the Pacific Symphony in music by
Borodin, Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov tonight and Thursday at 8 p.m.
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive,
Costa Mesa. Lilya Zilberstein solos in Prokofiev's Third Piano
Concerto. $21 to $56. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>Tough Choices Season 'Soul Food'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh from securing a 40-episode commitment from the Showtime cable
network, the drama series "Soul Food" serves up the first of its new
batch of shows at 10 tonight, "From Dreams to Nightmares."</LD>
<LD>   Like the best episodes of the drama's two-season run, "Dreams"
throws its characters curves when they're looking for fastballs. The
theme swirls around the hard choices necessary in the real world.</LD>
<LD>   Lem (Darren Dewitt Henson) has been accused of burning down the
family store, and despite his claims of innocence, he's been jailed
while awaiting trial. His family rallies around him, but because of
bad decisions in his past, some wisps of doubt creep in. Lem's
teenage nephew, Ahmad (Aaron Meeks), begins having terrifying dreams
of imprisonment, and his father, Kenny (Rockmond Dunbar), sits him
down for a one-on-one about the choices the boy must make to avoid a
similar fate.</LD>
<TE>   Damon (Boris Kodjoe), meanwhile, appears to have it all going his
way when he's offered a chance to represent a star hockey player
(John-Patrick Mavric), an opportunity that could jump-start his
career as an agent. But the player wastes no time asking Damon for
help concocting smoke screens to keep his pregnant wife (Angela Vint)
in the dark about his cheating ways.</TE>
<TE>   Damon reluctantly complies, and he's soon introduced to other
athletes who might further bolster his client list. But guilt eats at
him as his lies pile up.</TE>
<TE>   He decides to take a stand and in return is given an
ultimatum--keep up the charade or lose the client of a lifetime. In
"Soul Food," as in life, there are no easy answers.</TE>

<KH>Sundance Festival</KH>
<HD>'Business as Usual' Has Lost Its Top Billing</HD>
<DH>This year's entries include made-for-TV films; the dates
and the weather are out of kilter; and even the local moose are at
risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever else people say about the Sundance Film Festival--and they
say quite a lot--it's an event that's been known for its
dependability. Up to now. Be prepared to think of Sundance 2002 as
the Sundance of dislocation, displacement and business not as usual.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, this festival, which marks the 20th anniversary of
Robert Redford's sponsoring Sundance Institute, is happening a week
earlier than usual so that the host town of Park City, Utah, can be
cleared of moviegoers and tidied up in time for the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Also a switch for this champion of independent theatrical
filmmaking, both the festival's opening night premiere on Thursday in
Salt Lake City ("The Laramie Project," based on the celebrated play)
and its prestigious Centerpiece premiere (Mira Nair's "Hysterical
Blindness") were made not for theaters but for the increasingly
powerful HBO network.</LD>
<TE>   And on the documentary side, five of the 16 films in competition
arrive with the imprimatur of the feisty Independent Television
Service, which is funded by Congress to present features that
"involve creative risks and address the needs of underserved
audiences."</TE>
<TE>   As if the festival did not already have a welter of overlapping
sections, they've added another, splitting off something called
American Showcase from American Spectrum, which was in turn split off
from the dramatic competition. Anyone who can convincingly explain
why a given film belongs in Showcase rather than Spectrum, Premieres,
the competition or any other division is eligible for a free bucket
of popcorn at the Holiday Village triplex.</TE>
<TE>   Those trying to collect on that offer, however, are due for yet
another shock. The shabby-chic Holiday triplex, one of Sundance's
most venerable venues, will be out of commission, the victim of a
renovation that (surprise) didn't manage to finish on time, leaving
the festival to scramble to come up with three new theatrical spaces
to take its place.</TE>
<TE>   Also determined to be different is the Park City weather. Though
the festival has been relatively precipitation-free for the last few
years, news reports say that this winter has seen so much snow that
Interstate 80, the road between Salt Lake and Park City, has been the
scene of numerous collisions between unwary motorists and very large
and hungry moose. A word to the wise.</TE>
<TE>   Just as unsettling are advance reports that the festival, possibly
worried about the potential for terrorism, is forbidding anything but
messages in the mailboxes of festival participants. No more chocolate
cell phones, no more plastic tongue cleaners, no more Armenian
pastries, no more condoms in American flag wrappings, no more
anything entrepreneurially intended to promote a given film. Art will
apparently have to go it alone this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some things about Sundance, however, do not change. The Premieres
section is still reserved for anyone with a recognizable name, from
veteran director Victor Nunez ("Ulee's Gold"), here with his new film
"Coastlines," to documentarian-provocateur Nick Broomfield ("Heidi
Fleiss: Hollywood Madam") and his "L.A. Story," a look at the
murderous rivalries of the rap world.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Premieres is Robin Williams in what is said to be a
non-Patch Adams role in "One Hour Photo"; "The Kid Stays in the
Picture," a documentary on resilient Hollywood producer Robert Evans;
and "The Dancer Upstairs," a feature directed by John Malkovich and
starring Javier Bardem in Nicholas Shakespeare's adaptation of his
own book on revolutionary activity in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most outright entertaining of the Premieres is
"Birthday Girl," which stars Ben Chaplin as a timid British bank
clerk who procures a Russian mail-order bride and ends up, in Nicole
Kidman's Nadia, with someone who's so much more than he can handle
that saying so doesn't say the half of it. British director Jez
Butterworth, who co-wrote with his brother Tom, has come up with an
adventurous film that adroitly remixes genre elements and unexpected
performances to pleasing effect.</TE>
<TE>   World Cinema Section Promises Fine Films</TE>
<TE>   If these films have some familiarity to them, the ones in the
dramatic competition are, as usual, almost completely unknown
quantities and, if anything, tend to sound a bit more on the edge
this year. The word from the Sundance brain trust is that these works
are "eccentric," which may or may not be code for "unwatchable."</TE>
<TE>   Invariably the home of fine films is the World Cinema section. One
of the best, Laurent Cantet's "Time Out," is from France and, like
its predecessor, "Human Resources," concerns itself with the
centrality of work to life. It's a thoughtful, exceptionally subtle
psychological drama about an ordinary man who creates an increasingly
elaborate and fantastical imaginary work experience for himself to
avoid telling his family he's been fired. Aurelien Recoing gives a
nervy, insinuating performance as an impostor whose deceptions start
to take over his life.</TE>
<TE>   Though it perennially has to fight off its stepchild image,
American Spectrum invariably has films worth watching.
Writer-director Karen Moncrieff's "Blue Car," for instance, is
notable for young Agnes Bruckner's heartfelt breakthrough performance
as a high school student from a broken home who is encouraged to
pursue poetry by a male English teacher</TE>
<TE>   Pound for pound, as the old boxing writers used to say, the most
reliable section at Sundance continues to be the documentary
competition. Some of this year's most interesting include:</TE>
<TE>   * "Amandla! A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony," which outlines the
part song played as both a lifter of spirits and an aid to organizing
in the movement against apartheid in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   * "Close to Home," a wrenching film, as important as it is
difficult to watch, that deals with the devastation of childhood
sexual abuse. The documentary consists of interviews with adult
survivors of abuse, children who are just now confronting their
experience and, most chilling, convicted offenders talking about
their strategies in group therapy sessions. As one of them explains,
"The predator isn't the guy in the bushes, picking up kids in the
schoolyard. Most child molesters are people in your lives."</TE>
<TE>   * "The Cockettes" is an engaging tribute to a theatrical troupe
that was the sensation of the late 1960s and early 1970s hippie
movement in San Francisco. They were, as John Waters describes them,
"hippie acid freak drag queens," and this sympathetic, straight-ahead
look at "people who were allowed to live at the end of their
imagination" is a charming and nostalgic revisiting of a lost corner
of recent cultural history.</TE>
<TE>   * "Derrida" is easily the most intellectually challenging
documentary in the competition. This look at the life and thought of
the French philosopher and father of deconstruction is also an
invigorating and refreshing tonic for tired minds. Made with Jacques
Derrida's cooperation and enhanced by a Ryuichi Sakamoto score, the
film is at its best when the man is being interviewed and his
powerful, agile intellect takes over. "Everything is fake in cinema
verite" is only one of many trenchant comments made about everything
from the myth of Echo and Narcissus to the sex lives of philosophers.</TE>
<TE>   * "Sister Helen" provides a glimpse inside a halfway house for
recovering addicts in the South Bronx that's run by a holy terror of
a 69-year-old Benedictine nun who is tough, sarcastic and
unapologetic in her quest to keep the 21 men in her program
substance-free.</TE>
<TE>   Even if there's nothing else you can count on this year, with
Sundance's documentaries you're always on solid ground.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of those cosmic jests that Nielsen occasionally plays, ABC
marked its first weekly ratings win of the season a day after letting
go the co-chairman of its entertainment group due to sluggish
prime-time ratings, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by
Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, entertainment was hardly responsible for the network's
victory, as prime-time coverage of college football combined with
holiday-timed reruns to put ABC over the top, ending CBS' eight-week
winning streak despite the biggest audience for "Survivor: Africa"
since its premiere. The third-edition finale of the CBS franchise
will run Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Even in victory, ABC had plenty of bad luck, as college football's
national championship game, played in the Rose Bowl, turned into a
one-sided affair, resulting in a 20% ratings decline versus the
corresponding telecast last year.</LD>
<TE>   NBC recorded another highlight for the "Law &amp; Order" franchise, as
"Special Victims Unit" posting a ratings record for the spinoff on
Friday. HBO, meanwhile, drew 7.3 million viewers for its midseason
return of "Sex and the City"--an extremely impressive number for the
pay service, which is received by less than a third of U.S. homes
with television.</TE>

<HD>Ford Rethinks Key Elements of Its Electric Commuter Vehicle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. has redesigned its plastic-bodied Think City commuter
car for a sleeker look and more creature comforts than the
Norwegian-built electric vehicle came with originally.</LD>
<LD>   The new look, which includes a carpeted cargo area instead of the
original Think's single-thickness, plastic-walled rear compartment,
was unveiled at the Los Angeles International Auto Show.</LD>
<LD>   Ford division President James O'Connor said the U.S. version of
the Think City also will have an improved top speed of 60 miles per
hour and come standard with air conditioning, power windows and an
AM-FM stereo with CD player.</LD>
<TE>   The two-seat car, designed for short trips, will retain its range
of 45 to 50 miles on a single charge, but will be recharged through a
conventional 115-volt household connection rather than the
harder-to-find 220-volt system the European model requires.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's Southland-based Think Mobility unit expects to begin
selling the City this summer at 50 dealerships throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing hasn't been set, but Think valued the European model at
$20,000 in a test lease program last year.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: The revamped Think City keeps the tall roof line and
large glass rear tailgate, but it also adds a separate side window in
the rear and softens the front end to eliminate the original design's
rather bug-eyed look.</CP>

<HD>Toyota Unveils a Sticker Shock With Its New Matrix</HD>
<DH>Pricing* Sport-utility wagon costs less than its twin, the
Pontiac Vibe, despite expectations that it would be more expensive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe sport-utility wagon twins
were launched, the supposition was that Toyota, as it usually does,
would charge the premium price.</LD>
<LD>   But Toyota, noted for valuing its name and ability to command top
dollar, has sprung a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   The company, it seems, realized such savings from manufacturing
its version of the car in Canada (the Pontiac is built near San Jose
in a plant jointly owned by Toyota and General Motors Corp.) that it
was able this week to publish a manufacturer's suggested price list
that shaves hundreds of dollars off the price for the similarly
equipped Pontiac Vibe.</LD>
<TE>   Pontiac, which has three versions of the Vibe--base, all-wheel
drive and GT--was first to announce pricing in mid-December. It set a
base of $16,900, including a $560 destination charge, for the
entry-level model with five-speed manual transmission.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's entry-level Matrix with manual transmission and a few
pieces of optional equipment that are standard on the Pontiac is
$15,435, including a $485 destination charge, according to a price
list published Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Toyota doesn't offer is a roof rack, which is standard

<HD>Car Shows Rev Up Enthusiasm</HD>
<DH>A dazzling array of new models from manufacturers is
generating lots of attention at auto shows, but it remains to be seen
if it will translate into good business for dealerships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's auto show time again, and the message this year, from Detroit,
Europe and Asia, is that there won't be a niche in the car market too
small to be served, nor a version of the basic truck too unimaginable
to be built.</LD>
<LD>   At the Los Angeles International Auto Show, which runs through
Sunday at the Convention Center, and the upcoming North American
International Auto Show in Detroit, there seems to be no
acknowledgment of a recession. There is every confidence that, if
they build it, customers will come.</LD>
<LD>   Whether they'll become buyers remains to be seen, but lookers
certainly came to the opening days of the L.A. show--organizers say
weekend attendance totaled 347,734 and represented a 20% increase
from last year's opening days.</LD>
<TE>   Detroit, although facing a new year already marred by auto
industry layoffs and expectations of falling sales, likewise is
expecting a heavy turnout.</TE>
<TE>   But auto makers are ever-hopeful, and to cater to the crowds this
year are offering a spate of new models aimed at young
street-performance enthusiasts; wealthy--and in most cases,
older--drivers seeking luxury in trucks as well as in cars; soccer
moms who don't want to be thought of that way when they arrive in
their new set of wheels; boaters, equestrians and construction bosses
who need cargo-carrying and load-towing power; and even
environmentalists who want the least-polluting vehicles the industry
will provide.</TE>
<TE>   About the only buyer group being ignored by most is the
budget-conscious penny-pinchers; few car companies will feature a
bottom-of-the-line model at an event aimed at whipping up new-car
lust.</TE>
<TE>   So from a $20,000 Dodge Neon subcompact with a turbocharged
4-cylinder engine and a 0-to-60 mph time of 5.9 seconds, to a
leather-lined, $78,000 Mercedes Benz G-Class sport-utility and
beyond, the auto industry is rolling out its best and hoping that
show-goers will leave afire with the need to hit the local new-car
dealership.</TE>
<TE>   This week, in part one of a two-part look at the first shows of
2002, Highway 1 offers a photo spread featuring some of the new
production models unveiled in Los  Angeles and Detroit--where the
doors open to the public Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Next week we'll provide a glimpse of some of those usually
fantastic, sometimes freaky and often futuristic concepts the auto
industry uses to gauge public acceptance of new themes and ideas.</TE>

<HD>Teen Driver Law Works Only if Parents Pay Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever young people are killed in vehicle accidents, the loss and
sense of despair is enormous.</LD>
<LD>   Multiply it a thousand times when those deaths occur as a result
of teen drivers breaking laws specifically designed to safeguard them
from their own inexperience.</LD>
<LD>   The recent accident that killed two Westlake teenagers and injured
two others in the early morning of Dec. 29, is an example of such
tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   When Kenneth Marshall Glass, 16, slid behind the wheel of his
family's Mercedes-Benz station wagon and took three friends on the
ride that ended in tragedy, he had only a provisional driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's 31/2-year-old graduated driver's license law,
Glass was prohibited from driving with passengers under the age of 20
unless accompanied by a licensed driver 25 or older. The provisional
license also was supposed to keep him from driving between the hours
of midnight and 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sheriff's deputies say Glass' parents were out of
town on a ski trip. A department spokeswoman said investigators do
not know whether the teen had his parents' permission to drive the
vehicle at night without an adult, or took the car without their
approval.</TE>
<TE>   What is apparent, according to Ventura County sheriff's deputies,
is that Glass violated both the driver's license law and speed law
when he took his friends out that night to get something to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary investigation indicates the car was moving at 106
mph when Glass lost control and slammed into a wall about 1 a.m. on
Westlake Boulevard near Hillcrest Drive, a stretch of road with a 45
mph speed limit.</TE>
<TE>   Glass and his good friend Jordan Bass, also 16, died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Two others in the vehicle, Joshua Kuai, 16, of Westlake Village,
and Jenae Chu, 16, of Thousand Oaks, survived the accident but were
hospitalized with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   All the car's occupants were wearing seat belts, and police say
there was no sign at the scene of alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   California has one of the strictest teen driving laws in the
country, but it works only when people obey it.</TE>
<TE>   Study after study have shown that the more teenage passengers in a
vehicle driven by a young and inexperienced driver, the greater the
risk of an accident.</TE>
<TE>   There's no excuse for parents or their teenagers to try to
circumvent the law. Sure, parents tire of chauffeuring their children
to music lessons, games or school events. Many of them can't wait for
their teens to have their own vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "But at what price is that convenience? Those are your children,"
says Candysse Miller of the Insurance Information Network of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have a great law on the books, but if it's not being
followed, it's not going to save their lives.... We've seen that the
worst accidents happen at night when there are teens alone in
vehicles," Miller says.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the statistics. Perhaps teens and their parents
should be required to memorize them.</TE>
<TE>   Car crashes are the leading cause of death among teenagers in the
United States, according to the national Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning drivers have the highest rates of teenage passenger
deaths in their vehicles, per licensed driver and miles driven, and
they have the highest percentage of crashes related to speeding,
according to Farmers Insurance Group.</TE>
<TE>   A study two years ago by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
found that by the time a 16- or 17-year-old driver has three
passengers of any age in the car, the chance of getting into a fatal
crash is three times higher than if there were no passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The risk is even higher for boys carrying teenage passengers,
according to the study reported in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the most recent statistics from the California
Highway Patrol show that drivers between the ages of 15 and 19 were
involved in 480 fatal accidents and 37,546 injury accidents in 2000.
That's up from 469 fatal teen accidents and 35,733 injury accidents
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there's not anywhere near full compliance" with the
tough teen licensing laws, says Dr. Alan Williams, spokesman for the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame? Do we need stricter enforcement of the regulations
under the provisional licenses? Miller says police in California
can't stop a teen driver with kids in the car just because he may
look as if he's driving with a provisional license. The driver must
be stopped for a primary offense such as speeding or reckless
driving.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper reports all described Kenneth Glass as a fine young man
with a promising future. But kids are kids, and even the nicest and
brightest of them can get silly and reckless, or buckle under to peer
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how many thrilling speed chases they see in movies, kids
need to know that slamming into a wall at 100 miles a hour is
anything but glamorous.</TE>
<TE>   As for parents, they have control of the keys to the car. They
also control whether a minor owns a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, if parents fear their teen is violating terms of a
provisional license or engaging in reckless driving, they can contact
the Department of Motor Vehicles and request that their child's
license be canceled.</TE>

<LD>When push comes to shove at my house and there's little around to
eat, eggs often save the day.</LD>
<LD>   This handy little helper has an unfortunate reputation, of course,
mostly due to the high cholesterol content of the yolk. But even
dieters don't turn up their noses at the white of an egg, because
it's a good source of protein and riboflavin.</LD>
<LD>   If you're trying to lose weight, this egg salad recipe cuts back
on yolks without any loss of flavor. It can be made with nothing but
egg whites, or with one yolk added for color.</LD>
<TE>   In defense of the yolk, while it contains all of the fat in an
egg, it's also a good source of protein, iron and vitamins A and D.
Remember that when you're eating a deviled egg--or just half a
deviled egg. It's a wonderful treat, well worth the splurge.</TE>

<HD>Faithful to the Core, Past and Present</HD>
<DH>Apples always brought delight, and once a new set of pots
and pans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONOKO SAKAI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many ways to eat an apple. My centenarian grandmother likes
to peel the skin first. Artfully, she guides the paring knife
clockwise from top to bottom and produces a red spiral peel so
beautiful you want to hang it from the ceiling like a mobile. As a
child, I would play with the curly peel and then eat it.</LD>
<LD>   My mother believes apples taste best when baked in pies. She uses
whatever pan she can find in the kitchen, sometimes using a large
cookie sheet to make a big rectangular pie that's enough to feed an
army.</LD>
<LD>   I have been trying to get her recipe, but it changes every time I
ask her. She relies on her eyes to measure the ingredients, and,
while they may be useful to sort out the good apples from the bad
ones, they are not accurate in the way a scale is. Still, I have yet
to eat a bad apple pie she has baked.</LD>
<TE>   When I was a girl, she always baked in the middle of the night,
when everyone was asleep. Cool temperatures and peace of mind were
high on her list of optimum conditions. But such peace was often
disrupted when the smell of pies baking in the hot oven would rise to
the bedrooms and stir the sleep of her five children. We would come
down to the kitchen in our pajamas and munch on the sliced apples as
my mother raced to peel more to replace them. If there was any
leftover dough, she would let us make roses and leaves to decorate
the tops of the pies.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, we would hang out in the kitchen long enough to get a
taste of the warm pie before we were sent upstairs. By dawn, the pies
would be sitting on the kitchen counter, wrapped in foil, ready to be
sent off with my father to work. My father never asked her for them,
but every fall and winter my mother made sweet treats for his office.</TE>
<TE>   I will never forget the applesauce that a pots and pans salesman
once made for us. My mother was a sucker for any door-to-door
salesmen who rang our doorbell. If it wasn't the Fuller Brush man,
who rang the bell and knocked persistently until my mother
surrendered, it was the Encyclopedia Britannica salesman or the Avon
Lady.</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day, the pots and pans salesman showed up at our
doorstep with his whole shop. His belly popped out and draped over
his belt, which was enough to make me suspicious, but, as always, my
mother quickly gave into the friendly sales pitch and invited the
stranger into the house.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, he worked his way into the kitchen where he wanted to
show us how to make applesauce. I wasn't sure I could trust him, but,
like a magician, he produced a half-dozen apples and a shiny, heavy
stainless steel pan out of his carrying bag and made himself at home.</TE>
<TE>   He prepared applesauce in two pans: one in the saucepan he was
trying to sell us, another in the dented aluminum pan that belonged
to my mother. To our surprise, the applesauce he made in his saucepan
tasted much sweeter and smoother than the one he made in my mother's
pan. He said that the tight lid, which sealed the pan and allowed the
apples to steam, did the trick.</TE>
<TE>   After the demonstration, my mother was convinced that a set of
these pots and pans would make a nice dowry for me. When the salesman
offered her an attractive layaway plan, a bonus gift of an electric
crepe maker and a full warranty, she lit up like a bright bulb. He
walked out of the house with the down payment on the whole set of
pots and pans and a big smile. I was only 17 years old and marriage
was the last thing on my mind, but there I was with pots and pans
that were promised to last me a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Recently I learned that my neighbor across the street has an apple
tree in her backyard. Some of the apples are big and green like a
Granny Smith; others are blushed like a McIntosh. She doesn't know
what kind of apple it produces, but she says the fruit is too tart to
be eaten raw. So most of them stay on the tree until they fall and
rot.</TE>
<TE>   When she showed me the tree, my neighbor seemed a bit embarrassed
by its imperfections and pulled me away to look instead at her
beautiful roses. When I told her I wanted to have some apples, she
thought I was out of my mind but handed me a shopping bag and invited
me to take as many apples as I wanted.</TE>
<TE>   As I brought home my bag full of irregular apples, a rusty
cast-iron pan--the one the former owner of our house left
behind--caught my eye. It was in the garage, waiting to be donated to
the Salvation Army, but I suddenly had a brilliant idea. I wanted to
make a tarte tatin.</TE>
<TE>   I scrubbed the pan until it was black and shiny again. With my
neighbor's neglected apples and the castoff pan, I produced a
wonderful tarte tatin on my first try. Since then, it has become my
favorite homemade dessert. The only time I failed was when I walked
away from the stove when the apples were caramelizing. I nearly
ruined the pan, but with a little more scrubbing it survived my
abuse, as cast-iron pans usually will.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, 30 years later that set of pots and pans the salesman
convinced my mother to buy is still holding up, more or less, here in
Los Angeles and across the Pacific in Tokyo, where my grandmother
treasures the bonus electric crepe maker, which she stores in its
original box and takes out when she finds an occasion to make apple
crepes.</TE>

<TE>   Applesauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   My Italian relative makes an applesauce with a variety of apples
that grow on her land. She says Golden Delicious makes the tastiest
applesauce. After experimenting with various apples, I agree. Golden
Delicious is low in pulp and makes a delicious smooth applesauce.
Some people, however, prefer applesauce with texture, in which case
you might try the pulpier Pink Lady or Roma apples.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   6 firm apples peeled, cored and sliced into 8 wedges</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons sugar, plus more if necessary</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup water</TE>
<TE>   Combine the apples, sugar and water in a saucepan. Cover and cook
over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes. Remove the lid and stir
from the bottom to prevent sticking. If the apples are sticking, add
1 or 2 more tablespoons of water. Cover the saucepan and continue
cooking until the apples start to fall apart, stirring once or twice
to prevent sticking, another 7 to 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat and mash the apples with a fork or potato
masher. Taste the sweetness of the applesauce. Add an additional
teaspoon or 2 of sugar as needed. Serve warm as a side dish or
chilled as a dessert with cream if you like.</TE>

<TE>   Akiko Kondo's Double-Crusted Apple Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours
plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   My mother likes the natural flavors of the apples and dislikes
cinnamon--the common flavoring for American apple pies. My sister,
the pastry chef, recommends vanilla to flavor the apples in a pie,
which I like. Simply split a piece of vanilla bean and scrape the
seeds into the sugar. Then add the flavored sugar to the apples. If
vanilla bean is not available, add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla
extract to the pan immediately after the apples turn transparent in
cooking. The filling is not thickened. Tart apples, especially
Pippin, do not produce much liquid during cooking, but if they do,
simply take the semi-cooked apples out of the pan and let the liquid
reduce to a syrup and then pour it back over the apples.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   APPLE FILLING</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   8 firm apples, preferably Pippin or Granny Smith, cored, peeled
and sliced into 8 wedges</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the
apples and stir gently to coat the apples evenly with the melted
butter. Sprinkle the apples with the sugar and cook until the apples
become semi-translucent, but still hold their shape, 10 to 12
minutes, stirring occasionally. If too much liquid remains in the
pan, remove the apples and continue cooking the liquid until it has
reduced to a syrup. Return the apples to the pan and let cool
completely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PIE CRUST</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups flour, sifted</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) butter, chilled, sliced into 8 pieces</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 tablespoons ice cold water</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Place the flour and salt in the middle of a flat surface. Make a
well in the flour mixture. Put the butter in the well. With a pastry
cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture. Scoop the loose flour
from the sides and quickly work it into the butter. Continue this
process until the mixture becomes large pea-size lumps. This should
take about a minute. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of chilled water over the
flour mixture. Using your fingertips, pat and press the dough
together into a ball. If the dough is still dry and loose, add an
additional tablespoon or two of chilled water. Continue patting and
pressing the dough until you can mold it into a disk, about 6 inches
in diameter. Divide the dough in half, form each half into a disk and
wrap with plastic. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Once the dough has chilled, lightly flour a flat surface and a
rolling pin. Take 1 disk of dough out of the refrigerator to make the
bottom crust. Beginning from the center of the disk, roll out the
dough to the edges to make a circle, slightly larger than a 9-inch
pie pan and about 1/8-inch thick. Roll only in one direction. Keep
rotating the circle as you roll, so it doesn't stick to the flat
surface. Fold the dough in half and transfer it to a 9-inch pie pan.
Unfold the circle and press it into the pan with your fingers and
allow the dough to hang over the pie pan. Chill the pan in the
refrigerator while you roll out the top dough.</TE>
<TE>   For the top dough, repeat the same rolling process.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Apple Filling</TE>
<TE>   Pie Crust</TE>
<TE>   1 egg yolk</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon milk</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pour the apple filling into the bottom crust, spreading evenly in
the pan. Roll the top dough around the rolling pin and then unroll it
over the filling, pressing the top and bottom crusts together to
seal. Use a wet fork to crimp the rim of the pie. Use the tines of a
fork to poke some holes in the top crust for ventilation.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg yolk and milk and brush over the top of the pie to
make a shiny glazed finish. Set the pie pan on a baking sheet and
bake until the top crust is golden, about 65 to 70 minutes. Let the
pie cool a little before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Optional decoration: To make a rose, , use 2 (2-inch square)
pieces of leftover dough. Slit a 1/2-inch cross in the middle of each
square. Take one square and place it on top of the other but slide it
to the left so the corners do not match. Gently tuck the corners
under to open the slit that you made in the middle of each square. As
the slits open, you will see the dough transform into a rose. Cut out
leaves with the remaining dough, making shallow slits for the veins
with a knife. Glaze with the egg yolk mixture and bake the pie.</TE>

<TE>   Upside-Down Apple Tart (Tarte Tatin)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 50
minutes plus 30 minutes chilling</TE>
<TE>   This is my favorite French apple dessert. You can make the apple
filling earlier in the day and roll out the pastry and bake the tart
in the evening if you wish. Serve this with plain whipped cream.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   8 or 9 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced into quarters</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast-iron or heavy skillet over
medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the sugar.
Stir until the butter is evenly mixed in.</TE>
<TE>   Working clockwise, tightly pack the apple wedges around the inside
edge of the skillet, laying them on their sides. The apples will
shrink as they cook, so don't hesitate to pack them tight. With the
remaining apples, arrange them on their sides in the center of the
skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the apples over high heat until the butter and sugar turn
brown and caramelize, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and
carefully turn the apples over to the uncooked side using 2 forks.
Make sure that the apples are browned before you turn them over. Pack
the apples tightly on their sides. If you see a loose area, rearrange
the apples a bit to fill in the gap. Return to high heat and cook for
another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the apples cool in the
skillet while you work on the dough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DOUGH</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups flour, sifted</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 10
pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, beaten</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sift together the flour, powdered sugar and salt onto a flat
surface. Make a well in the sifted ingredients for the butter. Using
a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it
resembles a lumpy coarse meal. Stir in the egg and quickly work it
into the flour mixture until it holds together. Pat and press the
dough into a disk. Wrap the dough with plastic and refrigerate for at
least 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Once the dough has chilled, lightly flour a flat surface and a
rolling pin. Roll out the dough into a circle slightly larger than
the skillet. Lay the dough over the apples and tuck the extra dough
between the apples and the side of the skillet. Trim off excess
dough.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the pastry is golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the tart
to cool in the skillet for 15 minutes. With a sharp knife, cut around
the edges. Carefully, turn the hot tart over onto a large serving
platter. Serve warm.</TE>

<HD>What Could Be Nicer Than Otto's Bread Slicer?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The greatest thing since sliced bread" has been a proverbial
expression for 70 years. By now it has a quaint, even faintly ironic
ring--was sliced bread really greater than computers, space travel
and pull-tab cans?--but when Otto Rohwedder introduced his
bread-slicing machine in 1928, people really were impressed. Within
five years, 80% of the bread in the country was being sold
pre-sliced.</LD>
<LD>   Today we seem to think this was because sliced bread was a
convenience, like frozen food. It certainly was convenient, but the
thing that really excited Americans about Rohwedder's machine was the
fact that it made more regular slices than the average person could
accomplish with a bread knife. In particular, it did a sterling job
on the sort of soft, puffy, almost cake-like white bread Americans
loved as a symbol of moving up from one's impoverished immigrant
heritage (in a later generation, of course, the upwardly mobile would
make a point of preferring dense, coarse peasant breads).</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't just an aesthetic matter, either. Machine-sliced bread
must have nipped in the bud many a potential tantrum about whether
one sibling was getting a larger slice than the others. Above all,
sliced bread made it possible to make perfectly even toast.</LD>
<TE>   As it happened, just a year before Rohwedder's invention, Charles
Strife had patented another device that was destined to conquer
America's kitchens: the electric pop-up toaster, which could
guarantee that your toast wouldn't burn, even if nobody was watching
it continuously. Here's the thing: On the toasting gadgets that had
existed up to that time, it had been possible to get by with sloppily
sliced bread, but the pop-up toaster might jam if you didn't feed it
perfectly regular slices. And that wasn't the kind of jam you wanted
with your toast.</TE>

<LD>At this time of year, I find I'm fed up with rich food--oatmeal
tastes great for breakfast, I crave vegetable juice, and I want to
add more soy to my diet.</LD>
<LD>   This quick breakfast drink is based on a vanilla-flavored,
milk-like beverage made from soybeans, filtered water and vanilla.
You'll find it in cartons in supermarkets, health food and specialty
stores. Soy milk is cholesterol-free, lactose-free and low in fat. It
can often be used in place of milk.</LD>

<LD>Among a few staples that I keep in the cupboard, just in case a
friend stays for supper, is a bag of lentils, one of the ingredients
I always turn to when I need a last-minute dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Lentils are an everyday staple from the Mediterranean to India.
There is a Hindu proverb, "Rice is good, but lentils are my life." As
far as we know, they are one of the oldest domesticated ingredients
on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Lentils don't need to be soaked. When cooking them, use 2 cups of
water to every cup of lentils. Bring the lentils and water to a boil
and cover. Turn the heat to medium, and check for doneness in 20
minutes by tasting the lentils for tenderness. If they're still firm,
cook another 10 minutes and taste again. They usually don't take
longer than 30 minutes. Cooked cold lentils are good in salads and
soups.</LD>
<TE>   Be sure to read the cooking directions on the sausage you buy. If
you are using raw pork sausages they need to be cooked thoroughly
before adding them to the lentils. Most other sausages are precooked
and need to be heated thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lentils With Sausages</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 5 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2 onions</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   2 baking potatoes</TE>
<TE>   3 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups dried lentils</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound sausage, such as kielbasa, chorizo, Italian or linguica,
cut into 1/2-inch slices</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cut the onions in half from the stem top to the root bottom. Lay
each half cut side down on a chopping board. Slice each half
horizontally into 1/4-inch slices. Then cut down vertically into thin
slices, and finish by cutting down crosswise so you have many small
pieces of onion. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the garlic into thin slices lengthwise. Turn the slices on
their side and cut into lengthwise thin slices. Holding the slices
together, cut into small pieces vertically. Set aside with the onion.</TE>
<TE>   Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Add them to the
onions and garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Place the water and lentils into a pot. Add the onions, garlic,
potatoes, sausage and salt and pepper to taste. Tear the bay leaf
into several pieces and add to the pot. Bring to a simmer over medium
heat. Cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the lid and poke a piece of potato; if tender, fish out a
little of the lentils and taste for tenderness. If both the potatoes
and lentils are tender, they are ready to serve. If either is still
firm, simmer another 10 minutes. Most of the liquid will have been
absorbed. Serve in bowls.</TE>

<LD>A side dish, a sauce and chicken all in one? Yes, a roulade. A
roulade is a piece of poultry, meat or fish wrapped around a
stuffing. Pound the chicken thinly, add other ingredients, then wrap
it up and cook.</LD>
<LD>   The stuffing eliminates the need for a sauce. Each bite of chicken
includes the sweetness of the sun-dried tomato pesto, the wilted
spinach and creamy melted goat cheese. If you are feeling creative,
change the flavor of your roulades by using basil pesto and
experimenting with some of your favorite cheeses.</LD>
<LD>   A roulade makes a beautiful presentation. Slice it in half on a
bias or in a few rounds and serve over rice pilaf.</LD>
<TE>   Since the roulades take 15 to 20 minutes to roast, be sure to have
all your ingredients ready before you start rolling.</TE>

<TE>   Roasted Chicken Roulade With Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach and Goat
Cheese</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1 1/4 pounds</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sun-dried tomato pesto or tapenade</TE>
<TE>   12 large spinach leaves, stemmed</TE>
<TE>   8 teaspoons (2 ounces) goat cheese</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a jellyroll pan with
parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   Two at a time, place the chicken breasts, smooth side up, between
2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, gently and evenly
pound the chicken to about 1/4-inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   Place each pounded chicken breast lengthwise on the
parchment-covered pan, smooth side down. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread the pesto over the surface of the chicken, dividing evenly.
Press 3 spinach leaves on top of each breast and add 2 teaspoons of
goat cheese. Very gently and tightly, roll the chicken away from you.
Rub the top of each roulade with olive oil and season with salt and
pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Roast the roulades until the internal temperature reaches 165
degrees, about 20 minutes. At the 18-minute mark, cut one of the
roulades in half to check if the chicken is cooked through; if not,
return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>

ripens late and has a pretty good level of color but not a lot of
tannin. This wine has a nice richness on the palate. It's a very
user-friendly wine, an amiable kind of wine, but that doesn't mean
it's wimpy."</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Many years ago The Times published a recipe for a beef
kebab marinade that was the best ever. I was newly married and used
it for my first dinner party. It had oil, lemon juice, garlic, soy
sauce (I think), maybe parsley, pepper and I don't know what else.</LD>

<LD>The two women were discussing mushrooms in the produce department at
a Chinese market. "Add a little soy sauce and some onion," said one.
"Put in ginger root, of course, and be sure to include a dash of
sugar." I couldn't wait to try it myself.</LD>
<LD>   We learn new dishes in any number of ways--from cookbooks,
friends, publications, TV shows and restaurants. And sometimes even
by eavesdropping.</LD>
<LD>   I came across an idea for spinach seasoned with lots of garlic in
a Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown. The greens were drenched with a
clear sauce that contained an impressive amount of chopped garlic. I
could taste no soy sauce, or maybe just a little of the light kind
that adds saltiness rather than color. And I detected the slight
perfume of toasted sesame oil.</LD>
<TE>   As with the mushrooms, after a little experimenting I had come up
with an easy dish that takes almost no time to prepare, once you've
washed and trimmed the spinach.</TE>
<TE>   Some people dislike broccoli, but they've probably never
encountered sweet Thai-style broccoli, which appeared as a garnish on
a platter at a Thai restaurant in West Los Angeles. When I was
curious, a Thai friend explained how to make it. It's better than
candy, in my opinion--the bright green vegetable topped with crunchy,
golden fried garlic and lightly seasoned with a mixture of fish sauce
and sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Braised red cabbage sounds so European--until you taste it cooked
Bengali style with an Indian spice called kala jeera (black cumin).
Debashish Banerji, director of the Sri Aurobindo Center in Culver
City, combines the cabbage with potatoes, ginger and fresh basil.
It's a fusion dish based on a recipe from his native Calcutta. Black
cumin, which tastes nothing like ordinary cumin, is available in
Indian shops here.</TE>
<TE>   Banerji also adds black mustard seeds, and he cooks the cabbage
lightly so that it remains slightly crunchy. That's a radical switch
from the Indian preference for vegetables cooked until soft.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes ideas come from nowhere, like a lightbulb of inspiration
popping in one's brain. This is how I came up with a variation on
classic Scandinavian red cabbage. Apple is often added, and it
occurred to me to put in dried cranberries too. Balsamic vinegar fits
the sweet-sour concept of the dish, so a few drops of that, along
with wine and currant jelly, seemed appropriate. The result was red
cabbage with a twist, but still acceptably traditional.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, I was examining a head of broccoflower in the
market when a hefty cauliflower tumbled from the rack above and hit
me. I'll get even by putting it into soup, I decided. Or maybe into
the Indian potato-cauliflower dish called aloo gobi, although
green-gold broccoflower might look more interesting in that
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Now you see how easy it is to come up with new ideas. Keep your
eyes open when you're eating out, listen hard when you're at the
grocery and always be ready for inspiration, or a cauliflower, to
strike.</TE>

<TE>   Debashish Banerji's Potatoes With Cabbage</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes
* Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Black cumin seeds and black mustard seeds are available at Indian
markets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds red cabbage</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon black cumin seeds (kala jeera)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped ginger root</TE>
<TE>   6 basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   12 baby red potatoes (about 1 pound), unpeeled, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup cilantro leaves, packed</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remove the outer cabbage leaves. Quarter the cabbage, if whole,
and remove the core. Slice the cabbage crosswise into 1/2-inch
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the black
cumin and mustard seeds and cook until the mustard seeds pop, 1
minute. Add the ginger, then the basil leaves and cook a minute or
so. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring to mix with the spices, about
3 minutes. Add the cabbage and salt. Mix well, cover and cook over
medium-high heat until the potatoes are tender and the cabbage is
wilted but still slightly crunchy, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Taste and add more salt if needed. Turn out and top with cilantro
leaves.</TE>

<TE>   Wilted Garlic Spinach</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Serve this, if desired, over cooked rice. You'll find light soy
sauce--which refers to its color, not its sodium content-- at Asian

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch spinach (about 3/4 pound)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon light soy sauce</TE>

<TE>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped garlic</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remove the coarse stems from the spinach, then wash the spinach
well to remove all grit and drain thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the chicken broth, soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch and sesame
oil in a small bowl. If the broth is not salty, add salt to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the
garlic and cook about 1 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly. Do not
allow the garlic to turn brown.</TE>
<TE>   Stir up the broth mixture so the cornstarch is evenly blended and
add to the wok. Cook 30 seconds, until thickened.</TE>
<TE>   Increase the heat, add the spinach and cook and stir until just
barely wilted and coated with the seasonings. The spinach should not
be overly soft and limp. This will take about 2 minutes depending
upon the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Turn out the spinach into a heated shallow bowl to collect the
juices. To serve, drain the spinach from the juices, or serve with
juice over rice.</TE>

<HD>J. Rochioli Creates Its Own Miniature Cote d'Or</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every once in a while, new wines show us how the global wine culture
continues to evolve. Last year's release of five notable wines from a
single Northern California property was a significant event in the
small but vibrant world of California Pinot Noir: the adoption not so
much of a French grape or winemaking technique but of a way of
thinking about wine.</LD>
<LD>   The wines were vineyard-designated 1999 Pinots from J. Rochioli
Vineyards. The West Block, East Block, Little Hill, River Block and
Three Corner Vineyard are from adjoining plots at the heart of the
Rochioli estate, a miniature Cote d'Or on the northern edge of the
Russian River. Such a detailed anatomical representation of a wine
estate is unprecedented in California, even in the precocious Russian
River Valley Pinot culture.</LD>
<LD>   In their Californian way, these five Rochioli wines represent a
mosaic of distinctive expressions comparable to wines from a similar
cluster of vineyards in, say, Vosne-Romanee. They aren't Burgundy,
and they certainly aren't Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. What they are
is California's first convincing emulation of the classical model,
and as such they signal an exciting new phase in Russian River Valley
Pinot Noir evolution.</LD>
<TE>   Without question, Burgundy still rules Pinot Noir with its
tapestry of tiny, closely segregated vineyards. It probably always
will. Certainly in the foreseeable future it will remain light years
ahead of other aspiring Pinot regions in its high degree of
viticultural definition, the depth and complexity of its wine culture
and the high accomplishments of its vignerons.</TE>
<TE>   But it took thousands of years for Pinot Noir to emerge as the
primary red grape of Burgundy, and many centuries for a culture to
coalesce around it. In the Russian River Valley, an echo of that
process has taken barely half a century.</TE>
<TE>   In the Rochioli vineyards, the plant material and cultivation are
essentially the same throughout the five blocks, which include grower
Joe Rochioli's original 1968 vines, propagated from a selection that
he obtained from the old Karl Wente vineyard in Livermore. That block
was the source of budwood for most subsequent plantings on the ranch,
although newer (non-designated) blocks also include two Dijon clones
as well as the Swan and Hanzell selections.</TE>
<TE>   And each wine is made in the same straightforward way (open-top
fermenters, mixed French oak barrels) by Tom Rochioli (Joe's son and
partner). Tom's intent is to shepherd the wines through the process
without manipulation; he says the most crucial decision he makes is
when to pick each block.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite everything they have in common, each wine is
different, evidently reflecting mysterious variations in terroir that
are comparable to the subtle shifts in subsoil and aspect that define
the great Cote d'Or vineyards. Although it's not yet apparent just
what the determining factors are in this situation, Pinot fans have
an exciting opportunity to taste along with Tom Rochioli as the story
unfolds vintage by vintage.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main qualities the wines share is a remarkable clarity
of fruit. That's expressed most dramatically in the East Block, from
four acres of vines planted in 1968. This is a rich, deeply flavored
wine with succulent acidity that keeps it crystal-clear despite its
density, and provides a lift to the savory black-cherry finish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That balance of concentration and clarity also characterizes the
West Block, from four acres of the old Wente selection planted in
1969. This majestic Pinot Noir could serve as a liquid portrait of
the Russian River Valley, deep and full with a satisfying weight and
underlying current moving purposefully through the palate. That
harmony is also the hallmark of the intense, velvety wine from
neighboring River Block, 13 acres propagated from West Block vines
planted in 1995 on an especially deep gravel layer.</TE>
<TE>   There's more spice and elegance in the wine from Three Corner
Vineyard, a 1974 planting bordering West Block. "I think of it as the
feminine side of West Block," says Tom Rochioli. Indeed, it shows the
same generous perfume and deep flavor, but with a little less weight.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another facet of the estate is displayed in the finely
structured Pinot from the Little Hill vineyard, a scant two acres
planted in 1985 on thin soil over an ancient river rock deposit. In
its definition, high-toned perfume and racy momentum through the
palate, it is distinctly more Burgundian than the richer wines from
the adjacent Three Corner Vineyard and West Block.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, it was during a 1990 visit to Burgundy that
Tom Rochioli experienced his wine epiphany. It came, as it has for
many others, in the cellars of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, while
tasting with the reigning high priest of Pinot Noir, Aubert de
Villaine. Specifically, it was in the gleaming depths of the 1945 La
Tache that Rochioli saw the future.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, I was ready to join the church," he recalls.
"Suddenly it all made sense. Here are these blocks of vines together
in a pretty small area on a slope that looks fairly uniform, and the
wine from each block is different and unique."</TE>
<TE>   The vision in Burgundy galvanized a process that was already
underway. Tom had already bottled a separate 1989 Rochioli Reserve
Pinot that was entirely from West Block (already the source of
Williams-Selyem's "Rochioli Vineyard" bottling). That wine was the
first step toward segregating the best parts of the vineyard and
bottling single-vineyard wines (which now also include the '99 South
River Vineyard Chardonnay).</TE>
<TE>   He had been tracking the distinctive characteristics of wines from
the surrounding vineyards since joining the family business as
winemaker in 1982. Throughout the '90s he continued to refine his
sensory map of the estate. In '92 he added East Block and Three
Corner Vineyard to the reserve program, and Little Hill vineyard in
'95. At the same time, he had to balance the inclination toward
single-block bottlings with maintaining the integrity of the primary
Rochioli Estate Pinot Noir. "I didn't want to sacrifice the estate
wine for the single vineyard bottlings," he says now, "so I had to
wait for some of the newer vineyards to mature."</TE>
<TE>   The significant block-designated J. Rochioli '99s soon will be
joined by similar statements from a new planting on adjacent
property. The Rochiolis' new Sweetwater Vineyard was planted with
site-specific bottlings in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too young to tell yet," says Tom, "but I did a lot of
homework and I'm hoping for the best. Of course, this whole thing has
a lot to do with Mother Nature and luck."</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2000 Marquis Philips "Sarah's Blend," Southeastern
Australia</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's that critter on the label? It's the Roogle, half kangaroo,
half eagle, said to represent "the lasting friendship and the shared
destiny that link our two countries," Australia and America. Marquis
Philips is the joint project of Australian winemakers Sarah and
Sparky Marquis (Fox Creek and Henry's Drive) and Oxnard wine importer
Dan Philips.</LD>
<LD>   Their idea is to make small-batch, artisanal wines from purchased
grapes, and if their first bottlings are any indication, Marquis
Philips is on a roll. This one is a lot of wine for $13. The luscious
fruit of Shiraz (Syrah), cut velvet of Merlot and raspy grip of
Cabernet weave together into a deliciously ripe red. Also look for
the Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from the same label.</LD>

<LD>The student pilot who stole his flight school's plane and crashed it
into a Tampa, Fla., skyscraper Saturday evoked not one but two
national nightmares. Before emulating their depraved act, 15-year-old
Charles J. Bishop wrote a suicide note extolling the hijackers who
brought down the World Trade Center. But he probably had more in
common with the troubled adolescents who in recent years have acted
out their alienation by shooting classmates or teachers and, in at
least one case, themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Miraculously, only Bishop was killed in the crash. Damage was
largely confined to an unoccupied 28th-floor law office.</LD>
<LD>   Private pilots have been quick to distinguish the troubled
teenager from terrorists. What happened in Tampa, said a spokesman
for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn., was simply a breach of
trust between student and instructor when Bishop took off without his
teacher. Private aviation, the group argues, doesn't need the level
of security imposed on commercial airlines and airports after Sept.
11. After all, the stolen plane was only about the size of a sedan
and lacked the fuel capacity to pose the same threat as hijacked
jetliners.</LD>
<TE>   All this is true--to a point. But if a suicidal teenager can
hijack a small airplane and fly it into a high-rise, so could a
terrorist. And even a plane the size of a sedan could carry
explosives--or crash into a commercial jetliner. That this one did
not was probably due to the quick reflexes of a Southwest Airlines
pilot who dodged the single-engine Cessna as it took off from St.
Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   No measure can protect the public from every risk. It would be
impractical and probably impossible to subject the nation's 200,000
private planes and 500,000 pilots to the same degree of security as
commercial aircraft. But even the pilots association, when it is not
busy protecting its members' independence, knows that security can
and should be improved. Even before Tampa, it called for government
review of existing licenses and for the issuing of new,
difficult-to-counterfeit pilot licenses with a photo ID. It
recommended steps that owners can take to prevent airplane theft and
to verify the identity of passengers. These are good if belated
precautions.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are right to try to reconstruct the past of a
teenager described as both an honors student and a loner, but they
should do so with full knowledge that the next danger will no doubt
come from a different and perhaps more professional corner.</TE>

<LD>Forget about making online reservations for that camping trip to
Yosemite. And don't even think about researching whether any
companies have issued new proposals for mining or oil or gas drilling
on public lands.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors to most Internet sites run by the Interior Department get
only a message saying that access has been shut down since Dec. 5,
when a federal judge ordered the department to close Internet
security holes that allowed entry to the accounts of land assets held
by American Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   The department's response, shutting down sites including the
National Park Service's camping reservation system, seems like an
overreaction. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth had specifically
ordered that the department disconnect from the Internet ''all
information technology systems that house or provide access to
individual Indian trust data'' after an investigator working for
Lamberth managed to hack the land trust database and its royalty
funds. Cyber-security experts say the department should have been
able to separate and protect the computer server containing the land
royalty information without having to close down the Web sites;  the
department says it acted from an abundance of caution.</LD>
<TE>   In some ways the shutdowns are merely an inconvenience, because a
lot of Interior Department information is available offline.
Department officials point out, for example, that campsites can still
be reserved the old-fashioned way, by calling (800) 365-2267. But it
also brings up more serious issues.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Congress ordered the Government Printing Office,
which required government agencies to distribute all of their
publicly significant documents to 1,300 federal depository libraries,
to replace its ink-and- paper products with electronic records. In
the past, federal agencies could censor documents by deciding not to
send them to the depository libraries or by going to the trouble of
recalling them. Librarians say the Internet allows much greater
censorship powers--for example, to unobtrusively delete any
embarrassing parts of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Jacobs, a librarian at UC San Diego, relates an example:
''Consider what happened with the volume 'Foreign Relations of the
United States 1964-68.' After that book was published and
distributed, the State Department wished to withdraw it from
depository libraries because of the way it detailed the U.S. role in
Indonesia's deadly purge of Communists in the 1960s. It withdrew its
recall order after public outcry. Imagine what would have happened if
all the State Department had to do was erase a single file off a
single government computer."</TE>
<TE>   Congress can keep a watchdog on duty by restoring funding in the
2003 budget for the National Commission on Library and Information
Science, which is due to be eliminated. Without it, there will be no
one in Washington to ensure full public access to government
documents.</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason to think that censorship is involved in the
Interior Department shutdowns on the Internet. But it illustrates how
much the public depends on government Web sites, and why it needs
expert help in overseeing how they operate.</TE>

<LD>As he gears up for the gubernatorial race, Gov. Gray Davis is trying
to make sure he protects the political base he naturally has as a
Democrat and also to ensure that no Republican gets to the right of
him on crime issues. Thus Tuesday evening he embraced anti-terrorism
proposals including a dubious expansion of state wiretapping laws.
But he offered no details and did not present a compelling case for
the need to make it easier for police to eavesdrop. The Legislature
should ask a lot of tough questions before advancing any such
measure.</LD>
<LD>   The wiretap plan came in Davis' annual State of the State address
to a joint session of the Legislature. The opening minutes focused on
"the unspeakable attacks of Sept. 11" and the state's response, which
he claimed led those of all other states. And Davis introduced from
the audience a variety of individuals related to the Sept. 11 events,
among them California family members of passengers on the planes
involved, plus the family of Army Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser,
killed in action in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Call this the unofficial launching of Davis' campaign for
reelection, which will be wrapped generously in red, white and blue.
To his credit, Davis promised to protect education "above everything
else" in the budget but seemed to offer the same protection also to
law enforcement. He pledged to seek $75 million to expand before- and
after-school programs and work to make unemployment benefits
retroactive to Sept. 11. Also important, he promised to help
hospitals expand the number of nurses. These are commendable but
costly moves. Davis, in his budget proposal Thursday, should say
clearly how he would pay for all of this without trickery or pushing
costs into the future.</TE>
<TE>   California should be wary of Davis' call for sweeping new state
wiretapping rules, including the examination of e-mail. Congress
already has given federal authorities such power, including the
"roving" wiretap that allows eavesdropping on suspected terrorists on
whichever phone line or cell phone they may be using. Present state
law allows law enforcement to contact a judge, by telephone if
necessary, to ask for expansion of a wiretap warrant to additional
phones. Officers claim this is overly burdensome, but the state
should not make it convenient for local police to eavesdrop without
extraordinary cause.</TE>
<TE>   There was a little something for everyone in Davis' speech
Tuesday. Except, notably, any use of the word "recession."</TE>

<LD>Re "Islamic World's Hatred Dwarfs Its Admiration for America," Jan.
6: Washington must do two things to defuse Muslim distrust and
hatred: First, gain United Nations and world support for pressure on
Israel to solve its problems, short of enslaving the entire
Palestinian population. The settler communities must be turned over
to the Palestinians and resettled with the Palestinian refugees. The
U.S. and U.N. should provide for resettlement of the displaced
Israelis in their proper place--Israel.</LD>
<LD>   A Palestine state must be established that would include all
prewar territory. Jerusalem must be a protectorate of the U.N. It's
assumed that Yasser Arafat was given 90% of his demands at Camp David
and turned down the offer. The excluded 10% happened to include the
only two really important issues.</LD>
<LD>   Second, fulfill our obligation to bring a Marshall Plan to
Afghanistan. We have a golden opportunity here to convince the Muslim
world that we do indeed have a genuine interest in world peace, as
opposed to mere self-interest.</LD>

<LD>Your two-part series on refugees trying to enter Australia, by
Richard Paddock, was excellent for its detail and bringing to the
attention of the rest of the world our appalling treatment of these
people (Jan. 4-5). Australians pride themselves on their tolerance,
easygoing nature and giving everyone what they call a "fair go."
Unfortunately it is all a myth. Aussies are just as racist as any
other nationality but have difficulty accepting it.</LD>
<LD>   Our federal election last November was race-based, where both the
major political parties tried to outdo each other by being tough on
refugees trying to get to Australia. At present there are
approximately 50,000 people who have overstayed their tourist visas,
but no attempt is made to have them rounded up and put in detention
centers because they are mostly Americans and Western Europeans and
not Muslims fleeing from murderous, tyrannical regimes.</LD>

<TE>   Re "The 'Crime' of Being a Young Refugee," Jan. 5: The Australian
government not only has a right but has a responsibility to control
immigration. Just because Washington allows illegal immigration and
there are now 8 million or more illegal immigrants in the U.S. as a
result of cheap-labor lobbies and their campaign donations, this does
not mean Australia should follow our unsustainable policies.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the people who claim asylum in Australia pass through
several safe countries and don't make any attempt to claim asylum in
any of these countries, which means they are not seeking asylum but
economic opportunity. While they have every right to seek a better
life, they don't have a right to demand that a country give them
residency. Australia is one of the most generous countries in the
world in regard to immigrants and refugees.</TE>

<TE>   As a human rights lawyer specializing in refugee cases, I have
witnessed Australia's disgraceful treatment of asylum seekers
firsthand, and I can assure readers that Paddock's description of the
conditions in Australia's detention centers was entirely fair and
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. citizens contemplating a visit to Australia should think
carefully before supporting a country that so deliberately and
cruelly mistreats vulnerable people, including children.</TE>

<TE>   Point of interest: Perhaps if you had been a lot more careful
about who got into your country, things may have been considerably
different last September.</TE>
<TE>   With regard to our history of conquest over the indigenous tribes,
do I not smell a bit of hypocrisy in that statement? Was the United
States born from a giant land grant from the Indian tribes?</TE>

<HD>Copia Art Exhibit Brings Insult to Many</HD>

<LD>Re "Catholics Slam Napa Art Exhibit," Jan. 5: The protest over the
exhibit at Copia is surprising, considering that the use of
scatological imagery can be traced back to late 11th and early 12th
century Gothic manuscripts, where marginal illustrations decorated
the edges of psalters and books of hours. Members of the clergy
performing earthly acts were used with humorous--and sometimes
satirical--meanings, depending on the context, to entertain the
readers. Copia should be applauded for embracing artistic expression,
and the groups complaining should focus on more pressing issues, such
as overpopulation.</LD>

<TE>   Where is the liberal outrage? The Copia "art" exhibit is so
clearly hate speech of the most egregious sort, directed at
Catholicism, the religion practiced by the vast majority of Hispanics
in America and a whole lot of other people too, including blacks and
women. Could it be that when it comes to religion, there is a double
standard for liberals?</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that they, like the extreme leftists whose ideas
modern-day liberalism is based upon, believe that all religion is
evil and those who practice it deluded or stupid? I suggest that
liberals don't give a damn about hate speech, especially when they
can use it to muzzle or attack and intimidate those whose ideas
contradict theirs.</TE>

perfectly acceptable to depict themes that are anti-Catholic?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Girls Convicted as Adults Serve Time in Solitary," Jan. 3: I am a
17-year-old girl, and as I read this story about Noemi I couldn't
help but be shocked at the thought that the jail system doesn't know
the difference between an adult and a teenager. I don't try to
justify Noemi's actions; however, I agree with Javier Stauring,
director of the juvenile detention ministry of the Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, when he says, "It's a dungeon."</LD>
<LD>   Isolation, as I have heard, is only given to those people who have
committed extremely serious crimes or who get out of hand while in
prison. The fact that she is being isolated in the adult level simply
proves the jail system's failure to think in terms of the future. One
day Noemi will leave the prison and come out to the world--to
us--with all the things that she learned while imprisoned. Either she
was truly "disciplined" and will behave appropriately or she will put
into practice all the knowledge she gained from her sentence.</LD>

<LD>I was lucky to have worked for Peter Hemmings at the Los Angeles
Opera, where he was founding general director (obituary, Jan. 4). His
brilliance, artistic taste, creativity and deep love of opera were
equaled by his kindness and dedication to his staff and to the
community of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   His commitment to children led to the Los Angeles Opera becoming
an international leader in opera education. I shall never forget the
vision of this elegant and aristocratic gentleman attending operas
about teenage immigrants or inner-city cricket teams performed by his
beloved resident artists and schoolchildren at Manual Arts High
School, or watching him squeeze into pint-sized auditorium seats at
168th Street Elementary. He believed wholeheartedly that opera is for
everyone, and his daring and democratic vision helped opera finally
succeed in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   We all missed him after he and his wife retired and moved back to
England; the void his death leaves cannot ever be filled.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I keep hearing the refrain: The U.S. is backing away from its promise
to make airline travel safe.</LD>
<LD>   The evidence? High school. The government has changed its mind.
Instead of having to show a high school diploma, the people who are
employed at passenger checkpoints are going to be given credit for
work experience.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Rich of the New York Times, for one, fumed: "Now we're asked
to believe that high school dropouts are our best front-line of
defense against the cunning likes of Mohamed Atta, the recipient of
two university degrees."</LD>
<TE>   Quick, everybody, write Congress. Demand your "rights" to be
screened by a high school graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, blame rolls downhill. Who's at fault for Sept. 11?
Well, we've got to look beyond the airlines, which fought security
upgrades tooth and nail. Beyond the government, which ignored its own
warnings about the porous system. Beyond the low-bid contractors,
whose orders were to keep the lines moving. Beyond ourselves, always
in a hurry and looking for the cheapest fare.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, the real villains, it appears, were the people who wear
those ill-fitting company blazers at the checkpoints. The ones who
didn't have high school diplomas. They let the box cutters slip
through because, well, you know. They were dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   About one-quarter of our young people drop out of high school,
according to the National Center for Education. Almost half of
Latinos do and 40% of African Americans. Are they all incompetents?
All incapable of responsibility? Are they all stone stupid? And what
about our immigrants, those people with the gumption to get here but
maybe not the pedigree that it took to get into high school back
home?</TE>
<TE>   Those who would deny people credit for work experience imagine the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   What if you imagined otherwise? What if you imagined a woman who
married young, had two children and then was abandoned by her
husband. Maybe she was a B student who quit high school to care for
the first baby.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she struggled at temp jobs for a couple of years, then got
hired on as airport security. She was taught how to recognize the
shapes of dangerous items on the screening machine. She learned how
to "wand" people at the secondary check.</TE>
<TE>   At first, she was a problem employee. She studied the screen too
carefully. You probably remember her because the line moved slowly
whenever she was on. Hurry up, her supervisor warned her. Faster.
Quit asking to have so many bags hand-searched. Keep things moving.
Hurry.</TE>
<TE>   People in line grew impatient and were heard to whisper, "Who is
this moron?"</TE>
<TE>   Box-cutting knives were not in the training manual's profile. She
had seen travel alarm clocks that were the same shape as box cutters
on the X-ray image and fancy pencil holders too. But she did find a
five-inch pocketknife in the carry-on of one passenger. Nobody told
her, "Good work." Just to keep hurrying. So she did.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's another screener somewhere who knows a thing or two
about the gritty side of life. Perhaps this screener raised questions
about those big cowboy belt buckles. Have you ever seen what horrible
damage they can do in a bar fight when you wrap leather around your
hand and start swinging the buckle? Ah, but this screener didn't have
a diploma so the supervisor said, "Mind your own business."</TE>
<TE>   Different parents, different luck, some dropouts would have gone
on to college. Now, if they have proved that they can work, why not
let them?</TE>
<TE>   We can't trust these people? Then how come we give them driver's
licenses? That last cabby who took you down the freeway at 75 mph,
did he have a high school diploma? And how about all those 18-wheel
trucks out there, shoulder to shoulder at breakneck speed. We live or
die each day on the collective judgment, concentration and diligence
of these men and women behind the wheel--not on whether they got
bored with algebra or fed up with abusive parents and left home early
to get a job.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, a diploma is one measure of a person, and an important one.
But isn't an employment record another?</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Edison never even started high school. Dave Thomas, the
celebrated Wendy's hamburger entrepreneur who died Tuesday, never
finished.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, neither did the Eastern European immigrant who
rebuilt the brakes on my car. I trusted my life to him, and your life
too if you shared the road with me.</TE>

<LD>Re "Use Profiling Judiciously," Commentary, Jan. 4: In one fell
swoop, Jonathan Turley has convicted every American who happens to be
Muslim and/or Arab with a crime. Apparently, Turley justifies ethnic
profiling because there is one "single defined crime" that any person
of Muslim or Arab descent could have been involved in. I distinctly
remember another "single defined crime" in which Anglo Americans were
never profiled. Timothy McVeigh certainly did not represent all Anglo
Americans. As such, civil liberties violations and the ensuing
humiliation and outright harassment now being experienced by members
of the American Muslim and Arab community were never visited upon our
Anglo American brethren.</LD>
<LD>   I don't suggest that we not be alert and vigilant in preventing
any future terrorist attacks. However, using "intelligent" profiling,
in which there is reason to take someone off a plane, for example,
will serve America the best.</LD>

<LD>Niko and Theo Milonopoulos, who wrote the Jan. 5 Voices piece
regarding the banning of ammunition in Los Angeles, cite Chicago and
Washington as cities that have already banned the sale of ammunition
as well as guns. These two cities are classic examples of the
ineffectiveness of these bans, since Washington has the highest per
capita murder rate in the U.S. and Chicago is not far behind.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Adoption Agenda Needs Greater Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While I realize John Balzar's main point is to criticize the INS, he
is using the flaws of that institution to justify ignoring the flaws
of another institution--those of the Cambodian legal system ("The
U.S. Adoption Snake Pit," Commentary, Jan. 6). If ever there were a
snake pit, that's it, and for Balzar to evade the cold, hard truth
that a child adopted from Cambodia may have himself or herself been
"wheeled and dealed" is simply to deny the reality of modern
Cambodia.</LD>
<LD>   For someone concerned about the welfare of children in the
adoption system, I would have thought Balzar would want to be more
vigilant about how the children came to be in the system in the first
place. Apparently, that is not the case. And while I am sympathetic
to the frustrations of those trying to adopt in the U.S.,
perpetuating the theft of, and fraud and brutality on, Cambodian
children is hardly the answer.</LD>
<LD>   Sophie Richardson</LD>
<TE>   Charlottesville, Va.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his haste to import children for adoption, what Balzar misses
is that INS Commissioner James Ziglar is concerned about
baby-stealing and brokering. This concern is quickly glossed over by
Balzar's desire to fill the demand by U.S. adopters for children.</TE>
<TE>   After I reunited with my natural family, I began to research the
$1.4-billion U.S. adoption industry. I have interviewed many U.S.
mothers who have lost their children to adoption, and I have yet to
meet a mother who does not regret her decision. When I read about a
foreign adoption, I know that there is a family, usually an
impoverished one, who has also lost a member. Balzar evidently
believes that adoptable children are abandoned by parents who
couldn't care less about their children. Most parents, foreign or
domestic, care about their children and want to raise them.</TE>
<TE>   Balzar's rush to import children for adoption caters more to those
who adopt than to the natural parents or children. One source
estimated that there are well over 100 potential adopters competing
for each infant. The demand is much higher than the supply. What
concerns me, however, is the children, who will lose not only their
natural families but also their culture. If Balzar and other adopters
cared about the children, they would use the $30,000 to $40,000 per
adoption to help the children stay in their country with family
members.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Can Defuse the Kashmir Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Shock therapy now seems the required antidote to resolve South Asia's
nuclear brinkmanship. Last weekend's choreographed handshake in
Katmandu between Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee--and the rhetoric that followed
it--demonstrated again how domestic political considerations for each
are wreaking havoc on the security of 1.2 billion people.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent crisis, sparked by a Dec. 13 terrorist attack on
India's Parliament, which killed 14, has escalated into a dangerous
game of chicken in the Himalayan peaks of Kashmir. The confrontation
is fueled by Pakistan's religious zealots, who seek to create an
Islamic utopia there, and by India's Hindu nationalists, who seek to
control Kashmir's Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   These unrealistic dreams are manifested today by Pakistani
military brigades moving from the Afghan border to fortify against
massing Indian troops to the east--thus compromising the U.S. war on
terror--and light artillery fire across the Line of Control that
divides Kashmir. Only one shot need go awry to spark full-scale war;
both sides have begun assembly of nuclear warheads.</LD>
<TE>   In India, Vajpayee cannot be seen as soft on terrorism as his
party faces crucial state elections in February. To buttress his
"wag-the-dog" electoral arguments, Vajpayee has demanded moral
equivalency between Al Qaeda's terrorists, who seek to dismantle the
Western way of life, and Kashmir's Arab-dominated militants, whose
primary agenda is harassing India into relinquishing control over its
only Muslim majority state. All the while, New Delhi continues to
ignore calls by the United Nations and others to hold elections that
would give Kashmiris the right of self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Bold ideas are needed to bring these nations back from the brink.
Pakistan must offer the first.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf should follow the example of Philippine President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo and invite U.S. Special Forces and counter-terrorism
commandos into Pakistan to help root out foreign terrorist cells that
have decimated Pakistan's moral authority in Kashmir. One mini-step
in this direction was the announcement Tuesday by U. S. Army Gen.
Tommy Franks, commander of the Afghan campaign, that U.S. forces will
be allowed to pursue Al Qaeda terrorists fleeing Afghanistan into
Pakistan. A more comprehensive offer by Musharraf would pose little
risk now; without the Arab financing that evaporated with the World
Trade Center attacks, the large-scale violence promised by Pakistani
fundamentalists is unlikely to ever materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf should encourage indigenous Kashmiri militants like
Hizbul Moujahedeen to renew the August 2000 unilateral cease-fire
offer. In an unprecedented admission of Islamabad's official
complicity in Kashmir's guerrilla war, Musharraf last week ordered an
end to Pakistani intelligence support for non-indigenous militants
operating in Kashmir. And in a telephone call to the U.S. ambassador
in Islamabad, as reported in the New York Times, Musharraf summed up
his dilemma: Is Pakistan responsible for the behavior of every
lunatic or outraged Kashmiri who attacks an Indian official?</TE>
<TE>   Selling these steps to his army's hard-liners shouldn't be
complicated. Musharraf could point out that if they stop him, the
world community will first condemn Pakistan for its continued support
of radical Islamists and then destroy the terrorists without
consideration for sovereignty. If the army supports Musharraf, maybe
the world will muster the courage to stare down India on finally
offering a political solution for Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   By removing each part of the argument New Delhi's hard-liners have
used against Islamabad on the terrorism issue, Musharraf would
strengthen Pakistan's moderate political class, further reduce the
power of Islamic zealots and bring South Asia a giant step closer to
permanent peace.</TE>

<LD>The suicide pilot in Tampa was just another troubled American, this
time an adolescent. Nevertheless, the ease with which he carried out
his insane plan, even flying over U.S. Army Gen. Tommy Franks'
Central Command headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base, underscores
that all the Office of Homeland Security and Justice Department
measures taken since Sept. 11 have not made Americans safer from
terrorists. The United States is an open, free and complex society
with a gigantic and modern but vulnerable infrastructure.</LD>
<LD>   There are virtually unlimited possibilities for a person--not to
speak of a disciplined terrorist--to create enormous damage. If the
person is prepared to commit suicide, the possibilities expand.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive measures can close off some possibilities, like
hijacking an airliner, but the remaining options are virtually
infinite.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI could have been 10 times larger and Timothy McVeigh still
would not have been stopped.</TE>
<TE>   No one can drive a vehicle within one-quarter of a mile of the
White House without being searched. But a terrorist could drive his
bomb-laden truck to hundreds of other possible targets, including
auditoriums, stadiums and office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is safer but the rest of us aren't. It is like
living in a greenhouse and boarding up a few panes to protect from
possible rock throwers.</TE>
<TE>   We can pretty much halt the hijacking of airliners. But what are
we to do with the 200,000 small aircraft scattered around airports
and pastures? And what about the 2.3 million 18-wheelers or the 200
million handguns?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, security measures are warranted at particularly
vulnerable targets. But in our free way of life, security from within
depends essentially on the moral prestige of the existing order of
society and faith in the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Al Qaeda network remains a real threat. Military,
intelligence and police measures will be required. But international
support will be even more essential than in the Afghanistan
operation.</TE>
<TE>   As with the danger within, rooting out the Al Qaeda organization
overseas will depend in large measure on the maintenance of the U.S.
moral position in the fight against terrorist outlaws and a
perception that the U.S. also believes in the rule of law in
international relations.</TE>
<TE>   As we move into the next stage, including dealing with Iraq, let's
remember that in the long run, we need political and moral support
abroad as well as at home.</TE>

<HD>National ID: Beware What You Wish For</HD>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   This month, a little-known group is meeting to take a step that
may affect every citizen of the United States. The American Assn. of
Motor Vehicle Administrators has announced it will create a de facto
national identification card. The association reportedly is working
with the Justice Department and the General Services Administration
to create a system with a massive database encompassing every
citizen. Thus largely unknown bureaucrats could create a kind of
human license plate to track and restrict our movements--anathema in
the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, it was technically impossible or prohibitively
expensive to monitor more than a fraction of the population at any
given time. But recent advances in technology have removed these
barriers. The only thing missing was a catalyst--some event that
would substitute immediate security concerns for abstract notions of
privacy. That took place Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The smoke was still billowing from the World Trade Center when the
first calls came for a national ID card, leading to a November
hearing before a House subcommittee headed by Rep. Stephen Horn
(R-Long Beach). The hearing revealed radically different and often
conflicting views of the purpose and capabilities of such a system.
For some advocates, a card would simply provide a better form of
identification using "biometric" components such as retinal scans.
But others have called for a "smart" card connected to a database
where an individual's history and movement could be monitored.</TE>
<TE>   The rush to create a national identification card is based in part
on the false assumption that such a card could have prevented the
events of Sept. 11. This ignores the fact that the Al Qaeda
operatives who launched the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon were either recent visitors or students on visas who would
not have been required to have such cards. Moreover, the greatest
threat is the use of "sleeper" agents, terrorists who remain in the
country for years before being activated for a mission. Such agents
would be able to legally acquire cards.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there may be some real benefits to a national
identification card. France and Belgium have had such cards without
inviting tyranny. Even if a national ID card isn't warranted for the
entire population, there may be value to requiring such a card for
certain people such as international truckers or those with access to
such material as anthrax spores. And if a single form of national
identification is inevitable, it would be better for the model to be
designed and debated in Congress rather than by a collection of motor
vehicle bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Any single, uniform card is likely to be quickly integrated into
governmental and business systems to become a required form of
identification for activities ranging from driving to voting to
banking. This is why Congress must assert a national authority over
this issue.</TE>
<TE>   We need to avoid a repeat of our experience with the Social
Security number, which has become a national identifier despite the
fact that Congress expressly rejected such a use. Early Social
Security cards included the words: "This card is not to be used for
identification." Yet we allowed a system of human serialization in
which our names are little more than personal conceits connected to
the nine digits. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that "the life of
the law has not been logic; it has been experience." We have learned
from experience that governmental power operates like gas in a closed
space. As a confined space is increased, both gas and government will
expand to fill the available space.</TE>
<TE>   This is why Congress should preempt state attempts to create a de
facto national identification and prohibit freelancing agencies like
the Justice Department from helping to create such a card without
public debate or congressional approval. Instead, Congress should
establish a commission to study whether such a system is needed, how
it would work and what safeguards should be in place.</TE>
<TE>   Before we take the first step toward a human license plate, we
need to consider not just the dangers we are facing but the ones that
we may create.</TE>
<TE>   Each generation of Americans is given a constitutional legacy that
can be nurtured or negated by the exercise of free choice. Our charge
is not only to keep it safe, but also to pass it along to the next
generation in the same condition that it was passed to us.</TE>
<TE>   This crisis will pass. It is the paradox of a free people that
only the citizens of this country can seriously threaten its
foundations.</TE>

<DH>Some schools are adding Hawaiian-style shirts to the dress

good fit.</DH>

<LD>The young people are wearing aloha shirts, and the feel is of summer
vacation. Beth Powell is jogging. Tom Badum and Erik Bonn toss a
football. Megan Stevenson chats with friends and looks out at the
surf pounding the beach.</LD>
<LD>   An afternoon at a Maui resort? Try morning recess at Newport
Elementary School, right on the beach in Orange County. The
Hawaiian-themed clothing is not an extravagance but part of the
school uniform.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty nice to have to wear something like this to school,"
Megan, 10, said of her red-and-white, hibiscus-patterned outfit. "Not
many schools have this. It's cool."</LD>
<TE>   Across the region a few campuses have performed a fashion fusion,
merging the school uniform--that quasi-military method of keeping
order--with beachwear--that sartorial symbol of fun.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any tool of conformity that Californians won't turn into
an emblem of self-expression?</TE>
<TE>   Newport Elementary is one of five Orange County schools--four
public, one private--to adopt aloha prints as their uniform in the
last two years. Schools in Long Beach, on the Palos Verdes Peninsula
and in the San Fernando Valley are considering similar changes. And a
local manufacturer of beachwear has received serious inquiries from
schools in Colorado, Florida and Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like this will be the trend going forward," said Sissi
Cruse, a parent at Mariners Christian School in Costa Mesa, which
added Hawaiian prints to the dress code in the fall. "It can be cute
and fun for the kids--[it] really allows them to make a statement
while giving you the advantages of uniform dress."</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian shirt's new role as school uniform represents a
strange turn for a phenomenon long associated with variety and
vacation. The first aloha shirts were created by Honolulu tailors in
the 1930s using traditional Japanese fabrics. Even President Truman
bought into the craze, wearing one on the cover of Life magazine half
a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a certain irony in Hawaiian prints as school uniforms,"
said Josh Feldman, vice president of the Hawaiian sportswear maker
Tori Richard Ltd., which has seen steadily rising requests for
Hawaiian patterns from school choirs and sports teams. "But fashion
is cyclical."</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, Hawaiian shirts have had their moment on
the Paris runways, with aloha patterns being used on Tommy Hilfiger
pants and Gucci handbags. With the surge in sales, manufacturers
small and large have saturated the market. To find new customers for
their bulging inventories, clothiers have looked to other segments of
the garment industry.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed popularity of Hawaiian shirts and the manufacturers'
eagerness to find new markets intersected fortuitously in the summer
of 1999 in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   At Newport Elementary, a campus of 500 students in kindergarten
through sixth grade, a committee of parents and teachers was meeting
to consider a uniform. Principal Denise Knutsen suggested that
Hawaiian shirts were in fashion and might be fitting for an
oceanfront school.</TE>
<TE>   The committee organized a fashion show for parents, with students
dressed in prospective patterns. Then they held a vote among parents.
The Newport Mesa Unified School District required that a school
receive 70% support to adopt a uniform policy. The Hawaiian shirts
won 72% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't really push people to vote for or against," said
Virginia Osadche, a parent and former defense company administrator
who helped lead the effort. "But the idea of a Hawaiian theme
convinced people, even some of those who worried that their children
would lose individuality."</TE>
<TE>   Osadche selected Metropolitan Prairie, a mom-and-pop Orange County
firm, to manufacture the shirts. Its owner, Tim Bernardy, was
intrigued by the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Clothing is a mature business, and you don't see new markets open
up every day," said Bernardy, who has spent recent weeks meeting with
school districts and attending conferences of teachers and Christian
schools. "This could be just a nice niche market in the end, or it
could be something bigger."</TE>
<TE>   After months of talking, Newport Elementary selected a traditional
hibiscus print, in navy blue and white. This year, the school added
red-and-white shirts. Because it is a public school, the uniform had
to be voluntary. (Parents who want to opt out of the dress code must
sign waivers.) Still, when the uniform was launched in the fall of
2000, 800 of the shirts were sold.</TE>
<TE>   "It created excitement at first," Knutsen said. Soon, she found
that--as at thousands of other schools that have adopted more
conventional uniforms--attendance shot up and incidents of trouble on
the schoolyard declined. "It brings a relaxed kind of order. People
put on the shirt and get in the school mode. It doesn't matter so
much exactly what the shirt is."</TE>
<TE>   The move created a minor sensation in Orange County. Teachers and
custodians snapped up adult-sized versions of the uniforms. A local
businessman, insisting on anonymity, bought shirts for every student
who couldn't afford them. Inquiries from other schools came in.</TE>
<TE>   Parents at nearby East Bluff Elementary, which reopened in 1999
after 15 years of closure, added a Hawaiian shirt option to a
traditional uniform of navy blue or white tops and khaki bottoms.
Students began wearing blue or red Hawaiian shirts, with hibiscus
prints in white, last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, it has turned out to be a really patriotic
statement, with the red, white and blue colors," said Shelley
Sweeney, the mother of a first-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Three other schools adopted the Hawaiian print uniforms this fall.
Among them was Mariners Christian, a private campus of 660 students
in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. "We're pretty traditional.
We still have spelling books," Headmaster Mary Letterman said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the current school year, the school had a broadly worded
dress code, but parents and board members believed that some students
were not dressing modestly enough.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say they spent considerable time warning girls not to
expose their midriffs and boys to tuck in their shirts; something
more "uniform" was needed. The school made contact with Bernardy, and
by the fall Hawaiian shirts were part of the uniform.</TE>
<TE>   The shirts have proved particularly popular with elementary-age
students. Mariners fifth-grader Stephanie Head says she has saved 20
minutes in the morning because she doesn't have to think about what
she wears.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Grant Templeton says the Hawaiian shirt "is nice because
you're not supposed to tuck it in."</TE>
<TE>   "With the new uniforms, I have noticed a calmness in class," said
Nancy Wilder, who teaches English and the Bible at Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The only pockets of resistance are among older students. Katie
Schulte, the student body president, says eighth-graders successfully
argued to be exempted from the uniform. Few of the middle schoolers
don the shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how cool the Hawaiian shirts are anymore," said Eric
Chan, a seventh-grader. "Once it's a uniform, is it still cool?"</TE>

<HD>Expatriates Seek Time With Afghan Leader</HD>
<DH>Politics: Groups elect delegates to travel to Washington in
hopes of meeting the prime minister.</DH>

<LD>With a mix of U.S.-style democracy and Old World deal-making, Afghan
American groups in California are lining up in hopes of snagging a
meeting with Afghanistan's new prime minister during his expected
trip to Washington in the coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Potential participants from across the state are angling to meet
with Hamid Karzai, named interim prime minister last month.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody and their cousin wants to form a group, to get a
meeting," said Mohammed Daoud of Malibu, a United Airlines pilot
active in the Afghan American community in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   In the Little Kabul section of Fremont, home to what is reportedly
America's largest concentration of Afghan expatriates, an election
last weekend drew more than 1,000 voters to select 10 delegates for a
Washington trip.</TE>
<TE>   Glee over the delegate election was marred Tuesday by bloodshed
when two brothers who helped organize the vote were shot in their
Little Kabul travel agency. One died and the other was seriously
wounded by a gunman who later surrendered to police. Detectives said
the motive appears to be a personal grudge, not politics.</TE>
<TE>   "The election went well, everyone was happy, but then this
happened," lamented Waheed Momand, a former Afghan lawmaker who is
among the expatriates from Northern California tabbed to meet with
Karzai. "It is a grim day."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Afghan American leaders began to mobilize and
elect community representatives even before Karzai's ascent to his
current position. They hope to not just meet with him, but to get a
face-to-face session with President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mentioned this to the president personally," said Rep.
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). He said Bush has corresponded by
handwritten note with several Afghans from Orange County. "These are
not new faces for him."</TE>
<TE>   Kawky Anwar, president of the Southern California Afghan Women's
Assn., said she hopes to be among the California delegation, but
meetings are still being held to determine who will travel to the
nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very optimistic about his government," Anwar said.
"Hopefully, he can work with all the alliances inside the country to
make the situation better--especially the situation of women."</TE>
<TE>   Some already have a pipeline to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Noor Delawari of La Canada Flintridge and Hasan Nouri of Laguna
Hills, founding members of Afghanistan America Now, met Tuesday in
Washington with officials from the State Department and other federal
agencies to hear about reconstruction plans in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Delawari said she and other Afghans from Southern California want
to thank the president for taking steps to help rebuild the
war-shattered country. "That's primarily what we would like to do."</TE>
<TE>   But most Afghan American leaders have extra motives in seeking
face time with Karzai, Daoud suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, everybody wants to sort of remind him that they're
here," he said. "Everybody's trying to find posts in future
governments."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Afghanistan's professional and cultural elite immigrated
to the U.S. as the Soviet invasion of 1979 ushered in two decades of
nearly ceaseless warfare. Many will return only if they are assured
key positions, Daoud said.</TE>
<TE>   "If an engineer goes to Afghanistan and ends up working under a
mullah or a warlord who only knows how to use a machine gun, he's not
going to be able to get anything done," Daoud said. "It will be
frustrating."</TE>

<HD>Greenpeace to Halt Protests</HD>
<DH>Court: Group agrees not to commit civil disobedience at
U.S. sites involved in antimissile program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greenpeace USA signed a consent decree Tuesday agreeing to halt civil
disobedience at all U.S. military installations involved in the "Star
Wars" antimissile defense program.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement with federal prosecutors in Los Angeles was part of
a deal that led to the dismissal of felony charges against 14
Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists.</LD>
<LD>   The 16 defendants entered guilty pleas to misdemeanor counts as
they were about to go on trial on charges of trying to disrupt a
missile launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base in July.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the plea agreement, each defendant faces a maximum
of six months in custody, although some are expected to receive
probation.</TE>
<TE>   John Passacantando, Greenpeace USA's executive director, said that
relinquishing civil disobedience in the protest campaign was a
"worthwhile price to pay because we wanted the prosecution to drop
those completely unwarranted felony charges."</TE>
<TE>   Since its founding more than 30 years ago, Greenpeace has resorted
to civil disobedience in protests involving a wide range of
environmental issues and the nuclear arms race.</TE>
<TE>   Passacantando said the organization would continue its campaign
against the U.S. missile defense program through other means.
"Sometimes," he said, "you have to bob and weave."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, he was pleased with the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Without admitting any wrongdoing in the July 14 Vandenberg
protest, Greenpeace USA also agreed to pay a $150,000 fine to the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Greenpeace organized the demonstration to underscore its
opposition to the development of an antiballistic missile shield,
saying that it could reignite an international arms race if other
nations tried to build weapons that would counter it.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants were arrested after they defied Coast Guard
warnings and entered restricted waters off Vandenberg in small boats.</TE>
<TE>   Base officials said the only disruption occurred when two
protesters jumped into the water and swam to shore on the base. When
they emerged from the water, they had hypothermia and had to be taken
to a hospital by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The base has been the target of an increasing number of protests
because of the antimissile test program.</TE>
<TE>   Greenpeace officials said this was the first time that nonviolent
demonstrators at Vandenberg had been charged with felonies. They
accused the Bush administration of trying to intimidate protesters, a
contention denied by federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "People have the right to vigorously--but lawfully--protest
government actions, and the Department of Justice and the Department
of Defense fully believe in honoring that constitutional right," said
U.S. Atty. John S. Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, however, the defendants willfully refused to
conduct their protest in the lawfully designated demonstration area
at Vandenberg. Instead, they dangerously trespassed into the safety
zone designated under the flight path of a missile being launched as
part of a test deemed vital to national security."</TE>
<TE>   In its civil settlement with the government, Greenpeace agreed not
to violate any federal, state or local laws during anti-"Star Wars"
protests at military facilities in the United States or at the
Kwajalein atoll in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Greenpeace will be subject to a $500,000 fine if any officers,
directors or employees intentionally violate terms of the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   The ban, which also applies to the 16 defendants, is to remain in
effect for a maximum of five years or until the antimissile test
program is concluded.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow set tentative sentencing dates
of Jan. 18 and April 15. Assistant U.S. Atty. Sharon McCaslin said
the prosecution has not decided on which terms to recommend for every
defendant. Much of that will depend on a person's criminal and
military history, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Those not jailed are expected to be placed on three years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   A 17th defendant was unable to attend Tuesday's proceedings
because he is hospitalized, but the same plea agreement will apply to
him.</TE>

<HD>Simon Stresses Republican Credentials</HD>
<DH>Politics: He ignores GOP opponents and focuses his
criticism on Gov. Davis during a visit to conservative Bakersfield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. swung through this
conservative bulwark in the Central Valley on Tuesday, taking swipes
at Democratic Gov. Gray Davis as he emphasized his Republican bona
fides.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech to about 50 members of Bakersfield Republican Women
Federated at a local hotel, the investment banker said Davis should
have anticipated the expected $12-billion state budget shortfall and
prepared accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   "Aren't you ready for the governor to stop blaming people and stop
saying, 'It wasn't my fault,' and stop telling you, 'Surprise,
surprise, we have yet another crisis,'?" he asked, as the audience
loudly murmured its approval.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Secretary of
State Bill Jones are fighting to win Republican voters in the March 5
primary.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, the former federal prosecutor ignored his
Republican opponents and went after the governor, criticizing him on
a number of fronts hours before Davis' State of the State address.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar called Simon's critiques "par for
the course for all of the Republican candidates."</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to forget they have a primary to engage in," Salazar
said. "If they're trying to use the governor as a punching bag to
boost their poll numbers, Californians are going to see right through
that."</TE>
<TE>   With no political experience, Simon is little known even among
Republicans. So he used his appearance to articulate his conservative
credentials to voters in the most heavily Republican area in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   He frequently mentioned former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who was his boss in the U.S. attorney's office in the 1980s and has
endorsed him in the governor's race. And he promised to follow in the
footsteps of former President Ronald Reagan, former Gov. George
Deukmejian and President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking casually and frequently drawing applause, Simon endorsed
traditional Republican views of fiscal prudence and local control.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think bureaucrats up in Sacramento know better what's good
for Bakersfield than all of you?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," responded the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, whose father was secretary of the Treasury under President
Richard Nixon, reiterated his promise to cut the capital gains tax
from 9.3% for most Californians to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   He also hammered at the state of California's schools, calling
test scores abysmal and warning that poorly performing schools are
creating a "moral dilemma of staggering proportions."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would push schools to create business plans, add
more charter schools and enforce stricter accountability standards,
which he said have been flouted under Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also jabbed at the governor's handling of the energy crisis,
saying the state will lose billions of dollars because of the
long-term power contracts Davis negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he should be looking for another job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In answers to questions from the audience Simon toed the party
line, saying he supports tort reform, opposes bilingual education and
is against giving amnesty to illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe we should reward illegal behavior," he said to
loud applause.</TE>

<HD>NBC, Host Daly Seal Deal After Show Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC finalized a contract with television personality Carson Daly on
Tuesday after an unusual standoff had caused a last-minute
postponement of the MTV host's new late-night talk show.</LD>
<LD>   "Last Call With Carson Daly" had taped its first two installments
and was scheduled to premiere Tuesday at 1:35 a.m., but NBC pulled
the half-hour show's debut installment minutes before its scheduled
air time, apparently over a series of unresolved contractual issues.</LD>
<LD>   Given that the show already was in production and the network had
been promoting its arrival, the eleventh-hour standoff raised
eyebrows. Viewers were caught off-guard too, tuning in to find a
rerun of the Canadian comedy series "SCTV," which had been playing in
that time slot.</LD>
<TE>   Daly's popularity is largely due to his role as host of the top 40
music show "TRL," which airs on MTV, a unit of Viacom Inc. General
Electric Co.-owned NBC has been eager to co-opt Daly's young fan
base. According to a source, a sticking point was MTV's concern over
NBC's intent to sell reruns of "Last Call" to cable's E!
Entertainment Television, a practice known as repurposing. Under that
scenario, Daly--who will continue on MTV--could compete with himself
on another cable channel.</TE>
<TE>   Daly's contract at MTV did allow him to pursue outside projects,
and he landed at NBC after a previous development deal at Viacom's
CBS lapsed. In August, NBC announced that it had signed Daly to a
three-year deal, a contract that would presumably enable Daly to
appear not only on "Last Call" but other NBC programming as well.</TE>
<TE>   The three-year contract Daly signed Tuesday covers "Last Call" and
other provisions in his talent deal.</TE>
<TE>   Daly's manager, Guy Oseary, did not return calls, and his
representatives at the Endeavor Agency declined to comment, as did
executives at NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "Last Call," scheduled to air after "Late Night With Conan
O'Brien," features Daly interviewing guests in a loose half-hour
format. Daly's own celebrity is seen as a boon to the show, as
demonstrated by the guests lined up for the first week:
Grammy-nominated R&amp;B singer Alicia Keys, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and
rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight.</TE>
<TE>   The debut episode, featuring Keys, was set to air early today.</TE>
<TE>   The Daly predicament is only the latest for a late-night time
period that has been nettlesome for NBC. For years the half-hour was
occupied by "Later," which came on the air in 1988 as a one-on-one
interview show with NBC sportscaster Bob Costas. After Costas left in
1994, he was replaced by Greg Kinnear. After Kinnear departed in
1996, "Later" languished under revolving hosts, becoming a low
priority among executives at NBC.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of Daly is supposed to rejuvenate a moribund time slot
and, more important, begin to showcase him as a fresh, young NBC
personality. Instead, he became the butt of a joke on O'Brien's show
broadcast early today, after O'Brien had taped a special episode
Monday to help boost the series' premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure the show is coming up right now," O'Brien said in
signing off, "but if not, we'll talk about it tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>Defense Sector Drags Down Nov. Output</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE AVERSA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A big drop in demand for military airplanes pushed down factory
orders in November. But a wide range of goods, from computers to
cars, posted gains, suggesting better days may be ahead for the
battered manufacturing sector.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the Commerce Department's report Tuesday showed that
orders to U.S. factories fell 3.3% in November, economists were
encouraged because orders for many other categories, including the
hard-hit high-tech sector, rose.</LD>
<LD>   "It's looking to me like the manufacturing sector has hit a
bottom," said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates. "But
it is questionable how long manufacturing will be at the bottom. I
think we'll see a slow, grudging climb from here."</LD>
<TE>   A more forward-looking report released last week by the Institute
for Supply Management showed that a rise in new factory orders helped
push a key gauge of manufacturing activity higher in December,
suggesting the sector is beginning to emerge from a 17-month slump.</TE>
<TE>   In the November factory orders report, the computer and electronic
products category posted its second consecutive increase--up 1.8% in
November, after rising 8.9% in October.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in overall orders to U.S. factories in November
stemmed from an 82.4% drop in new orders for defense aircraft and
parts. The month before, orders in this category zoomed up 491.6%,
helping to boost total factory orders 7%.</TE>
<TE>   The big drop in orders for defense aircraft and parts masked gains
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding orders for defense equipment, orders to U.S. factories
rose a solid 0.8% in November, on top of an even bigger 2.9% advance
in October.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed that orders for cars rose 5.25% and commercial
airplanes and parts posted a 17.2% gain in November.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for machinery rose 2.5% in November, after slipping 0.4%.</TE>

<HD>FCC Reverses Decision to Fine Radio Station Over Rap Song</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators on Tuesday reversed themselves and said they would
not impose a $7,000 indecency fine on a Colorado Springs radio
station for airing a version of rap singer Eminem's "The Real Slim
Shady."</LD>
<LD>   The surprise about-face clears KKMG-FM, a top-40 radio station,
of charges that the station violated Federal Communications
Commission rules barring stations from airing "obscene, indecent or
profane language."</LD>
<LD>   Broadcasters and free speech advocates had decried the FCC fine
when it was issued  in June. They said the agency had singled out
KKMG for playing an "edited" version of Eminem's hit rap single that
hundreds of other top-40 stations also had aired for weeks without
incident.</LD>
<TE>   After consulting with executives from KKMG's owner, Citadel
Broadcasting, and reviewing Eminem's song again, the FCC's
enforcement bureau said they agreed with that view.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexual references contained in the song's 'radio edit'
version are not expressed in terms sufficiently explicit or graphic
enough to be found patently offensive," the FCC said.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Goodrich, general manager of KKMG-FM, could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps, a Democrat, said the
indecency issue should have been decided by the agency's top
command--its five presidentially appointed commissioners--rather than
career agency staffers.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers to Form Fuel-Cell Partnership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Department of Energy and Detroit's Big Three auto makers will
announce today that they are forming a partnership to promote the
development of emission-free fuel-cell vehicles, an automotive source
said.</LD>
<LD>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will announce government and
industry funding expected to run well beyond $100million for research
into fuel cells, which use hydrogen to produce electricity without
emitting pollutants.</LD>
<LD>   Under the program, to be called Freedom Car, the government will
join General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler in
fuel-cell research, which each of the auto makers has been pursuing
for several years.</LD>
<TE>   Freedom Car replaces the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, a program formed in 1993 to develop an 80-miles-per-gallon
vehicle for production by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, mid-size passenger sedans were the biggest sector of the
U.S. auto market. But with sport-utility vehicles filling that sector
today, the cars that the Big Three were developing have lost
relevance, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.5-billion PNGV did not specify a technology to be used to
achieve 80 mpg. Diesel-electric hybrid engines, for instance, were
considered a leading candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Car program, spearheaded by the Energy Department, is
"about stepping up to a hydrogen economy" and basing vehicle
propulsion on fuel cells, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups gave the news a mixed reception.</TE>
<TE>   The program "sounds great from an environmental standpoint"
because it would eliminate federal support of diesel-power
development, which comes with environmental problems, said Jason
Mark, Berkeley-based director of the Union of Concerned Scientists'
clean-vehicles program.</TE>
<TE>   But Mark and another expert also said they worry that the auto
makers will use the program to lobby against congressional efforts to
boost fuel-economy requirements for gasoline engines.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement will be made at the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations of the new government plans powered stocks of
fuel-cell developers.</TE>
<TE>   Plug Power Inc. rose $3.38 to $12.04, SatCon Technology Corp.
jumped $1.39 to $6.40, Ballard Power Systems Inc. gained $4.55 to
$34.96 and FuelCell Energy leaped $3.93 to $21.85.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Shares Plunge; Moody's Cuts Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of personal computer maker Gateway Inc. plunged 25% Tuesday as
Wall Street registered disappointment over the company's preview of
its fourth-quarter results.</LD>
<LD>   After the market closed the Poway, Calif.-based company got more
bad news: Credit-rating firm Moody's Investors Service said it cut
Gateway's bond rating to junk status, which could make it more
expensive for the company to raise capital.</LD>
<LD>   Before Moody's announcement the stock tumbled $2.56 to $7.69 on
the New York Stock Exchange, though it remained well above the
multiyear low of $4.24 set in October.</LD>
<TE>   Late Monday Gateway said it would be profitable in the fourth
quarter, surprising some analysts. But the company also said sales
were about $1.16 billion, less than the $1.39 billion analysts were
expecting.</TE>
<TE>   PC unit shipments fell 15% from the third quarter's 818,000 units,
instead of rising as Gateway had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Joe Burke said the company emphasized
higher-priced products instead of trying to compete with price cuts
by rivals such as Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.,
which would have eaten into profit.</TE>
<TE>   "With the focus on profitability during the fourth quarter, we
focused on the higher end of the market as opposed to chasing the low
end, the $799 PCs," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to have a greater unit volume in the
fourth quarter, but it didn't happen," he said. "Still, it speaks a
lot that we were able to get back to profitability on fewer unit
volumes. There's a positive in there."</TE>
<TE>   But investors hammered the stock on fears that Gateway is losing
the heated PC battle to Dell and others, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The larger issue is they are in a very competitive business,"
said Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Andrew Neff, who noted that Dell and
Compaq are showing increases in their PC unit shipments.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's, in cutting the rating on Gateway's debt, said the move
reflected concern over whether the second-largest direct seller of
personal computers can maintain or increase revenue and market share.</TE>
<TE>   The firm reduced its rating on Gateway's senior unsecured debt to
Ba1, or below investment grade, from Baa3. Moody's also said the
rating remains under review for further downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway has about $1.1 billion in cash and $200 million of debt,
which is a senior convertible 20-year note issued to AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s America Online. The company also has an unused $300-million
revolving credit facility maturing in September 2004.</TE>

<HD>Writers Guild Urges Rejection of EchoStar-DirecTV Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Writers Guild of America asked the Federal Communications
Commission to reject a proposed merger of the country's two major
satellite television companies, saying it could discourage diversity
in programming.</LD>
<LD>   "The continued separation of EchoStar and DirecTV is the only hope
of having three competitors for television service to the typical
home," the guild said in a statement, referring to cable television
as the third choice. "Three is vitally better than two."</LD>
<LD>   If EchoStar Communications Corp. merges its Dish Network with
larger rival DirecTV, which is owned by General Motors Corp. unit
Hughes Electronics Corp., the result will be a company with more than
17 million subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   In a filing with the FCC, the guild also expressed concern about
companies' being allowed to own broadcast and cable networks. The
union, which represents television and film writers, asked the FCC to
hold hearings in Hollywood before it relaxes rules restricting
ownership of TV stations and networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Fewer companies owning more stations, networks, cable outlets,
satellites and product will not mean better television; it will only
mean less diverse and less creative programming," said Herb Sargent,
president of the WGA East.</TE>

<HD>Hyundai Replacing Defective Engines</HD>
<DH>Autos: Exchanges are for some Santa Fe SUVs under warranty.
Critics question why authorities were not notified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Hyundai Motor America Co. celebrates its 42% increase in U.S.
sales last year, fueled in part by a growing reputation for
reliability, the company quietly has been replacing defective engines
in early models of its Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Revelation of the problem--which involved engine failure,
sometimes at highway speeds--has safety advocates again questioning
how auto makers and government regulators define safety issues. The
situation was first reported Tuesday by the Orange County Register.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman at the Fountain Valley-based U.S. arm of Hyundai Motor
Co. of South Korea said Tuesday that the failures do not represent a
safety issue and that the company is not required to launch a recall
or even notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of
the problem.</LD>
<TE>   But a car stalling on the freeway "definitely can be a safety
issue," said Sacramento safety advocate Rosemary Shahan.</TE>
<TE>   The Hyundai engine failures "definitely should trigger action" by
NHTSA, said Joan Claybrook, director of Public Citizen and a former
NHTSA administrator.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA, criticized by the Transportation Department in a report to
Congress this morning alleging inconsistent safety investigations,
has sent mixed messages.</TE>
<TE>   It held as far back as 1977, in a case involving a recall of
Plymouth Volares, that unexpected loss of power in a moving vehicle
is a safety issue. But the agency during the 1990s did not order a
recall of millions of Ford Motor Co. vehicles outfitted with a faulty
ignition module that caused stalling and occasionally fires.</TE>
<TE>   Auto safety has been a hot topic since discovery in 2000 that
several styles of Firestone tires, predominately those on the Ford
Explorer, were losing their treads and causing thousands of accidents
and hundreds of deaths and injuries. Angered by Bridgestone/Firestone
Inc.'s initial refusal to order a recall, Congress passed tough
safety legislation that made it a federal crime for an auto maker to
knowingly withhold information about defects from regulators when
those defects could cause death or injury.</TE>
<TE>   No accidents or injuries have been reported in the Hyundai matter;
the company says it believes the small number of incidents does not
represent a safety issue.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai has replaced 290 of about 7,000 engines that were built
before a flaw was discovered and a new design substituted. Hyundai
says the flaw was found in 2.7-liter V-6 engines built from March
through November 2000 and put in 2001 model year Santa Fe SUVs sold
in the U.S. from September through December 2000. Though the firm is
replacing failed engines under warranty, it is not recalling vehicles
or notifying owners of the potential problem.</TE>

<HD>Dow Slips but Nasdaq Climbs on Outlook in Tech Sector</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks were mixed Tuesday after aluminum maker Alcoa reported its
first quarterly loss in almost eight years, but technology shares
gained after a string of upbeat profit forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Comments from Altera and BMC boosted optimism that the battered
tech industry is near a rebound.</LD>
<LD>   "People are bidding up stocks in anticipation of a strong second
half," said Joel Silverstein, senior portfolio manager with Cohen,
Klingenstein &amp; Marks. "Everyone believes in tech. The only thing
they're quibbling about is the price. But what looks expensive now
may look very reasonable a few quarters out."</LD>
<TE>   Even so, investors are treading carefully before the
fourth-quarter earnings season, which heats up next week. Corporate
profits are expected to suffer their biggest drop in a decade, but
investors are more interested in corporate forecasts of an expected
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 18.64 points, or
0.9%, to 2,055.74. The index has risen four of the last five sessions
and is up 44% since Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 4.18 points, or 0.4%, to
1,160.71. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.50
points, or 0.5%, to 10,150.55, weighed down by Alcoa, which fell 82
cents to $37.34.</TE>
<TE>   Still, winners outnumbered losers by a slim margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, and by 5 to 4 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of specialty chip maker Altera rose $1.02 to $24.92. The
company said revenue would fall about 7% from the third quarter, but
added, "it appears we have seen the bottom of this cycle." Business
software maker BMC rose 87 cents to $21. The company said quarterly
earnings would be at the upper end of analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking past the first six months of 2002 and into the
first part of 2003," said Robert Arancio, head of Nasdaq trading at
Lehman Bros. "I think you'll get some outstanding performance from
tech."</TE>
<TE>   But disappointing outlooks from computer maker Gateway and media
giant AOL Time Warner kept a lid on the market. Gateway tumbled $2.56
to $7.69 and AOL lost 68 cents to $32. The world's largest media and
Internet company said it would take an accounting charge of up to $60
billion, probably the largest corporate charge on record, and reined
in forecasts of earnings growth, citing the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, a Dow member, fell $1.89 to $49.50 and FleetBoston
Financial slid 91 cents to $34.60 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said
losses stemming from Argentina's currency devaluation will reduce
2002 profits.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar fell $1.80 to $51.35 after a
Morgan Stanley analyst said new federal truck emissions standards
might hurt earnings.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * The yen fell against the dollar after the Japanese government
said it won't try to halt the currency's 3 1/2-month decline. The yen
fell to 132.74 to the dollar, compared with 131.03 on Monday. The
currency also fell against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   * Aflac climbed $2.42 to $25.54 after the No. 1 U.S. supplemental
health insurer said it would hit analysts' quarterly earnings
estimates despite lower sales in its main market in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   * Goldman Sachs Group fell $3.25 to $92.50 after Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. said it will sell its 1.8% stake in the U.S. securities
firm, ending a 15-year investment.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday's session wrapped up the first five trading days of the
new year, which saw the Dow rise 1.3%, the S&amp;P 500 climb 1% and
Nasdaq gain 5.4%. When this period finishes in the black, it often
signals a positive year for the market. Over the last 52 years, the
broad stock market has climbed in 38 years and dropped in 14 years.
Of the winning years, 28 had a positive five-day kickoff. Of the 14
losing years, 10 had declines over the first five trading days,
according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.</TE>

<HD>Congress Asks Navy to Buy Cruise Ship Built by Northrop</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Executives of Northrop  Grumman Corp. said Tuesday that the Navy has
been asked to consider buying a half-built cruise ship the company
had been making for a now-bankrupt customer. Northrop said it held
talks with members of Congress on possible military uses for the
ship.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, said it is still
in talks with the original customer--bankrupt riverboat operator
American Classic Voyages Co.--but noted it is considering all
possibilities for the partially completed ship.</LD>
<LD>   American Classic, which had planned to buy two ships for
$440million each, filed for bankruptcy protection in October, citing
the effect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The Maritime
Administration at that time refused to guarantee continued funding to
complete the ships.</LD>
<TE>   Congress inserted language into the 2002 defense appropriations
bill passed in December requesting that the Navy consider using loan
guarantees offered by the Maritime Administration to buy the two
vessels, possibly converting them into command or hospital ships.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Debt Posts Record Surge</HD>
<DH>Economy: November shoppers found interest-free car loans,
discounting hard to resist, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer borrowing rose more in November than at any time in
almost six decades as shoppers took advantage of interest-free loans
to buy new cars, Federal Reserve figures showed.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer debt increased $19.8 billion during the month, the Fed
reported. The rise was four times analysts' expectations and followed
an $11.2-billion October increase that was more than the $7.0 billion
initially reported last month.</LD>
<LD>   Cheaper financing offered by companies including General Motors
Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. helped underpin consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of an economy that's been in recession since
March of last year. Nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans,
surged in the month.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't just autos, revolving credit accelerated" as well, said
Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd. in New York. "In the absence of income, people reached for
plastic. People may be not paying off their balances and letting them
run up. It smacks more of financial distress than a stronger
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Credit card and other revolving debt increased $5.4 billion in
November, the biggest increase since a $6.8-billion rise in April.
Revolving credit declined $3.5 billion in October.</TE>
<TE>   Non-revolving loans increased $14.4 billion in November after
rising $14.7 billion a month earlier. The October increase was the
largest since a $15.7-billion jump in January 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected all consumer credit to rise by $4.7 billion
during November. The increase was the largest since the Fed started
keeping records in January 1943. Economists use the numbers to help
gauge changes in spending.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a December unemployment rate at a 6 1/2-year high of
5.8%, incentives enticed buyers. Auto sales rose 7.5% in November as
consumers bought vehicles with zero-interest financing offered by
General Motors, Toyota and other car makers. The average amount
financed for a new car was $24,934 in November, up from $24,443 in
October, the Fed's figures showed.</TE>
<TE>   November's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 18 million
vehicles. Although that was slower than the 21.3 million rate in
October, it allowed for the second-best sales year.</TE>

<HD>Farmers Insurance Seeks Another State Rate Hike</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Firm says aging housing stock justifies
fifth increase in California homeowners' premiums in two years.
Consumer advocates express outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farmers Insurance Group of Cos. has applied for a premium increase of
6.9% for homeowner insurance--its fifth rate hike request in
California in two years and one that has sparked outrage from
consumer advocates.</LD>
<LD>   If granted, the increase would mean customers of the state's
second-largest insurer would pay on average 37% more for homeowner
insurance than they did in January 2000.</LD>
<LD>   A Farmers spokeswoman said Tuesday that the rate request, made
public this week, was made because of increased costs from
water-damage claims.</LD>
<TE>   "The frequency of water-related claims has dropped, but the
severity has gone up," spokeswoman Mary Flynn said. She said aging
roofs and pipes were largely to blame.</TE>
<TE>   California's three biggest insurers have asked for permission to
increase homeowners' premiums in recent months. State Farm Insurance
Cos., the state's No. 1 insurer, was granted a 6.9% increase in
December. Allstate Corp., the third-largest insurer, is waiting for
regulatory review of its 22.3% request.</TE>
<TE>   A consumer group denounced the rate increases as excessive and
said Farmers was attempting to "fly below the radar" by asking for
multiple increases of 5% to 6.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Requests for rate increases of less than 7% do not require a
public hearing and typically are approved by the state Department of
Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sneak attack by Farmers and other insurance companies
who want to massively increase our premiums," said Doug Heller of the
Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Insurance "will be very carefully
scrutinizing this latest increase," department spokeswoman Nanci
Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-based company's four earlier rate increases were
warranted because of the insurer's rising costs and relatively low
rates, Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers "definitely needed to increase its rates" because its
premiums were so far below competitors', she said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers throughout the country have been complaining about higher
costs and an increased number of mold-related claims.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, Farmers and Allstate have stopped offering
comprehensive homeowner policies in Texas that cover mold-related
damage after suffering severe losses in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, a subsidiary of Zurich Financial Services Group, lost a
$32-million lawsuit last year over its handling of a mold claim in
Texas. The company expects water- and mold-related losses in Texas to
exceed 2001 premiums by more than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, however, said the company's latest increase request in
California was not prompted by mold concerns. Instead, she cited an
aging housing stock, including homes built in the 1960s and 1970s
with galvanized pipes are now are breaking.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators approved Farmers' request for a 6.6% increase in 2000
and two 6.9% increases and a 5% boost in 2001.</TE>

<HD>2001 Ends With Worst Holiday Shopping Season in a Decade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales at U.S. chain stores fell in the last retail week of 2001,
concluding what analysts said was the worst holiday shopping season
in a decade and suggesting weakness could persist in the new year,
two reports showed Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Given the lackluster sales results seen over the holidays,
consumer spending--which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity--is unlikely to lead the troubled U.S. economy out of a
recession that now is entering its 11th month, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg said their retail
chain store sales index slipped 0.6% during the week ended Jan. 5,
after a 0.9% rise a week earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Instinet said its Redbook retail sales average fell
3.5% in the five weeks ended Jan. 5, compared with the previous
period.</TE>
<TE>   December provided a five-week shopping month for the nation's
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Soft sales have begun translating into job losses for workers at
major retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp., one of the country's largest retailers, said Tuesday
that it will cut full-time employees who stock shelves and unload
merchandise at its Marshall Field's department store unit.</TE>
<TE>   Other retailers, including Gap Inc., Nordstrom Inc. and Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., hurt by the economic downturn have laid off employees.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of resilience, two major jewelers Tuesday reported
results that offered some signs of recovery in the luxury goods
sector, which has suffered as consumers curbed spending in the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Zale Corp., North America's largest specialty jeweler, said sales
at stores open at least one year, a key indication of retail
performance, rose 1.8% in November and December as it sorted out
inventory and merchandising problems.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany &amp; Co., which focuses on affluent consumers, said its
same-store sales for the period were down 2%, a decline analysts said
was less steep than expected as traffic picked up later in the
holiday season.</TE>

<HD>PUC Drafts Power-Cost Shift</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Proposal for divvying up charges would raise
burden for Southland consumers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California Public Utilities Commission judge Tuesday proposed
dividing $10 billion in charges for state-purchased electricity
nearly equally among all utility customers, which, compared with
earlier proposals, would shift costs away from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. and onto customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric Co.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of millions of dollars in costs would be shifted to
Southern California customers, compared with a previous PUC plan,
with the extra costs from the new proposal being split by
Rosemead-based Edison and SDG&amp;E.</LD>
<LD>   Edison declined to comment on the proposal and what it would mean
to customer rates. Ultimately, utility customers can expect to pay
the energy costs either through higher rates or, in Edison's case,
prolonging the current high rates that are locked in by its recent
settlement with the PUC to rescue Edison from its electricity debts.</LD>
<TE>   An SDG&amp;E spokesman said the proposal was unfair to the utility's
customers. PG&amp;E said it had not fully reviewed it but that the new
plan appeared more fair than the previous proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The $10 billion represents costs incurred by the state Department
of Water Resources to buy power on behalf of the three utilities this
year and last year after the California electricity market melted
down in the face of record electricity prices and a utility cash
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   A previous PUC proposal attempted to divvy up the tab according to
an estimate of what it costs the department to serve the customers of
each utility. Under that plan, which was backed by Commission
President Loretta M. Lynch but provoked furious protests from San
Francisco-based PG&amp;E, more of the costs were allocated to PG&amp;E
because it costs more to serve those customers.</TE>
<TE>   The water department originally proposed charging each utility
about the same amount per customer, a proposal similar to the one
released Tuesday by PUC Administrative Law Judge Thomas R. Pulsifer.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal is a key step in repaying the state treasury
for electricity costs. To reimburse the treasury, the state plans to
sell $12.5 billion in bonds, which would be repaid by the customers
of the three utilities. But first, several issues much be resolved,
including how much of the bond costs should be repaid by the
customers of each utility.</TE>
<TE>   Pulsifer's proposal, which could be voted on by the commission as
early as Feb. 7, is modeled after a plan suggested by the Utility
Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer advocacy group. The five
commissioners are free to make their own proposals. Under the
Pulsifer proposal, PG&amp;E customers would pay 10.047 cents per kilowatt
hour, or about $4.8 billion; Edison customers would pay 10.309 cents
per kilowatt hour, or nearly $3.7 billion; and SDG&amp;E customers would
pay 9.947 cents per kilowatt hour, or nearly $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Pulsifer said he did not think it was fair to allocate higher
costs to Northern California customers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ordered Motorola Inc. to pay $300 million to
Chase Manhattan Bank, an amount it guaranteed Chase in 1998 as part
of a loan to ill-fated satellite phone company Iridium.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Alvin H. Hellerstein ruled in New York that
Motorola remained bound by its obligation to provide a $300-million
guarantee to Chase, a unit of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., as part of
Chase's $800-million loan to Iridium.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola called the ruling a first step in the case and noted that
a trial on its counterclaim has yet to be scheduled.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the company confirmed it will lay off about 20% of its
600 top executives by April as part of the 9,400 job cuts announced
Dec. 18.</TE>

<LD>Contract manufacturer Sanmina-SCI Corp. said it will take over
production of some IBM desktop computers in the United States and
Europe in a $5-billion pact IBM said will cut its costs in the
extremely competitive personal computer industry.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes on the back of declining revenue in IBM's personal
computer and printing division. San Jose-based Sanmina-SCI will
produce the NetVista computers, IBM's main desktop line covering
several different models sold primarily to large corporations.</LD>
<LD>   IBM closed up 65 cents at $124.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sanmina-SCI was up 48 cents at $22.57 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) has asked federal regulators to
investigate whether AT&amp;T Corp. is "padding its pockets" after the
long-distance giant this week hiked some of its phone fees.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T announced last month that it would raise a key long-distance
fee it charges all customers to 11.5% from 9.9% of their monthly bill
on Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T, and most other carriers, collects money on behalf of the
Federal Communications Commission that goes toward a fund that
subsidizes phone service for schools, libraries and in rural and
inner city areas.</LD>
<TE>   But Dingell charged in his letter that the FCC does not vigorously
oversee the subsidy program. He asked the agency to perform an
investigation of the books and records of AT&amp;T to determine whether
the company in fact has collected more from its customers for the
subsidy fund than AT&amp;T has paid the government.</TE>

<LD>Antitrust enforcers are investigating whether some pharmaceutical
companies are improperly claiming patent protection for their drugs
to keep generic competitors off the market.</LD>
<LD>   The probe by the Federal Trade Commission centers on whether some
drug companies have wrongly listed their brand-name drugs in the
"orange book," a list of patent-protected drugs published by the Food
and Drug Administration, an FTC spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the drugs at issue are Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-anxiety
drug, Buspar, and cancer drug Taxol, as well as GlaxoSmithKline's
antidepressant, Paxil, according to a report in USA Today.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Bristol-Myers said the company is cooperating with
the FTC. Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne said Paxil's patents are
properly listed in the orange book. She said the company also is
cooperating with the FTC.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A court hearing on Walt Disney Co.'s request for an injunction to
prevent EchoStar Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest
satellite firm, from dropping the ABC Family channel has been
postponed.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for both companies agreed with U.S. District Court Judge
Gary Feess to reschedule the hearing to Jan. 17 to allow the court
more time to review additional briefs both sides are preparing for
the hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Feess last week granted Disney a temporary restraining against
EchoStar, which had threatened to stop broadcasting the newly
acquired channel to 6.5 million subscribers. The temporary
restraining order will remain in effect until next week's hearing.</LD>
<TE>   The nasty dispute stems from a contract battle that analysts say
highlights the challenge Disney faces in seeking rate hikes from
cable and satellite-TV operators for ESPN and other channels.</TE>

<LD>   The company, which expects to take an unspecified charge for the
moves in the fourth quarter, employs about 275,000 people. The job
cuts add to 4,900 positions that Chief Executive Alan Lacy has said
he would trim while transforming Sears stores to look more like those

<LD>Sales of new and existing homes set records in 2001, even after a
pause in sales after the Sept. 11 attacks, as low mortgage rates
spurred buying, the National Assn. of Realtors said.</LD>
<LD>   Existing-home sales rose 2.5% from 2000 to 5.25 million, and
new-home sales rose 2.5% to 902,000, the Washington-based trade group
estimated. The previous record for existing homes was 5.21 million
sold in 1999, and the old record for new homes was 885,000 in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   For 2002, the group expects existing-home sales to fall 0.5% to
5.23 million, and new-home sales to drop 3.2% to 874,000, as mortgage
rates rise to 7.3% by the third quarter.</LD>

<LD>   That position was taken by the union's national executive

are Recording Secretary Elliot Gould and Treasurer Kent McCord.</LD>
<LD>   The election was invalidated because New York members had two
extra days to vote, and because their ballots were missing a
signature line contained on ballots elsewhere. The committee
concluded that the inconsistent procedures warranted a new election.</LD>
<TE>   Gilbert, who defeated Valerie Harper, declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ballots for a new vote will be mailed by March 15 to SAG's 98,000
members, to be returned by April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Like SAG's last election, the vote challenge has continued to
split the union. Gilbert campaigned as a moderate, criticizing the
previous regime of William Daniels, who led the union on a six-month
strike against advertisers in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Harper, a vocal Daniels supporter, challenged the results. So did
Gould and McCord, who ran on Harper's ticket.</TE>

<HD>Del Taco to Open 120 New Outlets</HD>
<DH>Food: The chain's biggest expansion effort includes several
sports marketing deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Building on years of strong sales, Del Taco Inc. is planning its most
ambitious expansion effort the next two years and has ramped up its
sports marketing budget to get out the word.</LD>
<LD>   Del Taco, the nation's second-largest Mexican restaurant chain,
plans to open 120 restaurants in Western states this year and next,
boosting the number of outlets to more than 500 in 12 states.</LD>
<LD>   The privately held, 37-year-old Laguna Hills chain has signed
promotional deals with eight teams in four states, including the Los
Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz in the NBA and the Phoenix Coyotes in
the National Hockey League.</LD>
<TE>   Although Del Taco's $700,000 annual budget for sports promotions
is meager--less than 5% of Del Taco's total ad budget--a company can
build name recognition using banners and handing out free promotions
at sports arenas, said Keith Bruce, sports marketing director at
advertising agency Foote, Cone &amp; Belding.</TE>
<TE>   "The general rule of thumb is if you sponsor a major league team,
you're much more likely to be seen as a player in that market," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Del Taco cut its first sports marketing deal with the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim nine years ago to help boost the company as
it emerged from bankruptcy reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, Del Taco has been chalking up some big league
results as it expands and steps up its sports marketing.</TE>
<TE>   For 12 consecutive years, sales at stores open at least a year--a
key industry measure--have gone up. In 2001, as the Mexican fast-food
industry struggled with flat sales, Del Taco's same-store sales
climbed 6.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Its operating profit margin exceeded 10% on sales of $358.1
million. That margin is more than 25% higher than the average for
fast-food restaurants, said Tim Carlin of Technomic Inc., a research
firm near Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Although dwarfed by rival Taco Bell Corp., which operates nearly
7,000 restaurants that generate annual sales of more than $5 billion,
Del Taco has built a base of loyal customers by emphasizing food
quality, including fresh ingredients, said Janet Lowder, president of
Restaurant Management Services, a Rancho Palos Verdes consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the freshness message, Del Taco has been serving its
products in bags and cups with slogans such as, "We Don't Make It
Until You Order It," said Tim Hackbardt, Del Taco's vice president of
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The sports marketing campaign attempts to increase Del Taco's
visibility in areas targeted for major expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The chain also has signed promotional deals with the Long Beach
Ice Dogs of the West Coast Hockey League; the University of Nevada at
Las Vegas football and basketball teams; and two minor league
baseball teams, the Utah Stingers and the San Bernardino Stampede.</TE>

<HD>Rise in Fast-Food Sales Benefits Tricon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by resurgent Taco Bell, fast-food and pizza chain operator Tricon
Global Restaurants Inc. said Tuesday that sales at restaurants open
at least a year rose 3% in the fourth quarter, its best performance
since early 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Like other fast-food operators, the Louisville, Ky.-based parent
of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut has benefited from a slumping
economy, picking up some customers who have abandoned higher-priced
restaurants. But analysts said strong marketing campaigns and new
menu items also have fueled growth, especially at Irvine-based Taco
Bell, the nation's largest Mexican fast-food restaurant chain.</LD>
<LD>   Tricon said same-store sales at U.S. company-owned restaurants, a
key industry measurement, increased by 8% at Taco Bell and 7% at KFC
from the fourth quarter of 2000, while falling 5% at Pizza Hut.
Tricon owns more than one-fifth of its 20,037 U.S. restaurants. Sales
for domestic franchise restaurants were not disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a very impressive performance by Taco Bell and KFC," said
Douglas A. Christopher, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Taco Bell unveiled a series of television ads that
struck a nerve with consumers, said Andrew Barish, an analyst at Banc
of America Securities in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The spots encourage consumers to "think outside the bun" and head
to Taco Bell instead of burger joints or other fast-food restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The advertisements, Taco Bell's most popular since it muzzled its
Chihuahua 1 1/2 years ago, the chain's upgraded menu, offering
pricier items such as grilled steak-stuffed burritos and chicken
quesadillas in an effort to lure customers beyond the chain's core
market of 18- to 24-year-old men, said Greg Creed, the chain's head
of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Taco Bell's grilled steak-stuffed burrito goes for $2.89, while
such mainstays as its bean burritos and tacos typically sell for 69
cents each.</TE>
<TE>   KFC has benefited from humorous television spots featuring former
"Seinfeld" star Jason Alexander and a popcorn chicken promotion,
Barish said.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-food chains fared even better in December, with
same-store sales jumping a record 12% at Taco Bell, gaining 8% at
KFC, and increasing 3% at Pizza Hut.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tricon moved up $1 to $52.85 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company will release its fourth-quarter and 2001
earnings Feb. 11 after the close of regular U.S. trading hours.</TE>

<HD>Fed Officials Projecting Slow Economic Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve officials are out on the speaking circuit in full
force this month, and their comments generally indicate the central
bank believes the economy is recovering slowly.</LD>
<LD>   But the most important Fed view may come Friday, when Chairman
Alan Greenspan delivers a speech in San Francisco on economic policy.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Anthony Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia, predicted a slow recovery because, he said,
rising unemployment may curtail consumer spending,</LD>
<TE>   Still, in a speech in Philadelphia, he said the economy is
"valiantly trying to find its footing" and suggested it may not need
another interest rate cut. The Fed, which cut its key short-term rate
11 times last year, to 1.75% currently, will meet again Jan. 30.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta, said the recession would extend into March and growth could
be 3% in the second half of the year. But Guynn didn't rule out
another cut in the Fed's key rate.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan, meanwhile, hasn't publicly commented at length on the
economy since October, so his Friday speech is eagerly awaited.</TE>

<HD>Cisco CEO Says Sales Stable, Offers No Details</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc.'s recent orders were in line with the same stable
pattern the company experienced in previous months, Chief Executive
John Chambers said Tuesday, without offering specific sales figures.</LD>
<LD>   "Our booking linearity that we saw [earlier in the year] ...
continued again in November and December," Chambers said at a Salomon
Smith Barney investment conference in Scottsdale, Ariz. He declined
to update Cisco's financial forecast for the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The largest maker of computer-networking equipment also expects to
capture a "dramatic" additional share of the market from rivals in
its fiscal second quarter ending Jan. 26, Chambers said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Cisco, which makes gear that powers the Internet, fell
22 cents to $20.73 in after-hours trading, after closing up 42 cents
at $20.95 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers said the U.S. market still is struggling, but the company
has seen some strength in Europe. Asia has had a mixed performance,
with China feeling some of the "stress" from the U.S. economic
downturn. Japan probably will see three to five years of "challenging
times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say I knew where the economy is going ... but there's
still limited visibility," he said. "Customers are saying 'We're
planning conservatively and acting accordingly.'"</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal second quarter, analysts expect Cisco to report
operating profit of 5 cents a share on revenue of $4.54 billion. In
the year-ago period, Cisco reported earnings of 18 cents on record
sales of $6.75 billion.</TE>

<HD>Some Redwoods Show Evidence of Disease That Is Killing
Coastal Oaks</HD>
<DH>Botany: Traces of organism show up on saplings, but
scientists not sure it is harmful to the stately tree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evidence of a disease that has wiped out thousands of California
coastal oaks has shown up on redwoods, although scientists are not
yet certain whether the towering trees are susceptible to it.</LD>
<LD>   University of California researchers found genetic material from
the fungus-like organism that causes sudden oak death on samples of
sickly redwood sprouts in Berkeley and Big Sur, heightening the
potential threat of the epidemic. There is no known cure.</LD>
<LD>   Until lab tests are completed, it is not known if, or to what
extent, one of California's best known symbols could fall victim to
the infection.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you we have reason to believe they are a potential
host and we are doing experiments to see if they are," said UC
Berkeley plant scientist Matteo Garbelotto, one of the lead
researchers on the disease.</TE>
<TE>   First detected on Marin County tanoaks in 1995, sudden oak death
has been found on a growing list of plant species and in 10 counties
along California's central and north coasts.</TE>
<TE>   It has been most devastating to tanoaks, which are important to
wildlife. It has also killed some coast live oaks, beloved for their
stately elegance and one of the state's signature trees.</TE>
<TE>   If the disease proves to be fatal to redwoods, it would raise the
stakes of the epidemic, striking an important commercial timber
source and a symbol of California's natural grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists noticed signs of the disease on redwoods while on a
September field trip to observe other infected trees in Big Sur. They
collected wilted sprouts and, later, samples from redwoods on the UC
Berkeley campus.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic testing confirmed that the material contained the DNA of
Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen that causes sudden oak death.</TE>
<TE>   Lab tests were run to see if healthy redwood shoots inoculated
with the Phytophthora became infected.</TE>
<TE>   Because of contamination, the experiment had to be scrapped and
restarted, Garbelotto said. He expects results by the end of this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Even if redwoods are a host of sudden oak death, they may have
some resistance to it. It could take years of research to ascertain
whether redwoods are vulnerable, and to what degree.</TE>
<TE>   "If we started to see mortality similar to tanoaks, then we start
to worry. So far we haven't," said Garbelotto. "In my mind, I'm not
picturing a scene of total destruction [of redwoods] at all."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have confirmed the Phytophthora in California black
oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, tanoak, rhododendron, California
bay laurel, big leaf maple, madrone, manzanita, huckleberry,
California honeysuckle, toyon--a type of tree--California buckeye and
California coffeeberry.</TE>
<TE>   It has also been found on arrow wood plants growing in Germany and
The Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far confined to within 50 miles of the coast, the disease's
reach extends from Mendocino to Monterey counties and has been found
in southern Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are experimenting with treatments but have said that
in the wild, their best hope is to find ways of containing the
epidemic rather than eliminating it.</TE>
<TE>   The disease continues to progress, killing trees in infected areas
and infecting new areas. "The number of dead trees has increased,"
Garbelotto said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are unsure of the origins of the pathogen, which is
related to the organism that caused the Irish potato famine of the
1800s.</TE>
<TE>   They are also uncertain of how the disease is spread. California
and Oregon have imposed restrictions on the movement of infected wood
and hikers in infected areas are advised to wash off their shoes to
avoid the possibility of carrying the disease with them.</TE>

<HD>Avery Schreiber, 66; Jack Burns' Comedy Partner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Avery Schreiber, the portly, mustachioed comedian who struck gold
when he teamed with Jack Burns in the 1960s and was a master of both
broad and perceptive comedy, has died. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Schreiber, who had been in declining health, died Monday of a
heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The comedy team of Burns and Schreiber was best known for its
taxicab routine, with Burns as the talkative passenger, a
conventioneer who punctuates his marathon sentences with a rapid-fire
"Huh? huh? huh?" Schreiber played the long-suffering cabby.</LD>
<TE>   "Avery was my dearest friend and comedy partner for 40 years,"
Burns told The Times on Tuesday. "He was an extraordinary talent.
More than that, he was probably the most gentle, kind and
compassionate person I have known."</TE>
<TE>   With his curly black hair, bushy mustache and squinty eyes, the
teddy bear-like Schreiber had a face and body made for comedy--as
amply displayed in his memorable series of Doritos commercials in the
1970s, in which he appeared as a chef, a pilot, a judge and other
characters distracted by people loudly crunching the corn chips.</TE>
<TE>   But Schreiber sometimes lamented being a funny man instead of a
leading man, a confession that once prompted a reporter to tactfully
point out that Schreiber was hardly Cary Grant.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a Cary Grant in there trying to get out," Schreiber
replied, tapping his ample tummy. "Once, I gave the business its
chance. Shaved off the mustache, clipped the eyebrows, had my hair
styled and dieted down as svelte as a gazelle. I was the man I left
behind 12 years ago. I could not get a job. Out of frustration, I
started eating again. As long as I got fat, I grew the mustache and
went back to work."</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber, who studied directing at the Goodman Theater Drama
School in his hometown of Chicago, joined the improvisational comedy
troupe Second City in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just fun and smart and inventive and very generous on
stage," said comedian Joan Rivers, who worked with Schreiber on stage
at Second City in 1963. "He had the mustache and that buffoon look,
but he was very smart."</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber met Burns, a onetime Boston newscaster who previously
had been teamed with comedian George Carlin, when Burns joined Second
City in 1962. Two years later, they were part of a Second City revue
that went to New York, where they were spotted and signed by
well-known show business manager Bernie Brillstein.</TE>
<TE>   Within a month, Burns and Schreiber made their debut as a comedy
team on Jack Paar's weekly TV show, where they did their signature
taxicab routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a marriage of opposites," Burns said of their onstage
chemistry. "He was Jewish, I was Irish. He was mellow and sweet and
optimistic and I was angry and cynical and pessimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Burns and Schreiber were a smash on the Paar show. Appearances on
"The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Hollywood Palace" and other variety
shows followed.</TE>
<TE>   "When we broke up the act [in 1968], it was because they wanted us
to do the same routines over and over," Schreiber later told The
Times. "When we started working together in the Second City, we
improvised all kinds of situations with all sorts of
characters....But we found ourselves doing nothing but the cab driver
and his fare everywhere we went."</TE>
<TE>   Avery and Schreiber began working as a team again in 1972, after
getting together for a benefit in Los Angeles. In 1973, ABC gave them
a summer variety series, "The Burns and Schreiber Comedy Hour."</TE>
<TE>   Cecil Smith, The Times' TV writer, raved about the team's comedy
special that preceded the weekly series, calling it not only funny
but literate and articulate:</TE>
<TE>   "I mean how often do you find a comedy team ... doing a sketch in
which an integral part is the recitation of an alliterative lyric
poem by the Jesuit mystic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins? On television?"</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber enjoyed skewering politicians. Among his and Burns'
albums was "The Watergate Comedy Hour."</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber appeared in a number of TV series and movies, including
"My Mother the Car" and "Days of Our Lives" on television, and the
Mel Brooks' film "Robin Hood: Men in Tights."</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared frequently on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber is survived by Rochelle, his wife of 40 years; and two
children, Jenny of San Francisco and Joshua of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>H.L. 'Buck' Ayres, 89; Lido Shipyard Founder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>H.L. "Buck" Ayres was standing on a sea wall in Ensenada, Mexico,
watching a sailboat race in 1949 when a chance encounter changed his
life.</LD>
<LD>   A man standing next to him noticed that Ayres, who was working for
an oil company in the San Fernando Valley, seemed to know all there
was to know about the boats.</LD>
<LD>   The man told him he had property that would be perfect for a
shipyard.</LD>
<TE>   The next weekend, the two visited the site, and soon Ayres founded
the Lido Shipyard. Over the next 36 years, it became one of the
largest private yacht-repair facilities in Southern California, and
Ayres became a well-known figure in local yachting circles.</TE>
<TE>   Ayres died Thursday of natural causes in the Newport Beach
townhome where he had lived since 1986. He was 89.</TE>
<TE>   Born the son of a grocery store owner in Riverside on May 8, 1912,
Ayres attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he was a
star guard on the football team that won the Southern California
championship in 1930. Barred from military service during World War
II because of football injuries, Ayres worked for Douglas Aircraft
Co. and, later, Standard Oil.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the meeting at the sea wall, during which he revealed
the love of boating he had had as a weekend sailor since his youth.
Ayres immediately moved to Newport Beach with his new wife, Helen.
For nearly the next four decades, he reported for work at the
77,000-square-foot facility he leased at 900 Lido Park Drive.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the nicest guys you ever knew; never got mad, got
along well with people, and I don't recall us ever having a fight,"
said Harold Steck, 85, who worked at the shipyard for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Ayres' son, Patrick, 51, who became the shipyard's president,
agreed. "At 6-[foot]-4 and 200 pounds, Dad was an imposing figure,
but he was just a big teddy bear. He was very gentle and caring."</TE>
<TE>   Ayres was a member of the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce,
served on the board of governors of the Balboa Bay Club and was
active in the Newport Harbor Yacht Club, the Los Angeles Yacht Club,
the Avalon Tuna Club and the St. Francis Yacht Club of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The closing of the Lido Shipyard in 1985 because of a dramatic
rent increase marked the passing of one of the last great yards known
for its intricate craftsmanship in the building and repair of wooden
yachts.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, Ayres and his wife divided their time between their
home in Newport Beach and a stage coach inn they had converted to a
second home on the Klamath River in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "If he didn't have something to do, he'd dream up a project,"
Patrick Ayres said. "In my entire life, I never saw my family hire a
plumber or a carpenter or a painter."</TE>
<TE>   Helen Ayres died in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Until the end, Patrick recalled, his father remained mentally
sharp and active.</TE>
<TE>   "He could tell you about boats he'd sailed on in the 1930s and
'40s," the son said. "He was quite a storyteller. He made me want to
be a better person, to live up to the kind of person he was. He stood
for honesty, gentleness, friendship and generosity."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Ayres is survived by a sister, Doris
Ritchie of Fullerton, and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A graveside service will be private, but a memorial service is
scheduled for Jan. 19 at the Newport Harbor Yacht Club. For more
information, call Patrick Ayres at (714) 751-0285.</TE>

<HD>Dave Thomas, 69; Founded Wendy's Chain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Thomas, the folksy founder of Wendy's Old-Fashioned Hamburgers
who parlayed his taste for good food and friendly service and an
innate knack for talking to people from their television sets into
one of the world's most successful fast-food chains, died Tuesday. He
was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas, an adoptee who over the past decade waged an aggressive
campaign to promote adoption in America, died at his Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., home of liver cancer, company spokesmen said.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas had been undergoing kidney dialysis since early last year
and had a quadruple heart bypass five years ago after suffering a
heart attack.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Atlantic City, N.J., to unwed parents, Thomas was quickly
adopted but lost his new mother to rheumatic fever when he was 5. His
father, a construction worker, introduced him to three successive
stepmothers and a dozen homes before he was 15. Given those unusual
beginnings, R. David Thomas seemed an unlikely candidate to become an
internationally recognized restaurant tycoon.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at his death he remained what Wendy's Chairman Jack Schuessler
called "the heart and soul of our company," which has 6,000
restaurants around the world and, with its Canadian subsidiary Tim
Hortons, has sales of more than $8 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the high school dropout finally earned his equivalency
diploma in 1993, his classmates had good reason to vote him most
likely to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Two lessons from Thomas' early life set him on his course, he said
in his three autobiographical books, the 1991 "Dave's Way: A New
Approach to Old-Fashioned Success," the 1994 "Well Done: Dave's
Secret Recipe for Everyday Success" and the 2000 "Franchising for
Dummies."</TE>
<TE>   First, his adoptive maternal grandmother Minnie Sinclair, the only
relative who gave him a sense of security, taught him to value hard
work as a pleasurable, constant companion.</TE>
<TE>   Second, his frequent visits to cheap restaurants with his father
made him decide, he wrote, "to own my own restaurant because I liked
to eat, and I just thought restaurants were really neat, exciting
places."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas worked odd jobs as a boy, delivering groceries, working at
a soda fountain and tending a restaurant counter. At 15, he began
working as a busboy at the Hobby House restaurant in Fort Wayne,
Ind., and when his father decided to pull up stakes, Thomas declared
himself emancipated and moved into the YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   His boss, Phil Clauss, became a mentor and, after Thomas served as
an Army cook in West Germany during the Korean War, promoted him to
assistant manager of his newest restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   It was in Fort Wayne that Thomas met another mentor, Col. Harland
Sanders, who stopped by to promote his Kentucky Fried Chicken
franchises.</TE>
<TE>   Clauss acquired four KFC franchises in Columbus, Ohio, and, when
they did poorly, sent Thomas to turn them around in exchange for 45%
ownership. Thomas succeeded, and in 1968 sold his interest back to
KFC for $1 million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he established his own company, opening the first
Wendy's in Columbus on Nov. 15, 1969. The name was the nickname of
his daughter Melinda Lou, who was 8.</TE>
<TE>   With its homey decor of carpets, Tiffany-style lamps and bentwood
chairs, a friendly staff and food cooked to order, the restaurant
quickly flourished. Within six weeks, Thomas turned a profit, and
within four years he was negotiating franchise arrangements for
entire cities and geographical regions.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1970s, profits of the Dublin, Ohio-based corporation
were soaring, and in 1982 Thomas stepped down as chief executive and
went to Florida to play golf.</TE>
<TE>   A catchy "Where's the beef?" ad campaign kept the chain growing
for a few years, but then business sagged because, in Thomas'
opinion, service "began to get sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   So in 1989, after installing James Near as Wendy's chief
executive, Thomas went back to work as roving quality-control man and
chief spokesman. Unhappy with the commercials that replaced the
oft-quoted ones about meaty hamburgers, Thomas went off to talk to
the advertising agency.</TE>
<TE>   His pep talk on how Wendy's makes hamburgers and treats customers
was so convincing that the admen decided to have Thomas tell the
story on camera.</TE>
<TE>   The founder, who thought he might make one or two commercials,
proved a durable pitchman, making more than 725 humorous ads that
often featured foreign locations or celebrities such as bluesman B.B.
King, soap opera star Susan Lucci and ice skater Kristi Yamaguchi.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's sales zoomed, and Thomas soon became so well-known that
people all over the world felt comfortable initiating conversations
with "Dave."</TE>
<TE>   No trained actor, the chief executive with the limited education
had trouble making the commercials until producers stopped putting
their perfectly written phrases in his mouth and let him talk in his
own scrambled syntax. By one somewhat tongue-in-cheek estimate,
shooting the first 10 years of the ads required more than 619,000
miles of film, 10,000 hours of editing and 1.1 million cups of
coffee.</TE>
<TE>   But the results were indisputable. As one financial analyst said
in 1991, Thomas "has given Wendy's a corporate identity ... a
down-homey type image. The lack of sophistication is a real benefit
for the company."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how successful he became, Thomas never forgot his
adoptive roots or his sense of abandonment when he finally learned at
the age of 13 that he was adopted. He told The Times in 1999 he felt
so ashamed that he never mentioned his adoption until the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He was giving a motivational speech to Wendy's managers and told
of his adoption to illustrate his point that success was not based on
having a privileged background. One manager suggested that Thomas go
public with his story to raise public awareness of the importance of
adoption--sparking a personal crusade that would last the remainder
of Thomas' life.</TE>
<TE>   "Every child deserves a home and love. Period," Thomas said to
anybody or group who would listen, including Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Thomas headed former President George Bush's adoption
initiative, Adoption Works ... for Everyone. Thomas spoke to
corporate America and government employers about creating adoption
benefits for employees and started Wendy's corporate adoption
program. He promoted adoption of older and handicapped children, and
posed for posters, surrounded by children and stating: "Adopt a
special child. They grow up to be special people."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he founded the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption to
raise awareness about the issue's importance, and devoted his
speaking fees and profits from his books to support it.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is survived by his wife, Lorraine; five children, Pam, Ken,
Molly, Melinda Lou and Lori; and 16 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>L. Mitelberg, 82; French Political Cartoonist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Louis Mitelberg, a cartoonist who for decades lampooned political
leaders such as former French President Charles de Gaulle, died
Monday. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   The cartoonist, sculptor and former Resistance fighter died at a
hospital in Paris, said his wife, Zuka. The cause of death was not
immediately known, but he had been hospitalized since June after a
heart attack, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Born Jan. 23, 1919, in Kaluszyn, Poland, Mitelberg moved to Paris
in 1938 to study architecture. He joined the French army a year later
and was captured by the Nazis in 1940.</LD>
<TE>   He escaped to Russia in May 1941, then made his way to London,
where he joined the French Resistance and began his career as a
cartoonist. He was naturalized in France after the war.</TE>
<TE>   He received three medals, including the prestigious Croix de
Guerre--the War Cross--for his wartime service.</TE>
<TE>   Mitelberg, who worked for the weekly magazine L'Express from 1958
to 1990 and used the pseudonym Tim, created his cartoons with a
mixture of fierce wit and stinging sarcasm.</TE>
<TE>   One of his favorite targets was De Gaulle, who was featured in the
cartoonist's first book, "Une Certaine Idee de la France" (A Certain
Idea of France), published in 1969. He produced two other books in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, where his drawings appeared in publications
such as Time, Newsweek and the New York Times, Mitelberg received the
Distinguished International Cartoonists Award in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, a native of Los Angeles who is a
prominent artist in her own right; sons Roland and Francois; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A private cremation ceremony has been scheduled for Monday.</TE>

<HD>James Armstrong, 73; Mayor and Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James R. Armstrong, the high school government teacher who put theory
into practice by getting elected to the Torrance City Council and
then serving as mayor, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong, a councilman for six years and mayor for eight before
his retirement from politics in 1986, died Friday at Harbor UCLA
Medical Center of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Dr.
Julie A. Armstrong.</LD>
<LD>   Although the mayor's post he held from 1978 to 1986 is largely
ceremonial, Armstrong was so well-known for his rapport with federal,
state and local politicians that he was able to accomplish a good
deal for the city.</LD>
<TE>   A Torrance Chamber of Commerce poll in 1980 ranked him as the most
influential man in the area. And in 1982, Harvey Schecter, regional
director of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Times: "He may not
have real power, but he has a lot of symbolic power."</TE>
<TE>   At Schecter's recommendation, the ADL gave Armstrong its
Distinguished Public Service Award because he had spoken out
forcefully against bigotry in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   During Armstrong's tenure as mayor, he doubled city park space and
worked for more senior citizen housing and the environmental
protection of the Madrona Marsh.</TE>
<TE>   Educated at Pepperdine University and UCLA, Armstrong taught U.S.
government at Torrance High School from 1954 to 1986. He gradually
began applying what he taught to governing his community. He served
on the Torrance Beautiful Commission and the city Planning Commission
before winning election to the City Council by a wide margin in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching government, Armstrong told The Times as a new councilman
in 1973, was "the perfect foundation" for government service. While
on the council, he continued teaching, often assigning students to
attend the Tuesday night council meetings and then discussing the
issues in the classroom the next day. He also served simultaneously
as district representative for Rep. Charles H. Wilson (D-Torrance),
giving him insight and input on federal legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how thoroughly Armstrong understood the concepts of
governance, however, after he began practicing it, he conceded, "I
had a few surprises.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes time to get things done," he said, adding that the city
government process can be downright "ponderous."</TE>
<TE>   A Democrat, Armstrong was often mentioned as an attractive
possible candidate for higher office. But he dismissed such talk,
saying he did not want to "punish myself" by waging a losing battle
against the area's strong incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   "I was elected to be mayor of the city, and I will not jeopardize
what might be in the city's best interest for something that might be
in my best interest," he said in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "When my term as mayor ends, I expect to ... go out with [wife]
Anne and have a steak. Then I'll fade out of the public light."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong did essentially that. He retired from teaching and
politics and became a consultant and lobbyist, first for the
development firm Real Property Resources Inc. and then for his own
Armstrong Associates.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 45 years; sons Jim of Morgan Hill,
Calif., and Jeff of Mooresville, N.C.; daughter Julie of Los Angeles;
and several grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral was private. A public memorial service is being
planned for February. The family has asked that any memorial

<HD>Airlines Extend Steep Ticket Price Discounts</HD>
<DH>Travel: With a 20% to 30% drop in business fliers, carriers
prolong deals to fill seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still losing millions of dollars a day, the nation's major airlines
are continuing to sharply discount fares to lure leisure travelers,
at least, amid the post-Sept. 11 travel slump.</LD>
<LD>   The two largest domestic airlines, American and United, had sales
that were supposed to end Dec. 28 for travel until May 19. But with
the busy Christmas travel season over, the cheaper tickets are still
here, as the two airlines announced in full-page newspaper ads
Tuesday. This time the sales--still for travel until May 19--are to
end Jan. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Yet that date probably won't mark the end of the savings boon for
consumers, analysts said. There's a strong chance the fare sales will
linger well into the year, as the airlines strive to guarantee at
least a minimum number of passengers before the summer.</LD>
<TE>   It's imperative the airlines do so because they can't count on the
steady income they once enjoyed from business fliers, who typically
don't book well in advance and thus pay higher fares and generate
most of an airline's revenue, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Business travel, which already was dropping before Sept. 11,
remains 20% to 30% below a year ago and isn't expected to rebound
until the U.S. economy does, perhaps in the latter half of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The extension of the fare sales is an indication of a continuing
soft market" for air travel overall, said Richard Bittenbender, an
analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The sales reflect the airlines' desire "to get at least some base
level of traffic locked into the system ... and then see how the
circumstances develop for the higher-fare business travelers," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines also is running a sale for travel through March
14, and US Airways has one for travel completed by Feb. 12.
Northwest, Southwest and America West also are among those offering
various winter promotions.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases the discounts apply to both domestic and foreign
flights, though they cover different travel periods. For example,
United is offering one-way flights from Los Angeles to London for
$151 each way based on a round-trip online purchase, but for travel
only through March 20.</TE>
<TE>   The sales have a host of other restrictions. But the carriers also
are paying bonus frequent-flier miles during the sales, and they're
typically knocking an extra 10% off the price if the reservations are
made online, because that reduces the airlines' ticket-distribution
costs.</TE>
<TE>   And airlines are desperate to cut costs wherever possible. The
one-two punch of the weak economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
saddled the industry with losses of $6billion to $10billion for 2001,
and there will be more red ink for at least the first half of this
year, analysts estimate.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 2002, however, "we expect [customer] demand to be
fully recovered from post-9/11 terrorism fears ... and from fear of
long lines" due to heightened airport security, analyst Brian Harris
of Salomon Smith Barney predicted in a report Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he forecasts that many of the major carriers--such as
American, United, Delta, Northwest and US Airways--still will report
losses not only for this year but for 2003 as well.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the airlines need to fill seats. American decided
to extend its winter sale after seeing how well the traveling public
responded to the cheaper tickets late last year, said American
spokesman Emilio Howell.</TE>
<TE>   But not enough responded, as the sales' extension shows. And
travelers--already accustomed to years of fare wars between
airlines--appear confident that if one sale ends, another is right
around the corner because airlines are in such dire straits, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices are going to stay low, and I think these sales are going
to continue," said Bob Jones, an analyst at OneTravel.com, an
Internet travel-services concern. "For the airlines, that means
they're almost living on a two-week planning cycle" of trying to
gauge passenger trends because "they're not selling their typical
amount of leisure, long-term seats."</TE>
<TE>   Airline stocks were mixed Tuesday. The American Stock Exchange's
index of airline shares edged up 0.20 point to 97.26 points.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Ends Program to Fingerprint Car Renters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dollar Rent a Car pulled the plug Tuesday on a trial program that
required customers to be fingerprinted.</LD>
<LD>   Dollar instituted the practice after Sept. 11, saying the
terrorism attacks were such a disaster for its bottom line that a
bold approach was required to combat fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Banks sometimes require a fingerprint for certain transactions,
but Dollar's foray into fingerprinting marked the first time a
corporation routinely demanded that consumers submit to a procedure
associated with criminals.</LD>
<TE>   Dollar required customers at 14 airports, including Los Angeles
International and San Francisco International, to ink their thumbs
and put their imprint on car rental contracts. The thumbprints were
filed away with the contracts, though customers were given the option
of having the thumbprint torn off when they returned the car.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a stigma associated with putting a thumb on a pad,"
conceded Jim Senese, Dollar's vice president of quality assurance.
"But 99.8% of the customers were supportive."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the three-month test ended 22 days early because fraud,
which costs the company $1 million a year, didn't appear to be
shrinking. "The anticipated savings just weren't compelling enough,"
Senese said.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Tulsa, Okla., Dollar is part of Dollar Thrifty Automotive
Group Inc. Dollar is the sixth-ranked car rental company by revenue.
Since Sept. 11, it has cut its car fleet by 17% and reduced
headquarters staff by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians and privacy experts had criticized the
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of options out there in car rental, and I would
deal with companies that do not begin with the presumption that its
customers are potential criminals," said Charles Whitebread, a
professor at University of Southern California Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement experts also were dubious, but mainly because they
didn't think it would work.</TE>
<TE>   "Dollar was doing this for the right reason: to combat fraud,"
said Robert J. Castelli, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal
Justice in New York. "But it was introduced without the proper
preparation."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Castelli said he expected many similar experiments.
"If there's one thing 9/11 taught us, the heightened security that
exists all over the rest of the free world is there for a reason.
This trend toward increased security is going to continue."</TE>
<TE>   Several customers waiting for their cars at the San Francisco
airport last week said they hadn't been warned about the
fingerprinting, a fact that increased their disgruntlement. Neither
the Dollar Web site nor the telephone customer service employees had
told them a thumbprint would be required, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bit of nibbling away at our civil rights," said Ian
Bolton, a tourist from Melbourne, Australia. "It's Big Brother."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Bunge, a Harvard student, said it didn't bother him. "If a
thumbprint is going to get me a car faster, I'm all for it," he said.
But Ivy Tam, a San Francisco State student, was dubious. "It makes me
kind of worried. No other company is doing this."</TE>
<TE>   That was another reason Dollar canceled the program. It had hoped
the industry leaders, Ford Motor Co.'s Hertz and Cendant Corp.'s Avis
Group, would announce similar programs, but neither did.</TE>
<TE>   Although several San Francisco customers said they would think
twice about renting from Dollar again, the company's own tracking
revealed extensive approval.</TE>
<TE>   Dollar said that in the first month, 55 customers complained and
refused to rent; 150 complained but rented anyway; and about 50
people sent in angry e-mails. Results from the second month were
similar.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to know how many potential thieves were deterred.
As Senese noted, some of the people who walked away might have had
plans to keep the car.</TE>

<HD>Cheney or Staff Met Enron Execs 6 Times</HD>
<DH>Energy: A White House letter says the company did not
discuss its financial problems at the meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney or members of his energy task force met
six times last year with executives of Enron Corp. but did not
discuss the energy company's financial problems that led to the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, according to a White House letter
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The letter was the first detailed response by the vice president's
office to congressional inquiries about meetings Cheney and his staff
held with outside interests while drafting energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   David S. Addington, counsel to the vice president, said Cheney and
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay met for a half-hour
April 17 to discuss energy policy, including California's energy
crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Enron representatives met with the vice president's staff on five
other occasions, Addington said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to Cheney on Tuesday, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles), who has sought details of the meetings, said the
disclosures show that "the access provided to Enron far exceeded the
access provided by the White House to other parties interested in
energy policy."</TE>
<TE>   Addington, however, said the energy task force staff was meeting
during that same period with a broad range of individuals involved in
energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's staff first met with Enron executives Feb. 22. Their last
meeting was Oct. 10, six days before the company's slide began.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million
and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Nov.
8, it announced it had overstated its earnings by $586 million during
the last four years. The company filed for protection from its
creditors Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron did not communicate information about its financial
position in any of the meetings," Addington said in a Jan. 3 letter
to Waxman.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, who initially wrote the White House last month seeking
information about the meetings, said the disclosures raise additional
questions about the extent to which Enron may have influenced the
administration's energy policy. The task force's report, released in
May, called for expanded drilling for oil and gas on public land,
more rapid approval processes for power plants and greater use of
nuclear power, among other recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   And in his Tuesday letter to Cheney, Waxman asked the vice
president to provide more information, including copies of any
documents discussed and records of any e-mails and telephone calls
between Enron executives and White House officials.</TE>
<TE>   The White House indicated to news services late Tuesday that no
additional information would be provided.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange of letters between Cheney's office and Waxman, the
top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, was the latest
development in a months-long controversy expected to heat up in
coming weeks as several congressional committees investigate Enron's
collapse. One probe is likely to touch on President Bush's ties to
Lay, a major donor and fund-raiser for Bush in the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bush recently said he had no recent contact with Enron executives
and he would let the probes lead where they may.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney had resisted congressional efforts to learn about the
private meetings held by the task force. But Waxman, citing Enron's
collapse, urged Cheney in December to reconsider his position.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the White House energy plan contend that industry
leaders were influential in shaping policy. Administration officials
defend the secrecy, saying it was necessary to foster a free exchange
of ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cheney's office provided some details of the meetings
with Enron officials, the dispute over how much information should be
made public about the meetings appears far from over.</TE>
<TE>   Addington told Waxman that the information was being provided "as
a matter of comity between the legislative and executive branches,
with due regard for the constitutional separation of powers, and
reserving all legal authorities and privileges that may apply. It is
our hope that submission of the information will help you avoid the
waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary inquiries."</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that the day after his meeting with Lay, Cheney
spoke out against the use of price controls to bring down
California's soaring electricity costs. Cheney, however, already had
been on record against price controls.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Enron confirmed it received bids for a controlling
stake in its energy-trading unit, according to Bloomberg News. But it
would not confirm published reports identifying the bidders,
including Citigroup Inc. and UBS.</TE>

<HD>State Blocks Effort to Curtail Terror Coverage</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Proposal to restrict homeowners' claims--an
about-face by firms--is arbitrary, commissioner says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators Tuesday blocked a move by insurers to limit
terrorism coverage for California homeowners, slowing the industry's
push to curtail such coverage nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The effort to restrict terrorism coverage for homeowners is an
abrupt about-face for insurers, which until now have said insurance
for homes, cars and other personal coverage would not be directly
affected by the aftermath of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Insurance made the issue public
Tuesday when Commissioner Harry Low formally denied insurers' initial
request to exclude terrorism coverage for both commercial and
homeowner insurance in the state. Low invited insurers to modify the
guidelines or ask for a hearing on the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Low said regulators are "open-minded" about limiting terrorism
coverage for commercial insurance but are more skeptical about
providing similar limits for homeowners' insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like a lot more clarification on how this impacts
homeowners," Low said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Low said he could not rule out granting such exclusions if
insurers could make a reasonable case that the limits are necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The industry guidelines would free insurers from having to pay any
terrorism-related claims when acts of terrorism within a 72-hour
period nationwide cause more than $25 million in insured losses or
kill or severely injure 50 or more people.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting the exclusions, Low denounced the thresholds as
"unreasonably low," "overly broad" and "arbitrary."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers asked state regulators to approve the guidelines for
commercial insurance after Congress failed to enact legislation that
would have limited insurers' risk. Insurers say they can pay the
estimated $40 billion to $70 billion in claims stemming from the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon but could be wiped
out by future terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines were submitted to all 50 states in November by the
Insurance Services Office Inc., an industry advisory group. In
mid-December, the ISO quietly added additional guidelines that would
extend the exclusion to homeowners insurance, said Christopher
Guidette, an ISO spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   California and New York are among the few states to reject the
terrorism exclusion for commercial insurance. Forty-one other states
and the District of Columbia have approved the limits for commercial
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Guidette said several states are considering the homeowners
exclusion as well, although only two, which he declined to identify,
have so far approved it.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers that initially believed terrorism was primarily an issue
for businesses have since realized their liability may extend well
beyond commercial coverage, an insurance industry spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many companies have said they couldn't envision something that
would impact homeowners, but then again we couldn't envision Sept.
11" before it happened, said Don Griffin, head of business and
personal lines for the National Assn. of Independent Insurers.</TE>
<TE>   An airborne toxin or poisons in the water could make entire
communities uninhabitable, and homeowner insurance companies would be
forced to pick up much of the tab, Guidette said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be limited to planes crashing into buildings,"
Guidette said. "The exposure to insurers for homeowners [coverage]
could be staggering."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates said insurers shouldn't be allowed to escape
liability for terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly the kind of risk people require insurance for,"
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "At some point, a homeowners policy is
going to be worthless, because everything has been excluded."</TE>

<HD>Wendy's Challenge: Maintaining Its Brand Image Without Dave</HD>
<DH>Advertising: The folksy pitchman's role had been reduced,
but the chain hopes goodwill he fostered will live on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as consumers view Charles Schwab as the personification of
low-cost investment services and saw Herb Kelleher as the voice of
Southwest Airlines, Dave Thomas was the public face of Wendy's
International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   But after Thomas' death Tuesday of liver cancer, Wendy's said it
no longer plans to use the founder in its advertising. The Dublin,
Ohio-based company years ago had started reducing his ad presence.</LD>
<LD>   Now, branding experts say, the nation's third-largest fast-food
chain faces the challenge of transferring goodwill generated by the
affable burger baron into enhancing the company's overall brand image
without him.</LD>
<TE>   Branding experts say it's dangerous to lean so heavily upon a
single person.</TE>
<TE>   "Some figureheads represent all about a company that is grand,"
said Noah Manduke, Los Angeles-based managing director of Siegelgale,
a corporate-identity firm. "And in those cases, the sudden absence
can be quite destructive."</TE>
<TE>   But like Chrysler Corp. after Lee Iacocca's retirement or Kentucky
Fried Chicken after Col. Harland Sanders' death, strong brands can
survive the loss of a person who put a human face on a big
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   And companies won't stop seeking out leaders with a distinct
commercial appeal if it can give them a competitive edge, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the growing sophistication of consumers raised on music
videos and other high-octane Hollywood entertainment, Americans
remain willing to embrace a straight-talking spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at New York City with [former Mayor Rudolph] Giuliani," said
Michael A. Kamins, a USC marketing professor. "If that man told you
to come to New York City and spend money, you'd do it."</TE>
<TE>   Few of the corporate world's public faces are as well known as
Thomas, who was 69. Thomas founded the Wendy's chain in 1969 and
retired from active management in the early 1980s. He agreed to
return as product pitchman in 1989 and subsequently filmed 800
commercials for the chain, including spots with such diverse co-stars
as blues singer B.B. King and soap opera star Susan Lucci.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's said it has no plans to replace Thomas with another highly
visible spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The chain on Tuesday suspended advertising nationwide, but when
commercials return, the same spots will be running-- but without
Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "David will certainly not appear in advertising going forward,"
said Donald F. Calhoon, a senior vice president and longtime Thomas
associate.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's began to trim Thomas' role in advertising several years
ago after the company's marketing team met to plot long-term
advertising strategy and Thomas' role in it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a legitimate question, one that any responsible marketing
manager would ask and begin to plan for," Calhoon said. "There's been
less and less of him in recent years, and that's by design."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas used to dominate Wendy's television commercials. But in the
last two years the company founder made "cameos" that were tacked
onto the end of spots, Calhoon said. Wendy's and longtime advertising
agency Bates Worldwide will run the same spots when advertising
resumes this month, but Thomas' segments will be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's challenge will be to transfer what consultant Manduke
described as Thomas' special qualities--"the hometown feel, the
genuineness and authenticity" that Thomas brought to the screen.
Because few viewers believed Thomas was actually in the kitchen, the
transfer might move smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   The chain's biggest danger "is if they're asleep at the switch and
do nothing," said Kevin Walker, a partner with Boardwalk, a
Glendale-based brand management firm. Despite its successes, Wendy's
remains a small player in the fast-food arena, and it is competing
for customers with such giants as McDonald's Corp., Burger King  and
Taco Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Branding experts say it might be more difficult to weather the
loss of an active executive such as Schwab, who helped create the
concept of low-cost brokerages and clearly remains at the helm of the
discount brokerage bearing his name. At Schwab, the founder is more
than just the personification of the company, Manduke said. "Schwab
seems much more obviously dependent upon his stewardship."</TE>
<TE>   Branding experts also caution against believing that a company
will necessarily struggle after losing a well-known founder.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rice, a San Francisco-based executive director with Landor
Associates, a brand identity consulting firm, points to Walt Disney
Co. as an example of a corporation that successfully harnessed the
image of its founder.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt Disney was a dominant part of everything Disney was about,"
Rice said. "The company acknowledges his role and pays homage, but
[the company] has evolved in a way that's entirely appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Wendy's rose 84 cents to $31.03 on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers Hitch Wagons to Booming Truck Market</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The big American auto makers all unveiled brand-new or completely
redone trucks in the last week to cash in further on the high-profit
truck market, which is growing even as the overall U.S. market
shrinks.</LD>
<LD>   Ford Motor Co.'s new Expedition and Lincoln Navigator
sport-utility vehicles, General Motors Corp.'s Hummer H2 SUV and the
super-performance Dodge SRT-10 pickup truck from DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler Group all are designed to tap into America's growing love
affair with trucks, big and small.</LD>
<LD>   But the American brands are not alone.</LD>
<TE>   This week at Detroit's annual North American International Auto
Show, Lexus pulled the wraps off its GX470, Honda Motor Co.
introduced the Pilot, Mercedes revealed the GST, Volvo showed off its
new XC90, and Land Rover presented the new Range Rover. All are SUVs
set to hit the U.S. market this year or early in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   And all of them join an ever-increasingly crowded truck market
jostling for consumers' dollars. "The truck segment is growing in
part because it is the segment the imports are just starting to
develop products for," said Wes Brown, an analyst with Nextrend, a
Thousand Oaks auto-market research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Ford hopes the 2003 Expedition, with its sliding second-row seats
and one-touch power fold-down rear seats, will revive Ford's
lackluster truck sales, which have lost considerable ground in the
last few years. Expedition sales fell 16.6% in 2001, relinquishing
the crown of best-selling full-size SUV to the Chevy Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   "The Expedition is a very important product; dealers are counting
on it," said James Padilla, Ford's head of North America. "Trucks are
60% of Ford's total volume, so it's very significant. I think with
the product content and quality we've added, we'll be right in
there."</TE>
<TE>   Light trucks--pickups, SUVs and minivans--outsold passenger cars
for the first time in the U.S. last year, accounting for 51% of the
market, and SUVs have been the fastest-growing segment.</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers, the generation with the wealth to afford
increasingly expensive luxury SUVs and pickups, are getting older and
"more appreciative of the extra room and comfort" that a truck can
provide, said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Inc., an auto
industry consulting firm in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   And imports are muscling in on truck territory with full force.
Toyota Motor Co. matches the Big Three in every truck category and
then some, with full-size and compact pickups, five Toyota-brand SUVs
including two built on passenger-car platforms, and as of this week,
three Lexus SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's truck factory in Indiana churns out full-size Tundra
pickups and Sequoia SUVs. Nissan has broken ground for a plant in
Mississippi to build similar trucks, and Honda is finishing a plant
in Alabama to build minivans and another undisclosed truck product.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles such as the Tundra and SUVs such as BMW's X5 and Nissan's
"no-frills" Xterra have provided alternatives to passenger cars and
relief from the ordinariness of pickup trucks such as the Ford
F-Series and Chevy Silverado, or Jeep Cherokee in every other garage,
Nextrend's Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Lexus on Sunday introduced the GX470, a step above its popular
RX300.</TE>
<TE>   "Lexus, being part of Toyota, never lets up with new products,"
said Tom Libby, director of industry analysis with J.D. Power &amp;
Associates in Detroit. "If you look at the lineup of Lincoln and
Cadillac, they aren't even in the ballgame. Their SUVs are
warmed-over domestic trucks, and they're enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Lexus was the top luxury brand in the U.S. in 2001 for the second
consecutive year, and with both its cars and trucks, wins high marks
for thoughtful, on-the-mark products.</TE>
<TE>   "They've figured out what U.S. consumers want," said David
Bradley, auto industry analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York. "If
there's one thing you have to give them credit for, it's market
research."</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's safe-and-sane car maker, Volvo, has taken some by
surprise and entered the truck wars with its first SUV, the XC90. It
will be positioned as a full-size luxury sport-utility to compete
with the likes of Acura's MDX, the Lexus RX300 and the six-cylinder
versions of the Mercedes-Benz ML and BMW X5.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo's decision to build an SUV was driven by necessity. No car
company that wants to increase its U.S. sales appreciably can be
without one these days, said XC90 project director Hans Wikman.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Hyundai recently entered the fray, and Volkswagen and even
Porsche are planning SUVs, and Saab is developing a "crossover"
vehicle with SUV-like characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect 70% of our buyers to be conquests from other brands,"
said Peter Horbury, Volvo's chief designer who headed the XC90 design
team.</TE>
<TE>   The rest will be Volvo customers who have been waiting for an SUV
or who left the brand for a competitor in order to get an SUV but
would come back to Volvo if it had one, Volvo executives say.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the [manufacturing] capacity to expand to 200,000 cars a
year in the U.S. and 600,000 worldwide, but we cannot do that without
a car like this," Wikman said of the new SUV during a recent
interview at Volvo's North American headquarters in Irvine. Volvo
sold 125,673 of its cars and station wagons in the U.S. last year.</TE>
<TE>   Though Volvo initially expects to sell 50,000 XC90s worldwide,
almost 35,000 will be allocated for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors entered the so-called brute-ute wars last week with
the unveiling at the L.A. show of the production model H2
sport-utility, baby brother to the gigantic Hummer SUV adapted from
the military's Humvee personnel carrier and popularized by actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 Hummer H2, shorter and narrower than its big brother but
still one of the largest SUVs on the market, is expected to go
head-to-head with the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, or Galaendenwagen,
another boxy behemoth originally sold as a military vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   A Hummer SUT, or sport-utility truck built on the H2 chassis but
with an open bed in back, is scheduled to follow in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The British SUV brand Land Rover, which like Volvo is owned by
Ford, is trying to overcome an image of quality problems with the
completely redesigned $70,000, 282-hp Range Rover.</TE>
<TE>   Honda has high hopes for its Pilot, the scaled-down version of the
Acura MDX which has won rave reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilot seats eight passengers and will share the MDX's
3.5-liter V6 engine but sell for a much more accessible price,
between $25,000 and $30,000.</TE>

<LD>Sanya Thammasak, 94, a legal scholar who served briefly as Thailand's
prime minister in the 1970s after bloody protests toppled a military
regime, died Sunday in a Bankok hospital of complications from
internal bleeding.</LD>
<LD>   After student-led demonstrations overthrew military rulers in
October 1973, King Bhumibol Adulyadej named Sanya, former chief
justice of the Thailand Supreme Court, interim prime minister to lead
a transition to democracy. During his 15 months in office, Sanya
accelerated efforts to normalize ties with China and other communist
nations, sought to reduce U.S. military presence in Thailand as the
Vietnam War ended and improved relations with Hanoi.</LD>
<LD>   In October 1976, the military assumed control in another bloody
coup, indicating the military still had a firm grip on Thai politics.
Civilian rule took root in Thailand in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   Sanya was president of the Privy Council for more than 20 years
and president of the World Buddhism Organization.</TE>

<LD>Ray Patterson, 90, an animator whose seven-decade career included
contributing to four Oscar-winning Tom and Jerry shorts at MGM and
bringing Marvel Comics superheroes to television, died Dec. 30 of
natural causes at his Encino home after a lengthy illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Hollywood, Patterson began his career as a teenager in

<HD>Slayings Rise in City for 2nd Year</HD>
<DH>Crime: LAPD statistics for 2001 show 6% increase in homicides over
previous year.</DH>

<LD>The city of Los Angeles experienced a second year of increases in
homicides, as well as jumps in other categories of violent and property
crimes, according to 2001 statistics released Tuesday by the Los Angeles
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Figures showed that 584 people were killed citywide over the past
year, an increase of about 6% from 2000, when 551 people were slain, and
about 37% above the 1999 level.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's total was half the record high of 1,096, set in 1992.
Killings then fell steadily until hitting a 30-year low of 425 in 1999,
according to Robbery-Homicide Division statistics.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the kind of violence that we saw emerging in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, involving street narcotics and sales coupled with gang
activity," said LAPD Capt. Jim Tatreau of the Robbery-Homicide Division.
"It also portends a significant challenge [for the city] to avoid
returning to the level of violence we had a decade ago."</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau noted some familiar patterns: Most of the killings occurred in
the city's urban core. The area represents less than half of Los Angeles'
3.7 million population, but it experienced nearly three-quarters of the
homicides.</TE>
<TE>   Of the LAPD's 18 divisions, the top four for homicides--Southwest,
Southeast, 77th Street and Rampart--together accounted for 266 killings,
or about 45% of the citywide total.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the four divisions with the lowest murder rates--Central
(downtown), West Los Angeles, West Valley and Van Nuys--had a combined 54
deaths, or roughly 9% of the citywide total.</TE>
<TE>   As in past years, victims were disproportionately male--Latino or
African American--and in their late teens and early 20s. Most of the
homicides were tied to drugs and gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere was the problem more acute than in LAPD's 77th Street
Division, which according to official statistics had 82 killings in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Several 77th Street detectives, who declined to be identified,
attributed the rise in killings to a lack of resources and more
important, constraints on proactive policing.</TE>
<TE>   "Police want to do their jobs and do the right thing. But from our
perspective, we are spending more resources on investigating ourselves
than keeping the community safe," said one 77th Street detective,
referring to more aggressive investigations of alleged officer misconduct
in the wake of the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Other areas of the city also had to contend with rising murder rates.
In the San Fernando Valley, the Foothill Division murder rate spiked 60%
to 35 killings because of gang-related slayings and several multiple
homicides.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill Det. Frank Bishop lamented deep cuts to the Community Law
Enforcement and Recovery Program, a Los Angeles County program that had
financed aggressive anti-gang efforts since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a huge increase [in gang killings] and it's something that
the department, the bureau, the division are aggressively trying to
address," Bishop said. "Can we eradicate gang activity? No. But it's not
a secret that throwing more bodies at the problem will lessen the
impact."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA historian Eric Monkonnen, who is compiling a history of homicides
in Los Angeles, said police have to work harder on community relations
and stopping easily identifiable criminals--such as armed
parolees--before they kill.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the solution is going to be allocation of resources,"
Monkonnen said. "But maybe they need to concentrate much more in the
areas where the worst crime, homicide, is the worst."</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, there was a 7% year-over-year rise in serious crimes,
which include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault-domestic
violence. One exception was the number of reported rapes, which fell by
4.5% in 2001, although they remained up 5.4% over a two-year span.</TE>
<TE>   Property crimes also increased. Auto thefts led the way with a 7%
jump, followed by burglary, up 5%, and larcenies, up 4%.</TE>

<HD>Faith Turns to Anger for Latino Victims</HD>
<DH>Crime: An alleged scam combining evangelism with promises of new
homes and cars to its working-class targets is broken up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jovita Marquez and Virginia Villa were among the thousands of
Southern California Latinos drawn to La Luz de Oro Corp., whose name
means "The Light of Gold."</LD>
<LD>   At the company's festive sales rallies--marathon sessions mixing
evangelism with secular promises of money, cars and homes--the two women
were told they could realize their financial dreams if they invested in
the telecommunications company, followed its rules and held on to their
faith.</LD>
<LD>   But faith has given way to anger. Marquez and Villa, two friends from
the Inland Empire, recently drove a borrowed Honda Civic to the company's
Panorama City offices to find out what happened to the thousands of
dollars they invested. La Luz de Oro's doors were locked.</LD>
<TE>   "We thought we were going to get some help," said Marquez, 42, an
unemployed single mother. "But they robbed us."</TE>
<TE>   La Luz de Oro leaders say they run a legitimate business, selling
cellular phones and long-distance service. Members, who pay $75 to join,
are required to attend meetings and purchase phone cards. They are told
they can share in the profits of the phone services and qualify for free
cars and homes if they persuade others to join.</TE>
<TE>   In full-page ads in Spanish-language newspapers, the company said it
has given away 22 houses and many new cars.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators in the Los Angeles Police Department's financial
crimes division say those claims are false.</TE>
<TE>   La Luz de Oro, according to police and an indictment by a Los Angeles
County grand jury, is a pyramid scheme that has defrauded its mostly
Spanish-speaking members of their meager savings and ruined their credit.
The company, according to authorities, spread the financial ruin through
members who signed up friends and family to meet quotas and qualify for
prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Company President Mercedes Navarrete and eight others--including her
husband, Felix Navarrete, 70, and a daughter, Joan Frederick--pleaded not
guilty Friday to 28 counts in a grand jury indictment. The charges
include conspiracy, forgery, securities and tax fraud, and running "an
endless chain scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Also charged were Pedro Miramontes, 51; Rolando Soza, 46; Joe Garcia,
44; and Alejandra Nunez, 39.</TE>
<TE>   The Navarretes remain in County Jail in lieu of $1-million bail. Four
of the other seven defendants have been released. A trial date is set for
March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes Navarrete's attorney, Jeffrey Sklan, said his client is
innocent. Any dispute with disgruntled members, he said, should be
decided in civil court.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators in April seized $1.9 million, the bulk of the company's
assets. Navarrete's son, Carlos Frederick, said the prosecution is the
reason the company can't make good on its promises.</TE>
<TE>   "How can a company operate when all the money's frozen?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Luz de Oro members have filed more than 700 complaints with police and
new complaints from the company's 6,000 members arrive daily, according
to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Luz is a typical pyramid scheme, where members
profit from the payments of others who join later. The scheme requires a
never-ending supply of new members--an impossibility--and most
participants end up losers.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the losses are small compared with some scams, but it is
one of the worst to target Latinos in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big deal, because the victims are all working-class," said
LAPD Det. John Rodriguez, the lead investigator. "And what really seems
wrong is that they believed in the organization so much that they
invested not only for themselves. They also got their families involved."</TE>
<TE>   Even with its leadership facing trial, a recent Luz de Oro meeting at
a Montebello seafood restaurant drew nearly 100 members. Each paid a
mandatory $5 cover charge to hear the company's Spanish-language pitch,
punctuated by sing-alongs with Ricky Martin tunes and the company's own
perky anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos are workers," motivational speaker Sandra Garcia told the
crowd, pacing in front of young parents, retirees and men in cowboy hats.
"And that's why we'll maintain our organization! Our organization is
strong!"</TE>
<TE>   Margarita Turner, 70 and a widow, was among the believers. Turner has
given the company hundreds of dollars. She said she wasn't worried that
she has not seen any proceeds from the company's profit-sharing plan.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't helped me yet, but they've helped a lot of people,"
Turner said. "I know they are innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Det. Rodriguez said the company's remaining followers have been warned
of the charges through coverage in the Spanish-language media. "If they
haven't gotten the picture by now," he said, "they deserve to be taken."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two years, the company's message was delivered persuasively
by its president, 54-year-old Mercedes Navarrete, an attractive,
charismatic woman. She described how members could earn riches for
themselves and their friends and family if they persisted in finding new
people to join.</TE>
<TE>Potent Mix of Motivations</TE>
<TE>   The Luz de Oro pitch, investigators said, was expertly concocted by
Navarrete to play on the aspirations of her target audience, some of whom
continue to find it irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   It was a message combining racial pride, self-sufficiency, family
values, Christian piety and the American Dream.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd always talk about how concerned she was about families," said
Delia Putzeys, 42, a former Luz de Oro member. "She talked about
education, family ties, retirement plans, health plans--everything a
human being was interested in. She had a program for each."</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete was born in Mexico and has lived most of her life in
California, according to family members. Neighbors said security guards
have been posted at her modest stucco cottage in Arleta for months.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, authorities said, they have been unable to
prosecute Navarrete because her alleged victims were reluctant to file
formal complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "All these people seemed more concerned that if the police got
involved, they were all going to lose their money," said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Det. Gene Burns, who opened a file on Navarrete in 1999.
"It was virtually impossible to convince them they were going to lose
their money anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Insurance learned of Navarrete in the late
1990s, when she and two partners operated a Downey-based company called
La Luz Del Mundo. The department issued a cease-and-desist order against
that company in 1999 for selling fraudulent auto liability insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The "insurer" turned out to be a mail drop in Las Vegas, according to
Insurance Department investigators.</TE>
<TE>   One of Navarrete's partners, Alejandro Corral, was found guilty of
theft and acting as an unauthorized insurer in March 2000. Investigators
said Navarrete did not act as an agent, so she was not charged.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1999, Navarrete was caught in a videotaped sting
selling pyramid scheme memberships to Michigan state police
investigators. She spent 145 days in jail, pleading no contest to a
misdemeanor larceny charge.</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete was back in California in 2000, police said, recruiting
people to La Luz de Oro.</TE>
<TE>   Members were told they would receive $250,000 toward a new home from
La Luz de Oro if they gave the company at least $2,400 and signed up at
least seven new members, according to investigators and company
literature.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Rodriguez said that only one house was ever given away, and
that was to Nunez--one of the company leaders charged.</TE>
<TE>   The "dream car" program required a smaller investment and took in more
than 300 members.</TE>
<TE>   Potential members were told that the company would make the payments
on new vehicles if they paid at least $2,000 to La Luz de Oro and signed
up seven new members at $75 each, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Members bought the cars--usually new Mitsubishi Monteros--on credit
for no money down, police said. The income and employment history of many
of the applicants were exaggerated to help secure the loans, police said.</TE>
<TE>   When finance companies sent the first payment notices, police said,
few members could afford them. So far, 150 cars have been repossessed,
LAPD Det. Gene Arreola said.</TE>
<TE>2 Car Salesmen Among Those Indicted</TE>
<TE>   Two salesmen at the dealerships selling the most cars--Carlos Vargas
of Miller Mitsubishi in Van Nuys and Juan Alvarado of Assael Mitsubishi
in Duarte--are among the eight people facing charges in the grand jury
indictment, Arreola said.</TE>
<TE>   Managers at the two dealerships had no comment or did not return phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   The ripple effects of the car program are illustrated by Putzeys, who
for months has been making $900 payments on the Montero she keeps parked
in the back of her small paralegal service. Putzeys, who was told about
La Luz de Oro by her hairdresser, persuaded 14 friends and business
associates to join so she could become eligible for a car.</TE>
<TE>   Like many participants, she needed a co-signer on her car loan. Now
she is struggling to keep up the payments so she can preserve the credit
of her friend and loan co-signer, Paul Sussman, an elderly Van Nuys
bookkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   Putzeys said she is ashamed of having led others to the company. One
of them was Dolores Vasquez, 75, of Reseda, who is raising three
grandchildren on her Social Security check.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said she lost $1,500 to La Luz de Oro and persuaded about 30
East L.A. family members to join.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel worse for them than I do for myself," Vasquez said.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Wiretap Plan Smells a Lot Like Reelection Insurance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, we can all breathe a sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis, in a sure-fire plan to keep Al Qaeda terrorists at
bay in California, is going to make it easier for every podunk police
department to snoop into e-mail files and listen in on phone calls.</LD>
<LD>   Barney Fife takes out Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<TE>   That's the legislation Davis is pushing up the hill, anyway. And I
don't know about you, but I haven't felt this secure since Davis bravely
stepped in front of TV cameras and warned us about unspecified threats
against unspecified bridges at unspecified times.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of discussion, let's say Al Qaeda forces are using Rancho
Cucamonga as a staging center. Under the Davis model, which borrows if
not steals from the federal Patriot Act signed by President Bush after
Sept. 11, Cucamonga cops would theoretically bust up that cell before you
could say, "Praise be to Allah."</TE>
<TE>   That's because the police, using roving wiretaps and e-mail snooping
technology, would know the suspects' every thought.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects of this surveillance may not even have to be terrorists.
The legislation is still in the works, but it's possible that you or I,
if we were merely suspected of any kind of crime, could get the same
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley appeared to be eagerly
seconding Davis' motion, which of course is completely unnecessary. The
LAPD has for decades pioneered techniques that go far beyond those used
by any other police force or standing army.</TE>
<TE>   (It's not yet clear whether you could be held indefinitely, without
being charged, under the Davis plan. But if the governor's favorability
ratings drop in his coming reelection campaign, thumbscrews and firing
squads are possibilities, depending on how they poll).</TE>
<TE>   Some critics are calling this another surrender of civil liberties,
and others are wondering if we wouldn't be better off leaving terrorism
to the FBI rather than the likes of Rancho Cucamonga police (no
disrespect intended).</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky was in Sacramento on Tuesday,
telling the Assembly Judiciary Committee it would be a big mistake to
copy a federal Patriot Act that was instituted without a single
congressional hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Roving wiretaps, he said, constitute "a substantial intrusion on
privacy. . . . If there were a roving wiretap against Erwin Chemerinsky,
they could tap every phone in the building where I work. I'm boring, but
still, I have conversations I wouldn't want others listening to."</TE>
<TE>   Don't we all.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this even necessary?" Chemerinsky asks. "You can't do roving
wiretaps until you've got probable cause, and once you're there, that's
the point at which I would hope the FBI would be involved."</TE>
<TE>   What we need to keep in mind, of course, is that Gov. Davis is running
for reelection. If it made political sense to put a fence around Marin
County until we're certain there are no more American Taliban hiding in
the redwoods, Davis would be on television with the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   It's not important that the wiretap legislation make any sense or have
any chance of passage. Davis is in a fight to save his career, and he
would much rather be pitching unnecessary law-and-order proposals than
discussing, say, energy, education or the state's plummeting fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the governor's first steps in using his
strong-on-crime record as a selling point," says USC political science
teacher Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "Every candidate wants to be Rudy Giuliani
right now. Tough, protective and concerned about citizen safety."</TE>
<TE>   We all know that in an election year, Democrats try desperately to
look more Republican, and Republicans do their best impressions of
Democrats. (Dick Riordan's great advantage is that he doesn't even have
to fake it. The guy can't figure out what he is).</TE>
<TE>   Certainly you'll recall candidate Bush and his campaign to reinvent
the GOP as the sensitive, hands-across-America party of inclusion. At one
point during the convention in Philadelphia, the stage looked like the
set of "In Living Color."</TE>
<TE>   Then, once elected, Bush appointed a right-wing attorney general who
had helped submarine a black judicial candidate, considers dancing a sin
and gives thumbs up to tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   But let's get back to Davis, the human ATM machine who raised $1
million a month for three years, thinking a pile of cash would make him
untouchable. And now, through a combination of bad luck and worse
decisions, he finds himself sinking.</TE>

<HD>Crackdown Halts Bike Officers' Training on Dirt Trails in City
Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prodded by citizen complaints, city officials have informed the Los
Angeles Police Department's bike unit that it is not above the
law--specifically a long-standing ordinance banning bikes from hiking
paths.</LD>
<LD>   The result? LAPD officers can no longer train on dirt paths in Elysian
and Griffith parks, where the department for decades has sent bicycle
officers to learn how to navigate tough terrain.</LD>
<LD>   City officers aren't the only ones affected. The small bike patrol
affiliated with the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department also has
been forced to stop training--on the very grounds its officers are
responsible for patrolling.</LD>
<TE>   The ban threatens to reignite a smoldering feud over the use of bikes
on mountain trails that first flared in 2000. A proposal to open the
paths to cyclists touched off conflicts with hikers and equestrians, who
said they feared trail damage, erosion and collisions with two-wheeling
daredevils.</TE>
<TE>   Some bikers even reported physical threats. The mounting tension
caused the city to back off on its plan to open the trails to
bicycles--making Los Angeles city parks among the few areas in the county
where trails are off-limits to bikers.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to head off a repeat of that squabble, the sudden ban on police
training has politicians and park advocates gingerly considering a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, LAPD bike trainers and the park rangers who work out with
them may be forced into an alternate training locale, possibly in
Burbank. (In a strange irony, the rangers are permitted to ride on park
trails while performing their official duties, but not while training for
their work.)</TE>
<TE>   "We've just really got no idea right now where we are going to get the
training in," said Sgt. Vance Bjorklund, the bicycle unit's lead trainer,
who hasn't been able to hold a class since October. "One thing we do
know: Unless they change the law, there's no place to train off-road in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Police cyclists have trained since the early 1980s on the dirt fire
roads of Elysian Park, near the Police Academy and Dodger Stadium. They
also trained on nearby trails in 4,000-acre Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   They'd probably still be taking instruction in both parks if not for
Christine Peters, a Hollywood costume designer who lives on the eastern
slope of Elysian Park, just yards from a steep dirt trail.</TE>
<TE>An Alarming Example</TE>
<TE>   Peters was alarmed four months ago when her boyfriend saw a group of
LAPD officers training on the trail. The trainees, Peters said, tore down
the precipitous hill at high speeds. One flew off his bike, and
paramedics had to be called.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy was being yelled at by his superior to go fast," said
Peters, a member of a group of park advocates commissioned by the city
two years ago to study the bike issue. "He was being told to virtually
kill himself. That's not exactly what we want to see up here. It's not
safe for them, and it's not safe for people walking here."</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the bicycle ban from her earlier advocacy work, Peters
promptly e-mailed the head of the Citizens Committee to Save Elysian
Park. He informed LAPD officials, who took the matter to the city
attorney and the Recreation and Parks Department. The department
determined that police were violating the ban on trail riding. Soon
after, the LAPD's bike unit was forced to suspend training in both parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, there was no training," Bjorklund said. About nine times a
year, Bjorklund directs small, weeklong riding classes.</TE>
<TE>   The sergeant said the training can get pretty rough. Officers
occasionally take serious spills, and there have been a few broken bones
and concussions. Trainees even wear bulletproof jackets for added
protection against accidents. Still, Bjorklund said, an element of danger
is a necessary part of rigorous police training.</TE>
<TE>   The bike patrol does most of its training on paved streets, the kind
its officers usually work. But California police training standards call
for all officers to prepare for occasional forays onto dirt and hilly
terrain. To meet that requirement, each trainee spends about three hours
on mountainous dirt paths.</TE>
<TE>   "We train there just in case our officers do have to go onto dirt
surfaces, with all the trails and ruts," said Bjorklund, who argues that
police should be exempt from the trail-riding ban. "After all, we are
there to protect people."</TE>
<TE>   With just those sentiments in mind, Griffith Park-area City Councilman
Tom LaBonge and other city leaders are seeking a compromise. LaBonge
broached the subject of amending the law at a recent neighborhood
meeting, only to find stiff resistance.</TE>
<TE>Hoping for a Compromise</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, keeping the police from training was not the intent when
the ordinance was come up with. That's just ridiculous," said LaBonge
aide Erik Sanjurjo.</TE>
<TE>   But some park advocates worry that allowing police on the trails will
open the floodgates, eventually giving all mountain bikers full access.</TE>
<TE>   "There are already lots of people riding illegally, and we don't see
the police doing much about that," said Peters, speaking as a man rode
his mountain bike up a dirt path behind her and into the hills of Elysian
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Peters has perhaps her strongest ally in City Councilman Ed Reyes,
whose district encompasses Elysian Park.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that he is in the difficult position of trying to
support law enforcement while making park users happy, Reyes has made it
clear that he is in no mood to budge--not even for police.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I don't see opening up the trails for bikes," the
councilman said. "There are other park areas where the police can train.
They can go somewhere else."</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Man Sentenced to 65 Years to Life in Rape Attempt</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge rejects defense motions for a new trial and tells
Terry Stephenson that his two sons 'deserve the truth' about the attack
on the school nutritionist.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County judge sentenced a three-time felon to 65 years to
life in prison Tuesday for an attempted rape, then scolded the defendant
before his weeping children for letting them believe he was innocent.</LD>
<LD>   "You have thrown your life away," Superior Court Judge James P.
Cloninger told defendant Terry Stephenson of Santa Paula. "But you have a
decision about whether to throw their lives away as well."</LD>
<LD>   Stephenson, a 37-year-old soda company deliveryman, was convicted in
June of carjacking, kidnapping, deadly assault and assault with intent to
commit rape.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a defense of mistaken identity, a jury concluded Stephenson
abducted a Ventura middle school nutritionist on the morning of Jan. 7,
2000, as she walked from her pickup truck to her office.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, he dragged the 52-year-old woman to her
truck, drove five miles to a church parking lot and ordered her to remove
her clothes.</TE>
<TE>   When she refused and fought him off, eventually falling out of the
truck while screaming for help, Stephenson beat and kicked her in the
face before running off.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe you intended for her to leave the parking lot alive,"
Cloninger said during Tuesday's sentencing hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Cloninger declined to strike Stephenson's three prior felony
convictions that mandated a 25-year-to-life sentence under the state's
three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   He added 27 years for the carjacking, 10 years for two of the prior
convictions and three years for causing serious injury to the victim.</TE>
<TE>   After explaining the sentence, Cloninger held up two letters from
Stephenson's teenage sons.</TE>
<TE>   He remarked that the boys clearly loved their father and believed he
was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking "as a father and a man," the judge urged Stephenson to admit
his crimes to his children so they don't grow up believing he was treated
unfairly by the criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been misled," the judge said, as Stephenson wept at the
counsel table. "And they deserve the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Cloninger's remarks brought a dramatic end to a three-hour hearing in
which defense attorneys pushed hard for a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Michael Plaut, who recently took over the case, argued that
there was no evidence to suggest Stephenson intended to rape the victim.
He also raised allegations of jury misconduct, ineffective lawyering by a
previous attorney and improper police tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson was arrested a few days after the attack. His wife's car
was found across the street from the school, and the victim identified
him from a photo lineup.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, she testified that she got a good look at his face and
recognized him as the deliveryman who often stood by her desk eating from
a candy jar while she signed the delivery papers.</TE>
<TE>   Plaut argued that Stephenson's trial lawyer should have pushed harder
to challenge that identification.</TE>
<TE>   But Cloninger denied the defense motion, finding there was nothing to
suggest Stephenson had received an unfair trial.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also sought to strike Stephenson's prior convictions,
which would have significantly reduced his prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson was convicted of commercial robbery in 1982 and two bank
robberies in 1986. Plaut argued that his client had struggled with
alcohol and drug abuse during that time but has since turned his life
around.</TE>
<TE>   But Cloninger refused to disregard the prior felonies, stating: "The
three-strikes law was made for people like the defendant."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. William Karr said that the victim, who was not in
court Tuesday, was frustrated by the delay in sentencing caused by
Stephenson's change of attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Karr said she continues to struggle emotionally and physically. Her
nose was broken and several teeth were chipped. Her fractured jaw was
wired shut. And she still suffers from headaches, she told jurors at
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been very difficult for her," Karr said. "It will affect her
for the rest of her life."</TE>

<HD>State Stops Using Public Money to Buy Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>In what state officials called a "significant milestone" for
California's year-old electricity crisis, power costs have fallen to the
point that no public money was needed in November and December to pay for
the electricity the state purchased on behalf of utility customers.</LD>
<LD>   After spending more than $6 billion of taxpayer money in the last year
to keep electricity flowing to customers of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the state has
begun covering its power purchases with just the money it collects from
utility customers.</LD>
<LD>   "Now what we're seeing is the trend of a positive cash flow," said
California Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. His
agency was shoved into the business of buying about 30% of the power the
utilities needed in January 2001, after months of high wholesale
electricity prices drained the utilities of cash.</LD>
<TE>   But utility customers shouldn't look for a rate cut any time soon.
Whatever money the water department collects beyond what is needed to buy
electricity will be used to whittle away at the state's mountain of debt.</TE>
<TE>   And the trend of the department collecting more money than it spends
will definitely reverse itself in April. That's when the state must begin
making monthly payments of more than $130 million on a $4.3-billion
short-term loan it floated in July to help cover electricity purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Still unresolved, too, is how the state will replace the $6.1 billion
it spent from the general fund on power. A plan to issue bonds, to be
paid back by utility customers, is mired in politics. But the turning
point in the water department's finances comes a year earlier than Gov.
Gray Davis' energy advisors forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor planned for the worst and hoped for the best," said
Joseph S. Fichera, chief executive of Saber Partners, a Wall Street firm
that helped Davis draft a plan to control energy costs and avoid
blackouts. The plan hinged on three elements--signing long-term power
contracts at prices lower than on the spot market, rapid construction of
power plants and heavy conservation by consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Big risks remain, Fichera said. They include what happens in January
2003, when the water department by law must get out of the power-buying
business, even if Edison and PG&amp;E have not recovered enough financially
to resume buying electricity for their customers. Another risk, he said,
is whether power plants get built at the pace that state energy planners
assume. "It's not over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The water department's overall power costs have plunged from a monthly
high of $2 billion in May to $373 million in December. Factors cited by
experts include a drop in natural gas prices, a price cap imposed by
federal regulators and the effect of the state's long-term power deals.
Also the Public Utilities Commission has raised utility rates an average
of 30% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Newport Cheerleaders Told Original Picks Will Stand</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Complaints about Newport Harbor tryouts had prompted
decision to accept all 48 applicants, but judges' 30 selections are
reaffirmed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Harbor High School officials announced Tuesday that they
have finally decided which girls deserve a spot on the cheerleading
squad: Only those who were picked by a panel of judges six weeks ago will
be guaranteed a set of pom-poms and a sweater.</LD>
<LD>   The question of who should be on the team has been the subject of an
increasingly bitter fight among girls and their parents since some
complained of inconsistencies in judging after the Nov. 29 tryouts.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the dispute, Principal Michael Vossen attempted to resolve
matters by allowing all 48 girls who had tried out to be on the squad.
But on Tuesday, as many would-be cheerleaders dissolved into tears,
Vossen said he was going with the original squad of 30 but would soon
hold additional tryouts for four more spots.</LD>
<TE>   Practices, which had been suspended pending the outcome of the fight,
will resume today.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision is the only fair one they could have come up with,"
said Michael Johnston, the father of two cheerleaders who made the
original squad. Johnston filed a formal complaint with the district
protesting the principal's first solution of putting all the girls on the
team.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that all the girls and their parents agreed in writing
before the tryouts to abide by the judges' decision.</TE>
<TE>   Other parents and cheerleaders disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not right," said Megan Romenello, who did not make the original
squad. Megan said she quit her job when she got the happy news in early
December that she would be a cheerleader after all. And she said she will
not be trying out again.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't go through the process of not making it again," she said.
"They've crushed a lot of girls."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Castellanos, assistant superintendent of secondary education for
the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, acknowledged that the ups and
downs of the process have been painful for many girls.</TE>
<TE>   But if school officials had hoped Tuesday's decision would resolve a
dispute that has pitted friends against each other and ruined the
holidays for many families, they were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   One woman whose daughter made the original squad said she intends to
file a complaint with the school district today, protesting the way the
administration handled the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you see all these girls crying?" said Sherry Blake, gesturing
around her as red-eyed girls collapsed in each others' arms or were led
away by their mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Another mother, Annette Kerr, said some parents are considering a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the first time the composition of the cheerleading
squad at the coastal campus ended up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Since a 1994 lawsuit in which the district paid tens of thousands of
dollars, the high school has gone to great lengths to prevent controversy
over cheerleading tryouts. The judges are professionals from outside the
school district who don't know the girls. A certified public accountant
tabulates the scores, watched over by a representative from the League of
Women Voters.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, after the Nov. 29 tryouts, Lisa Callahan, cheerleading
coach for the last 13 years and a former Raiders cheerleader, was upset.
She said she had never previously complained about the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, who was in the room during tryouts but did not vote, said
that the judges' marks were "inconsistent." Girls who performed the
mandatory routine were scored lower than girls who smilingly improvised.
What's more, Callahan said, judges were talking to each other during the
tryouts.</TE>
<TE>Parents Unhappy With Previous Decisions</TE>
<TE>   Others, including the team's faculty advisor, Jennifer Cilderman, said
the tryouts were fair.</TE>
<TE>   The coach, who is paid by the booster club and is not a faculty
member, complained to administrators. When the mothers of girls who had
not made the cut found out about her concerns, they began complaining as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Vossen stepped in on Dec. 12 and said everyone could be on the team.
He sent out a letter promising to fix inconsistencies in the tryout
process next year and urging the girls to get along and have a great
season.</TE>
<TE>   But after parents of girls who had made the original team put up a
fuss, district officials formed a committee to investigate the tryouts.
It found the process had been fair and recommended reinstating the
original team and, as a compromise, adding four more spots.</TE>
<TE>   While this decision pleased some parents, others reacted as if it was
a bad call in the final seconds of a high school championship football
game. Some said the principal's actions were tantamount to child abuse.
Many refused to leave a Dec. 21 meeting with the principal until he
changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Vossen put the matter off until students returned from winter break.</TE>
<TE>   Now many girls said they hope they can just go on with the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheerleading has been my life since I was a freshman," said Savannah
Romero, who made the original squad but thinks all the girls should
remain on the team. "I'm glad to get back to it."</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Ask Judge to Clear Lopez</HD>
<DH>Crime: D.A.'s office says evidence casts doubts on whether an
Orange man imprisoned for two years committed a 1999 holdup. A judge will
rule on the motion Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors on Tuesday asked a judge to dismiss all
charges against a man who spent two years in prison for a robbery
officials now believe was probably committed by another man.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came amid mounting evidence that George Lopez had nothing
to do with the May 1999 robbery of an Anaheim loan office. Two of the
robbery victims said Lopez wasn't the gunman, and another man said he,
not Lopez, committed the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal would mark the fifth time in two years that the Orange
County district attorney's office has dropped charges against convicted
felons after new evidence surfaced. In 2000, a man who served 20 years in
prison for the murder of a fast-food manager was set free when witnesses
cast doubts on his guilt. Eight months later, prosecutors released
another man amid doubts he committed two robberies. And last year,
prosecutors struck down two other robbery convictions after follow-up
investigations found the suspects were innocent.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez's case, like the previous four, was based in large part on
witness identification testimony. He was arrested in August 1999 after
one victim of a robbery at Commercial Credit Corp. said he looked like
the man who robbed him.</TE>
<TE>   The jury that convicted Lopez in February 2000 never heard that two
other victims thought he was innocent, nor did they learn that another
man pleaded guilty to committing three nearly identical robberies the
same week. That man, Johnny SantaCruz, told The Times in July that he
committed the Anaheim robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation prompted a judge in September to free Lopez, an Orange
resident, while he decided whether to grant a new trial. After their own
investigation, prosecutors filed a motion Tuesday asking Judge Daniel
Didier to drop the case. Didier is scheduled to consider the motion
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian Gurwitz would not say what the district
attorney's investigation found but said he took the action "because the
newly discovered evidence has cast enough doubt on whether Lopez was the
gunman."</TE>
<TE>   " . . . The interests of justice are best served by vacating the
convictions," Gurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was running an errand when his wife called with the news
Tuesday. "I'm so happy, words can't even explain it," Lopez said. "I have
my life now. I'm so excited I feel like jumping up and screaming."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's appeals lawyer, James Crawford, said, "The system, it just
broke down. Everybody from the defense to the prosecution, nobody did
what they're supposed to do, before, during and after the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney should have dismissed the case once the
witnesses said George wasn't the gunman."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what role, if any, the dismissal of charges against Lopez
will have on the upcoming race for district attorney, which pits
incumbent Tony Rackauckas against prosecutor Wally Wade. So far, Wade has
not made an issue of the Lopez case or of the other recent incidents in
which convicted felons had their cases dropped.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Lopez spent the day helping his father sell a used car.
He's struggled to find a job since his release from prison, because
potential employers are turned off by a felony conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to go on with my life and forget about this thing and
pretend this never happened," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Lopez's wife and parents who pushed his case, both in the media
and by raising money to hire an appeals lawyer. Although the initial
courtroom losses were frustrating, his mother, Tricia Lopez, said she was
thrilled by the district attorney's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got chills," she said. "I have no words. It was worth the fight.
I tried so hard and no one would give me the time of day. I'm just happy
my son is free, maybe now he can get on with his life. It brings tears to
my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Sources in the district attorney's office said prosecutors agreed to
dismiss the case in part because SantaCruz recently admitted to
investigators that he committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   SantaCruz and Lopez were arrested together four days after the robbery
when police searched a car they were traveling in and discovered a gun.
But SantaCruz later told The Times in an interview that this was the
first time he had ever met Lopez and that Lopez didn't know the gun was
in the car. SantaCruz insisted that Lopez had no involvement in the
robberies.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do it. . . . He's innocent," SantaCruz said in the July
interview at Ironwood State Prison. "I saw an opportunity. I was going to
take their money."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities charged Lopez with armed robbery after one of the victims
at the loan office identified him in a photo.</TE>
<TE>   But during the trial, two of the victims told the prosecutor outside
of court that they didn't believe Lopez was the gunman. The prosecutor
passed along the statement to Lopez's defense lawyer, who chose not to
ask them to testify about their doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the outcome of the Lopez case underscores the
fragile nature of eyewitness identification testimony, which several
studies have shown to be a leading cause of wrongful convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Romney, a former Orange County deputy district attorney who now
is a professor at Western State University College of Law in Fullerton,
said recent publicity about wrongful convictions is making the justice
system more open to correcting its mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that more innocent people are being convicted, but rather
we're looking more closely at those cases," Romney said. "This is due in
large part to DNA evidence, which confirmed for prosecutors and defense
attorneys that these claims of innocence are more than sour grapes from a
convicted person."</TE>
<TE>   While the Lopez family prepared to celebrate Tuesday afternoon, Tricia
Lopez wondered whether her son and her family would ever recover.</TE>
<TE>   "They make a terrible mistake and then go on their merry way," she
said. "And I lose my son" for two years.</TE>
<TE>   George Lopez said he understands he's fortunate to be free.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I spend with my wife and son I cherish, " he said. "I could
get hit by a bus one day, or look at what happened to me, I got convicted
of something I didn't do."</TE>

<HD>But Will Angels Give Fans a Red October?</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Debuting today, the redesigned logo and uniforms are
intended to symbolize a new era for the team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anaheim Angels, who finished last season 41 games out of first
place, haven't made a statement on the field in a while, so marketing
experts have devised Plan B: the fashion statement.</LD>
<LD>   Today the team rolls out new uniforms, a new logo and a new
color--red.</LD>
<LD>   In a ceremony this morning at Edison International Field that will
include 800 sixth-graders and current and former players moonlighting as
models, the Angels plan to unveil their new look--the seventh incarnation
in the team's 41-year history.</LD>
<TE>   The "Big A" has been clipped of its wings, adopting instead the team's
old-time halo. Gone is the eight-color spectrum--which included a fierce
periwinkle--in favor of a clean, four-color scheme dominated by red.</TE>
<TE>   To further mark the new era, supervisors on Tuesday officially
proclaimed today "Red Dawn" day in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited about it," said Kevin Uhlich, vice president of sales,
marketing and operations for the Angels. "Red was a color that Gene Autry
absolutely loved."</TE>
<TE>   Autry, the Angels' founding owner and a savvy businessman, also knew
that sports is about more than games. A big part of any business is
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Some teams, such as the New York Yankees, have branded themselves as
winners. The Anaheim Angels haven't.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning is the best branding strategy," said Dean Bonham, chief
executive officer of the Bonham Group, a Denver-based sports and
entertainment marketing firm. "But with all due respect to the Angels,
when you don't have a winning tradition, perhaps you need to fall back on
the second-best branding strategy."</TE>
<TE>   The new uniform and logo have been in the works for at least 18
months, said Howard Smith, senior vice president of licensing for Major
League Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "You wait," Smith said. "The fans will be very excited about this
change."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' Disney-designed uniforms that debuted in 1997 were never
embraced by fans, Uhlich conceded. People didn't like the wings on the A.
They didn't like the pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   And periwinkle?</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to open a new chapter with the Angels," Uhlich said.
"I hope people won't be cynical about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning is the foundation for so many great things. Nothing will take
the place of winning. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be creative . . .
and offer new things to our fans."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Won't Fight Tax Ruling</HD>
<DH>Property: They will let O.C.'s assessor decide whether to appeal
case that means millions to cities, county, schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors Tuesday ducked what could become a
far-reaching legal battle by voting not to challenge a recent court
ruling that found a key method for assessing property unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they punted to independently elected Assessor Webster J.
Guillory, allowing him to hire his own attorneys for an appeal, with the
county paying the costs.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors also recommended that Guillory immediately stop using the
assessment method--called "recapturing"--because a Superior Court judge
ruled that it violates Proposition 13, the state's landmark 1978
tax-reform measure.</LD>
<TE>   The board also directed the assessor, tax collector and the
auditor/controller to notify anyone whose properties were assessed under
the method during the last four years that they might have overpaid their
taxes. State law allows taxpayers up to four years to file claims for
refunds.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer drafted the board's response to last month's
ruling by Judge John M. Watson. The vote was 4 to 1, with Supervisor
Chuck Smith dissenting because of the possible loss of tax money to
schools, cities and other governments.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys have defended recapturing, which allows the assessed
value on some properties to rise above the 2%-per-year limit set by
Proposition 13. County assessors statewide use the same method.</TE>
<TE>   "We've shifted this issue to where it should be, and that is with the
assessor," said Spitzer, who supports Watson's ruling. "This has become a
pattern and practice of assessors statewide. It's the assessor's
responsibility to defend it in court."</TE>
<TE>Guillory Says He Wants Clarification</TE>
<TE>   Guillory hasn't decided whether to appeal the ruling. He is
independently elected by voters and faces reelection in March. Watson's
ruling contradicts other provisions of law, Guillory said, and one way to
clarify things would be to let a higher court decide the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This [ruling] may personally be good for a lot of people," he said.
"I'm not against it, I just want to get some clarity. My role is to
promote accuracy and uniformity."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, which passed overwhelmingly, prohibited assessments
from rising more than 2% a year unless properties were sold. But
assessors statewide, including Guillory, routinely assess above that rate
the properties where values have slumped and then recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Watson ruled that Proposition 13 clearly provides for property values
to drop during bad economic times. But they cannot rise more than 2% a
year regardless of how much the real estate market springs back, he said.</TE>
<TE>   California taxpayers and government groups are closely watching the
Orange County case because it's the first ruling on the legality of
recapturing. Response has been divided over whether the case should be
appealed, which could lead to the assessment practice being declared
unconstitutional statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a pretty large risk," said Pat Leary, legislative
representative for the County Supervisors Assn. of California, which is
monitoring the case. "It's a risk, especially in these economic times.
But a lot of people think [the ruling] would be overturned on appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Tax attorney Rob Pool of Seal Beach, who filed the case, said the
board's actions Tuesday should be commended. He bought his $330,000 home
in 1995. Because of a drop in the real estate market, the house wasn't
reassessed for two years. Then, in 1998, its taxable value was set at
$343,200--a 4% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Pool said he'll push for Watson to expand the case into a class-action
lawsuit on behalf of every Orange County property owner whose assessments
rose above 2% a year since 1998. Watson indicated last month that he
would delay ruling on the class-action issue until after supervisors
decided whether to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner they come to grips with it, the better off they'll be,"
Pool said. "This issue isn't going to go away."</TE>
<TE>Impact on Government Would Be Substantial</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling is upheld, the impact on schools, cities and county
government could be substantial. Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom
has estimated that governments countywide would lose $147 million in
taxes in the first year. Of that, schools would lose the most--$94
million. The state, however, must make up the difference if schools dip
below a minimum level of funding.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling were applied retroactively, Orange County's taxing
agencies would have to refund an additional $285 million in excess
property taxes paid between 1998 and 2001, Sundstrom estimated.
Statewide, the loss could go as high as $4 billion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pool acknowledged that schools, cities and the county could be forced
to refund millions of dollars. The biggest hit would come in the first
year, then diminish as properties were sold.</TE>
<TE>   But naysayers warned of the same impending fiscal doom in 1978 when
Proposition 13 passed, Pool said. But it didn't happen, he said: In 1975,
the Los Angeles County property tax roll was $85 billion. For 2001-02,
the tax roll is $610 billion. Comparative figures for Orange County were
unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Assessor employee Larry L. Bales, who is challenging Guillory in
March, said the county's reliance on the recapturing method will become
an issue in his campaign. Supervisors facing reelection include board
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, Vice Chairman Tom Wilson and Jim Silva, who
all voted against lodging an appeal. Spitzer, reelected last year, is
running for the Assembly.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Valley Golf Project May Be Back on Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late Japanese media tycoon's dream of building an upscale golf
course in the Ojai Valley is being resurrected by a New York investment
group.</LD>
<LD>   However, environmental critics are just as upset about the revamped
plans for the Farmont Golf Course as they were during the six-year fight
before the original project was approved in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Promoters say the course, designed by high-profile golf architect Tom
Fazio, would draw enthusiasts from throughout California, complementing
the private course at the Ojai Valley Inn and the public course at Soule
Park.</LD>
<TE>   But the current owners of the 2,000 acres on which the 200-acre course
would be built, New York developer Intell Management &amp; Investment Corp.,
have a different vision for the course than the late Kagehisa Toyama had.</TE>
<TE>   His plan, approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, was for
a private club for Japanese businessmen, offering no more than 35 rounds
a day to an elite group. Intell wants a public course offering 130 rounds
a day.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Toyama pledged a 1,500-acre easement to the Ojai Valley Land
Conservancy; Intell has withdrawn that commitment and could subdivide the
unused acreage, selling parcels for about half a dozen high-priced
mini-ranches.</TE>
<TE>   In the environmentally conscious Ojai Valley, Toyama's proposal had
faced fierce opposition. The plan approved by supervisors had been scaled
back significantly from the version he first pitched in 1987. After a
permit was granted, the plan was delayed by two lawsuits, both of which
failed.</TE>
<TE>   Intell's expanded proposal has triggered concerns over everything from
traffic to water to trout.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't believe the Ojai Valley needs a third golf course,"
said Alasdair Coyne, president of Keep the Sespe Wild. "The end goal of
the environmental community is to see this entire area preserved as open
space, with no water use."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, environmentalists asked the Board of Supervisors to
require an environmental impact study based on the proposed changes, a
move that might stall the project for years.</TE>
<TE>   "I would urge you to seek a higher environmental review," said Russ
Baggerly, president of Environmental Coalition of Ventura County, which
had sued to stop the earlier project.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are not leaning in that direction. County planners have
instead recommended a limited review to supplement the environmental
impact report that supervisors signed off on nine years ago. The
supplement would focus on how increased use of the land might affect air
quality and traffic. It also would examine possible effects on the
Ventura River habitat of the steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   At Supervisor Steve Bennett's urging, however, supervisors agreed that
any additional study should examine how the changes would affect water
use and ground water levels.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors will take the matter up again at a meeting Jan. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay F. Nielson, the Ventura attorney who represented Toyama and
now represents Intell, characterized foes' criticisms as political.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the complaint was it's an elite golf course and it's going to
be very expensive to join," he said. "Now that it's a public course, the
argument is that it's going to invite too many people. These are really
straw-man issues."</TE>
<TE>   Nielson said developers would still be allowed to pump no more than
407 acre-feet per year of water from the upper Ventura River system, the
limit set in 1993. And he disagreed with claims that more foot traffic on
the course and the possibility of a handful of mini-ranches would
substantially increase the need for water.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to water it more because you have more people," he
said of the course, adding that low-flow toilets would be installed in
the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists countered that the county should not take developers
at their word and should do the extra study to assess effects
scientifically.</TE>
<TE>   Nielson also said that of all the projects possible on the 2,000
acres, the Intell golf course is one of the more environmentally
sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   If foes had let the 1993 plan proceed, they wouldn't be in this
situation now, he said. "The Ojai community overplayed its cards."</TE>

<HD>6 Private Campuses in Valley Face Eviction</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified indicates it won't renew leases. The
schools say they could lose students if new sites aren't found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Unified School District officials say they do not plan
to renew private schools' leases at six campuses in the western San
Fernando Valley, sending the schools scrambling to find new homes or risk
losing students because of the uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   Because the West Valley is one of the few areas in Los Angeles where
the school district does not anticipate needing more campuses, officials
at the private schools question the need for them to move. Land in the
West Valley is hard to find, they say, particularly to suit schools.</LD>
<LD>   The Woodland Hills schools poised to lose campuses over the next 17
months are Castlemont School, Kadima Hebrew Academy, Lewis Carroll
Academy of the Arts, Lycee International de Los Angeles and Rabbi Max D.
Raiskin West Valley Hebrew Academy. In West Hills, the West Valley
Christian Church and School rents two campuses.</LD>
<TE>   Collectively, the affected private schools enroll about 1,300
students. Another L.A. Unified campus, in Chatsworth, housed a Pinecrest
school before the lease expired last July.</TE>
<TE>Recommendation May Be Made Next Week</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified vacated the Valley campuses in the 1980s, said Kathi
Littmann, the district's deputy chief executive for new construction. The
former elementary schools are too far from central Los Angeles to receive
students bused from those overcrowded areas, officials said, and the
district's demographic projections indicate the campuses will not be
needed for 10 or 15 years--if ever.</TE>
<TE>   District staff members might make a recommendation for the campuses'
future as early as next week. The possibilities include selling the land
and using the proceeds to build schools in areas that badly need them,
said Littmann, adding that continuing to lease the Valley campuses is not
a moneymaker.</TE>
<TE>   "It barely covers the cost of having the schools sit there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Castlemont officials, for instance, do not want to move when the
school's 10-year lease ends in August. The campus of the former Collier
Street Elementary School is "located centrally for all of our parents,"
said Sheryl Hausman, Castlemont's financial vice president. Since moving
to the site in 1992, Castlemont has made improvements at its own expense,
adding an athletic field, computer lab and repaving, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nice area. The neighbors are great, and I think it benefits
everybody around," Hausman said.</TE>
<TE>   Since parents learned Castlemont could lose its 6 1/2-acre campus,
enrollment has dropped from its peak of 335 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's decreased because of the uncertainty," Hausman said, but she
would not say how many students did not return when classes began last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Castlemont is in "favorable negotiations" with L.A. Unified, Hausman
said, but she declined to elaborate. The for-profit elementary school has
offered to buy the campus, Littmann said, but because it is public land
the school would have to bid against any other suitors. Extending the
lease would also require bids, she said.</TE>
<TE>   West Valley Christian Church is close to buying land in West Hills for
its sanctuary and school, said Robert Lozano, administrator of the
400-student campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We've looked at probably over 100 sites in the last four years," he
said. "It's been a real arduous task."</TE>
<TE>   The church and school's two leases expire in June 2003, which provides
just enough time to make a move, Lozano said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have a place located at this point and looking good, it
definitely would have affected enrollment," he said.</TE>
<TE>Public Schools Have Room for the Students</TE>
<TE>   If any of the schools close, Littmann said there is room for their
students in the West Valley's public schools, which are among the
district's least crowded.</TE>
<TE>   But because many families chose the private schools for their
religious instruction and other programs not found in public schools,
Alan Shapiro, president of the West Valley Hebrew Academy, said he
doubted the families would accept the district's invitation to enroll.
Shapiro said his school owns land in the West Valley and hopes to move
there after its lease expires in 2003.</TE>

<HD>Woman With Sickle Cell Anemia Fights for Right to Grow Pot for
Medicinal Use</HD>
<DH>Trial: The marijuana grower's case will test Prop. 215, passed in
California in 1996.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, Somayah Kambui argued that she had a medical right to
use marijuana--a drug of choice for many like her who suffer from the
debilitating and painful disease sickle cell anemia.</LD>
<LD>   So the 51-year-old founder of a cannabis club, Crescent Alliance Self
Help for Sickle Cell, said she got a doctor's prescription and began
growing her personal stash of marijuana in her South Los Angeles
backyard.</LD>
<LD>   But police officers challenged Kambui's claim in October when they
raided her garden and confiscated, by their estimate, a stash that was
somewhat more than personal: 200 pounds of marijuana plants.</LD>
<TE>   "She had a farm back there," said Deputy Dist. Atty. John Kildebeck.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui was arrested, spent 60 days in jail awaiting trial and
now--because of two prior felony convictions--faces the possibility of
life in prison under the three-strikes law. The two previous convictions,
involving illegal-firearms possession and explosives, came in the 1970s
when she was active in the Black Panther Party.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the worst, she appeared Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court,
where prosecutor Kildebeck and Kambui's attorney both called for a delay
in the start of her trial.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Welbourn, Kambui's court-appointed attorney, told his client
she would be taking a chance if she went ahead with a trial so soon.
Kambui refused his advice and asked the judge for a speedy trial. He
complied, setting a Jan. 18 date.</TE>
<TE>   "Let things fall where they need to fall," Kambui said later.</TE>
<TE>   Her case is another test of Proposition 215, the medical-marijuana
initiative passed by California voters in 1996. The measure allowed
medical use of marijuana but did not set limits on how much could be
grown or consumed--a gray area that has surfaced in several criminal
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Last year federal agents shut down a West Hollywood cannabis club,
uprooting 400 plants, seizing indoor growing lights and hauling off
computers listing the names and medical histories of the center's
patients who allegedly used marijuana to ease the pain or help with
nausea caused by chemotherapy or AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   California is among a handful of states that legalized medical use of
marijuana, putting it in conflict with federal statutes that make pot
illegal for cultivation, sale and use. That dispute escalated this year
with a U.S Supreme Court ruling that upheld federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui said her use of marijuana eases the pain of sickle cell anemia,
a disease in which the blood cells become deformed when oxygen levels are
low, creating painful blockage of blood vessels and causing organ damage.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui said the marijuana grown in her backyard--on a block of
single-family homes and apartments near the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum--was not for her use alone but was to be shared with the dozen
or so members of her club who also suffer from sickle cell anemia. She
said the effects of marijuana were far less harmful than the morphine she
had been prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   But since 1998, she said, she has been under scrutiny because of her
plants. Police seized her stock that year, and she spent two weeks in
jail. She beat that case, however, and her confiscated plants were
returned.</TE>
<TE>   Her club continued to operate without problems until last year, when
police, with helicopters hovering overhead, searched her two-story home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting having a cup of coffee with a little hemp oil when they
broke down the door," she said. "I said, 'I'm legal, I have a doctor's
note and I'm compliant with the law.' "</TE>
<TE>   She said the officers told her they thought she had too much to be for
personal use only.</TE>
<TE>   "I said 'OK, why don't you take what you think I don't need and leave
me the rest?' " she recalled. "They took it all."</TE>
<TE>   She disputed law enforcement's estimate of her stash.</TE>
<TE>   "That is 200 pounds wet, with dirt and stalks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kildebeck said he doubted that Kambui would be tried as a third-strike
defendant because the current charge does not involve violent conduct.
"We're trying to do the right thing too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Her neighbors also seemed sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Mercado said Kambui should be allowed to use marijuana if it is
for her personal use and not for sale in the neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>It's Decision Time for MTA in the Battle Over Bus Service</HD>
<DH>Transit: Board is to vote today to abide by a court agreement or
seek a final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of Los Angeles County's transit system will meet in
closed session today to decide whether to continue its five-year legal
fight against a federal court agreement requiring vastly improved bus
service.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board is scheduled to vote
on whether to simply abide by all aspects of the agreement or try for a
final appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   An appeal would be the board's fifth attempt at a legal review, one
that would infuriate bus passenger and civil rights advocates.</LD>
<TE>   Some activists fear that if the high court took the case and ruled in
the MTA's favor, it could weaken court-mandated civil rights agreements
that protect people in a variety of other circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Even by considering this, the board is showing its outright
hostility, not only to bus riders in this county, but to the cause of
civil rights nationwide," said Eric Mann, head of the Bus Riders Union,
the advocacy group that was the lead plaintiff in the court challenge
against the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Despite frequent protests from Mann and others, many MTA board members
have remained intent on fighting the agreement because they say an order
to buy more buses could severely affect the agency's treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the agreement, the court could force the agency to
add hundreds more buses to a fleet already numbering about 2,100. MTA
officials say that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly
forcing cutbacks in critical highway and rail programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're charged with providing not only buses, but all different kinds
of mobility in this county," said Roger Snoble, chief executive of the
transit agency, who would not say what he will recommend to the board.
"This agreement hamstrings us from being able to do all of that."</TE>
<TE>   The vote by the 13-member panel promises to be a close one.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually certain to go against an appeal is a bloc led by Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn, who has consistently balked at the legal challenges
since joining the board last year. The mayor hopes that the three MTA
board members he appointed will vote with him, but he realizes he must
sway several others.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, Hahn sent letters to the entire board Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "To continue to challenge aspects of the agreement is without strong
legal merit," wrote the former Los Angeles city attorney. It "is unfair
to transit users who deserve the highest level of service."</TE>
<TE>   Five board members, including county Supervisor Mike Antonovich and
board Chairman John Fasana, are likely to vote against Hahn and for the
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves key votes in the hands of MTA board members Zev
Yaroslavsky, Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke--all county
supervisors and political liberals. Each has voted to appeal in the past.
None would say which way he or she was leaning going into today's vote.</TE>
<TE>   It has been five years since the MTA willingly signed the federal
agreement rather than face a court battle in a lawsuit filed by bus rider
advocates and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claimed that the bus system, which carries the bulk of the
MTA's customers, was being deprived, while the agency was spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on a subway and rail system.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement bound the nation's second-largest transit system to a
vast upgrade of its bus service and established a strict set of
benchmarks by which improvement would be measured.</TE>
<TE>   But, although it signed willingly, the MTA has balked and mounted
legal challenges virtually from the outset.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts have summarily been shot down. A federal judge, a
court-appointed special master and a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Circuit Court all turned back MTA appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the agency tried an appeal to a broad panel of federal
judges. In October, the judges voted unanimously that the MTA's legal
arguments did not merit further review.</TE>
<TE>   Such resounding defeats do not bode well for the possibility that the
Supreme Court would even consider the case.</TE>
<TE>   Still, MTA administrators continue to have numerous objections to the
court order. They question the power of special master Donald Bliss, a
Washington lawyer appointed by the federal court, who has ordered the MTA
to buy new buses.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also continues to balk at "load factors"--a statistical
tool used to measure bus crowding. Part of the agreement calls on the
agency to reach numerous benchmarks. The final load factor goal, due June
30, requires that the number of passengers standing on MTA buses should
be no more than 20% of the number with seats. The measure is taken in
20-minute increments.</TE>
<TE>   The load issue has dogged the agreement from the start. The MTA
contends that it needs to be in compliance with the measurement only most
of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unreasonable to think there will never be a moment when you
don't go over that limit," said Snoble, who, like many board members,
believes that the standard for determining bus overcrowding is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   He also contends that the 2,100-bus MTA fleet has already met all of
the benchmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Bus rider advocates and their lawyers have steadfastly disagreed,
contending that not enough buses have been placed into service to ensure
that the goal is achieved at all times. The advocates cite data showing
that crowding has lessened on some MTA buses, but that other goals have
remained unmet for years.</TE>
<TE>   "They've put more buses on the road, but they are still far short of
where they need to be," Mann said. "Looking at these violations, how can
we back down?"</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts believe that a Supreme Court review of the MTA case
would have far broader implications--spurring other government agencies
to seek reviews of their federal court agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "It could definitely do damage," said USC professor Erwin Chemerinsky.
"Ultimately, this is a civil rights case."</TE>
<TE>   But others, including civil rights attorney Constance Rice, said the
matter would not set a precedent on civil rights law.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, lead counsel for bus advocates when the matter first went to
court, said the MTA appeal is based on a narrow interpretation of
contract law that should not affect other civil rights cases.</TE>

<HD>On the Mayor's Street, Vacation Is a Quiet Time</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Could you feel it? The ship of state--the ship of city--steady as
she goes once more?</LD>
<LD>   That's because the captain is back at the helm. Jim Hahn has returned
to City Hall. The mayor was on vacation for three weeks, which makes, in
all, five weeks of vacation that he's taken since he was sworn in six
months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now I'm kicking myself. Why didn't I run for mayor? I haven't had a
vacation for nearly two years. It's a taxing job, columnizing. Maybe
there's a more restful line of work out there, like leading the nation's
second-biggest city.</LD>
<TE>   A politician's vacation is harder to pull off than a balanced budget.
He runs the risk of looking too casual about the job, or sending a signal
that things can get along fine without him. Before 9/11, George W. Bush
spent 42% of his presidency on vacation or en route to one, and was
mocked as a 24-7 leader: 24 hours a week, seven months a year.</TE>
<TE>   Among L.A.'s mayors, Sam Yorty was savaged as Travelin' Sam for his
hither-and-yon ways. Tom Bradley, in one astounding stretch, spent two of
eight years out of L.A., mostly out of the country, on trips always
described as "city business." No wonder they named the airport's
international terminal for him--it must've seemed more like home than
City Hall. And Richard Riordan, who bikes, skis and ice-skates, caught
flak for going to the places rich guys go to do those things, like the
south of France and Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn only went as far as Hawaii with the family in August, and stayed
home for these three weeks while his kids were out of school.</TE>
<TE>   Just what does a mayor do with three weeks, so close to City Hall and
yet so far? On the principle that even a cat may look at a king, this cat
spent one of her nine lives on the mayor's street in San Pedro last week.</TE>
<TE>   12:12 p.m. A Chevy SUV pulls up in front of a house where crossed
candy canes still adorn the bottlebrush tree, and Christmas lights still
drape the sedulously trimmed hedge. Since the Hahns bought the house in
1985, the year Hahn became city attorney, the garage has filled to the
point that there is no room for a car. So an SUV and a sedan--both
American-made, an article of political faith preached by Hahn's
father--sit in the stub of a driveway. The mayor parks on the street. He
is wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap in faded red. He glances into
the garage and walks into the house.</TE>
<TE>   This is a modest neighborhood where success can be gauged not by the
smallish houses but by the biggish toys: satellite dishes, extended-cab
trucks, an occasional boat. Hahn's place has none of these.</TE>
<TE>   I have been to other mayors' homes. Sam Yorty lived for 37 years on an
acre-with-pool spread in Studio City that he bought from Mickey Rooney.
Bradley and his wife lived rent-free for 16 years like Mr. and Mrs.
Havisham in the fading Getty House, a place appointed in the
avocado-green tint that was the last word in home decor when LBJ was in
the White House. Riordan had his Brentwood manor house with books,
plural, and gardens, plural. And now here's this ordinary house on a
sliver of land in a genuinely middle-American neighborhood. The lord of
this manor has been known to steam off his own wallpaper.</TE>
<TE>   12:16 p.m. Hahn emerges with a cardboard pizza box. Will he put it in
the brown trash bin or the blue recycling bin? It's . . . the blue! Civic
leadership by example!</TE>
<TE>   12:45 p.m. I wait. I check phone messages and return calls, one of
them to Riordan. Here I am, watching the man who spent his whole life
hoping to be mayor, talking to the man who just decided last summer to
run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   12:53 p.m. I imagine Hahn laboring inside. Maybe it is here and here
alone that he focuses best. Behind that door, this Perry Como of mayors
may be a changed man, plotting his commanding urban strategy far from the
distractions of phones and e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   1:12 p.m. He gets in the Chevy with his daughter. They drive off. I
lose them at the intersection. I return to the mayor's street and,
inspired by his garage, tidy up my car.</TE>
<TE>   2:11 p.m. They're back. The mayor totes bags inside (plastic, not
paper) and returns for an armload of dry-cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   2:47 p.m. The sun is hot. My mind wanders. That garage--is it a
metaphor for L.A., big and cluttered but with room for more, and
everything is there if you just know your way around it?</TE>
<TE>   3:03 p.m. The mayor's kids and their friends are playing around the
Chevy, and they set off the alarm. They scatter. The alarm switches off
in its own sweet time.</TE>
<TE>   3:14 p.m. They set the alarm off again. This time the mayor comes out
and zaps it off.</TE>
<TE>   4:18 p.m. An ice cream truck burbles down the street, in time to ruin
everyone's supper. The chief executive of the City of the Angels is not
tempted. The front door stays closed. The garage door stays open.</TE>

<LD>About 40 oak trees that are to be cut in the next few weeks to make
way for the Lang Ranch dam could get a reprieve while a county supervisor
studies critics' concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Kathy Long on Tuesday asked that plans be put on hold until
she can review the project with public works officials. Her request came
after dam opponents asked the Board of Supervisors to consider their
concerns about the dam's size and location.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not trying to indicate to the community that there's a change on
this project, but I'd like to get these questions answered," Long said.</LD>
<TE>   County flood control officials have said the dam is needed to protect
homeowners and habitats downstream in the event of a 100-year storm.</TE>

<HD>Open-Space District Wins Board Support</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisors unanimous in backing creation of an entity to
buy and preserve undeveloped property. The issue is slated for a public
vote in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously
backed creation of a land conservation district, clearing the way for
local voters to weigh in on the issue on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will decide whether Ventura County should join a growing list
of counties seeking to prevent urban sprawl by buying up undeveloped land
for permanent preservation.</LD>
<LD>   Even more critical, voters will be asked to tax themselves to pay for
the land purchases, either through a sales tax increase or a property
assessment.</LD>
<TE>   After three years of debate and several delays, open-space supporters
applauded county policymakers for using their clout to bring the district
closer to reality.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to take a giant step forward today," said Roma Armbrust,
a Ventura environmental advocate. "This will be a great opportunity for
everyone in Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels dropped earlier opposition to the plan after
board members assured her that they did not intend to create the district
without a public vote.</TE>
<TE>   That requirement also was made by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson
(D-Santa Barbara), who has agreed to carry the legislation necessary to
place the issue before local voters.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said she is pleased that her colleagues agreed to create an
advisory committee to help define the district's goals and land-purchase
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The broad-based committee will be made up of representatives from the
county, its 10 cities, environmental groups and the business community.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing more critical than having voter buy-in for the
long-term success of this district," Mikels said. "I am extremely pleased
to be able to move this forward in a way that I am comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors split on who should pay the estimated $416,000 cost of
preparing the ballot measure and hiring consultants to advise on it.</TE>
<TE>   On a 3-2 vote, with Supervisors John Flynn and Steve Bennett
dissenting, the board postponed that decision until its summer budget
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers supported creation of a district, calling it the best
way to preserve the county's semi-rural feel.</TE>
<TE>   The SOAR anti-sprawl initiatives protect much of the county from
development, but those laws will begin to expire in 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of organizations prepared to help educate the
public in the benefits of this district," said Mark Burley, member of the
county's SOAR growth-control group.</TE>
<TE>   Even groups that have previously opposed growth restrictions appeared
to accept that a conservation district may soon become reality. They are
now focusing on ways to create the district so that some development can
still occur.</TE>
<TE>   A speaker from the Greater L.A/Ventura Chapter of the Building
Industry Assn., for instance, said the district should only be funded for
20 years so voters can decide if it has successfully accomplished its
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Properties targeted for preservation should also be prioritized, with
some left off the list to help the county meet housing needs, said Rondi
Guthrie, a BIA spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   County officials have pursued a conservation district since 1998, when
68% of voters said they wanted one.</TE>
<TE>   A recent public opinion poll commissioned by supervisors showed that
support has grown, with 75% favoring a district.</TE>
<TE>   But voters are much less unified when it comes to paying for it.</TE>
<TE>   The poll suggested that it would be difficult to obtain the two-thirds
vote needed for a sales tax hike, but that a property tax assessment,
which requires a simple majority, is possible.</TE>

<LD>A Newport-Mesa Unified School District trustee pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor drunk driving but said he will not resign despite a board
member's calls that he step down.</LD>
<LD>   James M. Ferryman, 53, was placed on three years' probation Monday and
ordered to enroll in a first-time offender alcohol treatment program,
according to court records.</LD>
<LD>   He will also have to submit to chemical tests on demand, pay a $1,241
fine and drive on a restricted license for three months, according to
court records.</LD>
<TE>   Ferryman was arrested after a two-car accident on Newport Boulevard on
Sept. 27. Tests showed he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.19%, more than
twice the legal limit, authorities said. Since then, Newport-Mesa Trustee
Wendy Leece has called for Ferryman's resignation three times.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to finish my term," Ferryman said Tuesday. "It is nice to
get this behind me, but it's not the end of the world."</TE>

<HD>Coad to Chair Supervisors</HD>
<DH>El Toro: Her reelection means the board's pro-airport majority will
continue its push.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county's El Toro airport fight took center stage once again
Tuesday with the reelection of Cynthia P. Coad, one of three pro-airport
supervisors, as chairwoman of the county board. She will have airport
critic Tom Wilson as vice chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Although largely ceremonial in years past, the post now carries
political weight and is critical in the planning of an airport at the
closed El Toro Marine base. The chair also sets board agendas and
represents the county to many private and public agencies, including the
Navy and the Federal Aviation Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Coad's selection signals that the board's pro-airport majority will
continue to plan a commercial airport at El Toro despite growing voter
opposition and an anti-airport initiative on the March ballot. If passed,
Measure W would replace airport zoning at the 4,700-acre base with zoning
for a large park and other development.</LD>
<TE>   "I was pleased that the supervisors recognized that I had a good track
record of working in the community," Coad said.</TE>
<TE>   The chairwoman's term is for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is one of two supervisors up for reelection this year; she faces
Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby, who opposes an airport at El Toro.
Supervisor Jim Silva is running unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   But reelection as chairwoman may hurt, rather than help, Coad during
her campaign because it points up her pro-airport stance, said Fred
Smoller, director of the Henley Social Sciences Research Laboratory at
Chapman University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "Coad has been good for the Hispanic community and constituency
service, but she has this El Toro airport around her neck," Smoller said.
"So if Measure W passes, will the electorate punish the people pushing
for the airport?"</TE>
<TE>   Because of that possibility, being board chair "will not help her,"
Smoller said. "But it could potentially hurt her if voters target her as
one of the main supporters for an airport."</TE>
<TE>   But Coad believes voters will not only recognize her record, but also
the fact that she has been involved in "many big issues," other than the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that people realize that I have a lot of good things I'm
working on, and I hope that they understand that with an airport, it will
provide new jobs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger surprise was Wilson's unanimous election as vice chairman, a
position he has held twice before. Described as hard-working and
energetic by board colleagues, Wilson's anti-airport stance has prevented
him from getting the board chairman's job.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that Tom Wilson has long demonstrated the
capabilities of that position," Supervisor Chuck Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he could not support Wilson as board chairman because that
would be "too disruptive" to the airport planning process. "But I have
worked well with Tom in the past." Wilson said he was pleased with the
vote and the board's "vote of confidence."</TE>

<HD>Runoff Rules Not So Costly, Some Say</HD>
<DH>Water: Environmental activists say O.C. agencies' estimates for
complying with state edicts are misleading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With stringent water runoff rules proposed for Orange County,
environmentalists say local officials are misleading state water
regulators about the cost of complying--a charge local representatives
deny.</LD>
<LD>   County and city officials say they will spend nearly $59 million to
comply with existing storm-water regulations this year, and that the new
regulations would cost an additional $29 million annually. The Natural
Resources Defense Council says those costs include programs created
before existing runoff rules, and that future costs are unsubstantiated.</LD>
<LD>   The environmental group's analysis of county and city documents comes
as two key votes are scheduled on the rules--one today for South County
and a second next week for northern and central Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed rules, intended to reduce the amount of polluted runoff
tainting waterways and the ocean, are provisions of five-year storm-water
runoff permits mandated by the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   Runoff--the car oil, pet waste and other contaminants washed off
streets and lawns into storm drains, creeks and eventually the ocean--is
the No. 1 cause of coastal pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   New requirements will include strict inspections of construction
sites, carwashes, restaurants and other businesses that produce runoff.
Discharges from storm drains cannot result in violations of state
water-quality limits.</TE>
<TE>   Through Freedom of Information Act requests, the environmental group
said it learned that 86% of existing compliance costs are for preexisting
local programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern is that [local officials] are misleading board members
about the cost of complying with storm-water permits," said David
Beckman, an attorney in the environmental group's Los Angeles office.
"Given that the primary objection that the cities are making about
storm-water-permit compliance is cost, I think this raises very
disturbing and serious questions about the accuracy of their testimony."</TE>
<TE>   County Environmental Manager Chris Crompton said that while programs
such as street sweeping have been included in the compliance costs, they
do stop pollutants from entering waterways and therefore help meet the
permits' objectives.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been doing things to protect water quality," he said.
"We're proactive in a number of areas and have been for a long period of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Crompton also said the costs are estimates.</TE>

<HD>County Will Pay Bonus to Staff for Working at Polls</HD>
<DH>Elections: To tighten voting procedures, supervisors plan to
compensate employees who volunteer to serve at balloting sites. They will
earn daily rate plus $50.</DH>

<LD>In an effort to shed the county's reputation for election day
problems, county supervisors approved a plan Tuesday to pay as many as
1,700 county employees to serve as poll workers.</LD>
<LD>   The volunteer program--which would let employees draw their normal
salary as well as a $50 stipend--is an effort to pump up a growing
shortage of precinct workers, Registrar of Voters Rosalyn Lever said. She
said she is hopeful that bilingual employees, particularly those who
speak Spanish and Vietnamese, will volunteer to work polls in ethnic
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   At least 500 county workers are expected to volunteer by the March
primary. It is hoped that as many as 1,700 employees will sign up by the
November general election, Lever said. The county employs 17,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   The program, which will cost $119,000, is the latest in a series of
changes that have swept through Lever's department. In September, the
county agreed to a $1.1-million budget boost to hire 13 additional
employees and bolster an elections department criticized for problems
during the 2000 general election.</TE>
<TE>   The county came under fire for problems Nov. 7 that included 40,000
sample ballots being shipped late to Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking
voters, the misidentification of a Libertarian candidate as a Republican
on the ballot and a precinct that opened without any ballots. In
addition, Spanish-speaking voters complained they were treated poorly or
given misleading information in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Those problems occurred, in part, because of last-minute poll-worker
cancellations, Lever said. Lever usually has 7,000 volunteers working at
the county's 1,716 precincts. But the department typically receives about
1,000 cancellations within 30 days of an election and another 300
volunteers cancel less than 24 hours before the polls open.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes it difficult to fully staff all polling places with
trained poll workers by 7 a.m. when the polls open," Lever said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who has monitored reforms in Lever's
department such as technology upgrades, community outreach and training
for poll workers, said the next step is to appoint an advisory group to
help oversee the department.</TE>
<TE>   "I want that in place before the next election in March so they can
check on things prior to the election and after," Spitzer said. "I
believe it's very important that the county ensures all citizens their
right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Latino activist Amin David praised the new program as a step in the
right direction.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he and other activists will encourage the Latino
community to take advantage of the county's new programs and exercise
their right to vote in the coming elections.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new program, each county department will be expected to
allow at least 5% of staff to volunteer as poll workers in the March
primary election and 10% for the November general election.</TE>
<TE>   Employees will receive their county pay and the $50 stipend, the
amount normally paid to precinct workers.</TE>
<TE>   Millard Thornton, Orange County Employee's Assn. president, said he is
excited about the program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a very satisfying day for the volunteers," Thornton
said in a prepared statement.</TE>

<HD>Disney Shows Its True Colors With Angels' Red Era</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today may seem like just another day to you, but it isn't.</LD>
<LD>   This is "Red Dawn" day in Orange County. No, it's not part of a Tom
Clancy book tour. Nor are you in imminent danger, as the somewhat
forbidding designation suggests. Stay in your homes, and you'll be
perfectly safe.</LD>
<LD>   No, "Red Dawn" is the start of a new era in Angels baseball.</LD>
<TE>   Would that it were true. Actually, it's nothing more than a corporate
decision to change the team's uniform and logo in the hopes of selling
more merchandise to you, the loyal fan. Think of it as the baseball
equivalent of the new spring line from Versace or Donna Karan.</TE>
<TE>   You may hear some team officials say that the switch, in which red
will be prominently featured, is about creating a new identity for the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Before swallowing that, take note of these remarks from a Disney
official: "The new uniform is all about creating a new identity for the
club. . . . We're also trying to reinforce that this is a new era for the
Angels."</TE>
<TE>   That was said way, way back in 1997, the last time uniforms were
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember that bygone era? Don't feel bad if you don't. That was
before Troy Glaus joined the team.</TE>
<TE>   Eras apparently come and go a lot faster than they used to. Today
marks the team's "red" era. This follows the "periwinkle" era.</TE>
<TE>   Who's calling the shots here? Picasso?</TE>
<TE>   You may be thinking I'm a bad sport about all this.</TE>
<TE>   Far from it. I'm just a baseball fan who prefers to associate his
"eras" with pennants and World Series appearances, rather than apparel.</TE>
<TE>   My baseball heart happens to be with the Pittsburgh Pirates, an
attachment made 40-odd years ago. I like the Angels, though, and root for
them. Like all fans, I fancy myself a baseball expert.</TE>
<TE>   In that spirit, I remind the locals that the Pirates added red to
their caps and logos before the 1997 season. In seasons since, the
Pirates have lost 83, 93, 83, 93 and 100 games.</TE>
<TE>   And I thought the caps would make a difference. . . .</TE>
<TE>   The point is, the Angels have credibility problems with the fans.
Attendance has steadily dropped in recent years--even with the lure of
the Rally Monkey showing up.</TE>
<TE>   Disney management knows that changing the colors won't change the
mood. My question is: Do they know what will change it?</TE>
<TE>   A winning team would help. The Angels could wear pink and yellow
uniforms and nobody would mind if Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were
in the pitching rotation.</TE>
<TE>   They're not available, but Disney hasn't shown much interest in
playing the big-money game to acquire free-agent talent. I don't condemn
them for that, but when they settle for lesser mortals, their baseball
savvy has been sorely lacking. You can't blame the fans for not
appreciating duds.</TE>
<TE>   There's another part of running a baseball team that, strangely
enough, has nothing to do with players. If only Disney knew that.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Padres (a crummy team that outdraws the Angels) promote
an occasional Monday night game in which all available seats go for $5.
You can park for a buck and buy a hot dog for a dollar too.</TE>
<TE>   That's how you maintain a fan base.</TE>
<TE>   You also do it with concessionaires who--how to put this nicely--at
least act like they want to serve you quickly. I've missed entire innings
of Angels games due to the lethargic pace of behind-the-counter people,
whose motto seems to be "Don't worry, there's another game tomorrow
night."</TE>
<TE>   So yippee for Red Dawn day in Orange County. I'd rather have the
promise of more speed in the lineup or the concession line, but if
clothes make the man, maybe they can make a team too.</TE>
<TE>   But forgive me if I don't commit heart and soul to this new era.</TE>
<TE>   Know why? Here's the rest of what that same Disney official said in
1997: "This uniform will last as long as it is making the statement the
team wants to make."</TE>
<TE>   That sense of sentimentality and tradition just makes you want to rush
out and renew those season tickets, doesn't it?</TE>

<LD>Concerned about delays in court-ordered services for juvenile
offenders, Ventura County supervisors Tuesday agreed to transfer a
psychologist from the county's Behavioral Health Department to its
Probation Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Several public speakers told supervisors the delays are caused by
department managers warring over who is responsible for providing the
youths with mental health evaluations and other services.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors will review the issue at their Jan. 15 meeting. They also
directed County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston to mediate the
disputes.</LD>

<HD>LAX Panel to Seek Bids on Expanded PR Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without a word of discussion, Los Angeles Airport commissioners
voted unanimously Tuesday to seek bids on a new and expanded public
relations contract for Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners' decision came four days after Encino-based Winner &amp;
Associates pulled out of a contract extension with the city's airport
department to inform the public about plans to expand LAX.</LD>
<LD>   The one-year extension with the politically connected firm had been
approved by commissioners last month and was worth up to $1.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Winner &amp; Associates was hired in 1998 to conduct public outreach for
former Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to expand LAX. The firm and its
subcontractors had received $8.7 million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan's plan died when he left office. Incoming Mayor James K.
Hahn embarked on a course that, instead of pushing for expansion,
emphasizes making LAX safer and more secure.</TE>
<TE>   Company President Charles Winner said last week that unfair criticism
of his firm's contract led him to sever the relationship with the
airport. Winner said he did not want controversy to overshadow Hahn's new
plans for LAX.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn said Tuesday in Ontario that he hopes Winner will bid on the
new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Winner hosted three fund-raisers for Hahn in connection with last
year's mayoral campaign. The executive and his associates gave more than
$20,000 to Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the fund-raisers held by Winner have had no influence on any
actions related to the airport contract.</TE>

<HD>Developer May Lose Sunset Billboard OK</HD>
<DH>West Hollywood: City Council will vote on whether to repeal permit
after builder's credibility is called into question. Project's finances
could be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Questions in West Hollywood about a developer's credibility have
triggered a City Hall backlash against a controversial $250-million
Sunset Strip commercial project.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council took steps late Monday to yank builder Mark Siffin's
permit to erect billboards that would crown his proposed Sunset
Millennium development and pump an estimated $4.3 million a year into it.
The city's action could affect the financial prospects of the
two-block-long development.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council's unusual step toward repealing the billboard
authorization came during an emotional public hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents accused Siffin of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
to buy the support of neighbors and of secretly scrapping plans to build
a 370-room luxury hotel as the centerpiece of the project, which would
also include offices and retail shops.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-2 council vote came as officials sidestepped a request from
Siffin's opponents to schedule a public referendum seeking to block the
big rental billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin received authorization for the outdoor signboards last
September after advising officials that revenue from the signs was needed
to help finance his project. A short time later, though, he disclosed
that an apartment building would be built instead of a hotel, although it
might be converted to a hotel later. Siffin blamed the economic aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for the change.</TE>
<TE>   He tried Monday to persuade council members that a hotel was still
earmarked as part of the sprawling project. But Mayor John Heilman
disclosed that he has obtained a real estate broker's report done for
Siffin that touts "446 luxury apartments" planned for the site at the
corner of Sunset and La Cienega boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin depicted the report as merely "a draft of a study to analyze an
alternative development project."</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Sal Guarriello, a former supporter, was not satisfied.
"I want a true answer," Guarriello said. "I've stuck with you five years.
But you haven't been honest with me the last four or five months."</TE>
<TE>   Guarriello joined Heilman and Councilman John Duran in asking city
lawyers to bring a motion to the council on Jan. 22 to repeal the
billboard authorization.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin denied lying and said he would like to see a hotel there.</TE>
<TE>Luxury Hotel Seen as Source of Tax Revenue</TE>
<TE>   City officials have long looked at a luxury hotel as an important
source of a predicted $8 million in yearly tax revenue from the overall
662,800-square-foot development.</TE>
<TE>   But project opponents have consistently complained that problems would
outweigh benefits. Besides spoiling nearby views of the Los Angeles
basin, foes have asserted, Sunset Millennium would put hundreds more cars
onto an already jammed Sunset Strip. And a street closure required by the
development also might delay firetrucks and ambulances responding to
emergencies in the area, some have warned.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents charged Monday night that Siffin had planned to drop the
hotel from the project as early as last April, when he negotiated one of
what city leaders say may be a dozen "mutual support and benefits
agreements" with residents of neighboring condominium associations.
Siffin said he was not certain Monday how many have been signed.</TE>
<TE>   The confidential agreements promised payments to nearby condominium
associations in exchange for residents' active public support of Sunset
Millennium. Owners of units in one building had to pledge to "conduct
information and outreach meetings" and agree to not criticize Sunset
Millennium to the city "or in the news media" in exchange for payments
totaling $200,000 to their association.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in support of the project because they are being paid,"
opponent G.G. Verone complained Monday to council members. "They are
lobbyists. They should be listed as lobbyists."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing was peppered with complaints that a billboard firm with
its own signs elsewhere on Sunset Strip was behind the campaign for the
anti-Siffin billboard referendum petitions. But Brian Kennedy, head of
the Regency billboard company, responded that "We were asked to be
involved and were delighted to be."</TE>
<TE>   Because the council may be taking action against the proposed Siffin
billboards later this month, there was no need to set a citywide
referendum election.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Siffin refused to criticize Guarriello for casting
the deciding vote. He said he would continue the construction now
underway. "It's a great project," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters also said the fight isn't over.</TE>
<TE>   Jehuda Renan, whose condominium association is to receive $120,000
from Siffin for a new roof, said supporters may try to block Heilman from
voting on the repeal Jan. 22 on grounds that Heilman lives within 500
yards of the Sunset Millennium site.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, Heilman must recuse himself from voting on the issue,
Renan said.</TE>
<TE>   Verone, meanwhile, said her struggle isn't over, either.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got two weeks. They're going to be putting pressure on Sal to
change his vote," she said.</TE>

<HD>Ontario Gets More Service to Mexico</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Daily flight to Hermosillo is expected to help spread
travel among Southland airports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials stepped up their efforts to spread air
travel among Southern California's regional airports with the
inauguration Tuesday of a daily flight between Ontario International
Airport and the northwest Mexican town of Hermosillo.</LD>
<LD>   But even as lawmakers attempted to move forward with their pre-Sept.
11 agenda for redistributing air traffic, economic fallout from the
terrorist attacks continued to reverberate in the city's airport agency.</LD>
<LD>   Lost revenue and increased security costs since the attacks prompted
the Airport Commission on Tuesday to unanimously approve a steep increase
in parking rates at Los Angeles International Airport, Ontario airport
and the Van Nuys FlyAway lot.</LD>
<TE>   Later in the same meeting, several representatives of LAX businesses
pleaded with the seven commissioners for an extension of the $9.5 million
in rent relief they received last year. The cuts were in compensation for
business lost after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear Tuesday whether such financial relief will occur.
Mayor James K. Hahn said airport businesses have already received rent
reductions among the most generous of any major airport in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all going through a lot of pain out at LAX. The key to that is
not giving more [rent] concessions, but to figure out how we get more
traffic and more passengers and business," Hahn told reporters at Ontario
airport, which is operated by the city of Los Angeles. "That's where I
want to focus my efforts."</TE>
<TE>   The challenges facing local airports were evident just a few yards
from where the mayor joined a mariachi band and dancers in welcoming
AeroMexico's first flight from Hermosillo to Ontario. A newsstand was
closed and the lights turned out at midday, right in the heart of
Terminal 2.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn held out high hopes for the new air service. During a
November trade mission, he persuaded the airline to set a specific time
frame for implementing the new service.</TE>
<TE>   He said Tuesday that the AeroMexico flights "highlight Ontario as an
important new international gateway for travelers."</TE>
<TE>   "Since 9/11, we've seen declines in traffic, and everyone is cutting
back," he said. "But we see a commitment and courageousness on the part
of AeroMexico to say, 'We're not going to cut back, but we'll expand.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ontario has experienced some of these reductions in service. Since
Sept. 11, start-up carrier JetBlue has eliminated one daily nonstop
flight to New York, and United Airlines has cut six flights a day between
Ontario and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire airport has historically had a tough time getting
international service off the ground. AeroMexico is the only airline
flying passenger planes into Ontario from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   A service operated by Air Canada to Toronto was canceled after just 89
days. Three airlines canceled service to Guadalajara in 1993 after only
eight months.</TE>
<TE>   But, as part of its plan to expand service between Mexico and the
U.S., AeroMexico added Ontario to its list of American destinations in
December 2000, with flights three times a week between Guadalajara and
Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Ontario, Hermosillo is a thriving industrial center in its own
right," said Tony Batista, AeroMexico's manager of sales and distribution
in the U.S. "This demonstrates AeroMexico's solid commitment to serving
Ontario."</TE>
<TE>   The 1 1/2-hour flight from San Bernardino County to northwest Mexico
will deliver passengers to a regional hub where they can make connections
to other destinations or remain on the same plane to Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope to reverse Ontario's poor record for international
service by making the new airport terminals easier to use.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do more, because I really want to see Ontario grow," Hahn
said. "There is unused capacity out here. The population is moving
eastward."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last summer, Hahn asked airport commissioners to "take
immediate steps to make Ontario International Airport a more
business-friendly airport," citing six initiatives to attract new air
service.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Airport Commission President Ted Stein gave a progress
report on the initiatives as the commission prepared to vote to lower
fees charged to airlines to land at Ontario by 22%, the first initiative
in Hahn's letter. The commission approved that decrease as it raised
landing fees at LAX about 28%.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also voted to lower short-term parking rates in some
Ontario lots--the second initiative--while raising them significantly at
LAX. Parking revenues since the attacks are down 33% at Ontario and 40%
at LAX, said Michael Biagi, division manager of landside operations. He
added that increased security at LAX parking garages is costing more than
$400,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The panel increased the daily rate at lots in the heart of the LAX
complex from $24 to $30 and at Ontario from $21 to $28 a day. The Ontario
lot is meant for two-hour parking only, but if motorists exceed the
limit, they will be charged a $24 penalty on top of the $4 assessed for
the two hours.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency had slashed its budget for promoting Ontario by
more than $2 million a year, but it will now spend $150,000 in public
funds to market the new AeroMexico service as part of another Hahn
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials said the future of AeroMexico's new service relies
on the Inland Empire's growing Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has to support that service, or the airline certainly
will abandon the market," said Dennis Watson, public affairs director for
Ontario airport.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, on Tuesday, only 11 passengers boarded AeroMexico's maiden
flight to Hermosillo.</TE>

<HD>Charges Dropped Against Ex-Felon</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors on Tuesday dismissed all charges against
a man who spent two years in prison for a robbery that officials now
believe was probably committed by another man.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came amid mounting evidence that George Lopez had nothing
to do with the May 1999 robbery of an Anaheim loan office. Two of the
robbery victims said Lopez wasn't the gunman, and another man said that
he--and not Lopez--committed the crime.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the fifth time in two years the Orange County district
attorney's office has dropped charges against convicted felons after new
evidence came up.</LD>
<TE>   The jury that convicted Lopez in February 2000 never learned that
another man pleaded guilty to committing three nearly identical robberies
the same week. That man, Johnny SantaCruz, told The Times in July that he
committed the Anaheim robbery. The new evidence prompted a judge in
September to free Lopez while he decided whether to grant a new trial.</TE>

<LD>He's one of Dodger Stadium's most famous performers, a guy who has

show's custom, he and his two impersonators said, in turn, "My name is
Roger Owens and I work for peanuts," then threw peanut bags into the
crowd. "I made a real wimpy throw on purpose," Owens confessed. "And I
didn't show them my behind-the-back pitch."</LD>
<TE>   One of the fake Roger Owenses, a Navy employee, didn't fool anyone,
especially when he was asked where the Dodgers play. His answer: Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   But the other fake Owens received votes from two of the panelists. "He
had a great arm," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   This impostor's real job? "He's a telephone psychic," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it figured that in any group of three workers in L.A., one
would have to be a telephone psychic.</TE>

<TE>   On his radio show on KSPN-AM (1110), co-host Joe (the Big Nasty)
McDonnell said of UCLA basketball star Jason Kapono: "He burned my
albacore." Kapono is a part-time chef at Trani's restaurant in Long
Beach, where McDonnell dines.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono, however, denied the accusation and McDonnell, in the spirit of
fair play, played a tape of Kapono saying, in mock anger, "Joe
McDonnell's a liar."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell added that he considers Kapono a fine chef who merely had an
off night. Anyway, Kapono's primary interest these days is basketball.
And, as his high-scoring average attests, he often "burns" his opponent,
if you'll pardon the expression.</TE>
<TE>   Milestones in pest control: On Tuesday, I related how a Hollywood
bartender trapped a cockroach in an upside-down glass, poured rum all
around it, released the bug and ignited the rum with a lighter.</TE>
<TE>   Which reminded Ed Van den Bossche of Newport Beach about a date he had
at a Laguna Beach restaurant years ago. "After we'd ordered, I noticed a
cockroach creeping down the wall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It stopped about a foot above the table and was surveying the scene
with raised feelers. I didn't do anything, not knowing if Jean had seen
the thing or not.</TE>
<TE>   "As the roach started to move again, Jean said: 'If he takes one step
onto the table, I'm going to kill him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Van den Bossche: "This was an early clue that she was my kind
of gal." And, in fact, she became his wife.</TE>
<TE>   And the roach? "It did step onto the table," he said, "and she trapped
him under a glass, but we just left him in there."</TE>
<TE>   Not worth wasting rum on.</TE>

<LD>Emergency rooms--In a Section A article Dec. 29 about difficulties
in getting physician specialists to respond to hospital emergency rooms,
an ER physician at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas was misquoted.
The doctor, Michele Grad, was quoted as saying that a hand surgeon on
call refused to come in to operate on a man who had nearly severed three
fingers and, as a result of the delays, two of the fingers had to be
amputated. Grad actually said that the hand surgeon came in and tried to
refer the patient to another hospital and that delays may have resulted
in amputations. The hospital says its records show that the injury
involved only a finger and a thumb and that only part of the finger had
to be amputated. The hospital contends that delays were not extreme and
played no role in the outcome.</LD>

<HD>Attorneys Trade Charges in Smith Inheritance Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyer for Texas oil tycoon's heir denies claims of lying
and calls the former playmate 'paranoid' in heated closing arguments at
Santa Ana hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney for former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith on
Tuesday accused her former stepson of lying under oath, falsifying
documents and spying on her with private detectives, all in a scheme to
cheat Smith out of her Texas oil tycoon husband's multimillion-dollar
estate.</LD>
<LD>   Those charges came amid a nasty exchange during closing arguments in
the month-long federal court hearing in Santa Ana over the fortune of J.
Howard Marshall II, a Houston oilman who married the centerfold three
years after meeting her at a Texas strip club in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney for Marshall's son, E. Pierce Marshall, called Smith's
allegations the unfounded fantasies of a "paranoid" woman. He also
accused her of putting on "her best Marilyn Monroe impersonation" when
she took the stand and was grilled about her testimony that her husband
promised her half his fortune.</LD>
<TE>   "[She] was not this poor uneducated little girl," said Texas attorney
Rusty Hardin, representing the son in this six-year legal battle.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin argued that J. Howard Marshall never made the promise, and
accused the former Guess jeans model of turning to the courts after being
left out of her husband's will. Hardin also said there was no evidence
that his client prevented his father from giving Smith any share of his
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has attended most of the trial, and on Tuesday was dressed in a
full-length, knit sweater and butterfly hair clips. She left the
courtroom when Hardin began his closing arguments to take a nap in a
private meeting room outside.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Philip W. Boesch of Los Angeles, argued that J. Howard
Marshall II clearly intended to provide for Smith, whose legal name is
Vicky Lynn Marshall. During the trial, Boesch played an audio tape of
Marshall saying that Smith was the "light of my life" and that he wanted
"my wife to be supported by me." Smith recorded the tape herself about
three months before he died.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest lie in this court is that J. Howard Marshall wanted all
of his wealth to go to. . .Pierce Marshall and not the person he loved
most--his wife," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing before U.S. District Judge David O. Carter marks Smith's
third legal battle over the Marshall estate, which has been valued from a
few hundred million dollars to more than a $1.6 billion. Smith was 26
when she married the 89-year-old tycoon in 1994. He died in August 1995,
14 months later.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Carter vacated a $475-million judgment that the former Playboy
pinup had won against her husband's estate in a Los Angeles bankruptcy
court last year. Carter decided that the ruling required a full review,
and is allowing attorneys to present key aspects of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Also in May, a probate court in Texas ruled that Smith had no claim to
Marshall's estate and that his son, E. Pierce Marshall, was the sole heir
of a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of closing arguments, Carter encouraged the two sides to
attempt to settle the case, although he acknowledged there might be only
a slim chance of that happening.</TE>
<TE>   Carter doesn't expect to release his opinion until the end of January,
at the earliest.</TE>

<HD>Secession Might Work With Cuts, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giving new hope to Los Angeles harbor area secessionists, a new
study has found that a bare-bones budget proposed by breakaway leaders is
not unreasonable.</LD>
<LD>   The consultant, in a report to be released today by the Local Agency
Formation Commission, nonetheless concludes that it is uncertain whether
San Pedro and Wilmington could cut spending enough to make cityhood
financially viable.</LD>
<LD>   The report done for the commission, the agency studying secession, is
expected to reiterate findings made in October that a harbor area city
might face a major budget deficit in its first three years, according to
officials at a Los Angeles City Council meeting Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The consulting firm Public Financial Management concluded then that
the harbor area generates $123.8 million annually in revenue, which is
$34 million less than it costs Los Angeles to provide services to the
area.</TE>
<TE>   But after that report was issued, the harbor secessionists proposed an
alternative structure of government that they said would cost $99 million
annually.</TE>
<TE>   The commission asked the consultant to look at other cities with
populations similar to the harbor area--about 146,900--to determine
whether the spending proposed for the harbor was reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, according to a source close to the report, said the
harbor city could expect to spend $673 per resident, compared with $655
per capita in Irvine, $496 in Carson, $374 in Pomona and $339 in Garden
Grove. Only Torrance and Los Angeles spend more per capita, $868 and
$794, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Many uncertainties remain about whether the harbor area could
accomplish the cuts, according to the report. There are legal constraints
and employee agreements it would have to honor. And a proposal that the
Sheriff's Department assume policing of the area assumes that the new
city could negotiate a contract at a greatly reduced price.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Executive Director Larry Calemine said Tuesday that the
cityhood proposal remains alive, despite the major financial hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine and the commission must decide by June 5 whether there is
enough evidence of financial viability to put the cityhood proposal on
the ballot in November, when a San Fernando Valley secession proposal may
also be decided by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are more than hopeful," said Andrew Mardesich of the Harbor Study
Foundation, which is pressing for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor secessionists propose a part-time mayor and council, along with
a full-time city manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have less bureaucracy. We wouldn't have the waste that you
see with the city of Los Angeles," Mardesich said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, a commission member who
opposes secession, said she does not object to the agency considering the
alternative harbor area budget.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are saying is: Don't apply big-city economics to a small
city by just giving them a proportional share of our budget," Miscikowski
said. "I think it's a reasonable approach to say, 'Let's look at it
differently.' "</TE>

<LD>Like so many errant parachute jumps, the trip down was fine, but
the landing ended badly.</LD>
<LD>   About 2 a.m. Tuesday, police said, Robert Tompkins leaped from the
roof of a 37-story building in the 1100 block of Wilshire Boulevard. His
parachute opened on cue, and he floated gently down. But he landed on top
of a police car.</LD>
<LD>   Tompkins, 29, was promptly arrested and booked on suspicion of
trespassing.</LD>
<TE>   The police were there because Tompkins apparently tripped an alarm
while on the roof.</TE>

<HD>Candidates for Sheriff Attack Baca at Debate</HD>
<DH>Politics: The two sergeants mostly agree on plans for the
department while criticizing their boss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two candidates hoping to replace Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee
Baca faced each other Tuesday evening in what was expected to be the one
and only debate before the March 5 election. The only missing person was
the incumbent.</LD>
<LD>   Baca backed out of the event at East Los Angeles College last week and
has said he will not debate his two sergeants, Patrick Gomez and John
Stites. The sheriff spent Tuesday evening in Sacramento, attending Gov.
Gray Davis' State of the State speech.</LD>
<LD>   Gomez and Stites, meanwhile, wasted no time bashing their boss for
what they say are his weak leadership abilities and poor budgetary
decisions. Both called for audits of the department, more flexible work
schedules and a revamped promotional policy.</LD>
<TE>   They criticized their boss for what they called his nontraditional
programs, such as a recovery program for domestic violence offenders and
his proposal for a women's jail that would allow infants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're catering to these inmates," Gomez said. "These are people who .
. . shouldn't be in this resort, park-like atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez ran against Baca four years ago and received 12% of the vote. He
is assigned to the training division and works at the Inmate Reception
Center at Men's Central Jail. He has worked for the department for 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   Stites, who ran against former Sheriff Sherman Block in 1994 and
garnered 7% of the vote, also took issue with Baca's spending and what he
called Baca's "social" programs. Stites is assigned to the court services
division at the El Monte Courthouse; he has worked for the department for
22 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to dissolve all these hand-holding units," Stites said,
adding that he would take all deputies working in nontraditional jobs and
place them back on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute forum was held by the 6,600-member Los Angeles County
Professional Peace Officers Assn., which includes active and retired
members of the sheriff's department and the District Attorney's Office.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's campaign manager, Parke Skelton, had said that the sheriff
initially believed that the peace officers group was holding a private
endorsement interview and that he did not want to participate in a group
debate.</TE>
<TE>   The two sergeants mostly agreed on their proposals for the department,
and they saved their attacks for their boss, not each other.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they frequently said, "As John said," or "Like Patrick said"
in answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's challengers are not the only ones who have taken aim at the
sheriff for his spending habits. The Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors has raised concerns about Baca spending more than $25 million
over his approved budget at a time when he also purchased a $2.4-million
airplane.</TE>
<TE>   As an independently elected official, the sheriff has full control
over the department's staffing and policies. But the supervisors control
the sheriff's budgets and approve lawsuit settlements.</TE>

<HD>Monterey Park Council Feud Escalates in Suit Over Bus Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is nothing quite like a political family feud Monterey
Park-style.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council is being sued by one of its own, who is seeking to
void a $1.5-million bus contract because he alleges that another
councilman works for that company's owner.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Benjamin "Frank" Venti has filed a lawsuit against the city
asking a Pasadena Superior Court judge to issue an injunction voiding a
bus contract awarded to Parking Concepts Inc. in October by council
members.</LD>
<TE>   Venti contends that the contract violates state law because Councilman
Fred Balderrama has a financial interest in it because he is employed by
a firm owned by Parking Concepts' owner, Gill Barnett.</TE>
<TE>   While Balderrama did not vote to approve the contract, the suit filed
Friday alleges that he did influence the process with staff and
colleagues. The suit contends that violates a state statute designed to
prohibit the appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also seeks to remove Balderrama, an 11-year incumbent, from
office and forbid him to hold any elected position in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "What Fred and the city did here just doesn't sit right with me,"
Venti said. "I felt so uncomfortable with it I had to go to court. I gave
them several opportunities to rectify it."</TE>
<TE>   Balderrama would not comment on the suit, which names him, the city
and the company as defendants. But prior to its filing, Balderrama had
said accusations over the contract were unfounded and politically
motivated. "Everybody has known me for all these years. They know that
I've always abstained from everything that could be a conflict," he said
in a November interview.</TE>
<TE>   Balderrama did not participate in the 2-1 vote last Oct. 3 to approve
the contract with Parking Concepts. City lawyers informed Balderrama that
he should not participate in the vote as it would warrant a conflict of
interest under the Political Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett had hired Balderrama in October 2000 and in August 2001
Barnett started a new company, PCI Fleet Maintenance, which is managed by
the councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Monterey Park City Atty. Anthony Canzoneri said that since Balderrama
worked for PCI, and not Parking Concepts, he did not have a financial
interest in the contract approved in October.</TE>
<TE>   But Venti's suit argues that Balderrama was still an employee of
Barnett and stood to gain from the awarding of the bus contract.</TE>
<TE>   Venti's lawyers add that Balderrama last June also addressed the West
Covina City Council on behalf of Parking Concepts. The suit contends that
the councilman's move to PCI Fleet Maintenance was part of a conspiracy
to cover up his financial interest. Barnett did not return telephone
calls Tuesday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation for Monterey Park to hire Parking Concepts came in
September 2001 from Amy Ho, a city transportation manager. The company
had submitted the lowest bid.</TE>
<TE>   Ho, in an interview, said Balderrama had given her a Parking Concepts
business card sometime in 2000 identifying him as a vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Canzoneri said there was nothing unusual in the councilman giving a
staffer his business card and it occurred months before any bids were
submitted.</TE>
<TE>   But City Treasurer Mitchell Ing said Balderrama's connections raise
concerns. "There is a motive to everything he does, and that is personal
gain," Ing said of Balderrama.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman in turn characterizes the treasurer as trying to use
the issue as platform for a council bid. Venti and Ing are longtime
political foes of Balderrama.</TE>
<TE>   The council approved Ho's recommendation in October on a 2-1 vote.
Balderrama recused himself and one of the five council seats was vacant
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that vote violated a law that requires a majority of
the five-member body to approve all expenditures. Canzoneri said that
majority is only needed to pay out on contracts, not to agree to them.</TE>
<TE>   But Venti's attorney, Gregory Moser, said that by signing a contract,
a city is agreeing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want a court to decide," Venti said.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Coleman Swart is scheduled to hear the case July 3.</TE>

<HD>New Campus for School Rejected</HD>
<DH>Education: Sierra Madre council votes down project, ending two-year
debate over growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The feisty little city of Sierra Madre--a San Gabriel Valley town
without a traffic signal and devoid of fast-food drive-thrus--has issued
its most recent no verdict, denying a Christian high school's request to
build a new campus.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted 3 to 1 against a long-studied proposal by
Maranatha High School to build a campus on mountainside property once
owned by city founder Nathaniel Carter.</LD>
<LD>   While the vote ends a two-year debate--which included a campaign that
sprouted hundreds of lawn signs on both sides of the issue--the high
school's resolve to build on an 8.5-acre parcel of its 63 acres is not
squashed.</LD>
<TE>   Maranatha attorneys have already sent Sierra Madre a letter laying the
groundwork for a legal challenge. They believe the denial, in part,
deprives them of religious freedom under a powerful new federal law that
is designed to protect religious institutions from zoning and historic
landmark laws.</TE>
<TE>   The land in question is zoned for houses. The school was seeking a
zoning change from the city to build the campus, about 100,000 square
feet of construction that would have included classrooms, a gymnasium,
theater and playing fields.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which scaled down its original proposal in light of
community concerns, would have left the vast majority of the land as open
space and allowed public access to hiking trails.</TE>
<TE>   But in a resolution denying the zoning change, City Council members
said the project would cause severe traffic problems at several key
intersections and would make noise "much like an echo chamber" that would
disturb the surrounding neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The council also cited the removal of irreplaceable trees and the lack
of adequate parking as additional reasons for denial.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the traffic would have been particularly bad when
dropping off students," said Councilman Doug Hayes, who voted no. "I
voted for what is best for the property. And I still feel residential is
best." Also voting no were Mayor Glenn Lambdin and Councilman Robert
Stockly.</TE>
<TE>   There is a growing movement in Sierra Madre to try to raise funds from
government and conservancy sources to buy the land from Maranatha and
preserve it as a park.</TE>
<TE>   But the $4.5-million parcel is not for sale, said Principal John
Rouse.</TE>
<TE>   Maranatha is a strict prep school where students study the Bible along
with academics. Its 20-year campus lease with the Pasadena Unified School
District expires in September. The district plans to reclaim the campus
for interim classroom space.</TE>
<TE>   Rouse said Maranatha is looking for a temporary site for the fall, a
difficult task because it does not want to move more than five miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Bart Doyle cast the lone yes vote, saying that the school's
plan to preserve open space was a good one for the city. Councilwoman
Kris Miller-Fisher recused herself because she owns property nearby.</TE>

<LD>Incorrect directions - In the Chocolate Truffle Cake that ran as
part of the "Top 10 Recipes" (Jan. 2), you need to make 10 ganache balls
rather than the five called for. Here is the correct recipe.</LD>
<TE>Chocolate Truffle Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes plus
1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>  \o7  This recipe from French Laundry chef Thomas Keller's March 7
"Professional Help" column is almost more of a molten-centered chocolate
souffle than a cake. The batter can be prepared up to 1 hour ahead and
left at room temperature to be baked at the last minute. Or you can make
it even more in advance, freeze it, then pop it straight into the oven.
The baking time in that case will increase to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>\f7    *</TE>
<TE>   GANACHE</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces semisweet chocolate</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Grate the chocolate and place it in a bowl. Bring the whipping cream
just to a boil and pour it over the chocolate. Slowly stir until smooth.
Transfer the mixture into a shallow glass dish and let it cool slightly,
about 10 minutes, then place it in the freezer to chill, 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scoop out 10 balls using a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon and shape them
so they're round. Chill until ready to use.</TE>

<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   14 ounces bittersweet chocolate</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon flour</TE>
<TE>   10 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   7 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Powdered sugar, for dusting</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set over,
but not touching, simmering water. Stir in the flour and remove from the
heat to cool slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer and slowly add the
sugar until the whisk leaves a thick ribbon that stays on top of the
batter when it is lifted out, about 5 minutes. Pour the chocolate into
the yolk-sugar mixture and gently fold them together.</TE>
<TE>   Spray 10 (1/2-cup) ramekins with cooking spray. Half-fill each with
chocolate batter, place 1 ganache ball in the center and then continue
filling to the top with more batter. Place the ramekins on a rimmed
baking sheet. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point up to 1 hour in
advance and stored at room temperature, or 1 week in advance and frozen,
tightly covered.)</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cakes until they begin to pull away from the sides of the
ramekins, 13 to 15 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.</TE>

<HD>No Charges Filed in Bell Gardens Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Politics: Questions remain despite end of probe into ex-official's
contention that mayor hit him with SUV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly seven months after a former Bell Gardens city councilman
alleged that the mayor had tried to run him down with a vehicle, an
investigation has ended with no criminal charges filed.</LD>
<LD>   But the issue refuses to die, as the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office and Sheriff's Department feud over the handling of the
probe, and residents complain that questions remain unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   The case's lead prosecutor and sheriff's investigator agree that
insufficient evidence has been found to charge Mayor Ramiro Morales with
deliberately striking former councilman Rogelio Rodriguez with his SUV
last June.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez contended that he suffered a severely bruised shoulder when
he was hit by the side-view mirror of Morales' SUV as he left the City
Hall parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   But although Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Wilson wants further
investigation into hit-and-run allegations, the lead investigator on the
case said none is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is the old Joe Friday thing. Just give them the facts,"
said Sgt. Thomas Thomas of the Sheriff's Department's traffic services
unit. "If [Wilson] can't string a hit-and-run from that, then I don't
think even Sherlock Holmes can."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, however, said that Thomas' report was incomplete, and that he
decided reluctantly to close the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it merited further investigation to determine why the mayor
left . . . the scene of an injury caused by a car," Wilson said. "Maybe
[Thomas] should think about what else may be involved."</TE>
<TE>   The incident in June had capped a tense day at City Hall, where
residents had gathered to demonstrate against then-City Manager Maria
Chacon, who had just been charged with conflict-of-interest violations.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation occurred when Morales, a Chacon supporter, was
leaving the City Hall parking lot and encountered an anti-Chacon group
that included Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said Morales gunned the engine of his sport-utility vehicle
and bolted forward, striking Rodriguez so hard that the side-view mirror
was torn from the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   But Morales said Rodriguez stiff-armed the mirror intentionally.
Morales told investigators that he left the scene because he feared the
protesters.</TE>
<TE>   The probe was handled by the Sheriff's Department at the request of
Bell Gardens Police Chief Manuel Ortega, who wanted an outside agency
involved because of the political nature of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Wilson concluded that there was insufficient evidence to
charge Morales with assault with a deadly weapon. A study determined that
the vehicle was traveling at less than 5 mph, making it unlikely that
Morales acted deliberately, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't consider it a hit-and-run case because the mayor
called police within 10 minutes of leaving the scene. But Wilson said
drivers are obligated to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's supporters expressed frustration Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's not doing their job well," said Rodriguez's daughter,
Jennifer. "This is a serious case. It's not something that you leave
floating like that."</TE>

<HD>Preserve District Is Backed</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Supervisors support creating an entity for buying
and setting aside undeveloped land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously
backed creation of a land conservation district, clearing the way for
local voters to weigh in on the issue on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will decide whether Ventura County should join a growing list
of counties seeking to prevent urban sprawl by buying up undeveloped land
for permanent preservation.</LD>
<LD>   Even more critical, voters will be asked to tax themselves to pay for
the land purchases, either through a sales tax increase or a property
assessment.</LD>
<TE>   After three years of debate and several delays, open-space supporters
applauded county policymakers for using their clout to bring the district
closer to reality.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to take a giant step forward today," said Roma Armbrust,
a Ventura environmental advocate. "This will be a great opportunity for
everyone in Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels dropped earlier opposition to the plan after
board members assured her that they did not intend to create the district
without a public vote.</TE>
<TE>   That requirement also was made by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson
(D-Santa Barbara), who has agreed to carry the legislation necessary to
place the issue before local voters.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said she is pleased that her colleagues agreed to create an
advisory committee to help define the district's goals and land-purchase
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The broad-based committee will be made up of representatives from the
county, its 10 cities, environmental groups and the business community.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing more critical than having voter buy-in for the
long-term success of this district," Mikels said. "I am extremely pleased
to be able to move this forward in a way that I am comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors split on who should pay the estimated $416,000 cost of
preparing the ballot measure and hiring consultants to advise on it.</TE>
<TE>   On a 3-2 vote, with Supervisors John Flynn and Steve Bennett
dissenting, the board postponed that decision until its summer budget
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers supported creation of a district, calling it the best
way to preserve the county's semi-rural feel.</TE>
<TE>   The SOAR anti-sprawl initiatives protect much of the county from
development, but those laws will begin to expire in 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of organizations prepared to help educate the
public in the benefits of this district," said Mark Burley, member of the
county's SOAR growth-control group.</TE>
<TE>   Even groups that have previously opposed growth restrictions appeared
to accept that a conservation district may soon become reality. They are
now focusing on ways to create the district so that some development can
still occur.</TE>

<HD>Cheerleading Squad Picks Decided</HD>
<DH>School: Newport Harbor High will stick to those selected by judges
in November. Some parents threaten to sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Harbor High School officials said Tuesday that they have
finally decided which girls deserve a spot on the cheerleading squad:
Only those who were picked by a panel of judges six weeks ago will be
guaranteed a place.</LD>
<LD>   The question of who should be on the team has riveted the town of
Newport Beach and been the subject of an increasingly bitter fight among
girls and their parents since some began complaining of inconsistencies
in judging after the Nov. 29 tryouts.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the dispute, Principal Michael Vossen had tried to resolve
matters by allowing all 48 girls who had tried out to be on the squad.
But on Tuesday, as many would-be cheerleaders dissolved into tears,
Vossen said he was going with the original squad of 30 but would hold
additional tryouts for four more spots.</LD>
<TE>   Practices, which had been suspended pending the outcome of the fight,
will resume today. The tryouts will be held soon.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision is the only fair one they could have come up with,"
said Michael Johnston, a parent of two cheerleaders who made the original
squad. Johnston filed a formal complaint with the district protesting the
principal's first solution of putting all the girls on the team. He
pointed out that all the girls and their parents agreed in writing before
the tryouts to abide by the judges' decision.</TE>
<TE>   Other parents and cheerleaders disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not right," said Megan Romenello, who did not make the original
squad. Megan said she quit her job when she got the happy news in early
December that she would be a cheerleader after all. But she said she will
not be trying out again.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't go through the process of not making it again," she said.
"They've crushed a lot of girls."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Castellanos, assistant superintendent of secondary education for
the Newport Mesa Unified School District, acknowledged that the ups and
downs of the process have been painful for many girls.</TE>
<TE>   But if school officials hoped Tuesday's decision would resolve a
dispute that has pitted friends against each other and ruined the
holidays for many families, they were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   One mother whose daughter made the original squad said she intends to
file a complaint with the school district today, protesting the way the
administration handled the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you see all these girls crying?" said Sherry Blake, gesturing
around her as red-eyed girls collapsed in one another's arms or were led
away by their mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Another mother, Annette Kerr, said some parents are considering a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the first time the composition of the cheerleading
squad at the coastal campus ended up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Since a 1994 lawsuit in which the district paid tens of thousands of
dollars, the high school has gone to lengths to prevent controversy over
cheer tryouts. The judges are professionals from outside the school
district who don't know the girls. Just to make sure everything goes
smoothly, a certified public accountant tabulates the scores, watched
over by a representative from the League of Women Voters.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Killer's Dark Side Emerges in Records</HD>
<DH>Violence: Man believed to have shot wife, daughter and himself was
on probation for molesting the girl, court documents show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONA
</DL>
<LD>The patriarch of a Corona family, who police say shot his wife and
their 16-year-old daughter before killing himself early this week, was on
probation for committing lewd acts on the girl, court records show.</LD>
<LD>   Corona police said Tuesday that they believe Hamdy Elrakabawy, 51,
killed his 44-year-old wife, LAPD Officer Nancy Walden, and his daughter,
Camellia Elrakabawy, about dawn Monday and then turned the gun on
himself.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the couple had a history of domestic disputes.
"Something definitely was wrong," said Corona Police Lt. Roy
Vanderkallen.</LD>
<TE>   Walden and Camellia each were shot multiple times, police said, while
Elrakabawy was shot once in the head. A 9-millimeter Beretta handgun was
found on the floor next to him.</TE>
<TE>   On the outside, the family's life was a picture of suburban bliss.</TE>
<TE>   The three lived in a well-groomed Corona neighborhood. Their
Spanish-tiled, $260,000 home had a yellow Porsche convertible parked in
front. Walden and her husband recently added a pool in the backyard, and
they had handed out spare keys in the neighborhood in case anyone wanted
to let themselves in to take a dip.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the veneer, however, were darker lives.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's shootings occurred two years after Elrakabawy pleaded guilty
to three charges of lewd conduct with Camellia. The family apparently had
concealed from most friends and neighbors that Elrakabawy was still on
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Camellia Elrakabawy had recently passed the high school equivalency
exam and was preparing to leave for college, at least a year before most
of her peers.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to get out of that house," said Sherine Tate, a neighbor.
Camellia often baby-sat Tate's children, and once told Tate that her
father had been fondling her, Tate said.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved six years ago into the home on Donatello Drive, in a
south Corona tract near the mountains in Riverside County. They were
among the first residents of the newly built neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Camellia was then a quiet and bookish 10-year-old, friends and
neighbors say, and they watched with fondness as she grew up. Neighbors
placed friendly wagers on whether Camellia would become a diplomat or a
model.</TE>
<TE>   "She was becoming so beautiful," said Paula Rogers, who moved to the
neighborhood five years ago and hired Camellia regularly to baby-sit.
"She'd been a gangly, awkward kid, a geek, and she was just blossoming.</TE>
<TE>   About 4:30 a.m. Monday, neighbors heard Elrakabawy and Walden shouting
in the frontyard, police said. About 6 a.m., two neighborhood children
noticed that the front door of the home was ajar, and that the family's
three dogs had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The children poked their heads in the door to alert the family and saw
Elrakabawy lying at the foot of the stairs. Frightened, the children ran
off to school without telling anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Several hours later, Los Angeles Police Department officials contacted
Walden's relatives when she did not show up for work. The relatives went
to the home and found the three bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Camellia had been shot several times while seated at her computer.
Walden had been shot several times on the stairs. Elrakabawy had been
shot once in the head, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies are planned.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Elrakabawy was arrested in December 1999
and charged with two counts of performing a lewd act on a child and three
counts of lewd conduct.</TE>
<TE>   The lewd acts took place between June and November 1999, the records
show.</TE>
<TE>   After pleading guilty to the three counts of lewd conduct, he was
sentenced to five years' probation, including 100 days in the Riverside
County Sheriff's Department work program--which he was unable to complete
because he had a heart attack in the fall of 2000, records indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Among other provisions, Elrakabawy was ordered not to have any more
"negative contact" with his daughter. He was told not to spend
unsupervised time with any children, except his daughter. The prosecutor
and defense attorney in the case did not return phone calls seeking
comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Elrakabawy, an aerospace engineer who was born in Egypt, had told
friends and neighbors that he had been harassed at his Orange County
office since Sept. 11 because of his Middle Eastern heritage and his
thick accent.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have been on edge," said Susan Hale, a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Walden was remembered as a dedicated police officer
and a role model for young women.</TE>
<TE>   Walden had served in the Army for 20 years, and apparently met
Elrakabawy overseas, friends said. She joined the LAPD six years ago and
worked in the Harbor and Southeast divisions before joining the bus
transit division, where she patrolled public transit facilities such as
bus stops.</TE>
<TE>   Walden was a skilled helicopter pilot in the National Guard and was
looking forward to leaving for Germany next week on a training mission,
said LAPD Officer Jack Richter, one of her former partners.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, Richter was scheduled to run a 6-mile leg of an annual
Baker-to-Las Vegas footrace that draws law enforcement teams from across
the country. When he hurt his knee, he turned to Walden.</TE>
<TE>   "She said: 'Run in the desert? At 4 o'clock in the morning? Sure, I'll
do it,' " Richter said. "That was the kind of person she was. She was
first-class."</TE>

<HD>Trial of Rocket Scientists Delayed</HD>
<DH>Court: Defense seeks removal of judge, who once helped a
prosecution witness hire an attorney to sue Rocketdyne.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two months of testimony, a federal judge in Riverside
suspended the criminal trial of two former Rocketdyne scientists Tuesday
to resolve a motion to disqualify him.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Timlin delayed the trial of Edgar R.
Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth and Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash.,
who are charged with federal environmental crimes stemming from a 1994
explosion that killed two men at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field
Laboratory near Chatsworth.</LD>
<LD>   The motion was filed by defense lawyers after they learned that the
judge had helped a prosecution witness hire an attorney to sue
Rocketdyne.</LD>
<TE>   The information was brought forward last week by Assistant U.S. Atty.
William Carter. He informed defense lawyers that Timlin had recommended
an attorney who sued Rocketdyne on behalf of Judy Heiney, the widow of
chemical engineer Otto K. Heiney, 53, who was killed in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Heiney was expected to testify this week about conversations with her
husband about waste disposal practices at Rocketdyne's field lab. Before
the trial, Timlin ruled that Heiney could offer evidence about her
husband's growing frustration with what she has called "stupid
environmental rules" and how Rocketdyne could "get around" them.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyers Leonard Sharenow and John D. Vandevelde asked
Timlin to recuse himself Tuesday and declare a mistrial. After court,
Sharenow said he regrets having to disrupt the trial, but there could be
an appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor objected to the motion. "We believe that Judge Timlin
can continue to be a fair and impartial judge," said Thom Mzorek,
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The motion was referred to another judge, Virginia Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown how long the trial will be delayed. Jurors were sent
home Tuesday and told they would be contacted when needed.</TE>
<TE>   In court Thursday, Timlin said he did not make the connection between
the 1994 referral and the current criminal case, which began five years
later, until Carter mentioned it Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He said his former secretary at the state appellate court, Ethel
Barton, asked him for the name of a lawyer who could represent her niece
in a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against Rocketdyne. Shortly thereafter,
Timlin was appointed to the federal bench and got a new secretary.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested a lawyer to Barton, Timlin said, but has "never spoken to
nor seen" Heiney.</TE>
<TE>   "It has in no way affected me in the rulings I have made," the judge
said.</TE>

<HD>Charges Dropped, Ex-Convict Seeks to Rebuild Life</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors say the 1999 holdup in Anaheim was probably
committed by another man, who has admitted his guilt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors on Tuesday dismissed all charges against
a man who spent two years in prison for a robbery that officials now
believe was probably committed by another man.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came amid mounting evidence that George Lopez had nothing
to do with the May 1999 robbery of an Anaheim loan office. Two of the
robbery victims said Lopez wasn't the gunman, and another man said that
he--and not Lopez--committed the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal marks the fifth time in two years that the Orange County
district attorney's office has dropped charges against convicted felons
after new evidence came up. In 2000, a man who served 20 years in prison
in the killing of a fast-food restaurant manager was set free when
witnesses cast doubt on his guilt. Eight months later, prosecutors
released another man amid doubts that he committed two robberies. Last
year, prosecutors struck down two other robbery convictions after
subsequent investigations found they were not guilty.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez's case, like the previous four, was based in large part on
witness identification testimony. He was arrested in August 1999 after
one victim of a robbery at Commercial Credit Corp. said he looked like
the man who robbed him.</TE>
<TE>   The jury that convicted Lopez in February 2000 never heard that two
other victims thought he was not guilty, nor did they learn that another
man pleaded guilty to committing three other nearly identical robberies
the same week. That man, Johnny SantaCruz, told The Times in July that he
committed the Anaheim robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence prompted a judge in September to free Lopez while he
decided whether to grant a new trial. After their own investigation,
prosecutors filed a motion Tuesday asking Judge Daniel Didier to drop the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian Gurwitz would not detail what the district
attorney's investigation found but said he took the action "because the
newly discovered evidence has cast enough doubt on whether Lopez was the
gunman."</TE>
<TE>   "The interests of justice are best served by vacating the
convictions," Gurwitz added.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was running an errand when his wife called with the news
Tuesday. "I'm so happy, words can't even explain it," Lopez said. "I have
my life now. I'm so excited I feel like jumping up and screaming."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's appeals lawyer, James Crawford, added: "The system, it just
broke down. Everybody from the defense to the prosecution, nobody did
what they're supposed to do, before, during and after the trial."</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney should have dismissed the case once the
witnesses said George wasn't the gunman," he added.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Lopez spent the day helping his father sell a used car.
Because of his felony conviction, he has struggled to find a job since
his release from prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to go on with my life and forget about this thing and
pretend this never happened," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Lopez's wife and mother who pushed his case, in the media and
by raising money to hire an appeals lawyer. Although the initial
courtroom losses were frustrating, his mother, Tricia Lopez, said she was
thrilled by the district attorney's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got chills," she said. "I have no words. It was worth the fight.
I tried so hard and no one would give me the time of day. I'm just happy
my son is free, maybe now he can get on with his life. It brings tears to
my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Sources in the district attorney's office said prosecutors agreed to
dismiss the case in part because SantaCruz recently admitted to
investigators that he committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   SantaCruz and Lopez were arrested together four days after the robbery
when police searched the car in which they were riding and found a gun.
But SantaCruz later told The Times that this was the first time he had
seen Lopez and that Lopez didn't know the gun was in the car. SantaCruz
insisted that Lopez had no involvement in the robberies.</TE>
<TE>   'He didn't do it. . . . He's innocent," SantaCruz said in July. "I saw
an opportunity. I was going to take their money."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities charged Lopez with armed robbery when one of the victims
at the loan office identified his photo.</TE>
<TE>   But during the trial, two of the victims told the prosecutor outside
of court that they didn't believe Lopez was the gunman. The prosecutor
passed along the statement to Lopez's defense lawyer, who chose not to
ask them to testify about their doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the outcome of the Lopez case underscores the
fragile nature of eyewitness identification testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Romney, a former prosecutor who is a professor at Western State
University School of Law, said recent publicity about wrongful
convictions is making the justice system more open to correcting its
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that more innocent people are being convicted, but rather
we're looking more closely at those cases," Romney said. "This is due in
large part to DNA evidence, which confirmed for prosecutors and defense
attorneys that these claims of innocence are more than sour grapes from a
convicted person."</TE>
<TE>   While the Lopez family prepared to celebrate Tuesday afternoon, Tricia
Lopez wondered whether her son and her family would ever recover.</TE>
<TE>   "They make a terrible mistake and then go on their merry way," she
said. "And I lose my son" for two years.</TE>
<TE>   George Lopez said he understands he's fortunate to be free. "Every day
I spend with my wife and son I cherish. I could get hit by a bus one day,
or look at what happened to me, I got convicted of something I didn't
do."</TE>

<LD>The feisty little city of Sierra Madre--a San Gabriel Valley town
without a traffic signal and devoid of fast-food drive-thrus--has issued
its most recent no verdict, denying a Christian high school's request to
build a new campus.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted 3 to 1 against a long-studied proposal by
Maranatha High School to build a campus on mountainside property zoned
for houses.</LD>
<LD>   While the vote ends a two-year debate--which included a campaign that
sprouted hundreds of lawn signs on both sides of the issue--the high
school's resolve to build on a 8.5-acre parcel of its 63 acres is not
squashed.</LD>
<TE>   Maranatha attorneys have already sent Sierra Madre a letter laying the
groundwork to file suit.</TE>

<HD>PUC Seeks OK to File New PG&amp;E Reorganization Plan</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Agency aims to keep the utility under its thumb,
halting effort to transfer transmission and generation facilities to new
corporate entities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>State utility regulators asked a federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday
for permission to file an alternative plan for reorganizing financially
ailing Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., saying it could reduce electricity
rates for millions of Northern and Central California consumers by early
2003.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission's plan would block PG&amp;E's
attempt to transfer generation and transmission facilities to new
corporate entities and would keep the utility's operations under PUC
regulation. It also calls for fully repaying the company's creditors
within a year.</LD>
<LD>   The PUC outlined its plan while opposing a PG&amp;E request to extend the
period during which its reorganization blueprint would be the sole one
considered in the case.</LD>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E has had nine months to be the only game in town," PUC President
Loretta M. Lynch said in Sacramento. "It is time to put out an
alternative that is less draconian."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, PG&amp;E said the PUC's action "is simply the latest in a
series of efforts to delay PG&amp;E's emergence from bankruptcy. The PUC,
whose actions and inactions were a major cause of the state's energy
crisis and PG&amp;E's bankruptcy, has tried to obstruct our efforts to
resolve the case."</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office and consumer groups have joined
the PUC in criticizing PG&amp;E's plan as an attempt to escape meaningful
state regulation to maximize its profits.</TE>
<TE>   In a court filing, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said PG&amp;E is trying to
skirt more than 40 state laws and regulations involving 155 state and
local agencies. He said alternative plans, such as the PUC's, deserve
consideration "if they provide full payments to PG&amp;E creditors without
interfering with the state's ability to protect the public health, safety
and welfare."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental Defense economist Nancy Ryan applauded the PUC's
proposal, saying it would provide better scrutiny of the environmental
impact of shifting PG&amp;E's hydroelectric facilities and watershed to
entities unregulated by the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   But Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in
Santa Monica said the PUC's plan amounted to a "bailout." He said it is
unfair that PG&amp;E customers would continue paying record electricity rates
for at least a year when wholesale prices have declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians are paying the highest rates in our history to cover
costs that no longer exist," Heller said. "The PUC [plan] is keeping
rates much higher than they should be, just so PG&amp;E can skim the money
off the top and pay back its debt."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors last April, saying
it had run up billions of dollars in debts because it could not collect
the full cost of supplying electricity to its customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company's reorganization plan will be the only one considered for
a specified period. PG&amp;E received an extension to Feb. 4, but has
requested another extension until June 30, citing the complexity and size
of the case involving more than 13,000 creditors and billions of dollars
in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC argues that PG&amp;E has failed to make substantial progress on
its plan, although the company has reached agreement with an official
committee of creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of parties have filed objections to PG&amp;E's disclosure
statement, and the PUC said the utility has not formally discussed its
plan with state regulators.</TE>

<LD>A 28-year-old Yemeni national detained after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks pleaded not guilty in federal court to five counts of immigration
and Social Security fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Bakarbashat, 28, is being held without bail. Each charge carries
a penalty of up to five years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Bakarbashat had phony green cards and altered Social Security cards,
said Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Wheat. He came to the attention of
federal authorities because he rented a room from a local Muslim leader,
who also allowed two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid
Almihdhar, to live in his home.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Convict Gets 6 Years for Hate Crime</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old ex-convict has been sentenced to six years in prison
after pleading guilty to committing a hate crime against a Jordanian
immigrant because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge A. Frank Brown gave the maximum sentence Monday
to Horatio Fernando Plascencia. "I think what you did was really evil,"
he said.</LD>
<LD>   Plascencia admitted that he battered Ahmad Numan, 33, and tried to
stab him with a screwdriver. The attack occurred at a gas station in the
Pacific Beach area of San Diego where Numan was a clerk.</LD>
<TE>   "This was not an act of patriotism," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Wendy
Patrick. "This was a hate crime."</TE>
<TE>   Numan, who quit his job because of the Nov. 18 attack, said he is
plagued by nightmares. "I dream he's going to come back to kill me," he
said. "My life has changed. I wish I could get back my normal life."</TE>
<TE>   Plascencia, who served time in prison for a 1991 robbery conviction,
admitted that he threatened to kill Numan unless he gave him a pack of
cigarettes. Plascencia asked Numan where he was from.</TE>
<TE>   When Numan said Jordan, Plascencia responded, "Then in that case I am
going to kill you" and accused Numan of being part of a terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   A hate-crime battery allegation carries a maximum sentence of three
years in prison. Because Plascencia had a prior felony conviction,
another three years was added, court officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Plascencia expressed remorse for the attack and blamed the fact that
he had downed six beers in the minutes before the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the first hate-crime allegation in San Diego County tied
to the Sept. 11 attacks, although several cases are being investigated.
In two cases--an assault on a female motorist and an attack on a man
outside a restaurant--officials have done re-creations for television in
hopes of finding witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Numan, who immigrated three years ago, said he is trying to keep the
incident from destroying his faith in America.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here, it was like a dream, everybody treated equal, not
like other places," he said. "I still want to believe that."</TE>

<LD>A national Latino organization said Tuesday that it is
investigating spending and hiring practices in Santa Barbara County,
which recently placed its top administrator on unpaid leave for alleged
insensitive remarks about Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   The League of United Latin American Citizens action comes after county
Administrator Mike Brown apologized for remarks that appeared to equate
Muslims with terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Dave Rodriguez, director of LULAC's Ventura and San Fernando Valley
offices, said that Brown's comments played a role in the decision to
investigate, but that there were other alleged incidents.</LD>

the accuracy of his results.</LD>
<LD>   George Goehring, who sold his business in July, has denied any
impropriety.</LD>
<LD>   Shasta County Dist. Atty. McGregor Scott is trying to decide whether
any of the 500 to 1,000 defendants that Goehring, 62, worked with were
sent to prison wrongfully.</LD>

<HD>Goebel Doesn't Fall Short Now</HD>
<DH>Men: Despite a mistake, he is tied with Eldredge after short
program. Weiss, in fifth, probably won't make team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago or even last year, had Tim Goebel fallen and skidded
in his short program as he did Tuesday at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships, he might have let his temper boil ever and ruined the
remainder of his routine.</LD>
<LD>   That he was able to laugh after stumbling to his knees on the ice at
Staples Center reflected how much he has grown--and, perhaps, that he's
prepared to defend his title and win a berth on the U.S. team for the
Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, shared first place with Todd
Eldredge after the short program, the first phase of the men's event.
Matt Savoie, last year's U.S. bronze medalist, was third, ahead of 2001
world junior champion Johnny Weir.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Weiss was fifth after a nightmarish program, virtually killing
his chances of winning one of three spots on the Olympic team. The men's
event will end Thursday with the long program, worth two-thirds of the
final score.</TE>
<TE>   Ties are rare in figure skating, but it was an equitable result for
Goebel and Eldredge. Although Goebel fell, he performed a more difficult
combination jump than Eldredge did, pulling off a quadruple
salchow-triple toe loop combination. Eldredge, trying for his third
Olympic team and first Olympic medal at 30, did a nice but relatively
easier triple axel-triple toe loop.</TE>
<TE>   "I never made that mistake in practice," Goebel said of his fall,
which he attributed to having more speed than he anticipated. "Other than
that little disaster, I think it was a good program. The jumps felt even
more comfortable than the Grand Prix Final.</TE>
<TE>   "On the whole, it probably was my best short program of the year. I'm
pleased to be feeling more comfortable at each competition."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, a five-time U.S. champion, said he couldn't help thinking as
he took his final bow Tuesday that it was the last short program he would
ever perform at the U.S. championships. His mind flashed back to the
first time he had competed at the national championships, so many years
and so many memories ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my last shot," said Eldredge, who made his debut on the
national scene as a novice-level competitor in 1983. "They've all been
different and they've all been great."</TE>
<TE>   His short program to "Carmina Burana" Tuesday was everything the
nerve-wracking, 2-minute, 40-second routine should be: well-paced,
energetic and free of flaws. It lacked only a quad, which he has landed
only twice in competition.</TE>
<TE>   He opted to do a triple axel-triple toe loop, and pulled it off with
good height and good form. "I told him I didn't want it done in the short
program," said his coach, Richard Callaghan. "As he said, you can lose in
the short program, and I wanted him to do whatever he needed to do to get
into contention for the long."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, however, went for a quadruple toe loop on the first part of his
combination, and it ended in a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss fell badly, and when he scrambled up, tacked on a double toe
loop instead of the planned triple. He followed with a triple axel that
tilted so badly sideways, he had to land it on two feet to avoid falling
again.</TE>
<TE>   His marks for the required elements ranged from 4.8 (out of 6.0) to
5.1. Even though his presentation scores were seven 5.7s and two 5.8s,
his Olympic hopes are in dire danger. Weiss, who lost about 13 pounds to
get into shape for this competition, can't be any lower than third in the
long program and must rank ahead of Matt Savoie and Johnny Weir on the
judges' scorecards for that program.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't make any sense of it," Weiss said of the botched combination.
"It's the first one I missed all week. ... I hit five of five I tried.
That's not a bad average. The only one I miss is in the short program.
There's no reason to take it out. I land them all the time and miss it in
the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to come back strong in the long program. I could easily win
the long program. I've got to hit the quad-triple and skate the way I've
been skating all week. I wanted to come in and win the short program and
I could have easily done that, and I let it get away."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge shifted around the ice a bit before settling on a place to
start, but later said he was merely looking for a place in the patched-up
surface that didn't have chips or snow on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember back four years ago, at Skate America, I fell on an ice
chip and dislocated my shoulder, so I didn't want to have that happen
again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His only wobble came on the landing of a triple lutz, one of the
required moves. However, he held onto the landing and emerged unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't win a competition in the short program, but you could lose
it," the 30-year-old Massachusetts native said. "I wanted to skate a
clean program and put myself in good position for Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   Savoie, who was third at last year's national competition, didn't try
a quad. However, his program to music from Cirque du Soleil was sharp and
lively. His marks for the required elements ranged from 5.5 to 5.8 and
for presentation, from 5.6 to 5.8.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel's coach, Frank Carroll, was probably less amused than his
student about the unexpected stumble, but he too took it in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dumb mistake to happen," Carroll said, "and let's hope it
doesn't happen again Thursday. ... I thought he skated very well. He did
the technical part very well, did a nice [triple] axel and a nice
combination. I'll take it. I thought it was damned good."</TE>

<HD>Somber Scouting Mission for Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Team visits site of World Trade Center tragedy and
remembers Bailey and Bavis, who died Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Dressed to ward off the winter chill on a bright, clear day in
lower Manhattan, their hearts in their throats, the Kings stood rapt
Tuesday at the site of the World Trade Center tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   John P. Codiglia, a deputy inspector for the New York Police
Department and their guide for the day, detailed the events of Sept. 11
and the aftermath. He told them of the recent discovery of the badly
decomposed body of a fallen comrade.</LD>
<LD>   Still dressed in police blues, Codiglia said, the officer had been
decapitated.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran winger Steve Heinze closed his eyes and bowed his head.</TE>
<TE>   Directly affected by the terrorist acts, which claimed the lives of
two of their scouts, the Kings spent part of their day at ground zero and
seemed overwhelmed by the death and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   They stopped at the impromptu memorials that surround the site,
quietly reading the messages and viewing the cards, flowers and other
keepsakes that have been left there, and they climbed a private platform
that overlooks what is now a 16-acre pit.</TE>
<TE>   Though the mood was mostly somber--voices tend to fall silent here--a
few players schmoozed with police, who jokingly asked them to take it
easy on their beloved New York Rangers in tonight's game at Madison
Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett "Ace" Bailey and Mark Bavis were not eulogized at the site of
their deaths, but the late scouts seemed to be on everybody's mind.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Ray Bennett, who'd brought a bottle of ice shavings
from Staples Center, sprinkled them onto the site as a memorial, an act
of remembrance suggested to him by Bill Gurney, the Kings' video
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill said they were trying to get to us [when they died]," Bennett
said of the scouts, "so we took a little bit of Staples Center to them."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, for seven years the Kings' director of pro scouting, and
Bavis, an amateur scout in his second season with the club, were en route
to Los Angeles when their hijacked flight from Boston was crashed into
the center's south tower.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Buchberger, who started his career with the Edmonton Oilers,
knew Bailey better than many of his teammates. Bailey, a former NHL
player, helped the Oilers to five Stanley Cup championships as an advance
scout.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a great man and very well-liked by everybody," Buchberger
said. "It's really hard to talk about it. When I was reading some of the
messages that young kids have left for their dads....</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to experience that again."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the Kings, the visit was a time of quiet reflection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just disturbing," said a subdued Mathieu Schneider, a native New
Yorker and usually the most loquacious of Kings. "The whole thing is
really incredible. It's nice to pay respects, but it's hard. It's hard."</TE>
<TE>   After a morning practice in Montclair, N.J., the Kings bused into
Manhattan early in the afternoon, a police escort ushering them the last
30 blocks or so and onto the periphery of the site. None in the traveling
party of about 45--players, coaches and broadcasters--had much to say as
they filed off the bus, or during their hour visit.</TE>
<TE>   They thought they needed to be there, though, no matter the pain.
Patches and stickers commemorating Bailey and Bavis were left for the
cleanup crew, and some of the officers who escorted them will be the
Kings' guests at tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more a responsibility coming down here, given the fact that we
lost Ace and Mark," Bryan Smolinski said. "But if anyone has a chance to
come down to see what's going on, they should do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's not the same as it was a couple months ago. It looks
like a big excavation site. But once you see all the memorials and start
putting the names and faces together and realize all the people that are
missing and see all the heart and soul that's going into cleaning up,
it's pretty tough."</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Andy Murray, "We've seen enough pictures on television to
know what to expect, but you become totally aware of the magnitude when
you're here. You see the pictures, hear the stories. I thought the police
officer did a great job of explaining things. Coming here was important."</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Storr thought so too.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw it on television, we saw what happened," the backup goaltender
said. "But to actually be in the place where it happened, it really hits
home. It makes it more real. You realize all the people that gave up
their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Hatless Tuesday, Storr had worn an "FDNY" baseball cap during Monday
night's 3-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything I can do to show respect," he said. "It's not just a cap to
me. It's something that allows me to show respect."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's visit was another.</TE>

<LD>They hound-ed him, hemmed him in, blocked his shot, altered his

Jordan seem human.</LD>
<LD>   And still the Clippers lost Tuesday to Jordan and the Washington

<TE>   The Clippers' loss was their 10th in 12 games away from Staples
Center, a growing source of frustration for the players and Coach Alvin
Gentry. The Clippers are 16-7 at home, but on the road they can't
re-create the confidence, enthusiasm and results they have displayed at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Holding Jordan to 18 points and nine-of-24 shooting was a poor
consolation prize, according to Gentry. After all, the Clippers failed to
slow Jones, who had a season-high 16 points, Hubert Davis (16 points) and
Chris Whitney (18).</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, winners of four consecutive and 13 of their last 15,
erased a 10-point deficit, built a 12-point lead in the second half and
raced away when the Clippers got within 79-77 after Eric Piatkowski's
three-point basket late.</TE>
<TE>   Down the stretch, Whitney had eight points and Jones had six and drew
a key offensive foul against Clipper guard Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, Gentry refused to use injury or illness as an excuse
for the Clippers' second consecutive loss to start this six-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the Clippers lost Lamar Odom to stomach flu in the
first half, Michael Olowokandi did not play in the fourth quarter because
of a bruised right forearm and Elton Brand continued to be troubled by a
sore right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McInnis led the Clippers with a season-high 27 points. Brand had
17 points and 11 rebounds and Corey Maggette had 10 points, but no one
else scored in double figures for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not played with the energy I'd like to see on the road,"
Gentry said. "We're a completely different team on the road. We have to
find a way to play with the same energy and confidence we do at home.
That's what playoff teams do. I see it as our biggest problem.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my job. I've got to get it fixed. Be it personnel or what
we're doing, I was hired to fix that. I've got to find a way to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was just getting started on a postgame rant.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to find a way to play at a consistent level," he said.
"Playing close isn't good enough. Michael was nine for 24. That's all you
can hope for. Michael didn't beat us. The other guys stepped up and
played great."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are still searching for someone--anyone--to lead the team
on the road. No question, it's happened at home on occasion, when Brand,
McInnis, Odom or Richardson has made a key play at a pivotal moment.
McInnis' three-point basket with 1.5 seconds left that lifted the
Clippers over Milwaukee on Saturday stands out.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers haven't had a go-to guy on the road, although
Richardson did lead them to a victory over the Suns with 11 points in the
four quarter Dec. 18 at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're at Staples, we have fun," said Darius Miles, a 20-year-old
forward. "When we're on the road, it's not so much fun. We're trying. Me
and 'Q' [Richardson] jump around and bump chest. We try to do anything we
can. I guess it's not working. I'd like to see us win three games on this
trip and we've already lost two."</TE>
<TE>   So what's the answer?</TE>
<TE>   Gentry sounded as if his patience has run out.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are the league's youngest team, with an average age of
24.8. In time, they might learn how to win games away from the familiar
surroundings at Staples. But Gentry won't use his team's inexperience as
an excuse for their lapses in intensity and execution on the road.</TE>
<TE>   A difficult road schedule, which has the team playing four games in
four cities in five nights, also won't fly with Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "The great teams in this league walked into Boston Garden or Madison
Square Garden and they knew it was going to be a totally hostile
environment," he said. "You've got to want to step into that arena and
prove something. We played Michael Jordan here and I thought it would
have given us a chance to do something special."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Clippers got Jordaned Tuesday night. In the old days that would
mean they got sliced up and humiliated. These days it simply means they
lost to a player and a team that out-thought them and out-worked them, to
a player and a team that won with whatever limited means they had at
their disposal.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Wizards' 96-88 victory represented the evolution of
Michael Jordan. And it should be the ultimate destination for the
Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   While the Clippers produced the highlights, with soaring alley-oop
dunks by Corey Maggette and Darius Miles, Jordan and the Wizards stuck to
the basics--the stuff coaches talk about--like dictating tempo and
executing the offense.</LD>
<TE>   "We found a way to win the game tonight," Jordan said. "It wasn't a
pretty win."</TE>
<TE>   The only fans who left the MCI Center with some memorable Jordan
moments tucked away were the lucky ones who won the "Ultimate Jordan" DVD
in a promotion. Very little he does these days makes you pick up the
cellie and call your friends.</TE>
<TE>   Even his 51-point game against the Charlotte Hornets wasn't
jaw-dropping. Just a bunch of jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's effort was inspiring only if the Clippers were paying close
attention. He missed 15 of his 24 shots and missed his only free throw
(off a technical foul) and finished with 18 points.. But he had 10
rebounds and kept finding his teammates for open shots, and was only two
assists shy of a triple double. He keeps finding ways to win.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lamar Odom hit his first two shots--over Jordan--then
missed his next four and checked out of the game for good late in the
second quarter because of stomach flu. For a player that Coach Alvin
Gentry described as being as valuable to the Clippers as Jordan is to the
Wizards, it was not a very Jordanesque performance. As we all remember,
Jordan put together one of his most memorable games while battling
flu-like symptoms in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals. He scored 29 points
against the Chicago Bulls on Friday despite a sinus infection.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, he played in his first game since the news broke that his
wife, Juanita, has filed for a divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, when you have personal issues, it can drain you," Jordan
said. "Sometimes work is an avenue to deal with it and move on. That's
basically where I am right now. I come out and do my job and focus on
what's been enjoyable for me, which is playing basketball, and things
will work out for me in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the divorce after the game, Jordan said: "I don't
think I want to talk about my personal life. That's something that
privately we will work on.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I want to sit here and go through that. We have kids,
obviously, and we want to make sure that that's the focus."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, the once-lowly Wizards are Jordan's immediate
family. After a 3-10 start they have won 15 of 19 and look more like
legitimate playoff contenders every day. They have a winning record on
the road, something the Clippers can only dream about.</TE>
<TE>   They're moving on without injured starters Richard Hamilton and
Christian Laettner, and they're winning with guys such as Popeye Jones,
Hubert Davis, Brendan Haywood and former Laker Tyronn Lue doing the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, in the words of an NBA scout sitting courtside at MCI
Center, "If they make the playoffs, he's hands down the MVP of the
league."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan didn't bring his old game to the Wizards, but he brought the
same old attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a real bravado, in terms of they just believe with him out
there," Wizard Coach Doug Collins said. "Did you ever see that movie 'My
Bodyguard'? The kid in class is getting knocked around and then the bully
walks with him, pretty soon the kid gets a little swagger. [Jordan]
uplifts every player. And what he does is, he brings out the best in
Chris Whitney, he brings out the best in Hubert Davis, Popeye and all
these other players."</TE>
<TE>   Although eight players on the Clippers' roster entered the league
after Jordan retired before the 1999 season, Maggette, Quentin Richardson
and Miles had all played with Jordan in the summer. (They also all happen
to wear Air Jordan shoes now, and Miles took time during a free throw to
ask the CEO of Brand Jordan why they hadn't received the latest models).</TE>
<TE>   For Odom, it was a new experience.</TE>
<TE>   "He's Michael Jordan, man," Odom said. "Even if he didn't make a
basket, he's still Michael Jordan. He did a lot for the game, how we
play, how we even dress on the court, from the sneakers to [longer]
shorts."</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget about the sweatband worn high up the forearm.</TE>
<TE>   "I never rocked that," Odom said. "But Mike had a lot of style on the
court. And his demeanor. It's just amazing to be around him."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Clippers weren't too awestruck to learn a few things from
him as well.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, I thought this matchup would provide a nice contrast
because the Clippers are a young, athletic team and the Wizards are ...</TE>
<TE>   "What are you going to say, we're the old [team]?" Jordan said. "No,
they're very young and very athletic. And we're not as athletic and not
maybe as young, too, but there's two ways of winning games. Sometimes
it's not athletically. You've got to use your mind to some degree."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan uses his to a high degree. It's why he's still winning, even
with his 39th birthday just a little more than a month away.</TE>

<HD>It's Lakers in Pout, er, Rout</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal complains about officiating after 121-92
victory over Pistons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>You get the feeling Shaquille O'Neal would love to feel good about
this, about the Lakers winning five in a row, the last three by margins
of 32, 20 and 29 points.</LD>
<LD>   You get the feeling he would love to smile and slap Kobe Bryant in the
back of the head and slap Phil Jackson on the front of the head and
saunter off to the bus, roll off to the next place and do the same thing
to the next team.</LD>
<LD>   But, you know, things bother him. They shouldn't, of course. They just
do.</LD>
<TE>   And so, half an hour after the Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons,
121-92, Tuesday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where he scored 28
points in 25 minutes and Bryant scored 20 in 28, O'Neal sighed at a
league that won't let him be him.</TE>
<TE>   He played barely 30 minutes on average in three games off the injured
list, perhaps saving his feet months from now, but that didn't interest
him.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably doesn't matter," O'Neal said from his familiar postgame
pose, arms spread, head back, feet in a bucket of ice. "However, I'm
still good enough to get 25 and 10 [points and rebounds] in this
raggedy... league. I see now why they're losing money."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's beef, basically: two offensive fouls in the first quarter,
one drawn by rookie Zeljko Rebraca. So, Zeljko stays in the game, and
Shaq sits.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, it was better," he said. "It's got nothing to do with
the talent. It ain't the East. Got nothing to do with the East.... They
have to do that to even things up."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal at first insisted the only way he can be stopped is if he flat
misses.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, two ways," he said. "Cheat me or [beat] me. Other than that
..."</TE>
<TE>   If that didn't suck the joy out of the win for them, Robert Horry's
view might. The Lakers shot 51.7%, everyone but Horry scored, and by the
time they were halfway into the fourth quarter there were maybe 2,000
people in the arena. Bryant had a 360-degree dunk on a second-quarter
breakaway, and the rout was 20 points in the second quarter, 30 in the
third and 35 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons lost by 16 the night before, in Minneapolis. The Lakers
were in Detroit, quite possibly in their beds, long before the Pistons
were. In the postgame discussion of what made the victory, Horry
suggested it had more to do with who made the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "They just had a bad night," Horry said. "They looked tired. It was
them, tonight. They were terrible."</TE>
<TE>   There was that. But the Lakers can take the wind out of a town.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons sold out the arena they built in the middle of a pasture,
and they dressed their fans in red, white or blue, depending on the
section in which they sat. It was all very festive, right up until the
time they were behind by 20 points in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Piston forward Ben Wallace had a starburst thing going for his hair,
for the first nationally televised Piston game in two years. So
enthralled was TBS, by early in the fourth quarter it went happily to the
Memphis-Toronto game.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel we weren't really there," Detroit Coach Rick Carlisle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing takes the air out of a team like Bryant, on the break, going
airborne. Nothing kills the psyche of a team like O'Neal doing all of his
usual stuff, while mixing in the eight-foot turnarounds and making his
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored 39 points in the third quarter, their largest period
of the season, and they had a season-high 99 points after three quarters.
The bench scored 45 points, 11 in 13 minutes by Mitch Richmond. At the
same time, the Pistons looked every bit the team that has turned a 14-6
start into 16-17.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't keep the game interesting," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant took off his sweatband halfway through the fourth quarter and
sent a ballboy into the stands with it. The ballboy handed it to a young
man wearing a Bryant jersey and a ratty pair of Kobe shoes and the kid
nearly fell over with gratitude. He waved and Bryant winked.</TE>
<TE>   A season ago, in the same arena, Bryant signed an autograph during the
game for a fan who sat courtside.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said the 360 just came to him, that he never considered
Jackson's reaction had he missed, and that it merely proves that he is
over the rib ailment that slowed him for more than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We only come here once a year," he said. "People want to see that.
Plus, I'm healthy. When I'm healthy, I don't miss those, unless I'm
fouled."</TE>
<TE>   A locker room away, O'Neal huffed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To that blade-sharp heart, that sequined ego, that Cruella de Kwan,
I have only three words.</LD>
<LD>   You go, girl. Such is our greeting to the scarves and smirks of the
skating world, in town and all atwitter about the latest ice opera.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Kwan canned longtime coach Frank Carroll!</LD>
<TE>   Their Gipper dumped their Rockne!</TE>
<TE>   Less than three months before this week's national championships!</TE>
<TE>   The horror!</TE>
<TE>   The shame!</TE>
<TE>   The hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   Folks fret that skating championships are dominated by too many
pigtails and braces and immaturity.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when skating's most visible star makes a bold adult decision, they
scold her for not remaining a child.</TE>
<TE>   The way Kwan has been treated, you would have thought she had just
received a major misconduct for slashing her teddy bear. Hey, it wasn't
as if she took a lead pipe to the guy's knees or anything.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months ago, Kwan, who is 21, decided that her decade-long
association with Carroll wasn't working.</TE>
<TE>   The esteemed coach is considered one of the best in the history of the
sport. With him, Kwan had won five U.S. titles and four world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   But she didn't win the big one, finishing second in the 1998 Winter
Olympics to that ragamuffin Tara something-or-another.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years is a long time without winning the big one.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, despite his worldwide renown, Carroll has never won the big
one.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of coaches are fired in lots of places for not winning the big
one.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan kept Carroll for exactly as long as the Minnesota Vikings kept
Dennis Green.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Vikings were criticized for their patience, while Kwan is
being ripped for her petulance.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so football is not figure skating. So maybe that analogy is as
silly as comparing Sasha Cohen to a linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   But it unquestionably helps when the person doing the firing is a
male. Just ask Tiger Woods who, in March of 1999, fired popular caddie
Mike "Fluff" Cowan.</TE>
<TE>   The furor over that lasted about five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   People will be whispering about Kwan for five months.</TE>
<TE>   This, even though Kwan is grown up enough to earn about $5 million a
year in endorsements while behaving like a model citizen during her years
in the national spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   In the skating world, Kwan \o7 is \f7 Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Except when she makes a tough corporate decision, in which case, she's
a typical spoiled little girl, right?</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought it could be such a big deal," Kwan said Tuesday in a
news conference. "I mean, for me it was a big deal. But for outsiders, I
never thought it would be that big."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest deal, of course, is that she will compete in the Olympics
without a coach. Which has folks asking the question, has anyone ever won
an Olympic figure skating medal without a coach?</TE>
<TE>   The compelling answer is, nobody has a definitive answer.</TE>
<TE>   The coach's name doesn't appear in the record books. The coach doesn't
stand on the medal podium.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the coach runs absolutely no risk of falling on his
butt.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it has to be within," Kwan said. "It's just you and the ice.
No one can hold your hand."</TE>
<TE>   So who says Kwan can't win a gold medal without a coach? More
important, who says she shouldn't be allowed to try?</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this week, lots of folks are wondering why.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that the possible reasons for the firing are more
confusing than a Brian Boitano fast-food commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan won't say, exactly. She would rather catch flowers than sling
mud.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, verbally obliterating her former coach might make her look
bad in front of her sponsors, and where does that leave that $5 million?</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is trying to get inside my brain," Kwan said. "They can't do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Some say it's about the money. Isn't everything about the money?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she's tired of paying Carroll for something she thinks that, by
now, she can do herself. So big deal.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal parted ways with longtime agent Leonard Armato this
summer, and nobody plastered that split on the front page.</TE>
<TE>   Others say it's about love. Isn't everything also about love?</TE>
<TE>   She now has a boyfriend, a hockey player from the Florida Panthers.
I've never heard of the dude, but perhaps she wants to spend more time
cleaning his dentures. If so, good for her.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody gripes when male athletes make all sorts of seemingly odd
career decisions to spend more time with loved ones, from taking less
money during free agency to demanding trades to be closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Still others say she wants more control of her destiny. This wouldn't
be the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, remember, was the junior skater who took her senior test in 1992
and advanced into that level without Carroll knowing it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to one of the popular skating books by insider
Christine Brennan, the coach was out of town at the time and later
furious about the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan is also, remember, the one who last January fired her
choreographer, Lori Nichol, even though she was a Carroll protegee.</TE>
<TE>   Now that she's an adult, she's clearly taking control of her life, and
this is a bad thing?</TE>
<TE>   Some say that, yes, it is a bad thing because since leaving Carroll,
Kwan hasn't been the same skater.</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't looked as precise. She hasn't been as vibrant.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, maybe that's another part of growing up. Maybe she wants to
have more fun, no matter where she finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she's finally realized a truth that many of us never do, that
the journey is more important than the destination.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she dumped Carroll because she decided, no matter how she
finishes her Olympic career, she wanted to finish it her way.</TE>
<TE>   When a man named Frank Sinatra sang about that attitude, he was cool.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when a woman named Michelle Kwan sings it, she's callous?</TE>

<LD>  What: "Bud Greenspan's Favorite Stories of Winter Olympic Glory"</LD>
<LD>  Where: Showtime, Monday, 10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>  Bud Greenspan knows a few things about Olympic stories. The
award-winning sports historian has written, produced and directed eight
official Olympic films. The Salt Lake City Olympics will mark his ninth,
and the fourth he has done about the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>  This 90-minute documentary consists of seven Winter Olympic stories
that Greenspan rates as his favorites.</TE>
<TE>  The first segment is on Katarina Witt. No surprise here. Witt, who won
gold medals in figure skating at the 1984 and '88 Winter games, is the
favorite of many. Greenspan focuses on Witt's battle with Debi Thomas at
the '88 Calgary Games, with Witt and Thomas taking a look back.</TE>
<TE>  The other segments are mostly lesser-known stories. One focuses on ski
jumpers Espen Bredesen of Norway and Jens Weissflog of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Another is about Australian speedskater Colin Coates, who competed in
the 1968 Grenoble Games and made Australian Olympic history by finishing
sixth in the 10,000 meters at the 1976 Innsbruck Games. At 41, he also
competed in the 1988 Calgary Games, although he wasn't supposed to.</TE>
<TE>  Australian officials named him coach-manager of the speedskating team
and agreed to let him put his name on the roster as a potential
participant only so Coates could mingle on the ice with team members.
Australian officials were shocked to see him competing in the 10,000.</TE>
<TE>  There's a segment on American bobsledder Billy Fiske, who was killed as
a fighter pilot for the British Royal Air Force during World War II.
There's also a segment that focuses on the 40-kilometer cross-country
skiing relay at Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>  The other segments are on U.S. speedskater Jack Shea, and the British
ice dancing team of Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean.</TE>

<HD>He Figures Out Skating Without a Vested Interest</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I decided to sashay on down to Staples Center on Tuesday because I
wasn't sure we've had enough stories lately in the newspaper about figure
skating.</LD>
<LD>   I had to go to the Biltmore to pick up a press pass, officials there
offering me a snazzy figure skating vest, an obvious bribe that would
have convinced me to write only good things about this silly sport, but
Sports Editor Bill Dwyre has this policy that no one is allowed to accept
snazzy figure skating vests. Note to the Dodgers: I presume color TVs,
Ford Expeditions and Rolex watches are all right.</LD>
<LD>   "Tell your boss he's a big meanie," said Nancy Izuel, talking as if
she was breaking new ground here while passing out vests. Then she
noticed my name tag and just snapped: "You're the guy who is always
writing bad things about USC in the paper," she said, while slugging me
in the arm.</LD>
<TE>   I took down Ben Nagano's name as a witness for when I get around to
pressing charges against Izuel, and went to Staples to find eight police
officers on alert at the main entrance. I was hoping they were there to
stop me from going inside, but apparently they were on guard for Tonya
Harding.</TE>
<TE>   I was searched at the door, officials telling me I could not bring an
unsanctioned teddy bear inside Staples and heave it at any of the guys
wearing sequins. They said if I paid 10 bucks for one inside Staples, I
could heave it at any of the guys wearing sequins--apparently the guards
at the door drawing the conclusion the only reason I was here was to see
the guys wearing sequins.</TE>
<TE>   I have to admit I was curious--intrigued after reading the morning
paper and learning Todd Eldredge "is a pair of loafers in a rack of
stiletto-heeled black leather boots." I wanted to see these guys who
could skate in stiletto-heeled black leather boots because you'd have to
be some kind of athlete to do that.</TE>
<TE>   I ran into Jill Greenleaf, events manager for the Figure Skating
Assn., and I was still a little ticked I couldn't bring in my own teddy
bear and asked her what the skaters do with all the stuffed animals
thrown at them.</TE>
<TE>   She said the skaters pick out the ones they like and donate the
remainder to a local hospital. I said that's nice that the skaters pass
on all the crummy stuffed animals they don't want to the local hospitals,
and I got one of those looks from Greenleaf that I get on occasion from
Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   I asked if there were any sequin vending machines in the building, and
I don't recall the conversation going much further than that with Jill.</TE>
<TE>   I was directed to Bob Dunlop, skating's P.R. guy, who said he couldn't
think of any skater capable of answering the types of questions I was
going to ask. This was before I asked Bob if there was an ironclad rule
that pairs skating must include a man and a woman, so it beats me how he
knew what type of questions I might ask.</TE>
<TE>   I asked him why they call it the "death spiral" when the guy holds the
woman's hand and twirls her as she lowers her head to the ice--when no
one ever dies from the move, and I don't recall the conversation going
much further than that with Bob.</TE>
<TE>   Down in the media room, where ordinarily you find normal reporters who
cover real sports like basketball, I found the skating scribes and
listened to them interview the top U.S. pairs team--Kyoko Ina and John
Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you tell us how you two have evolved as partners?" a skating
scribe from the Washington Post wanted to know, and Kyoko beaming, said,
"John and I had a personal evolvement [eight monthsago]."</TE>
<TE>   I got to thinking, what with the stiletto-heeled black leather boots
and personal evolvements going on here this might be more of an
interesting sport than I first thought until Kyoko said: "I'm not with
John when we leave the rink ... but once a week we get together for
lunch."</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to get back to that part about their "personal evolvement"
eight months ago and get some juicy details, but the figure skating
scribes spent the next 15 minutes quizzing the pair about their lunches.
Who pays? When did they start? What do you talk about? No wonder no one
reads the stories these people write.</TE>
<TE>   On the main concourse I ran into Kathy Drevs, another skating
official, and asked if she thought it was necessary for these guys to
wear see-through tights and sequins, and she pointed to a picture of
Peter Tchernyshev--some skater dressed in shocking pink and said,
"See-through tights on Peter aren't a problem with me."</TE>
<TE>   I don't recall the conversation going much further than that with
Kathy.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Deavers, a novice dance skater, waltzed by with his mom and
dad, his dad quick to point out he once dressed in a Ducks' costume to
skate, his mother chiming in the whole family had dressed as ducks for a
performance, and their son--like me--looking to make a quick exit from
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Daddy Duck said, "you think there's a feminine thing about the sport,
don't you?"--his son adding, "There's not, but some make it look feminine
like Rudy," and I was set to challenge him on that because I've spent
time at Notre Dame and I know Rudy, when novice skater Cole Davis offered
to explain what this sport is all about.</TE>
<TE>   He said he spins on a blade one-eighth inch wide, holding his 82-pound
partner with one hand over his head--all of it demanding great strength
and athletic ability. I was impressed and gaining new respect for these
competitors when he told me next week the Mighty Ducks have asked him to
perform dressed like a doughnut.</TE>

<LD>Hubert Mizell of the St. Petersburg Times has no doubts that
Orr--that's Steve Spurrier's middle name--will succeed as an NFL coach.</LD>
<LD>   "Never, never, never have I known a more competitive person. Pete Rose
compares. Michael Jordan is of a similar mind-set. Playing against Orr in
golf can be cutthroat. Challenge him at a poker table and ol' No. 11
tries to rake all your money.</LD>
<LD>   "In darts, you become the target. He plays games a lot like Audie
Murphy approached the war.</LD>
<TE>   "Has there ever been a more intriguing free agent afloat in the NFL?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Mizell: "Whether it's to be the Bucs, Panthers, Redskins,
Chargers, Falcons or some other NFL franchise with ownership hunger for
higher awards, I see Spurrier winning big. Challenging for Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "In all those NFL precincts, the buzz is huge, mostly in favor of an
S.O.S. (Steve Orr Spurrier) hiring."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL single-game playoff record for
touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Transformation: Glenn Rogers of the San Antonio Express-News writes
that Jason Williams, who was criticized for his erratic play with the
Sacramento Kings, is a more disciplined player in Memphis:</TE>
<TE>   "Williams, while still tattooed and bald, has changed. His teammates
no longer quake when he fastbreaks off a loose ball with time running out
in a tight game.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, now Williams will look for an open lane to the bucket, or
open teammates and feed the right guy with the proper, catchable pass."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deep pockets: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "George
Steinbrenner buys up every high-ticket free agent in baseball, and he's
got enough left over to kick in $400 million to build a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Why isn't this guy secretary of the treasury?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sticking point: Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley, on guard Anthony Carter's
medical quandary--whether to rest his back or have surgery: "It's his
body. You're not going to stick a knife in anybody's body unless he wants
to get stuck."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gangway! Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Possible play
of the year: The Runaway Traylor--340-pound defensive tackle Keith
Traylor's lumbering 67-yard return after intercepting a pass in the
Chicago Bears' 33-13 rout of Jacksonville."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1982, John Roche of the Denver Nuggets
set an NBA record with seven three-point field goals in one quarter
against the Seattle SuperSonics. The record has since been tied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ricky Watters, five, while playing for the San
Francisco 49ers against the New York Giants in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Steve Serby of the New York Post, getting a bit carried
away with the Jets' last-second victory over the Oakland Raiders on
Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   "These are the sweetest victories, the ones where all you have is each
other, and your life is on the line, and you reach down deep into a place
you didn't know you had in you, and summon up all this heart and courage
and nerve and shatter the ugly perceptions about you ... "</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Hope They Can Swallow Up Ishii</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Japanese team accepts offer from highest bidder, but
winner still will have to sign pitcher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Yakult Swallows today accepted a bid from a major league team,
believed to be the Dodgers, for negotiating rights to star pitcher
Kazuhisa Ishii.</LD>
<LD>   The Swallows, Ishii's Japanese club, announced that they had accepted
the high bid in an auction of major league teams. The Dodgers' bid of
$11.5 million was the highest known to baseball sources when bidding
closed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a dispatch from Tokyo today, the Associated Press said the winning
bid was between $11 million and $12 million, but the Swallows cannot
reveal the winningteam because they found out only the amount of the high
bid, not the identity of the bidder.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers did not know late Tuesday night whether they had won,
spokesman Derrick Hall said. The Japanese commissioner's office will
officially notify major league officials today that the Swallows have
accepted, and major league officials will then notify the winning bidder.</TE>
<TE>   At least six teams, including the Dodgers and Angels, placed bids. The
Dodgers were apprehensive about claiming victory because the Seattle
Mariners and Texas Rangers have not confirmed how much they might have
offered.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners outbid the Dodgers last year for the rights to outfielder
Ichiro Suzuki, $13 million to $12 million. After Suzuki won the American
League most-valuable-player award last season, the Dodgers were
determined not to be outbid for Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   Yakult keeps the bid money and allows the winning bidder to negotiate
a contract with Ishii. The 28-year-old left-hander, who says he wants to
play in Los Angeles, went 12-6 with a 3.39 earned-run average for Yakult
last season. Assuming the Dodgers win the bidding, Ishii would be
expected to sign a three-year contract worth at least $11 million.</TE>

<HD>Selig's '95 Loan Raises Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bud Selig and a company controlled by Minnesota Twin owner Carl
Pohlad arranged for a $3-million loan to the Milwaukee Brewers in 1995, a
deal being called a possible violation of baseball rules.</LD>
<LD>   Former commissioners Bowie Kuhn, Peter Ueberroth and Fay Vincent said
Tuesday the loan was unprecedented and might have broken the rules.
Former players' association head Marvin Miller said it was a clear
violation, although Selig's lawyer said there was nothing improper about
the loan.</LD>
<LD>   "It's such a treacherous thing," Vincent said. "It would raise in my
mind all sorts of concerns."</LD>
<TE>   Selig was president and chief executive of the Milwaukee Brewers at
the time, as well as baseball's acting commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Selig, elected commissioner in July 1998, is behind the plan to
eliminate two teams before next season, most likely the Twins and
Montreal Expos. Pohlad could receive more in a contraction buyout than he
would if he sold the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The loan, first reported Tuesday by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis
and the St. Paul Pioneer Press, was made by Tempus Investment Corp., one
of Pohlad's companies.</TE>
<TE>   Selig personally put up a minimum of $795,000 of money-market funds as
collateral and the Brewers guaranteed the full amount. The loan was made
in June or July 1995, according to Bob DuPuy, Selig's lawyer and
baseball's chief legal officer. DuPuy said the loan was at 10.5%
interest--1.5% above the prime rate at the time--and it was repaid within
90 days when the Brewers secured longtime financing from Nationsbank Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "This, in my view, was a loan made by a bank at arm's length in the
ordinary course of business," DuPuy said. "It would be different if Carl
was lending the money, but this was a regulated financial institution
lending money. No one was particularly troubled by it."</TE>
<TE>   Selig and Pohlad did not return telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you believe that major league baseball should be insulated
from antitrust laws--which I don't--this is the kind of questionable
behavior that could make you think twice," said Sen. Paul Wellstone, a
Minnesota Democrat who has been critical of Selig's contraction plan.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Rule 20 (c) states: "No club or owner, stockholder,
officer, director or employee [including manager or player] of a club
shall, directly or indirectly, loan money to or become surety or
guarantor for any club, officer, employee or umpire of its, his or her
league, unless all facts of the transaction shall first have been fully
disclosed to all other clubs in that league and also to the commissioner,
and the transaction has been approved by them."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of two teams, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday their clubs were never told of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really horrifying," Miller said. "This is a violation of
baseball rules by an owner who is also the commissioner."</TE>
<TE>   Rule 20 (c) is one of baseball's protections against one team having
unfair influence over another.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of another case where an owner lent money to another
without approval. I don't know of a case where an owner lent money with
approval," said Vincent, who was ousted in 1992 by a Selig-backed group
of owners.</TE>
<TE>   Ueberroth, as did Kuhn and Vincent, confirmed that such a loan was
unprecedented but otherwise declined comment. Kuhn took a lawyer's view,
wondering if Tempus was actually run by Pohlad, a billionaire banker.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this sufficiently close to the top of the chain to qualify as
Pohlad? That I don't know. These are not easy areas," said Kuhn,
commissioner from 1969 to 1984.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selig planned to address a negotiating committee of players today, a
day after the union and owners resumed collective bargaining talks.</TE>
<TE>   The sides met for about an hour on Tuesday, the first talks since
negotiations to settle the union's grievance on Selig's contraction plan
broke down last month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear he's the guy who has to be involved if anything is going
to get done," union head Donald Fehr said, adding he would go into
greater detail after today's session.</TE>

<HD>Gonzalez Returning to Heart of Texas Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Juan Gonzalez is returning to the Texas Rangers, agreeing Tuesday
night to a $24-million, two-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez, 32, who turned down two-year offers from the New York Mets
and Baltimore, rejoins the team he played for when he won two American
League most-valuable-player awards. He is the Rangers' career leader in
home runs and runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   He'll bat cleanup in a power-packed lineup that also features Alex
Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and the recently acquired Carl
Everett.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got four potential first-ballot Hall of Famers on this club, so
he doesn't have to come in here and carry the load, be the guy--but being
in the middle of the order, he'll be a key component to our offense,"
Ranger General Manager John Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   Hart was Cleveland's GM last season when he signed Gonzalez to a
$10-million, one-year deal. Now in Texas, Hart undid one of the boldest
moves of his predecessor, Doug Melvin, who sent Gonzalez to Detroit after
the 1999 season, a year before he could become a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez gets a $2-million signing bonus, $10 million this year and
$12 million in 2003. The Rangers will defer $4 million of his salary this
year and $6.5 million next season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine we can get a player of this magnitude for these
kind of dollars," Hart said. "But this is a player who wants to come back
here. My sense was he turned down more money to come back home. It's part
of Juan buying into what we're doing here. I take my hat off to him. It
was important for him to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez turned down a $25-million, two-year offer from the Mets, who
up until Tuesday night thought they had a chance to land him. New York's
offer included a $12-million signing bonus paid over the two years. None
of the salaries would have been deferred.</TE>

<HD>Mora's Stance Proves Costly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Mora stood by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio to the end with
the Indianapolis Colts.</LD>
<LD>   It ended up costing Mora his job Tuesday, with team President Bill
Polian firing Mora.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a number of reasons I got fired, but the main one is that I
was asked by Bill Polian to fire Vic Fangio and I wouldn't do it," Mora
said during a 45-minute news conference at Indianapolis. "He was not the
only one I was asked to fire."</LD>
<TE>   Mora, 66, would not say how many assistants he was asked to fire.
Polian said all the assistants, except Fangio, would be "retained" under
the final year of their contracts--for now.</TE>
<TE>   Mora said Fangio insisted he should not give up his job to save
Fangio's. Mora said Fangio already has been offered the defensive
coordinator's post with the expansion Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   "What it came down to, in my mind, was what was right and what was
wrong," Mora said.</TE>
<TE>   Polian believed Fangio's system did not work well with the Colts'
young defense, which included six first-time starters this season and
finished 29th in defense and 31st in points given up.</TE>
<TE>   Mora had a 32-32 regular-season record with the Colts, including 6-10
this season, when the Colts were expected to be Super Bowl contenders.</TE>
<TE>   He was 0-2 in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Shanahan is staying with the Denver Broncos, turning down a
possible move to succeed Steve Spurrier as Florida coach.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan said he spoke with Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley,
but they didn't discuss contract terms.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan said his main question was whether Bronco owner Pat Bowlen
wanted him to stay. Bowlen does and "that's all I needed to know,"
Shanahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowlen said Shanahan has four years left on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Viking owner Red McCombs told Mike Tice he's the leading
candidate to replace Dennis Green as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Tice was interim coach in Minnesota's 19-3 loss to Baltimore on Monday
night, after Green was forced out last week after 10 years as coach. The
Vikings finished 5-11 and out of the playoffs for the first time since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Strahan's record-breaking sack of Brett Favre will not be
reviewed by the Elias Sports Bureau, official statisticians for the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour Siwoff, president of the bureau, said the only way the sack
would be reviewed--or changed statistically--was if one of the teams
filed an appeal, which they won't.</TE>
<TE>   Strahan sacked Favre easily toward the end of the Green Bay Packers'
34-25 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday. Some questioned whether
Favre allowed the sack to happen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear fullback Daimon Shelton will sit out the playoffs after
losing his appeal of a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's
policy on anabolic steroids and related substances.... The San Francisco
49ers signed end Troy Wilson to bolster their depth on a defensive line
weakened by injury. The 49ers play Green Bay on Sunday, with ends John
Engelberger and Chike Okeafor unlikely to play. Engelberger, a starter
for most of the season, sprained an ankle in the 49ers' 38-0 victory over
New Orleans on Sunday, and Okeafor broke a leg last month against
Philadelphia.... The Texans signed guard Jim Jones, cornerback Anthony
Malbrough and running back Frank Moreau, increasing their roster to 13
players.... The Dallas Cowboys reassigned offensive coordinator Jack
Reilly to a senior assistant position. The Cowboys ranked 29th in offense
this season.... Cowboy Coach Dave Campo had hip-replacement surgery....
Kansas City Chief tight end Tony Gonzalez has a sprained knee and will
not need surgery, but will sit out next month's Pro Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Wizard Is Off to Hall of Fame</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The all-time best fielding shortstop, Smith becomes the
37th player elected in his first year of eligibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 13-time Gold Glove winner as the best fielding shortstop in
baseball history, Ozzie Smith came up bronze Tuesday when it was
announced he had been elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of
eligibility. He will be inducted at Cooperstown on July 28.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, named on 433 of the 472 ballots, or 91.7%, was the only former
player to receive the required 75% in voting by eligible members of the
Baseball Writers Assn. of America.</LD>
<LD>   Catcher Gary Carter, who continued to close in on the honor in his
fifth year on the ballot, received 343 votes, only 11 shy of election,
and had to cancel a party at his Florida home.</LD>
<TE>   "When the anticipation is so high, obviously there's a letdown," he
said. "It's like somebody dangling a carrot in front of a horse but
saying, 'No, you can't eat it."'</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who set major league records for assists, double plays and
chances during his 19-year career with the San Diego Padres and St. Louis
Cardinals, became the 37th player elected in his first year of
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   No one besides Carter came close. Jim Rice was third in the voting at
55.1%, followed by Bruce Sutter at 50.4%. Andre Dawson, thought to have a
strong chance of being elected in his first year on the ballot, received
only 214 votes, 140 fewer than needed. Luis Tiant failed in his 15th and
last year of eligibility, while Ron Guidry and Dave Stewart were among
several well-known players who failed to get 5% of the votes and will be
dropped from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Smith landslide, coming a year after Bill Mazeroski's selection by
the veteran's committee, was further recognition of defense.</TE>
<TE>   At 47, Smith--scheduled to run a leg of the Olympic torch relay in St.
Louis on Tuesday night--said he was too old to perform his patented back
flip in response to his selection, but he called it "very rewarding" in
that he had to work twice as hard in an offense-dominated game "to
achieve the same things as those big guys who hit the ball out of the
park."</TE>
<TE>   Although he collected 2,460 hits and felt he became more well-rounded
"than I was given credit for," Smith acknowledged that his election
"speaks to the impact I had at my position. I didn't like the moniker of
being a one-dimensional player, but I prided myself on having the ability
to change the momentum of a game simply by making a great defensive play.
I had the good fortune of going to Cooperstown last year for Mazeroski's
induction and it sent a clear message to me that I had a chance.
Hopefully, it helps open the door for more players who were primarily
defensive guys."</TE>
<TE>   If Smith revolutionized the shortstop position with his acrobatic
range and agility, the position has undergone another revolution with
bigger, stronger players who are posting power numbers that Smith called
"unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   He called it a "great period" in the history of the position but said
something has to give and that the bigger and stronger shortstops become,
the less range they are likely to cover and that "there will always be
room for the prototypical shortstop [like himself]." Of the great cast at
the position today, Smith singled out Derek Jeter for the defensive
stability and clutch hitting he provides the New York Yankees, and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Jeter has to have a distorted view of what baseball is all about the
way he makes it to the World Series almost every year."</TE>
<TE>   Smith played in three World Series, and now he is headed to
Cooperstown with nothing to be defensive about if his ticket was punched
with his glove.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he ever had time to marvel at his several highlight reels of
spectacular plays, the "Wizard of Oz" laughed and said: "In the midst of
making plays you don't have time to admire them. I tried to [forget] the
good plays just as quickly as the bad because the next one might be more
important. Since retiring, I've had the chance to sit down and look at
some of the plays on tape, and you know what? I was good."</TE>

<HD>Brand's Elbow Is Sore Spot</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Clipper power forward Elton Brand will ring the opening bell this
morning at the New York Stock Exchange. He, several teammates and members
of the coaching staff will also visit ground zero in lower Manhattan,
site of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But at some point today, Brand will probably have his sore right elbow
X-rayed. He was injured Dec. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Although he has not sat out because of the injury, his shot has
suffered.</LD>
<TE>   Brand had only nine points (on four-of-14 shooting) in Monday's loss
to the Philadelphia 76ers. After spending much of Tuesday receiving
treatment on his elbow, he had 17 points (making eight of 10 shots and
one of two free throws) in a loss to the Washington Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   "The shot felt good," Brand said. "I'm trying to stay away from an
X-ray. I know I'm going to have to sit out if they find something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about an apparent reluctance to shoot Tuesday, Brand said, "It
[the elbow pain] is still in my head somewhat."</TE>

<TE>   Lamar Odom felt sick after eating something that didn't agree with him
on the team's charter flight to Washington late Monday. He tried to play
against the Wizards, but went only 15 minutes and had four points, four
assists and three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "If you took Michael Jordan off his team, it would be the same if you
took Lamar off our team," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said.</TE>

<HD>Cuban Gets $500,000 Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban took another shot at NBA officials
Tuesday after the league hit him with a record $500,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>  "The fact of the matter is the NBA is more about power than it is about
getting the best possible product or even protecting its players," said
Cuban, a longtime critic of game officials. He was fined seven times last
season for a total of $505,000.</LD>
<LD>  The latest fine--the largest against an individual in NBA history--came
in response to Cuban's comments about the officiating after the
Mavericks' 105-103 loss to San Antonio on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>  "Relative to the size of the industry, it's a pittance," Cuban told
ESPN.</TE>
<TE>  As in the past, Cuban is matching the fine with a contribution to
charity.</TE>
<TE>  The largest team fine was the $3.5 million NBA Commissioner David Stern
imposed on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Oct. 25, 2000, for making a
secret deal with forward Joe Smith.</TE>
<TE>  Cuban said he became angered Saturday when he thought the Spurs' Tim
Duncan traveled on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>  "It happened multiple times right in front of me and they didn't do a
thing," said Cuban, who has been especially critical of league director
of officials Ed Rush.</TE>
<TE>  "Ed Rush might have been a great ref, but I wouldn't hire him to manage
a Dairy Queen," Cuban said in a story in The Dallas Morning News. "His
interest is not in the integrity of the game or improving the
officiating."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The Charlotte Hornets are expected to ask the NBA for permission to
move to New Orleans, the Charlotte Observer reported in today's editions.
The decision would again dash Anaheim's hopes of luring an NBA team to
the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>  Memphis point guard Jason Williams apologized for calling his team the
worst in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>  Williams was fined an undisclosed sum by the Grizzlies for his comment
after a fourth consecutive loss on Sunday, the team said.</TE>
<TE>  "I apologize for the way I reacted to our frustrating loss," Williams
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>  "I am a competitor. I said some things in the heat of the moment."</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bibby Critical of Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Henry Bibby has an inkling as to what to expect from UCLA on
Thursday night when his Trojans play the Bruins at the Forum in a matchup
of the Pacific 10 Conference's lone 4-0 teams.</LD>
<LD>  "UCLA normally sets the tone by coming out and using the old iron-fist
tactics, where they take one or two [hard] fouls at the beginning," Bibby
said Tuesday at his weekly media luncheon. "They come out and throw a
couple of elbows and throw a couple of guys down and get away with it
every year."</LD>
<LD>  Bibby was referring to two fouls in the teams' first meeting a year ago
at Pauley Pavilion, when UCLA point guard Earl Watson knocked Trojan
forward David Bluthenthal into the scorer's table and Bruin center Dan
Gadzuric leveled USC guard Desmon Farmer on a breakaway dunk attempt.</LD>
<TE>  "And nothing was done about that and they come out and do that every
year to start the game off and we're the ones to get penalized," Bibby
said. "Lou [Campanelli, the Pac-10's coordinator of men's basketball
officiating] is going to be here for the game and hopefully it doesn't
start off like that again."</TE>
<TE>  After setting the tone, UCLA took a nine-point lead before holding on
for an 80-75 victory.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Campanelli said Tuesday, that after reviewing tape of an "elbowing"
incident at Washington on Dec. 27, no action will be taken. USC had filed
a grievance, claiming two Trojans were hit by errant elbows.</TE>
<TE>  Campanelli said the tape shows USC forward Jerry Dupree setting an
illegal screen on Washington freshman forward Jeffrey Day. He added that
Dupree basically ran into Day's elbow and, as a result, Dupree's head
bounced back into Errick Craven's right eye.</TE>
<TE>  "It was basically self-defense on the part of the Washington player,"
Campanelli said. "The screener has to give the cutter time and distance
[when setting a screen]."</TE>

<LD>UCLA practice went nearly an hour longer than scheduled, and there
wasn't much standing around.</LD>
<LD>  Coaches took the scout team aside beforehand and urged the players to
push the regulars. They did, and eventually the regulars pushed back.</LD>
<LD>  "The guys on the bench caught us off-step," forward T.J. Cummings said.
"They are trying to prepare us for the game and they came out with this
incredible energy."</LD>
<TE>  USC, the Bruins' opponent Thursday, mixes up its defenses and plays
aggressively.</TE>
<TE>  "At this point, we aren't very good at reading defenses and getting
quality shots," guard Jason Kapono said. "So the scout team came out and
changed up defenses on us like the Trojans do."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  UCLA and USC are tied for first in the Pacific 10 Conference by virtue
of beating Washington and Washington State twice. But Cummings believes
USC pointedly beat iboth worse than the Bruins did.</TE>
<TE>  "Any dummy can figure out they killed the Washington schools to show us
they mean business," he said.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Guard Rico Hines suffered a mild concussion at practice when he was
knocked to the floor and hit his head chasing a loose ball. He is
expected to play Thursday.</TE>
<TE>  Hines, who has started the last nine games--all UCLA victories--also
got a cut over his left eye during the fall and will be evaluated by
trainers today.</TE>
<TE>  "He'll be back for 'SC," Kapono said. "There's no way he'd miss that
game."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moochie Norris is making a habit of sinking big shots at the end of
games.</LD>
<LD>   The reserve guard came through again Tuesday night at Houston, making
a three-point shot from the corner at the buzzer to lift the Rockets over
the Knicks, 88-86, New York's third consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   "The dude is amazing," teammate Cuttino Mobley said. "It seems like he
always hits those shots. After this one, I looked at him and just said
you are blessed man."</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth buzzer-beater of Norris' career.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems whenever it comes down to crunch time, Steve [Francis] or
Cuttino get the ball and I always walk up to them and say, 'If my man
leaves me, look for me in the corner,"' Norris said. "It feels great
being in those situations. It's something you dream about."</TE>
<TE>   Norris, who had 13 points, was called for an offensive foul with 13
seconds to play. That led to Allan Houston's basket, which gave the
Knicks an 86-85 lead with seven seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets worked the inbounds pass to Steve Francis, but he got
bottled up and passed to Norris, who was alone in the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Thomas led the Rockets with 24 points. Houston led the Knicks
with 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   New York has lost five of its last six games and dropped to 4-11 since
Don Chaney replaced Jeff Van Gundy as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Knick backup center Travis Knight, a former Laker, injured his right
knee during the first half and was scheduled for an MRI exam today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 101, Portland 92--Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 30 points at
Atlanta as the Hawks used a 12-4 run midway through the fourth quarter to
finally put the Trail Blazers away and end a two-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Bonzi Wells scored 26 for the Trail Blazers, who had won two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 104, Miami 95--Keith Van Horn scored eight of his 19 points
in the decisive fourth quarter at East Rutherford, N.J., leading seven
Nets in double figures in a victory over the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey, which ended Miami's season-high three-game winning streak,
won despite blowing a 17-point, first-half lead.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo Mourning had season bests of 26 points and 14 rebounds for the
Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 84, Toronto 81--Stromile Swift scored the final six points at
Memphis, Tenn., as the Grizzlies ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Swift and Pau Gasol each had 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter led the Raptors with 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 95, Denver 94--Dirk Nowitzki scored 27 points, and his
three-point play with 6.9 seconds left sent the Mavericks to victory at
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Avery Johnson's layup with 19.7 seconds remaining had given Denver a
94-92 lead. But Nowitzki answered with a turnaround jumper while being
fouled by Ryan Bowen.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas was without No. 2 scorer Michael Finley (strained left
hamstring), who went on the injured list Tuesday for the first time in
his six-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 98, Phoenix 84--Scott Padgett scored a career-high 17 points as
the host Jazz dealt the Suns their fourth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half, but it was
Utah's reserves that made the difference with 49 points in moving the
Jazz two games above .500 for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 113, Golden State 97--Sam Cassell had 23 points, 10 assists
and eight rebounds at Oakland to help the Bucks snap a four-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors, losers of six in a row, are 4-8 under interim Coach
Brian Winters, who replaced Dave Cowens last month.</TE>

<LD>Florida hired New Orleans Saint defensive coordinator Ron Zook to
replace Steve Spurrier, Saint Coach Jim Haslett said Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Gainesville Sun also reported the hiring, and said Zook, 47, will
be introduced as Florida's head coach at a news conference today.</LD>
<LD>   Foley met with Zook for about two hours Tuesday after Denver Bronco
Coach Mike Shanahan turned down the job. On Monday, Oklahoma Coach Bob

<HD>A Tough Bunch to Read</HD>

<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Judging by the reaction to his latest book giveaway, Phil Jackson
ought to save his money next year.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson hands out books on the first extended trip of each season, and
this year's Lakers received theirs on Saturday's flight to Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   By Tuesday night, most of the players could not name the title or
author of their book, and many had no intention of reading them anyway.
Ah, the price of education.</LD>
<TE>   A few remembered, or at last had the books handy in their duffel bags:</TE>
<TE>   To Mark Madsen, Jackson gave "Reservation Road," by John Burnham
Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   To Rick Fox, he gave "John Henry Days," by Colson Whitehead.</TE>
<TE>   To Slava Medvedenko, "The Tao of Sports," by Bob Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   To Shaquille O'Neal, "Steppenwolf," by Hermann Hesse.</TE>
<TE>   To Jelani McCoy, "Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections
On and Off the Court."</TE>
<TE>   To Mitch Richmond, "More Than a Game," by Charlie Rosen and Phil
Jackson. You can assume the coach got a cut on the last one.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he probably wouldn't read his but that Jackson should not
take that personally.</TE>
<TE>   "If it ain't a law-enforcement book or a Federal Bureau of
Investigation book, I'm not at liberty to read it right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, in the spirit of giveaways, O'Neal said he had something for
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "'Shaq Talks Back,"' he said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It would not be at all surprising if O'Neal sat out a game or two, or
even went to the injured list, in the days leading to the All-Star game,
which will be played Feb. 10 in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Tuesday if he assumed he would play in that game, he said, "I
don't assume anything."</TE>
<TE>   The league frowns on players who are healthy enough to play in the
games leading to All-Star weekend, and then refuse to participate, as
Bryant considered last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who has a tender right hamstring, played 12 minutes
against Detroit. Fox lost both stitches from his upper lip prematurely,
and played 22 minutes anyway.</TE>
<TE>TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   At Indianapolis</TE>
<TE>   4 PST (5:30, Ch. 9)</TE>
<TE>   Site--Conseco Fieldhouse</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 25-6, Pacers 20-15.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Pacers (2000-01)--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Pacers start Jermaine O'Neal and Jalen Rose at forwards,
Jeff Foster at center and Reggie Miller and Jamaal Tinsley at guards.
Tinsley, the first-round pick from Iowa State, is the favorite for rookie
of the year. He averages 9.9 points and 9.1 assists, and has made Travis
Best expendable. The Pacers have won six of eight games, including a
10-point win in San Antonio on Friday and a two-point win the next night
in Houston. O'Neal averages 19 points and 10.4 rebounds. Miller is
shooting 44.8% from the three-point line and averages 16.5 points.</TE>

<HD>At Least for Now, Cohen Will Stay Conservative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sasha Cohen and her coach, John Nicks, have raised disagreement to
a fine art.</LD>
<LD>   The strong-willed 17-year-old and her veteran coach seem to enjoy
their battle of wills, perhaps Cohen more than Nicks, because she usually
wins.</LD>
<LD>   But the Laguna Niguel resident will heed Nicks' advice that she pay
less attention to the record books and more attention to her prospects of
finishing in the top three at this week's U.S. Figure Skating
Championships, which would give her a berth on the U.S. Olympic team for
the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<TE>   With that in mind, Cohen said Tuesday she won't attempt a quadruple
salchow, a jump no female skater has landed in competition. Her success
ratio still isn't good enough to gamble on it here, with so much at
stake.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was mutual," Cohen said of the decision. "At this point of
the season, I'm just trying to do two clean run-throughs.... Hopefully,
if I make the Olympic team, we'd like to try it there."</TE>
<TE>   Nicks, who works with Cohen in Aliso Viejo, said he usually encourages
her to take risks that would push the limits of the sport. But in this
case, the reward doesn't justify the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two goals," he said. "She had hers and I had mine.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is for her to make the Olympic team. Her goal is to be the
first lady to land a quad in competition. They're both laudable, but they
conflicted at times.... If we're fortunate enough to make the Olympic
team and we get back to training next week, the quad will be No. 1 on our
minds."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen made a splash by finishing second at the 2000 national
competition, but she missed last year's event because she hadn't
recovered her fitness after a back injury. She competed in quite a few
events this season to remind the judges of her talents, perhaps the
reason she said she feels no need to dazzle them this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had some good skates and bad skates," she said. "I can do well,
and that's what I'm trying to do, go out and get a spot on the team, and
not necessarily prove myself."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan said she plans to limit herself to one triple-triple
combination jump in her long program Saturday, the triple toe loop-triple
toe loop she has done before. She had been working on other triple-triple
combinations to enhance the difficulty of her program but decided not to
risk it here.</TE>
<TE>   "The lutz-loop was giving me problems," she said, "so I thought it was
wise right now to do what's solid and what's consistent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 2,000 tickets remain for Saturday's women's final. However,
sales for the remaining sessions have not been strong.</TE>

<HD>This Event Is Definitely Missing Its Usual Staples</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Men In Black On Ice was the theme on a monochrome kind of night at
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Tuesday, but first, let's start
with what was missing at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Staples.</LD>
<LD>   The question came quickly to mind, right after where have all the
figure skating fans gone, where have all the giraffe costumes gone and
where, more specifically, have all of Michael Weiss' jumps gone?</LD>
<TE>   Where have all the flowers gone?</TE>
<TE>   It used to be an undeniable fundamental of the sport, its unique
branding device. After a skater completes his or her routine, tradition
holds that appreciative fans show their approval by pelting the ice with
floral bouquets. It's always done at proper figure skating competitions,
along with occasional tossing of stuffed toys. And, on rare occasions,
such as the 1998 Olympic trials in Philadelphia, where fans still were a
little unfamiliar with the basics, stuffed toys still unwrapped inside
their cardboard boxes were flung onto the ice, sending skaters running
for cover.</TE>
<TE>   In sports, you are what you throw. In hockey, fans in Detroit litter
the ice with slimy eight-legged sea creatures, Detroit being a big sushi
town. In football, fans in Cleveland litter the field with plastic beer
bottles, Cleveland being a big plastic beer bottle town. In baseball,
fans in New York take home-run balls hit by the opposition and heave them
back onto the field as part act of defiance, part
hey-welcome-to-the-neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   And in figure skating, they throw flowers.</TE>
<TE>   But not at Staples, not in security-tight 2002, with metal detectors
still framing the entrance doors and security guards shaking down writers
brazen enough to carry diet soda cans from the media lounge to the media
workroom.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation of the fortress conditions expected next month at Salt
Lake City, the Olympic figure skating trials in Los Angeles are a little
nervous, which is understandable, even though bouquets, at first glance,
would not seem a significant threat.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the staples that hold the cellophane wrapping around the
flower. Those staples have been deemed dangerous to the arena's ice
surface, which is chewed up by King defensemen on a regular basis but
must, according to the rules, be kept in pristine condition for the
figure skaters.</TE>
<TE>   So, these U.S. championships have been de-flowered.</TE>
<TE>   They also have been de-populated, judging by the early returns. For
the opening night of elite competition, the men's short program, the
arena was less than half-full. This could be attributed to an
inexplicably late 8 p.m. start--with no live TV, there was really no
reason to start so late and blow newspaper deadlines from the Rockies to
New England, except that another figure skating tradition holds that all
of these sort of events require an opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   So before Timothy Goebel, Weiss and Co. could skate before the empty
seats, the few fans rattling around the building were treated to a
half-hour retrospective on the 1972 Olympic trials, which featured old
footage of young men and women skating before the empty seats at Long
Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   (Interesting, though: The suite level appeared filled to capacity. SRO
in the private boxes. Not surprising, considering the sport's target
demographic. From sequins to baubles to the platinum credit cards in the
audience, it's quite the suite science.)</TE>
<TE>   Also missing, sadly, is the kind of sartorial insanity that used to
make men's skating worth the price of admission. The reigning men's
Olympic champion, Ilia Kulik, is remembered not so much for his acrobatic
virtuosity at Nagano as for his stirring impersonation of a jellyfish
during his short program, followed by the now-legendary giraffe-spotted
rain slick he donned for his long program.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, there was none of that. Instead, with few exceptions, it was
black on black on black.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Eldredge, five-time U.S. champion, glided out in all black, save
for a trio of crimson stripes across his left sleeve and down his right
torso. Weiss, the 1999 and 2000 U.S. titlist? All black, with a top
splattered in sequins.</TE>
<TE>   It set the tone for a drab, unadventurous evening--at least until
Weiss launched into his first element, a quadruple-toe/triple-toe
combination, which he failed to land. The quad wasn't necessary. As
strategies go, it was a triumph of flash over substance. But Weiss had
been hitting it in practice, so he brought it out in competition, doing
what he could to enliven the somber proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, he botched his second element as well, a triple axel. A
big 0 for 2, right out the gate, leaving Weiss fifth, behind Eldredge and
Goebel, tied for first, and third-place Matt Savoie, who dared to wear
burgundy, and fourth-place Johnny Weir.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge had a bit of trouble with a triple lutz, and later complained
about the quality of the ice. A little choppy here, a little patchy
there.</TE>
<TE>   And that was without the staples.</TE>

<LD>As Nicholas LaRoche finished his short program during the junior
men's championship Monday, he was angry, yet satisfied.</LD>
<LD>   He was upset that a negligible fall during his routine probably cost
him the top spot going into Tuesday's final. But LaRoche was glad, in a
sense, he was not No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "If I had been first I might have tried to slide through," LaRoche
said. "Being behind the leader I had to push myself a little harder."</LD>
<TE>   Armed with incentive, and a confidence level that soared when he
landed his opening triple lutz-triple toe loop combination, the Gardner,
Mass., native, who moved to California in June to train, waltzed off with
the title at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   For LaRoche, 18, who finished seventh in last year's junior
competition, the victory was the culmination of six intense months with
new coach Ken Congemi.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to have a problem with my focus," LaRoche said. "I would do
one element of the program and then lose it through the rest. We worked
on completing an element, whether I did it well or not, and moving on
with the program."</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Rogers of Baltimore, who led after the first round, hurt his
chances by falling twice during the four-minute program. While his marks
from the judges were still in the 5.1 to 5.2 range, he could not score
enough to hold off LaRoche.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd had a bad warmup," said Rogers, who finished second. "I wasn't
getting enough rotation in my jumps. I think I was a little tense."</TE>
<TE>   In the junior dance competition, Loren Galler-Rabinowitz and David
Mitchell of Boston maintained their lead after Tuesday's second round.</TE>

<HD>Is Ice Dancing a Shambles? You Be the Judge</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>If someone has given you a ticket for today's ice dancing
compulsory competition, buy that person an ice cream cone. Put Brussels
sprouts in the bottom of the cone. Laugh uproariously. They deserve it.</LD>
<LD>   If you have a ticket for today's ice dancing compulsory competition
and you paid for it, please write in and explain yourself. You have paid
to watch a few hours of couples doing the same steps to the same music.
Over and over and over. There is no way to understand why some couple
gets one score and another couple gets another score.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the world of ice dancing. Sport or cult? Sport or pro
wrestling? Legitimate questions those are, but without legitimate
answers. The hair colors of the dancers, male and female, change as often
as a teenager's nail polish. The results change much less frequently.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. championship ice dancing competition begins today with those
compulsories. The less said the better. It is tedious. It is numbingly
boring. There are actual judges who give actual scores and who would tell
you that they have an actual point on those pencils they use to mark down
scores. Go figure.</TE>
<TE>   The men's and women's singles discipline dropped compulsory figures
years ago. The hierarchy noticed no one bought tickets to the event, that
the fans didn't care and that certain judges used the arcane standards of
the figures to manipulate the judging. So what if a skater completed 10
triple jumps over two days of short and long programs? If a certain
coterie of judges preferred to give a medal to a certain country, voila,
that skater aced the compulsories!</TE>
<TE>   And that's still the situation in ice dancing. So insidiously
incestuous is the judging that Dick Pound, the Canadian who was the
former vice president of the International Olympic Committee, has
recently suggested that ice dancing is in danger of being dropped from
the Olympic sports program.</TE>
<TE>   It is likely that Pound noticed the time a judge was seen sleeping
during a world championship competition and that a Ukrainian judge was
actually suspended, briefly, for giving hand signals to fellow judges at
the Nagano Olympics four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has won one medal, a bronze in the 1976 Games, the first time
ice dancing was an Olympic sport. With the exception of the exquisitely
mesmerizing performance of Britain's Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean
in 1984, all the gold medals have gone to skaters from Russia or the
former Soviet Union. In each Olympics, they have won two of the three
medals.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it can be very frustrating," U.S. ice dancer Naomi Lang
says. "As a skater you can't count on the judges to do the right thing.
You learn not to pay attention to everything going on around you and
enjoy the skating ... even if the judges put you five places below where
you're supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the attitude an athlete should have. An athlete shouldn't
be resigned to being worked over by a judge.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Webster, a former U.S. ice dancer and a publicist for Lang and her
partner, Peter Tchernyshev, blows out a puff of air before she starts
talking about ice dance judging.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely embarrassing," Webster says. "I would not let my
children get into ice dancing the way it is now.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the Russian federation. All of the Russian skaters give back 30%
[of their earnings] to the Russian federation. The federation picks the
judges. There are major incentives for those judges to make things
happen. It is so corrupt and it is so sad for these poor athletes."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic ice dancing panel includes no representative from the U.S.
or Canada but five from former Soviet Bloc countries.</TE>
<TE>   At the Nagano Olympics, the Canadian team of Shae-Lynn Bourne and
Victor Kraatz spoke early and often about feeling they were poorly
judged.</TE>
<TE>   And they were. And they went home not with the gold medal they had
hoped for, but with no medal at all. And now no Canadian judge.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidence?</TE>
<TE>   "This has been allowed to go on too long," Webster says. "It's a good
old boys' club and part of that is the perverse judging which pervades
everything.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you justify having your child in this sport, putting your
whole life on hold, maybe postponing an education? You'd better be doing
it because you love it. Don't be ever hopeful things will change. It's
too ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Zhulin, a former Russian Olympic medalist, and 1993 world
champion, coaches Lang and Tchernyshev now. He begs us all not to give up
on ice dancing or wish it away from the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is saying this is not sport, there is something wrong with
that. The judging, yes, it has always been a little political.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, honestly, here is the problem. No one is allowed to speak
to U.S. judges. U.S judges, they are very unpredictable. If U.S. judge
would just be involved in the system, right away the American couple
would jump a couple of places right away."</TE>
<TE>   Whew, that's better.</TE>
<TE>   If only our judges would schmooze more, their judges would snooze
less.</TE>
<TE>   Then things would be OK.</TE>

<HD>Hartsells Try Again in Pairs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 2000 Danielle Hartsell shattered her kneecap. It took surgery
and lots of hardware to put the knee back together. In 2001 Steve
Hartsell cracked open his head. It took 12 stitches to put the head back
together.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's 2002 and the Hartsells, sister and brother, are together at
Staples Center, crossing their fingers, making sure the bad-luck clothes
are in another closet and aiming for an Olympic spot as one of two figure
skating pairs the U.S. will send to Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, two-time defending U.S. champions, are
the heavy favorites to win one of the U.S. spots as the competition
begins at 8:30 tonight with the short program.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999 the Hartsells seemed well on their way to becoming the top
American pair. In the first post-Olympic nationals, the young duo from
the Detroit Skating Club was the surprise winner. "We were like little
computers," said Steve Hartsell. "Whatever data was put in, we spit it
out on the ice. I don't think we really understood what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, they began to understand. In December 2000, in a routine
practice, on a routine throw, Danielle landed on the ice, right knee
first. The kneecap was fractured, almost in half. The rehabilitation took
the better part of a year. They did not defend their 1999 title.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in their last practice before the short program at the
nationals, the two tripped. Steve, trying to cushion Danielle's fall,
landed headfirst. After Steve got his stitches, the two skated in the
competition, but a poor long program doomed them to third place, one spot
too low to qualify for the World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   The Hartsells expect that Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, last
year's runners-up; Laura Handy and Jonathon Hunt, a relatively new and
rapidly improving pair; and Stephanie Kalesavich and Aaron Parchem,
junior champions in 2000 and fourth-place finishers at the senior level
last year, will be their toughest competition for the second Olympic
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The ice dancing competition begins the first of three rounds today at
5:10 p.m. with the compulsory dance.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu Schneider have only one point between
them, but the Kings are 3-0 since the usually high-scoring duo's return
to the lineup after long absences because of injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Both say they are still operating at less than full power.</LD>
<LD>   "I got a problem with the timing," said Palffy, who came away
empty-handed from Monday night's 3-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils,
although he had several good scoring opportunities. "That's the problem.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm getting there. It's a good thing for me that I have the chances.
I just have to keep going. Hopefully, it's going to come as soon as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said that he too is a little off, though fine physically.</TE>
<TE>   "It's coming together," he said. "I'm that close. Still, I'm missing
that first pass coming out of our end a couple times out of 10. But
everything else felt good. My legs felt good. I had a lot of jump.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just getting better each game. I'm very encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray expected them to struggle for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know that it's going to be a work in progress," he said.
"I mentioned when they came back that we couldn't expect immediate things
from them and that it would take some time, and it does."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though the Kings have lost more games than they've won, two of them in
overtime, they say they are one game over .500 at 17-16-7-2 because each
overtime loss is worth a point, same as a tie.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils, however, say they are an even .500 at 18-16-5-2. Only in
the NHL.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Oft-Injured Rucchin Working His Way Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching his teammates play is something center Steve Rucchin has
done a lot of lately and he's tired of it.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what to say. I really don't. It's more than
frustrating," said Rucchin, who has missed the last 27 games because of a
broken ankle, which required surgery Dec. 21. "The worst part is knowing
that you should be back and you're not, and you still have to go through
the whole conditioning process again."</LD>
<LD>   Rucchin has been the missing man for the Ducks for most of the last
two seasons. After averaging nearly 20 goals and 60 points over a
four-year span from 1996-2000, Rucchin missed 66 games because of various
head and hand injuries last season.</LD>
<TE>   Then 17 games into this season, Rucchin went down again against Dallas
on Nov. 11. The Ducks initially said Rucchin's injury would keep him out
of the lineup no more than six weeks, but that changed when his ankle
didn't heal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a joke," said Rucchin, who needed surgery to insert a screw
in his ankle four days before Christmas. "When I first got hurt, I
figured, at worst, I'll be out six weeks. But when I tried to come back
and skate, it was way too painful. I knew something had to be wrong. It
happens, not often, but sometimes fractures don't heal.</TE>
<TE>   "But it really doesn't surprise me after what happened to me last
year."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin hopes to be skating by the end of the month and wants to
return before the NHL Olympic break, which begins Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "That's being pretty generous," said Rucchin, who is still getting
around with crutches. "It's getting better as time goes on.... It's one
of those things, you have to basically wait in segments and see as it
feels."</TE>

recruiting visit to Notre Dame on Jan. 18.</LD>
<LD>  Booker, who rushed for a state-record 8,502 yards and 137 touchdowns,
said he solidified his decision last week when Notre Dame signed former
Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham to a six-year contract.</LD>
<LD>  "I like running behind big linemen and I know they're getting a bunch
of guys like that," Booker said. "Plus, I'm interested in Coach
Willingham."</LD>
<TE>  Booker rushed 12 times for 70 yards, including touchdown runs of two
and 15 yards, in the East-West all-star game last weekend. Four of the
starting offensive linemen in that game have committed to Notre Dame,
including Booker's high school teammate, James Bonelli.</TE>
<TE>  Booker has visited Florida State and Washington. He said he will visit
USC before the national letter of intent signing date of Feb. 6.</TE>

<LD>You can thank people such as Arizona Coach Lute Olson and former
NBA star Reggie Theus for providing the real entertainment at the boys'
basketball game Tuesday night between Westchester High and Fairfax.</LD>
<LD>  That's because people-watching became the activity of choice once
Westchester opened a 22-point second quarter lead en route to its 100-68
Western League thrashing of host Fairfax.</LD>
<LD>  The Comets (12-1), No. 1 in The Times' rankings, defeated the No. 4
Lions (15-3) for the second time this season, this time in a much more
emphatic manner than their two-point win last month.</LD>
<TE>  "We gave them a lot of confidence last time, so we had something to
prove--that we're the best team in the City Section," said Comet guard
Brandon Heath, who scored 19 of his game-high 24 points in the second
half as Westchester opened leads as large as 38 points.</TE>
<TE>  The game was played in sauna-like conditions in Fairfax's tiny gym,
which was filled beyond capacity as fans clogged the walkways and stood
along the baselines. The Lions played as if they were being suffocated on
offense in the first half, as they hurried shots and turned the ball over
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>  Fairfax's Evan Burns, who has committed to UCLA but undoubtedly was
drawing looks from five NBA scouts who attended the game, scored only two
of his team-high 21 points when the game was close.</TE>

<HD>MLS Eliminates Florida Teams</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Tampa Bay, Miami are contraction victims. Anschutz now
controls half the league.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With relative ease, a major sports league was able to contract
Tuesday, limiting the pain, suffering and litigation.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike major league baseball, there were no courtroom battles or
congressional hearings for the controlling powers of Major League Soccer
while it considered contraction.</LD>
<LD>   MLS started Tuesday with 12 teams and finished with 10, eliminating
the Miami Fusion and the Tampa Bay Mutiny.</LD>
<TE>   The reduction essentially leaves half of MLS in the hands of one man,
Colorado-based billionaire Phil Anschutz, operator of the Galaxy,
Chicago, Colorado, Washington D.C. United, and New York-New Jersey. The
MLS also announced Tuesday that Anschutz Entertainment Group exercised
its option to become the investor-operator of D.C. United.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the league will move to a two-conference format with the
Galaxy in the Western Conference, joining Dallas, Colorado, Kansas City
and San Jose. An allocation and dispersal draft will be held Friday. The
dispersal draft--in which the Galaxy has the ninth pick--follows the
allocation draft.</TE>
<TE>   Among the top players available include Fusion forward/midfielder Alex
Pineda Chacon, Mutiny forward Mamadou Diallo, Fusion goalkeeper Nick
Rimando and Fusion forward Diego Serna.</TE>
<TE>   MLS contraction was not unexpected and the vote to reduce was
unanimous, league officials said. Tampa had been without an owner since
it was founded in 1996, and the Fusion's Ken Horowitz said he and his
investors felt there were "too many hurdles" to overcome in the South
Florida market.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Commissioner Don Garber, who said the move will help the league
cut losses by 30% this season, also realized there would be some viewing
contraction as the beginning of the end.</TE>
<TE>   'I want to say that this could not be farther from the truth," he said
in a conference call. " ... There are always and there will always be
naysayers. There are always those who continually look at this league
with criticism. That is something that we in the soccer business deal
with every day, not only in professional soccer. I want to reiterate that
we have a five-year funding commitment. We have a five-year deal with ABC
and ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   Although already obvious, Tuesday's developments made it more
pronounced than ever that the league's future rests with Anschutz, said
David Carter, president of the Sports Business Group, a consulting firm
that specializes in strategic marketing for the sports industry.</TE>
<TE>   "What's amazing about it is the swiftness they pulled it off," he said
of contraction. "The league had been hemorrhaging money. It puts added
influence on Phil Anschutz's role in the entire league. Phil Anschutz
clearly was the most important individual and now he is, by far and away,
the most influential. As he wants the league to go, it will go. He has
more power and influence than the commissioner at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Garber addressed the Anschutz issue of control. In MLS, investors
purchase the right to operate teams, which are owned by the league.
Player contracts are owned by the league under the single-entity concept,
and teams share revenue with MLS.</TE>
<TE>   "Our single entity ensures competitive balance," Garber said. "We have
always had multiple team ownership and have never had any issues with
that. We have a wide variety of checks and balances in place and we will
continue to enforce them. Phil Anschutz and his group are investors in
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "They have made a massive commitment to the sport. This sport has
never had that one person or entity who has single-handedly said to the
naysayers: 'I'm right and you're wrong."'</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three days after introducing a promising 3-year-old filly named
Spring Meadow, trainer Bob Hess Jr. will send out another 3-year-old
filly in today's $75,000-added Blue Norther Stakes at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Spring Meadow, a daughter of Meadowlake out of the Mr. Prospector mare
Go For It Lady, dominated maidens in her career debut, winning by four
lengths in a rapid 1:084/5 for the six furlongs. She looks to have an
extremely bright future with Fog City Stable and it will be interesting
to see where she shows up next.</LD>
<LD>   While Spring Meadow still has to prove herself in stakes company,
Forty On Line already has for Hess. Five weeks after earning her first
win in her first race in this country, the English-bred filly scored a
front-running, 20-1 upset in the Miesque, a Grade III, at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership, the chestnut, who had finished fourth of seven
in her lone race in England last summer, has demonstrated versatility in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In beating her stablemate Westmead Empress by a head on Oct. 17, Forty
On Line rallied from a couple of lengths off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the Miesque, she took advantage of a paceless field to lead
every step of the way, eventually winning by a length over New York
shipper Riskaverse.</TE>
<TE>   Proven over the Santa Anita and Hollywood Park turf courses, the
daughter of Pharly will be opposed today by three of the fillies--La
Martina, Red Little Lies and Farda Amiga--who chased her in the Miesque
as well as Nunatall, who will be making her first start in this country
for trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of Night Shift owned by Ed Gann, Nunatall won one of three
overseas, earning her victory by four lengths in her final start in
France on Aug. 24. Kent Desormeaux will ride the English-bred, who will
be a first-time Lasix user today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The second is a 10-furlong turf race that brings
together Little Ghazi, who got the money in his California bow for
trainer Vladimir Cerin, and Nazirali, an Irish-bred who rallied from last
to win his first start in this country for trainer Julio Canani.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Donald Mills. At last glance, the trainer had won with 33
of 96 starters at Turf Paradise. His lone entrant at the Arizona track
today is Vigors Regard, who will face seven other $5,000 claimers in the
seventh race.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Forceful Guy. The gelding has not been much of a force in
the last couple of years. Since the beginning of 2000, he is 0 for 24. He
will run in today's ninth at Turf Paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three using Nazirali, Little Ghazi and
Scoring Slew in the second, singling Captain Squire in the third and
using H. Moore, Richillini and Boyohboyohboy in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/27. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $9/$178. Total money bet: $174.</TE>

<HD>'My Dad Hit Him 3 Quick Times'</HD>
<DH>Courts: A boy, 12, tells of a fatal fight involving his father at a
youth hockey practice in Massachusetts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>His hair freshly trimmed, his shirt crisply pressed and his wrist
in a red, white and blue cast from a recent hockey injury, the witness
nodded that yes, he knew the difference between right and wrong. Yes, he
said, he understood about telling the truth: If you don't, "you get
punished."</LD>
<LD>   With that introduction, 12-year-old Quinlan Junta mesmerized a crowded
courtroom here Tuesday as he took the stand as a defense witness in the
trial of his father, charged with beating another sports dad to death at
a youth hockey practice. Thomas Junta, 44, never took his eyes off his
only son as the boy recalled the fight at a nearby ice arena on July 5,
2000, that claimed the life of 40-year-old Michael Costin.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw my dad, and then I saw Mr. Costin on his back," the
sixth-grader testified. "I saw him flip [Costin] over his shoulders. He
went on the floor. I just like stood there. My dad hit him three quick
times, really quick."</LD>
<TE>   On cross-examination, prosecutor Sheila Calkins asked Quinlan: "You
yelled out to your dad, 'Stop!' didn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," the boy answered.</TE>
<TE>   Costin never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Junta, charged with manslaughter, contends he is not guilty
because he acted in self-defense during the fracas at the end of a
children's practice. The trial is expected to go to the jury by week's
end. If convicted, Junta could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The sons of both men were on informal but opposing teams. The fatal
altercation started when the two fathers exchanged harsh words on the
ice. Costin, in skates, was supervising the practice and Junta, in shorts
and a muscle T-shirt, was complaining that the play was too rough.</TE>
<TE>   The argument boiled over into a locker room, where the men fought
before being separated. The last, lethal round took place in an open area
in front of the skating rink, where Costin was left unconscious on the
rubber mat that covered the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The case has drawn widespread attention as an example of the danger of
parental over-involvement in youth sports. Both Junta and Costin were
avid hockey dads whose sons regularly skated at the Burbank Ice Arena in
Reading, 15 miles north of Boston. When the informal stick practice
degenerated into a brawl on the ice 17 months ago, Costin's three sons
were on one side of the action--and Quinlan Junta was on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was just going to be playing a friendly game," Quinlan
said. When his team started to win the pickup game, he said, "they
started hitting us."</TE>
<TE>   The boy, whose hockey career already has encompassed more than half
his life, took the stand amid controversy both over the use of child
witnesses and over the use of their full names. Against the judge's
advice, a 12-year-old figure skater who testified Monday was identified
both by prosecutors and by some news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not summon Brendan, 14, Michael, 13, or 12-year-old
Sean Costin as witnesses--although the victim's three sons were present
the day their father died. Any of the boys could be called as rebuttal
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>Defendant Gives Son a Pep Talk During Break</TE>
<TE>   The witness list for the trial includes 11 children, three of whom
have testified so far.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking some privacy in a quiet corner of a hallway outside the
courtroom Tuesday, Thomas Junta seized the occasion of a brief recess to
give Quinlan a fatherly pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the truth," he said, shaking the boy's hand. "Don't let them
scare you."</TE>
<TE>   It was a variation of the admonition Quinlan said his father gave him
after the friendly sports practice deteriorated into a pile of 10- to
12-year-old boys slashing each other with hockey sticks.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to defend myself," Quinlan said.</TE>
<TE>   Junta, a 6-foot-2, 275-pound truck driver when the incident took
place, himself rushed from the stands to the ice to defend his son's team
when the practice turned rough. His 12-year-old joined a chorus of
witnesses who recounted how Junta, enraged, called out to Costin--who was
skating with the boys--to break up the rumble. A self-employed carpenter,
Costin was 6 feet tall and weighed 156 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Quinlan said Costin replied, "Hockey's about hitting." Thomas Junta
fired back with an expletive and said, "It's about having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Repeated testimony since the trial began Thursday indicated that the
two men first scuffled in a locker room when the practice ended. Ryan
Carr, a 21-year-old hockey player from St. Michael's College in Vermont,
pulled the combatants apart. In front of the jury Monday, Carr used his
fists to demonstrate how Junta and Costa were fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Carr testified that it was Costin who threw the first punch in the
locker room. Carr also said Junta abruptly stopped hitting Costin and
simply walked away.</TE>
<TE>Rink Manager Testifies About Calling Police</TE>
<TE>   A rink manager, Nancy Blanchard, on Monday told the court she
immediately called the police emergency line. One concern she had,
Blanchard said, was that "there were kids everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Junta left the locker room but returned minutes later. In a police
tape recording made the day of the incident, he said he came back to tell
Quinlan to hurry and get his skates off.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been a totally slow dresser, my son," Junta was heard
saying in the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Junta and Costin were face to face, this time outside the
locker room. They exchanged heated imprecations and again began to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Blanchard recalled that the violence "seemed like three years, it
seemed like three minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Brings, who was waiting to drive her grandson home after the
stick practice, said she saw Junta atop Costin, repeatedly hitting him in
the head with his fists.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept screaming, 'Stop! Stop! Please stop! Think of your children,
you're going to kill him,' " Brings testified Tuesday. "I remember saying
to Mr. Junta, 'He's not responding, he's not responding. Don't hit him
anymore.' "</TE>
<TE>   The question of how many times Costin was hit remained central but
also unresolved. Quinlan Junta echoed his father's statement to police
after the melee that Costin was hit just three times. Other witnesses
were less certain. Brings said she saw "at least 10" punches thrown.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by defense attorney Thomas Orlandi Jr. whether her memory was
clouded by time or the emotion of the moment, Brings said firmly: "It's
something that I will never forget. It went on and on. He wouldn't stop,
and I was thinking, he's either going to kill this man or he is going to
have brain damage."</TE>
<TE>   After the fight, "I wanted to see my dad," Quinlan told the court
Tuesday. The boy said he was crying. The two friends who had come with
him also were crying, Quinlan said.</TE>
<TE>   He was upset, Quinlan said, "because I never saw anything like that
before."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the older Junta waited outside the ice arena with his
shirt torn and scratches on his face. Police officers testified that he
was polite and cooperative as he explained that he had been a participant
in a fight inside the arena.</TE>
<TE>   In the police tape played Monday, Junta said it was too bad that
Costin had allowed such rough play in a children's hockey game. The two
had never met before that day, Junta told police.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by police if there was anything else he wanted to say, Junta
said, "I wish it had never happened. And I hope the guy's fine."</TE>

<HD>Rap Music Chief Won't Face Charges in Federal Probe</HD>
<DH>Law: Racketeering investigation of 'Suge' Knight ends, sources say.
Label faces tax violation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal racketeering probe into allegations that Marion "Suge"
Knight and his Los Angeles label, Death Row Records, committed acts of
murder, drug trafficking, money laundering and gunrunning has resulted in
a pair of misdemeanor tax charges.</LD>
<LD>   Under a proposed plea bargain arrangement filed Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, Death Row would plead guilty to failing to
submit an income tax return; the label would pay a $100,000 fine and
reimburse the government an unspecified amount of unpaid taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Knight and his attorney said Tuesday's action signals the end of an
investigation launched in 1995 by the Los Angeles Police Department, FBI
and three other federal law enforcement agencies. No charges have been
filed against Knight, the original kingpin of gangsta rap music.</LD>
<TE>   "The truth is the truth," Knight said in an interview. "I appreciate
the fact that, after looking into these lies and finding nothing, they
had the integrity to say, 'OK, this guy broke no law,' and called it
off."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have declined to discuss or even confirm the
investigation since it began six years ago. On Tuesday, a spokesman for
the U.S. attorney's office refused to comment on whether Knight or Death
Row were ever the target of a criminal probe.</TE>
<TE>   But two law enforcement sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said the entire investigation is over. The sources added that
the probe into the more serious allegations has been inactive for nearly
two years and is unlikely to be revived unless Knight gets into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles issued a one-page
letter to Knight's lawyer stating that no charges would be pressed
against Knight for tax violations or money laundering, according to
sources familiar with the document. The letter did not exonerate Knight
on the allegations of murder, racketeering and other violent offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Knight became famous during the early 1990s for running a small,
cutting-edge record label that introduced the world to West Coast rap,
launching the solo careers of such international stars as Dr. Dre, Snoop
Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Death Row became the first hard-core rap label to
consistently dominate the pop charts, selling more than 30 million albums
and setting the stage for the global rap phenomenon. Gangsta rap music is
typically laced with obscene language depicting criminal behavior, drug
dealing, prostitution and the harsh realities of urban life.</TE>
<TE>Knight's Father Enters Guilty Plea</TE>
<TE>   The apparent shuttering of the racketeering probe ends an ugly chapter
in the music business. The LAPD suspected Knight of masterminding the
1997 slaying of rapper Notorious B.I.G. with the help of corrupt LAPD
officers, according to reports by numerous media outlets, including the
Los Angeles Times. Those reports were based primarily on information
provided by law enforcement sources and Death Row informants who also
cooperated with authorities who oversaw the federal probe.</TE>
<TE>   Court filings show that the government investigation turned up
evidence that Death Row failed to pay taxes on $825,716 in income
generated between Dec. 1, 1995, and Nov. 30, 1996. Knight blamed a former
accountant, whose firm paid an $8-million, out-of-court settlement to
Death Row after a lengthy legal battle.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's father, Marion Knight Sr., entered a guilty plea Tuesday for
the tax offense, according to the court filing. The violation could carry
a five-year probation sentence against Knight Sr., who is an officer of
the Death Row corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The plea bargain proposal was crafted by the U.S. attorney's office
and Knight's attorney, David Z. Chesnoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Knight and I appreciate the professionalism of the government in
handling this investigation and are pleased that it has come to this
conclusion," Chesnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight added: "I'm not mad at the government. The government has a job
to do, and I've come to respect the government when it does its work."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate but related deal filed Tuesday, Knight's former attorney
David Kenner agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax violation.
Kenner will pay about $20,000 in tax penalties and could receive as much
as one year in jail when the agreement is reviewed by a U.S. district
judge this month.</TE>
<TE>   Kenner declined to comment. His attorney, Don Re, said Kenner will pay
the fine but intends to file a request for probation.</TE>
<TE>   "David has so many health problems, including a serious heart
condition that has repeatedly put him in and out of the hospital," Re
said. "That's one of the main reasons we didn't fight this."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department launched its racketeering probe to determine
whether Knight's thriving rap label was a criminal enterprise with street
gang affiliations and Mafia ties.</TE>
<TE>   The government began keeping tabs on Knight in the early 1990s,
shortly after he and Compton rap producer Dr. Dre launched the first
black-owned-and-operated gangsta rap label. Defying music industry
convention, Knight strategically marketed music with violent lyrics and
hired unemployed ex-convicts as well as members of the Crips and Mob Piru
Bloods gangs to help build his gangsta rap empire.</TE>
<TE>   The burly, 6-foot-3-inch entrepreneur sports a diamond studded ring
that spells out the word "MOB." He named his short-lived Las Vegas
nightclub "662"--the numbers corresponding on a telephone keypad to the
word "mob." Although authorities began targeting a handful of Death Row
employees for their alleged participation in assaults and other criminal
activities, no arrests have been made.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the probe, prosecutors tried to establish whether Knight's
label was underwritten with drug money from convicted Compton crack
dealers Michael "Harry-O" Harris and Patrick Johnson. No money laundering
charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, sales of Death Row CDs had skyrocketed with the music
transcending color lines, turning rebellious black outcasts such as Snoop
Dogg, Dre and Shakur into suburban pop idols. The musicians became as
famous for their violent lyrics as their run-ins with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Knight had eight criminal cases on his rap sheet before he wound up in
prison. He was incarcerated in October 1996 when a judge determined that
he had violated his probation on a previous assault conviction by kicking
a man during a scuffle at a Las Vegas hotel. The scuffle took place hours
before Shakur was killed in September 1996 during a drive-by shooting.
Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was shot.</TE>
<TE>   After Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down in March 1997, agents from the
FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the LAPD began investigating Knight's possible role in
the slayings and other violent acts. Law enforcement authorities
investigated whether Knight staged Shakur's slaying and hired a hit man
to kill Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, police raided Knight's office and San Fernando Valley
home and confiscated a Chevrolet Impala that authorities believed was
used in the Wallace killing. Police returned the vehicle and other
personal and business items without pressing charges.</TE>
<TE>Knight Calls Media Reports 'Racist'</TE>
<TE>   The killings of Shakur and Wallace remain unsolved. Recently, Rolling
Stone and cable music TV network VH1 produced reports that suggested
Knight was linked to the slayings. Those reports were based on
information provided by former LAPD Det. Russell Poole, who worked on the
murder investigations of Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. and recently filed a
lawsuit against the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Poole has criticized the LAPD, saying it did not vigorously
investigate Wallace's death because the slaying may have involved corrupt
police officers linked to Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that Suge Knight was involved in the murders of Biggie and
Tupac," Poole said. "In my opinion, neither Knight nor Chief Parks have
been held accountable for what they've done."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, LAPD Chief Bernard Parks dismissed Poole's
theories as "wild and inaccurate fabrications."</TE>
<TE>   Knight insisted that he had nothing to do with the shootings and that
Poole's theories are false.</TE>
<TE>   "Underneath it all, what you're going to find here is this is just
about some former cop wanting to grab a bunch of money and a few moments
of fame," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who was released from prison in September after serving five
years, said he believes the media reports were racially motivated.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think they could get away with publishing this kind of crap
about a white Hollywood executive? No way. It's racist," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Rolling Stone and VH1 said they stand by their
reports.</TE>

<HD>High Court Limits Who Is Disabled</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Justices put federal anti-bias law further out of reach for
injured workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court made it harder Tuesday for millions of workers
with painful wrist injuries, bad backs or similar impairments to qualify
for protection as disabled people under the federal anti-discrimination
law.</LD>
<LD>   As long as they can brush their teeth and wash their faces in the
morning, these employees are probably not disabled, the high court said
unanimously, even if they suffer pain when typing on a computer or
lifting a box at work.</LD>
<LD>   A disabled person is someone who struggles to do basic tasks that are
"central to daily life," not the special tasks that go with a particular
job, said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, she said, a disabled employee must have an impairment that
is "permanent or long term," not an injury that is likely to heal.
Injured workers should seek benefits under state workers' compensation
laws, the court said, rather than claiming to be disabled under the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Business lawyers hailed the outcome and predicted it will shield
employers from being sued or forced to make special arrangements for the
growing number of employees with carpal tunnel syndrome or other
repetitive stress injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's ruling makes it clear that the ADA is still the Americans
With Disabilities Act, not the Americans With Injuries Act," said Patrick
Cleary, senior vice president for the National Assn. of Manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling may have little effect in California, however, where a
worker-friendly state law mandates that employers must accommodate people
with work-related injuries, employment lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's 9-0 ruling is only the latest court decision to limit the
reach of the landmark federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the justices ruled that people with correctable
conditions such as bad eyesight, or treatable diseases such as high blood
pressure, diabetes or epilepsy, are not protected from job bias. The
court reasoned that these people are not truly disabled because they were
able to work.</TE>
<TE>   The case decided Tuesday concerned an assembly line worker who could
no longer do her job because its repetitive motions caused intense pain
in her wrists and shoulders. Her condition, carpal tunnel syndrome, is a
common workplace injury.</TE>
<TE>   The case also drew wide interest because it asked a basic question:
Who is a disabled person?</TE>
<TE>   Ella Williams had worked with power tools at the Toyota Motors plant
in Georgetown, Ky. When her pain became crippling, she sought medical
treatment and obtained some benefits from Kentucky's workers'
compensation system. Typically, a workers' compensation law covers
medical expenses and some payment for lost work due to a work-related
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Williams chose to return to full-time work but asked to be assigned to
lighter duties, such as inspecting cars. Her doctor said she should lift
no more than 20 pounds. When her supervisors refused to accommodate her
request, she quit and sued the company under the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati sided with Williams and said
her injury was akin to having "damaged or deformed limbs." Because she
was unable to perform "a class of manual tasks at work," Williams had a
disability and her employer should have made a "reasonable accommodation"
for her, the appeals court said.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing, O'Connor faulted the lower court for focusing its
attention on the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   To be disabled, a person "must have an impairment that prevents or
severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of
central importance to most people's daily lives," she said. This includes
"such basic abilities as walking, seeing and hearing."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, "household chores, bathing and brushing one's teeth are
among the types of manual tasks of central importance to people's daily
life," she continued. Despite the fact that Williams could not handle
power tools, "she could still brush her teeth, wash her face, bathe, tend
her flower garden, fix breakfast, do laundry and pick up around the
house," she wrote in her opinion for the court.</TE>
<TE>   Because Williams was capable of performing these daily tasks, she was
not a truly disabled person, O'Connor concluded in Toyota vs. Williams,
00-1089.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department has estimated that more than 1 million U.S.
employees suffer repetitive stress injuries. They range from computer
users to baggage handlers and assembly line workers. Legal experts say an
even greater number of workers have back ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Another category of workers who are likely to be affected by Tuesday's
ruling are those who claim on-the-job stress.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers have been very skeptical of claims of a disability that
manifests itself when someone comes to work and miraculously disappears
when they punch out and go home," said Christopher Collins, a management
lawyer in New York. "I think the Supreme Court has recognized and said
you can't just look at work to decide if someone is disabled."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor's opinion does not close the door to all employees who suffer
carpal tunnel syndrome. If an employee's wrist pain is crippling and
permanent and prevents them from performing basic life tasks, he or she
could qualify as disabled. However, a person who is so crippled by pain
may not meet the test of being a qualified worker.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the Catch-22 they have created," said Arlene Mayerson, an
attorney for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund in
Berkeley. "This court seems determined to set a very strict test for
deciding who is disabled. You are either not disabled enough to qualify
or you are too disabled to do the job. That is not what Congress
intended."</TE>
<TE>   When signed into law by President George Bush, the ADA promised a new
era of civil rights protections for an estimated 43 million Americans who
lived with a mental or physical disability.</TE>
<TE>   It did not offer money benefits to disabled people. Instead, it was
intended to shield them from unfair discrimination in jobs, housing and
access to public facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress did not say exactly who was to be covered by the law. It
said only that a "qualified individual with a disability" is someone with
a "mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of
the major life activities."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, no one has disputed that people who are blind,
deaf or in a wheelchair have a disability. But the Supreme Court has been
skeptical of extending its protections much further.</TE>
<TE>   Even the court's liberal-leaning justices have signaled that they too
are worried about stretching the disability rights law too broadly. Its
"terms need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for
qualifying as disabled," O'Connor wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, she wrote an opinion for the court that disqualified
a veteran truck mechanic who had been fired from his job because of his
dangerously high blood pressure. The mechanic was not disabled, she said,
because he was quite capable of fixing trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, the court tossed out a disability claim brought by a
truck driver who could see with only one eye. Because he had an excellent
driving record, the trucker was not a person with a disability, the court
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, the court took a surprisingly liberal view of the
same law when confronted with the case of disabled golf pro Casey Martin.
That was not an employment dispute because golf pros are independent
contractors, not employees. Instead, the case came under the section of
the law that concerns access to public facilities, and the justices ruled
that the pro tour was required to allow Martin to ride in a golf cart.</TE>
<TE>   Two other ADA cases are pending this term. In a case heard in
December, the justices will decide whether employers must give a
preference to a disabled worker who wants to transfer to another job (US
Airways vs. Barnett, 00-1250).</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the court will consider whether an employer can refuse to
hire a worker with a disability whose health could be damaged by
conditions at the work site. An El Segundo oil refinery had turned away a
prospective worker with a severe liver impairment (Chevron USA vs.
Echazabal, 00-1406).</TE>

<HD>Key Al Qaeda Strategist Gains Priority in Terrorism Dragnet</HD>
<DH>Hunt: Abu Zubeida's job is to keep the network alive, officials
say. He may have left Afghanistan to activate new plots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the hunt for Al Qaeda leaders expands beyond Afghanistan,
authorities confirmed Tuesday that they are pursuing one man as intensely
as Osama bin Laden himself--an elusive Palestinian who they believe has
been entrusted with keeping the terrorist organization's global network
of cells alive and operational.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are also aggressively pursuing the theory that Abu
Zubeida, whose real name is Zain Al-Abidin Mohammed Husain, is the
"operational link" connecting Bin Laden and others who conceived the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with the hijackers who carried them out.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Zubeida, thought to be about 30, could well be at Bin Laden's side
as he tries to elude a global dragnet. But unlike Bin Laden and his aide
Ayman Zawahiri, whose movements are limited by their high profiles, Abu
Zubeida may have slipped out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan or almost
anywhere else to activate new plots and try to regroup Al Qaeda forces,
authorities fear.</LD>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida's role makes him a higher priority than even Zawahiri, who
authorities say is more of a theoretician. Since the reported death in
November of Mohammed Atef, Abu Zubeida is believed to have taken on the
added role of Al Qaeda's chief military strategist, according to U.S.
officials and counterterrorism experts.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida has well-established personal ties to many of the Al Qaeda
cell leaders and soldiers in far-flung posts, whom he cultivated as the
group's longtime liaison to terrorists worldwide and as overseer of
training camps in Afghanistan. Those Al Qaeda supporters, officials said,
could provide Abu Zubeida with harbor, financial and logistical support
and manpower needed to keep Al Qaeda going, even if Bin Laden is killed
or caught.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities cite a copy of Al Qaeda's plan for succession of power,
recently smuggled out of Afghanistan, which states that certain leaders
must flee as opposing forces are closing in, to ensure that the terrorist
network has the leadership it needs to live and fight another day.</TE>
<TE>   "Zubeida is the director of external affairs for Al Qaeda," said one
Bush administration official who confirmed the intensive manhunt for Abu
Zubeida. "As part of that, he ran the camp infrastructure, he brought
[terrorists] in, trained them and got them back to their country of
origin or the country Al Qaeda wanted to place them in.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very important cog in the machinery and certainly . . . after
Bin Laden is gone, would be someone who would take over," said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He is someone we are
extremely interested in."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida is the man believed responsible for putting Bin Laden's
plans into action, officials said. He has played a direct role in
orchestrating most, if not all, of the group's recent attacks, they
added. Those include the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa in
1998, which killed 224 people, and plots to blow up Los Angeles
International Airport and tourist sites in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida also has been Al Qaeda's global emissary, slipping
undetected from one country to another. Of those in Bin Laden's inner
circle, "he is the one who travels," said one senior counterterrorism
official from the Clinton administration. "He's good at that
stuff--traveling around the world with fake names, assumed passports, and
he is very good at disguise. I don't think anyone knows where he is, even
though everyone would love to find him."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida has used at least 37 aliases and accompanying fake
passports and identification documents from Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan and perhaps Morocco, according to a confidential U.S.
investigative document obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   So little is known about Abu Zubeida that even his country of origin
and his age are in question. Some identity documents indicate he was born
in Saudi Arabia, but authorities say he is a Palestinian from the Gaza
Strip. Few photos of him exist, and it is unclear how he became such an
important confidant of Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>Trips to Europe, Africa</TE>
<TE>   For years, Abu Zubeida operated an Al Qaeda safe house in Peshawar,
Pakistan, and has frequently moved between that country and Afghanistan,
often going underground for long periods only to resurface and resume his
role as an Al Qaeda chieftain, said one FBI counterterrorism agent.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably in Pakistan," the agent said. "He prefers it there."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida also has traveled extensively to Europe, Asia and Africa
to orchestrate and activate terrorist plots, maintain liaisons with
terror cells and screen would-be guerrillas for training, according to
the FBI and other U.S. counterterrorism authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida was never charged in the embassy bombings or the
millennium plots against LAX and the Jordanian tourist sites, although he
has been linked to them by intelligence reports, law enforcement
investigations and the testimony of Al Qaeda turncoats, including
convicted millennium plotter Ahmed Ressam. Authorities believe he also
played a role in the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen in
October 2000, which killed 17 soldiers, as well as the foiled suicide
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Paris last year.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Sept. 11 attacks, authorities believe Abu Zubeida acted as
an intermediary between Bin Laden and those directly involved in the
plot, including the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an implementer; he takes the orders from Bin Laden and
translates them into operational plans and implements them," said Vince
Cannistraro, former counter-terrorism chief for the CIA, who is familiar
with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Now Abu Zubeida "is activating the worldwide networks on behalf of Bin
Laden," said Cannistraro, citing CIA sources. "He is the guy who is
trying to implement the next terrorist operation . . . but they don't
know where he is.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be in [Afghanistan] but he may be outside," added Cannistraro.
"What they do know is that money is flowing and that the cells seem to be
moving and active and that the worldwide network reported back to him and
through him to Bin Laden. So Abu Zubeida is perhaps the most important
guy out there."</TE>
<TE>Search Dates to 1998</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Pakistan's government turned over to the U.S.
military a top aide to Abu Zubeida, Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi, who allegedly
ran Al Qaeda's Khalden training camp under Abu Zubeida's supervision.
Authorities hope that interrogations of Al-Libi and other Al Qaeda
detainees might shed more light on what role Abu Zubeida played in the
Sept. 11 attacks, and about his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Abu Zubeida has traveled as a honey salesman and in other
disguises, to such disparate locations as Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of
Africa where Al Qaeda is strong, including Sudan and Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   As "emir" of Khalden and about five other camps, Abu Zubeida met with
many members of Al Qaeda cells from around the world and has maintained
relationships with them, the FBI agent said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hunt for Abu Zubeida has intensified significantly, it is
not new. High-level counter-terrorism officials in the Clinton and Bush
administrations confirm that they have been searching for him since at
least 1998, after the embassy bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 2000, the Clinton administration dispatched a team of
high-ranking counterterrorism authorities to Sudan to investigate a
thriving Al Qaeda cell and to apprehend Abu Zubeida, who intelligence
reports had indicated was there for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were literally hours behind him . . . and he slipped through our
fingers," recalled one former State Department counterterrorism official
involved in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the official said, Abu Zubeida "got tipped off to us. He is a
very crafty fellow."</TE>
<TE>   The mission was highly classified, and authorities would not discuss
in detail what they believe Abu Zubeida was doing in Sudan. "He was just
floating through; 'transiting' is what we call it," the official said.
"You can guess what he was doing--planning."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Zubeida was not listed by President Bush in October as one of the
22 most-wanted terrorists. Some authorities attributed that omission to
Abu Zubeida's ability to fly below the radar. And now, as coalition
forces seek Bin Laden and Zawahiri, that low profile may ultimately work
to Abu Zubeida's advantage.</TE>

<HD>Mentally Scarred for Life by Massacre</HD>
<DH>Witnesses to the 1976 Cal State Fullerton rampage are examples of
how such trauma can continue to torment survivors for decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lenore Alvillar-Aguilar marched into the Cal State Fullerton
library an eager freshman, the first in her family to attend college. She
emerged an hour later trembling and crying, a witness to one of the worst
mass shootings in California history.</LD>
<LD>   Seven people died and two were wounded in the 1976 rampage by a
university janitor named Edward Charles Allaway. Alvillar-Aguilar and
dozens of others got out of the white concrete building without a
scratch.</LD>
<LD>   But that does not mean they were unscathed.</LD>
<TE>   Alvillar-Aguilar eventually dropped out of college, unable to cope
with the anxiety that rocked her anew each time she stepped onto campus.
A library receptionist who survived that day said she developed
alcoholism that tore her family apart and eventually led her to the
welfare line and jail. One library employee, tormented by guilt over
being off the day of the shooting, committed suicide eight months later.</TE>
<TE>   The violence at the university library doesn't approach the scale of
more recent mass killings, let alone the losses experienced at the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. But because a quarter of a century has
passed, these survivors' experiences provide a striking glimpse into the
long-term effects of being a spectator to violence.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with a group of people who found themselves in Allaway's
direct path underscore the mysterious and highly individual ways in which
trauma plays out.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the emotional wounds were immediately visible. Others coped
for years until a "trigger" forced them to confront the trauma.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorism was just one of the triggers that has made
recent months difficult for Cal State Fullerton survivors. Allaway--who
was found not guilty by reason of insanity--made an unsuccessful bid to
be released from a state mental hospital. Backed by some the hospital's
doctors, Allaway argued that his mental illness was in remission. But a
judge last month ruled that Allaway remains a danger to society and
should remain incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have big brains and good memories and they often are helpful to
us," said Stanford psychiatrist David Spiegel, an expert in
post-traumatic stress disorder who set up a Web site to help monitor
survivors of the World Trade Center attacks. "But they also keep in our
consciousness things that have been profoundly disturbing."</TE>
<TE>Karen Dwinell</TE>
<TE>   Although most students were home for the summer, the basement of the
Cal State Fullerton library was a busy place on July 12, even at 8:30 on
a Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Graphic artists, counselors and janitors roamed in and out of tiny
offices, their voices echoing in narrow hallways. In Room 40,
receptionist Karen Dwinell was listening to her colleague Paul Herzberg
talk about a recent European vacation when she spotted the janitor moving
toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Allaway shoved the barrel of a .22-caliber rifle into her chest.</TE>
<TE>   Herzberg, who had been sitting on Dwinell's desk, stepped to his feet
to defend her. Allaway turned and shot him in the heart.</TE>
<TE>   The janitor then shot a third employee in the office, Bruce Jacobson,
who collapsed into Dwinell's arms. Allaway then moved to a different
office and kept shooting.</TE>
<TE>   It must have been 15 minutes, maybe longer, before Dwinell built up
the courage to step out of the office. She reached the hallway, looked
into the graphic arts office and saw a pair of legs, motionless on the
floor. She turned and tried to run, but stumbled, her platform shoes
slipping on bullet shells.</TE>
<TE>   "They're dying all around me!" she remembers screaming as she climbed
up the stairs that led to the university quad.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of questioning by police, Dwinell was allowed to go home.
She stopped at a friend's home that night and opened a bottle of liquor.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat and I drank and I drank," Dwinell recalls.</TE>
<TE>   She did not get counseling. She worked at the Fullerton campus for the
next 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I walked down that hall, I could see myself fumbling for
the keys and stumbling over the shells and wondering whether he was going
to come from around the corner," Dwinell said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwinell developed a breathing exercise to deal with recurring panic
attacks. She'd hold her breath and count slowly to 30.</TE>
<TE>   She also began to lose hope for the future. She said she started to
despise herself. The only time she felt better was when she was drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I ruined relationships. I ignored my children, the problems they were
having. I was constantly drowning myself in my own sorrows. I blamed
myself for not being killed that day." She thought about suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Dwinell, now 58, said she put her drinking problem behind her about
six years ago, thanks in large part to a self-improvement group she said
helped restore her confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I like myself now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But her fears and anxiety come flooding back whenever she thinks about
that day.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time there's a school shooting, it brings it all back," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I can relate," she said of the survivors. "The people that lived
through it, they probably will have nightmares forever."</TE>
<TE>Monica Silbas</TE>
<TE>   After shooting his first two victims, Allaway marched down the narrow,
windowless hallway toward 16-year-old Monica Silbas, who was backed
against a wall in the library basement. The man with the rifle turned
toward her, but didn't fire. Instead, he shot into a graphic arts studio,
striking artist Frank Teplansky twice in the back and once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Silbas, who was on campus as part of a special program for high school
students, dashed into an office, locked the door and began praying. After
about 20 minutes of hearing nothing, Silbas climbed a stairwell and
stepped out of the library. She could not speak. She would not move.
Paramedics rushed her to a hospital, where she lay in a coma-like state
for a week.</TE>
<TE>   After two weeks, she was released from the hospital and almost
immediately taken by detectives back to the library basement to describe
the day of the shootings. Her face started twitching. Her hands shook. A
doctor who accompanied her on the visit ordered her to leave the campus
at once.</TE>
<TE>   Silbas returned to Santa Ana Valley High School, went on to Sacramento
State University, married and became an airline labor consultant. She
believed she had put those moments at the Cal State Fullerton library
behind her.</TE>
<TE>   Then, about 1991, some 15 years after the shootings, she returned to
the Fullerton campus to visit a memorial the university erected for the
seven slain victims.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I stepped foot on that campus I started to shake. I had no
control over it. I just started crying," Silbas said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the onset of another panic attack, she climbed back in her car
and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists say Silbas experienced classic delayed post-traumatic
stress.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the University of Minnesota and the Veteran Affairs
Medical Center recently studied 244 World War II veterans and found that
84% of them suffered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,
including some who experienced their first symptoms decades after the
war--such as at retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "If they stayed active they were OK," said Judith Herman, a Harvard
psychiatry professor. "But when they got ill or had a lot of free time
they had experiences of feeling hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   Silbas, 42, who now lives in Maryland, said she still hopes to return
to the Fullerton campus again.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep saying I have to go back," Silbas said. "I have to close that
part of it."</TE>
<TE>Kathy Morris</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Morris was sorting library cards when she heard the gunfire. She
suspected someone was lighting firecrackers, so she left her desk to
investigate.</TE>
<TE>   What Morris saw next was Allaway shooting 32-year-old library employee
Stephen Becker.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said she gathered as many employees as she could, dragged them
into an office and locked the door. She hid under a desk and dialed
campus police.</TE>
<TE>   The next few days were a blur.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I went to Steve's funeral," she said, "but I don't remember
it."</TE>
<TE>   Like Karen Dwinell, Morris did not seek counseling before she returned
to work. A single mother of three small children, Morris said she felt
she had no choice but to keep working.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, that wasn't real smart," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, now 57 and living in Yorba Linda, said "to this day the Fourth
of July is not my favorite holiday. Even though I enjoy fireworks,
anything that sounds like gunshots is a little unnerving."</TE>
<TE>   All told, though, Morris feels she's gotten through it remarkably
well. What enables some people to handle trauma as years pass better than
others is a topic of much interest among trauma-stress experts.</TE>
<TE>   "As a psychiatrist I find it far more meaningful what the person
brought to the trauma than how they were traumatized," said Frank
Ochberg, a Michigan State University psychiatry professor.</TE>
<TE>Jason Fenton</TE>
<TE>   By the time religious studies professor Jason Fenton saw Allaway, the
janitor was out of bullets, running from the library toward a parked car.
Fenton thought about trying to tackle the fleeing gunman, but instead ran
to check on the victims.</TE>
<TE>   He saw library worker Becker in a pool of blood. Fenton soon learned
that several of his friends had died.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Fenton, now 70, believes he was able to cope fairly well
with the events of that day. Like Morris, he said he was able to quickly
refocus on the rest of his life--something he attributes in large part to
his combat experience with Israel's defense forces in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   When he thinks of that day in 1976, his thoughts often turn not to his
own experiences but those of a colleague who suffered more profoundly.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the shootings, a young library employee approached
Fenton and talked about his grief. He had the day off on July 12 and was
spared Allaway's bullets. He told the professor that he felt guilty he
was not able to protect his friends. He said he could hear the victims'
voices when he was alone in the university's audio-visual studio.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the voices were telling him he should have been with them,"
said co-worker Michael Casey.</TE>
<TE>   About 8 1/2 months after the shootings, the young employee handed his
wristwatch to a co-worker. "I'm not going to need this anymore," he said.
He climbed to the fifth floor of the campus Humanities Building and
jumped off a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Feelings of guilt and grief are common among survivors of tragedy,
research has shown. Spiegel, the Stanford psychiatrist, said he noticed
the same symptoms among survivors of a 1993 mass shooting at a San
Francisco law office that left eight dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that was most striking, everyone was affected, even the
people who weren't there, who'd gone home early. They felt guilty,"
Spiegel said. "These people feel in retrospect they should have been
there and they chickened out when there's no way in God's Earth they
could have known."</TE>
<TE>Lenore Alvillar-Aguilar</TE>
<TE>   Alvillar-Aguilar, the incoming freshman, was so excited about
attending Cal State Fullerton that she arrived in a counselor's office
more than an hour before a scheduled orientation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was telling me, 'You have a real bright future,' and then all of a
sudden we heard shots," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 15 minutes, she hid under a desk. The counselor
eventually led her through the office, where she sidestepped bodies on
her way out of the building.</TE>
<TE>   "The bullet holes were very small. They weren't breathing. I felt very
bad because I couldn't help them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   About a month later, Alvillar-Aguilar began her freshman year. But
whenever she set foot on campus, her heart would start racing and she'd
feel sick to her stomach.</TE>
<TE>   If an assignment required a library visit, she'd either skip it or
drive to her native East Los Angeles and use a community college library.
In one semester, she'd had enough. And 25 years later, Alvillar-Aguilar
still has no bachelor's degree.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't like to think of themselves as changed from these events
or having a lifelong influence from something that was a few moments'
duration, but that is what happens," said Dr. Lenore Terr, a San
Francisco psychiatrist who studied the effects on Chowchilla
schoolchildren who were buried alive during a 1976 kidnapping. "When you
talk to kids who've been traumatized, they seem to believe they have no
future. They give up on themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Alvillar-Aguilar, now 43, said that when she goes to work each day as
a clerk at a large government building, she will sometimes plot out in
her mind how she'll respond if there is some type of an attack. The
terrorism of Sept. 11 has made things worse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so depressing," she said. "So many victims--living and dead."</TE>
<TE>   At a psychologist's urging, she filled a journal with detailed
memories of the shooting. This summer, she returned to the library
basement for the first time in a quarter of a century. The drive took
about 25 minutes from her home in Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   A recent remodeling dramatically changed the basement, but the feeling
was still the same: narrow halls that wound like a maze, with offices
stacked against each other. She tried to figure out where the office was.
She pointed out where she saw the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here was part of the healing process for me," she said. "I'm
no longer afraid. I'm sad about it. But I'm glad I made it away."</TE>
<TE>   'The people that lived through it, they probably will have nightmares
forever.'</TE>

<HD>Davis Pledges No Tax Hikes in State Speech</HD>
<DH>Politics: But governor stops short of saying he would block
legislative attempts to raise taxes. He focuses on education, health care
and terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis delivered his final State of the State address of
his term Tuesday evening, promising to protect education and other
programs while vowing not to propose new taxes to close an anticipated
$12-billion budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing on television statewide, Davis laced his election-year
speech with references to Sept. 11, and proclaimed that no state has done
more to protect itself against terrorism. Then, he urged even more:
broader wiretap authority, higher pay for National Guard troops posted
around California and additional spending to stimulate the economy.</LD>
<LD>   In the budget proposal he will release on Thursday, Davis told
lawmakers and other officials he will increase education spending, boost
after-school programs by $75 million and expand health care for 100,000
additional children of low-income parents. At the same time, he said he
"will not increase taxes."</LD>
<TE>   But Davis was careful not to say that he would block all tax hikes
pushed by legislators. Several key legislators already have expressed
support for tax increases to pay for various state programs and fill the
multibillion-dollar deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not advocate raising taxes," Davis said. "That would further
burden individuals and businesses struggling to stay afloat in these
difficult economic times."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' remarks amounted to an opening of his reelection campaign, and
he used much of his speech to enumerate his successes: expanded spending
on schools, transportation and health care, and $4.6 billion in tax cuts,
most of which were enacted during his Republican predecessor's final
term.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Republican foes--and some fellow Democrats--viewed the speech
more as a campaign event than as a traditional opening of the legislative
session.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good campaign speech," said Senate Republican Leader Jim
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, adding that Davis "took a lot of credit for a
lot of things he had nothing to do with." Brulte said the governor's
promise that he would not be an advocate for new taxes was "a little less
than forceful."</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who missed all
but the final five minutes of Davis' speech, said the governor announced
his support for new programs just months after he vetoed bills that would
have created them.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's an election year," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Several legislators said Davis equivocated on tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) said Davis' statement on
taxes was "clever phraseology to be sure. But I think he is sincere. He
is sending messages to us as legislators [who support tax increases] to
tread with caution."</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature must approve the budget by a two-thirds majority,
meaning that some Republicans must join with the Legislature's
overwhelmingly Democratic majority in order to approve the document. That
is an especially difficult challenge in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   Few Republicans are likely to vote for a budget that includes
significant tax hikes, while many Democrats will oppose one that cuts
deeply into social programs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the difficult budget debates ahead, Davis' speech was largely
upbeat, emphasizing the underlying strength of the California economy and
arguing that the state is well-positioned to bounce back from any
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Davis gave few details of the budget he will release Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But he said public education "will be protected above all else," and
added that he will push to boost spending on schools and public safety,
while also expanding the Healthy Families insurance program for 100,000
additional children and ensuring that state financial aid to local
government continues.</TE>
<TE>   He offered no specific prescription for closing what could be a budget
shortfall of as much as $12 billion other than to say: "I will call on
you to close the budget gap with a combination of cutbacks, deferred
spending, internal borrowing and accelerated revenue."</TE>
<TE>   He also called on lawmakers to cut $2 billion from the current year's
budget: "Failure to act quickly on these cuts will only increase the pain
for our fellow citizens who depend on the state for vital services."</TE>
<TE>   In a move aimed at stimulating the economy, Davis promised to send
lawmakers a $678-million bond package to speed construction of public
works projects. He also renewed his call on lawmakers to place $30
billion in school construction bonds on statewide ballots, with votes
starting this November and continuing in 2004 and 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The governor called for a Cabinet-level labor secretary and
reorganization of the state's $4.6-billion job training system, saying it
now is composed of 34 separate programs in 13 different agencies. He
promised to streamline the programs and "achieve greater accountability
and efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Davis said he will offer legislation to address the
nursing shortage, an issue that affects the state and nation. However, he
did not provide details, other than to say he seeks to "remove barriers
to qualified licensed nurses moving to California from other states and
other countries."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis' State of the State address focused on the energy
crisis and steps he was proposing to solve it. This year, the governor
cited his handling of the problem as a success, pointing out that several
new power plants had been built, and that the state averted blackouts
last summer that had been predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "By doing so, we protected public health and safety, prevented a
meltdown of our economy, kept businesses from leaving the state--and even
created new jobs through expansions that were put on hold earlier in the
year," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the speech revolved around terrorism and its impact on the
state.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the security-related proposals he offered on Tuesday,
the governor used the address to single out some of those most affected
by the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Davis acknowledged six survivors of victims of the attacks on New York
and Washington, D.C., who were in the gallery overlooking the Assembly
chambers as he delivered the speech. He also singled out Ingrid and Al
Solhaug, the mother and stepfather of Army Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser,
of Frazier Park, who was one of three Green Berets killed last month in
Afghanistan by an errant U.S. bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Davis pointed to other guests, including five county sheriffs,
representatives of police organizations, and a fire chief who coordinated
the California search and rescue teams that helped look for survivors at
the World Trade Towers.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that more than 100 Californians died in the Sept. 11 attacks,
Davis said: "Tonight, we dedicate ourselves to building a future worthy
of their sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   He urged lawmakers to make retroactive to Sept. 11 a $100-a-week
increase in unemployment benefits for people who lost their jobs after
Sept. 11. Davis signed legislation raising the benefits. The increase
went into effect this month, but applied only to people who have filed
for benefits since the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In a proposal that already has stirred debate, Davis called for
expanded wiretap authority for state and local police, allowing them to
use "roving wiretaps" so they can eavesdrop on any telephone used by a
suspect, rather than specific phones as is currently permitted. The
governor did not flesh out his proposal. But his aides said it would
grant state and local police power to intercept e-mail and eavesdrop on
Internet sites, similar to authority granted federal law enforcement in
the USA Patriot Act signed by President Bush in October.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of 25 states that use wiretaps--but while lawmakers
in other states have proposed allowing roving wiretaps, no other states
have adopted such an expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration erroneously stated on Monday that New York
approved the use of roving wiretaps. But in fact, while the New York
Senate has approved such a measure, the Democrat-controlled Assembly in
New York has yet to act on it. Lawmakers in Florida and Illinois did
expand wiretap authority after the Sept. 11 attacks, but no state has
gone as far as sanctioning roving wiretaps.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Tuesday Davis' proposal
mirrors new wiretap legislation that his office has been working on for
months. Cooley's proposed legislation, like Davis', would let police use
wiretaps on any phone that targeted suspects use, rather than specific
phone numbers as now permitted.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, floated by Davis aides earlier this week, is opposed by some
civil libertarians and Democratic lawmakers, including the influential
Burton.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, USC law professor
Erwin Chemerinsky said Tuesday that the problem--suspected criminals
frequently change phones, while warrants authorizing wiretaps are limited
to specific phone numbers--could be solved by creating "a more
expeditious procedure for the police to use to add new numbers to an
existing warrant."</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction to Sept. 11 has been completely understandable," said
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), who held a hearing on
anti-terrorism legislation earlier Tuesday. "But . . . let's make sure we
are deliberative and analytical."</TE>

<HD>Internet Scam Had Its Attractions</HD>
<DH>Investments: Some victims say they suspected fraud but kept
playing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after a Mission Viejo teenager was accused of bilking
investors out of $1 million in an Internet-based scheme, some of those
who lost money said they suspected it was a scam all along--but got in
anyway in the hope of earning a quick payout.</LD>
<LD>   These investors said they regularly comb the Internet in search of
various "investment" programs in which the strategy is to jump in early
and secure a fast profit before the program collapses.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, court records showed that the accused youth's family
struggled financially in the 1990s, making two appearances in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in the last nine years.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that
17-year-old Cole A. Bartiromo operated a scheme that fraudulently
advertised "risk-free" returns of as much as 2,500%. The SEC said more
than 1,000 participants worldwide sent money to Bartiromo, apparently
duped in part by the urbane persona that he adopted online.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo agreed to settle the SEC case without admitting or denying
guilt and to return $900,000 he had sent to an account at a Costa Rican
casino.</TE>
<TE>   The case was only the second time that the SEC has filed charges
against a minor for running an investment scheme, and it raised new
questions about the potential for technology-savvy teens to be lured into
Internet-based fraud.</TE>
<TE>   However, some who got involved in the program described Bartiromo's
"Invest Better 2001" as one of many such Net-based "games" in which early
entrants hope to profit while being on constant alert for warning signs
that the program is unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't believe any of these are legitimate when I start
them," said Heather Wallace, a homemaker and mother of two in Fort Riley,
Kan., who said she lost $715 in Bartiromo's program. "If you're not
figuring that 90% of them are scams, you're in the wrong line of
business."</TE>
<TE>Initially Scheme Made Good on Its Promises</TE>
<TE>   Miki Terry, an investor in Charlotte, N.C., who said she lost $800
with Bartiromo's game, said most of these games are "illegal or
borderline-illegal pyramid schemes, multilayer marketing plans, chain
letters and Ponzi schemes."</TE>
<TE>   In a classic Ponzi scheme, investors are promised huge returns, and
the earliest entrants are paid with money collected from later entrants,
giving the program the initial appearance of legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo promised to pay high returns by making sports bets with
participants' funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors said they lost money in Bartiromo's program only
because there was little sign of trouble before the scheme suddenly
disintegrated during the first week of December.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Invest Better 2001 apparently made good on its promises.
Shortly after the scheme was launched in November, many investors said
they received payouts from Bartiromo.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Hatch, an investor in St. Anne's-on-the-Sea in northern England,
initially put in $2,000 and was paid $4,000 in return, she said. Hatch
plowed that money back into the plan and took out $8,000. At that point
she made her "big plunge," investing nearly $27,000--which now appears to
be lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all very seductive," Hatch said. "At the end of the day, greed
got the better of us all."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch was taken in by the seeming professionalism of "Tom Manning,"
the alias used by Bartiromo.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly did not think I was in contact with someone of only 17
years old. The language used in the e-mails was mature and to some extent
worldly wise and also witty at times," Hatch said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in one dispatch to investors, Bartiromo said: "There is
nothing illegal going on here, just those that want to join together to
form success are doing just that. Big Brother and the SEC don't want to
see any program work for a variety of reasons. Revenue escapes from their
tax base and they can't have Johnny Lunchbucket make easy untaxed dollars
from these programs. This goes against the grain!"</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bartiromo's investors said they troll the Internet in search
of similar programs, which appear to go by a variety of names, including
"gold games."</TE>
<TE>   Some investors said they commit small amounts to the games. Sometimes
they lose money right away and move on to the next game, they said. If
they receive a payout, they attempt to keep playing. They say that the
games almost always collapse and that the trick is to watch for signs as
to when that's happening. Those signs can include late or missed payouts,
delayed answers to investor questions or complaints, sudden rumors or the
disappearance of a Web site, Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   Terry described the games as so-called biz opps, where the strategy is
to "skim the cream" before they fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials would not comment as to whether Bartiromo's investors
themselves might have broken securities laws. But other experts doubted
that was the case. Securities laws are aimed mainly at the people
operating schemes.</TE>
<TE>   According to one victim, Bartiromo used stalling tactics to avoid
paying investors as the game progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Neville Sison, another English investor, said that under the Manning
alias, Bartiromo asked him not to complain to Evocash, one of the
e-commerce sites used to move funds between investors and Bartiromo. "You
will only lock the funds forever this way, if you complain to Evocash.
Please tell them it was [a] misunderstanding," Bartiromo told Sison in an
e-mail on Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, Evocash responded to Sison's inquiry, saying, "The
account in question has been closed by the account holder and is no
longer in use."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo, who friends described as an avid sports memorabilia
collector with his father, told investors he was betting on professional
football games and other sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   "He would list the positions he had on upcoming games on the forum,"
Terry said. "He would say how much he was betting on a team and that he
was covering his bets in various ways, sometimes making two or three bets
on the same game."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo would paste copies of betting forms from a Las Vegas sports
book on the Web to convince investors that he was putting money into
wagers, Terry said. But it isn't known whether any bets actually were
placed.</TE>
<TE>Teen's Family Had Financial Problems</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo used a system of juggling funds between numerous e-commerce
sites to evade regulators, according to an e-mail he sent to one
investor.</TE>
<TE>   The funds "are almost always in transit, being transferred from a
sports book and back," Bartiromo said in the e-mail. "When they are
transferred back, even then, we hold all the funds in a 'unknown' account
to the public to protect the funds from hacking attempts which could
freeze accounts and delay the program. Also, this protects us against Big
Brother or the SEC or what have you ever being able to freeze funds, as
they will not be able to get to them."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's lawyer did not return phone calls Monday or Tuesday. How
the youth came up with the scheme idea--and whether he had help--remain
unclear. But more details emerged Tuesday about his family.</TE>
<TE>   His parents first filed for bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Santa Ana in early 1993, when their combined bill payments
exceeded their $2,800 monthly take-home income by nearly $200 a month.
Among the debts they listed was $4,000 owed on a time-share at the Jockey
Club Resort in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1993 the court discharged the debts, wiping the slate clean
for the Bartiromos to start over.</TE>
<TE>   But four years later, Bartiromo's father, John Bartiromo, a Southern
California Edison employee, filed another bankruptcy petition after
falling more than $23,000 in arrears on his mortgage, and the lender sent
a statement that put the total owed at $237,419.</TE>
<TE>   John Bartiromo proposed paying $500 a month for 36 months to wipe out
the default. The court quickly approved a proposed plan of repayment, but
a month later, in May 1997, the court dismissed the case and prohibited
him from filing another bankruptcy petition for six months.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Bartiromo was the talk of Trabuco Hills High School on Tuesday as
well as on the baseball field, where he surprised teammates and coaches
by showing up for practice.</TE>
<TE>   Some classmates described him almost in heroic terms, saying what he
did was smart and gutsy, according to students.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't think what he did is a bad thing," said P.J.
Sandoval, a teammate on Bartiromo's baseball team. "They're amazed how a
minor can pull off such an intricate scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sandoval didn't think Bartiromo was much of a hero, he said:
"I think it's a huge deal, especially with the amount of money he took
and the number of people he took it from. He had to be pretty patient,
tenacious and risky. But he was pretty genius too."</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval said Bartiromo's case was discussed in his civics class.
"Kids were asking, did he commit the crime or was it the stupid people
who fell for his scheme?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the players asked Bartiromo how he pulled off such a scheme by
himself. But none of them got any answers, Sandoval said.</TE>

<HD>Bavarian Leader Bucks Tradition, Eyes Nomination</HD>
<DH>Germany: Gov. Edmund Stoiber makes a play against main party chief
for the chance to run against Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>With the polite observation that he would run for chancellor if
asked, Bavaria state Gov. Edmund Stoiber kicked off this year's German
election campaign Tuesday and opened a second front in the political
battle--with his own conservative allies.</LD>
<LD>   The role of chancellor candidate usually falls to the head of the
country's main conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union. The
only time that Stoiber's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union, usurped the honor of putting forward a challenger was in 1980,
when Franz Josef Strauss went down to a defeat of historic proportions.</LD>
<LD>   But the Christian Democrats' leader, Angela Merkel, has so failed to
inspire conservatives that support has measurably wandered toward the
charismatic, if often controversial, Stoiber in the search for a
challenger with any chance of unseating Social Democratic incumbent
Gerhard Schroeder.</LD>
<TE>   "The CSU has created clarity. Now it's the CDU's move," Friedrich
Merz, parliamentary leader for both conservative parties, observed
Tuesday in what amounted to a call for Merkel, who also recently
expressed her desire to run for chancellor, to step aside.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews ahead of this week's Christian Socialist campaign
strategy meeting in the Bavarian spa town of Wildbad Kreuth, Stoiber let
it be known that after three decades in Bavaria's political trenches,
he's ready to make the leap to national politics in the Sept. 22 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is the desire of both parties, I am prepared to place myself in
the service of our common cause," Stoiber told the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper before the conference, urging the two conservative party
hierarchies to make their choice soon.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, in a speech to fellow party leaders, he vowed to ensure a
harmonious approach to the election with Merkel's Christian Democratic
Union. Despite the professions of solidarity, however, his declaration
amounts to an end run around Merkel that has been hailed by party
stalwarts. Merkel might be the politically correct choice, they
acknowledge, but she appears destined to lose.</TE>
<TE>   "It is right and necessary that we have someone leading this campaign
who has both the personal success and grasp of matters to feel at home
with these complicated themes," leading Christian Socialist lawmaker
Michael Glos said of Stoiber's experience governing Germany's most
prosperous state.</TE>
<TE>   Glos urged Merkel to do what is best for the conservative cause and
support Stoiber.</TE>
<TE>   As architect of the "laptops and lederhosen" economic formula that has
developed high-tech industries alongside traditional tourism, Stoiber has
led Bavaria out of the economic morass afflicting the rest of the country
and much of Europe. That regional track record positions him well to
spotlight Schroeder's greatest weaknesses--his failure to reduce
unemployment and the evaporation of the country's short-lived growth
trend during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Merkel, 47, has support in the formerly Communist eastern states,
where she grew up, and among many conservative women. But she has never
governed a state, and her only public administration experience was a
brief term as environment minister under her mentor, former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.</TE>
<TE>   Merkel is credited with leading the conservatives out of the scandal
that followed the discovery two years ago that Kohl and his lieutenants
had routinely accepted secret campaign donations that investigators have
construed as bribes. But she has failed to put any personal stamp on the
party and is often overshadowed by its more established members.</TE>
<TE>   Opinion polls indicate that the 60-year-old Stoiber is likely to fare
far better than Merkel in a race against Schroeder, although neither
conservative is outpacing the left-of-center chancellor at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by the Forsa research institute which candidate would put up the
better fight, 68% of 2,509 respondents chose Stoiber, compared with 20%
for Merkel, this week's Die Woche newspaper reported. The pollsters also
found that only 29% of voters would support Merkel against 50% for
Schroeder, whereas a Stoiber candidacy would result in a split of only 8
percentage points, with Schroeder garnering 44% to the Bavarian's 36%.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, even Merkel appeared to acknowledge the inevitability of a
Stoiber campaign. She told a late-night talk show that the conservatives
should run the candidate "who has the best chance of winning."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Schroeder's current lead and enduring popularity, the choice
of a challenger is more than a formality. Political analysts expect
German voters to begin focusing on their economic woes as the campaign

<HD>China Vows to Prosecute Bible Detainee</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing warns against foreign meddling in behalf of an
indicted Hong Kong businessman.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>China warned foreign governments Tuesday not to meddle in its
internal affairs as it vowed to press ahead with plans to prosecute a
Hong Kong businessman who allegedly carried thousands of Bibles into
mainland China for distribution to a banned fundamentalist Christian
group.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said that the businessman,
38-year-old Li Guangqiang, "broke Chinese laws and will be dealt with
according to Chinese laws."</LD>
<LD>   "No other country should interfere in China's judicial independence,"
Sun added.</LD>
<TE>   His remarks came in the wake of reports indicating that President Bush
had taken a personal interest in Li's case and had requested that the
State Department look into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is deeply concerned about these reports," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday. "Reports of a crackdown
on religious practitioners in China are deeply troubling."</TE>
<TE>   The law under which Li has been charged carries a maximum penalty of
death.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy opens a new chapter in the long and difficult
relationship between evangelical Christian groups and Communist Chinese
authorities deeply suspicious of their motives.</TE>
<TE>   Some China-watchers view Li's detention as part of a broader crackdown
in the run-up to this autumn's 16th Communist Party Congress, when the
successor to President Jiang Zemin and a new generation of Chinese
leaders will be selected.</TE>
<TE>   Li, a member of the Hong Kong branch of the Anaheim-based Local
Church, transported more than 30,000 copies of the New Testament Recovery
Version of the Bible into China's Fujian province last spring, according
to information from the official indictment obtained by the Hong
Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights organization's director, Frank Lu Siqing, said the
Bibles were apparently headed for distribution to an underground
Protestant sect known as Shouters, which the Chinese government banned in
1995, declaring it a cult.</TE>
<TE>   Nee Tosheng, also known as Watchman Nee, founded the Local Church in
China in the 1920s. He was jailed by the Communists in the early 1950s on
accusations of leading a heretical cult and died in custody 20 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Church claims about 30,000 members worldwide. Each
congregation is named for its location, with the branch Li attended, for
example, known simply as the Church in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   A church spokesman in Hong Kong, D.J. Wong, said Tuesday that Li had
been a member for only a few months before his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Li was detained in the city of Fuqing in May along with two mainland
Chinese colleagues, Yu Zhudi and Lin Xifu. According to Hong Kong-based
human rights activist Lu, all three men have been held there since.</TE>
<TE>   As often happens in such instances, Li's relatives worked quietly for
months seeking his release but decided to publicize his plight after two
Local Church members in Hubei province were sentenced to death and a
third was given a term of life imprisonment after being convicted of
involvement with an "evil cult."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen other church members received lesser sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The crime of involvement with any group classified by the state as an
"evil cult" is part of a 1999 law drafted mainly for use in the
government's crackdown on the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement. It
has since turned into a convenient tool for punishing other
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment describes Li as a very, very, serious criminal," Lu
said. "After what happened in Hubei, the family became worried he was
going to get a death sentence."</TE>
<TE>   Li's family has also requested help from the government in Hong Kong,
which is a special administrative region of China. Patricia Mok, a Hong
Kong Security Bureau spokeswoman, said that although the government has
no power to challenge the legalities of the case, it is trying to help.</TE>
<TE>   "We can convey [family] requests and wishes, but we can't interfere in
the judicial affairs of a mainland province," she said. "We're trying to
offer the family what help we can."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 10 million Christians worship openly in China, and some
versions of the Bible are legal here. But there are also Christian sects
and versions of the Bible that are outlawed. The New Testament Recovery
Version, published by the Living Stream Ministry, also based in Anaheim,
is apparently among those declared illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Living Stream Ministry spokesman Chris Wilde
in Anaheim denied any link between his organization and either Li or the
Shouters.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any connection with them, and we really don't know that
much about them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment against Li, municipal prosecutors in
Fuqing claim that the New Testament Recovery Version is a principal text
of what they term "the Shouters Cult," from worshipers' practice of
loudly professing devotion to Christ.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, an Alameda County Superior Court awarded the Local Church
$11.9 million in damages in a landmark libel lawsuit against a
Berkeley-based cult-monitoring group. A book by the group had accused the
Local Church of espousing heretical teachings and exercising cult-like
control over its followers.</TE>

<HD>Archbishop of Canterbury to Retire</HD>
<DH>Religion: Candidates to succeed George Carey range from a
Pakistan-born expert on Islam to a former Oxford don to a royal family
ally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>The archbishop of Canterbury, who introduced female priests and
rock gospel to the Church of England, announced his retirement Tuesday as
the spiritual leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans and
Episcopalians.</LD>
<LD>   George Carey, 66, said he will step down Oct. 31 after Queen Elizabeth
II's Golden Jubilee celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   "By the end of October, I shall have served 11 1/2 years in a
demanding yet wonderfully absorbing and rewarding post," Carey said. "I
feel certain this will be the right and proper time to stand down. I look
forward to exciting opportunities and challenges in the coming months,
and then to fresh ones in the years that follow."</LD>
<TE>   He gave no further explanation for his retirement, but he once called
the job "very wearying" and reportedly wants to give his successor ample
time to prepare for the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference of Anglican
bishops in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop of Canterbury--a post first held by St. Augustine 1,400
years ago and once filled by Thomas a Becket--is the leader of the
Anglican Communion, which groups autonomous churches in more than 160
countries. He is also the primate of all England, a symbolic role that
Carey has used to foster interfaith dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Carey has also worked hard to maintain peace between the liberal and
conservative wings of his divided church, which will vie in a secret
selection process to fill his post. The front-runners include a
Pakistan-born expert on Islam, a former Oxford University don known as a
liberal and a conservative ally of the royal family.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not an easy issue. The church is divided," said Grace Davie, an
expert on the Church of England at the University of Exeter. "It could be
considerably more divided. Carey has held it together by being generous
and sensitive to both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Although most archbishops of Canterbury have come from the Oxford- and
Cambridge-educated elite, Carey was the son of a hospital orderly from
London's working-class East End. He was selected by then-Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher from a list of two presented to her by the church
leadership and was installed in April 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He defied easy labels, supporting the 1992 decision to ordain women as
priests but opposing the ordination of practicing homosexuals. He sought
to shake up a fusty church by bringing in pop and gospel music and taking
God's work out to pubs and supermarkets. He has also arranged for Muslims
and other clergy to serve as prison chaplains--posts that by law should
be held by members of the Church of England.</TE>
<TE>   Davie said this, and Carey's efforts to foster interfaith
communication, shows that he takes seriously the work of the primate of
England.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a weak state church, but a weak state church is able to do
things strong churches are not able to do, such as to be an umbrella,"
Davie said. "Others view it as a protector rather than a threat. Carey
played that role well."</TE>
<TE>   But she added that although Carey was a caring archbishop, he was
never a great thinker or public speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "He is," she said, "more of a pastor than a prophet."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States and the
subsequent debate about relations between the Christian and Muslim
worlds, many observers think that the church will be looking for a more
dynamic leader who will focus on the role of religion in international
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Carey's successor will also have to grapple with the church's
dwindling membership--fewer than 1 million people attend Sunday services,
down from 3 million in 1950--and with continuing debates over women
becoming bishops, the role of gays in the church, Anglican union with the
Methodists and whether the church should agree to officiate at weddings
involving divorcees.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate heading most lists is the Rev. Michael Nazir-Ali, 52,
the Pakistan-born bishop of Rochester and a member of the church's
conservative wing. He is a respected authority on Christian-Muslim
relations who many people believe could help ease tensions between the
country's South Asian minorities and the white majority. But he has
raised the hackles of liberals with his comment that married couples who
choose not to have children are "self-indulgent."</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop of Wales, the Rev. Rowan Williams, 51, a former
professor of divinity at Oxford and charismatic intellectual, is said to
have support among liberals in the church. But his support for homosexual
clergy could rule him out among conservatives, and his outspoken nature
may not rest well with Prime Minister Tony Blair.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives are more likely to support Bishop of London Richard
Chartres, 54, who has close ties with the royal family and was chaplain
to Carey's predecessor, Robert Runcie. Blair is said to favor the bishop
of Liverpool, James Jones, 53.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise candidate could be Christopher Herbert, 58, bishop of St.
Albans, who is known for his speeches on moral issues in the House of
Lords.</TE>
<TE>   The process of picking a new Anglican leader is so secret that many
church members don't know exactly what goes on. After secret soundings
and deliberations inside and outside the church, the Crown Appointments
Commission will present a list of two candidates to the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Blair, a practicing Anglican who sometimes attends Mass with his Roman
Catholic wife and children, will pick one of those and present his choice
for ratification by the queen, the supreme governor of the Church of
England.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's spokesman told reporters that the prime minister has "great
admiration and respect for the work [Carey] has done guiding the church
through a period of change." The spokesman said Carey had labored
"tirelessly at home and abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the leader of Roman Catholics in
England and Wales, praised Carey's "immense integrity, zeal and courage"
and his collaboration on ecumenical endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   Political opposition leader Iain Duncan Smith said Carey's leadership
was particularly evident at the turn of the millennium, "when he gently
but patiently persisted in his belief that reflection upon 2,000 years of
Jesus Christ should be at the heart of the nation's celebrations."</TE>
<TE>   Carey, he added, "has been a remarkable church minister with a deep
sense of commitment to the idea of the parish and its service of people
of every background and need."</TE>

<HD>3 Israelis Reportedly Slain in Gaza</HD>
<DH>Mideast: 2 Palestinian gunmen are also killed during attack on an
army outpost, sources say. The gun battle shatters a weeklong lull in
fighting.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen attacked an Israeli army outpost on the border
with the Gaza Strip this morning, shooting dead three soldiers and
injuring six others, Israeli sources reported. Two Palestinian gunmen
were shot dead in the incident, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting shattered a lull in Israeli-Palestinian violence that
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had described Tuesday night
as the quietest week since the outbreak of fighting in September 2000.</LD>
<LD>   It came as the Bush administration is pressing both sides to impose a
cease-fire and return to negotiations, and it is bound to set back those
efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Details of the incident were sketchy because the army was withholding
information pending notification of relatives. However, knowledgeable
Israeli sources said a unit of Israeli Bedouin troops who were staffing a
border outpost near Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, close to the southern Gaza
border town of Rafiah, came under fire about 4:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The two Palestinian gunmen shot dead in the incident were reportedly
wearing Palestinian police uniforms. Palestinian sources reached in the
Gaza Strip said they could not independently confirm the reports.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio reported this morning that forces were on high alert
along the border with Gaza. Army Radio said a "military incident"
occurred.</TE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Vatican has quietly issued new rules for Roman Catholic
churches around the world to deal with priests accused of pedophilia,
saying they should stand trial in secret ecclesiastic courts.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II and the Vatican issued two documents on the problem
last year, but they weren't presented at news conferences or made public,
as is usually the case with such documents.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they were published in Latin without any fanfare in the
latest yearly volume of "Acta Apostolicae Sedis" (Acts of the Apostolic
See), the journal of record of the Holy See.</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, the church has been rocked by scandals involving
priests, and the Vatican has been grappling with how to control the
damage. In one of the most recent cases, the dioceses of Los Angeles and
Orange paid $5.2 million last year to settle allegations of priestly
sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   In the pope's document, known as a Motu Proprio, one of the highest
forms of papal directives, he authorized the Vatican's Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith to issue guidelines on how to deal with the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation, which deals
with matters of faith and morals, sent a letter to all bishops and heads
of religious orders outlining the Vatican's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "With this letter, we hope that not only will these serious crimes be
avoided but, above all, that the holiness of the clergy and the faithful
be protected by the necessary sanctions and by the pastoral care offered
by the bishops and others responsible," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratzinger said that if a local bishop or head of a religious order
becomes aware of "even a hint" of a case of pedophilia, "he must open an
investigation and inform the [Vatican] Congregation."</TE>
<TE>   A local church tribunal, made up of priests, should hear the case,
which could be referred to the Vatican, but the procedures would be
covered by church secrecy, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   The letter made no mention of whether a bishop should inform civil
authorities if a church court finds a priest guilty. A.W. Richard Sipe, a
La Jolla-based psychotherapist and expert on sexual abuse by priests and
former priests, said he had read only parts of the Vatican documents but
was troubled by the self-policing policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't ensure the kind of safeguards and oversights that a
problem of this size requires," he said. "You have abusers judging
abusers. It's like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Sipe said recent church history shows that too many bishops have kept
pedophile priests on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Tod M. Tamberg, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said the
Vatican documents mostly underscore what the Catholic Church in the U.S.
has been doing since 1994, including extending the statute of limitations
for 10 years past a victim's 18th birthday and defining a child as
someone under 18, as opposed to 16.</TE>
<TE>   "These norms, in combination with our own comprehensive policies on
sexual abuse, indicate how seriously the church takes its responsibility
to ensure the safety of our ministries, especially for children," Tamberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   Secret proceedings, he said, "protect the rights of both the accusers
and the accused . . . from the trauma of being put on public display."</TE>

<HD>Pretend Economy Fueling Argentina</HD>
<DH>Crisis: With a devaluation in the works, banks have no money,
businesses have no sales and residents try to eke out a living.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>These days, Horacio Costantino spends his days impersonating the
successful businessman he used to be. He picks up the phone at his marine
hardware store and makes calls all day--to his wife and mother, because
his clients have long since disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   He leafs through his ledger book and glances again and again at the
only sale he's recorded since November, for a mere $140. He calls the
bank to find out if a check he deposited two months ago has cleared yet.
It hasn't.</LD>
<LD>   "I went to the bank to withdraw some dollars," the 41-year-old says.
"They told me they were allowed to give them to me but they didn't have
any."</LD>
<TE>   Such is life in Argentina, a country living in an Alice-in-Wonderland
economy of banks without cash, where no one is exactly certain what the
real value of the local currency will be next week and where getting your
hands on any money at all is a test of endurance and wit.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's economic crisis has worked its way like a bad cold through
the streets of La Boca, a working-class district on the southern edge of
Buenos Aires famous for its colorful houses and successful soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   Like other parts of Argentina, La Boca is running on a phantom economy
as the country's politicians work feverishly to develop a recovery
program for this nation, burdened by high unemployment and a $135-billion
public debt.</TE>
<TE>   La Boca copes by little acts of "solidarity" among businesspeople,
family members and friends. At a collection of kiosks catering to
tourists, merchants share lunches and pay the bus fare home for those who
go a day without making any sales.</TE>
<TE>   Those who do have customers sell their goods at prices that are
floating gradually upward, following the recent devaluation of the peso
by nearly 30%, from parity to 1.4 to the dollar. Soon, the peso will also
float on the open market. With the peso suddenly worth less, the prices
of staples such as bread have already increased by about 30%.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the government said the devaluation would take effect
within 72 hours. But on Tuesday, officials said they would postpone the
move. A partial banking holiday will remain in force, including a freeze
on many transactions involving foreign currencies.</TE>
<TE>   The peso is already trading at a widely fluctuating rate on the black
market here, with some traders selling dollars for as much as 1.8 pesos.
Some economists have said the peso's value may drop to as low as 2.7 to
the dollar by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally confused," Sonia Villavicencio, 29, says as she sits
behind the counter of her kiosk in La Boca, offering Argentine
knickknacks to the sparse crowd of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   With the true value of the peso still in doubt, Villavicencio has
decided to place new stickers on all her goods listing the price in
dollars. Unfortunately, she's discovered that most people who pay with
the U.S. currency expect a big markdown that she can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   "My business isn't on solid ground right now," she says. Her suppliers
won't give her a fixed price for the T-shirts, guitars and wood-carved
mate cups she sells. One day recently, her sales totaled $20. Another
day, she sold even less and was forced to ask her neighbors for bus fare
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks be to God for my friends," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines have been living under a growing sense of doom for some
time now as the country has suffered through a four-year recession and a
fiscal crisis that has forced federal and local governments to slash
budgets and lay off thousands of employees.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government also has placed strict limits on bank
withdrawals, leaving consumers with less cash to spend. Those with
dollars--which were widely used here during the last decade--are hoarding
them until the devaluation sinks in. All those factors have contributed
to a situation in which very little cash is circulating on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take anything now," Dora Nieves, 81, says after a
customer pays for some produce with a patacon, a currency issued by a
neighboring province struggling to pay its debts.</TE>
<TE>   Without bothering to hide her disgust, she takes the one patacon bill
and places it in the register with similar notes.</TE>
<TE>   Nieves' employee, 53-year-old Roberto Benitez, says he just asked his
boss for a raise to cover the rising costs of utilities and staples.</TE>
<TE>   "What I make isn't enough to live on," he says. His 500-peso monthly
salary is now eclipsed by 800-peso living expenses. When his boss turned
down his request for a raise, there was nothing he could do. Unemployment
stands at 18% here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to take what little I have, because if I quit I'll
suffer even more," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Business transactions of all kinds have been thrown for a loop by the
economic crisis and the uncertainty of the last month, which has seen
riots, protests and five different men as president.</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Pache, a lawyer, says his clients owe him $2,500 in unpaid
bills for handling their divorces, wills and other matters of family law.
The middle of the workday finds him on a street corner in La Boca,
passing out fliers for a restaurant offering a "lunch with tango" show.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to help out the owner, who's my friend," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Costantino &amp; Son, the marine hardware store, Horacio
Costantino doesn't need much help. He's contemplating taking everything
he owns, selling it off and heading north for the United States, shutting
down for good the business his father founded.</TE>
<TE>   The $140 he last took in didn't even cover his phone bill. He lives
now, like many others, by spending his savings.</TE>
<TE>   He looks out at a shop filled with chains, heavy-duty grappling hooks,
anchors and other goods. "It took 40 years of work to build this," he
says, "and now it's being lost."</TE>

<TE>Rising Prices in Argentina</TE>
<TE>Prices are rising in Argentina on everything from bread to
electronics, as shortages and the upcoming devaluation of the
peso drive inflation. Spot checks show:</TE>

<HD>Premier and Cabinet Quit in Estonia</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TALLINN, Estonia
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Mart Laar resigned Tuesday, complaining of coalition
infighting that hampered his government and threatened Estonia's efforts
to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</LD>
<LD>   Laar, 41, told Parliament before Christmas that he would step down,
saying disputes in the three-party coalition--led by his center-right Pro
Patria party--"endanger key goals of Estonia."</LD>
<LD>   The Cabinet, which includes the center-right Reform Party and centrist
Moderates, automatically quits as a result of Laar's action. But the
Cabinet will stay on in a caretaker role until President Arnold Ruutel
nominates a new prime minister and Parliament approves a new Cabinet.</LD>
<TE>   Laar blamed the Reform Party for the friction, saying it betrayed him
by joining the opposition Center Party in a municipal government alliance
in Tallinn, the capital. Though the parties in the coalition were agreed
on joining the EU and NATO, it was feared that the party disputes could
hold up policies.</TE>

<HD>Deportation Sweep Targets Middle Easterners</HD>
<DH>Policy: Immigration officials will use FBI data to track those
previously ordered to leave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As part of a broad crackdown on illegal immigration following the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. officials are targeting as the priority
for deportation several thousand Middle Eastern men who have previously
been ordered to leave the country.</LD>
<LD>   The men, primarily from countries viewed as strongholds of the Al
Qaeda terrorist network, will be the first to have their names added to
the FBI criminal database under a new strategy to capture fugitives who
ignore deportation orders, the Justice Department said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Immigration officials last month announced plans to use FBI computers
to help locate more than 300,000 people--most from Latin America--who
have disappeared into U.S. society rather than be kicked out by
immigration judges.</LD>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials decided to focus first on the Middle Eastern
men, putting their names at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't enter 314,000 names all at once. It's going to take time. We
had to prioritize," a Justice Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   But civil rights groups and advocates for Arab Americans denounced the
new strategy Tuesday, saying that it is the latest in a series of law
enforcement actions that have unfairly subjected Middle Easterners to
profiling and targeted police actions.</TE>
<TE>   "It creates the impression that there is a two-tiered justice system:
one level for Muslims and Arab Americans and another for the rest of
society," said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy organization in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Non-Muslims also assailed the new policy. "We would be concerned that
it's a systematic profiling of Middle Easterners--and that it reflects a
bias toward Middle Easterners that we don't find acceptable," said Kevin
Appleby, director of migration and refugee policy for the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The effort was first reported in the Washington Post, which said it
would apply to about 6,000 Middle Eastern men. Justice Department
officials declined Tuesday to cite numbers, saying only that thousands
would be affected. They also would not identify the countries involved.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department continues to use all legal authorities to
investigate the terrorist attacks of September 11th and to prevent any
future attacks," officials said in a written statement late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice's highest priority, which is preventing
terrorists from killing more innocent Americans, is reflected throughout
our enforcement operations. Terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda within the
United States are a continuing threat to Americans. We will continue to
focus investigative, intelligence-gathering and enforcement operations on
individuals in the U.S. from countries with highly active Al Qaeda
networks to protect Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Individuals who ignored deportation orders have had little risk of
getting caught until now. In response to that growing embarrassment,
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James W. Ziglar
disclosed last month that his agency was in the process of collecting the
names of deportation fugitives and this year would enter them in the
National Crime Information Center, a database maintained by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new approach, INS officials are counting on local police to
notify them if they come across the fugitives. INS officials would then
deport the "absconders."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials estimate that the new policy might help reduce
the overall total of absconders by 7% to 10% each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We could go after these individuals alphabetically, randomly or use
law enforcement judgment and determine who might be the most dangerous
individuals, based on the fact that some of them are from countries with
active Al Qaeda cells," a Justice Department spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the decision set off new alarms. "We understand there's a
reason for people who break the law to be brought to justice and
apprehended and dealt with appropriately," Hooper said. "But the
enforcement of the law should not be based on religious and ethnic
profiling."</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed concern that, through bureaucratic blunders, innocent
people might be hit with the severe measure of deportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We would expect there will be people on this list who do not know
they've been put in removal proceedings," said Judy Golub, director of
advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. "Everyone has stories
about INS not properly responding to changes of address."</TE>
<TE>   But law enforcement officials, none of whom would comment on the
record, argued that only those who already have flouted deportation
orders would be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Said one Justice Department official: "These are people who have all
had their day in court. They're not just being picked on. They've all had
an opportunity to go before an immigration judge and explain why they
should remain."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Nabs 2 Top Al Qaeda Leaders</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Officials believe phones, laptops could yield
information. Special envoy defends continued airstrikes despite civilian
deaths.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two senior Al Qaeda leaders laden with training documents and
laptops have been caught fleeing heavy bombing in eastern Afghanistan,
U.S. officials said Tuesday, and Washington's new special envoy to
Afghanistan acknowledged that errant airstrikes in the country have cost
"innocent lives."</LD>
<LD>   A team of U.S. soldiers captured 14 suspected Al Qaeda fighters at the
Zhawar Kili al Badr cave and bunker complex near Khowst without a
firefight late Monday, said Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.</LD>
<LD>   The two leaders, who were not identified, were singled out for U.S.
detention and brought to a makeshift prison in the former Taliban
stronghold of Kandahar for interrogation. The 12 others were turned over
to Afghan authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Pentagon officials say they believe that the arrests could yield
valuable information on the Al Qaeda terror network and its targets.
Forensic scientists are searching the computers, mobile phones and
training documents found Monday for information, with a keen eye on the
telephone numbers stored in the phones' memory and messages and documents
stored on the computers, a senior defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   The capture highlighted progress in a bombing campaign that has failed
to yield Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar--and has led some Afghan leaders to urge a halt of airstrikes amid
reports of civilian deaths. As Myers outlined the potential intelligence
gains from Washington, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad used his first
news conference since arriving in Kabul, the Afghan capital, to offer a
vigorous defense of the strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The United States erred in abandoning Afghanistan after rebels
expelled the occupying Soviet army in 1989, Khalilzad said Tuesday, and
Washington is committed to rehabilitating Afghanistan when the war ends.
But continued airstrikes are needed to avert "a return of chaos and Bin
Laden Jr. in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We regret the loss of innocent lives, but we have to weigh the risks
of ending the war prematurely and continuing the operation. And I have no
doubt, on balance, that we will continue the operation until we achieve
our goal," the Afghanistan-born Khalilzad said. "War is not a perfect
business. Mistakes are made."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about errors made by the U.S. military, Khalilzad named only the
Dec. 5 incident in which an errant bomb injured Hamid Karzai, now prime
minister in Afghanistan's interim government, and killed three U.S. Green
Berets.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government will not formally ask the United States to halt
its bombing campaign, Karzai said Tuesday in an interview with the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces are now cleaning up the wreckage of a bombing campaign in
the mountains of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, where Bin Laden
reportedly had taken refuge. But to the south, U.S. bombers have
repeatedly attacked what Myers called a "huge" cave complex in Paktia
province in recent days after intelligence reports found that Al Qaeda
fighters had gathered there.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials contend that the region, where a Green Beret was
killed Friday, remains perilous. As Green Berets on the ground found such
targets as tanks and munitions, an F-14 Tomcat and an F/A-18 Hornet
continued to rain bombs on bunkers and buildings in the Zhawar Kili
complex.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing campaign and the work of 3,500 to 4,000 U.S. troops in
Afghanistan and hundreds more elsewhere in the region continue to produce
some high-profile captures. A senior defense official confirmed that
intelligence reports suggest that recent bombing killed Abu Hafs, also
known as Mahfouz Ould al Walid, and Abu Jafar al Jaziri. Hafs reportedly
was an Al Qaeda operative, and Jaziri was a logistics coordinator for the
terrorist group. Other reports suggested that Abdul Hadi al Iraqi, who
ran some of Bin Laden's training camps, was captured.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Taliban officials also reportedly surrendered, including former
Defense Minister Mullah Obaidulla, former Mines and Industry Minister
Mullah Saadudin Sayed and former Justice Minister Mullah Nooruddin
Turabi.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence and defense officials say intelligence yielded from the
interrogations in Afghanistan by U.S. and allied troops has led to the
arrests of Al Qaeda cell members in Europe and elsewhere and has possibly
thwarted terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the two most-sought-after figures, Bin Laden and Omar, have eluded
capture. Both are probably still in Afghanistan, but Kabul has no
information on where they might be hiding, Afghan Foreign Minister
Abdullah said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some intelligence reports, however, suggest that the two have escaped
to Pakistan. The United States has an agreement that would allow troops
to follow Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives into Pakistan, Army Gen. Tommy
Franks, who is directing the war in Afghanistan, told the Associated
Press. But a senior Pentagon official said U.S. special operations troops
are working only in cooperation with Pakistani soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going in there alone," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The fragile security situation throughout Afghanistan has made it
increasingly likely that Karzai will ask the international community to
provide more troops to patrol cities beyond Kabul if the need arises. In
Kandahar, a wounded Al Qaeda fighter holed up for weeks in a hospital
blew himself up as he tried to escape, hospital guards said. The man was
identified as Abu Bakhar of Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   The number of detainees in U.S. control has risen to 364, with 302 in
Kandahar, 38 at Bagram air base north of Kabul, 16 in the northern city
of Mazar-i-Sharif and eight on the amphibious assault ship Bataan.</TE>

<HD>Chief of NASA Gives Warning of Major Cuts</HD>
<DH>Space: Five days on the job, Sean O'Keefe says no program or center
is immune from cutbacks or closures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The newly appointed chief of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has inherited a financial quagmire at the space agency,
which is facing massive cost overruns that may even prevent it from
sending a full crew to the space station to carry out scientific
research.</LD>
<LD>   With a reputation as a longtime Republican budget cutter and the first
NASA administrator with a predominantly financial background, Sean
O'Keefe has sparked outright fear among the scientists, academics and
space policy analysts. They worry that the Bush administration is using
the cost overruns to make wholesale cuts in the storied agency.</LD>
<LD>   In his first comments to the media just days after taking office,
O'Keefe said Tuesday that no program or center was immune from cuts or
closures, providing the starkest warning yet of another major overhaul of
the troubled agency.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all on the table," said O'Keefe, a former deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget. "I don't have any preset solution of
what the answer ought to be for any dimension of what we do here. It's an
opportunity to think fresh about a variety of things."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks are likely to intensify anxiety among NASA supporters who
fear that cuts could dramatically diminish the nation's preeminent
science and research institution, which had already undergone a decade of
downsizing. The number of NASA employees has been cut by a third, from
about 24,000 to 18,000.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keefe was tapped by President Bush to replace Daniel S. Goldin,
NASA's longtime director who retired after 10 years and three presidents,
leaving a leaner but still troubled agency.</TE>
<TE>   "NASA has been cost-cutting for years now, and the budget has not
grown in the last decade," said Louis Freedman, executive director of the
Planetary Society. "In terms of real dollars, the budget has shrunk, and
the idea that the first priority is to shrink it more is scary."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fears, some analysts and former NASA employees privately
wondered if O'Keefe could in fact clean up the financial mess at the
space agency, long a repository for congressional pork-barrel projects
that have prevented serious restructurings in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has major centers scattered across the nation that were set
up in its 1960s heyday, but the infrastructure is far greater than it
needs to be to carry out its current space and aeronautical research
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of cutting back, as the Pentagon has done, NASA has been
forced to keep the 10 major centers open and staffed. Goddard Space
Center has 3,100 government employees. JPL in Pasadena, a contract
facility, has 5,430.</TE>
<TE>   Closing centers could be his greatest challenge and one that even
Goldin shrewdly avoided broaching with Congress. Instead of shuttering
centers, Goldin slashed staff. At Glenn Research Center in Cleveland,
civilian personnel were slashed from 2,728 in 1993 to 1,850.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, O'Keefe said he has "made no judgment or conclusion at
this time" about closing down a center, although a White House-ordered
review is expected to recommend closing at least one of the 10
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keefe helped shaped the administration's policy toward NASA as
deputy director of OMB, which under one of its reviews recommended
slashing 1,000 civilian jobs from the agency's human spaceflight program.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a bean counter," said Charles Vick, a senior analyst for space
policy at the Federation of American Scientists. "To a large degree, you
do end up with fears whether he is ultimately going to end up being a
butcher of NASA."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said O'Keefe's appointment is the Bush administration's
response to the stunning acknowledgment by NASA early last year that the
construction of the international space station was running nearly $5
billion over budget.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, when the current design for the space station was adopted,
NASA said the station would cost $17.4 billion to construct, or no more
than $2.1 billion a year. But earlier this year, NASA acknowledged that
the construction cost had grown to about $30 billion, or about $5 billion
over the $25-billion spending cap imposed by Congress. The stunning
report apparently angered administration officials who then became
determined to seek out "someone to clean house."</TE>
<TE>   In the morning meeting with the media at NASA headquarters Tuesday,
O'Keefe said the agency needs to focus its attention on reining in the
cost of the space station, including the possibility of scaling back the
program as recommended by an independent panel.</TE>
<TE>   The panel recommended that the agency cut back the number of shuttle
flights to the orbiting post, stick to a three-member crew for the
foreseeable future and reduce the number of modules that would
accommodate a bigger crew to conduct scientific research. The
recommendation has already come under sharp attack from international
partners, such as Japan and Russia, who are eager to send their
astronauts into space.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation, which O'Keefe said he supports, would mean that,
for the next 18 months to two years, the three-member crew would mainly
be flying to the station to maintain it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keefe said he wants to "assure" foreign partners that once "we have
got the baseline program, and the fundamentals of the space station in
place and in operation" that the agency would pursue expansion efforts
based on "mutually agreed science and technology objectives."</TE>
<TE>   "We got time to talk about how it is going to work," O'Keefe said,
adding that he didn't want to assign any particular number to the crews
that would eventually occupy the space station. Current plans call for a
crew of seven.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Education Reform Bill in a Major Bipartisan Achievement</HD>
<DH>Policy: Despite the accord, parties are seen as unlikely to find
similar compromises on other key issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HAMILTON, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday signed into law a sweeping revision of
federal education policy, celebrating the principal bipartisan
achievement of his administration with venerable liberal Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) at his side.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good
people come together to do what's right," Bush said as he signed the bill
at a high school here.</LD>
<LD>   But early signals suggest that apart from the war against terrorism,
opportunities for such bipartisan agreements in 2002 may be scarce.</LD>
<TE>   Bush and Senate Democrats begin the year sharply divided on energy
policy, health care, economic stimulus plans and how to respond to
renewed federal budget deficits--the subject that ignited a recent
firefight of words between the president and Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.). With money tight, and the ideological distance between
Senate Democrats and House Republicans wide, both sides expect more
stalemate than consensus on these domestic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the education bill is probably going to be the
exception" to the rule, said Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff for House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Blending Republican and Democratic priorities, the education measure
requires states to impose new annual reading and math tests for children
in the third through eighth grades, toughens teacher standards and
provides new options to parents whose children attend poorly performing
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Today begins a new era, a new time in public education in our
country," Bush said at the start of a daylong tour that took him from
Ohio to New Hampshire and Massachusetts before he returned to Washington.
"As of this hour, America's schools will be on a new path of reform and a
new path of results."</TE>
<TE>   Education has always been an exception in Bush's relations with
Congress. On most issues--such as the tax cut he pushed through last
spring or the patients' bill of rights legislation that remains
stalled--Bush has designed his proposals mostly to unify Republicans,
even if that meant attracting relatively little support from Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   But on education, the administration engaged in months of negotiations
with an array of Democrats, from liberals such as Kennedy to centrists
such as Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. The result was that
education reform became the only major Bush initiative--apart from the
immediate responses to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--to attract
majority support from legislators in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   That broad support was visible on the platform behind Bush in Ohio on
Tuesday: Kennedy was joined by one of the House's most liberal members,
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), and two conservative Republicans, Sen.
Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio. Bush
praised all of them, including Kennedy, the liberal icon.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks at the Crawford, [Texas,] coffee shop would be somewhat in
shock when I told them I actually like the fellow," Bush said to
laughter. "He is a fabulous United States senator. When he's against you,
it's tough; when he's with you, it is a great experience."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation Bush signed sat in a box nearly 1-foot tall, covered
in blue velvet. With a nod to its heft, Bush said, "I'm not going to read
it all."</TE>
<TE>   The bill largely embodied Bush's campaign pledge to offer flexibility
to school officials for accountability. It gives states and local
districts more freedom in spending federal dollars, but requires the
annual reading and math tests. The bill also reflects Bush's call for
intensified efforts to teach reading in the early grades.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure also advances Democratic desires to substantially
increase spending on Title I, the massive federal program that funds
extra help for low-income students. The amount for Los Angeles Unified
School District will be $309.5 million, $87.2 million more than last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The impulse to compromise on the bill was perhaps most visible in the
way the two sides dealt with schools that fail to improve student
performance on the new exams, a central issue in the legislation.
Originally, Bush proposed that low-income parents in failing schools be
provided federally funded vouchers to help pay for sending their children
to private schools.</TE>
<TE>   But with Democrats and many moderate Republicans opposing such
vouchers, Bush quickly dropped the idea. Instead, lawmakers agreed to
provide funds to states to intervene in failing schools and require them
to offer parents money for after-school tutoring if the schools do not
improve student performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We've spent billions of dollars with lousy results," Bush said
Tuesday. "So, now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good
results."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is reaping a clear political benefit from his focus on education.
A recent poll for a Democratic Party group found him running even with
congressional Democrats when Americans were asked who they trusted most
to improve education. Democrats traditionally have led on that issue, a
top priority for parents, especially women.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big gain" for Bush, said Will Marshall, president of the
Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has paid a price for his compromises: grumbling on the right that
he conceded too much to win Democratic support for the education bill.
Krista Kafer, senior education analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, complained in a recent report that the measure offered only a
"modest representation" of Bush's original ideas and "perpetuates
ineffective and wasteful programs."</TE>
<TE>   One key question for 2002 is how much incentive either Bush or
congressional Democrats have for making other legislative deals that
could irritate their partisan bases. Both sides are expecting a low
turnout in the 2002 elections, which could increase their desire to avoid
alienating the hard-core partisans most likely to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Partly for that reason, some leading conservatives share the
widespread belief among Democrats that the two sides are unlikely to
reach many agreements this year. A return to conventional political
combat seemed evident when Daschle delivered a toughly worded speech
Friday that praised the president's management of the war, but accused
him of squandering the budget surplus. That caused the White House to
fire back with charges that Daschle wanted to raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take Daschle at his word," said Steve Moore, president of
the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee. "He said,
'We think Bush is conducting the war magnificently . . . but we are going
to fight him on the economic and domestic policy front.' So I think it
could be a pretty rancorous year ahead on domestic policy."</TE>
<TE>   Moore predicts that in the year ahead, Bush won't repeat the education
bill model of open-ended talks with Democrats. Instead, he said, on such
key issues as energy and the budget, the administration will try to build
legislative majorities by consolidating Republicans and then picking off
a few moderate to conservative Democrats, especially in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   That was the White House strategy in the stimulus plan, but it failed
when Daschle used procedural steps to block the legislation. Republicans
then denounced Daschle as an obstructionist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you will see more of that, where the White House tries to
fight for the principle, and if they can't win, they will say this is why
we have to get a Republican Senate majority," Moore said.</TE>

<HD>'Baby Boom' for Stars Came Early, New Theory Suggests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pushing the limits of what is possible with today's most powerful
space and ground telescopes, astronomers have come up with a
controversial new analysis of what may have happened during the early
universe--an epoch too old and distant to probe directly even with
today's most powerful technology.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers have long thought of the very early universe as a dark and
quiet place, with only a trickle of new stars beginning to pierce through
the gloom. Many felt that a "baby boom" of star birth did not occur until
the 15 billion-year-old universe was middle-age.</LD>
<LD>   The new theory, by contrast, suggests that when the universe was just
a few hundred million years old, it may have experienced a bright,
violent tempest of new stars being born--a torrent of light reminiscent
of a fireworks finale.</LD>
<TE>   "Quite surprisingly, the finale came first. The fireworks ran
backward. It's not exactly what would have been predicted," said Bruce
Margon, associate director for science at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, which operates the Hubble Space Telescope.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what happened in the hundreds of millions of years after the
Big Bang remains a mystery. The universe has expanded since its creation.</TE>
<TE>   Most astronomers had assumed that answers to the mystery would not
come for at least a decade--until the next generation of space telescopes
are up and able to detect the faint traces of light from the earliest of
stars. Astronomer Ken Lanzetta was unwilling to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Lanzetta, an astronomer at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, based his theory on a new analysis of pictures of a nearly
two-week-long exposure of a patch of seemingly empty sky known as the
Hubble Deep Field. With that long exposure time, Hubble's camera was able
to pick up faint traces of light from galaxies that existed when the
universe was less than 1 billion years old.</TE>
<TE>   "They are faint little blobs of light . . . barely discovered by the
Hubble telescope even with all the stops pulled out," Lanzetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Lanzetta and his colleagues suspected the galaxies were much more
luminous. In the photo, they merely appeared faint because they were so
far away, he hypothesized. His team reanalyzed the images, making use of
how the spectrum of light coming from galaxies is shifted depending on
their distance from Earth-based observers. The new analysis suggests that
the galaxies are indeed much brighter than they appear.</TE>
<TE>   "The light [they give off] is just too faint and has been missed by
all previous measurements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All that light, Lanzetta believes, means that multitudes of stars must
have been created very early on, before the universe was even a billion
years old. "Our results indicate the early universe contained far more
light and far more stars than earlier believed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The results, announced Tuesday at NASA headquarters in Washington,
were just beginning to circulate among astronomers at their annual
meeting. The findings are controversial among astronomers because they
rely on inferences made about light that was not actually seen and
estimated corrections to the amount of light that may be off.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people don't think that so much light is missing from the early
universe," said Richard Ellis, a cosmologist at Caltech who is searching
for the universe's "first light" and is for now sticking to theories that
suggest most stars formed after the universe was at least a billion years
old.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if there is a bit of light missing, it's not going to overthrow
current thinking on the universe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomer who helps run the camera on
Hubble that took the photograph also wanted more proof. "The observation
technique sounds relatively reasonable, but they are making big claims,
so they'll have to be verified," said Karl Stapelfeldt, who works on
Hubble's Wide-Field Planetary Camera, which was built at JPL in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Most astronomers think the findings cannot be absolutely confirmed
until more powerful telescopes capture the light that Lanzetta believes
is out there. Margon, however, praised Lanzetta's analysis. The work
succeeded in "teasing out an incredibly subtle result from what is really
just little fuzz balls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The results are so new that even astronomers sold on the results
Tuesday could not say how they might alter theories on the evolution of
the universe and questions over whether stars were created before
galaxies or vice versa.</TE>

<HD>California Disability Umbrella Is Wider</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday in the case of the Toyota
assembly worker is expected to have little effect in California, where
the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act features a more
worker-friendly definition of disabilities that qualify for on-the-job
accommodations.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not going to close the courthouse doors for employees in
California who have these less-severe impairments," said Rod M. Fliegel,
a partner at Littler Mendelson, the nation's largest employment law firm.</LD>
<LD>   Fred Main, senior vice president of the California Chamber of
Commerce, said the ruling is the latest out of the federal courts that
illustrates the differences between state and federal workplace laws. "As
in many issues of employment law, California's courts are a more
favorable venue than the federal courts for workers," Main said.</LD>
<TE>   California's Fair Employment and Housing Act requires accommodation of
workers whose disabilities merely "limit" the performance of a "life
activity," lawyers said. The Americans with Disabilities Act more
narrowly defines a disability that requires accommodation as an
impairment that "substantially limits" the performance of "major life
activities."</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Senter, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society's Employment
Law Center in San Francisco, said the Supreme Court's latest opinion
further narrows the definition of disability by saying that an impairment
must "severely restrict" performance. " 'Severely' [is] a really high
standard. In California law, it's only a regular 'limitation.' It doesn't
have to be a 'severe limitation.' It doesn't have to be a 'substantial
limitation.' It just has to be a 'limitation.' "</TE>
<TE>   California's law covers most non-federal workers at firms with five or
more employees.</TE>

<HD>Acne Drug Prescribed for Teen Pilot Is Linked to Depression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old student pilot who killed himself by crashing an
airplane into a skyscraper was prescribed an acne medication whose links
to suicide and depression have been the subject of federal inquiries, law
enforcement officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A prescription for Accutane, used to treat severe acne, was found at
the home of Charles J. Bishop, said Pinellas County sheriff's Maj. Sam
Lynn.</LD>
<LD>   "We are aware that he had a prescription," Tampa police spokeswoman
Katie Hughes said. "We don't know if he was taking it, how long . . . we
don't know those details."</LD>
<TE>   Calls to Bishop's family were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration says 147 people taking Accutane,
which affects the body's central nervous system, either committed suicide
or were hospitalized for suicide attempts from 1982 to May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   There has yet to be any conclusive evidence, however, that the drug
causes depression or promotes suicide, and the manufacturer maintains it
is safe.</TE>
<TE>   Toxicology tests that will determine if any drugs were in Bishop's
system will be completed in about two weeks, said Lee Miller, an
associate medical examiner in the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's
Office.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop, a high school freshman, stole an airplane from a flight school
at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport on Saturday and
crashed it into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza in downtown
Tampa. A note expressing sympathy for Osama bin Laden and support for the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was found with him.</TE>
<TE>   Police describe Bishop as a troubled loner. But the youth's family,
teachers and flight instructors said he never showed signs of depression
and his actions Saturday were out of character.</TE>
<TE>   His family and teachers have described him as an intelligent, friendly
young man who was not isolated from others.</TE>

<LD>On Terrorism</LD>
<LD>   THE HORRIFIC EVENTS of September 11th shocked us all--and changed our
world forever. All four hijacked planes were bound for California. And on
that darkest day, more than 100 fellow Californians paid the ultimate
price for our freedom, as much as any soldier who ever fought in any war.
Tonight, we dedicate ourselves to building a future worthy of their
sacrifice. . . .</LD>
<LD>   While we honor and support our fighting men and women overseas, we
also must pay tribute to those keeping us safe here at home. The men and
women of law enforcement and the California National Guard have put
themselves in harm's way to protect our very way of life. For that, we
owe them our deepest gratitude. . . .</LD>
<TE>   My friends, the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard should not have
to pay for the privilege of protecting us against terrorism. As you know,
many of the reserves called to duty left better-paying jobs behind.
During these extraordinary times, I believe the state should pay the
difference between military and civilian pay for those state employees
who were called up to active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Many private companies already make this commitment, and I would urge
every other employer who could to make their Guard employees whole.</TE>
<TE>   Since September 11th, we acted swiftly to protect our airports,
bridges, highways and dams, to secure our water supplies and electricity
grid and to prepare our health facilities. But there is more we can and
must do. First, we're working with the Bush administration to create a
tiered system of public warnings when terrorist threats occur.</TE>
<TE>   Second, we're asking the federal government to allow California
Highway Patrol officers to provide additional sky marshal protection on
in-state flights that they're taking anyway in the course of their
duties.</TE>
<TE>   Third, we'll ensure that law enforcement officials--with the authority
of the court--can monitor communications by suspected terrorists and
allow roving wiretaps on suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, we'll tighten controls over the transportation of toxic and
hazardous materials. In addition, I will ask the attorney general to
review new federal anti-terrorism legislation to ensure that California
law is consistent with--and at least as tough--as national law.</TE>
<TE>On the Economy</TE>
<TE>   THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH also struck a major blow to our nation's
economy. California, like most other states, now faces with daunting
challenges. After three years of unprecedented economic expansion in this
state, the coming year will require difficult choices.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the budgetary cuts that will be necessary, California
will still be much stronger than when I took office three years ago. The
state's underlying economy remains more diverse and entrepreneurial than
ever. When the economy does rebound--as we know it will--California will
be better prepared to come roaring back because of the smart investments
and dramatic progress we have made together over the past three years.</TE>
<TE>On Jobs</TE>
<TE>   ALTHOUGH UNEMPLOYMENT has risen since September 11th, California has
created 900,000 new jobs in the last three years--more than any other
state in America. When I took office in 1999, California was the world's
seventh-largest economy.</TE>
<TE>   Today--because of the extraordinary ingenuity and industry of our
citizens--we are the fifth-largest economy on the planet, having passed
both France and Italy.</TE>
<TE>On Education</TE>
<TE>   IN EDUCATION, we've made consistent and measurable progress: We've
recruited 15,000 new teachers, and 20,000 college students have taken
advantage of our incentives to become future teachers; 100,000 teachers
have received rigorous, world-class training under the auspices of the
University of California. More than 1,300 teachers have met the high
national standards for prestigious national certification--a tenfold
increase in just three years.</TE>
<TE>   Last year alone, in part because of our incentives, 516 California
teachers became Board-certified. More than 200,000 teachers have taken
advantage of our teacher tax credit. And we've put a college education
within the reach of hundreds of thousands of young Californians. For the
first time ever, 100,000 students have earned Governor's Merit
Scholarships, and nearly 200,000 will receive Cal Grants based on merit
and need--the most ever at one time. We take pride in all these numbers,
but here's the one that counts the most: Test scores are up three years
in a row.</TE>
<TE>On Energy</TE>
<TE>   AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, when I stood here last year we were facing an
imminent implosion of our electricity system. The flawed deregulation
scheme we inherited backfired catastrophically. We'd experienced the
first forced blackouts since the Second World War. Experts were
predicting 32 days of blackouts over the summer. We were 100% exposed to
the wildly fluctuating energy market. Merchant generators--and even some
of our own municipal utilities--were gouging us unconscionably. . . .
But, together, we confronted the challenge, and kept power flowing to our
homes, businesses, our cities and farms. . . . We licensed 17 new major
power plants and 12 new peaker plants. Eleven of those plants were put
online and operating by the end of last year, including the first three
major plants in 13 years. In fact, in 2001, we brought more new power
online than in the last 12 years combined, enough to power 2 million
homes.</TE>
<TE>On the Budget</TE>
<TE>   NOW, WITH THE SAME RESOLVE we demonstrated during the energy crisis,
we will squarely confront the current economic downturn and its
consequences. In the coming year, we must have the courage to make tough
decisions in tough times. The Department of Finance and the legislative
analyst agree that we are facing a shortfall of more than $12 billion. We
will have to be smarter and more focused. And we will. I'm confident in
our eventual resurgence and still bright future. But in so doing, we will
not back away from our historic commitments to education, public safety,
health care and economic growth. . . .</TE>
<TE>   The budget I will submit to you in two days will be fair, will
preserve the major gains of the last three years, will protect local
government--and will not increase taxes. I will call upon you to close
the budget gap with a combination of cutbacks, deferred spending,
internal borrowing and accelerated revenue.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Speech Offers a Sunny Look Backward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Facing a stiff reelection fight, Gov. Gray Davis turned his State
of the State address Tuesday into a celebration of himself, seeking
credit he deems overdue and glossing over the huge budget shortfall that
presents his gravest political danger.</LD>
<LD>   From education to health care to--surprisingly--electricity, Davis
offered an unceasingly sunny portrayal of his first three years in
office.</LD>
<LD>   He delivered more than half his 38-minute address before offering
anything beyond a glancing reference to the $12-billion budget gap that
is certain to dominate this election year.</LD>
<TE>   At that, Davis suggested only the barest notion of how he intends to
solve the state's fiscal crisis, promising to boost education funding,
ensure public safety and expand children's programs--all with a carefully
worded pledge not to raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   How he accomplishes this feat will perhaps be explained Thursday, when
he releases his proposed budget for the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night was dedicated mostly to looking backward, in the most
favorable light, not to looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoke and mirrors," Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks
said afterward. "It was a great campaign speech, but it didn't have any
substance to it."</TE>
<TE>   Stolidly delivered, Davis' address was at once the unofficial kickoff
of his reelection campaign, delivered amid the ceremonial trappings of
office, and an attempt to preempt the negative onslaught of his three
Republican rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "When the economy does rebound--as we know it will--California will be
better prepared to come roaring back because of the smart investments and
dramatic progress we've made together over these past three years," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor and his campaign advisors have been frustrated at the way
last year's energy shortfall and terrorist attacks stole attention from
what they consider the accomplishments of Davis' first term.</TE>
<TE>   The State of the State address "is that one occasion during the year
when the governor really has license to brag," said Garry South, the
chief strategist for Davis' reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis used that license, and then some.</TE>
<TE>   Well over half his speech amounted to self-congratulation: He boasted
of cutting taxes, improving the state's relations with Mexico, grooming
an army of new teachers, boosting student test scores, increasing public
safety and expanding conservation, among other achievements.</TE>
<TE>   On energy, widely perceived as one of his greatest vulnerabilities,
Davis touted the construction of new power plants, a crash conservation
program and other emergency steps that "defied the odds and the
prognosticators" who a year ago predicted chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's the only one in the state who believes" he solved the
energy crunch, said Republican gubernatorial hopeful Richard Riordan, who
watched the speech at a hotel across from the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, another of the GOP candidates, seized
on Davis' vaguely worded promise to "not advocate raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   "He never said he would not support new taxes," Jones said, a
sentiment echoed by the third major GOP contender, businessman Bill Simon
Jr., who asserted that higher taxes were "almost a sure bet."</TE>
<TE>   From a political standpoint, Davis' speech Tuesday night positioned
him squarely in the middle. Stylistically, there was no high-flown
rhetoric to match the ornate Assembly chamber. The address was as spare
and lean as the ascetic governor himself</TE>
<TE>   If the response from fellow lawmakers was notably tepid, it is worth
noting that most of his fellow Democrats are well to the left of Davis,
who will run for reelection statewide and not just in the liberal
enclaves of San Francisco, Berkeley and Los Angeles' Westside where many
of the party's legislators thrive.</TE>
<TE>   In an odd political year in which Davis' strongest opposition is
coming from Riordan--a Republican running in some ways to the governor's
left--Davis came up with a hybrid political speech:</TE>
<TE>   From the Republican side, there was a bit of Ronald Reagan's famous
"are you better off now than four years ago?" and echoes of George Bush's
"read my lips, no new taxes." There was even a dash of Democrat Al Gore's
"reinventing government" initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, though, the address was classically Gray Davis: carefully
calibrated, politically acute and cautiously centrist.</TE>
<TE>   The speech was threaded with references to the events of Sept. 11. He
opened by urging lawmakers to "dedicate ourselves to building a future
worthy" of the victims of the terrorist attacks and ended by invoking the
courage of the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93, who "summoned up
the courage to overpower their captors . . . [in] one of freedom's finest
hours."</TE>
<TE>   While claiming credit for all of the good things that occurred over
the last three years, Davis suggested that Sept. 11 was at least partly
responsible for the state's current economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   He is hardly alone in his fiscal vise. At least 40 governors across
the country are facing budget shortfalls in this election year, making it
hard to blame any of them for today's tough economic times--try as their
opponents will.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think there is an awareness that this is a national issue," said
Ray Scheppach, executive director of the bipartisan National Governors
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That said, "If people are willing to give a little bit of a pass in
terms of who created the problem, the question then shifts to: What do we
do now?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis' substantive response will come Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Audit Sees a Lemon in Auto Safety Agency's Oversight</HD>
<DH>Transportation: NHTSA's system of detecting, correcting vehicle
defects is flawed, study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In one case, a child was ejected from a safety seat and killed, but
there is no record that federal automobile defect investigators probed
for a cause that might have led to a recall and saved other lives.</LD>
<LD>   In another case, 153 consumers complained to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration of "burning, smoking and melting" in the
steering columns of two models of vehicles. A recall investigation was
recommended but never started.</LD>
<LD>   In a third example, 23 consumers complained of exhaust leaks in a
particular 1993 model year minivan. The manufacturer had issued bulletins
notifying dealers of the problem. But again, no federal investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Now, a yearlong audit by the Transportation Department's inspector
general, scheduled for release today, has concluded that the
Ford-Firestone safety debacle of 2000 was not an isolated breakdown but a
symptom of a flawed system for detecting and probing auto safety
problems. It found that NHTSA has no consistent procedures for
investigating potentially deadly defects and often relies on incomplete
information to make decisions.</TE>
<TE>Report Warns of Reforms Deferred</TE>
<TE>   The report, requested by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and obtained by
The Times, also warned that several reforms mandated by Congress after
the Firestone recall at NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation are at
risk of not being carried out in a timely fashion.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA's "processes and procedures, as well as the data used for
identifying potential defects and opening investigations, need major
improvements," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   In a formal response, NHTSA agreed to develop new investigative
procedures. But the agency also defended itself, noting that its
investigations account for well over half the vehicles recalled. "We do
believe that very few, if any, significant safety defects have escaped
detection, even given the relatively limited data that has been available
to date," NHTSA officials wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Unconvinced, the inspector general's office said in its written
rebuttal: "We strongly disagree with this statement."</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the controversy is a relatively obscure unit of the
Transportation Department, assigned to monitor the vast automotive
industry. The staff of NHTSA's defects office includes screeners who pore
over consumer complaints looking for patterns and investigators who
pursue potential problems identified by the screeners.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general found:</TE>
<TE>   * NHTSA's database of consumer complaints--its main tool for spotting
safety problems--is inadequate. The agency receives only about 10% of the
volume of consumer complaints that manufacturers get. Many consumers are
not aware that they can complain to the government, and auto makers are
not required to forward their records.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing a random sample of 59 investigations opened in 1998, the
inspector general found that NHTSA received 483 complaints, while auto
makers had received 5,235. In one case, a company received 1,411
complaints of transmission failures that could cause fires, while NHTSA
got only 32. None of the manufacturers was identified in the report.</TE>
<TE>   * Congressionally mandated regulations requiring manufacturers to turn
over records and provide "early warning" of potential safety problems
risk being delayed. Because of the complexity of the legal issues and
auto maker opposition to certain disclosures, a June 30 target date set
by Congress may not be met.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the inspector general recommended that the agency seek
information from other sources as well, such as plaintiffs' lawyers. The
report also warned that a new defect information database NHTSA is
building could be subject to cost overruns and delays.</TE>
<TE>   * NHTSA's criteria for opening an investigation are unclear. While the
Consumer Product Safety Commission has firm rules for investigating
fatalities blamed on the products it regulates, NHTSA does not look into
every death that may be linked to a safety defect.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general found a complaint alleging that an occupant had
been killed in a 1995 luxury vehicle because the air bag did not deploy.
However, there was no record of any follow-up by NHTSA. In other cases,
defect investigators rejected internal recommendations to look into
possible problems but failed to document their reasoning. The inspector
general recommended that the agency study and adopt some of the
procedures of the product safety commission.</TE>
<TE>   * There is no system for reconsidering a decision not to investigate.
In the case of the 1993 minivan model with a record of exhaust leaks, the
inspector general found that a year after it decided not to investigate
23 complaints, NHTSA had received 30 additional cases. "We question why
an investigation was not opened," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, NHTSA has been criticized for responding slowly to
emerging safety issues, such as the Firestone tire failures on Ford
Explorers and the threat that air bags posed to children and small women
in the front seat.</TE>
<TE>Marked Decline in Air Bag Deaths</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA formally initiated the Firestone investigation in May 2000, only
after a Texas television station's reports prompted an increase in
consumer complaints. Previously, it had ignored early warnings from State
Farm Insurance of problems with the tires. NHTSA opened its investigation
with 90 complaints, including 33 accidents and four deaths. But the
inspector general found that Firestone already had 2,288 property damage
claims, 193 personal injury claims and was a defendant in 66 lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Once mobilized, however, NHTSA has been able to address the safety
problems. Air bag deaths have declined markedly, and millions of tires
have been recalled. The inspector general's report cautions that an array
of new powers the agency was granted after the Firestone case will not
automatically benefit consumers unless Congress continues to closely
monitor NHTSA's progress in fulfilling its commitments.</TE>

<HD>Study Details Steep Rise in Depression Therapy</HD>
<DH>Health: Americans being treated soared by 4.6 million over 10
years, researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>The number of Americans treated for depression soared from 1.7
million to 6.3 million from 1987 to 1997, and the proportion of those
receiving antidepressants doubled, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers attributed the sharp increases to the emergence of
aggressively marketed new drugs like Prozac, the rise in managed care and
an easing of the stigma attached to the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The study found that the share of patients who used antidepressant
medication climbed from 37% to nearly 75%. At the same time, the
proportion who received psychotherapy declined from 71% to 60%.</LD>
<TE>   While an increase in treatment for depression was not surprising, "the
size of the increase was larger than I think most people in the field
expected," said Dr. Mark Olfson, a psychiatrist at Columbia University
and the New York State Psychiatric Institute who led the study. Studies
since 1997 suggest the trend continues, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The increase in the treatment of depression cuts broadly across the
population and extends to Hispanics and African Americans, people who are
unemployed and uninsured," Olfson said. "These changes reflect broader
changes in attitudes toward the treatment of depression and a decrease in
stigma."</TE>
<TE>   The study was an analysis of two national surveys. The findings appear
in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The publicizing of newer antidepressants that have fewer side
effects--such as Prozac, which was introduced in late 1987--has helped
make patients more willing to seek treatment, the researchers said. This
publicity has included pharmaceutical industry efforts to market the
drugs directly to consumers and public-awareness campaigns about
depression.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in managed care also has contributed to the increase in use
of medication, which may be less costly and time-consuming than
psychotherapy, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Managed care also has placed more emphasis on primary care physicians,
who may be more likely to prescribe medication than to refer patients to
specialists for psychotherapy, said Ronald Kessler, a professor of health
care policy at Harvard University who was not involved in the study.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler said evidence shows that combining medication with
psychotherapy is the most effective treatment for depression. While many
of the patients studied received both, some clearly did not, and Kessler
said the findings do not indicate whether patients received adequate
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't know about is the quality of the care people are
getting, but there are reasons to suggest there are problems with
quality," said Harold Pincus, vice chairman for psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh and one of the study's authors.</TE>
<TE>   Substantial numbers of patients receive a single prescription for
medicines and don't refill it, he said. Since the drugs often take a
month to have an effect, one prescription is unlikely to do very much.
But overburdened primary care doctors have no incentive to do the kind of
long-term follow-up that chronic conditions like depression demand, which
means that many patients may not be getting the best treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis is based on data from 34,459 people who participated in a
1987 medical expenditures survey by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. The researchers compared those findings with data from
32,636 participants in a similar 1997 survey by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality.</TE>
<TE>   While the study shows "that the acceptance of a medical intervention
for depression is clearly increasing, it still is significantly below
what the potential need for care is," said Dr. Darrel Regier, research
director for the American Psychiatric Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Other surveys have suggested that about 5% of the U.S.
population--roughly 14 million people--could benefit from treatment for
depression, but the study suggests that only about half that number are
actually receiving care, he said.</TE>

left at room temperature to be baked at the last minute. Or you can make
it even more in advance, freeze it, then pop it straight into the oven.
The baking time in that case will increase to 20 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon flour</TE>
<TE>   10 egg yolks</TE>

<TE>   Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set over,
but not touching, simmering water. Stir in the flour and remove from the
heat to cool slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer and slowly add the
sugar until the whisk leaves a thick ribbon that stays on top of the
batter when it is lifted out, about 5 minutes. Pour the chocolate into
the yolk-sugar mixture and gently fold them together.</TE>
<TE>   Spray 10 (1/2-cup) ramekins with cooking spray. Half-fill each with
chocolate batter, place 1 ganache ball in the center and then continue
filling to the top with more batter. Place the ramekins on a rimmed
baking sheet. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point up to 1 hour in
advance and stored at room temperature, or 1 week in advance and frozen,
tightly covered.)</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cakes until they begin to pull away from the sides of the
ramekins, 13 to 15 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.</TE>

<LD>Hemmings obituary--The obituary for Peter Hemmings on Friday
incorrectly identified the composer of "Kullervo" as Joonas Kokkonen; the
opera was written by Aulis Sallinen. It also incorrectly reported that
Music Center Opera produced "The Fiery Angel" in America for the first
time; in fact, Prokofiev's opera was performed earlier in New York and
Chicago.</LD>

<LD>Emergency rooms--In a Section A article Dec. 29 about difficulties
in getting physician specialists to respond to hospital emergency rooms,
an ER physician at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas was misquoted.
The doctor, Michele Grad, was quoted as saying that a hand surgeon on
call refused to come in to operate on a man who had nearly severed three
fingers and, as a result of the delays, two of the fingers had to be
amputated. Grad actually said that the hand surgeon came in and tried to
refer the patient to another hospital and that delays may have resulted
in amputations. The hospital says its records show that the injury
involved only a finger and a thumb and that only part of the finger had
to be amputated. The hospital contends that delays were not extreme and
played no role in the outcome.</LD>
