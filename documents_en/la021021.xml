<HD>Sizing up a new oil: avocado</HD>
<DH>It offers monounsaturated fat and nutrients, but fat is
fat, say nutritionists. And it's not cheap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a fat-obsessed nation, we've come to scrutinize every drop of oil
we consume, ready to try whatever promises to be the most healthful
-- and avocado oil could be next on our list.</LD>
<LD>   High in natural chemicals that lower cholesterol and fight
disease, avocado oil is increasingly touted -- at least by growers
and processors -- as even more healthful than current favorites olive
and canola.</LD>
<LD>   Most health claims about the oil are drawn from studies about the
fruit itself (yes, avocado is a fruit), rich in a plant compound
called beta-sitosterol, which helps block absorption of cholesterol
in the intestines. Like the fruit, the oil also has antioxidants such
as vitamin E, believed to reduce coronary artery disease and help the
skin; lutein, a carotenoid that protects the eyes against diseases
like cataracts and macular degeneration and that may guard against
prostate cancer; and glutathione, which regulates other antioxidants,
such as vitamins C and E.</LD>
<TE>   But while acknowledging the benefits of oils, like avocado, that
are high in monounsaturated fats, nutritionists question whether
these other nutritional components will make much difference in your
daily diet.</TE>
<TE>   "The beta-sitosterol does help block cholesterol absorption, but
there are better forms of it, for instance, Benecol margarine, which
can actually claim that," said Dr. Sheldon Margen, a professor of
public health at UC Berkeley. That's because Benecol contains a
converted version of beta-sitosterol, called a stanol, that's better
at blocking cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about oil is, you're not supposed to use very much of
it. I don't care how many nutrients it has in it," said Dale Ogar,
managing editor of the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the type of fat it contains, she said, "it's still 9
calories per gram, just like any other fat."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the buzz about avocado oil, pressed from the green flesh
of the fruit, is coming from New Zealand, where manufacturers are now
producing not only the oil, but also avocado oil spreads and avocado
oil capsules as a source of vitamin E.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where 90% of U.S. avocados are grown, some gourmet
companies are selling the oil at specialty food and health stores,
alongside such heart-healthful oils as olive, canola, safflower and
sunflower, all rich in the good fats known to lower bad cholesterol.
Avocado oil, like olive oil, canola oil and peanut oil, is high in
desirable monounsaturated fats, while safflower, sunflower, corn,
flaxseed and canola oils are rich in polyunsaturated fats, which also
lower bad cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   Fats occur in several forms. Saturated fats, like those found in
butter and red meat, were considered the least healthful for the
heart and blood vessels until health officials began focusing on
trans fats found in solid shortenings and partly hydrogenated
vegetable oils. Nutritionists advise sticking with monounsaturated
oils, which can lower bad cholesterol, and polyunsaturated oils,
which not only lower cholesterol, but also provide some of the
important fatty acids, like linoleic acid and alpha-linoleic acid,
that the body needs to function.</TE>
<TE>   Avocado oil, however, can be an expensive choice in a field
crowded with alternatives to solid shortenings and saturated fats.</TE>
<TE>   "Most consumers who walk into an oil section [of a supermarket]
get overwhelmed when they walk past sunflower, safflower and canola,"
said Leslie Brenner Newman, spokeswoman for Spectrum Organic Products
Inc. in Petaluma, which sells a refined avocado oil for cooking, skin
care and massage. "Unless there is an informed employee who can
explain how this oil would work, they will go to the olive and
canola, the standbys."</TE>
<TE>   Avocado oil is available in the so-called "virgin" varieties,
which have a greenish color and stronger taste, and refined versions,
which have a more golden hue and milder taste. Because it has a high
smoking point, meaning it won't burn or smoke until it's heated to
nearly 500 degrees -- compared with 374 for olive oil -- the oil is
suitable for searing meat and stir-frying meats, fish and vegetables.
However, high heat breaks down many of the antioxidants that make it
attractive, so some manufacturers emphasize its appeal in salad
dressings and for dipping bread, much like the olive oil found so
often on restaurant tables instead of butter.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition
and an advisor to the California Avocado Commission, said that from
the consumer's standpoint, "it's still the same oil as olive oil,
largely monounsaturated. Theoretically, it's healthy and some studies
show a modest lowering of cholesterol, comparable to if you're using
olive oil."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "there are no magic fats. Remember: 120 calories a
tablespoon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>At nearly six months pregnant, my waist was thickening fast and my
fitness options were narrowing even faster. My doctor recommended
exercise but advised low-impact workouts such as hiking, swimming and
yoga. I craved variety and needed an energy boost, so I signed up for
a class in tai chi chuan, the ancient Chinese system of calisthenics
and self-defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese say that whoever practices tai chi regularly will gain
the pliability of a child, the vitality of a lumberjack and the peace
of mind of a sage. Benefits are said to range from improved posture,
circulation, metabolism and digestion to accelerated healing of
disease and infection. I definitely needed most of those.</LD>
<LD>   Like most Chinese martial arts, tai chi is taught through a
private oral tradition, from master to disciple. Talent, diligence
and correct instruction all are essential ingredients for advancement
in tai chi. Picking a good teacher is the most important of the
three. I contacted hospitals, YMCAs and community colleges that offer
tai chi, but I found my master at the West Side Academy of Dance in
Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   Terence Pang-Yen Dunn is the senior student of a real tai chi
master, with 30 years of training. Dunn, 48, has taught tai chi to
ballerinas and was brought in by Laker Coach Phil Jackson to teach
tai chi to Kobe, Shaq and the rest of the team during the 2000-01
season. He has also worked with heart patients at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles, using tai chi to help relieve pain and
speed recovery after surgery. His instructional videos on tai chi
have sold more than 1 million copies. I showed up at Studio 7 at the
West Side Academy of Dance on a recent Tuesday night dressed in loose
sweats and with bare feet. There were six others in my class. The
class was mixed-level; the most experienced student had practiced tai
chi for a decade, the least experienced student for seven months. My
husband and I were complete novices.</TE>
<TE>   The class began with warmups. For the next two hours, I would
follow Dunn with my eyes and echo his graceful balletic movements
with my limbs. A handsome, lanky man with lively eyes, I could
imagine him launching himself through the window of the ballet studio
and effortlessly taking down opponents, like a hero in a Hong Kong
martial arts film.</TE>
<TE>   We moved slowly as Asian-sounding music played in the background,
and for the duration of the class the ballet studio was transformed
into a Chinese temple. "Tai chi movement is circular and continuous,"
Dunn said as we swayed gently, flowing back and forth, our wrists
swinging limply, our weight transferring from one leg to the other.</TE>
<TE>   These warm-up exercises focused on opening up our hips and
shoulders. As we moved, Dunn explained some of the cardinal
principles of tai chi that any beginner must master. He reminded us
to balance our weight fully onto each leg, alternating the movement
of yang with the stillness of yin. He told us to turn at the waist to
control all of our movement. He exhorted us to keep our spines
straight and erect. And he kept an eye on our hands swinging back and
forth, helping us to release tension in our arms so we had "beautiful
lady's wrists." These loose wrists, he explained, would expand
suppleness to our joints so that eventually the movement of our
entire body would flow like "a string of pearls."</TE>
<TE>   After warmups we lined up at one end of the room and began a
slow-motion walk across the floor. At the end of each step we twirled
our feet first to the right, then left, moving so slowly it was
surreal to watch and to do. Complete relaxation, Dunn told us, is
another principle that a beginner must master.</TE>
<TE>   "The masters walk so slowly it looks like they are not even
moving," Dunn said. "The last one to the end is the winner. The
psychic field you generate through moving slowly is magnetic."</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult to move at this reduced speed. But it also felt
so soothing to slow down. I thought of my high-speed L.A. life.
Always, I am running, rushing, thinking of what I must do next. Here
I focused my attention inward, concentrating all my energy on going
"slower than a sand dune."</TE>
<TE>   Next we began to do some of the actual tai chi forms. Dunn
explained the history and benefits as we moved.</TE>
<TE>   The names of our postures sounded poetic and exotic: "monk looking
at the moon," "white crane spreads wings," "playing the guitar,"
"picking up needle on sea bottom" and "silk weaver." They also
offered clues as to what the forms were supposed to look like.</TE>
<TE>   We held these simple postures, often resting back on one leg so
long I began to tremble.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said more experienced practitioners will hold a pose for five
minutes. A master might hold a single pose for 40 minutes. Dunn moved
through the room fixing our alignment -- the way our feet were
planted, the direction our hips faced, the angle of our arms. These
positions, he said, are the foundations, or roots.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the positions -- holding our arms in front of us as if
encircling a beach ball or pushing our own hands off our wrists as if
escaping an attacker -- are codified techniques designed to train a
body to resist assault.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn explained that tai chi hides martial arts techniques in
innocuous exercises that give you the ability to really hurt someone
if you have to. Tai chi, one of three "internal" schools of Chinese
martial arts, emphasizes complete relaxation to induce natural
movement.</TE>
<TE>   So-called "external" schools of martial arts, such as most of the
kung-fu-style fighting portrayed in TV series and Jackie Chan movies,
start out using more muscular strength.</TE>
<TE>   From one posture to the next, we moved slowly, like constellations
or waves or ripples on a lake. It looked effortless, but I felt a
sheen of sweat all over my body. Sometimes I became hypnotized by my
own movements, as I followed my hands with my eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn called these "moving meditations."</TE>
<TE>   "Tai chi demands absolute mindfulness," Dunn said. "This is not
some New Age space-out dance."</TE>
<TE>   One of my classmates, Tracey Wagner, 40, said she took up tai chi
earlier this year because it gives her an incredible workout without
battering her body. She said regular practice has given her increased
flexibility, stronger legs and better posture. "It's like an art
form," she said. "It's a chance to feel grace of movement, fluidity
of the body. Yoga is more vigorous in a way. Tai chi is kind of like
letting it all fall away."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the class we did some meditations. We did "natal"
breathing, designed to return us to the way we breathed as newborns.
Class ended not with euphoria but with calm. I felt intensely alive,
not tired at all.</TE>
<TE>   The students quietly left. I felt a deep peace I had not felt in
this crazed city I've loved for as long as I can remember. I slept
deeply that night, lost in slo-mo dreams.</TE>

<HD>Experimental drug targets environment of cancer cells</HD>
<DH>Velcade appears to prolong the lives of patients with
late-stage multiple myeloma. If studies continue to go well, it could
be on the market soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most doctors used to think that the way to cure cancer was to attack
it with every conceivable weapon. Now some are trying, instead, to
disrupt the disease's environment.</LD>
<LD>   In a clinical trial completed earlier this year, a drug based on
this approach helped prolong the lives of a majority of people with
late-stage multiple myeloma, a deadly cancer that destroys bone
tissue.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, Velcade, is known as a proteasome inhibitor. It stops
enzymes called proteasomes from clearing cells of protein debris.
Scientists hope that by preventing the proteasomes from doing their
job, the cancer cells will become so dysfunctional, they'll shut down
and die.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first proteasome inhibitor to make it to the clinic,"
said Dr. Ken Anderson, a Harvard professor and lead investigator in a
new Velcade study. "What's exciting about it is it can induce the
death of cells that are resistant to conventional therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Velcade, which is made by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., is thought to work by interrupting the attachment
of myeloma to bone marrow and by stopping the production of factors
that the myeloma cell needs to grow and spread.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional cancer treatment focuses on the cancer cells and,
though it often works, the chemotherapy can weaken healthy cells.
This can cause side effects from vomiting and weight loss to anemia
and bone marrow suppression. Sometimes, cancer cells become resistant
to the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to targeting the tumor cell, [Velcade] focuses on the
host-tumor interaction and the environment where the tumor cell
lives," Anderson said. "Focusing on these two aspects will open up a
vast new field of therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Proteasome inhibitor therapies should not cause the same kind of
systemwide havoc that chemotherapy causes. Interrupting a normal cell
process, however, can cause side effects. In the earlier clinical
trials, some patients experienced a drop in platelets, cells needed
for blood clotting, and occasional neuropathy, which is nerve damage
causing pain and numbness. But many of those patients had experienced
the problems before taking Velcade, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, for reasons that are still unexplained, cancer cells
seem much more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than normal cells
are, Anderson says.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration views Velcade promising enough to
grant it fast-track status, which means it could be moved to the
marketplace faster than usual if ongoing studies show it benefits
patients with few remaining treatment options. Researchers also are
studying Velcade's effect on solid tumors, such as breast, lung and
prostate cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting multiple myeloma</TE>
<TE>   Multiple myeloma is bone-marrow cancer. Each year, about 15,000
Americans are diagnosed with it and about 11,200 die. Only 14% of
people with the disease survive longer than five years.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 78 people taking the experimental drug Velcade:</TE>
<TE>   20% had a greater than 90% reduction in a marker that indicates
the amount of cancer present.</TE>
<TE>   27% had a disease reduction of between 25% and 90%.</TE>
<TE>   77% experienced tumor reduction or a stabilization of their
disease.</TE>
<TE>   A larger study of Velcade is underway at 66 sites. The study will
compare the progress of 300 patients on Velcade with 300 patients on
dexamethasone, a standard therapy. Results of that study are expected
in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Defibrillators turn bystanders into rescuers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lifesaving potential of defibrillators, the devices that shock a
wildly irregular heartbeat back into its normal rhythm, has never
been questioned. But no one knew whether putting them in the hands of
untrained bystanders would actually save lives. A new study shows it
does.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in 1999, Chicago began installing automated
defibrillators throughout airports, putting them in highly visible,
accessible glass cabinets within a minute or so walk from each other
-- almost like fire extinguishers. Television monitors and printed
handouts described how the devices should be used.</LD>
<LD>   In two years, 21 people went into cardiac arrest in two of the
three airports, and 18 of them had the kind of heart rhythm problem
that could be corrected with a defibrillator. Eleven of the men and
women were resuscitated. In six of those situations, the rescuers had
no training in using automated defibrillators.</LD>
<TE>   A separate study recently concluded that, because most cardiac
arrests occur at home, wide distribution of the devices wouldn't
significantly reduce fatalities. But, Dr. Lance B. Becker of the
emergency resuscitation center at the University of Chicago
Hospitals, says, "This study is amazing because untrained people were
the rescuers. Twenty years ago, the only person who could
defibrillate was a physician. Now ... the average citizen has the
possibility of saving a person's life."</TE>

<TE>   The cough reflex in women may be more sensitive than it is in men</TE>
<TE>   Women are twice as sensitive to irritants in their environment as
men are, British researchers have found, which may explain why women
more often are troubled with chronic coughs.</TE>
<TE>   In a test of more than 100 people with the condition, women
reacted sooner to one-second inhalations of red pepper extract or
citric acid, coughing at lower concentrations of the irritants than
men did. Whether a person smoked or had asthma didn't appear to
affect sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts had assumed that women are more troubled with
coughing because their airways were smaller, but this study suggests
sex hormones may affect the response of inflammatory cells in chronic
coughers, the researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Boys and girls are thought to have similar cough reflexes ...
[but] our study confirms there is a fundamental difference between
men and women. Perhaps the difference has something to do with the
hormonal changes that occur in puberty," says Dr. Alyn Morice of the
University of Hull in Cottingham, England.</TE>

<TE>   Teething still gets mistakenly blamed for other ills</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, experts confirmed that the fever, diarrhea and
rashes often linked to teething aren't caused by the eruption of
teeth through the gums. But even medical pros seem hesitant to give
up the notion that these and other symptoms are par for the teething
course. A survey of nurses, pharmacists, dentists, general
practitioners and pediatricians in Australia found that most believe
young children suffer a wide range of symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The number of symptoms blamed on teething varied with the
professional group. Pediatricians were least likely to believe there
was a link (on average attributing 2.8 symptoms to teething); nurses
were the most likely (9.8 symptoms). All groups often recommended
acetaminophen and teething gels, and more than half of the
pharmacists suggested sedating medication.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the parents who need relief. Many of the health
professionals surveyed believed that parents had as much if not more
distress than the infants. "The main reason for challenging these
beliefs is to allow parents and health professions to take more
appropriate action ... and avoid unnecessary medication," says
pediatrician Melissa Wake of the Royal Children's Hospital in
Victoria, Australia.</TE>

<DH>More men are turning to cosmetic surgery to give their
bodies and self-image a boost. Now, chest implants are rising in
popularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank (not his real name) is talking from New York City (not his real
home) about his chest (not his real muscles).</LD>
<LD>   When Frank was a kid, he felt skinny, that his chest wasn't big
enough. Even after four years of swimming for his university, it
wasn't big enough. Even after lifting weights for the past 20 years,
it still wasn't big enough.</LD>
<LD>   "I got compliments on my arms, legs, back, everything but the
chest," said the 5-foot-9, 180-pound investment broker. That changed
about nine months ago, however, when the 49-year-old Hollywood
resident decided to get pectoral implants. It turns out the pair of
palm-sized, solid silicone discs were enough.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm like a peacock strutting his feathers," said Frank, who
wanted to remain anonymous because friends don't know he had the
procedure. "I feel more positive about myself than ever and I'm not
self-conscious anymore about wearing an open shirt. I've got nice
cuts. I like the way I look."</TE>
<TE>   As American men confront a barrage of images of pumped-up male
perfection, plastic surgeons across the country say that a growing
number are willing to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000 to put in
what God, genetics or exercise left out of their chests. Precise
statistics on the number of pectoral implants, or "male chest
enhancements," performed in the United States are unavailable because
the trend is still young. Many plastic surgeons expect pectoral
implants to continue to rise in popularity for a variety of reasons.
The procedure's best sales pitch is transmitted across the cultural
landscape where chiseled masculine chests are displayed on everything
from fitness magazines to underwear ads to Hollywood action heroes.</TE>
<TE>   And the bulking up has not been limited to mere fantasy. Today's
professional athletes, especially in major sports such as football
and baseball, are bigger, stronger and more muscular than a
generation ago. Michelangelo's David has been crushed and replaced by
the Rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Give it five years, you're going to see a lot more pec implants,"
said Roberto Olivardia, a Harvard psychiatrist who co-wrote "The
Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession," which
concluded that a growing number of men feel shamefully ugly because
they consider themselves to be too fat or too underdeveloped
muscularly. "Men are being targeted by the media and advertising with
the kind of images that women have been bombarded with for years. And
like women, it's making men dissatisfied with their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Another possible reason for the growth in pec implants and other
cosmetic procedures in men is that baby boomers tend to place a high
premium on a youthful, fit-looking appearance and seem to have more
trouble adjusting to the aging process than previous generations, say
plastic surgeons. Not only do workers feel the need to dress for
success, but increasingly their bodies must reflect that credo too.
Another factor is that most cosmetic surgery is relatively
uncomplicated and can be performed in outpatient clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, nearly 1 million American men elected to have cosmetic
surgery, a figure that represents almost 15% of the overall plastic
surgery market, according to the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons. Twenty years ago, today's top five surgical procedures for
men -- nose reshaping, liposuction, eyelid surgery, hair transplants
and breast reduction -- were virtually unheard of men.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking 'a quick fix'</TE>
<TE>   "Men want to achieve that magazine look [in the chest], and if
they can't do it through discipline, they'll try it through other
means," said Dr. Josh Korman, a plastic surgeon in Mountain View,
Calif., and a clinical faculty member at Stanford University Medical
School. "People want a quick fix."</TE>
<TE>   The original demand for pec implants came from bodybuilders in the
early 1980s. By that time, the 1977 documentary "Pumping Iron,"
featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, helped to fuel a nationwide surge in
the sport. Despite their exhaustive hours in the gym, some
bodybuilders soon discovered genetics were imposing limits on their
muscle size.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it's not just bodybuilders who want a larger chest. Models,
personal trainers and actors are among the most likely professionals
to seek the procedure, say plastic surgeons. But even men whose
livelihood doesn't depend on working shirtless -- car mechanics or
attorneys, for example -- have gone under the knife to expand their
chest size. While the surgery has been performed all over the
country, the majority of procedures are done in Southern California
and Florida, according to plastic surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   "The general population is interested in implants now. They don't
want to look like a bodybuilder," said Dr. Adrien Aiache, a Beverly
Hills plastic surgeon who has designed his own line of pectoral
implants. "They want to look more macho."</TE>
<TE>   The opaque-colored implants are made of pliable but solid silicone
-- a different composition from breast implants for women, which are
typically filled with saline. As one plastic surgeon put it, if a
female breast implant is a 2 on a hardness scale of 1 to 10, the male
implant is about a 5.</TE>
<TE>   The implants, which come in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit
the contours of the male chest, are tucked under the pectoral muscles
by one of two surgical methods. First, in the endoscopic method, a
long, thin tube cuts through the crease of the armpit to the chest.
Through this mini-canal, the camera-equipped endoscope places the
implant into the chest. Or, in the traditional method, small
incisions can be made just under the armpit -- almost never through
the nipple, which leaves considerable scarring -- and the implant is
inserted. The procedure typically takes less than two hours and is
usually performed in the doctor's office under general anesthesia.
Patients often can go home about two hours after surgery and are
instructed to remain in bed for 24 hours. Normal activities can be
resumed within a week and patients are advised to wait at least six
weeks before returning to vigorous physical activities.</TE>
<TE>   Risk of complications</TE>
<TE>   Implant surgery comes with roughly the same risk of complications
for men as it does for women, according to plastic surgeons.
Excessive bleeding or fluid buildup around the implant can occur in
1% to 2% of cases. Infections can also occur in 1% of cases, and may
require the removal of the implants.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there's a slight risk of displacement. For various reasons,
the implant may shift, which could require another surgery to
correct.</TE>
<TE>   "The implant can move and flip," said Korman. "Gravity is still
gravity."</TE>
<TE>   After a full recovery, of course, the question becomes: Do they
look real or fake? If the job is done properly, it's very difficult
to tell, even for a plastic surgeon, doctors said. The only reliable
indicator would be scars, and those are near the wrinkle of the
armpit and difficult to detect, they said.</TE>
<TE>   However, once a man has had implants, they are usually in for a
lifetime, unless he chooses to remove them. That means a man must
maintain his musculature to conform to the implant. Otherwise, the
chest and arms or back will look out of proportion.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be overdone," said Dr. Francis Palmer, a Beverly Hills
plastic surgeon. "If you have a nice, well-defined chest and you're
totally slovenly everywhere else, then that might be a hint you've
had some help."</TE>
<TE>   More than any physical or cosmetic risks, however, the surgery in
some cases can indicate a poor self-image that the procedure is
unlikely to heal -- no matter how good the patient's pecs may look
afterward, said Olivardia. "I don't think cosmetic surgery is a bad
thing.... " he said. "But I get concerned when people place too great
a stake in what pec implants will do for them, when they think this
surgery will make them whole. That's when it's problematic."</TE>
<TE>   The point is buttressed by the apparent embarrassment men feel
regarding their surgeries. Several plastic surgeons who were asked to
contact patients for this story reported that most patients were
highly reluctant to disclose their experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt there's a strong social stigma for men," said
Dr. Gregory Mueller, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who says he has
performed about 250 pec implants in the past four years. "They are
very guarded about talking about it. Women are much more open about
their surgeries."</TE>
<TE>   But just how popular pec implants may become is open to debate.
While bodybuilders may be frustrated they can't develop individual
pecs the size of a phone book, the average male with more modest
ambitions has a viable option to surgery -- pumping iron at the local
health club.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell [potential implant clients] they should start in the gym,"
said Korman. "A woman cannot make her breasts any bigger. But a man
can make his chest bigger by exercise. You just have to do it."</TE>

<HD>A doctor who's sick with worry</HD>

<AU>Samuel Shem</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One problem with being a doctor is that when you are the patient you
worry like crazy. For every little symptom, you use all of your
medical training to make the diagnosis, and you inevitably conclude
that the symptom is of the worst possible event; that is, you are
about to die. You have informed worry. This sense of impending doom
can be augmented by a bad doctor and dissipated by a good one. With a
good doctor's attention to worry, healing can occur. Let me give an
example from my recent total hip replacement surgery.</LD>
<LD>   A pain in my knee while running led to an X-ray of my knee
(normal) and then of my hip. This revealed a joint which, in the
words of "Dr. Hip" at a great Boston hospital: "If you told me you
wanted it done today, I would do it today." He then added that they
were developing a new polymer that would make the joint last longer,
so I should delay the operation as long as I could stand it. How
would I know when I was ready? "It's the Necktie Sign," the kindly
old man said, smiling. "It's when you come in here and reach across
my desk and grab my necktie and scream, 'Now! Do me now!' "</LD>
<TE>   Four years later I went to grab his necktie, but he had retired.
He referred me to his protege, whom I will call "Dr. B." Like many
orthopedic surgeons, he looked like a day laborer -- a big guy with
big shoulders and hearty hands and not much neck. He had a broad face
that broke into a smile a lot, a boyish head of hair and an appealing
shyness, as if he were sorry to have to do surgery on me. My wife
liked him. Done deal.</TE>
<TE>   Things mostly went well. Just before surgery, the anesthesia
doctor came in and said I had a choice of general anesthesia or a
spinal. "General" puts you totally out, so a machine breathes for
you; "spinal" is the administration, into your spinal cord, of drugs
that anesthetize and paralyze you from above the operative site down
to your toes. You can be conscious during a spinal, although
routinely you are given drugs that leave you sleepy or asleep, but
there is no "hangover."</TE>
<TE>   Four days of worrying</TE>
<TE>   I asked the anesthesia doctor what she would do, and she said a
spinal, no question. Dr. B. came along, in a charming lime-green
shower cap that made him look like a woman shot-putter on her way to
the showers, and said the same thing, so I went along. Somewhat doped
up, I fell asleep. I woke up only once to hear a loud noise nearby --
my surgeon hammering happily on my hip. But I didn't feel anything
and talked to him for a while and then went back to sleep. I woke up
totally dead from the chest down -- unable to feel anything or move
anything. My first worry was that they had severed my spinal cord and
no life would ever come into my lower body again. This was the first
of many worries during my four days in the hospital, witness:</TE>
<TE>   When I turned out to be exquisitely sensitive to narcotics and my
blood pressure plummeted to that of an amoeba (60 over 50) and I was
about to pass out, I worried that the narcotics plus the beta blocker
they had given me for the surgery had eradicated my normal heart
action and I was going to die.</TE>
<TE>   When I sat up and had the most severe headache of my life, I
worried that it was a ruptured cerebral aneurysm and that I was about
to die.</TE>
<TE>   When I suddenly had a shaking chill -- a rigor -- in which all my
muscles clenched like steel traps all at once (including the
un-narcotized muscles around my hip replacement that sent a blast
furnace of pain through my body), I diagnosed a septicemia from which
no one recovers. I knew I would die before sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   Through all these worries, the nurses helped and Dr. B. was always
available. His words were always reassuring, his face sometimes not.</TE>
<TE>   But I made it through and went home and, suddenly alone in my bed
and unable to move much, the real worry began. All day and for great
snatches of the night I had many different symptoms, each igniting a
fuse of worry that I just knew would end in the implosion of death.</TE>
<TE>   It was three weeks post-op. I lay in bed worrying about the pain
in my calf, which I had concluded was a DVT, or deep vein thrombosis
-- a blood clot that, in a whimsical break for freedom, would
dislodge at any moment, travel up into my lungs and result in
pulmonary embolus, leaving me dead as a doornail. For the first two
weeks I had been on Coumadin, an anticoagulant used to prevent DVTs.
Now I was off Coumadin, and I pictured my red cells and platelets
clogging like a crowd at a South American soccer game trying to exit
all at once -- with many deaths. I worried and worried and thought to
call Dr. B. I had called him a couple of times before with minor
stuff, but now I didn't feel I should bother him. After all, I'd had
this calf pain for a while. Why wasn't I dead yet?</TE>
<TE>   I lived with my DVT worry for a day or two. Then, one sunny summer
morning as I was crutching around the garden and throwing the ball to
the dog, I noticed them: There, just below the knee, were
varicosities! Varicose veins! I checked the normal leg. No veins. I
tried to recall if I'd ever seen them before. No. My diagnosis?
Because of the DVT further down in my calf, the blood couldn't flow
through the normal deep-vein route to get back to the heart, so it
was trying the superficial veins, and because they aren't made for
the load, they pop out in these purplish little pods.</TE>
<TE>   'The root of fear is time'</TE>
<TE>   The dog stood there, open-mouthed, waiting for the next throw.
Little did he know that if I made any kind of sudden movement I would
drop, and the ball game, so to speak, would be over. Gingerly, I
crutched back to the kitchen, wondering if it would be better to sit,
stand or lie down -- my informed worry had no answer. I started to
sweat and then I felt a chill of fear. Should I call for help? Call
Dr. B.? Call 911? Call my wife? Check my will?</TE>
<TE>   I did nothing, except worry. I once heard a great person say, "The
root of fear is time," and now, finally, it made sense. I was in no
pain now, but I was frantic about what was about to happen. In an
hour my wife came home. I decided not to worry her. She immediately
saw I was scared to death, and asked what was the trouble now. I
pointed to my leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Yuck! What are those?" she cried out.</TE>
<TE>   "Varicose veins. I'm going to die."</TE>
<TE>   "Stop it. Call your doctor."</TE>
<TE>   "He's on vacation. Building his barn." It was true. Like many
orthopedic surgeons he chose as his hobby one that involved a lot of
hammering and sawing and screwing and nailing.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, but he gave you his home number and said to call if
anything came up."</TE>
<TE>   "Not just for a little worry."</TE>
<TE>   "Call him."</TE>
<TE>   I struggled with it, then called him at home. His wife answered
and said he was out in the barn and before I could say don't bother
she was going to get him. I waited, feeling like a real wimp. Here he
is building his barn, and I call him because of a little pain in my
leg and a varicose vein?</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, what's up?" he said in his hearty voice.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you?" I asked, stalling.</TE>
<TE>   "Couldn't be better." He always said that. I felt like hanging up.</TE>
<TE>   I apologized profusely for bothering him, but then, realizing that
my extended apology was keeping him from hammering and sawing on his
barn, I got to the point.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be from the swelling in the quadriceps," he said, "around
the knee, or maybe they were always there and you're just paying more
attention to your leg these days."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, maybe," I agreed, saying to myself not. He was doing what I
as a doctor often did with patients: try to think of why it is not a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably nothing." He paused. "Hey, but if you're really
worried, we can get you an ultrasound."</TE>
<TE>   I said, no, but thanks, and we hung up.</TE>
<TE>   'It's probably nothing'</TE>
<TE>   My wife asked what he said. I told her he reassured me that it was
probably nothing, but that if I wanted I could get an ultrasound. She
asked why didn't I say I wanted one. I had no answer. She suggested
we go out for coffee. She went in alone, so I wouldn't have to
negotiate in and out of the car on crutches. I sat there, stewing,
glancing from time to time at my little varicose veins and focused on
one word he had said to me, "probably," as in "probably nothing."
Probably? Why didn't he say definitely? From probably I could die. I
still had the pain in my calf, I still had my varicose veins and I
now was even more informedly worried that death was just around the
corner.</TE>
<TE>   But to call him back, again, to interrupt that crucial moment in
the celebratory barn-raising when the big oak beam was being hammered
home into the snug oak slot? To feel like a total jerk because I
couldn't even make up my mind the first time?</TE>
<TE>   My wife got back into the car and asked me -- as if she didn't
know -- what I was going to do. I picked up the cell phone. His wife
was just as cheerful, and just as willing to trundle on out to the
barn.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry to ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I know, you're worried. I'll order the ultrasound right
now, you go in this afternoon and I'll call you back with the
result."</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to bother you."</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I'd rather you call me, 'cause we both sleep better at
night. I'll get my secretary to call right now."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later I went in for an ultrasound. Everything was
hanging on this test. Imagine my surprise when a very young woman --
she looked like she could neither legally drink nor vote -- came in
and introduced herself as "the ultrasound trainee." My informed worry
hit the roof.</TE>
<TE>   I knew all too well that trainees are, well, just trainees. What I
needed was experience. I gently asked Ms. Trainee if her work would
be checked by the regular technician. She said it would. On she went,
doing the test slowly and, to my mind, sloppily. Finally, her
supervisor -- old enough to both drink and vote -- came in and
repeated the test, quickly and meticulously, and announced with not a
shred of doubt in her voice, "It's normal."</TE>
<TE>   My relief was immense and transforming. My informed worry
disappeared -- and it was to turn out to be the last worry, informed
or uninformed, that I had with my recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Doctor-patient connection</TE>
<TE>   What did I learn? That worry can be crippling and self-fulfilling,
and that the only reassurance is that your doctor is available and
invested in not being done in by informed worry about his patients. I
had a sense that he cared about what happened, not only to my hip,
leg and body but to my spirits. And he knew that he couldn't reassure
me himself, but that a test could. Did he worry about the cost, about
justifying it to the managed-care bandits? If he did, I never heard
about it. Did he worry especially about me because I too was a
doctor? Well, he told me when he called back with the test result
that another patient, not a doctor, with similar pain, had come in
that day, did have a DVT and could have died. Dr. B. never made me
feel I was bothering him. I felt he wanted to stay in good connection
with me through a rough time, that he had an authentic wish to know.</TE>
<TE>   Better yet, I imagine that he understood, maybe through his own
experience of informed worry -- perhaps for a loved one or for
himself. What did he understand? That the way we humans grow and heal
is by walking through our suffering with another or with others.</TE>
<TE>   I heard later that he invites his orthopedic residents out to his
place on weekends to help build the barn -- which, apparently, is
always in need of more building. It's got to be about the best
training to become a hip surgeon there is.</TE>

<HD>The emotional explosion of the true fan</HD>
<DH>The heart may be beating wildly when the home team wins,
but it's the brain that captivates researchers as science observes
the chemical chaos at work.</DH>

<LD>Love may be a many-splendored thing, and friendship a comfort
forever, but the late-inning home run that sent the Angels to the
World Series was an emotional event that dropped some red-clad
grown-ups to their knees in tears.</LD>
<LD>   "Release," said lawyer James Spitser, 63, of Los Angeles. An
Angels fan since the team's founding in 1961, he witnessed the Adam
Kennedy homer from the stands. "Pure release and joy. People around
me were losing it, and the noise was unbelievable. We've waited a
long time for this."</LD>
<LD>   For all the action on the field during big sporting events,
there's at least as much physiological churning going on in the
hearts and minds of fans. Recent findings in neurology and
biochemistry suggest that the rewards of being a sports fan touch the
very deepest emotional centers of the brain, affecting how we think
and behave in some of the same ways drugs such as cocaine do, but
with a positive effect on our overall health.</LD>
<TE>   The sharp, sudden euphoria after Kennedy's homer -- or after San
Francisco Giant Kenny Lofton's series-winning hit in the National
League championship -- is the result of sudden shifts in brain
chemistry, researchers say. Watching a ballgame is what brain
researchers describe as an experience of unpredictable reward. In a
tight game, hanging on every pitch, you are suspended between victory
and defeat, unsure when that crucial play will decide the game.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have just begun to observe this emotional state by
doing brain scans on people playing games in which they can win
money. David Zald, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt University, is
using this technique to track levels of a chemical called dopamine,
which appear to rise sharply when people take euphoria-causing drugs
such as cocaine. Dopamine is a chemical messenger thought to
influence brain processes that control emotional response and the
experience of pleasure and pain.</TE>
<TE>   In the anticipatory, edge-of-your-seat phase, circulating dopamine
levels may go down slightly, Zald said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, surges of the stress hormone cortisol are
knotting the stomach by prompting the release of digestive juices and
-- especially for fans of teams that have known futility, like the
Angels and Giants -- actually awakening memories of previous
strikeouts, errors and other blown opportunities, according to Dr.
Hans Breiter, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston who studies how brain chemistry affects expectation and
reward.</TE>
<TE>   When the bat snaps and the ball sails into the home bleachers for
a winning home run, there's probably an instantaneous spike of
dopamine levels in the brains of local fans, said Zald. In a study
due to be presented next month, he measured changes in dopamine
levels in 10 adults playing a card game for money. When the subjects
won a hand, and some dollars, levels spiked significantly, by 7% to
10%. "That's what we think might be causing the feelings of elation,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The people in Zald's study and others like it expect to win some
money, however, and not lose any. Angels fans and Giants fans by
contrast are awash in memories of past failures: Deep down, they were
not expecting victory. "This sets the range of expectancies lower,
like you're spinning a roulette wheel with all negative numbers and
one zero," Breiter said. "So when you spin and it actually comes up
positive -- the Angels won! -- then the effect of the chemical
changes is amplified. We saw the same thing happen here with the
Patriots last year. No one gave them a chance of even getting to the
Super Bowl and they end up winning it, and it was overwhelming" for
some fans.</TE>
<TE>   Tears of joy may well up from just that chemical overload. "The
beauty-queen-contestant effect," Zald said. "I don't think anyone
knows exactly why that happens, but it may be from too much arousal,
where you're getting this reaction, tears, that seems incompatible
with the joy you're feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have long known that testosterone levels also surge in
many devoted fans when their teams are on the march, as do heart
rates and brain waves. In a 1994 study, psychologists in Georgia
analyzed saliva samples from 21 Brazilian and Italian soccer fans
before Brazil beat Italy to win the World Cup. By the end of the
game, the Brazilians' testosterone levels had spiked by about 30%,
while the Italians had plunged by about 30%. The same kind of
response has been shown in college basketball fans. In another
experiment, investigators in Florida found that the sight of the
college football team making spectacular plays produced in local fans
about the same increases in heart rate and perspiration as the sight
of erotic pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Because team attachment often forms in childhood and is associated
with good memories, the bond can lodge deeply in fans' sense of self
and identity. We do not merely like the Dodgers: We are Dodger fans;
we bleed Dodger blue. The team's uniform colors and logo may peek out
in old family pictures, from the hat on grandpa's head to a pennant
pinned to the wall in our first bedroom. "You can get to where you
start to feel that, in a way, that's you out on the field," said
psychologist Daniel Wann of Murray State University in Murray, Ky.,
who studies the connection between sports affiliation and mental
health.</TE>
<TE>   The high arousal some fans get during games stems in part from a
yearning to bathe in the glow of victory, to heal past frustrations
and feel the primitive tug of tribal dominance, psychologists say.
Anyone who has been on campus at a big-time football school after a
homecoming victory knows what that looks like. One investigator found
that college basketball fans considered themselves more sexually
attractive after their team won (a finding one Boston writer
described as the "when Nomar scores, I score" effect, referring to
star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox).</TE>
<TE>   Despite the late columnist Mike Royko's remark that becoming a
Chicago Cub fan is akin to developing a dangerous drug addiction,
intense loyalty even to a bad team does not land fans in emotional
rehab, researchers say. In studies of more than 1,000 fans of sports
from basketball to Australian-rules football, Wann has found that the
attachment buffers people against feelings of loneliness and
depression.</TE>
<TE>   "People who identify strongly with a local team score better on
every measure of psychological health than those who don't identify
with a team," Wann said. "The fans feel a part of something larger.
They're looking around and in this case they're seeing Angels fans
everywhere, and the colors and hats. It provides a sense of community
they might not find elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   This relation holds despite the revolving-door nature of
professional sports, in which players hop from team to team, he said.
Last year the Angels altered more than their roster: They changed
their uniform color. No matter. In at least one neighborhood in
Orange County, after the win that landed the Angels in the World
Series, people poured out of their houses with food and drink. They
partied until dark.</TE>
<TE>   And with the World Series underway, there could be more euphoria
to come.</TE>

<HD>U.S. studies prostate effects of saw palmetto</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saw palmetto, a common palm tree found in the southeastern United
States, is best known as the source of a popular treatment for
prostate problems. The active ingredient comes from an extract of the
tree's berries.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Available as dried berries, teas, tinctures, fluids, gelatin
capsules and tablets, saw palmetto is taken by some men to treat
benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition that affects many men after
age 30. The risk increases with age. Men with the condition may have
increased nighttime urination and trouble urinating.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: The typical dose is 325 milligrams daily. Products that are
considered of high quality are those with labels stating that the
dose contains 85% to 95% fatty acids and sterols, which is the
formula typically used in studies on the herb.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Although benign prostate hyperplasia can be diagnosed
only by a doctor, saw palmetto supplements appear safe and nontoxic.
Taking the supplement does not affect levels of serum
prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is measured during screening
for prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Research: The federal government is conducting a large, randomized
clinical trial to test the effects of saw palmetto for relieving
benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. Several smaller studies have
suggested saw palmetto helps, but those studies generally were of
poor quality.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<LD>The lat pulldown is a terrific back exercise that also targets your
shoulders and biceps. Use fluid motions and remember to keep your
chest lifted throughout the exercise.</LD>
<LD>   1 Select the amount of weight you want to use. Place your hands on
the pulldown bar and sit down on the bench. Extend your arms fully in
a V position. Feel the stretch created in the sides of your back;
inhale. For a secure grip, make sure your palms face forward and curl
your thumbs around the bottom of the bar.</LD>
<LD>   2 Lean back slightly and, as you exhale, pull the bar down,
lowering it to the front of your chest with your elbows pressed to
your sides. Even though you have to lean back, make sure you keep
your spine straight and your abdominals pulled in toward your spine.
Do not bend your wrists; keep them straight and in line with your
forearms. Pause for two beats, then inhale as you allow the bar to
raise up slowly. Repeat 8-12 times, rest for 30 seconds and repeat
for a second set.</LD>

<HD>There's a routine to outfitting a gym</HD>
<DH>Choosing the right equipment often means scouting trade
shows and testing the gear for safety and ease of use. Then there's
the 'crave' factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before a gym member lays one sweaty hand on a piece of equipment,
someone else has taken it for a few test spins, checked under the
hood and kicked the tires.</LD>
<LD>   At the Sports Club/LA, an uber-gym with 130 cardiovascular and 50
weight machines in 100,000 square feet of space, April Morgan finds
and tests the latest fitness equipment, from sophisticated step
trainers to basic dumbbells. While she relies on a team of
technicians, fitness trainers and mechanics to help make the final
stay-or-go decision, she first explores industry trade shows with
colleagues, peruses fitness magazines and stays in touch with
manufacturers to keep current on innovations in the field.</LD>
<LD>   What Morgan, vice president of sports and fitness, seeks in any
piece of equipment can be boiled down to a few obvious key factors --
function, safety, ease of use and comfort -- and some un-obvious ones
such as aesthetics, special features and what she calls the "crave"
factor -- "Would I crave doing this? I feel like I'm an average
member," says Morgan, "so would I want to do this three to five times
a week?"</LD>
<TE>   Elliptical trainers are a case in point. These cardiovascular
machines, which debuted about five years ago, do what they promise --
make the exerciser work up a sweat -- by moving foot pedals in an
elliptical rotation. There is little risk of injury, movements are
not awkward, newer designs are sleekly modern with fairly idiot-proof
programming, and some can be tilted up and down to work different leg
muscle groups. All those combine to make elliptical trainers some of
the most popular pieces in any gym.</TE>
<TE>   While there hasn't been much innovation in free weights, Morgan
says that even small improvements can make a big difference. A
company called Iron Grip added oval cutout handles to their weight
plates (used on barbells), making them easier to pick up. They also
coated some with urethane to cut down on scuffing and clanging.</TE>
<TE>   The International Health, Racquet &amp; Sportsclub Assn.'s annual
early spring trade show is where 46-year-old Morgan, the club's
fitness education manager and a staff mechanic spend several days
scouring booths for new equipment, improved versions of old
equipment, software programs and tools to aid in stretching,
flexibility and balance.</TE>
<TE>   "We just start on one end and go through," says Morgan, who
dresses in workout clothes so she can jump on equipment along the
way. "We're just looking for anything new or different, but if we're
opening a new club or starting a new program, we'll look for things
specifically for that." This year, for instance, she and her
colleagues searched for posture-evaluating software programs to help
trainers better analyze their clients' posture.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who has a bachelor's degree in commercial recreation, will
take up to 20 minutes trying out a piece of equipment to see if all
factors are in place. Her colleagues also weigh in: "Our chief
engineer asks a lot of questions," she says, "from how safe the
machine is to what kind of motor it has and even what kind of screws
it uses."</TE>
<TE>   If a piece passes that first stage, it's shipped to the Sports
Club corporate offices for more evaluation. "We basically do an
autopsy on the machine," she says. "Someone takes it apart and does a
thorough inspection to see how it's built, if it's high quality, and
if it's going to last."</TE>
<TE>   After making it though that step, the machine is given the acid
test--some 30 fitness trainers try it out. They're encouraged to
write comments, pro and con. But Morgan says once a piece of
equipment gets to this stage, reactions are rarely mixed: "By the
time we look at it at the trade show and have it sent here, we have a
pretty good sense of what will work and what won't. We really screen
them."</TE>
<TE>   About four to 10 pieces are chosen from a single convention, and
those might be supplemented throughout the year with equipment sent
by manufacturers or found in trade publications. A single
cardiovascular machine can cost $7,000.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan tries to separate trendy equipment and exercise programs
from those with staying power. Slide Reebok, for instance, where
participants wear special booties and slide across a special mat, was
touted as the next new thing in many clubs several years ago, only to
fizzle out soon after.</TE>
<TE>   But Morgan does have high hopes for a new product that takes off
on the popularity of cardio boxing classes -- punching bags on a
track system that allows them to be easily pulled out for classes,
replacing cumbersome and heavy free-standing bags. Morgan is also
high on a new cardiovascular machine that she calls a hybrid of an
elliptical trainer and a step climber.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the stuff that just makes her wonder what the
inventor was thinking. "I saw this one posture analysis system that
scans the person and provides a printout that shows everything" --
every lump, bump and bulge. Says Morgan, "I think it would make them
think about something other than their posture."</TE>
<TE>   Gym owner Todd Tramp takes a slightly different approach to new
equipment. The owner of the private gym Todd Tramp's Bodysculpting
L.A. in West Hollywood says he's in no rush to fill his
20,000-square-foot gym with the latest pieces: "When new stuff comes
out, I wait and see how popular it gets," he says. "I'm not one to
jump on things right away. People are always asking for new machines
that they've heard of, and I do listen, but I try to make decisions
that are best for everyone in the gym."</TE>
<TE>   His list of criteria is topped by how "smooth" the machine feels,
how it looks, how much weight it can handle ("I have a lot of
competitive bodybuilders working out here"), what kind of warranty it
has, and how comfortable it is. "I put comfort last," he says,
"because everyone's comfort level is different. It's really the
movement of the machine that is so important, the flow of it."</TE>
<TE>   Tramp relies on word of mouth, trade publications and information
from manufacturers for updates on equipment and when he does try out
a new piece, he has his manager and trainers weigh in as well. He
regrets one piece of cardio equipment he bought on an impulse that
ultimately turned out to be a dud. "We set it outside as a piece of
art," he says. "Isn't that sad?"</TE>

<LD>Tanita Family Body Fat Monitor/Scale: The user programs age, gender,
height and activity level (from inactive to athlete) into the
machine, which sends a small electrical current through the feet.</LD>
<LD>   The current travels at different rates through water and fat-free
mass than it does through fat, and the measure of that current
determines the amount of body fat. The technique, called
bioelectrical impedance analysis, is safe, says the company, but
cautions that people with pacemakers or other implanted medical
devices should not use it.</LD>
<LD>   While body fat monitoring can be a good way to get and stay fit,
Dr. David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition,
says machines marketed to consumers may not be sufficiently
calibrated. And the technique may not render a precise body fat
measurement, he says. "It's not going to hurt you," Heber says, "but
you can also use other methods to calculate body fat, such as the
body mass index" which is determined by height and weight
measurements. The machines, he adds, are good for home monitoring,
but only if the user gets a more accurate reading from a physician or
health professional first.</LD>

<HD>Insurers decide that not all hospitals are created equal</HD>
<DH>Consumers will pay more for using facilities not on a
plan's list. This setup raises red flags about quality of care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Trudy Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When choosing health insurance this fall, many consumers will notice
something new that's going to affect their pocketbooks. It used to be
that it didn't matter which hospital your doctor sent you to -- you'd
pay the same amount out of pocket. But some of California's largest
medical insurers are pushing new health plans that will require you
to pay more to go to hospitals that insurers consider too pricey.</LD>
<LD>   Blue Shield of California, for example, is marketing an option
that would require members to pay 30% of their hospital bill (a
co-insurance fee) instead of 20% for using a hospital not on the
insurer's preferred list. A $5,000 hospital bill, for example, would
mean paying $1,500 out of pocket instead of $1,000. PacifiCare has
plans that would require paying up to $400 extra for using a
non-preferred facility.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital tiering, as the practice is called, is part of a strategy
to group hospitals on the basis of cost and use that system to
determine co-payments and co-insurance. The cost for medical care,
primarily for hospitals and prescription drugs, is rising rapidly and
insurers are looking for ways to pass some increases to patients.
Hospital tiering programs are similar to those used for insurers'
prescription drug programs, in which consumers pay more out of pocket
for brand-name drugs and less for generic substitutes.</LD>
<TE>   In theory, the concept of tiered pricing pressures hospitals to
lower their costs to gain a spot on insurers' "preferred" lists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing an increase in hospital use," says David Joyner,
senior vice president at Blue Shield. "When we look at hospital costs
for an area, we find inexplicable differences between hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers, pressed by employers to reign in premiums especially in
a sluggish economy, are trying to compete for important customers by
selling less costly plans. If they can do that by getting their
members to foot more of the bill, it helps them attract more
business. "It's a great win-win," says Dr. Sam Ho, PacifiCare's chief
medical officer. "The only stakeholders who lose are the
worse-performing providers."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly. What about people who live in areas where there is no
low-cost hospital? What about patients whose doctors are unable to
admit patients to lower-cost hospitals? Insurers say patients should
talk to their physicians about changing hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   What about the uninsured, who tend to go to large academic centers
or teaching hospitals for services they need but can't afford? If
millions of Californians are steered to low-cost hospitals, these
teaching hospitals, which tend to have higher costs, may be left with
the burden of treating more of the uninsured. "The amount of
uncompensated care is typically higher at an academic medical
center," says Thomas Priselac, chief executive of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles, a teaching hospital. It takes more
money, he says, "to educate new physicians and professionals and
develop the cutting-edge research methodologies."</TE>
<TE>   Some insurers are beginning to study the relationship between a
hospital's cost and the quality of medical care it provides. For the
average patient, though, this information is difficult to sort
through and compare. Each insurer has its own method of combining
data on cost and quality. With each carrier going its own way,
confusion results.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that people tend to distrust information if there
are conflicting sources, says Judith Hibbard, a health policy
professor at the University of Oregon and an expert in consumer
information needs.</TE>
<TE>   As a patient, I want to know the chances of coming out of a
hospital alive. Working at the not-for-profit Institute for
Healthcare Improvement in Boston, Brian Jarman, a British researcher,
has ranked the 6,200 hospitals in the U.S. using Medicare death rates
and cost data for about 20 million cases. He has made hundreds of
adjustments to the data to arrive at an apples-to-apples comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "Death rates," says Jarman, "are the only reliable measure of
quality. I don't know of any that are better." Jarman's data show no
relationship between the cost of care and mortality rates. "If you
were to choose a hospital with a very high cost, that hospital could
have a high or a low death rate," he says. California hospitals,
Jarman adds, have very high costs, but score as a whole about average
for mortality rates.</TE>
<TE>   If I need gallbladder surgery and know that a particular hospital
in Los Angeles had the best mortality rates, as determined by a
credible source, I might decide that paying the extra price to go
there was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   However, the information about quality medical care available to
Californians is spotty and published by different groups with their
own goals and interests. Insurers are encouraging patients to choose
hospitals based on price, when they should be directing them to
hospitals with high quality medical care, based on reliable data that
can be easily understood by consumers. Financial incentives may serve
the goals of managed care firms and employers, but they are doing
little to get patients to hospitals giving the best care.</TE>

<HD>Knee recovery is generally good, in time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Oakes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've just injured my knee (an ACL tear) and was curious about the
most-common knee injury. Is this injury related to any specific
sports? And what's recovery like after surgery?</LD>
<LD>   A tear in the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, is indeed one of
the most prevalent sports-related knee problems (along with tears in
the meniscus, the cartilage that cushions the joint). The ACL, which
connects the tibia to the femur and helps stabilize the knee, is
often torn during skiing, soccer, basketball or other activities that
involve jumping and turning.</LD>
<LD>   Simple tendinitis recovery can last four to eight weeks, according
to Dr. Laith Farjo, a Michigan orthopedic surgeon who lectures
nationally. But if reconstruction is required, recovery can take
three to six months, depending on the type of treatment, and it
usually requires significant physical therapy.</LD>
<TE>   Recovery time is usually quicker with arthroscopic surgery than
with a more invasive operation. But prior level of activity,
dedication to rehab and general health also play a role in recovery
time.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that most people can return to their favorite
activities, with some limitations. People who need surgery but opt
not to have it, Farjo says, often can't return to the previous level
of exertion. But normal daily activities should present few problems.</TE>
<TE>   What if you want to use a stability ball as a chair in the office
(balancing while working). Should the ball be bigger?</TE>
<TE>   The stability ball does make a perfect chair, and the size used
for your lower-back exercises and balance work should be fine. Most
manufacturers have size charts to help you choose an appropriate
size.</TE>
<TE>   Using a stability ball as a chair can help align your body
naturally and can easily be used at work or home. (My husband bought
five big stability balls for his colleagues so he wouldn't be the
only person sitting on one.)</TE>
<TE>   Be advised, though: You will be forced to use your stabilizing
"core" muscles, so stretch periodically to loosen up. Some newer,
specially designed balls have feet-like protrusions that prevent the
ball from rolling too much.</TE>

<LD>Male and female weight lifters appear to take different approaches to
preventing injuries, a new study indicates, although both sexes
report that the more years they've been lifting, the more injuries
they've sustained.</LD>
<LD>   Men responding to the online survey from the American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons were almost twice as likely as women to use a
spotter, and nearly five times more likely to use a weight belt.</LD>
<LD>   Women led the way in getting trained in proper equipment use, and
they were more than twice as likely to follow a professional
weight-training program.</LD>
<TE>   "It's almost a predictable difference for men and women," said Dr.
Noah Finkel, a sports medicine specialist at Huntington Hospital in
Huntington, N.Y. "Women will have someone show them how to do it ...
whereas men will dive into it."</TE>
<TE>   He also said their style of training is quite different: "Most
women will use light weight and do an exercise more times. Most men
will do it fewer times and do a heavier weight."</TE>
<TE>   Men and women also got their safety information from different
sources. Women tended to rely on a personal trainer or health club
employee, whereas men were more likely to heed friends or read about
safety in books, magazines or on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Weight lifting led to more than 197,000 injuries in 2000 that
required treatment at a doctor's office, clinic or emergency room,
according to the U.S. Product Safety Commission. The cost in lost
wages, medical bills, pain, suffering and legal liability exceeded
$2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 410 people who completed the survey trained or lifted
weights three times a week, with men tending to devote an hour and
women a half-hour to a session.</TE>
<TE>   Of reported injuries, 79% involved inflammation, 58% muscle sprain
or strain and 24% tendinitis. The most vulnerable injury site was the
shoulder, followed by the lower back.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the survey, conducted in July and August, were released
Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>In the old days, women washed clothes in a stream, cooked over an
open fire and didn't give their men any sass. They had no desire to
hunt with the boys or to engage in any of the activities that were
considered in the male domain. And they were always available for the
guys when the guys wanted them.</LD>
<LD>   As time passed, women were allowed to join clubs, lunch with the
girls, have their hair done, shop, and work as teachers and
secretaries. Their primary functions, however, remained in the
washroom, the kitchen and the bedroom. But just about the time their
skills in these areas were reaching an optimum, something happened.</LD>
<LD>   A drive to free women, known as the Feminist Liberation Movement,
came into being. The idea puzzled men because they never considered
women to be unfree. They were just doing the female kinds of things
that God had intended, plus a few more that the guys had allowed.</LD>
<TE>   Feminist militants didn't see it that way. They began burning
their bras, which was OK with the guys, but then began demanding
their place in areas once limited to men. This occurred at about the
same time as the Pill hit the market, which turned the feminist
revolution into a sexual revolution. After that, everything changed.</TE>
<TE>   Women are everywhere today. Well, they always were, but now
they've invaded occupations where they were never expected. They're
soldiers, cops, plumbers, mayors, ditch diggers, sports announcers.
They hang out in bars, smoke cigarettes and often end up in bed with
someone they don't recognize in the morning. They are becoming, God
help us all, just like men.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Rooney is just going to have to accept that.</TE>
<TE>   I mention this today because of the stir that the gruff curmudgeon
of "60 Minutes" has caused by his comments regarding a female
sideline reporter on "Monday Night Football." Specifically, one
Melissa Stark.</TE>
<TE>   While discussing football on a televised sports show, good old
Andy remarked in his usual intemperate manner, "The only thing that
bugs me about television's coverage is those damn women they have
down on the sidelines who don't know what the hell they're talking
about." He was instantly set upon by women across the land, among
whom was Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women.
She was quoted in Time magazine as replying: "Andy Rooney, like my
9-year-old says, is so last month."</TE>
<TE>   Rooney came back by insisting he was only kidding and followed
that up with an online "Homage to Women" column. But it was too late
for a lot of the women who e-mailed me. One of them described in
colorful detail where Rooney would fit on the anatomy of a horse.
Stark just ignored him.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time he's been in trouble for shooting his
mouth off. You may recall that in 1990 he had to apologize for making
a derogatory comment about gays while simultaneously denying that he
had made insulting remarks about African Americans. You'd think that
a guy in communications would know a little bit, at least, about what
not to communicate.</TE>
<TE>   Prettier than John Madden</TE>
<TE>   As for Melissa Stark, I also had a hard time getting used to a
cute little dimpled thing talking about the groin injury of a
238-pound line backer, but I guess I'm more flexible than Rooney. I
accepted it. Also, I like looking at her a lot more than I do John
Madden. She's prettier and considerably calmer. No sudden booms! and
bangs! that have characterized Madden's commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney is not, of course, alone in his attitude. An acquaintance
called to have me speculate on how long it would be before Stark
appeared naked in the pages of Playboy, as though, because she's
attractive and increasingly popular, taking off her clothes would be
the logical next step. I said I thought she had more class than that,
and he replied, "But she's a woman!"</TE>
<TE>   Had Rooney taken the time to read Stark's bio, he'd have
recognized how well qualified she is to do exactly what she's doing.
A 1995 Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Virginia with a double
major in Spanish and world affairs, she began her television career
while an undergraduate and has worked in sports ever since. She's no
amateur and she's no dodo.</TE>
<TE>   I still love Andy Rooney. However, for his own safety, I'd lay off
women if I were him. Just the other day there was the story of a
woman who bit her husband to death because he wouldn't have sex with
her. They don't mess around anymore.</TE>

<HD>A literary son gives voice to Central Coast</HD>
<DH>After limited success as a screenwriter, Thomas Steinbeck
is attracting readers' attention with his colorful Big Sur tales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cracking open his new book, Thomas Steinbeck nervously clears his
throat and apologizes in advance to the small audience for any
sentences he might mangle. "The only person who was a worse reader
than me was my father," Steinbeck explains in his gravelly baritone,
preparing to read his work in public for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The 58-year-old Oxnard resident then launches into a tale
reminiscent of those told by his novelist father, a story drawn from
the colorful characters who settled California's Central Coast, a
hand-spun yarn passed around the Steinbeck family dinner table like
so many home-cooked meals.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Steinbeck was nurtured by such narratives, born into a
family in which storytelling was king, and where the king of all
storytellers was the man who would write "Of Mice and Men" and "The
Grapes of Wrath" and go on to win the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes for
his depictions of fall-down drunks and broken-down crop pickers.</LD>
<TE>   But on this evening, people have gathered at a Santa Barbara
bookstore to hear the words of the son, not the father. And while
Steinbeck expects the comparisons to come, he assures his audience
that he is not trying to emulate his father, nor ride the man's
coattails.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me answer the question everyone asks: No, it wasn't a problem
growing up in my father's shadow," says Steinbeck, who was 24 when
his father died. "There was no shadow. He was all light."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is only fitting that in a year when Californians are
celebrating the 100th anniversary of John Steinbeck's birth with
photo essays, book discussions and film screenings, a new Steinbeck
voice should emerge.</TE>
<TE>   After years of slugging it out as a Hollywood screenwriter with
limited success, Thomas Steinbeck is now on a national book tour to
promote "Down to a Soundless Sea," a collection of short stories
based on the stalwart souls who once populated the rugged Big Sur
coastline. The seven stories take place near the turn of the last
century, tracing the adventures of an eccentric cast of characters,
from sailors and ranchers to doctors and immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was born nearly a decade ago, on a day when Steinbeck was
tossing back tequila and swapping stories with Michael Freed,
developer of Big Sur's Post Ranch Inn. Freed suggested that Steinbeck
incorporate the stories into a book that could grace the rooms of the
cliff-top resort.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, as it neared completion, Steinbeck said his father's
agents caught wind of the project and asked to take a look. They
shopped it to New York-based Ballantine Books, which promptly signed
Steinbeck to a two-book deal. The initial run of 30,000 volumes hit
bookstores earlier this month, riding a wave of critical praise.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers Weekly said the family's literary legacy was in good
hands. Author Pat Conroy and playwright Terrence McNally applauded
Steinbeck's inherited love of a good story, suggesting that the
collection would have made his father proud.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of readers have packed book signings from San Francisco
to Santa Barbara, including one event before an overflow crowd at the
National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   "I am as mystified as you are, believe me," Steinbeck said of the
response. "My writing most of my life has been dedicated toward
making a living, and I haven't had the luxury of saying, 'Oh, I think
I'll write the great American novel.' The fact is, somebody in my
family has already pulled it off, and I've got no desire to compete
with that."</TE>
<TE>   But he has earned praise in his own right. "Thom is a brave
writer, and not just because of the legacy he's tackling," said
Steinbeck's editor, Dan Smetanka, an Orange County native who is
pleased to see a return to stories chronicling California's rich and
colorful past. "He's got the family name, and that's kind of like the
big opening presence in the room. But ultimately, the book will stand
on its own."</TE>
<TE>   Shaped by his father</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York but raised on both coasts, Thomas Steinbeck said
his father taught him and his brother, John, much about writing.
Shaped by the Depression, the elder Steinbeck thought it a blessing
to have work of any kind, his son recalled. And he believed that
writing was a craft, no more or less noble than the work practiced by
mechanics or shoemakers.</TE>
<TE>   He was not one to read his stories aloud to family and friends.
But stories around the dinner table were a different matter, and the
Steinbeck boys grew up surrounded by fanciful tales polished and
practiced by aunts and uncles and, of course, their father, who
reveled in stories that served as entertainment and oral history.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was addicted to raconteurs and liars," Steinbeck said.
"And as children, we were always encouraged to have good stories to
tell, and we were judged on how well we told them."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbeck honed those tales over the years, through his time at
the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and UCLA's film school,
through the years he served in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Friends who have heard the stories are pleased that he decided to
put them down on paper, despite reservations about comparisons to his
father or the criticism he might receive from people convinced he was
trying to benefit from the family name.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a difficult path, but I think Thom is up to it,"
said Kim Greer, chief executive of the National Steinbeck Center,
where Steinbeck serves on the board of trustees. "Although he shares
some things with his dad, he is his own person and he has his own
passions."</TE>
<TE>   Friend and entertainment attorney Phillip Rosen shares that view:
"I would think it would be incredibly intimidating, but he doesn't
seem cowed by it. He's a supremely talented guy, and I think he
really is showing that his work can stand on its own."</TE>
<TE>   And so it does on a recent evening at Borders Books &amp; Music Cafe
in Santa Barbara, where Steinbeck has concluded his first public
reading and is opening the floor to questions.</TE>
<TE>   He is immediately drawn into a conversation about the family
tradition of telling stories, but he lets the crowd know he never
intended to put any of them on paper, much less assemble them into a
book. For that, Steinbeck jokes, he has a long list of people to
blame, including his wife, Gail, who serves as his front-line editor
and all-around taskmaster.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was her work that sealed the book deal in the first
place. And it's her fault that he's being dragged into the spotlight
from the relative anonymity of Oxnard, where the couple moved several
years ago from West Los Angeles because Steinbeck was more
comfortable around farm workers than movie executives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been dragged into it, kicking and screaming," Gail Knight
Steinbeck said. "But this has really been wonderful for him. I think
he is finally feeling like he has found his own voice and finally
started to feel comfortable standing on his legs."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbeck better get used to the attention. He is scheduled for a
book signing in New York today, then goes to Chicago before returning
west. And he will soon start work on his second book, a historical
novel focusing on early California immigration.</TE>
<TE>   He can't wait to get to it, especially since it means he will be
able to escape the public stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really thought of myself as a writer of books, so this is
all a complete shock to me," he said. "It's not like I set out at 58
to be competition for John Steinbeck. I never thought of myself in
his caliber, so there has never been that confusion for me. In fact,
I'm one of his greatest fans."</TE>

<HD>Billy Graham: The mission never ends</HD>
<DH>The venerable preacher is 83 and frail, but he takes his
evangelistic crusade on the road, as he has since 1947.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IRVING, Texas -- The rainstorm poured through the half-open roof of
Texas Stadium and hit the blue tarp so hard it almost drowned out the
old man's words, and yet the faithful, 34,000 of them, were rapt. The
tall white-haired old man was saying the same thing he said when he
started these rallies back in '47. The same thing he said in '49 when
a three-week Los Angeles crusade exploded into eight weeks, catching
the nation's ear for the first time. The same thing he said in '57
when he held them spellbound in Madison Square Garden for 16 weeks, a
phenomenon so stunning it was covered by national television. The
same thing he'd said to more than 200 million people in more than 180
countries.</LD>
<LD>   He makes it so simple, the faithful reflected gratefully, as the
Rev. Billy Graham held his 412th -- and possibly last -- crusade. He
boils it down: God loves you. Accept Christ as your savior and your
sins will be forgiven. You will be with God for eternity. No threats.
No evil enemy. Almost no reference to hell. Simply surrender to God.</LD>
<TE>   He will be 84 in a couple weeks. He hobbles to and from the
lectern with the assistance of his son, the Rev. William Franklin
Graham Jr., who has already replaced him as chief executive officer
of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Assn. He suffers from Parkinson's
disease and underwent a series of brain operations to drain fluid two
years ago. That began the last-crusade speculation, but he kept going
-- to Jacksonville, Louisville, Fresno, Cincinnati and, last week,
North Texas, which had not seen him since 1971 and did not expect to
see him again. No further crusades are scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that death is going to come to me in the near future,"
Graham said late in his half-hour address Friday night, the second of
four scheduled evenings. "But, by God, because of what Jesus did on
the cross I'm ready -- and happy to go."</TE>
<TE>   He said it the way he says most things, in a calm, dignified North
Carolina accent, with none of the florid exclamations associated with
so many evangelists, yet with the confidence of someone who was an
all-star Fuller Brush salesman before he was a preacher. He was
focusing, as he usually does, on those in the audience who might be
"good" people, who might go to church but who had not formally
accepted Christ. He wanted them to leave their seats and walk down
toward the field, where they would be met by one of thousands of
counselors trained for this moment. "God makes you innocent," he
encouraged them. "He places you in his sights as though you'd never
committed a sin."</TE>
<TE>   His frailty made this moment bittersweet -- sad, yet a chance to
appreciate a lifetime. Imagine if there had been a way for
conservatives to wave goodbye to Ronald Reagan before his gifts were
stolen by age, to watch him deliver one last muscular bromide.
Imagine a stadium basking in a message and a voice that had brought
such comfort for so long. This was Texas Stadium, home of the Dallas
Cowboys, savoring a man who has been nicknamed everything from the
Pope of Protestants to the Elvis of ecumenical evangelism.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of talk among the clergy that this is the end
of an era, that this is like seeing Cal Ripkin break the iron-man
record [for consecutive games played] or Barry Bonds break the
home-run record," said the Rev. Don Holliday, a pastor at Scofield
Memorial Church in Dallas, one of about 50 area pastors who earlier
in the week prayed over every seat in the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes people want to turn out for this. It's a sense they are
watching history in the making."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Dickens, a volunteer in charge of training and coordinating
the counselors for the Dallas crusade, could not help but think of
the unbroken circle. Dickens had been in this stadium as a
seventh-grader in 1971 only because it was new and he wanted to see
it, especially the funny hole in the roof that kept the field open
while protecting the spectators. Yet he was so moved by Graham that
he joined the hundreds who walked down from their seats to make a
commitment to Christ. Today he runs his own ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's poignant for me now because I'm responsible for 9,000
counselors to do what somebody did for me 31 years ago," he said.
"And my sons are now about the same age as I was, and while they've
already chosen to surrender their lives to Christ, it's a lot of fun
watching it through their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   A simple message</TE>
<TE>   Billy Graham, the son of a dairy farmer outside of Charlotte,
N.C., was 16 when he committed to Christ while watching a
fire-and-brimstone Baptist preacher. Ordained as a Southern Baptist
minister in 1940, he took over a radio show and caught fire, then
quit a pastorship for full-time evangelism around the country. Radio
made him bigger still during a series of tent rallies in Los Angeles
in '49. Others had used advertising, publicity campaigns, staffs of
specialists and singers to refine revivalism, but Graham is credited
with perfecting it. The accessibility of his message has led to
mutually beneficial relationships with every U.S. president since
Truman.</TE>
<TE>   Even in his twilight, Graham spoke powerfully at the National
Cathedral in Washington on a national day of prayer after the Sept.
11 attacks. Weeks later a Gallup poll found that he was America's
fifth-most-admired man, behind President Bush, Secretary of State
Colin Powell, then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Pope John Paul
II. "He is an icon essential to a country in which, for two centuries
now, religion has been not the opiate but the poetry of the people,"
wrote Yale University professor Harold Bloom, author of "The American
Religion."</TE>
<TE>   Graham's power, Dickens suggested, lies in two things. First, the
simplicity of his message: "As Christians, we have made this overly
complex. Christ's message was simple: of love, of starting over." And
second, the mechanics of the Graham crusade, in which each person who
steps forward is greeted by a counselor who keeps tabs on him or her
in the weeks ahead. "It's not mass evangelism. It's actually personal
evangelism on a mass scale."</TE>
<TE>   After decades of televangelists caught up in hypocrisy or
political or social campaigns and the more recent Roman Catholic
Church abuse scandal, Graham fulfills a nostalgic fondness for purity
that transcends his Southern Baptist roots. He split with much of the
religious right, for example, by denouncing the violent tactics of
faith-based anti-abortion groups. (One rare moment of embarrassment
occurred earlier this year when he was forced to apologize for
saying, in a newly released taped conversation with President Nixon,
that the Jewish "stranglehold" on the news media was ruining the
country. Graham asked Jews to reflect on a lifetime of actions "that
contradict my words in the Oval Office that day.")</TE>
<TE>   His Minneapolis-based organization has kept its financial records
open to the public for the last half-century. Organizers of the North
Texas events made a point of saying Graham received none of the funds
raised from them. Offerings were requested in a low-key manner to
defray the $3-million cost, and a big-screen video sought donations
of cars, bicycles and bus passes to aid local residents with
transportation problems.</TE>
<TE>   "His message is so sincere," said Skip Carwell of Richardson, a
Dallas suburb, who had seen Graham here in 1971. "I think his
presentation is honest. It's from the heart. It's -- "</TE>
<TE>   " -- God-led," continued his wife, Francene Carwell. "With his
whole ministry, he's been very honest about what his ministry does.
He doesn't keep secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Much about this Billy Graham crusade was different from that in
'71. For one thing, the word "crusade" has been replaced by "mission"
in advertising after Sept. 11, out of sensitivity to Muslims (given
that the Crusades of the Middle Ages were military campaigns to seize
Jerusalem and a large swath of the Middle East from Muslims). The
gospel music had a glossy, sophisticated pop feel. (Singer Jaci
Velasquez sang of feeling God's power "when I'm on my knees" and did
a thundering number in Spanish; country star Randy Travis sang of
feeling "like a newborn baby in the arms of the Lord" at baptism.)
The turnout -- 153,000 for the first three evenings -- was less than
the 75,000-a-night prediction organizers had made. The preacher who
used to speak for hours at a time and plant himself in the heart of a
city for months was rationing his energy, standing at the lectern
with a chair behind him for support, gesturing only occasionally and
with only one hand.</TE>
<TE>   What had not changed was the way Graham gracefully led his flock
to the evening's lone moment of drama, when he challenged them to
make a profound choice. He was doing nothing more than telling
homespun stories and quoting the Bible about sin, hardly trying to
craft applause lines, when suddenly he wondered about all the images
of the cross people use and wear without thinking about what they
mean. Quickly he connected the dots (" ... the cross, first of all,
means that God sees the depth of our sins.... The Bible says you have
to repent sin and seek Jesus in your heart... "). He asked the
audience if they'd ever broken a commandment.</TE>
<TE>   And then he asked those sinners who had yet to accept Christ as
their savior to leave their seats, to join him in surrender. "You're
standing at the crossroads tonight, many of you.... The choice you
make tonight will affect your whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily he would have asked them to approach the huge stage
constructed at one end of the football field, but because of the rain
he told them to simply make their way to a covered seating area. He
marveled at the elements, "this dramatic and wonderful evening." The
organist began to play and Graham bowed his head, and about a
thousand people trickled out of the stands ... into the hard rain, to
the front of the stage, creating a solid sea of multicolored
umbrellas that covered more than half the field.</TE>
<TE>   Now his voice seemed to increase in passion. He prayed with them
-- just three sentences about confessing their sins and accepting
Jesus as their savior. The hardest rain of the day seemed to hit and,
after standing silent at the microphone for a moment, Graham was led
away by his son.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't know what God has in store for him," said Candice
Mallard, who was spending part of the day at a book counter where
many of Graham's 18 best-sellers were sold and the rest of the night
as a spiritual counselor. "You look at him: He has Parkinson's, he's
pretty frail, but when he stands up to speak it's like God puts his
hand on him and he doesn't look like a frail 83-year-old man with
Parkinson's."</TE>

<HD>Monster Massive: It's about the music -- and Halloween
scare tactics</HD>
<DH>Dance-music festival at the L.A. Sports Arena should be
back to its usual rhythm after last year's downturn. The fans want to
party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, the Halloween-themed dance-music festival Monster
Massive attracted almost 40,000 people to the L.A. Sports Arena and
the surrounding grounds. But last year, just a month after 9/11, that
number was reduced by more than half.</LD>
<LD>   Now Halloween 2002 seems poised to recapture the spirit of the
day."I can feel the response just in the hits to our Web sites and
ticket sales," says Reza Gerani, an L.A.-based DJ and the chief
executive of Go Ventures, the company that will stage the fifth
annual Monster Massive on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Monster Massive has not only the party atmosphere of Halloween in
its favor, but also the fact that it is one of the few large-scale
festivals in L.A. this year. Even reliable events such as Nocturnal
Wonderland have been absent in 2002, due in part to the struggling
economy, in part to negative publicity about the rave scene,
according to promoters and others in the business.</LD>
<TE>   That publicity, often focusing on drug use at raves, has made
relations between promoters and authorities problematic, but Gerani
credits Monster Massive's track record as a key to avoiding that
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been doing Monster Massive at the Sports Arena for five
years, and because of that we've proven repeatedly to the city that
we can do these events," he says. "City officials have been to our
events and they know they're about the music."</TE>
<TE>   At a festival of this size, the whole experience -- lights, sound,
videos, setting -- is important, but the music is the foundation, and
Gerani has whittled down more than 200 inquiries to the 50 or acts on
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's DJs include house stars Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May
and Felix Da Housecat on five Halloween-themed stages. Gerani is
particularly excited about Chicago-based DJ Funk, a deep house act
making his first L.A. appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I look for, (a) DJs that can put on a performance, (b) DJs that
haven't been out here too long and don't perform repeatedly, and (c)
I look for what people are asking for," Gerani says. "We take polls
on our Web sites. And that's the equation we use to figure out who's
going to play our next party."</TE>
<TE>   Drum-and-bass star AK1200 (real name: Dave Minner), who will be
playing his first Monster Massive, likes the approach.</TE>
<TE>   "Most promoters end up getting the same lineup they usually get
because they work with the same people all the time," says the
Orlando, Fla., artist. "But these guys wanted to get a few people
they hadn't gotten yet."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most raves. Monster Massive also features live performers,
including the Spacemen and the San Fernando Valley duo Signal, which
has just released its second album, "The Message Is Clear."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Monster Massive's success stems from the spirit of the
holiday, with fans of all ages coming in costumes, the stages
designed to reflect the theme and the spooky but celebratory nature
of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "There's that mysterious feeling about the night of Halloween that
brings out that full moon-type feeling; that kind of eerie, scary
vibe. But it's also a fun night."</TE>

<LD>"OH Muffie, darling, you look so festive tonight!" David Patrick
Columbia says, bussing one Muffie Potter Aston, a socialite in a
white satin bustier. They greet one another inside the lobby of the
City Center, where the American Ballet Theatre is debuting its fall
season. Muffie is married to Dr. Sherrell Aston, the plastic surgeon
responsible for some of New York's best architecture, and tonight the
Astons are co-chairs of the ballet's fund-raising gala -- an A-list
event in the city's social season.</LD>

a bird-watcher. He is an ornithologist. He calls himself a social
diarist, recounting the parties and foibles of aristocrats,
pacesetters and other rich, overachieving New Yorkers. In a
chalk-striped blue suit, he observes the swirl before returning to a
monastic one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. There, four
nights a week, he writes a report for his Web site,
newyorksocialdiary.com. He gets 75,000 hits a week but pays the rent
editing Quest, a monthly magazine chock-full of high-priced real
estate ads delivered free to the co-ops of high society.</LD>
<TE>   If Columbia does not write everything he knows, he certainly knows
a lot about everybody he writes up. He can tell you about the Astons,
their previous marriages, her former job in PR, and Dr. Aston's
former client, the late doyenne Pamela Harriman, who owed her
late-in-life beauty to him. But unlike Dominick Dunne, who goes to
dinner and is pulled aside by the butler, Columbia isn't getting the
dish from the help. Still, he knows about a couple's prenup, the
woman's social lineage, the man's affairs. He can explain why
so-and-so -- and really, who can tell these people apart?-- is so
tan, and why a descendant of the president of Standard Oil of
California named Topper would marry a Southern belle named Tinsley.
(She is 27, pretty, and an heiress who aspires to co-chair. He is 26,
pretty, and a banker who is bored by ballet.) Columbia does live off
the world he chronicles, but he does not share its values. Nor does
he kid himself he is one of them. He is tall, silver-haired, a
chauffeur's son who dropped out of college to be a playwright. That
didn't work, so he moved to L.A., where he wrote an authorized
autobiography for Debbie Reynolds and worked sporadically on TV
courtroom shows. After 14 difficult years, and broke again, he drove
east with three dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Boohoo-ing all the way across the country , I asked myself what
would make me happy," he recalls. "I realized I wanted to write a
social column in New York."</TE>
<TE>   At 61, he is diligent. He owns two tuxedos and goes out almost
every night of the week, covering Blaine Trump's 50th birthday party,
Topper and Tinsley's Virginia wedding, and all those zoo and hospital
balls. He prints flattering photographs of the usual suspects and
sometimes resells them. He talks intelligently at lunch about world
events. His columns are descriptive. Occasionally, he has bite.</TE>
<TE>   And all the birds, in their feathers and plumes, flutter around
him in the hope he can somehow upgrade a few nobodies into the ranks
of the somebodies. "I'm always telling people if you want publicity,
give me a call," Columbia says. "This is a community and my position
is nebulous. But the one thing I can do is give publicity. To me it's
just words to paper. To them, this is life." Liz Smith told him long
ago "you don't get access with vinegar," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And Columbia gets as good as he gives. He sits fourth row center
seat at the ballet. In the fifth row, behind him, are Sam and Judy
Peabody, genuine aristocrats who have raised millions to fight AIDS.
Before the theater darkens for the ballet, Columbia surveys the scene
and concludes: "This is not quite the fancy evening it used to be."
For the last few years, Muffie Potter Aston has seen to it that the
invitation says "festive," instead of "formal." It is just too much
to ask of the men, often reluctant about ballet, to go home and put
on a tuxedo night after night. So Muffie let them off the hook, but
the women dress to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, change is always good in a world where whatever society
is at the moment is not what it is about to become, according to
Charlotte Curtis, a social diarist of an earlier era whose 1976 book
was called "The Rich and Other Atrocities."</TE>
<TE>   The only sure thing is that in-people, their prominence inflated
by their money and how they spend it, will go on, and that ballet
galas will be around to distract from an economy in the tank, CEOs
falling like autumn leaves and impending war.</TE>
<TE>   Flocking to the head table</TE>
<TE>   After two hours of watching beautiful young bodies leaping and
twirling on stage, the gala crowd walks around the block to the
University Club at Fifth Avenue and 54th Street, where they are
joined by the dancers for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the paneled dining room, Columbia meets up with his
photographer, Jeff Hirsch. Columbia directs him to the stars, but it
isn't hard to spot them, even for someone who doesn't know a Trump
from a Koch (pronounced "Coke").The former model in white chiffon on
the arm of the handsome Latin American beer magnate is an obvious
choice. As are the attractive people named Hess and Loomis. Nor does
Columbia forget to take a picture of his boss, the owner of Quest.</TE>
<TE>   The really important people flock to the head table. Columbia is
seated next to them. When Pepe Fanjul makes his entrance, Columbia
raises an eyebrow to Hirsch. Fanjul's celebrated affair with
socialite Nina Griscom this spring has turned this balding sugar
baron into eye candy; everyone stares. Now he is back with his wife
and back in the bosom of New York society. "I know it's difficult for
the wife," Columbia whispers, nodding at the dignified wronged woman,
who looks pinched. It gets late, and Columbia begins to fade,
listening more than he talks. He will see all these people the next
night, and the night after that and again over the weekend. This week
there is the International Art and Antiques Fair and the
French-American and the Asia Society dinners and lunches in
high-profile restaurants with well-placed friends. Now, Columbia must
go. He is among the first to leave. "There you have it," he says,
stepping out to Fifth Avenue. "That's the show."</TE>

<HD>Translation of 'Green Knight' opens a window to the past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gallant knights and lovely ladies of King Arthur's court are
enjoying a Christmas celebration when an enormous ax-bearing green
stranger rides into the hall and issues a preposterous challenge: Any
man who is bold enough may take a swing at his head with the ax and
he will offer no resistance. In return, that man must come to the
Green Knight's place a year hence and allow the big fellow a swing at
his head. When no one in the stunned assembly makes any response,
King Arthur agrees to take up the challenge. At this point, the
king's nephew and bravest knight, Sir Gawain, steps in to relieve his
sovereign of the onus. The green giant obliging bares his neck and
Sir Gawain takes a mighty swing.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what happens next, as relayed to us in modern English by
the latest translator of this medieval verse romance, the
distinguished American poet W.S. Merwin:</LD>
<LD>   The handsome head fell from the neck to the earth</LD>
<TE>   And rolled out among their feet so that they kicked it.</TE>
<TE>   The blood gushed from the body, glittering over the green,</TE>
<TE>   And the knight never staggered or fell, for all that,</TE>
<TE>   But he stepped forth as strong as ever, on unshaken legs,</TE>
<TE>   And reached in roughly among the knights</TE>
<TE>   To snatch up his lovely head and at once lift it high.</TE>
<TE>   And then he turns to his horse and takes hold of the bridle,</TE>
<TE>   Steps into the stirrup and swings himself up,</TE>
<TE>   Holding his head in his hand by the hair,</TE>
<TE>   And settles into the saddle as firmly as ever</TE>
<TE>   With no trouble at all, though he sits there headless.</TE>
<TE>   In due course, the brave and courteous Sir Gawain sets out, with
some trepidation, to fulfill his part of the bizarre covenant. He
must leave the comfort and fellowship of King Arthur's court to seek
out the Green Knight in the untamed wilderness. Before facing the
final, terrifying test, Gawain finds a different kind of challenge en
route, when he stays as a guest at the castle of a hospitable,
hard-riding lord who loves hunting, and the lord's beautiful young
wife, a lady whose idea of hospitality includes offering herself to
the handsome visitor while her husband's out chasing after wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   What's a knight to do? It would be wrong to betray his host, yet a
chivalrous paladin is also supposed to honor the request of a lady.
Readers who enjoy a well-told story, not lacking in sex and violence
but also endowed with a sense of moral purpose, will find a wonderful
one here.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, scholars do not know the name of the poet who penned
the great medieval verse romance "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight."
It is generally believed that the poet lived in the western midlands,
perhaps Cheshire or Lancashire, "somewhere near the Welsh marshes."
Although he (or she) seems to have been roughly a contemporary of
Chaucer's, living in the latter part of the 14th century, the
"Gawain" poet's language and style are redolent of an earlier time
and more rural place than Chaucer's London. College textbooks
generally print "The Canterbury Tales" in Chaucer's brand of Middle
English, with glosses and notes to help the modern reader. In the
case of "Sir Gawain," glosses and notes are not enough and the poem
is usually read in translation.</TE>
<TE>   Most translators of "Sir Gawain" -- including poet Keith Harrison,
scholars Brian Stone and Marie Boroff, and novelist John Gardner --
have opted for verse, attempting to convey a sense of the style and
form of the original, with its alliterative stanzas, each capped by a
rhyming five-line "bob and wheel." This latest verse translation by
the redoubtable Merwin features the text of the original poem on the
left-hand page, so that readers with a mind to do so can compare the
two and see what may have been lost (or found) in translation.</TE>
<TE>   In the original poem, there is a great deal of alliteration, but
there is not as much in Merwin's version. And, in translating the
rhymed "bob and wheel" parts, Merwin often contents himself with
vague feints in the direction of rhyming:</TE>
<TE>   What then?</TE>
<TE>   Gawain and the King smile</TE>
<TE>   And laugh about that green man.</TE>
<TE>   All agreed that he was marvel</TE>
<TE>   Enough for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Stone, for example, renders the same lines thus:</TE>
<TE>   What then?</TE>
<TE>   At the Green Knight Gawain and King</TE>
<TE>   Grinned and laughed again;</TE>
<TE>   But plainly approved the thing</TE>
<TE>   As a marvel in the world of men.</TE>
<TE>   But Merwin's translation has a directness and simplicity that can
be quite powerful:</TE>
<TE>   Gawain said, "I flinched once</TE>
<TE>   And I will not again.</TE>
<TE>   But if my head falls on the stones</TE>
<TE>   I cannot put it back on."</TE>
<TE>   On the minus side, Merwin offers no notes or glosses. Perhaps it
was thought they would slow the reader's progress or lessen the
immediacy of the poem's impact, but a few judicious ones might have
been helpful. Fortunately, Merwin's foreword provides a good overview
of the poem's textual and historical background.</TE>
<TE>   The "Gawain" poet's portrait of knightly chivalry, Merwin reminds
us, was written during the Hundred Years' War, "an era of grotesque
and all but constant violence between the English and the French ...
while the Arthurian stories traveled back and forth in waves, as
entertainment, across those same areas." Slaughter, rape, pillage and
plunder were the order of the day, and there was even more profit to
be made from capturing hostages and holding them for ransom.</TE>
<TE>   The romantic ideal of the Round Table cloaked an ugly reality. Or
perhaps the vision of Camelot expressed the innermost dreams of all
who longed for a better way. Whatever the case, "Sir Gawain and the
Green Knight" endures -- charming, strange, tantalizingly mysterious
-- and Merwin's translation catches at least some of the gleam of its
vanished world.</TE>

<HD>Theater in Seattle lures Taper's Egan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Egan, producing director of the Mark Taper Forum and a staff
member there since 1984, will leave to become the artistic director
of ACT Theatre in Seattle next year.</LD>
<LD>   Egan is best known in Los Angeles as the founder and director of
the Taper's New Work Festival, an annual series of workshops and
readings of developing plays. He also has staged a number of
main-stage productions, including "Arcadia," "Closer," "Sansei" and
Shakespeare's "Richard II" and "Measure for Measure."</LD>
<LD>   For many years Egan was considered a possible replacement for
Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson, who has announced that he
will retire at the end of 2004. Davidson said Egan is "still a
potential candidate" for the top Taper job, but the Center Theatre
Group board that oversees the Taper was not able to respond to the
Seattle offer because of the group's current "process of transition."
However, he noted that Egan, as previously announced, will stage Jon
Robin Baitz's "Ten Unknowns" next year at the Taper and that other
people have left the Taper staff and then returned.</LD>
<TE>   Egan could not be reached for comment but in a statement released
by ACT said, "This is an incredible opportunity that I couldn't pass
up."</TE>
<TE>   Formerly known as A Contemporary Theatre, ACT operates a 434-seat
arena stage, a 409-seat thrust stage and two smaller flexible spaces
-- all within Kreielsheimer Place, a rehabilitated building in
downtown Seattle. The company has nearly 11,000 subscribers and a
budget of approximately $6 million -- approximately half the size of
the Taper's.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited for him," Davidson said. "It's a good theater with a
modest budget, but it's interested in new work, which is part of
Bob's strength."</TE>

<HD>'Girls Club's' version of law is disorder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox's new "Girls Club" is about three young attorneys who are
beautiful when they're angry.</LD>
<LD>   Which is often.</LD>
<LD>   Lynne Camden (Gretchen Mol) is mad because senior partner William
Hahn (Giancarlo Esposito) is on her case. Sarah Mickle (Chyler Leigh)
is mad because another partner, Meredith Holt (Lisa Banes) --
nicknamed "Praying Mantis" -- is on her case. Jeannie Falls (Kathleen
Robertson) is mad because partner Spencer Lewis (Brian Markinson) is
repeatedly on her neck and shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   With his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne, Sarah and Jeannie are 27-year-old graduates of the same law
school who somehow wound up working at the same posh law firm in San
Francisco, where they have bouncy hair, share a fancy pad and spend
evenings hemorrhaging self-pity and telling each other how teed they
are at their bosses.</TE>
<TE>   If "Girls Club" sometimes acts like a shampoo commercial, it also
holds your interest when Lynne becomes the first of the roommates to
get her own case defending an accused murderer who may have the hots
for her. The courtroom stuff is rather unrealistic, though, as is
some of the dialogue throughout the hour, with executive
producer-writer David E. Kelley extending his practice of dabbling in
the surreal.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls Club" follows "Boston Public," granting Kelley (who also
gave America the vastly better "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice") a
Monday-night franchise on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Litigation meets libido in Episode 2. Boyfriends, romance and sex
show up, as does Stacy Keach as a seedy former congressman whom Sarah
tries to recruit to assist on a case even though he's a drunk and a
loose cannon. Not liking that one bit is Holt the Mantis, whose main
job is to poke her head into associates' offices and sneer.</TE>
<TE>   There are several keys here. When one of the partners begins a
sentence with "Let me tell you something" or "In my office," expect a
lecture. When one of the "girls" walks in slow motion, you know a
Serious Moment is nearing. Expect lots of those.</TE>
<TE>   When your responses operate in slow motion, it's time to turn this
off.</TE>

<HD>Rocio Durcal returns in exquisite vocal form</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's always sad and uncomfortable to see great vocalists try to
perform past their prime. So a certain trepidation foreshadowed the
return of Spanish singer Rocio Durcal to the stage of the Universal
Amphitheatre on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Durcal, one of the glorious voices in Latin pop music, had not
appeared here in a couple of years. She hasn't had a hit record for
much longer. She just turned 58 on Oct. 4, and she is reportedly
recovering from cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Who would expect Durcal to emerge in top form and deliver a
passionate, exquisitely skilled performance that surpassed shows
during her 1980s heyday at this same venue? But that's what she did
during a 90-minute set that thrilled loyal fans.</LD>
<TE>   From the start, with her signature torch song "La Gata Bajo la
Lluvia," it was exhilarating to see the former actress in complete
command of her pure vocal prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Durcal still has it all -- the emotional force, the finesse, the
masterful control.</TE>
<TE>   And of course the rich repertoire. During her recording career,
Durcal alternated between contemporary pop ballads and mariachi
numbers, especially by ever-popular composer Juan Gabriel, whose
songs made her beloved in Mexico. Nobody does Gabriel better than
Durcal, who adorns his bravado with her flamenco grace.</TE>
<TE>   She carefully balanced that familiar material Saturday and added
tunes from more recent albums, especially last year's overlooked
"Entre Tangos y Mariachi." The singer switched costumes as readily as
she switched genres and reinforced her six-piece backup band with the
rousing 13-man Mariachi Premier from Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   She closed with Gabriel's heart-wrenching "Amor Eterno," a song
about loss and yearning that she delivered with deep feeling and an
enthralling flourish. The crowd showered her with deserved shouts of
"Bravo!"</TE>

<HD>'Major Barbara' breaks in a new venue with stylish grace</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a tradition in the theater: Instead of wishing an actor "good
luck" backstage before a performance, you say, "Break a leg," so
nobody will.</LD>
<LD>   It is not a tradition to offer the same wish to the audience
members.</LD>
<LD>   But such a custom might have been helpful at South Coast
Repertory's Saturday matinee performance of "Major Barbara" -- the
first production at the shiny new Folino Theatre Center in the
Segerstrom Center for the Arts -- when a visitor unaccustomed to the
theater's shallow new stairs and unworn carpet took a fall on the way
to his seat. After that, arriving patrons got an anxious plea along
with their program: "Pleeease, watch your step."</LD>
<TE>   But the man was OK, no limbs broken. And the new theater, a
contemporary, streamlined wonder of glass curves and pale wood,
proved a fitting home for the lively, crisp and elegantly staged
"Major Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   This production starts off a bit stiff and self-conscious, and a
few of the oddly affected British accents seem to sink on their way
across the Atlantic. But things soon warm up under the deft direction
of company artistic director Martin Benson, and George Bernard Shaw's
1905 play -- a three-hour diatribe on religion, morality, social
class, charity, poverty, wealth, power, capitalism, socialism,
pacifism and war -- never gets weighed down by its length or the heft
of its subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its strong and still relevant social messages, "Major
Barbara" is also a festival of wit, a comedy of manners; this bright
production wisely plays up the humor and absurdity of the situation
and lets Shaw's well-articulated political worldview speak for
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw sets up the age-old debate over how best to rid the world of
poverty through a conversation between millionaire arms manufacturer
Andrew Undershaft (Dakin Matthews) and his daughter, Barbara (Nike
Doukas), whom he has not seen since childhood, and who has grown up
to be a proud major in the Salvation Army.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by a dithering chorus of self-involved family members,
father and daughter throw down a challenge to each other: Andrew will
visit the Salvation Army to see how Barbara and her colleagues
attempt to save the poor with a crust of bread and the promise of
heaven -- but only if she will then pay a visit to his arms factory,
to see how he has created a utopian society that pulls the poor from
the gutter by offering them money and security in return for helping
him build a fortune through death and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's clear by the end which argument Shaw favors, for an
audience it may remain a matter of opinion. But when it comes to the
actors' performances, Matthews' insolently charming Undershaft is the
hands-down winner. His dryly whimsical delivery belies the steel of
his words, and his ability to pledge his allegiance to money and
gunpowder in the same tone one might order a nice spot of tea proves
once again that the devil is almost always more interesting than the
saint.</TE>
<TE>   Doukas' Barbara proves a weak adversary. She's one of those cast
members whose accent occasionally defies geography, and her energy
and spunk seem forced and arbitrary, rather than inspired by any
particular devotion to saving souls. Even within the context of the
absurdity of the proceedings, the other characters achieve a
naturalism that eludes Doukas, who merely comes across as shrill.</TE>
<TE>   JD Cullum turns in a hilarious and strongly nuanced performance as
Barbara's intended, the Greek scholar Adolphus Cusins, struggling to
rationalize his love for the daughter with his increasing admiration
for the father. And Kandis Chappell radiates a world-weary common
sense as the stolid Lady Britomart, whose faulty logic on most
subjects never once prevents her from speaking her mind.</TE>

<HD>Raffi's easy charm as toddler troubadour survives test of
time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>By Lynne Heffley Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD></LD>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen, Elvis, the Pied Piper - take your pick. Raffi,
the No. 1 children's music star since he first began crooning about a
certain little "Baby Beluga" nearly 25 years ago, has been compared
to all three. Judging by enthusiastic shouts of "Waffi! Waffi!" and
the number of small fry and their adult companions who packed
Brentwood's Wadsworth Theatre on Saturday -shaking their "sillies
out," barking, mooing and tweeting on cue, acting out all the verses
to "Wheels on the Bus" and bopping along to "Down by the Bay" - the
comparisons still apply, proving the agelessness of children's music.
No bells and whistles, no ear-assaulting amplification, no fancy set
pieces, no puppets, no gimmicks. Just gentle, brown-eyed,
salt-and-pepper-bearded Raffi at his most relaxed and playful, with
an umbrella and a hat for props, his guitar and that big, mellow,
velvety baritone, sharing old favorites and an eclectic mix of new
songs. The rare event was the only L.A.-area stop on Raffi's major
U.S.-Canada concert tour, sparked by the recent release of "Let's
Play," his first new album in seven years. And after earning loud
appreciation for assuring that, yes, he would be singing his
signature "Baby Beluga," Raffi opened with the new album's title
track {mdash} an irresistible tune that pays subtle tribute to guitar
great Django Reinhardt. Then, while the smallest fans were taken on
bathroom runs, given a bottle or two and bounced on parental knees,
Raffi joked, executed some smooth dance moves, sang a capella and
with his own dynamic accompaniment, and made joyful music out of a
set ranging from "May There Always Be Sunshine" to a piercingly sweet
new second verse to "Eensy Weensy Spider." His encore number, "Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot," might have disappointed fans who shouted out for
such Raffi faves as "Everything Grows," but it proved to be an
unexpectedly soulful sing-along.  In one highlight, Raffi didn't sing
at all. He asked the audience to sing to him, and his quiet, smiling
response to young and old voices warbling "Twinkle Twinkle, Little
Star" made it seem as if it were a gift.</TE>

<HD>'Canada!' salutes the CBC at 50</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Holt</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While "blame Canada" remains the rant of many film workers opposed to
production going north, the Museum of Television &amp; Radio is choosing
instead to salute Canada for a half century of production.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with a party Wednesday night, the Beverly Hills museum is
throwing a birthday celebration of sorts for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., the government-subsidized network that is
celebrating its 50th anniversary.</LD>
<LD>   The CBC was also saluted Wednesday by the New York branch of the
Museum of Television &amp; Radio.</LD>
<TE>   The 14-week exhibition -- "O Canada! A Salute to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp." -- spotlights some of the risks undertaken to
produce the controversial, the weird, the banal and the boring.</TE>
<TE>   Although such names as Uncle Chichimus, Howie the Turtle and Don
Messer are likely to be wasted on all but the most nostalgic
Canadians living here, the show also features household names in the
U.S. who originated in Canadian households.</TE>
<TE>   The CBC's mandate is the same now as it was when it went on the
air at 7:15 p.m., Sept. 8, 1952: Promote Canadian culture.</TE>
<TE>   "For the private sector in Canada, it pays to buy U.S.
programming," CBC President Robert Rabinovitch says. "For the private
sector, it doesn't pay to do Canadian content. So who's going to do
it? Who's going to tell the Canadian stories? Who's going to show
hockey? Our role is to ensure and develop Canadian content."</TE>
<TE>   Local network executives might want to check out "O Canada!" if
they've paid serious attention to the recent success of edgy,
award-winning, quality cable shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Like HBO, the CBC has the capability to do shows like 'The
Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under' because we're not driven by delivering
eyeballs. We don't have to win the ratings contest," Rabinovitch
says.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the three-month bill are the outrageous Kids in the Hall
comedy show produced by "Saturday Night Live" creator Lorne Michaels,
the popular "Degrassi High" series already familiar to American
audiences and cult favorite poet-musician Leonard Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Two directors of "Cinema Creepy" are featured in the three-month
lineup: David Cronenberg, responsible for "Crash" and "Dead Ringers,"
and Atom Egoyan, who did "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Exotica." Both
cut their teeth on CBC shows.</TE>
<TE>   "The CBC is an incubator of talent," Rabinovitch says. "We filmed
Celine Dion singing at 12 years old."</TE>
<TE>   The CBC vault holds 50 years of pre-fame faces now well known in
the U.S., including Michael J. Fox, Martin Short, Robert Goulet and
Alex Trebek.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian actor Adam Beach, star of the summer war movie
"Windtalkers," attended the opening of the CBC series and called the
network "a great showcase for Canadian talent."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Meyboom, who produced the mockumentary "Escape From the
Newsroom" that premiered at the museum Wednesday, said, "The CBC is a
good place to take an idea that perhaps won't fit anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian government subsidizes 60% of the CBC, with the
balance of its budget split evenly between advertising revenue and
worldwide licensing agreements.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Uncle Chichimus was the bald puppet that jumped in
to explain technical difficulties experienced the first day of CBC's
broadcast in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Beside him on that night was 25-year-old floor director Norman
Jewison, who went on to direct such Oscar-winning films as
"Moonstruck," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Fiddler on the Roof."</TE>

<LD>Dead men talking....</LD>
<LD>   On one of the city's busiest freeways, familiar faces greet
gridlock from a pair of billboards advertising their respective new
daytime shows, "Dr. Phil" and "Beyond With James Van Praagh."</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Phil and Mr. James gaze at one another along this strip as if
the megawatt life strategist, becoming his own money mint by offering
folksy tough love to troubled souls who can't seem get it together,
and the fawning spiritual medium, who rings up profits chatting with
the dead, were somehow having a cozy sit-down of their own. If only
that were really possible.</LD>
<TE>   Well ... it is.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: Listen up, Jimbo, as I tell ya this will be a changin'
day in your life and offer facile homespun advice that you'd be a
naive idiot to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I nod my head and focus on a leprechaun that I claim
is standing on your shoulder after passing over in the 18th century.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I sit here grinnin' like a possum, fella, while
thinkin' you're a slug.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I fantasize a thunderbolt striking your chair while
throwing you my obsequious smile that I rehearse each morning in
front of a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: Which I would dearly love to wipe off your face with my
coonskin cap.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: But not before I mention the dead poodle wagging its
tail while sitting on your lap.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I wonder if ya sit home all day makin' this stuff up.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: A valid question I'll ignore while telling you that I'm
now being contacted by your great-great-grandfather about his passing
over. I'm getting something about a heart. A heart condition. Is that
right? Please?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I keep on grinnin' and inform you he didn't have a
heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Which I pretend not to hear while panicking and hoping
no one notices my terror and the trickle running down my leg.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: While I repeat, "No heart condition," and tell ya to
grow up and get past these problems, and that there's no rationale
for shootin' yourself in the foot.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I regain my poise and say that if his heart stopped
when he passed over, that's a heart condition to me.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: While I get real goofy and say listenin' to ya is like
tryin' to sack fog.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I play my eerie music, assure you that you're never
alone and begin speaking with the spirit of J. Edgar Hoover hovering
just above your head.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I sit on the edge of my chair as if I really care
what ya think, and say children come and go, they join your life, ya
don't join theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I make my voice crack with emotion in response to
your convoluted balderdash, sigh deeply to project deep feeling and
tell you "God bless," while praying your show is struck by a typhoon.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: While audience members nod knowingly as if they have a
clue about what either of us is sayin', and I pretend to know what I
mean when I say ya gotta do a relationship autopsy and get closure
from where ya been before ya go on to the next thing.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Doubletalk that moves me to tears as I fantasize
performing an autopsy on you.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I ask why ya talkin' to the dead when ya gotta get
balance in your life, and add that there's no reality, only
perception, and if ya don't fix that perception, you're doomed before
ya start.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Which I'll pretend makes sense before mentioning the
contact I'm now having with an ancient Babylonian who says he's your
cousin many times removed and wants me to tell you he liked you
better on "Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I wonder if you're takin' stupid to a higher art form
and tell you happiness is a choice.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Which gives me time to call my stockbroker and check
the market.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I tell you pretty soon you're gonna up and say, whoa,
I got old.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Not as old as the prehistoric mummy I contend is
standing behind you, wiggling his ears and wanting to tell you
there's a real outpouring of love for you from your ancestors on the
other side. What's that, mummy? Uh huh. I gotcha.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: Which is why I say you're not going to convince me it's
reasonable that ya talk to the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Which I ignore while lifting my eyes to connect to the
spirit, who keeps saying in my ear she's sorry she had to go.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: While I ask, "Do ya guys just get together and start
doggin' on each other?"</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: As I try to keep a straight face while telling you I'm
hearing stories from heaven and that Lizzie Borden wants to say hi.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phil: As I tell ya what a good spirit you've been here today
and that talkin' to the dead beats talkin' to most of the guests on
my show.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. James: Which I would respond to tearfully, with sincere
appreciation, were I not taking a call on my cell phone from my
agent.</TE>

<HD>An American scrapbook</HD>
<DH>David Hume Kennerly set out to capture the changing face of
U.S. society by taking a photo a day in 2000. The results of his
quest are at the Smithsonian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eddy Ramirez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington</LD>
<LD>   Prominently displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and
Industrial Building is an enlarged black-and-white photograph of an
ad for a drive-in movie theater in Baker, Idaho: two giant smiling
potatoes on the back of an old Chevy pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   Like others on display there, the photograph is a humorous
snapshot and -- in the words of Pulitzer Prize-winning
photojournalist David Hume Kennerly -- a reflection of what America
was in contrast to the rest of the world at the turn of the 21st
century.</LD>
<TE>   "They capture a different place, a different time," Kennerly said
earlier this month at the opening of his photo exhibition titled
"Photo du Jour: A Picture-a-Day Journey Through the First Year of the
New Millennium."</TE>
<TE>   Kennerly, 55, has covered eight presidential campaigns and shot 35
covers for Time and Newsweek. His early photographs captured some of
the most searing images of the Vietnam War, winning him the 1972
Pulitzer.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, however, he took on a decidedly different project. That
year he traveled across 38 states and seven countries, taking
black-and-white pictures that are in turn amusing, breathtaking, in
some cases even mundane. Although the idea came as a whim, he said,
the goal was to record life and culture around the world, especially
in America, so later generations would always have a sense of where
they came from.</TE>
<TE>   Using a 43-millimeter single-lens camera, Kennerly photographed
ordinary people, including his own children at his Santa Monica home,
as well as world events such as Bill Clinton's unprecedented visit to
Vietnam. Mostly, the photos show vistas of rural and urban America,
all leading up to the drama of the presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Kennerly traveled more than 250,000 miles, shooting a photograph
each day. Though he jokingly refers to the collection as "a scrapbook
of my wanderings," Kennerly is quick to point out that since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, his photographs have gained more meaning.</TE>
<TE>   One of Kennerly's favorite photographs shows a desolate parking
lot in South Carolina. No people. Only corporate logos. Holiday Inn,
Exxon, Pizza Hut, Econo Lodge, the Waffle House. The focal point is a
sign on a utility pole advertising a traveling circus.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows what's wrong with America," he said, noting the irony of
the sign. He points to another favorite -- a shot of a Macon, Ga.,
auto shop called "Love of Christ Detail Shop." Sounding defeated, he
said: "With all these franchises going up, I doubt we'll see these
kinds of places much longer."</TE>
<TE>   In an eerie way, he said, certain photographs that seemed void of
much meaning before Sept. 11 now speak volumes about how much life
has changed. On Jan. 2, 2000, Kennerly captured a distant shot of the
U.S. Capitol from behind a steel fence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the same place anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennerly was the White House photographer for President Gerald
Ford after returning from Southeast Asia in 1974. He had unrestricted
access to shoot Cabinet meetings with Ford and several of the major
political players serving in the current Bush administration. "It was
a different world then," he said. "I've seen it change so much."</TE>
<TE>   But not every photograph in his collection bears witness to a
distant past.</TE>
<TE>   One picture captures the splendor of Santa Monica's palm trees.
The streets of New York City and Washington, D.C., are shown bustling
with people and traffic."I never missed a day," Kennerly said.</TE>
<TE>   He came close in early July, though. Unable to leave his bed after
knee surgery, he made a last-minute decision to photograph his two
younger sons, Nick and Jack, shown standing at his bedside, staring
at his leg. In the following days, he shot the sunset reflected on
his bedroom window, even a fern in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was this obsessive drive of mine," he said, laughing. "I would
wake up in the morning and didn't know where I was going to end up at
the end of the day."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential election would mark the end of his yearlong
journey in a dramatic way, he said. He covered Republican Arizona
Sen. John McCain's bid for the presidency until McCain announced the
end of his quest in Sedona, which provided one of the exhibition's
most stunning panoramic photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on election night, he shot what he considers the most
striking political photograph of his career. Staring transfixed at
the television, George W. and Laura Bush anxiously await the results
on election night. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush stands behind them looking
on in disbelief as news of a tie is declared.</TE>
<TE>   Former President George H.W. Bush is in the background attending
to a telephone call while all the Cheneys can do is listen in. "The
whole thing was like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride," Kennerly recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important body of work with interesting perspectives
from someone who's so tightly focused on photojournalism," said
Michelle Delaney, exhibition curator and collections manager at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. "For [Kennerly] to
take a step back from his daily routine and point his camera in
different directions was really an interesting concept."</TE>
<TE>   Delaney, who had worked with Kennerly, arranged to bring the show
to the Smithsonian, where it will be until Dec. 29. It coincides with
the release of Kennerly's book, also titled "Photo du Jour," which
features 515 photographed images.</TE>

<LD>Most Hollywood movies are works of fiction, but what if the
screenwriters credited with creating them are fictional as well?</LD>
<LD>   In Jonathan Demme's new film, "The Truth About Charlie," which
debuts Friday) with a cast that includes Mark Wahlberg and Thandie
Newton, one of the screenwriters listed in the credits is Peter
Joshua. Sound familiar? It does if you recall that in Stanley Donen's
1963 romantic thriller "Charade," on which Demme's movie is based,
one of Cary Grant's identities is Peter Joshua.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, the Peter Joshua credited with Demme, Steve Schmidt
and Jessica Bendinger with writing "The Truth About Charlie" is none
other than Peter Stone, who wrote "Charade." Why the fictional name?</LD>
<TE>   "Since Peter Stone didn't do any work on this adaptation, he, in
deference to Jonathan Demme and the other writers, took the name
Peter Joshua as a nod to the character in the original movie,"
explains a spokeswoman for Universal Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is replete with films in which fictional names are
listed in the credits, from W.C. Fields, who wrote under such
colorful pseudonyms as Mahatma Kane Jeeves and Otis J. Criblecoblis,
to Robert Towne, who reportedly was so dissatisfied with the movie
that he used the name of his sheepdog, P.H. Vazak, on "Greystoke: The
Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes." In "Adaptation," which debuts
Dec. 6, Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman are listed as the
screenwriters, although Donald does not exist.</TE>
<TE>   And how does the Writers Guild of America feel about this?</TE>
<TE>   "The right of writers to pick a pseudonym is embraced in the
guild's contract" with the studios, a WGA spokeswoman said, but "the
studios usually try to curtail it."</TE>

<LD>Scan the Billboard sales chart and you'll see albums by Elvis
Presley, the Rolling Stones and Tom Petty in the Top 10. Keep going
and you'll find others by James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Queen,
Chicago, Rod Stewart, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Linda Ronstadt.
On Tuesday, the arrival of Santana's new album in stores will quickly
add another time-honored name to that list.</LD>
<LD>   The proliferation of hit albums from veteran acts marks a dramatic
turnaround from the not-so-distant past, when the surging teen-pop
wave defined "veteran" as anyone old enough to drive.</LD>
<LD>   It also reflects a new appreciation for the over-35 consumer by
record companies that have long focused their attention on the youth
crowd.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think they're throwing in the towel on younger
audiences," says Tower Records Southwest region director Bob Feterl,
"but the labels have realized that they'd better broaden their
horizons, because anyone who puts all their eggs in that youth basket
is in big trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer young fans are rushing out to buy CDs, not only because of
the loss of steam in teen pop, but also because there's so much music
on the Internet they can download for free.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder sales and marketing executives suddenly see older
listeners as an untapped resource.</TE>
<TE>   "It falls in line with a comment I heard from a copyright attorney
at a panel on the digital world and illicit copying," says Billboard
charts editor Geoff Mayfield. "He made the point that there are
people in the world who are too busy to download, and these are
called people with jobs. The industry is starting to see some of the
wisdom of that thought."</TE>
<TE>   That's led to a bonanza for many established acts. Taylor, Barry
Manilow, Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, and country acts the Dixie
Chicks and Toby Keith have posted their highest single-week sales
since SoundScan began measuring actual sales in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's been so worried about how to get younger buyers into
stores," Mayfield says. "They're discovering that their parents,
aunts and uncles are still willing to go."</TE>

<HD>No retraction here</HD>
<DH>Harry Belafonte won't retreat from remarks calling Bush
officials 'house slaves.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Belafonte is not backing down. He says his recent incendiary
comments about Secretary of State Colin Powell on a San Diego radio
talk show were "metaphorically, probably even more accurate than I
suspected. The extent to which people have responded, both pro and
con," he says, demonstrates the country's great unmet need for
healthy debate on issues of "history, race and economic oppression."</LD>
<LD>   Belafonte sounded almost gallant in a phone interview from his New
York office, accepting his role as lightning rod -- a respected
public figure and recipient of many human rights awards who opened
channels for a pent-up populace to sound off on subjects they
generally don't have a chance to tackle.</LD>
<LD>   Slavery, for example. It is not your usual talk-show fodder. It is
too complex, emotion-charged, and, for many, too antique a subject.
Belafonte, 75, opened that floodgate when he used Civil War-era
language, likening Powell and, later, National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice to "house slaves" who must do the bidding of their
"master," meaning President Bush, or be kicked back out in the
fields.</LD>
<TE>   Those words traveled around the world, eliciting a barrage of news
stories, editorials, TV and radio discussions, many of which
ridiculed Belafonte's use of the slavery analogy. Civil rights
leaders also took Belafonte to task even as some politicians began
distancing themselves from the singer, who has long been an outspoken
civil and human rights activist.</TE>
<TE>   Powell responded with a gracious dismissal on CNN's "Larry King
Live," calling Belafonte's slave reference "unfortunate" and "a
throwback to another time and another place."</TE>
<TE>   In a classic case of understatement, Belafonte admits that "to
some people, my words may have seemed extreme." But he says he has no
regrets, is not uncomfortable or embarrassed, and does not wish he
had chosen another analogy.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he is incensed by a letter he's just received from
Anti-Defamation League director Abraham Foxman, who requests that
Belafonte "refrain from references to slavery," no matter how the
entertainer-social reformer feels about positions espoused by Powell.
Slavery references "demean and degrade and contribute nothing
constructive to the serious and important policy debate in which our
nation is currently engaged," Foxman's letter states.</TE>
<TE>   Belafonte's outrage leaps through the phone:</TE>
<TE>   "Why are references to slavery demeaning? ... Slavery is an
important part of this nation's history. An absolutely critical part
of any analysis that is done in defining black Americans. Not only
the oppression and degradation of it. But our character, our courage,
our spirit, our language, our songs and our culture are all born in
that environment.</TE>
<TE>   "This nation has never really confronted, debated or had any fair
exchange on this issue of slavery. We went from the strict
confinement of physical slavery -- with chains, shackles and whips --
to the spiritual and psychological chains of slavery in the following
century of legal segregation in this country."</TE>
<TE>   George Holmes, executive director of the Congress of Racial
Equality, one of the nation's oldest civil rights groups, says he
respects Belafonte's right to make the comments he made on the radio.
"But I disagree with him, and I am embarrassed by those comments. We
cannot start name-calling simply because we disagree with someone."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes says the controversy is especially disturbing because up
until now, Belafonte's credentials have been "so impeccable. The guy
has a tremendous history, he stood next to Martin Luther King Jr. on
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for the 'I have a dream ...'
speech. He has spent his life fighting for human and civil rights,
for freedom of speech and association. For the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "That means a person has a choice to be Democrat or Republican. If
Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell choose to be Republicans, that does
not make them house slaves," Holmes says.</TE>
<TE>   Belafonte, who popularized calypso music with his "Banana Boat
Song (Day-O)" in 1957 and went on to explore a variety of musical
styles and film roles, sees it differently. He was not name-calling,
and it was not a personal attack on Powell, he maintains. He has
genuine political differences.</TE>
<TE>   "When somebody comes from the history I've just described, when
that somebody in our ranks is able to break through and acquire
positions of power and influence, our expectation is that this person
will serve and bring relief to people still trapped," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration is wrecking the economy, making people
unemployed and leading us into war," he says. "These are very
critical, serious issues. And Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell are
part of that. I expect them to take a stand. I expect everyone to
take a stand.... Even if it leads to them being fired," he says.
"That's my expectation of the human family."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Jackson, founder and president of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,
believes first reports in the media "seemed to make the attack more
personal than it was. Harry was not attacking a person. He was
attacking the side of history that person is on.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush represents anathema to our struggle for social justice. He
would not permit Powell to go to the UN conference on racism in South
Africa; he has sought to stock the courts with anti-civil rights
judges; he is anti-affirmative action; he has taken us from budget
surplus to budget deficit. We are simply on different teams," Jackson
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of it like this. If you're watching the Lakers and the
Bulls, you may admire Michael Jordan but you are rooting for the
other team."</TE>
<TE>   Belafonte, opposed to unilateral military action in Iraq, says
that "most of what's going on right now in the Middle East is all
about oil. That is the bottom-line truth." And that's how this whole
controversy got started, he says. Radio-show host Ted Leitner "asked
what I thought of Powell's apparent silence on his position toward
the war. I said he serves his master well. He asked me what I meant.
And I went into the metaphor of slavery. It was not meant as a
personal attack on Powell. I am tired of being told to leave politics
to the politicians. I believe politics is part of the civil order,
it's how democracy works." Belafonte says he has been swamped with
calls and letters from around the world since his remarks. "This has
gone much farther than I ever could have imagined. And I have no idea
how far it will continue to go."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Belafonte is scheduled to receive the 2002 Bishop
Walker Humanitarian Award "for outstanding contributions to
humankind" at an event to be held by Africare, a nonprofit African
relief group. Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) is listed
on the dinner invitation as a patron of the event, along with Senate
Majority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Africare President Julius Coles confirmed late last week that Lott
"has advised us he will not attend the event. Before all this
happened both Lott and Daschle had graciously consented to be
honorary co-chairs. We have not heard from Sen. Daschle."</TE>
<TE>   Belafonte says he doesn't care whether people are for or against
his position, as long as they are spurred to do some serious thinking
about issues he has raised. That seems to be happening.</TE>
<TE>   An article in the Baltimore Sun said that "if there is a
plantation here, it's the one Belafonte is on: where all blacks are
supposed to act, think and vote a certain way." A Boston Herald
editorial says Belafonte is "still trapped in another time and
place..." and it is "a little sickening that he cannot realize that
all black Americans are free to make up their minds."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Sun-Times called for Belafonte to apologize, and Bill
O'Reilly, of Fox News Network's "The O'Reilly Factor," called
Belafonte "despicable."</TE>

<HD>'Ring' lands in winner's circle</HD>
<DH>The thriller grabs the No. 1 spot, with 'Sweet Home
Alabama' nestled in second place.</DH>

<LD>Naomi Watts' star turn in a remake of a Japanese thriller, "The
Ring," spooked its way into the No. 1 spot this weekend, while Reese
Witherspoon's "Sweet Home Alabama" hung onto second place for the
third weekend in a row, according to studio box-office estimates.</LD>
<LD>   "The Ring," which was released on 1,981 screens nationwide,
grossed an estimated $15 million, taking in about $7,572 per screen.
British-born Watts broke out with last year's bizarre but critically
lauded David Lynch film "Mulholland Drive."</LD>
<LD>   In its fourth weekend, "Sweet Home" is Witherspoon's biggest
box-office hit, bringing in an estimated $9.6 million over the
weekend, dropping a respectable 33% from last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The film has grossed about $99 million, landing Witherspoon among
a select few female actors who can open a studio movie.</TE>
<TE>   Hannibal Lecter and "Red Dragon" sank from first to third place
with an estimated $8.8 million, dropping 50% from the prior weekend,
for a three-weekend total of $77.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The film is underperforming compared with "Hannibal," despite
being better received among critics.</TE>
<TE>   "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," the most successful independent film
of all time, edged up a notch to No. 4, grossing $7.1 million over
the weekend for a whopping $169.3-million gross since its May
release. The lighthearted romantic comedy "Brown Sugar" slipped to
No. 5, grossing an estimated $5.3 million. The film, starring Sanaa
Lathan and Taye Diggs, has brought in $18.1 million in 10 days.
Stephen Gaghan's directorial debut, "Abandon," tied with "Brown
Sugar" at No. 5, also bringing in $5.3 million in its first weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Though director Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love" may not
be in the top 10, it averaged an impressive $20,897 per screen on
only 78 screens in select cities. In two weekends, the movie has
grossed $2.2 million. The film's distributor, Columbia Pictures,
plans to add at least 400 screens by next weekend and to roll it out
by Nov. 1 to a national release in more than 1,000 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which has garnered critical acclaim for Anderson --
winner of the best director prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival
-- is an odd romantic comedy starring an unlikely pair: Emily Watson,
known more for her intense dramatic performances in such films as
"Hilary and Jackie," and America's leading goofball, Adam Sandler.</TE>
<TE>   Revolution Studios, which produced the film and created the
marketing strategy, knew the film had to be sold as an "auteur" work,
attracting audiences based on solid reviews and the director's
reputation. "We were not trying to fool anybody by selling it as an
Adam Sandler movie," said Revolution partner Tom Sherak.</TE>
<TE>   Among other limited releases, "Bowling for Columbine," Michael
Moore's pointed documentary about the U.S. gun culture, also
performed solidly, averaging $16,799 per theater in 46 locations in a
dozen cities. In sixth place was "The Transporter," grossing $5
million for a total of $17 million. At No. 7 was the animated film
"Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie," bringing in $4.1 million. .</TE>

<HD>Museum campaign heats up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Nov. 5 election approaching, backers of a county bond issue
for cultural facilities are stepping up their campaign, but they face
a daunting level of support needed for approval, and opponents claim
that the measure's stated intent is misleading.</LD>
<LD>   The supporters of Los Angeles County Measure A, a proposed bond
issue of $250 million to pay for major upgrades at the county's art
and natural history museums and new construction at a handful of
other cultural institutions, have stepped up their efforts in the
last week with a round of TV spots and plans for a mailer in coming
days.</LD>
<LD>   In their arguments, the measure's supporters have stressed the
protection from earthquake and fires that the construction will
bring, and compiled a long list of endorsements from school, city,
county, state and federal officials. Opponents, who as of Sept. 30
hadn't spent a dime, assert in recently released ballot arguments
that the bond issue amounts to "a blank check" for arts organizations
that has more to do with institutional ambition than visitor safety.</LD>
<TE>   The measure's backers are led by top officials and contributors to
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Natural History Museum
of Los Angeles County, who together have put more than $1 million
into the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Each museum is in the early stages of dramatic renovation plans,
with costs at each expected to reach $300 million. They and their
allies in support of Measure A, however, face several challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest is the number of votes it will take to win.
Because the bond issue would be paid for by a boost in property
taxes, the measure needs to win two-thirds of the votes cast -- a
target that most ballot initiatives failed to reach in the last round
of county and state elections.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, placed on the ballot by the county Board of
Supervisors, calls for a $250-million bond issue, to be paid off in
30 years. In its first year, the property-tax boost would amount to
$6.96 per year for the owner of a $250,000 home, with the bite
steadily declining over the next 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   The money would be spread among several building projects, but the
lion's share, $196 million, would be divided between LACMA and the
Natural History Museum. The measure's backers have attached a
matching-fund requirement to the bond, mandating that taxpayer
dollars will only be passed along to the museums if the institutions
separately raise roughly $1.15 in private funds for every public
dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, to qualify for its $98 million, each museum needs to
privately raise $112.5 million between now and November 2012. The
measure calls for the bond money to be limited to "seismic, fire and
life safety, and associated work" and overseen by an advisory
committee appointed by the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining $54 million would be shared among half a dozen
county-sponsored projects, including $15 million toward a new
performing arts complex at Cal State Northridge, $15 million toward
creation of a cultural arts complex on county property in the El
Pueblo de Los Angeles historic district in downtown Los Angeles; and
$8 million for a new performing arts center in the San Gabriel
Valley. Some of those projects, including the Northridge proposal,
require matching funds; others, like the downtown historic district,
do not.</TE>
<TE>   Though top officials at the art and natural history museums expect
private contributions to pay for most of their renovations, they say
planning and cost estimates remain at an early stage, and neither
expects to announce any donors or amounts until months after the
election.</TE>
<TE>   Without a bond issue, said Jane Pisano, director of the Natural
History Museum, "we're going to have to look for other sources of
public funding.... I really believe that there needs to be some
public money in this project. If we're looking now at a $300-million
project, having the public piece of it being one-third strikes me as
reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have labeled Measure A an "earthquake and fire
safety bond" and to underline the emphasis on safety, the measure's
supporters have enlisted Caltech seismologist Dr. Kate Hutton to join
the city and county fire chiefs and a former Federal Emergency
Management Agency official in the ballot arguments in favor of the
bond issue. The television spots open with images of 1994 earthquake
destruction in the San Fernando Valley, then cut to the Natural
History Museum and later feature Caltech's seismology lab director
Don Helmberger.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's backers point out that the Natural History Museum's
main Exposition Park building, much of which dates to 1913, "does not
meet today's strict earthquake and fire safety standards." Measure A,
their ballot argument says, "will protect children and adults from
earthquake and fire hazards at this and other aging science and
cultural facilities."</TE>
<TE>   This is where skeptics step in. The measure's opponents, who
include Ted Brown, chairman of the Libertarian Party in the
Glendale/Pasadena region; and John Coupal, president of the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., argue that the bond issue is more than simply
a safety measure, because it earmarks money not just for upgrading of
existing buildings, but construction of new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Natural History Museum's oldest portions date back 89
years (with additions in the 1920s, '30s, '60s and '70s), the
institution remains open, serving thousands of visitors weekly
without any special restrictions from fire or building officials.</TE>
<TE>   At LACMA, also open and unrestricted, the oldest buildings in the
museum's central complex date to the mid-1960s, which makes them
newer than most residences in Los Angeles County (according to the
2000 census), and newer than the 1960 county administration building
in downtown Los Angeles, as well. The LACMA complex was also the
subject of a major renovation in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of LACMA's capital improvement plan, unveiled in
December, is Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas' proposal to level the
LACMA complex's four central buildings and build anew a reorganized
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of making a few needed renovations, the museum board
elected to hire an avant-garde designer and totally raze the existing
buildings," assert Brown, Coupal and company in their ballot argument
against the measure. "Some would call this excessive, while others
might say the new design is a dramatic way to house the county's
premier artworks. But taxpayers should not pay in any event."</TE>
<TE>   LACMA spokesman Jim Rawitsch dismissed those objections, stressing
the safety angle: "The language of the bond issue is explicit....
This is a problem that's been waiting to be solved."</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that under the proposed bond, both museums are
required to increase their free admissions to children and free tours
to school groups by 50% over 2001-02 levels.</TE>
<TE>   County registrar's records show that Citizens for Earthquake and
Fire Safety, the principal group boosting Measure A, took in $1.18
million in contributions through Sept. 30 and spent $250,693.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest backers: Museum Associates (the private,
nonprofit group associated with LACMA) has given $950,000; the L.A.
County Museum of Natural History Foundation has given $200,000;
developer and philanthropist Donald Bren of Newport Beach has given
$25,000; and the Friends of Zev Yaroslavsky, the county supervisor
who has worked most closely with the museums on the measure, made a
loan of $2,000 to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Through Sept. 30, the spending included about $152,000 on
political consulting by Santa Monica-based Winner &amp; Mandabach
Campaigns and $95,000 on polling by Santa Monica-based Fairbank,
Maslin, Maullin &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign consultant Jorge Flores, of Winner &amp; Mandabach, declined
to estimate what total campaign spending would be but said the
pro-Measure A campaign began airing television spots Oct. 14, on
network affiliates and cable channels. Mailings to "high propensity"
voters countywide are planned for the last 10 days of campaign,
Flores said.</TE>

<HD>Cullberg Ballet brings whimsy, sophistication to 'Swan
Lake'</HD>
<DH>Stockholm troupe adds contemporary insight to the
choreography of Mats Ek, known for blending classical and modern
movements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the stage of Royce Hall, the last notes of Tchaikovsky's "Swan
Lake" have sounded. A triumphant Prince Siegfried has led the pure,
spiritual, white-tutued swan queen Odette into the wings, her
impossibly long wedding veil trailing behind as a bridal train -- and
the sorcerer Von Rothbart carrying the end of it.</LD>
<LD>   Happy ending, right? Not exactly, not yet, for suddenly, in
silence, Siegfried backs onto the stage as if recoiling from a
terrible mistake. Just as unexpectedly, the carnal Odile -- a.k.a.
the black swan -- materializes from under Marie-Louise Ekman's
abstract lake backdrop and beckons him with a come-hither gesture. As
the curtain falls, hither he comes, not smiling but no longer
deluding himself about who he is and what he needs.</LD>
<LD>   And that's the wild, wise, whimsical 1987 "Swan Lake" created by
Swedish choreographer Mats Ek, as danced at UCLA on Friday by
Stockholm's exciting Cullberg Ballet in its local debut. The contours
of the mythic tale remain familiar in Ek's retelling, but there's
more story, more contemporary implications within the story -- and
more steps. Not always classical steps, of course, for Ek is famed
for splicing stretched ballet moves (especially jumps) to intricate,
convulsive torso shudders from the world of modern dance.</LD>
<TE>   Ek also likes to embed realistic gesture in complex, full-body
actions: for example, the sycophantic courtiers sawing away at
imaginary violins as they dance, or the swans waddling like
bottom-heavy geese before they soar into flight. Thus, the dancing is
likely to couple an emblematic or even childlike basic image with a
wealth of movement detail.</TE>
<TE>   Quite apart from Ek's narrative innovations, this choreographic
style suggests an intuitive, technically sophisticated and supremely
fresh post-Balanchine approach to Tchaikovsky dancing. Bare-legged
and barefoot under white tutus -- and bald as well -- the men and
women of the Cullberg swan corps would never be mistaken for
conventional balletic waterfowl. But the way they catch the surge and
lift of the music persuades you that Ek's version is no joke.</TE>
<TE>   As in traditional stagings, Ek's Siegfried is troubled by an
overbearing mother (Carolin Geiger), here literally a scarlet woman
linked in one startling transformation to the swan-oppressor Von
Rothbart (Luiz Fernando Martins). In addition, Ek uses the Act 3
national dances (normally just a splashy diversion) to accompany
episodes in Siegfried's journey of self-discovery as he searches for
his lost Odette. The Russian and Spanish segments teach him how not
to treat women; however, an Israeli duet (to Jewish folk music)
represents inexplicable Ek whimsy.</TE>
<TE>   You could argue that since Siegfried doesn't confuse Odile with
Odette in Ek's version, there's no reason for them to be portrayed by
the same dancer -- and, perhaps, like the tutus, this double casting
merely represents a reference to the classical traditions being
reconsidered here. But as performed with exemplary security by Yamit
Kalef, they're birds of a feather anyway, and what you watch is how
beautifully Kalef carves space.</TE>
<TE>   As Ek's rebellious antihero, Christopher Akrill delivers all the
quirky bowing, twitching and foot pounding as if to the manner born,
but then takes to the air like a Bolshoi power jumper. And it doesn't
hurt that he looks like a teenage hip-hop dancer who wandered into
the wrong studio.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Friday audience received only an alphabetical
list of dancers so never learned who performed what role (though UCLA
reps promised that a casting sheet would be provided Saturday).</TE>
<TE>   Also uncredited: the authoritative recording conducted by Gennadi
Rozhdestvensky that underpinned the performance. Though Ek made
substantial cuts, he left the music in its original order, so
audiences accustomed to the standard, resequenced score adopted by
other companies found familiar tunes in unfamiliar places.</TE>
<TE>   Re-imagining a classic can be a way back (to Tchaikovsky's
original intentions) as well as a way forward (toward a movement
idiom incorporating nearly all the disciplines of Western theater
dance). By no means the most radical of Ek's ballet remakes, his
"Swan Lake" has the immediacy of a new work, the reflected glory of
an antique heirloom, plus the passion and prowess that a world-class
company can bestow.</TE>

<HD>Unanswered questions make for choppy 'Water'</HD>
<DH>Play is sinewy, stripped down but plagued by credibility
gaps.</DH>

<LD>An affair breaks up two marriages in "Orange Flower Water," the
second production of the new LA Stage &amp; Film, at Gascon Center
Theatre in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Wright's play is set in the small town of Pine City, Minn.,
and it's a small play -- a 75-minute series of monologues and
duologues that leave a few basic questions unanswered about its
characters.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that was part of Wright's strategy. He probably realized
that his subject and the name Pine City sound as if they're straight
out of a TV soap opera. To mitigate that impression, he rejected the
repetitious underlining of soap opera writing and chose to present a
more distilled glimpse of these events.</LD>
<TE>   We move immediately from an initial monologue by Cathy (Roxanne
Hart), who's apparently unaware that anything is amiss in her
marriage, to a scene in which her husband, David (Michael Mantell),
attempts to convince the hesitant Beth (Terry Urdang) of his love.</TE>
<TE>   Then we meet Beth's boorish husband, Brad (Brian Cousins), who's
much more suspicious of his mate than Cathy is of hers. Brad's also
more distraught about subsequent events.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the women are made of much stronger emotional fiber than
the men. If a woman had written the play, she might be suspected of
male-bashing.</TE>
<TE>   The scenes are presented with a fine sheen by director Meryl
Friedman. All the actors remain on stage throughout. The ones who
aren't directly involved in a scene linger in the background and
occasionally glance meaningfully at the actors who are front and
center, accompanied by the accent marks of Dan Weingarten's lighting.</TE>
<TE>   The sexiest scene is shared not by the illicit lovers but by the
erstwhile marrieds David and Cathy. Although the actors remain
clothed and facing the audience, Wright's dialogue takes them through
a farewell bedroom encounter that serves as a brief tour de force for
the writer and the actors.</TE>
<TE>   It's so convincing that it renews the question of why these two
are splitting up -- a question that's never satisfactorily answered.
The play's surprisingly upbeat and slightly sappy resolution isn't
very credible, either.</TE>

<LD>The idea</LD>
<LD>   came to Sabina during lunch hour at school. She was sitting with
her best friend, Rachel. They were talking about Sabina's birthday
party the next week. She had invited seven girls, and they were going
to go bowling and have cake and ice cream at her house afterward.</LD>
<LD>   "So what do you want for your birthday?," Rachel asked.</LD>
<TE>   Sabina thought a moment. A few years ago she would have said "a
new Beanie Baby" or "a box of beads and string to make necklaces and
bracelets for my friends." Now that she would be 10, she mostly liked
CDs and books, not the picture books and easy-to-read books that
crowded the shelves in her room but long, interesting books.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what?," Sabina said, holding her pizza slice close to
her mouth and staring into the distance. "I just had an idea."</TE>
<TE>   "Uh oh!," Rachel said. "You're not going to make us be
butterflies, like last year, and make us fly around the playground so
everyone laughs?"</TE>
<TE>   "That was kind of dorky," Sabina said, grinning, "but no." She bit
into the pizza, then wiped the cheese from her lips. "I saw an ad. It
said a lot of schools really need books, especially for kindergarten
through third grade. A book publisher has offered to donate a new
book for each book that people bring in."</TE>
<TE>   "So?"</TE>
<TE>   "I bet a lot of kids at our school have books they don't read
anymore. You know, like 'Goodnight Moon' or 'The Little Engine That
Could.' Or ... "</TE>
<TE>   " 'Ig Lives in a Cave'! Whenever my mother read that book to me,
I'd be the dinosaur and growl, 'Mine!' when Ig said the berries were
his ..."</TE>
<TE>   "Right!"</TE>
<TE>   "So, like, what's your idea?"</TE>
<TE>   "What if we had a book drive? Ask kids to donate new or used
books. Tell them for each book they bring in, a publisher will send a
new book."</TE>
<TE>   "And give them to kids who don't get many books?" Rachel asked.
"That would be a fun project! But how do we go about it?"</TE>
<TE>   "That's something we'll have to figure out!" Sabina said.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: "At the Park"</TE>

<HD>Western Lit panel focuses on the inner cowpoke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sensitive cowboy is not a newsworthy item, but the sensitive
academician of western literature may well be. Gender studies in the
land of John Wayne and Natty Bumpo have always presented some
interesting challenges to hearty academics. There are the Willa
Cather disciples. And there is the Wallace Stegner camp. And the two
forces rarely converge, until this year.</LD>
<LD>   The 37th annual Western Literature Assn. Conference was held
recently in Tucson, and as dry as that sounds, it's an academic group
close-knit enough to share tequila drinking and salsa dancing and
late-night conversations over questions like, "Which famous character
in western fiction would you most like to sleep with?" Such evenings
are needed to provide some relief from daytime panels titled "Class,
Capitalism and Cather," "Ecovision and Narrative" and
"Countertextualizing Cultural Studies in the Southwest Borderlands."</LD>
<LD>   But something snapped this year: Suddenly, these tall,
stoop-shouldered academics in short sleeves (the West's equivalent of
Ivy League elbow patches) were doing something called "personal
narrative" to introduce their literary analysis. Stories of "My
father and how I came to study Zane Grey" predominated over
slogan-slinging and "issues of influence."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, at an early-morning panel on "Revising Models of
Masculinity in the Old and New West," three of the four male
panelists told stories of growing up with fathers who imposed a rigid
emotional torpor on their families.</TE>
<TE>   "After my mother's funeral," said professor David Fenimore from
the University of Nevada, Reno, "my brothers and I went to a sports
bar." He was visibly moved by this confession, and so was his
audience. This kind of honesty at an academic conference where,
normally, nothing moves, including the hotel air, can be refreshing.
Fenimore's paper, "The Sensitive Nurturing Gender-Bent Gunfighter in
Zane Grey's 'Mysterious Rider,' " analyzed not only Fenimore's own
childhood but also Grey's and its effect on his views of masculinity.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest Robinson, a Stegner scholar from UC Santa Cruz and about
as stern-looking a professor as you would never want to meet on a
weekend night out, began his lecture by saying, "I was a crybaby,
full of self-contempt." A spanking from his father left him "dreaming
murder." His recent work looks at Stegner's role as a parent, in his
life and his fiction. He points often to Stegner's "emotional
incapacity" and the author's own admission thereof.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone rejoiced in the triumph of personal-as-political.
Susan Rosowski, who runs a Cather Studies Center at the University of
Nebraska, resented the burden of personal "theater" on the text. "It
creates a kind of self-consciousness that leads to highly selective
reading."</TE>
<TE>   Others found it refreshing, particularly among the male academics.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to hear how I looked at the ocean and thought of my
mother, but some of us think that there is a place for personal
stories," Fenimore said. "If only to liven things up."</TE>

<CX>   Western literature -- An article in the Oct. 21 Calendar about the
Western Literature Assn. Conference incorrectly characterized the
source of a quote. UC Santa Cruz professor Forrest Robinson was not
referring to himself but rather was quoting writer Wallace Stegner
when he said, "I was a crybaby, full of self-contempt," and when he
said a spanking from his father left him "dreaming murder."</CX>

<HD>A composition for the ages?</HD>
<DH>Osvaldo Golijov's take on St. Mark's Passion has all the
earmarks of a breakthrough work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Occasionally, over the last 50 years, a piece of music has come along
that both defined its time and paved the way for the future. Such a
list might acknowledge how John Cage's silent piece "4'33" " inspired
conceptual art, Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story" elevated the
Broadway musical, Luciano Berio's "Sinfonia" stimulated musical
postmodernism and the Philip Glass-Robert Wilson "Einstein on the
Beach" redefined opera.</LD>
<LD>   It may be too soon yet to tell whether Osvaldo Golijov's "La
pasion segun San Marcos" will stand in such company. But this
exuberant version of the St. Mark gospel certainly felt as though it
might at its premiere in Stuttgart, Germany, in the summer of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Heard again Saturday night at Segerstrom Hall as part of the
Ecletic Orange Festival, it felt all the more to be a breakthrough
work. Were it to get enough widespread exposure, it could well do for
the music of Latin America what Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred
Years of Solitude" did for its literature -- namely, make the rest of
the world aware of what it has been missing.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, in the few places besides Stuttgart that Golijov's
passion has thus far been performed -- Boston, Tanglewood, Caracas,
Chicago -- it has caused a sensation. Audiences leap to their feet,
hardly able to believe their ears, their eyes and their luck at
witnessing such an inspirational performance. Critics rave with
perhaps unprecedented unanimity. A live, little-publicized recording
of the Stuttgart premiere available on Hanssler Classic, a small
German label not widely distributed in this country, gets snapped up
whenever our local record chains bother to stock it.</TE>
<TE>   So great is the interest in this work that had a bomb dropped on
the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday there would be
few left in Los Angeles to run its major musical institutions.</TE>
<TE>   So, what is it about a "Passion According to St. Mark," written by
an Argentine Jew now living and teaching in the Boston area, that can
make the retelling of Christ's last days seem so original, so modern,
so meaningful, so relevant, so universal? The key to this work's
great sway over a listener is, I think, its authenticity and complete
lack of pretense. Golijov responds to Mark's narrative as both an
outsider and insider. As a Jew, he comes to the gospel fresh, but not
naive, having grown up in a Catholic country and having also lived in
Jerusalem, where he studied music. He responds to Mark's narrative
personally, using his native Spanish and the musical means of
expression that are natural for him. He also trusts some truly
remarkable performers.</TE>
<TE>   Golijov's Jesus is Latin, dark-skinned and a man of the people --
a harsh people who lived in harsh times. Golijov's resources roam
Latin music. Brass and the large percussion contingent riotously
evoke recent Cuban salsa, as well as the Tito Puente of the '50s.
Astor Piazzolla's accordion is on hand. The brilliant singers that
Golijov relies on in the Venezuelan chorus, the Schola Cantorum de
Caracas, seem to be masters of just about any style the composer
throws at them, from riveting ritual chanting to clapping out
flamenco rhythms to producing amazing sounds from deep in their
throats. This is a chorus alive to the moment that sways balletically
as it sings and dramatizes every note. Sextets of violins and cellos
are tender when they need to be, but they also produce compellingly
strange-sounding harmonics when something more unsettling is wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The narrative proceeds quickly, abruptly, without transitions.
There are no specific character roles for soloists or choir. We see
Jesus and Peter and Judas refracted through as many different voices
and movements as we do through the different musical styles. Deraldo
Ferreira -- a dancer and performer on the berimbau (a primitive
Brazilian musical bow with a gourd at the end) -- enacts Jesus as
fisherman, a young follower of Jesus in a white sheet, and his
tormentors in three awesomely graceful and acrobatic dances. Reynaldo
Gonzales Fernandez, a Cuban dancer, singer and percussionist, shows
the Sermon on the Mount as a street celebration. Marvelous Brazilian
jazz singer Luciana Souza is the other soloist, adding a dusky, bossa
nova character to all she sings, and no more movingly so as when she
ends the passion with, of all things, a Kaddish, sung in Aramaic.</TE>
<TE>   If this passion is all passion, expressed in drama and movement
and hot rhythms, it has a heart-wrenching, sorrowful center,
expressed in the tears and regret of Peter, through an iridescent
aria, "Colorless Moon." Golijov's gorgeous, time-stopping setting of
the poem by Rosalia de Castro has become a favorite of Dawn Upshaw,
and it was sung here with tremulous beauty by Samia Ibrahim.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Maria Guinand, the music director of the Schola
Cantorum. A Venezuelan Bach scholar, she is also a lot more. Hers is
some of the most exciting conducting I have witnessed in a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "La pasion segun San Marcos" provides wonderful new possibilities
for breaking down barriers between cultures (Keiichi Hashimoto, the
trumpet player, hot as any Cuban you will ever hear, is Japanese). It
offers similar possibilities for breaking down the barriers between
concert and dramatic presentation. It is an event, plain and simple,
and it will be with us for a long time.</TE>

<HD>The bald truth: A&amp;E's 'Uncut' is a hairy two-hour washout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Samantha Bonar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The average adult loses about 150 hairs a day, and if you watch
tonight's A&amp;E documentary, "Uncut: The True Story of Hair" (9-11
p.m.), you also will lose 120 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   This over-styled production tries hard to be perky but, like
Jackie Kennedy's bouffant, there's nothing of substance to hold it
together.</LD>
<LD>   Far from a definitive history, the show tells us virtually nothing
new or interesting about hair care or hairstyles, opting instead for
a lot of footage from vintage commercials and commentary from the
likes of Vanna White and Rick James. About as riveting as an hour
spent under the dryer at the hairdresser's. Or, in this case, two
hours.</LD>
<TE>   Using "Uncut" as a guide, one would think that there were no
hairstyles before 1950, when, in fact, some of the most fascinating
hairy tales predate the TV ads the filmmakers mined for material.
Such as the blond-obsessed ancient Romans' practice of kidnapping
German women to make wigs from their pale tresses or the outrageous,
towering hairstyles of the 18th century lady, which might include an
entire fruit basket or a square-rigged galleon.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, including such material would have required combing
through history books instead of just chatting with Joan Jett (who
says of "rock 'n' roll hair": "You know it when you see it").</TE>
<TE>   The show trots out such dull topics as big hair of the '80s,
mullets, afros, Farrah's wings. Not even the revolutionary bob gets a
mention. The only interesting tidbit was that some of Andy Warhol's
wigs were made from hair from a yak's butt. But that choice item did
not make up for the other 119 minutes I sat through when I could have
been doing something interesting, like washing my hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncut" deserves a brushoff.</TE>

<LD>It is a salute one sees from pickup trucks on country roads. His
baseball hat perched firmly on his head, the driver of the truck sees
another truck approaching. Then, just as the two trucks pass, the
driver lifts his fingers off the steering wheel for a brief second.
Perhaps he glances at the driver of the second truck to see his
fingers do the same; perhaps there will be a barely discernible nod.
Then, just as quickly, the eyes return to the road, the fingers again
grip the wheel, the salute completed.</LD>
<LD>   In this moment, two men have acknowledged each other. More
precisely, two workers have acknowledged each other for being
workers, laborers, craftsmen. They have acknowledged what it means to
work, earn a living, stay at a job, especially on those days when it
would be far more fun to fish or hang around the house fixing a back
deck or playing with a child.</LD>
<LD>   "You know that guy?" I ask my friend, straining to see whether a
company name appears on the side of the other man's pickup.</LD>
<TE>   "Nope."</TE>
<TE>   "Recognize the truck?"</TE>
<TE>   "Not really."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing more is said, although the ritual will be repeated within
minutes when yet another truck passes us.</TE>
<TE>   A small gesture, yet one that holds an entire democracy together.
One doesn't need to know what the other man does, where he works,
what he's good at, what he earns. It is all about respect for the
worker, for the sense of duty implied in any job and the competence
and training that jobs require.</TE>
<TE>   It is also about a man defining and judging himself in terms of
his work. Good and steady employment means good and steady spirit and
the right to hold oneself in some esteem. If there's no work, there's
no travel, no salute, no respect. Men are supposed to protect and
provide; both become difficult, if not unmanageable, without work.</TE>
<TE>   Men without work are often unable to salute themselves. Some find
it painful to salute those still working. It is understood that the
world of work carries with it a degree of competition. This the
worker accepts. But competition for these guys with the baseball hats
moves beyond fairness when worthy workers, healthy workers, competent
workers can't find jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of inequities, the injustices known to
every man who ever took a job. Perhaps the salute connotes a
recognition that we are all in this together, that my success
ultimately is yours and my failure brings you down as well. Perhaps
the salute is meant only for people of the same niche, the same
guild, the same class.</TE>
<TE>   Providers too have to be provided for -- or at least their efforts
honored, their careers and financial futures protected. They're
driving their own trucks, but if they don't keep an eye on the others
and the road, they may crash.</TE>
<TE>   This too is part of respect. Pure self-interest has nothing to do
with respect. It has to do with letting people find their own way,
letting people go, looking the other way when they pass.
Self-interest means letting the dogs eat the dogs. It means finding
ways to rationalize a lack of interest in anyone's life but one's
own, and worse, it means not being able to recognize that downsizing,
manipulating accounts, cooking books and thinking only of personal
gain will eventually destroy not just the life of a man and the soul
of his family but the entire culture.</TE>
<TE>   And what of women? They're driving and they're saluting too, so
the same goes for them.</TE>
<TE>   Like the men, women have to salute one another, especially during
a nasty moment in history when some powerful types, their rhetoric
notwithstanding, have lost their respect for all these pickup drivers
in their baseball hats and have chosen to ride more comfortably on
other roads.</TE>

<HD>Organic Foods' New Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Halweil and Bob Scowcroft</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The food labels that you will begin to see today in supermarkets
across the nation, signifying a new national standard for organic
foods, could mark the beginning of an era in which organic foods
migrate from the fringe to the mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   Dedicated consumers and enterprising farmers have propelled the
growth of organic farming in the United States. At a time when every
other sector of the food industry is stagnant, organic sales are
growing at more than 20% each year.</LD>
<LD>   Americans already purchase about $10 billion in organic foods
annually. While that is a small share of the total food market -- and
certified organic land still makes up less than 1% of our
agricultural space -- consumers who previously hesitated to buy
organic foods may be swayed by the new government seal of approval.
And with a growing market, even more farmers might consider
abandoning their pesticide sprayers and sacks of nitrate in favor of
going organic.</LD>
<TE>   Why is this important? Organic farming has the potential to
liberate consumers from many of the threats in our food system: meat
recalls, the unknown consequences of genetically engineered crops,
and agrochemical residues in drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of depending on the pesticides and fertilizers that now
taint our nation's waterways, organic farmers rely on understanding
the ecological processes in the fields: rotating crops to break pest
cycles and build the soil, encouraging beneficial insect populations
that gobble pests and combining livestock and crop production.</TE>
<TE>   In organic agriculture, farm animals have access to the outdoors
instead of being crammed into the warehouse-size metal boxes that now
define American meat production and that soil neighboring communities
with mountains of manure. The new standard forbids organic farmers
from routinely feeding antibiotics or growth hormones to livestock.
Last year, studies in the New England Journal of Medicine documented
that such routine use in chickens, pigs and cows spurs the growth of
resistant bacteria, which undermines the effectiveness of antibiotics
for human use.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers of organic food do not have to worry about unlabeled,
cloned animals being ground into their meat. Organic processing
standards also forbid food irradiation, in addition to a range of
preservatives and additives allowed into nonorganic products.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with nations in Europe, where organic farmers enjoy
widespread financial and technical support, the United States is
lagging. The $180-billion farm bill passed this year included only
$15 million for organic farming research and only $5 million to help
farmers cover the costs of certification.</TE>
<TE>   But the new labeling standard is a major step toward recognizing
that organic farming delivers benefits the public craves: cleaner air
and water and a safer food supply.</TE>

<HD>The Plight of 'Illegal Children'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's fall, and my husband and I have been encouraging -- no, coercing
-- our children to walk to school. It's good for them, but we worry
about their safety. So we walk them the first two blocks, across the
boulevard with the traffic light, and then they continue by
themselves down three blocks of tree-lined streets.</LD>
<LD>   I watch them shuffle along, the older one sometimes jabbing his
little brother, and the younger with his shoes deliberately and
stylishly untied. Untied shoelaces drive me crazy, but I know they
are one of the few areas of autonomy these kids manage to carve away
from the control of teachers and parents. For three blocks, they're
on their own.</LD>
<LD>   The differences between the childhoods of suburban, middle-class
children and those of the 48,000 youngsters from Central America and
Mexico who go north illegally on their own every year are rooted in
transformations brought about by immigration and globalization.</LD>
<TE>   It's no small irony that many of these children are riding trains
north. Many of the railroad tracks were laid by U.S. agribusiness in
its search for Mexican migrant farm workers. Labor recruiters went
directly to the border to hook Mexican workers, and when that wasn't
enough, they went to the heart of central-western Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1942 and 1964, the bracero program issued nearly 5 million
labor contracts for Mexican men to work in the United States, mostly
in agriculture. Many of these men got used to earning dollars, first
in farm work and then in other jobs in cities and suburbs, so they
stayed. Their U.S. employers got addicted to them, too, papers or no
papers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mexican braceros' wives didn't like the long family
separations, and soon these women sought to follow their husbands to
the United States. Today, hundreds of thousands of Central American
and Mexican immigrant women are living and working in the U.S., while
their children remain in their countries of origin. Our labor demand
for immigrant workers has expanded far beyond agriculture to just
about every sector of the economy, including manufacturing,
construction, retail and services.</TE>
<TE>   Paid domestic work -- the work of cleaning other people's houses
and caring for other people's children -- has grown tremendously, and
in many places the job has entered the global marketplace. It's
practically institutionalized as an immigrant woman's job. Caribbean,
Indian and Filipina women who migrate for domestic jobs in other
parts of the globe -- like their Mexican and Central American
counterparts in the U.S. -- leave their families and children behind.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers of these children become transnational mothers out of
necessity. When they leave their toddlers in the care of grandmothers
or aunts to come to the U.S., they're doing so because they want the
best for the kids. They're not migrating in search of a good time but
to buy their children milk, shoes and schooling. They suffer, as do
their children, who feel abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Family migration dramas centered on gender have been replaced by
generational struggles. Just as Mexican migrant wives sought to join
their husbands, so too Central American and Mexican kids seek to join
their mothers in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This is globalization from below. It's the legacy of the bracero
program, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central
American civil wars of the 1980s and our changing postindustrial
economy. Rather than leading to equilibrium, globalization has
intensified inequalities. Entire communities get shaken in these
seismic shifts, and even children take on dangerous journeys to seek
exploitative work in El Norte.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we can begin to imagine and strive for childhood, with its
promise of protection and affection, to become a human right. A new
amnesty-legalization program, and labor and family policies that
recognize we live in a global world, would go a long way to remedying
the problems faced by these transnational families. Maybe then,
"illegal child" will no longer be part of our vocabulary.</TE>

<HD>There Really Is a Monster Under the Bed -- Big Brother</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court will decide whether states can intrude into
our sex lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Texas, they like their barbecue hot, their oil sweet and their sex
straight. Of course, only one of these preferences is set by law:
sex.</LD>
<LD>   In a case now under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court, two
Texas men are challenging their criminal convictions for having
consensual sex in the home of one of them.</LD>
<LD>   The case could reverse a controversial 1986 Supreme Court decision
that upheld the right of states to dictate the way citizens engage in
consensual sex. Since then, 13 states have tried to regulate conduct
in the bedroom, creating a type of morals police now found in those
states and such like-minded jurisdictions as Iran.</LD>
<TE>   In September 1998, John Lawrence and Tyron Garner were in
Lawrence's Houston apartment when state police barged in.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently an acquaintance had called in a false report of an
armed intruder. The two men were arrested for violating the Texas'
"homosexual conduct" law.</TE>
<TE>   The acquaintance was given a 30-day jail sentence for making a
false report, and Lawrence and Garner were convicted of a criminal
misdemeanor and fined.</TE>
<TE>   Under its 28-year-old law, Texas bans sodomy only between same-sex
partners. It is one of four states that confine such morality crimes
to the prosecution of homosexuals. Nine other states prohibit certain
acts, including oral sex, by any consenting adult.</TE>
<TE>   There may be no greater intrusion of Big Brother into private
lives than the regulation of the way that adults make love. Yet the
local morals police can rely on the U.S. Supreme Court's infamous
1986 decision upholding a Georgia law that prohibits a variety of
sexual acts between any adults. Despite the fact that one study found
that more than 75% of adult Americans reported that they engaged in
such criminalized acts as oral sex, former Chief Justice Warren
Burger cited "Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards" and
"millennia of moral teachings" in his concurring opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The key swing vote in this 5-4 decision, Justice Lewis F. Powell,
later said he had voted the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are a host of more pressing issues for our
police, ranging from snipers to street crime. We hardly need cops
looking for unapproved forms of intimacy in our homes as if bedrooms
were sexual speed traps.</TE>
<TE>   And the problem with a morals police is determining whose morals
will be the template. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft does not even approve
of dancing. Yet, one would hope that Ashcroft, as someone who
professes to believe in limited government, would oppose such
governmental intrusion into the home. After all, the administration
is currently arguing for a constitutional right to gun ownership. It
would be curious if the handgun under the bed is the only thing
clearly protected in the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the post-Sept. 11 expansion of government surveillance
of citizens, there must remain some place that we can honestly and
safely call our own. Without such a protected space, we simply become
vehicles of the shifting interests and tastes of the state.</TE>
<TE>   This fight is not about homosexual rights. It is not even about
sex. It is about that most basic right described by Justice Louis D.
Brandeis: the right to be left alone.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, I care less about my neighbor adopting the sexual
habits of the Emperor Caligula than I do about my government adopting
his tyrannical habits.</TE>

<HD>A Good Deal for Imperial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imperial County officials are crying "water rape"--yes, those are the
words a county supervisor used after attending water trade
negotiations last week. They complain of being forced at metaphorical
gunpoint to surrender their water supplies. They talk of Los Angeles'
theft of Owens Valley water a century ago. They lament the idling of
rich farmland so the city folk can fill their swimming pools.</LD>
<LD>   These complaints have not a shred of reality behind them. The
tentative water trade forged last week between Imperial and urban San
Diego County is a good deal for both sides. Rather than hurting the
rich farming oasis in the southeastern California desert, it should
boost the Imperial County economy.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego County Water Authority has agreed to pay the
Imperial Irrigation District a base price of $258 an acre-foot for
water that costs the farmers $15.50 an acre-foot, roughly the amount
two families would consume in a year.</LD>
<TE>   As many as 30,000 of the 450,000 acres of farmland now irrigated
with Colorado River water would be temporarily fallowed each year.
Farmers dislike the idea, but the fallowing is voluntary and farmers
would be compensated for water saved.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial County suffers chronic unemployment of 20% or more, and
the fallowing could eliminate some jobs, for instance in farm-supply
businesses. But Imperial would collect $2 billion over the 75-year
life of the contract, plus $20 million specifically to ease any
economic losses. In return, Imperial would give up only 4% of its
Colorado River water supply, which could be offset with conservation
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, achieved in a last-ditch flurry of negotiations led by
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), saves enough water to
avert a federal cutoff of Colorado River water to urban Southern
California. It's a far cry from what happened in the Owens Valley,
where Los Angeles secretly bought up land for water rights early in
the 20th century. Imperial went into these negotiations with eyes
wide open and with plenty of legal savvy at its disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Ratification by the Imperial Irrigation District board is not
certain. If the board rejects the water transfer, Southern California
cities will bear the punishing brunt of mandatory federal cuts in the
state's use of Colorado River water. Imperial has told the cities
it's their problem. But federal officials have also raised the
prospect of trimming Imperial's allotment because the district wastes
water. If that happens, Imperial County will be out the water with no
money to show for it.</TE>

<HD>A Deadly Group Home</HD>
<DH>Federal aid is needed to help rid the state of those
facilities that abuse the mentally ill.</DH>

<LD>Far too often, poorly regulated board-and-care facilities mistreat
mentally ill people sent to live there. Five died this year alone
while they were residents of the perversely named San Gabriel House
of Independence. In a society with a conscience, ongoing reports of
group-home abuse must spur revolutionary reform.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout history, societies have abused and made scapegoats of
people labeled as crazy, mere misfits as well as the truly mentally
ill. By the mid-20th century, mental hospitals had become modern alms
houses filled with rebellious teens and old people with nowhere else
to go, along with people with serious mental illness--whom
psychiatrists too often lobotomized, forced into electroshock or
controlled with mind-numbing drugs.</LD>
<LD>   In 1967, California addressed the outrages (and the cash drain) by
passing the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which prohibited hospitals
from involuntarily treating people unless they were an imminent
danger to self or others. The late Assemblyman Frank Lanterman had
hoped that his law would protect basic civil liberties and give rise
to humane, largely unrestricted facilities for the mentally ill. His
model was Fountain House, a New York City group home started in the
1940s that offered job training, counseling and housing.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, state and local governments used the ideal of
"independent living" as an excuse to shirk their obligations to the
mentally ill. The fault wasn't theirs alone. When Congress
established the Medicaid program in 1965, it required states to
provide a host of medical services for hospitalized patients without
health insurance but specifically excluded payment for such services
if a patient's illness was mental. The seriously mentally ill were
left to grub for survival on the streets and in facilities such as
that deadly group home in San Gabriel, which Los Angeles County
inspectors recently condemned for subjecting residents to "utterly
deplorable and illegal" conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The patients had been sent there by one of the 48 hospitals in Los
Angeles County with the authority to involuntarily treat mentally ill
patients. Next week the Board of Supervisors, in a vote on whether to
terminate the mental health contract of the hospital that had
referred patients to the San Gabriel facility, has the opportunity to
put all hospitals on notice that they'll be held responsible for the
patients they send to group homes. Beyond that, the supervisors need
to expand the county's team of inspectors, then use it to shut down
illegal group homes and more aggressively scrutinize those with
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   But the only way for this cash-strapped county to spur the sort of
reform that can begin to end the mental health crisis is to get the
federal government to finally pay its share. Fortunately, President
Bush's New Freedom Mental Health Commission holds its first public
meeting in Los Angeles from Nov. 12 to 14. The president said he
created the commission to "close cracks in the mental health system."</TE>
<TE>   Three decades after the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act triggered
disaster, this commission needs to push for a major policy change.
Diseases such as schizophrenia and major depression deserve the same
assistance from Medicaid as leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Only when that money flows will county governments be able to shut
down "snake pits" with confidence, knowing that rescued patients will
find clean, well-staffed, independence-oriented alternatives and not
wind up in jail or sleeping in a filthy heap of rags under a bridge.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani's Tough New Gig</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a man of outsize ego and
personality, has signed a contract with Mexico City's mayor to help
him stop a seemingly uncontrollable wave of kidnappings, robberies
and murder there. Giuliani, who was happy to take some credit for New
York's drop in crime in the 1990s, will have a tougher challenge in
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   First, he won't be the boss -- for the mercurial Giuliani, a
tongue-biting dilemma. He'll just be the consultant -- though with a
package deal of $4.3 million paid by a group of Mexico City
businessmen, he'll be a well-paid hired hand.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani has put together a team of 15 former associates, among
them former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former
city Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, and Richard Sheirer, former
coordinator of New York City's Office of Emergency Management. They
will have a year to evaluate Mexico City's police force and make
recommendations.</LD>
<TE>   Which brings up problem No. 2: On average, Mexico City police are
paid about $6,500 annually, less than half a livable middle-class
salary. Underpaying cops is a fast route to crime-promoting
corruption, not just in Mexico but much of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani deserves credit for seeking a way to do good, even
well-compensated good. Perhaps he'll model the rest of his
postelectoral career on former President Jimmy Carter, whose
continued efforts to promote global human rights helped earn him the
Nobel Peace Prize. Giuliani already has a leg up on former President
Clinton, who is still casting about for his proper role -- on TV or
elsewhere. Or the democratic hero of Poland, Lech Walesa, reportedly
hired to host a television program on fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani certainly hasn't taken an easy path. In Mexico City, an
estimated two-thirds of all crimes go unreported because no one
trusts presumably crooked cops. If he can change that, he'll have
other Latin American leaders knocking at his door.</TE>

<LD>My colleagues and I share the concern expressed by your letter
writers (Oct. 16) about information available on judicial officers
who appear on the November ballot. The administrative office of the
courts has established a Web site that contains biographies of each
of the justices as well as access to recent Supreme Court and Court
of Appeal opinions at www.courtinfo.ca.gov /courts/courtsofappeal/2nd
District/justices.htm. Our hearings, conducted on the third floor of
the Ronald Reagan State Building, 300 S. Spring St. in L.A., are open
to the public.</LD>
<LD>   We have seven divisions in Los Angeles, each of which hears
approximately 50 cases each month. Our calendars are available on the
Web site or from the clerk of the court. Our opinions are published
in hard copy by West Publishing Co. in its California Reporter series
and in the Official California Reports and online through services
such as Westlaw and Lexis. We are also available to speak to classes
at high schools and colleges, at bar association functions and before
service groups.</LD>

<LD>Re "Serbian Vote Invalidated by Low Turnout," Oct. 14: If federal
elections with less than 50% participation of eligible voters were
invalid in the U.S., how many of the past elections would be valid?
Frequently I hear the saying, "Why bother voting; my vote does not
count in any case." Maybe we should bring about change in the voting
laws, requiring 50% participation of eligible voters. A case in
point: Of the members of Congress to be elected in the coming
election, only a few seats are contested. This sounds to me more like
incumbency than democracy.</LD>

<HD>A Draft Would Drain Away Support for a War With Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Draft Would Cast a Chill Over the Military," by Doug Bandow,
Commentary, Oct. 16: If our society was built on individual liberty,
it is also built on shared responsibility and public service. The
"Washington elite" that Bandow is so against allowing to tell us how
to live our lives is the same group of fellows pushing for a war with
Iraq. They know that if they asked more of us than displaying
patriotic bumper stickers and waving the flag from our cars as we
drive to the mall, the supposed support for this war would head south
in a New York minute.</LD>
<LD>   If we have one problem that permeates the society from top to
bottom, it's selfishness. A year or two of some sort of mandatory
national service, whether in the Army or fixing potholes in the
streets, would be helpful to the society and to the men and women who
would serve.</LD>
<LD>   Marty Schoen</LD>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bandow's commentary really hit home for me. As an 18-year-old
freshman in college, my peers and I would be most affected by a
draft. The military wouldn't be the only place feeling a chill if a
draft were imposed.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's attacks on America, many of my high school
friends immediately enlisted. Within weeks of our high school
graduation this past June I had friends entering boot camp to begin
their training. They did so voluntarily, but I think many of them
would have been resentful if they had been required to join. They
wanted to defend our country, but of their own free will.</TE>
<TE>   I feel our military is far more effective with people who want to
be there, rather than drafted soldiers who would be angry because
they had been forced into service. A draft would cause a new wave of
draft-dodging. People who willingly serve would resent draftees and
draft dodgers, and those being drafted would feel a great resentment
toward the government. When there are more than enough soldiers
already enlisted on active duty and in the reserves, why implement a
draft?</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Forbes</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Country</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If I could change one thing about how a draft was conducted, I
would ensure against any deferment except for obvious physical or
mental shortcomings. Then there wouldn't be a disproportionate number
of blacks and Latinos in uniform, and we'd find out just what "United
We Stand" really means. A war with Iraq is an American war: Either
everyone of draft age goes, volunteer or draftee, or nobody goes.
President Bush will understand. And body bags are gender-neutral.
He'll understand that, too.</TE>

<HD>Santa Monica Wrestles With Its Identity Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't know what rose-colored glasses were worn to get the facts on
Santa Monica's current state of affairs ("Sea Change in Santa
Monica," Oct. 16). However, as a lifelong resident of this city, the
only thing I concur with is that Santa Monica has indeed changed
since the renters-rights progressives took the helm of government in
1979. Santa Monica used to be a quiet, compatible mix of owners and
tenants. Apartment and business owners were long-term and small-time.
And city leaders represented a broad range of concerns and interests,
unlike the social icons of today who gear laws to favor only one
narrow constituency.</LD>
<LD>   Under the social engineering of renters' rights, Santa Monica has
emerged as an overdeveloped, crowded, superficial, divisive magnet
for rich liberals clutching lattes in their uncalloused hands while
workers clean their rent-controlled apartments for zip wages.
Carrying newspapers and laptops around on sunny days, these same
busybody activists plan their latest strategy for controlling
business corridors near the beach, sympathetically calling it a
"living-wage ordinance."</LD>
<LD>   Liberal policymakers are also furrowing their brows, trying to
figure out how to fend off the throngs of transients who were
originally invited to Santa Monica by the unthinking, anti-resident,
lax policies they created.</LD>
<TE>   Jan Tousignant</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica has betrayed its past and the rapidly shrinking
majority of its constituency.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office is afraid of its shadow and does not in
any way forcefully enforce the laws on the books to protect tenants.
The Department of Building and Safety fails to follow up on gross
violations, as it knows the city attorney's office won't do anything
anyway. The City Council is afraid to confront the city attorney's
office even though it knows the laws are being violated, people's
rights are being trampled and nothing is being done to stop it. The
few who haven't sold out are left to scratch, scrape and fight an
increasingly difficult uphill battle as Santa Monica becomes, not
Beverly Hills by the sea, but worse yet, Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Though I live in West Los Angeles now, I spent 15 years in Santa
Monica as a witness -- and then became a victim -- of this sea
change. Big money and developers rule. The heart and soul and
character of Santa Monica and the protection of many rights for the
average citizen who doesn't have deep pockets are rapidly becoming
things of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Rubin</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If left-wingers in Santa Monica want a home and they really value
"funk," why not set up shop in Compton or South-Central Los Angeles
or even Inglewood? Come on, why live a lie? Walk the talk and I'll
have some respect for you.</TE>

<LD>In his Oct. 17 editorial cartoon (Commentary), Michael Ramirez
suggests that the commitments and contributions to world peace of
Jimmy Carter and Yasser Arafat are somehow equivalent. What thought
processes were involved here? ("Carter is a Democrat. That's bad.
Arafat is a terrorist. That's bad. Therefore, Carter and Arafat are
both bad.") Is Ramirez attempting to bring Carter down to the level
of Arafat or Arafat up to the level of Carter?</LD>
<LD>   I enjoy thought-provoking commentary, whether or not espousing
viewpoints I agree with. In the case of Ramirez, however, it's not a
matter of agreeing or disagreeing but rather of being disappointed
that The Times offers such a distinguished platform to one so utterly
clueless.</LD>

<LD>Re "Restaurant Grades Get High Marks" (Oct. 17), about customers'
responses to the restaurant grading system: Unfortunately, this
program has a major flaw -- it is very unfair to the restaurants. Any
violations must be immediately corrected. The health inspector
returns to confirm the correction, but the letter grade will not be
changed to reflect compliance until the next regular inspection.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant can fight to have the sign changed more quickly,
but it is very expensive and difficult. I believe a restaurant that
is in compliance with health department standards should be able to
display an A.</LD>

<LD>I have just read "No on After-School Plan," your Oct. 17 editorial on
Proposition 49, sponsored by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I cannot help
but think that your "no" recommendation for the afternoon kids'
programs put forth on this ballot initiative was because of the
possibility that Schwarzenegger (who is Republican) may run for
governor in the next election if Bill Simon does not win.</LD>
<LD>   If this proposition was proposed from one who is of the liberal
side, I don't think this editorial would have been written. Since
when does The Times speak out against liberals who want to spend the
taxpayers' money and think the voters should vote for kids? The
November ballot is filled with bond measures that are not what they
seem and will do nothing but burden the voter financially for years
to come.</LD>

<TE>   I want to applaud your position on Proposition 49. I have
administered child-care and after-school programs for over 20 years
and care deeply about the availability of these programs. I agree
that Proposition 49 does not do what families and children will need;
in fact, it could hurt more children than it helps.</TE>
<TE>   By taking mandated funds from the general fund, Proposition 49 is
likely to draw funding away from child care for the very young --
health care and other social services that children need. Proposition
49 sounds good on the surface, but it would be a shame if voters
support it without knowing the facts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I find it difficult to believe that the L.A. Unified School District
will make the right decision if the bond issue passes (editorial,
Oct. 17). Obviously, no one at The Times who endorsed Measure K has
driven down Soto Street and noticed the LAUSD's District F office.
Every day for the past 25 years I've driven by it on the way to my
school. The district office has been upgraded and beautifully painted
three times. My school, a few miles down the road, in a high-density
poverty area, has never been painted.</LD>
<LD>   I only wish that the district would make our school as beautiful
as it did its district office. On behalf of my kids, my question is,
if the district can find money to paint its office three times, why
can't it find the money to paint my school, just once?</LD>

<HD>Manuel Alvarez Bravo, 100; Mexican Photographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel Alvarez Bravo, the "maestro" of Mexican photography whose
images captured the complexity and beauty of the country's indigenous
roots and its Spanish heritage, its harsh natural beauty and its
delicacy, died Saturday at his home in Mexico City. He was 100.</LD>
<LD>   Alvarez Bravo died of natural causes. He was hospitalized this
month for a lung infection but was released on Oct. 14.</LD>
<LD>   Widely regarded as the leading Latin American photographer of the
20th century, he was, as poet Octavio Paz noted, Mexico's foremost
visual storyteller, narrating a sequence of Mexican history through
his poetic eye.</LD>
<TE>   "He has shown us realities in rotation, momentary freezes of
time," wrote Paz. "Everything entwines and untwines. Revelations of
the instant but also instants of revelation."</TE>
<TE>   Much of that reality dealt with the destitution of the poor and
the working class in Mexico City's streets.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo cited his 1931 photo, "The Dreamer" as one of his
favorites, where he captured a young boy napping on a concrete block
with only a sheet beneath him, with his face toward the sky as if
dreaming of a better life.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy to have lived those streets," Alvarez Bravo once said.
"There everything was food for my camera, everything had an inherent
social content; in life everything has a social content."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo, born in 1902, was the fifth child in a family of
eight children in Mexico City. His father was a teacher and his
mother the caretaker. Growing up during the time of the Mexican
Revolution, he studied accounting in school and began working at the
National Treasury at the age of 14.</TE>
<TE>   But as a young adult, he yearned to produce something creatively
and was attracted to photography while studying art in the evenings
at the Academia San Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924, he bought his first camera, a Century Master, and trained
himself to be a photographer by learning techniques from books and
periodicals. Five years later, Alvarez Bravo was doing enough
professional photography to quit his treasury job. When his friend
and fellow photographer Tina Modotti was expelled from Mexico in 1930
for her political beliefs, Alvarez Bravo took over her job as the
photographer of the works of such muralists as Diego Rivera, Jose
Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros and also photographed for
a publication called Mexican Folkways.</TE>
<TE>   When photographic commissions were slow during the 1930s, Alvarez
Bravo taught photography at the San Carlos Academy. His marriage in
1925 to Lola Martinez de Anda, whom he had known since 1916, ended in
divorce in 1934. They had one son, Manuel Alvarez Bravo Martinez. In
1962, Alvarez Bravo married Colette Alvarez Urbajtel, who survives
him, as do his son; two daughters, Aurelia and Genoveva; and a
grandson. His photography reflected the many interests of Alvarez
Bravo -- a man whose graciousness allowed him entry to the spheres of
the rich and educated as well as the poor and humble.</TE>
<TE>   As Arthur Ollman, the director of San Diego's Museum of
Photographic Arts, wrote in a catalog for an exhibition of the
photographer's work, "There are many Manuel Alvarez Bravos. That is
his power. There is the pre-Columbian Alvarez Bravo, a worshiper of
bulls and sacrificer of virgins ... whose work and thought abound
with Mayan and Aztec symbols.... There is another Alvarez Bravo who
is purely Mexican in the revolutionary spirit.... This Alvarez Bravo
is a trenchant worshiper of justice, enemy of all oppressors, a proud
eagle devouring a snake while perched on a cactus."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was a celebrated photographer in Mexico and Europe, he
was not as well known in the United States until the Pasadena Art
Museum (now the Norton Simon Museum) held a retrospective of his work
in 1971. The show then traveled to the Museum of Modern Art in New
York. The J. Paul Getty Museum was among several leading American
museums to mount a major retrospective of his work to mark the
occasion of his 100th birthday Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo lived during one of Mexico's most enlightened eras,
when intellectuals and revolutionaries were at the center of the
country's artistic movements.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Rivera chronicled Mexico's history, indigenous roots and
cultural identity in paintings, Alvarez Bravo chronicled the pulse of
Mexico through his photographs.</TE>
<TE>   His circle of friends included Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Juan Rulfo,
Rufino Tamayo, Paul Strand, Sergei Eisenstein, D.H. Lawrence and
Modotti. Though Alvarez Bravo never joined the Communist Party and
Rivera, Kahlo and Modotti did, he was sympathetic to leftist causes.</TE>
<TE>   His friendships with the intellectuals and bohemians who gathered
in Mexico at the time reflected one of the many aspects of his
character.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the educated, urbane, Europeanized Alvarez Bravo," wrote
Ollman. "This Alvarez Bravo knows what the world thinks and needs
Mexico to be: a land of surrealism and free association, an illogical
region where ancient civilization miscegenates with Euro-American
fantasy. This anything-goes Mexico, a saintly yet violent country, so
loved and believed in by the art world, a Mexico for slumming
gringos."</TE>
<TE>   It was through Modotti that Alvarez Bravo became acquainted with
Edward Weston, who later showed with Alvarez Bravo, Imogen Cunningham
and Dorothea Lange at the Berkeley Art Museum in 1929. Even though
Weston had never heard of the young Mexican photographer, he was
impressed with Alvarez Bravo's images, calling them "photographs of
better than usual technique, and of excellent viewpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Modotti had become a close friend of Alvarez Bravo, introducing
him to many of the artistic and intellectual elite of the era. When
Modotti was banished from Mexico, Alvarez Bravo was the only friend
to bid her farewell as she left for the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "I got [to the train station first] and it gave her great pleasure
to see me," he said to a biographer once. "She took a window seat and
I sat down next to her in the train, and when the whistles blew I got
off and waved to her from below. She was still very nervous but ...
she showed the same friendliness and warmth as always."</TE>
<TE>   Like Modotti, Alvarez Bravo focused primarily on the common
people. He captured the beauty in the everyday occurrences of life
and nature and had the patience required to capture a spontaneous
moment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, Alvarez Bravo met Henri Cartier-Bresson, the French
photographer who, like Alvarez Bravo, was known for capturing
authentic human interaction. The young Cartier-Bresson arrived in
Mexico as part of a photographic expedition sponsored by the Mexican
government. But when funding for that fell through, he hooked up with
Alvarez Bravo and the pair shared an exhibition of their photographs
in Mexico City's Palace of Fine Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo's interpretations were often laced with surrealist
detail. He was heavily influenced by his friends, the surrealist
artists Man Ray and Andre Breton. Breton, in fact, asked Alvarez
Bravo to shoot the catalog cover photograph for the 1940
International Surrealist Exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment of "truly surrealist" inspiration, Alvarez Bravo
created the concept for "Good Reputation Sleeping," which became one
of his most recognized photographs. The image of a nude, bandaged
woman lying beside cactus buds was a testament to his surrealist
influences. The cactus flowers at the side of a sleeping woman
symbolized danger lurking beneath a serene exterior. His art,
however, could not be used for the cover due to censorship laws that
forbade such graphic photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo's observant eye captured ugly scenes of labor
disputes exploding throughout Mexico in the 1930s. His photograph
"Striking Worker, Assassinated" shows a young man lying dead after a
demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Of this photograph, Paz wrote: "The realism of this image is
startling and one can say, without exaggeration, that it approaches
the electrical territory of myth and the sacred. The fallen man is
bathed in his own blood, and that blood is silent: He has fallen into
his silence, into silence itself."</TE>
<TE>   Death was a subject that long fascinated Alvarez Bravo. Growing up
in the throes of the Mexican Revolution, he often encountered bodies
on the street or in the countryside. The Mexican ceremony, Day of the
Dead, was also a subject of intrigue.</TE>
<TE>   The death he witnessed as a boy obviously had an impact on him as
a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   "One does not exactly know how one's own sensibility and mentality
formed. It undoubtedly had an influence on me," he once told an
interviewer. "... On [the Day of Dead] they used to sell children
toys representing death--skulls made of sugar which we would eat. I
think this is where the real feeling of Mexican duality comes
from--the duality of life and death."</TE>
<TE>   The graphic reality of death and Mexico's violent city streets
were not his only backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his photographs that show such power and evoke strong
emotions, Alvarez Bravo was a shy, diminutive man. He would often
pass his time observing nature and reading.</TE>
<TE>   He was particularly fond of Mexico's magueys--a type of cactus
that is as much a part of Mexican identity as the Virgin of Guadalupe
and the national flag. In his 1930 photograph "Behind the Wall,
Magueys," he captures the plant's natural movement, almost as if it
is dancing behind a concrete wall.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1932 "Washerwomen Implied," he captures the forceful beauty
of the Mexican countryside with white sheets hanging on enormous
magueys and full, puffy white clouds blowing in the background. His
photograph leaves open mysteries, as Paz wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Clouds for sculpting images that a puff of wind will scatter.
What games, what rites are being acted out by the washerwomen, hidden
behind the whiteness?"</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo was very modest about his work and his
accomplishments. He lived comfortably in his home in Coyaocan for
most of his life, surrounded by his photos. The fact that he was
Mexico's greatest photographer never seemed to phase him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a pleasure to see that what one does has a significance,
communicates with other people, produces an interest and pleasure.
This does not mean searching for recognition -- it happens," he said
in an interview. "I think one's work should always be a form of
research, examination, inspection. It is like a stone thrown in the
water -- it makes ripples that go outward."</TE>
<TE>   Graciela Iturbide, the noted Mexican photographer who worked as
his assistant in the 1960s, said he would set up and wait for those
instants he would capture on film.</TE>
<TE>   "What impressed me, what I most remember, is that he had time for
everything," she told The Times some years ago. "To read, to listen
to music. He was on Mexican time. He was not in a hurry. He waited
until he got what he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   His body lay in state Saturday at the Palace of Fine Arts in
Mexico City. He will be buried today.</TE>

operating the first local gallery designed to show the work of
African American artists, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Walker died Oct. 13 at Daniel Freeman Medical Center of
unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Drewry, Ala., Walker moved with his family to Detroit
when he was a toddler. He was educated at the Detroit Institute of
Technology before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1940s.</LD>
<TE>   He pursued his art -- oil painting -- while making his living as a
commercial artist working for companies such as Safeway foods and
Norm's restaurants. His subject matter ranged from paintings of
African tribal people to figures in urban settings.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, he was struck by the fact that there were no
galleries in town for black artists to show their work. Walker and
his wife, Jane, found a space at Crenshaw Boulevard and 48th Street
and opened the LeJan Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had any confidence that I was doing the right thing,"
Walker told a reporter for the Los Angeles Sentinel a few years ago.
"I think it shocked people to see black art."</TE>
<TE>   A tribute exhibition of 50 Walker paintings from the last 30 years
was held at the William Grant Still Art Center in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A Times critic said Walker painted in a "straightforward, unshowy
manner." The most compelling image in the show, the reviewer said,
was "a small bust-length painting of a Masai woman adorned with great
clusters of beads around her neck and cascading from her hair."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Walker is survived by three sons, Russel,
Frederic and Jeffrey, and several grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<KH>BUFFALO 23, MIAMI 10</KH>
<HD>Lucas Fails to Execute Dolphins' Backup Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Buffalo Bills had the better quarterback, which was no surprise.
They also had the better defense, which was a shock.</LD>
<LD>   Taking advantage of an erratic effort by Miami backup quarterback
Ray Lucas, the Bills came up with four interceptions -- their first
this season -- and recovered two fumbles to beat the Dolphins, 23-10,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Nate Clements tied a team record with three interceptions for the
Bills, who began the game last in the NFL with four takeaways.</LD>
<TE>   "We said that when they come, they're going to come in bunches,
and they did today," Clements said.</TE>
<TE>   He returned his second interception 29 yards for a touchdown to
put the Bills ahead to stay in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo, which went 3-13 last season, improved to 4-3 and closed
within a game of Miami (5-2) in the AFC East.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts us right back in the middle of the race," quarterback
Drew Bledsoe said. "It was a big game for our defense. They stepped
up and caused turnovers, and we were able to capitalize."</TE>
<TE>   While the Bills committed no turnovers and scored on a 70-yard
pass play from Bledsoe to Eric Moulds, Lucas played poorly in his
first NFL start since 1999. He was replacing Jay Fiedler, who is
expected to be sidelined at least six weeks because of a broken right
thumb suffered last week in a victory over Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I played today was probably the worst a quarterback has
ever played in the history of the NFL," Lucas said. "I don't think
I've ever thrown four picks since I was born. I embarrassed
myself.... I probably won't sleep for the next three days."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas capped a 57-yard drive with a touchdown pass on the
Dolphins' first possession but finished having completed 13 for 33
passes for 165 yards. Besides the interceptions, at least three other
passes went off the hands of a defender.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's two lost fumbles came when Lucas was hit as he handed off
and on a bad exchange between him and running back Ricky Williams,
who had 97 yards in 25 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "Six turnovers against a team that's averaging 35 points a game --
it's going to be tough winning," Miami Coach Dave Wannstedt said. "It
was remarkable that the game was as close as it was."</TE>
<TE>   By the third quarter, fans were booing Lucas' errant throws. It
didn't help that he worked with an injury-depleted receiving corps
that was missing starters Chris Chambers (concussion) and Oronde
Gadsden (wrist).</TE>
<TE>   This week, Miami is expected to lure Cris Carter, the NFL's second
all-time leading pass catcher, out of retirement.</TE>

<HD>To Duval, Tiger Is in No-Win Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golfer David Duval believes the media should back off forcing Tiger
Woods to pressure Augusta National into admitting women as members.</LD>
<LD>   "Regardless of the position he takes, he's wrong," Duval said.</LD>
<LD>   "He's not ever going to be right unless he agrees with the party
that is really upset. He's entirely in a no-win situation that way."</LD>
<TE>   Woods has said he believes the exclusive Georgia club should admit
women, but he has also said that, as a private club, it has the right
to establish its membership policies.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 26 years old," Duval said. "Let him play golf. I imagine you
will see him take positions here and there, but I don't think his
focus right now should be on social change and social influence. He's
just starting his career."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Since 1986, Notre Dame has gone 29-1 in football
against Army, Navy and Air Force. Which was the last service academy
to defeat the Irish?</TE>
<TE>   No problem here: The University Interscholastic League, the
governing body for high school sports in Texas, recently conducted a
statewide survey on the use of steroids and whether standard testing
was needed.</TE>
<TE>   According to the UIL, most responding school districts felt any
testing should be handled locally, and that fewer than 20% of the
districts do testing.</TE>
<TE>   "The superintendents believe there is not a significant problem,"
said Charles Breithaupt, the UIL's athletic director. "They think it
can be dealt with through education."</TE>
<TE>   Flag on the play: Mitch Albom in the Detroit Free Press on San
Francisco 49er Terrell Owens pulling out a pen and autographing a
ball after scoring a touchdown: "You can call me square, flat, unhip,
old-fashioned, old-school, no cool or dull. When writing utensils
become part of your football gear, things have gone too far."</TE>
<TE>   Team overboard: Tom Shatel of the Omaha World-Herald, after
Nebraska's first football loss to Oklahoma State in 41 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The Huskers are in uncharted waters, lost at sea, with a boat
full of holes, no compass, no idea where they're going or how to get
there. They are impostors with amnesia who woke up with nobody to
tell them where they are."</TE>
<TE>   On this day in baseball: Carlton Fisk hit a home run in the bottom
of the 12th inning and Boston defeated Cincinnati, 7-6, in the sixth
game of the 1975 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dull world after all: Atlanta Journal-Constitution
columnist Terrence Moore isn't impressed with Edison Field:</TE>
<TE>   "There are few things I enjoy more than a stadium, ballpark or
arena, complete with beauty, history and mystique.</TE>
<TE>   "So this has been an ugly stretch for a guy who just saw the
inferior replacement to the Big A in southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The new place is called the Big Ed, as in Edison Field, or as in
boring."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia Answer: Air Force, 20-17, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rick Telander, of the Chicago Sun-Times, on new NCAA
President and CEO Myles Brand: "Brand could be a guy who makes it
clear that something has to change in big-time college sport. Or at
least he can make it clear that something ought to change."</TE>

<KH>DENVER 37, KANSAS CITY 34 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Broncos Get Sharpe Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Shannon Sharpe proved there's still plenty of life in his 34-year-old
legs. There was never a doubt about his attitude.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver tight end set a franchise record with a career-high 214
yards receiving and two second-half touchdown catches, and the
Broncos rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat the Kansas City
Chiefs, 37-34, in overtime Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Sharpe caught both scoring passes from Brian Griese, who completed
30 of 0 for a career-best 376 yards as Denver (5-2) defeated the
Chiefs (3-4) at Arrowhead Stadium for the first time since 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Griese was 20 for 33 for 278 yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   After Sharpe beat three defenders for his first touchdown, an
82-yard play, he couldn't resist needling Kansas City's fans. He bent
down in the end zone, unfastened some tape from his shoe and showed
them what was written underneath.</TE>
<TE>   "It says, 'Big Play Shay,' " Sharpe said. "I just wanted to let
everyone know I was still back."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Elam kicked a 25-yard field goal with 12:03 left in
overtime, atoning for Denver's earlier special teams mistakes with
big plays in the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   Elam's game-winner, set up by a 25-yard pass interference penalty
against cornerback Eric Warfield, was his third field goal of the
game. It came four plays after Keith Burns blocked Dan Stryzinski's
punt and Dwayne Carswell recovered at the Kansas City 32.</TE>
<TE>   Burns was glad for the shot at redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't put our offense and our defense in bad field
position, and that's what we did all day," he said. "We hung
together, and we were able to come out on top."</TE>
<TE>   Priest Holmes ran for 113 yards and three touchdowns, two of them
following mistakes by Denver's special teams in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City kicker Morten Andersen became the NFL's career field
goal leader with 479, one more than Minnesota's Gary Anderson, then
missed 43-yarder in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Denver's Mike Anderson forced overtime with a touchdown on a
two-yard run with 21 seconds remaining. Rod Smith kept the Broncos
going with an eight-yard reception on fourth and six from Kansas
City's 29 just before the two-minute warning.</TE>

<KH>CLEVELAND 34, HOUSTON 17</KH>
<HD>Couch Satisfies Home Crowd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Tim Couch's only big mistake was misjudging the height of the wall.</LD>
<LD>   Couch, booed by Cleveland fans in his previous home game, threw a
25-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Morgan and the Browns sacked David
Carr nine times in a 34-17 victory Sunday over the Houston Texans.</LD>
<LD>   After hooking up with Morgan, Couch tried to jump into the crowd
to celebrate with Brown fans who drove him to tears by booing him two
weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   But Couch didn't quite make his leap, as his teammates reminded
him.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'We thought you were Mr. Kentucky in basketball, but
you've got no hops,' " Couch said with a laugh. "It was great to win
and get the fans back on our side."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland rookie Andre Davis had a 95-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown, and first-year running back William Green scored on a
one-yard run as the Browns (3-4) ended a losing streak at three.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Dawson kicked two field goals for Cleveland, which broke out
new, orange jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a win," Brown Coach Butch Davis said. "We needed a win
at home. We needed to stop the bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   The first-year Texans (1-5) had their chances. But Carr twice
overthrew a wide-open Corey Bradford, and Houston made too many
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans have lost five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We had too many sacks and negative plays," Coach Dom Capers said.
"We had some plays in our hands that we didn't make."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Couch tearfully reacted to fans for first booing
and then cheering after he sustained a concussion in a loss to
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Couch heard a few more boos when the Browns left the field tied
7-7 at halftime. But the former No. 1 overall draft pick won the fans
over by completing 12 of 17 passes for 86 yards and the touchdown
after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   He went nine for 10 in the third quarter, and helped spring Jamel
White for a 36-yard run in the fourth. White reversed field and
picked up a block from Couch.</TE>
<TE>   Couch finished 21 for 31 for 148 yards, and didn't throw an
interception for the first time in 13 games.</TE>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>That's no misprint in the NFL standings. The Arizona Cardinals are
tied for first place in the NFC West.</LD>
<LD>   Despite scoring no touchdowns and missing two field goals in the
final minutes of regulation, the Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys,
9-6, on Bill Gramatica's 40-yard field goal with 3:10 left in
overtime Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals (4-2) are off to their best start since 1988, their
first season in Arizona, and are tied for first with San Francisco.
The teams meet next Sunday in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   "To be in first place six games into the season is great,"
quarterback Jake Plummer said. "When those 16 games are done, that's
where I want to be."</TE>
<TE>   Gramatica had missed from 28 and 51 yards in the last 3:24 of
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to make every kick. I don't care if it's 28 or 51," he
said. "The team killed themselves to give me an opportunity for
another shot."</TE>
<TE>   Gramatica's field goals of 41 and 23 yards put Arizona ahead, 6-0,
in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Quincy Carter threw four interceptions in the game, and
the Cowboys (3-4) botched an extra-point kick.</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith gained a season-high 82 yards in 22 carries, leaving
him 92 yards shy of Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record of
16,726. But the ground game couldn't make up for Carter's
interceptions -- two of which were made in the end zone. Carter
expected to get the blame for the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing that you've got to go through as a quarterback.
You've got to stand up and face the heat when it's on you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cowboy Coach Dave Campo: "He's going to have to really look
at himself in this one, because we had an opportunity to get some
things done. But let me stress one thing: There were enough penalties
and other things where this was a team effort. We're not going to
point fingers at any one individual."</TE>

<LD>It was another unbelievable weekend in college football but there are
a few things I still can't believe:</LD>
<LD>   * I can't believe Notre Dame is 7-0. If Tyrone Willingham isn't
coach of the year, a kumquat isn't a fruit. The Irish offense still
flows like continental drift, yet in the days leading to his
"Saturday Night Live" victory over Air Force, Willingham made
defensive adjustments former coach Bob Davie couldn't have made with
a tool set.</LD>
<LD>   The experts said no team could stop Air Force's triple-option
offense, which was leading the nation in rushing with a
339-yard-per-game average. Well, the Irish did everything but throw
out spike strips in holding the Falcons to 104 yards.</LD>
<TE>   The one thing it takes to stop the option is discipline on
defense, and Willingham apparently majored in the subject (with a
minor in sideline stoicism).</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame lucked out in a few games this year but the Air Force
win was no fluke and sets up Saturday's epic matchup at Florida
State.</TE>
<TE>   The schools' 1993 game in South Bend did an astounding 16.0 share
for NBC and was recently rated the No. 3 moment in Notre Dame
football history. The second-ranked Irish knocked off No. 1 Florida
State, 31-24, en route to the winning the school's 12th national
title ... well, no, it didn't quite work out that way, did it?</TE>
<TE>   The Irish, in fact, went lilies-up the next week against Boston
College and allowed Florida State to backdoor its way to its first
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   This week, a victory over Florida State would again make Notre
Dame a title contender. And guess which school the Irish play the
following week in South Bend?</TE>
<TE>   Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   * I can't believe Arizona State is 3-0 and shares the Pacific 10
Conference lead with Washington State. Is this the same Sun Devil
team that looked so awful against Nebraska and had to come back from
22 points down to beat San Diego State?</TE>
<TE>   No, actually. Arizona State started the year with Chad Christensen
at quarterback but has since given the job to sophomore Andrew
Walter, who rallied his team to victory against San Diego State and
then on Saturday threw for a conference-record 536 yards in a 45-42
win over No. 6 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State fans who trekked to Eugene chanted "Dirk Koetter for
President" as the Sun Devil coach left the field. That may be a
stretch given that no one named Dirk could ever be president, but
Koetter could give California's Jeff Tedford a run for Pac-10
coach-of-the-year honors.</TE>
<TE>   * I can't believe North Carolina State is ranked No. 9 in the
coaches' poll. Can we get a "Frontline" investigation to expose these
interlopers? Sorry, but two-point wins over Duke don't pass muster
with our BCS (Bogus Crummy Schedule) Committee. Wasn't it bad enough
that Kansas State tried this soft-shoe schedule act in 1998, and
Virginia Tech in 2000? How can voters keep raising the Wolfpack in
the polls for wins against New Mexico, East Tennessee State, Navy,
Massachusetts and Duke?</TE>
<TE>   How is it North Carolina State can be ranked higher than unbeaten
Bowling Green, which has at least defeated Missouri and Kansas. Is it
because North Carolina State plays in a BCS conference, the Atlantic
Coast, and Bowling Green plays in the Mid-American? Or is that being
too cynical?</TE>
<TE>   * I can't believe California and Nebraska are both 5-3. Of course,
these records have different meanings on their respective campuses.
California is 5-3 coming off a 1-10 season while Nebraska is 5-3
coming off an appearance in last year's national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Cal couldn't be any more happy with its 5-3; Nebraska couldn't be
any more ashamed. The next critical moment in Cal's season comes in
November when the school pleads its case before the NCAA appeals
committee. Cal is serving a one-year bowl ban for violations
committed by the former coaching staff and athletic administration.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, no one thought the Bears had a right-winger's chance
in Berkeley of becoming bowl qualified, but suddenly the school's
appeal in Chicago has as much meaning as any pass Kyle Boller has
thrown this year.</TE>
<TE>   * I can't believe Iowa State was all that good to begin with.
Watch out for the Cyclones, everyone said. Seneca Wallace is the real
deal, everyone said. What everyone missed was the fact Iowa State
always stood a good chance ending up 8-5. The Wallace-for-Heisman
campaign hit a dead-end Oklahoma defense on Saturday that held the
quarterback to four completions for 43 yards, three interceptions,
and minus-28 yards rushing in a 49-3 defeat. Iowa State fell to 6-2
and still has to play at Texas, at Colorado and at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   * I can't believe UCLA Coach Bob Toledo's job is in jeopardy -- at
least not now. The strange twist to the Bruins losing two
quarterbacks to injuries in a 17-12 defeat at Cal is that it may have
bought Toledo some time. How can this pivotal season in Toledo's
career be fairly evaluated now? You could argue that, had Cory Paus
not broken his ankle, UCLA might have defeated Cal and improved to
5-2 and 2-1 in Pac-10 play.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Conference commissioners a few years ago decided to rotate the
handling of the BCS standings to avoid the perception of bias toward
a particular league. This year, the ACC turned over release
responsibilities to the Big East. For what it's worth, Miami and
Virginia Tech, two Big East schools, could be 1-2 today in the first
BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   The most overlooked receiver in the country may be Arizona State
junior Shaun McDonald, who caught 12 passes for 204 yards in
Saturday's win over Oregon and has nine touchdown catches this year.</TE>
<TE>   With two quarterbacks on medical leave, it can't make Toledo feel
better knowing that J.P. Losman, the quarterback he signed instead of
Boller, tossed two touchdown passes and ran for another in Tulane's
win over Alabama Birmingham. Losman's bizarre transfer out of UCLA
has messed up the Bruin quarterback situation ever since.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 20, TAMPA BAY 10</KH>
<HD>Eagles Come to Own Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Tampa Bay's outstanding defense couldn't overcome an inept offense.</LD>
<LD>   Donovan McNabb passed for one touchdown and ran for another to
lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a 20-10 victory over the Buccaneers
on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fourth consecutive victory for Philadelphia (4-2) over
Tampa Bay (5-2), and it ended the Buccaneers' winning streak at five.</LD>
<TE>   "They are really good on defense, but we have to do a lot better
to ever beat the Eagles," Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers recorded their only touchdown on an 11-yard fumble
return by Derrick Brooks. Philadelphia's defense gave up only 207
total yards and had six sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Statistically, their defense was No. 1. I firmly believe ours is
No. 1," Eagle Coach Andy Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb completed 12 of 25 passes for 127 yards with one
interception, and ran for a career-low four yards in six carries.
McNabb connected with Todd Pinkston on a 42-yard touchdown pass play
in the second quarter that put Philadelphia ahead, 10-7, and had a
one-yard touchdown run in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't kill us today, but he found his man when he had to find
him," Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp said of McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   Duce Staley ran for 24 times for 152 yards, including a 57-yard
run late in the fourth quarter."We knew running the ball would wear
them down. We just had to be patient," said Staley, who had his first
100-yard game since Week 9 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson exited in the fourth quarter
because of a rib injury. Rob Johnson replaced him.</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 30, CAROLINA 0</KH>
<HD>Versatile Vick Leads Falcons' Runaway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Michael Vick feigned a pass to escape one defender, got past another
by breaking a tackle and tiptoed down the sideline for a 44-yard
touchdown on what would be his final play of the day.</LD>
<LD>   He kept right on running, disappearing into the tunnel, probably
looking for a television so he could watch what he had just done.</LD>
<LD>   "It's amazing," Vick said. "I just get up after some plays and
say, 'Oh, man, I can't wait to see that one on film.' "</LD>
<TE>   In a virtuoso one-man performance, Vick accounted for 297 yards
running, passing and receiving to lead the Atlanta Falcons past the
Carolina Panthers, 30-0, on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy who was sidelined the Falcons' previous game
because of a shoulder injury. Not bad for a guy who played only three
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Vick had all sorts of plays worthy of a highlight film, saving the
best for last. His 44-yard touchdown was the second-longest run by a
quarterback in Falcon history, eclipsed only by Bob Berry's 45-yarder
in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The second-year quarterback completed 16 of 22 passes for 178
yards and ran six times for 91 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally different than reading about him or seeing him on
film or TV," Panther safety Mike Minter said. "The guy is quick, fast
and strong. I mean, we had him dead-on a couple of times."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta (3-3) moved past the Panthers in the NFC South, winning
for the third time in four games. Carolina (3-4) lost its fourth
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Weinke, starting for the Panthers at quarterback in place of
injured Rodney Peete, left in the first half because of a possible
concussion.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 7 IN THE NFL SAM FARMER</KH>
<HD>Their Name Has Become Mud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego's Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson beat the Raiders with
a devastating combination punch; St. Louis running back Marshall
Faulk scored four touchdowns; and the football world got a reminder
Sunday of why no one in the NFL wants to be like Mike (see: Holmgren,
Tice).</LD>
<LD>   The 2-5 Rams of former genius Mike Martz beat the 1-5 Seahawks of
former genius Mike Holmgren -- hey, somebody had to win -- and Mike
Tice's 1-5 Vikings were shut out for more than three quarters by the
New York Jets, who began the weekend having allowed 32 points a game.
The Vikings lost, 20-7.</LD>
<LD>   Another Mike, Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan was riding so high after
a 37-34 victory in overtime at Kansas City he could have floated home
to Denver. Hours later, the Chargers needed overtime to beat the
Raiders with a Tomlinson touchdown run, lending credence to the
notion the AFC West is the league's toughest division.</LD>
<TE>   The Denver-Kansas City game was a classic. The Chiefs built a
14-point lead in the fourth quarter on the running of Priest Holmes,
who gained 113 yards and scored three touchdowns against the NFL's
top-ranked rushing defense. This was a defense that affixed a Denver
boot to some of the league's best running backs, among them Garrison
Hearst, Ricky Williams, Faulk and Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes has 14 touchdowns in seven games, the best start in NFL
history. Regardless, Priest couldn't deliver last rites to the
Broncos, mostly because he was backed up by the might and muscle of
Kansas City's gauze-curtain defense. Yes, the Chiefs have scored a
league-leading 102 points in the fourth quarter, but that's only
three points more than their defense has allowed in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the squad, 'When you boil it down, one play makes the
difference. You don't make the play, you lose,' " Kansas City Coach
Dick Vermeil said. "We had opportunities to put them away and we
couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   The toe-to-toe scoring flurry was settled by the toe of Jason
Elam, who made a 25-yard field goal in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Denver's Shannon Sharpe scored two touchdowns, including the
longest of his career, a catch and run that covered 82 yards early in
the second quarter. He couldn't resist ribbing the Kansas City fans
after he crossed the goal line. He bent down in the end zone, peeled
some tape off his shoe and revealed what was written underneath: "Big
Play Shay."</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to let everyone know I was still back," said
Sharpe, the all-time touchdown leader among NFL tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   Not yet back is Denver safety Kenoy Kennedy, who the NFL suspended
for a game because of his helmet-to-helmet hit on Miami receiver
Chris Chambers a week earlier. The Broncos disputed the decision,
saying Chambers' head was shoved down just before he was hit, and
some Denver players even passed the hat to reimburse Kennedy the
$25,294 game check he missed. The NFL stepped in and declared that a
no-no.</TE>
<TE>   Say this for Kennedy: He doesn't shy from contact. The same cannot
be said of an unnamed Detroit player lambasted on the radio last week
by Lion General Manager Matt Millen, a former Pro Bowl linebacker. He
was a guest Thursday on a Chicago sports talk show hosted by Mike
Ditka and spoke of a "devout coward" on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Millen's team went on to post a 23-20 overtime victory over
Chicago on Sunday and prove not every Detroit player is a cowardly
Lion. Kicker Jason Hanson forced overtime with a field goal, then
made a 48-yarder in overtime that allowed the 2-4 Lions to match last
season's victory total.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Joey Harrington has his first fourth-quarter comeback as a
pro, something he did 10 times at the University of Oregon. He didn't
throw a touchdown pass, but he didn't have a pass intercepted,
either.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very close a couple times and haven't pulled it out,
so it's a frustrating feeling being 2-4," he said. "But it's a good
feeling because we've been so close and we've been improving. We're
really optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Not nearly as upbeat as the New Orleans Saints, though, who pulled
off a 35-27 victory over longtime nemesis San Francisco. This time,
it was the 49ers victimized by a pen-wielding joker. During the
fourth quarter, a fan ran onto the field and briefly joined the
team's huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a ball-point pen and was trying to sign my shirt," 49er
center Jeremy Newberry said. "He could have stabbed me or something.
How did he get out there untouched?"</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Owens wasn't afforded the same treatment. He was roughed
up by Saint defenders and limited to four catches for 61 yards. He
did score a touchdown, but there were no elaborate celebrations in
the wake of his end zone autograph session six days earlier. He
merely tossed the ball to a fan in a 49er jersey, who proved to be no
sharpie, fumbling it back onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the common man. Makes you appreciate the sure hands of players
such as Sharpe, who had 214 yards receiving, and the amazing feet of
Faulk (183) and Tomlinson (153).</TE>
<TE>   The most complete performance came from Atlanta quarterback
Michael Vick, who passed for 178 yards, ran for a 44-yard touchdown,
and got credit for 28 yards receiving after running with a lateral.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a freak," teammate Patrick Kearney said. "A human can't do
what he's doing. He's a genetic step above the rest of the NFL. We
better be careful. The Army is going to kidnap him, brainwash us so
we don't know where he went and create an army of Michael Vick
clones."</TE>
<TE>   Just don't call them Mike.</TE>

<HD>No Easy Ride in Serra League</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took the opening week of Serra League play for the six schools to
show why the new and enhanced league is considered the toughest in
California.</LD>
<LD>   League favorites Los Angeles Loyola and Santa Margarita lost their
openers, demonstrating the depth and balance of a league that is only
four years old but already establishing traditions unlike any other.</LD>
<LD>   Bellflower St. John Bosco, which had been playing the role of
league cellar-dweller, registered its most significant league victory
by defeating Santa Margarita, then No. 7 in The Times' rankings,
28-23.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves (4-2, 1-0) held the Eagles (5-1, 0-1) to three points
on two drives inside the St. John Bosco 10-yard line and capitalized
on the scrambling ability of quarterback Joseph Souza, who ran for
three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   At East L.A. College, Santa Ana Mater Dei put a 28-10 whipping on
Loyola, which was making its debut in a league that expanded from
four to six teams this season with the addition of the Cubs and La
Puente Bishop Amat.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei was ranked No. 14 and Loyola No. 2 at the time, but the
outcome didn't feel like an upset, considering the way the Monarchs
(5-1, 1-0) dominated on offense and defense. Rafael Rice rushed for
151 yards and the Mater Dei defense limited Cub starting quarterback
Adam Gonzalez to 24 yards on two-of-10 passing.</TE>
<TE>   "The character's starting to come and the pride is starting to
come," said Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson, whose team has made huge
strides since almost losing to Orange Lutheran in the season opener.
"We're going to keep working hard and continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Servite is playing so well right now that the Friars have
already established themselves among Southern California's best. The
Friars toppled Bishop Amat, 37-20, to improve to 6-0, their best
start since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   That was also the last year Servite beat rival Mater Dei. The
challenge of getting back to that level is one reason why Friar Coach
Larry Toner covets membership in this league.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the demands that the schools put on their people," Toner
said. "Every week, it's physically and mentally exacting. And I like
the tradition of the rivalries. It makes the games interesting for
us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was a buzz in the Long Beach Veterans Stadium crowd Thursday
night, and the source was unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach running back Patrick Harrigan came into the
Sunset League opener against Los Alamitos with 1,252 yards in five
games, an average of 250 yards per contest, tops in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest question was whether he could sustain his success
against the Griffins, No. 5 in The Times' rankings. Harrigan answered
with an emphatic 48-carry, 310-yard performance in a 42-21 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He's good," said Los Alamitos safety Randy Estes. "He's a hard
back to take down. If you come up without any enthusiasm, he's going
to run you over. We just had to bring it hard every time."</TE>
<TE>   Harrigan had been largely unknown before the season. A tough
runner with good instincts, he said he hasn't drawn much interest
from colleges despite his string of great performances.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what will happen," he said. "Only God knows what
will happen. I'm just thankful that I can be out here every week
doing what I have to do for my team."</TE>
<TE>   Harrigan had 194 yards by halftime, but the Griffins made some
adjustments and shut out the Oilers in the second half. Los Alamitos
Coach John Barnes didn't seem that impressed with the running back's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "They got beat by 21 points, so it doesn't make any difference to
me," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente is feeling good about a couple of bad snaps that
almost cost the Tritons dearly late in their 28-20 victory over
Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The first poor snap came with three seconds to play on a potential
game-winning, 30-yard field-goal attempt. Triton holder Matt Mitchell
picked up the low snap, rolled right and threw a 13-yard touchdown
pass to Cheyne Verhagen.</TE>
<TE>   "We call that play a fire drill," San Clemente Coach Eric Patton
said. "Matt starts yelling, 'Fire! Fire! Fire!' and the four eligible
receivers go out into a route."</TE>
<TE>   The high extra-point snap deflected off Mitchell's hands into the
hands of kicker Chris Miller, who threw to Aubrey McCravey for a
two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Patton said Triton center Brian De La Puente, suffering from a
back ailment, is one of the best snappers he has coached despite the
rough night. He will continue to handle the snapping duties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Encino Crespi finished 0-10. This season, the Celts
are off to a 5-1 start, and second-year Coach Troy Thomas is not only
performing admirably as a coach but also as a new parent. Son Houston
was born Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "[Troy] changed all the diapers at the hospital," said his wife,
Stacey. "He was good, surprisingly."</TE>
<TE>   Another coach learning about changing diapers is L.A. Fremont's
Pete Duffy, whose wife gave birth to a son, Anthony Joseph, Oct. 8.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Curtis Martin hopes Chad Pennington's performance Sunday changes the
way opposing teams look at the New York Jets.</LD>
<LD>   Pennington, in the second start of his three-season NFL career,
completed 24 of 29 passes for 324 yards to lead the Jets past the
Minnesota Vikings, 20-7.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of my friends would say to me, 'Curtis, we're coming in
there to shut you down,' " Martin said. "That's not the case anymore.
Now when teams look at us, they know they can't put the eight-man
front in there."</LD>
<TE>   With Pennington opening up the offense, and the defense suddenly
looking more aggressive, the Jets (2-4) won for the first time since
opening the season with a victory over Buffalo in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota (1-5) -- coming off a victory over the Detroit Lions --
has lost 13 consecutive road games.</TE>
<TE>   Daunte Culpepper and Randy Moss struggled to connect. Culpepper
threw three interceptions, and Moss had only four catches for 86
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Jet receiver Santana Moss had his first 100-yard game in his two
NFL seasons, making five catches for 111 yards. He came into the game
with only six receptions for 109 yards.</TE>
<TE>   New York's maligned defense forced four turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Mo Lewis had his best game of the season, making an
interception, forcing the key fumble and putting constant pressure on
Culpepper .</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of talented players, and what they need to do is
play together as a football team and believe in what we're doing,"
Jet Coach Herman Edwards said. "We did that today. They have a lot of
pride, and they don't want to play the way we played the last four
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Pennington gave the Jets a 10-0 lead just before halftime when he
threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Pennington guided the Jets on a six-play,
90-yard drive that included a 46-yard completion to Moss and a
28-yarder to Coles. Martin completed the drive with a five-yard
touchdown run that made the score 17-0.</TE>

<KH>DETROIT 23, CHICAGO 20 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Believe It, Lions Are No Patsies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Lions have won as many games in six weeks as they did all
of last season. They still don't think the general perception of them
has changed.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Hanson's 48-yard field goal with 10:18 left in overtime gave
Detroit a 23-20 victory Sunday over the Chicago Bears, who have lost
four in a row.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it silences a lot of people, I really don't," said
James Stewart, who had a career-high 172 yards and two touchdowns in
32 carries. "I really think people will still look at us as being on
the bottom of the league. I really don't think this win makes people
change their minds about us, but we can't worry about that."</LD>
<TE>   While Lions (2-4) matched their victory total from last season,
the Bears (2-4) have more regular-season losses than last season,
when they won their first division title since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was especially sweet for rookie quarterback Joey
Harrington, who failed to lead Detroit to fourth-quarter comeback
victories last week against Minnesota and in his first start against
Green Bay -- having passes intercepted each time. This time, he led
two long drives that produced field goals that sent the game into
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago scored 17 consecutive points for a 20-14 lead midway
through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, who was 16 for 30 for 199 yards with no interceptions,
then led a 14-play, 66-yard drive to pull the Lions within three
points late in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The game-tying 12-play, 72-yard drive set up Hanson's 24-yard
field goal with two seconds left. A play earlier, it appeared that
safety Larry Whigham's sack of Harrington had ended the game, but it
was negated by a false start by Lion rookie tight end Matt Murphy</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 30, WASHINGTON 9</KH>
<HD>Packers Just Hope That Favre Is OK</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Brett Favre hobbled off the field, leaving the Green Bay Packers to
wonder how long they might be without their star quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Favre, who started for the 164th consecutive time Sunday, suffered
a sprained left knee when he was sacked by LaVar Arrington in Green
Bay's 30-9 victory over the Washington Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   "There's some swelling but not a lot of it. It appears like he's
going to be OK," Packer Coach Mike Sherman said. "There was a lot of
concern by us on the sideline, but it appears he'll be fine. We're
going ... see [today] if there's more swelling, and we'll go from
there."</LD>
<TE>   Favre, at age 33 the NFC's leading passer, came out in the third
quarter and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers are off next week and don't play again until Nov. 4
against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Ahman Green had the first three-touchdown rushing performance of
his NFL career, helping the Packers (6-1) to their fifth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Green ran for 88 yards in 24 carries and scored on runs of 24, two
and eight yards, the last one after Redskin rookie quarterback
Patrick Ramsey's fifth sack and third fumble, which was recovered by
Rod Walker at the Washington 23-yard line in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the second start of his career, Ramsey overthrew his targets
all afternoon and the Redskins (2-4) managed only three field goals
by James Tuthill. Ramsey completed 10 of 24 passes for 135 yards. He
was sacked six times.</TE>
<TE>   Favre finished 11 for 14 for 89 yards and was carted off to a
standing ovation from the crowd of 63,363 at Lambeau Field with Green
Bay ahead, 17-6.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Pederson, who replaced Favre, was nine for 15 for 78 yards,
leading the Packers to two field goals and one touchdown in five
series.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the game, Favre led the NFC in passer rating (102.5),
yards passing (1,617) and touchdown passes (14). His 164 consecutive
starts are an NFL record for quarterbacks and the longest current
streak in the league at any position.</TE>
<TE>   This was the fourth time during the streak that Favre didn't
complete the game because of injury.</TE>

<KH>ST. LOUIS 37, SEATTLE 20</KH>
<HD>Rams Just Have to Hand It to Faulk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Two games of handing off to Marshall Faulk make St. Louis Ram
quarterback Marc Bulger think his teammate belongs in the Hall of
Fame right now.</LD>
<LD>   "They should put him in already, the first active player," Bulger
said Sunday after Faulk gained 183 yards in 32 carries and scored
four touchdowns in the Rams' 37-20 victory over the Seattle Seahawks.
"He's like Superman out there."</LD>
<LD>   The Rams (2-5) scored at least 30 points for the first time this
season behind Faulk's fifth career four-touchdown game, as well as
another consistent performance from third-stringer Bulger.</LD>
<TE>   "Too much Marshall Faulk today," Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren said.
"He got off to a good tart, and we had a heck of a time slowing him
down."</TE>
<TE>   The defending NFC champion Rams have won their last two games.
Bulger, elevated to the starting job by injuries to Kurt Warner
(broken finger) and Jamie Martin (knee), was 22 for 40 for 265 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't win the game for us, by any means, but at the same time
I didn't lose it for us," Bulger said. "I didn't make any big
mistakes, and I think I got us in position to make big plays, and
that was my goal."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams averaged 31 points last season, but had averaged 17
points in their first six games. They scored 28 last week, when Faulk
had 158 yards in 28 carries in a surprising win over the Raiders. On
Sunday, he matched his career high for plays from scrimmage (39),
adding seven receptions for 52 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to make adjustments in this business," said Faulk, who
also became the 15th NFL player with 10,000 yards rushing. "The teams
that make the adjustments the quickest succeed."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams held Shaun Alexander, the Seahawks' biggest offensive
threat, to 30 yards in 12 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams probably was lost for the season
after suffering a broken leg late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks (1-5) are off to their worst start since 1992, when
they began the season 1-10 and finished 2-14. It's also Holmgren's
worst start in 10 seasons as an NFL head coach.</TE>

<KH>BALTIMORE 17, JACKSONVILLE 10</KH>
<HD>Lewis Still Makes His Presence Felt</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Ray Lewis didn't make a tackle, force a fumble or have an
interception. He didn't even dress for the game.</LD>
<LD>   He was there for the Baltimore Ravens in spirit, though, and that
was good enough.</LD>
<LD>   With their five-time Pro Bowl linebacker cheering and coaching
from the sideline, the Ravens intercepted three of Mark Brunell's
passes and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 17-10, Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Redman threw two touchdown passes to Todd Heap to help
Baltimore (3-3) remain in first place in the AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Held out of a second consecutive game because of a partially
separated left shoulder, Lewis was dressed in black street clothes as
he shouted encouragement and instruction from the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having another coach on the field with us. We really
feed off his energy," Baltimore defensive tackle Kelly Gregg said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens repeatedly frustrated Brunell, who returned from a
concussion against the Tennessee Titans last week. Two of his
interceptions led to Baltimore scores and the third ruined the
Jaguars' bid to send the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "He had some limited practice time this week, but I thought he
handled himself well," Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good defensive football team over there, there's no
question about that."</TE>
<TE>   Brunell was 24 for 46 for 231 yards. Fred Taylor ran for 151 yards
and caught eight passes for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Freddie can have all the yards in the world, but when you turn
the ball over and you don't produce in the red zone, you're not going
to win," Brunell said.</TE>
<TE>   Redman was 14 for 28 for 152 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden Epstein's 22-yard field goal pulled Jacksonville (3-3)
within 17-10 with 2 minutes 30 seconds to play. The Jaguars moved to
the Baltimore 25 before rookie Will Demps intercepted Brunell's pass
to end the game.</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 35, SAN FRANCISCO 27</KH>
<HD>49ers Can't Sign Off on Comeback</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>He hated to do it, but San Francisco 49er Coach Steve Mariucci
spotted the New Orleans Saints a touchdown.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Brooks scored on a one-yard run with 1:56 left in New
Orleans' 35-27 victory Sunday, but the Saints drew a penalty for
having 12 men on the field. With only one timeout left and not
wanting to waste any more of the clock, Mariucci declined the penalty
and turned to his high-powered offense.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never done that before; has anyone even seen one?" he said.
"But it seemed to make sense.... Otherwise we're not getting the ball
back."</LD>
<TE>   Capping a sensational fourth quarter in which their offense scored
22 points, the Saints (6-1) let San Francisco get to their 39-yard
line before shutting down the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew this was going to boil down to the fourth quarter," Saint
Coach Jim Haslett said. "No matter what the score was, we knew the
fourth quarter was going to determine the outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks completed 23 of 35 passes for 254 yards and three
touchdowns, and Deuce McAllister -- the NFC's leading rusher -- had
139 yards in 21 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers (4-2) got another touchdown from Terrell Owens, but not
the kind of big performance expected of him following a week of
self-imposed hype.</TE>
<TE>   Following his second touchdown reception in last week's victory
over Seattle, Owens pulled a pen from his sock, autographed the ball
and presented it to his financial advisor sitting nearby.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Owens was held to four catches for 61 yards. His
touchdown came in the first quarter, on a four-yard pass from Jeff
Garcia. Afterward, Owens showed his sense of humor when he lifted his
feet to let his teammates inspect for pens. He then tossed the ball
to a fan wearing a 49er jersey, who dropped it.</TE>
<TE>   There was another autograph episode involving the 49ers, though.
In the fourth quarter, a fan ran onto the field and briefly joined
the team's huddle.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ravens Stadium got the Unitas touch Sunday, from the 13-foot statue
of John Unitas to a ring of honor induction for Baltimore Colt Hall
of Famers to an eloquent halftime address by the late quarterback's
wife.</LD>
<LD>   "He was very much looking forward to today and still was in awe of
it," Sandy Unitas said after an elaborate ceremony honored her
husband and seven of his former teammates. "He really didn't think he
deserved it. That was just John. But he would have been very, very
proud and thankful for the fans."</LD>
<LD>   The statue of Unitas in a throwing pose was two years in the
making. A sellout crowd of 69,173 watched on the SmartVision boards
as Unitas' grandchildren unveiled the statue on the north side of the
stadium. There were more cheers when the cover was pulled away from
two new plaques on the team's ring of honor.</LD>
<TE>   The plaques read, "Johnny Unitas &amp; the Baltimore Colts," with the
numbers of eight Baltimore Colt Hall of Famers. Five of the eight
were in attendance, including tight end John Mackey, whose impromptu
50-yard "touchdown" run with a ceremonial ball brought a roar from
the crowd. Other former Colts on hand were running back/flanker Lenny
Moore, wide receiver Raymond Berry, offensive tackle Jim Parker and
defensive tackle Art Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas' No. 19 Colts' jersey was draped over an empty chair by his
wife. He died of a heart attack on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The former Colts said they were appreciative of the unique honor
of having their numbers posted in a stadium where they never played,
by a team they never played for.</TE>
<TE>   "John, yes, he deserves everything they can possibly give him,"
Moore said. "The beautiful thing is they included us in it, because
they didn't have to do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith ran for 82 yards in the Dallas Cowboys' 9-6 overtime
loss to the Arizona Cardinals, leaving him 92 yards shy of Walter
Payton's NFL career rushing record of 16,726.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Brett Favre, who has started a record 164 consecutive games,
left during the third quarter of the Green Bay Packers' 30-9 victory
over the Redskins with a sprained left knee. He will have an MRI exam
today.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some swelling but not a lot of it. It appears like he's
going to be OK," Packer Coach Mike Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland Raider kick returner/running back Terry Kirby will miss
the rest of the season after breaking his right leg, and Raider
rookie cornerback Phillip Buchanon broke his left wrist in the 27-21
loss to the San Diego Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis Ram cornerback Aeneas Williams might be out for the
season after breaking his left leg in a 37-20 victory over the
Seattle Seahawks</TE>
<TE>   * Tampa Bay Buccaneer quarterback Brad Johnson left the 20-10 loss

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Bruins Hurting at Quarterback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERKELEY -- A team is in trouble when there are more sound
quarterbacks in the radio booth than on the sideline.</LD>
<LD>   Onetime distinguished UCLA signal-callers Matt Stevens and Wayne
Cook reported the Bruins' frustrating turn of events Saturday at
California to listeners in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Starting quarterback Cory Paus broke his right ankle and is
probably out for the season.</LD>
<TE>   Second-string quarterback Drew Olson has a sprained or separated
right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   A definitive diagnosis will be made today.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was impotent with third-string quarterback John Sciarra at
the controls in the fourth quarter and lost, 17-12, despite a strong
performance by the defense and special teams.</TE>
<TE>   The name Sciarra, like Stevens and Cook, hearkens back to more
glorious -- and healthier -- times. Sciarra's father, John, the UCLA
quarterback from 1973 to '75, was most valuable player in the 1976
Rose Bowl after the Bruins upset No. 1 Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens replaced injured David Norrie and directed a Rose Bowl
victory over Iowa in 1986 and also led the Bruins to a Freedom Bowl
victory the next year. Cook was at the controls in a 1994 Rose Bowl
loss to Wisconsin but directed victories over USC in his two years as
a starter.</TE>
<TE>   If Paus' Bruin career is over, his legacy will be one of a gritty
competitor who willed his way to No. 2 on the school's career passing
list and No. 3 in completions and touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Paus' postseason record, unless he returns for a bowl game, will
be limited to a loss to Wisconsin in the 2000 Sun Bowl, another game
in which he was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Paus recovers by late December, there is no guarantee UCLA
will have qualified for a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Not with its lack of depth at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo did the right thing grooming Olson, inserting him
into pressure situations in nonconference games. But the best-laid
plans....</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel like we miss a beat when I'm in there," Olson said.
"But now, I don't know what to say."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Moore, who like Olson was a highly recruited freshman, is
redshirting. Toledo would like to keep it that way, but Moore is
going to practice this week and will probably play if Olson is out
for an extended period because Sciarra, who had little preparation
time Saturday, does not appear to be the answer.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter against Cal, Sciarra completed one of seven
passes for 10 yards and endured one interception, two fumbles and
significant confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The only other quarterback in the program is walk-on freshman
Brian Callahan, son of Oakland Raider Coach Bill Callahan. However,
he was second string at Concord De La Salle High and isn't ready to
be thrown into the fire.</TE>
<TE>   A fan favorite is Matt Ware, the standout sophomore defensive back
who was an all-state quarterback at Loyola High.</TE>
<TE>   Ware's passing skills, however, are considered weak, and the
Bruins would have to recast their offense into an option attack, not
a likely prospect at midseason.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make UCLA long for Ryan McCann, another
inconsistent quarterback who transferred to Division I-AA Tennessee
Chattanooga rather than spend his senior year behind Paus.</TE>
<TE>   McCann has completed 55.4% of his passes for 943 yards with eight
touchdowns and eight interceptions, but the Moccasins are 0-7.</TE>
<TE>   And it's enough for Paus to feel responsible, however irrational
that feeling might be.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible for doing this to my team," he said. "I'll be
like a player-coach now."</TE>

<KH>USC REWIND</KH>
<HD>Road to Pac-10 Title Goes Through Eugene</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the traditional showdowns against UCLA and Notre Dame. USC
quarterback Carson Palmer knows that Saturday's game at Oregon is the
one that most matters for the Trojans this season.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the biggest game of the year, by far," he said.</LD>
<LD>   A victory would prove the Trojans finally belong among the elite
in the Pacific 10 Conference and go a long way toward exorcising the
demons that have plagued them on the road.</LD>
<TE>   A loss to 14th-ranked Oregon would leave No. 15 USC with two
conference losses and needing help to climb back into championship
contention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge," Palmer said. "This is the game we've all been waiting
for."</TE>
<TE>   Behind four touchdown passes from Palmer, USC rolled past
Washington, 41-21, Saturday for its seventh consecutive victory at
the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   But away from home, the Trojans have struggled in important
conference games.</TE>
<TE>   They have not beaten a ranked Pac-10 opponent on the road since
1995, the year of their last conference title. Since then, USC is
0-7-1 in such games and has lost the last seven, most recently at
Washington State, 30-27, in overtime Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the Trojan locker room Saturday needed reminding that
Oregon's raucous Autzen Stadium has been an especially difficult
place to play. Palmer, in particular, has endured a personal chamber
of horrors at Autzen.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-year senior lost there as a freshman, 17-13, in 1998
after the Trojans settled for a field goal after a touchdown was
nullified by penalty. He suffered a season-ending broken collarbone
late in the first half of a 33-30, triple-overtime loss at Autzen in
1999. And he watched last season as Jared Siegel kicked a field goal
with 12 seconds left to hand visiting USC a 24-22 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Palmer said he looks forward to the challenge of playing his
final game at Autzen and trying to end a four-game losing streak to
the Ducks. Because of a quirk in the Pac-10 schedule, he will be one
of the few players ever to play four conference games in an
opponent's stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough place to play, but I think we all love to play
there," Palmer said. "It's a fun place to play."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the Trojans know Oregon is vulnerable at home
after Arizona State stunned the previously unbeaten Ducks, 45-42,
Saturday to move into a first-place tie with idle Washington State at
3-0. USC is 3-1; Oregon is next at 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer echoed what many Trojans believe: This USC team should not
be compared to past teams that have found ways to lose.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a different team than we've ever been before when we
played" Oregon, he said. "We need to come out and run our offense. We
don't need to do anything spectacular. Just play tough defense like
we always do and cut down on all the mental mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten so many penalties at that stadium and have had so
many dumb things happen to us. We've just got to do our stuff and win
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Pollard, USC's senior middle linebacker, said it comes down
to playing well in all phases of the game -- offense, defense and
special teams. The Trojans were firing on all cylinders in their 40-3
romp at Colorado on Sept. 14, but breakdowns contributed to losses at
Kansas State, 27-20 on Sept. 21, and at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't execute in all three phases, you're not going to win
a big game on the road," Pollard said. "In the K-State and Washington
State games, we didn't execute in all phases. That's why we got
[beat]. From now on, everybody has to do their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Another senior, strong safety Troy Polamalu, called the Oregon
game "a huge test," one he believes the Trojans are prepared to pass.</TE>
<TE>   "You will definitely see the character of this team come out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, on pace to become the Pac-10 career passing yardage
leader, nearly tied a USC record Saturday for touchdown passes in a
game. But he was denied his fifth touchdown when flanker Keary
Colbert dropped a pass in the end zone in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, well," Palmer said. "It doesn't matter. I'd rather win."</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Peete set the record against Stanford in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A week after tailback Sultan McCullough rushed for 176 yards in 39
carries against California, USC managed only 74 yards rushing in 34
carries. Coach Pete Carroll wasn't entirely disappointed, though,
pointing out that the Trojans succeeded in having a balanced attack.
They attempted 34 passes.</TE>
<TE>   "When you stop trying to run the ball, you're in trouble," Carroll
said.</TE>

<HD>AutoNation Ordered to Pay $130,000 to Fired Salesman</HD>
<DH>Arbitrator says worker was punished for saying customers
were cheated. Company will appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AutoNation Inc. and its Huntington Beach Ford dealership have been
ordered by an arbitrator to pay $130,000 to a former salesman who was
fired after complaining to the Florida-based new-car dealership chain
that customers were being cheated.</LD>
<LD>   AutoNation said it would appeal the award to former car salesman
Bruce Gillies . Spokesman Oscar Suris said the company would have no
comment while the matter was still active, and a spokesman for
Gillies' Irvine-based attorneys said Gillies would not comment.</LD>
<LD>   The award, by an independent arbitrator, was handed down in late
July.</LD>
<TE>   Arbitrator Ricardo A. Torres, a retired Los Angeles County
Superior Court judge, found that Gillies' superiors had punished him
for complaining about deals in which customers' interest rates were
inflated without their knowledge. The award includes $50,000 in
punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   A statement issued on behalf of Gillies' attorneys said an
attorney for AutoNation investigated Gillies' complaints and ordered
an end to the offending practices, reprimanded the dealership's
management and instituted oversight by an AutoNation regional
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The statement added, however, that the company attorney did
nothing to prevent Gillies from being punished and in fact ordered
his dismissal.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Chrysler Workers Approve 3-Year Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Canadian workers for the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler ratified a
three-year contract that increases pay and promises a new plant in
the Windsor, Canada, region.</LD>
<LD>   In a vote over the weekend, 4,904 workers voted in favor of the
contract, with 568 opposing it, said Canadian Auto Workers union
spokeswoman Jane Armstrong. Of production and trades workers, 90%
voted in favor. About 12,500 workers were eligible to vote on the
pact, Armstrong said.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler, North America's third-biggest automaker, agreed to pay
increases of 3% in each of the first two years and 2% in the third
year, in addition to a $635 bonus for each employee and
cost-of-living increases that track inflation. The automaker agreed
to build a production facility worth at least $375 million in the
Windsor area by 2005 to replace a van assembly plant that will close
next year.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler's agreement Tuesday to build the plant averted a strike
by the workers. The deal was announced 25 minutes before the workers
were due to walk off the job.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler said it would need government aid to build the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Stuttgart, Germany-based DaimlerChrysler rose 23 cents
to $36.65 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Corporate America Having Tough Time in Capitol This Year</HD>
<DH>Congress passes accounting crackdown but leaves bankruptcy,
terrorism bills in limbo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Cornwell</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Business lobbyists had trouble finding the welcome mat this year on
Capitol Hill as a string of corporate scandals drove the 107th
Congress to pass the biggest crackdown on executive fraud since the
Great Depression.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers in August gave the White House so-called fast-track
trade negotiating authority backed by most businesses, but industries
including airlines and financial services providers saw Congress
leave key legislation unfinished last week when it adjourned to
campaign for Nov. 5 elections.</LD>
<LD>   Driven by swooning markets and angry investors, Congress cracked
down on shady accounting practices, banned insider loans and
quadrupled jail time for crooked executives in the landmark
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</LD>
<TE>   Congress also humbled major players in corporate scandals,
including those of Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and ImClone Systems
Inc. Executives, accountants, bankers and stock analysts were
investigated, subpoenaed and castigated in packed hearing rooms on
Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Congress still failed to address how to account
for stock options, which may skew the judgment of chief executives.</TE>
<TE>   They also say lawmakers failed to pass legislation to protect
pension plans or to bar U.S. firms from incorporating in offshore
havens to avoid taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Year in and year out, business lobbyists have held enormous sway
over Congress. This year they didn't get their way all of the time,
just much of the time," said Dave Butler, a spokesman for consumer
advocacy group Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   Congress disappointed lenders, insurers, mortgage bankers and
property developers when it came within inches of passing a
bankruptcy law overhaul and terrorism insurance but left both
measures unfinished before leaving town.</TE>
<TE>   The razor-thin political majorities in the Senate and the House
have kept Congress from doing much except in a perceived crisis, said
Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy reform would make it harder for dead-beat borrowers
to use bankruptcy laws to erase debts.</TE>
<TE>   It gained momentum after the Enron scandal highlighted the
potential for executives of failed companies to shield
multimillion-dollar residences from creditors.</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation foundered on a dispute over abortion-related
provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terrorism insurance bill -- backed by insurers,
developers and mortgage bankers -- the government over the next three
years would become the insurer of last resort for damage from a Sept.
11-like attack.</TE>
<TE>   But a dispute over limitations on legal liability held up final
passage.</TE>
<TE>   Still, observers give good odds that Congress will pass both
measures in a post-election "lame duck" session expected in
mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   "The [congressional] leaders say they're committed to passing
these bills. A powerful array of interests is behind both of these
bills," said Travis Plunkett of the Consumer Federation of America,
which opposes the bills.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry, which reported another round of staggering
losses last week, failed to persuade lawmakers to sign off on a new
aid package worth $4 billion a year -- although supporters hope that
this bill can be passed in the lame duck session.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last year, when the industry received a government bailout
that included $5 billion in cash, airlines this time are seeking tax
breaks and help with meeting security costs and premiums for
"war-risk" insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation in both houses would freeze war-risk premiums and lift
some security restrictions to boost revenue. Lawmakers have rejected
pleas by chief executives from big airlines to lift a security tax
imposed this year.</TE>

<HD>Builders of El Paso in a Power Struggle</HD>
<DH>Two men who put together the energy firm clash on
practices, pay</DH>
<SE>First of two parts</SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman and Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Both men are titans, power brokers who laid cornerstones in the
industry that powers America.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, they assembled the pieces of El Paso Corp., a natural
gas and oil empire that, so far, stands as a rare survivor in an
industry in crisis -- the corporation's 33-story headquarters still
abuzz with life amid the wreckage of Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. and
Reliant Resources Inc. here in the heart of America's energy capital.</LD>
<LD>   But now, behind the girders and glass and understated "elpaso"
logo on Louisiana Street, a power struggle is unfolding between the
two men who built the corporation that a federal judge says helped
cause California's energy crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge's recent ruling
that El Paso illegally withheld gas to drive up California's prices
in 2000 and '01 is merely the latest wrinkle in a fierce internal
struggle. One lawyer here called it "a death dance" between the
Iowa-born lawyer who now heads America's biggest natural gas company
and the old Texas wildcatter who built half of it.</TE>
<TE>   On one side is William A. Wise, 58, a competitive and self-assured
executive who is fighting for the very survival of his corporation, a
once-sleepy regional pipeline company on the Mexican border that now
includes oil and gas rigs, refineries, power plants and 58,000 miles
of pipeline from Bakersfield to Boston and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side is Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., 72, a hard-edged South
Texas original who has done business with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Kadafi, bargained with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and helped
rescue hostages in Kuwait in the years before he sold his oil and gas
company, Coastal Corp., to Wise and his shareholders 18 months ago in
a $24-billion deal that doubled El Paso's size.</TE>
<TE>   The deal left Wyatt with nearly 5 million shares of El Paso stock,
but he now says he deeply regrets selling out. On Thursday, he won
court approval here to take the lead in a dozen shareholder lawsuits
that accuse Wise and other top executives of fraud and misconduct,
alleging not only El Paso's role in the California crisis but also
Enron-type trading and accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt, in court papers and in an interview, asserts that since El
Paso bought Coastal, it has mirrored Enron both in style and
substance. He blasts Wise for his multimillion-dollar annual salary,
bonuses and stock options that bought him a palatial retreat in
Aspen, Colo., and a personal fleet of luxury cars; for overuse of the
company's luxury jets and perks; and for corporate loans that bought
him a posh Houston condo.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt also accuses Wise and his senior executives of endangering
some of the company's crucial hard assets through off-the-books
partnerships, which the company's Securities and Exchange Commission
filings show have taken some $2 billion in debt off El Paso's books.
Filings also show that the federal government is investigating some
of El Paso's trading practices, including "wash" trades that were
reminiscent of Enron; El Paso has denied using them.</TE>
<TE>   And Wyatt alleges that El Paso, driven by a desire to compete with
Enron's stratospheric salaries and aggressive accounting, has
fostered a corporate culture of deception, effectively "running the
company in a closet."</TE>
<TE>   "It looks so much like Enron, it's scary," said Wyatt, who owns so
much stock in El Paso that a $1 change in its value alters his net
worth by $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Miller, a former executive at El Paso and Enron who runs a
New York energy investment partnership, cited the company's
off-the-books partnerships in dubbing the company "El Enron." And
David Huard, a Los Angeles-based energy attorney who has represented
El Paso opponents in regulatory proceedings, likened El Paso to "a
dysfunctional family" that has failed to accommodate growth so rapid
that the size of El Paso has doubled three times in the last seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   Wise bristles at such accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been focused on doing what is right for El Paso and
its shareholders and never gave much thought to what was going on" at
Enron, Wise said in a recent interview. He suggested he never wanted
El Paso to emulate Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to analysts here in February, he even blamed Enron for El
Paso's woes.</TE>
<TE>   "Not because we look like Enron or not because we've done anything
like Enron," he said. "It's just because Enron has fouled the nest,
and the financial markets don't have the time to differentiate.
They're just staying away."</TE>
<TE>   Of the high salaries, bonuses and perks, Wise said: "The
challenging times, the difficult times, are what really require you
to earn your keep ... and we're in a difficult time now."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts agree that El Paso, whose debt remains investment
grade even though its stock has lost 87% of its value this year, has
weathered the turbulence of Enron's collapse better than most. El
Paso, along with Dynegy and Williams Cos., is sharply reducing its
energy trading business.</TE>
<TE>   And Wise is far from throwing in the towel. The company has taken
an aggressive stance in its battle with FERC, setting out on a public
relations blitz with full-page newspaper ads and letters to Congress,
and challenging the agency to a six-hour showdown over the judge's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso has said that it cut back on gas flow to California for
safety purposes, and that running gas lines continuously at full
volume can cause explosions such as a 2000 inferno that killed an
extended family of 12 in New Mexico and has been the focus of
numerous civil lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "Requiring a pipeline to operate at or near its maximum allowable
operating pressure on a sustained basis ... is akin to requiring all
motorists to drive at 65 miles an hour at all times, regardless of
road and weather conditions," Wise wrote in a letter to employees and
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   That California has emerged as a key to El Paso's future is apt.
According to thousands of pages of documents on file with federal
agencies in Washington and courthouses in Houston, the Golden State
and its vast yet fluid energy market lie at the very roots of the
company and are the central thread that has run through its 80-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Restructured to Grow</TE>
<TE>   For decades, El Paso's southwestern pipeline monopoly was a money
machine. The company bought gas at the wellhead, processed it, moved
it cross-country through its own pipes and then sold it for steep
profits to the California utilities at the other end. The price,
however, was regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1985, the federal government changed the rules,
allowing utilities to buy directly from gas producers. As a result,
the pipeline companies were rendered little more than railroads that
charged a fee to haul the gas. To grow, El Paso had to restructure,
so Wise mapped out a new corporate strategy of acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole history of the company, that our company was built on,
is expanding into new markets ... continuously looking at accessing
new markets and building new pipe," Wise stated during a 1999 court
deposition in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   That meant growing beyond Southern California, which had become,
at once, El Paso's captive and captivating market. In 1994, El Paso
joined with Enron to form Mojave Pipeline Co. and built new lines
into Northern California. But by the mid-'90s, it was clear that El
Paso had built too much pipeline capacity into a state where growth
was beginning to wane.</TE>
<TE>   So, at a time when growth was synonymous with survival in the
energy game, Wise looked north.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1996, El Paso and Tenneco Inc. signed a merger agreement
that was, for El Paso and its 10,000 miles of pipe, a tectonic shift.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso went national overnight, acquiring $2.5 billion of
Tenneco's debt and tens of thousands of miles of its pipeline.
Instantly, it was "one of the nation's largest natural gas
companies," proclaimed the formal merger prospectus. The $4-billion
deal, it added, "will dramatically expand the size and geographic
scope of El Paso's operations."</TE>
<TE>   The merger created an El Paso Energy Corp. that had a staggering
4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas per year through 33,000 miles of pipe
going to new markets, as Wise put it at the time, "from Bakersfield
to Boston." That's about 20% of the natural gas consumed in the
United States each year.</TE>
<TE>   Almost buried in that document was El Paso Energy's bottom-line
motivation: The merger "will create a coast-to-coast pipeline system
with access to all of the nation's major markets and supply basins
... reducing El Paso's dependence on the California market."</TE>
<TE>   Local analysts were worried that the Tenneco-El Paso marriage of
convenience also was a clash of corporate cultures.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no alternative. The new markets, Wise and others
figured, were El Paso's only future. And the new El Paso Energy board
rewarded him handsomely that year. Setting a lavish tone that would
be harshly criticized years later, El Paso Energy gave Wise a
$1.2-million bonus, along with $3.5 million in stock, and the
$1.5-million loan to buy his new condo in Houston's prestigious River
Oaks area.</TE>
<TE>   Wise selected the 29th floor of the Huntingdon, an elegant, walled
and well-guarded high-rise where, two years before, another emerging
energy czar had moved in four floors up: Enron's Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Similar Strategies</TE>
<TE>   Wise and Lay had more in common than their home addresses. Despite
divergent personalities -- Wise has always been seen around Houston
as conservative compared with the more outgoing Lay -- both chief
executives were aggressive, competitive and locked into
shopping-spree strategies of acquisitions, often launching new buyout
talks before the ink was dry on a previous deal.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Tenneco merger, while Enron was gobbling up energy
companies large and small from its headquarters just down the street,
Wise set his sites on Sonat Inc., another asset-rich, Houston-based
power company. And in another multibillion-dollar deal announced two
years later, Wise again doubled El Paso's size.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, Wise proudly declared: "From approximately $1
billion in assets seven years ago, we have built a company with an
asset value in excess of $15 billion." Wise's reward that year: A
$3.8-million bonus, plus millions more in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he issued that statement, Wise already was a month into
negotiations for the ultimate El Paso buyout -- a mega-billion-dollar
merger that would finally catapult El Paso into Enron's league and,
perhaps, lay the foundations for its ultimate undoing.</TE>
<TE>   Wise's target: Oscar Wyatt's Coastal Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Even by the cutthroat standards of the South Texas gas patch, the
native-born Wyatt was considered cutthroat.</TE>
<TE>   Using plain talk, shrewd instincts and sometimes ruthless tactics,
Wyatt raided and acquired company after company for decades to build
Coastal piece by piece after creating it in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time the El Paso Energy deal crossed his desk in early
2000, Wyatt had been retired as Coastal's chairman for more than two
years. He was still on the company's board, getting $35,500 a month
in Coastal consultant fees, when he signed off on the $24-billion
merger that gave Wise and El Paso Energy his life's work.</TE>
<TE>   "On paper at the outset, it looked like a good deal for the
shareholders and myself," Wyatt recalled. So he traded his stock for
about 5 million El Paso shares and helped clinch the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Over at El Paso Energy, Wise called it "a transforming event."</TE>
<TE>   "Our combination of assets, intellectual capital and financial
resources creates the largest and most broadly based natural gas
company in the world," Wise declared when the deal closed Jan. 29,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   With the merger, which created El Paso Corp., El Paso got
Coastal's power plants, oil and gas fields from the Gulf of Mexico to
Canada and more than 20,000 miles of new pipeline. The new company
also inherited some 7,000 of Wyatt's fiercely loyal employees. And,
soon after the merger, El Paso's stock shot up to its all-time high:
$75 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Wise's reward last year: A $3.4-million bonus on top of a
$1.3-million salary and nearly $250,000 in perks.</TE>
<TE>   But even before the merger was final, El Paso's problems began to
unfold.</TE>
<TE>   At 5:26 a.m. on Aug. 19, 2000, while El Paso and Coastal top
executives were enmeshed in their intensive merger talks in Houston,
disaster struck in El Paso's backyard, at the core of its corporate
foundation. One of the original El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s pipes
ruptured a dozen feet underground 20 miles south of Carlsbad, N.M.
Within minutes it exploded, killing a dozen members of a family
camping nearby.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso has since spent undisclosed millions of dollars settling
the family's claims in and out of court. Federal documents in one of
the remaining suits filed by the family's 70-year-old matriarch,
Geneva Smith, help explain why.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Accusation of Neglect</TE>
<TE>   For half a century, the section of El Paso's Pipeline 1103 that
blew had sat underground, and not once had the company properly
inspected it, according to a National Transportation Safety Board
report issued soon after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, El Paso had been warned of the risks and formally
ordered to make the inspections. Those warnings came after a similar
explosion on a parallel, 50-year-old pipeline near Roswell, N.M., in
1996; El Paso's internal report on the Roswell blast said it was
caused by the same conditions that a preliminary investigation would
later conclude caused the rupture near Carlsbad four years later.</TE>
<TE>   That internal El Paso report was dated September 1996 -- the month
when El Paso was feverishly finalizing the Tenneco merger that first
took the company national. And the explosion in August 2000 came as
the company was closing the Coastal deal that made it a global
powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Geneva Smith said she blames the
company's ambitious growth for the deaths of her son, Bobby, all but
one of her grandchildren and most of her great-grandchildren. The
company was so busy getting big, she said, that it forgot the basics
of when it was small.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't care enough to care for these lines," she said. "They
could have just put a new line down there, and none of this would've
happened."</TE>
<TE>   El Paso had said little publicly about the explosion near the
Pecos River until two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   In an open letter to Congress, Wise invoked the August 2000
rupture in an attempt to refute the recent federal ruling against the
company in relation to California's energy crisis. Wise stated that
El Paso reduced its gas flows to California because the government
ordered it to do so after the explosion, adding, "El Paso has
operated its pipeline safely and prudently."</TE>
<TE>   The implication was clear: El Paso didn't contribute to the energy
crisis by deliberately holding back gas supplies from California, as
Administrative Law Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. ruled last month; the
government did by ordering El Paso to reduce the flows and pressure
inside its lines to California after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department still is investigating the pipeline
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   When Wyatt showed up at the last El Paso shareholders meeting at
the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas on May 20, the company already was the
target of at least five investigations by four federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the probes -- one civil and one criminal -- aim to
determine whether El Paso had a role in California's energy crisis.
Wise asserts that the company is blameless. Excluding the inquiry
into the explosion, the rest of the probes are fallout from Enron,
with investigators zeroing in on some of the very practices Wyatt was
about to expose at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt flew in from Houston with two corporate jets packed with El
Paso shareholders. He had tipped the industry's trade press that he
planned to publicly call for corporate reform. And he staged a news
conference outside the hotel ballroom, after the company barred
reporters from covering the annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt's message: The energy industry in general, and El Paso in
particular, was losing the post-Enron "war for credibility."</TE>
<TE>   "The fate of Enron has shattered the hopes of many shareholders,
employees, customers, lending institutions and others," Wyatt
declared in a speech that cited Enron's off-balance-sheet accounting
and other practices. Then, he leveled both barrels at El Paso's
management, suggesting they were using similar tactics to run the
company "for the personal gain of its officers."</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Wise stressed that El Paso's fundamentals remain
sound, that the firm will be cleared of any wrongdoing in California
on appeal and that El Paso still "drills more wells ... and moves
more gas through our pipelines than anyone else in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Of Wyatt's crusade, Wise said his 5 million shares are dwarfed by
the 600 million shares of El Paso that are outstanding. "I work for
all the shareholders," he said flatly. "I'm not spending a lot of
time or energy worrying about what Mr. Wyatt may or may not be
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt's response: "If I can cause this company to go back to
basics of the business it is in ... to come clean on how they have
been running it and to do all this with transparency, then they can
resume as a credible company.</TE>
<TE>   "Without this, they never will. Until then, I just pray for the
thousands of families whose pensions and retirements depend on it."</TE>

<HD>Bulls See Hope in Latest Stock Rally</HD>
<DH>But others are skeptical of the two-week surge. Prices have
burst higher several times in the last 2 1/2 years, only to sink
again in steep sell-offs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman and Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two winning weeks for the stock market, a growing chorus of
bulls is being heard on Wall Street. But skeptics say it's a song
they've heard before.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than 1,000 points, or
14%, from the five-year low it hit Oct. 9, closing Friday at
8,322.40. Bolstered by robust earnings reports from several blue-chip
companies last week, the Dow and the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index scored their biggest weekly percentage gains in more than a
year.</LD>
<LD>   "For the first time in years, equities are more compelling than
fixed income," said Harvey Hirschhorn, head of asset allocation at
Columbia Management in Boston. He recently shifted his recommended
weighting toward stocks and away from bonds. He believes that the
long slump in stock prices makes equities a good buy relative to
Treasury securities, which had rallied as investors -- until recently
-- fled to the safety of fixed income.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas McManus, strategist at Banc of America Securities in New
York, also recently recommended that investors shift money from bonds
to stocks, saying his hunch is that stocks have seen their lows for
2002 and that key indexes could climb 10% to 20% in the next six
months.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even a solid fourth-quarter rally would not necessarily spell
the end of the bear market. Stock prices have burst higher several
times over the last 2 1/2 years, only to fall victim to steep
sell-offs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rallied 17.5% from July 24 through Aug. 22 before fading,
for example. And after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it surged
24.6% before fizzling and eventually plunging to new five-year lows.
Even with its recent gains, the blue-chip barometer is down 17%
year-to-date and 29% from its all-time high during 2000 -- and the
S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes have tumbled harder.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not looking a gift horse in the mouth," strategist Kent
Engelke of Andersen &amp; Strudwick Inc. told Reuters after last week's
gains. "But we think the recent rally was excessive. Sharp rallies of
this fashion are the hallmarks of bear markets."</TE>
<TE>   Economic data remain lukewarm overall, analysts note, and the
potential for war with Iraq has rattled the nerves of pros and
individual investors alike.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, after being burned several times during the bear market,
investors are wary.</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of four months of net outflows from stock mutual
funds, an additional $9 billion has been withdrawn so far in October,
including $4 billion in the week ended Wednesday, said Bob Adler,
president of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., which estimates
fund cash flows.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have been chastened," Adler said. "It's surprising to
me that the enthusiasm that has been there with every rally of the
past 10 years simply isn't there this time."</TE>
<TE>   That trend is evident in conversations with some Southern
California investors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared of the stock market," said Damon Freeman, 37, an
unemployed aerospace engineer in Los Angeles. "We've had these short
market rallies in the past: It jumps up, then it jumps right back
down again."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Bernstein, 62, an accountant in Century City, is equally
leery: "All these rallies are points in the downward curve, because
the market is still overvalued."</TE>
<TE>   Sara Hammes, 38, who works at a Los Angeles marketing firm, said
she is "just trying to figure out how to get out of the stock market.
It's paying so little, I'd just rather take the losses and have my
money in cash."</TE>
<TE>   The latest rally has sparked some hope, however.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's membership survey by the American Assn. of Individual
Investors showed a rise in near-term bullishness. Bulls and bears
were even at 39% each, with the rest neutral, just a week after
bearishness had zoomed to a 10-year high of 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Some strategists say the pessimism exemplified by recent fund
flows and investor surveys could be seen as positive from a
contrarian standpoint, indicating a climax in selling that might set
the stage for buyers to wrest control.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things the bottom in July didn't have is the pervasive
pessimism that often accompanies the ultimate low," said Liz Ann
Sonders, portfolio manager at Campbell, Cowperthwait in New York.
"This time we've seen that pessimism."</TE>
<TE>   The public is understandably "skeptical about the sustainability
of the economic recovery and the validity of earnings," Sonders
added, nodding to the wave of corporate scandals in the last year.
"But eventually that sustainability and validity will be proven."</TE>
<TE>   Strong earnings reports from IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. were
encouraging, she said. IBM shares got an 11% lift Thursday after the
company reported a jump in third-quarter sales, and Microsoft rose 5%
Friday after the software giant raised profit forecasts for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 209 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings
for the last quarter, 61% beat analysts' estimates and the average
year-over-year gain was 6.4%, according to Thomson First Call, the
Boston-based earnings tracker.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the recent brace of positive news hardly signals an
all-clear in the eyes of investor Allan Spring, 45, a computer
programmer in Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling optimistic, but I'm trying not to get too committed
to the idea," Spring said. "Every time I say, 'OK, it can't get any
lower,' something else happens and down it goes."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Using Kazaa as a Marketing Portal</HD>
<DH>Firm pushes legitimate use of the file-sharing network,
distributing promo videos for other companies and showing off its
Media 9 format.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In early September, Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates staged a
Hollywood gala to impress the recording and movie industries with his
company's latest software for digital music and video, Windows Media
9.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks later, Microsoft started showing off Windows Media 9
to an audience reviled by the entertainment industry: the Kazaa
file-sharing network, where users routinely copy digital songs, films
and software free.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft has picked up the tab to distribute at least two
companies' promotional videos on Kazaa in the Windows Media 9 format,
representatives of those companies say. The videos not only show off
the improved picture quality of Microsoft's latest technology; they
also help distribute it. When Kazaa users download and play either
video, their Microsoft media player software is automatically
upgraded to Windows Media 9.</LD>
<TE>   The dalliance with Kazaa seems risky, given the network's
reputation for promoting piracy. But to Microsoft, the projects serve
a legitimate purpose: to show the entertainment industry how the
anti-piracy features of Windows Media 9 might tame the file-sharing
beast.</TE>
<TE>   The videos were put on the Kazaa network by Altnet, a Los
Angeles-based company that uses Microsoft's digital-rights-management
software to place electronic locks on the songs and videos it
distributes. Those locks deter unauthorized copying, enabling
companies to take advantage of the virtually free distribution
provided by Kazaa without losing the ability to demand payment and
limit usage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really interested in how peer-to-peer networks can be used
for the legitimate distribution of content," said Jonathan Usher,
director of Microsoft's Windows Media division.</TE>
<TE>   A key question, Usher said, is whether Kazaa users will download
an authorized, copy-protected Altnet file instead of songs and videos
with no copy protection.</TE>
<TE>   So far, "the number of [authorized] downloads has been pretty
promising and actually has been surprisingly high," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Altnet also helps Microsoft compete with other software companies
in the burgeoning field of digital audio and video. Microsoft's goal
is to make Windows Media the dominant format, but it has been
overshadowed on popular file-sharing networks by industry-standard
formats, such as MP3 for music. And for online movie trailers,
Hollywood studios have favored the QuickTime video format from Apple
Computer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm, said Kazaa gives Microsoft a low-cost way to show
media companies a variety of benefits that Windows Media 9 offers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McNealy added, "This smacks of a government wanting to do
legitimate business with a known drug dealer.... I'm as surprised at
Microsoft wanting to work with Kazaa as Bertelsmann wanting to work
with Napster."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann, the global media conglomerate that owns the BMG
recording and music-publishing companies, funneled more than $85
million to Napster Inc. before the pioneering file-sharing network
shut down. A group of creditors recently sued Bertelsmann, claiming
it sustained Napster's copyright infringements.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paying for Distribution</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has paid Altnet an undisclosed sum to distribute
promotional videos for Tony Hawk's Boom Boom HuckJam -- a touring
extravaganza of skateboarding, cycling and punk rock -- and "The
Rules of Attraction," a film by Lions Gate Entertainment, an
independent studio in Marina del Rey. In addition to an upfront fee
to start the distribution, Altnet charges Microsoft every time one of
the videos is downloaded -- a fee that it splits with the company
behind Kazaa, Sharman Networks Ltd. of Vanuatu, a tax haven in the
South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The major film and music companies are suing Sharman and other
companies involved with the Kazaa software, accusing them of aiding
copyright infringement on a massive scale. Sharman contends that its
software has legitimate uses, adding that the company is not liable
for what consumers do on the network.</TE>
<TE>   A good illustration of how Microsoft uses Kazaa to promote its
format is the eight-minute promotional video for the Boom Boom
HuckJam tour, a production of Mission Viejo-based Tony Hawk Inc.
Craig Sneiderman, the tour's promoter, said the video was posted on
the tour's Web site in QuickTime format and sent to sporting goods
stores, but he wanted an inexpensive way to reach a much wider
audience.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he wanted to use Altnet to reach the tens of
millions of consumers on Kazaa. When the show's backers refused to
cover Altnet's fees, Sneiderman's fellow promoter, Mike McGinley,
turned to Microsoft, which agreed to cover the costs of distributing
a Windows Media version of the video.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft even bought ads on Kazaa to promote the Boom Boom
HuckJam video, said Sharman spokeswoman Kelly Larabee.</TE>
<TE>   The Altnet projects pose at least two risks for entertainment
companies: They encourage consumers to use Kazaa by making
high-quality videos available there, and they bolster the arguments
by Sharman's lawyers that the network has a substantial legitimate
use.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's an excellent example of the growing commercial uses
of peer-to-peer technology," Larabee said of Microsoft's work.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, a lawyer close to the Hollywood studios said
the projects may be a boon to their lawsuit against Sharman. Contrary
to the company's claims that it can't control infringements on the
network, the source said, the Microsoft videos show "you can run a
peer-to-peer system and protect copyrights."</TE>

<HD>Xcel May Cut Value of NRG Assets</HD>
<DH>Parent firm's report on third-quarter earnings excludes
results from troubled subsidiary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xcel Energy Inc. on Sunday said it expects to report a $2-billion
third-quarter write-down of assets at its wholesale power-generating
unit, NRG Energy.</LD>
<LD>   NRG has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy since July, when a
downgrade in the company's credit rating triggered a requirement that
NRG post up to $1.3 billion in cash collateral for its main line of
credit.</LD>
<LD>   NRG has about $9 billion in total debt.</LD>
<TE>   "We are aggressively addressing the financial difficulties facing
NRG and are continuing to make progress," said Wayne H. Brunetti,
Xcel's chairman, president and chief executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, bankers and other lenders of NRG gave it more time to
convert about $1 billion in assets to cash, which it was forced to
raise as collateral after a downgrade to its credit rating in July
triggered tighter restrictions in its borrowing agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Its stock closed Friday down 21 cents at $9.02 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   NRG has until Nov. 15 to come up with the cash. That's more than
three months after the original mid-August deadline and two months
after its first extension.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, NRG missed a deadline to pay $25 million in
principal and interest to owners of some of its bonds. And earlier
this month, it missed a $47-million payment on $800 million in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, Minneapolis-based Xcel reported third-quarter
earnings, excluding NRG's operations, of $174 million, or 44 cents
per share.</TE>
<TE>   The mean forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was
for earnings of 52 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Xcel earned $167 million, or 48 cents per share, in the same
period a year earlier, excluding NRG.</TE>
<TE>   Xcel also excluded "all effects of NRG" in its forecast to earn
from $1.45 to $1.55 per share in 2002. Analysts were expecting $1.52
per share.</TE>
<TE>   The company's electric utility operations had sales of $1.56
billion in the third quarter, down from $1.89 billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   NRG would be included in Xcel's final third-quarter earnings after
the Minneapolis-based subsidiary is reviewed Nov. 14 and NRG presents
a restructuring plan to creditors by the end of October.</TE>
<TE>   For its utilities, Xcel reported earnings of $196 million, or 49
cents per share, compared with $182 million, or 53 cents, for third
quarter 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Xcel spun off NRG as a separate company in 2000, believing it
would help the company raise money from investors to fuel its growth.
But investors soured on independent producers.</TE>
<TE>   Xcel bought back the public stake in NRG in June and said it would
scale back NRG operations, particularly overseas.</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Seeks Arbitration of Lawsuit by Ex-Employee</HD>
<DH>The mogul accuses the former president of his film unit of
being an ineffectual executive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Ovitz has gone on the offensive against a $4-million lawsuit
filed earlier this month by an ex-employee and accused the former
president of his company's film division of being an ineffectual
executive.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
the former head of the now-defunct Artists Management Group sought to
have the court move to resolve the dispute with former employee Cathy
Schulman through binding arbitration. A hearing on his motion is
scheduled for Nov. 13.</LD>
<LD>   Schulman's attorney Randy Sunshine said he found Ovitz's position
hard to believe. "He praised her on national television and now that
he gets sued, ... she's a bad employee."</LD>
<TE>   Schulman sued Ovitz; his company's film unit, Artists Production
Group; and the unit's financier Vivendi Universal's StudioCanal, on
Oct. 7, alleging wrongful termination, breach of contract and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz was forced to sell Artists Management Group in May after
StudioCanal backed out. A Vivendi audit had raised questions about
how some $2 million had been spent.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman's lawsuit contends that after Ovitz found out that she
had spoken to auditors and had relayed suspicions about possible
misuse of funds, Ovitz fired her on Feb. 14. Ovitz maintains that
Schulman resigned Jan. 3 and that he allowed her to stay after her
resignation as a courtesy, but on Feb. 14 "in the face of continued
interference and disruption ... and in light of Schulman's confused
assertion that she had not, in fact, resigned," she was terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz also contends that Schulman failed in her job.</TE>

<HD>Little Gain Seen in Patent Filings</HD>
<DH>The number of applications rose less than 2% in fiscal
2002. Experts worry that business is showing diminished ability to
dream up new ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of applications for U.S. patents is barely growing,
raising concern that a falloff in innovation may hurt the nation's
economy in general and California's high-tech sector in particular.</LD>
<LD>   Patent applications -- a key predictor of compelling products in
the pipeline -- had been growing at double-digit rates since the
mid-1990s. But in fiscal 2002, which ended Sept. 30, the number of
patent applications was about 350,000, less than a 2% increase over
the roughly 345,000 applications filed in fiscal 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Patents grant inventors special property rights that give them
legal protection to profit from their ideas. A surge in patents
helped fuel business productivity gains and rapid economic growth in
the late 1990s, especially in the technology sector.</LD>
<TE>   But now, experts worry that business is showing diminished ability
to dream up new ideas -- and that could undermine the nation's
already anemic economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies will increase research and development spending by
just 3.2% this year, according to a study by the nonprofit research
foundation Battelle Memorial Institute and R&amp;D Magazine. In 2000,
when the "new economy" was humming, businesses boosted their R&amp;D
budgets by 10.8%.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a lot of money floating around for R&amp;D to spur
innovation," said Rob Enderle, a technology analyst for Santa Clara
research firm Giga Information Group. "That's why a lot of financial
forecasts put the economic recovery as far out as 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Experts don't believe that the country is on the verge of a
long-term creative blackout. Rather, they say patent applications may
simply be undergoing a periodic lull, returning to the patterns of
the 1960s and 1970s when applications grew more slowly than the
economy or the population as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   There remains in the system a backlog of 420,000 patent
applications from previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the meager growth in new applications worries James
E. Rogan, a former Southern California congressman who now leads the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</TE>
<TE>   "The slowdown concerns us," Rogan said. "We aren't sure why" it's
happening.</TE>
<TE>   Anecdotal evidence of lackluster innovation isn't hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   The creative wave in Silicon Valley that produced the first
commercial Web browsers and quantum leaps in computing seems to have
petered out. As a result, many businesses and consumers have lost
their enthusiasm for buying high-tech gadgets.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is happening to the desktop computer, and people in the
computer industry are flat-out freaking out," said Michael Erbschloe,
a senior research analyst at Computer Economics Inc., a Carlsbad
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The computer you bought two or three years ago will do the same
things you need done today," he said. "Until we can talk to PCs and
have a voice interface -- that would be the next big breakthrough.
But that's years, if not decades, off."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the lack of big advances in cars is one reason drivers
are less prone to trade in their vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers now hold on to their cars an average of nine years,
compared with 7.6 years in 1990, according to Ward's Communications,
a publishing firm in Southfield, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Many compelling features -- such as power steering, climate
control systems, catalytic converters and anti-lock brakes -- were
conceived decades ago and haven't been matched by comparable
breakthroughs in recent years, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Engineers are now just tweaking stuff, like adding electronics"
to existing mechanical functions, said Richard A. Lentinello, an
automotive historian and executive editor of Hemmings Motor News in
Bennington, Vt. "The whole idea of creating new engineering marvels
has just gone downhill -- at least until we create a car that can
levitate."</TE>
<TE>   Many good ideas, of course, are never scrutinized by the patent
office and are developed without formal legal protection. But patents
underlie many of the country's most important industries, including
software and pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   IBM Corp., the leading recipient of U.S. patents since 1993,
earned $1.5 billion in revenue last year from licensing its patents
and other intellectual property.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a broad sense now" that patents play "an important role
in the economy," said John Lerner, an economist at Harvard Business
School who studies the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Patent applications began a steady, 15-year climb in the
mid-1980s, when the federal courts allowed inventors to patent not
only new products but also the processes for distributing and selling
them.</TE>
<TE>   Among the flood of so-called business method patents acquired in
the wake of the court rulings were Amazon.com Inc.'s controversial
"one-click" shopping system and Priceline.com Inc.'s patent for
"reverse auctions" on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   But after a public outcry that such inventions were simple
variations of existing technology, the patent office has been
subjecting business method applications to stricter scrutiny. The
more extensive reviews have lengthened the already slow process of
evaluating patent applications.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that when it comes to patents, it's quality,
not quantity, that matters.</TE>
<TE>   "These low-quality patents discourage innovation," said James
Bessen, visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
whose research shows software R&amp;D fell in the wake of court rulings
in the 1980s that extended patent protection.</TE>
<TE>   "The patent office now has very little incentive to reject
patents" because the government earns lucrative renewal fees from
successful patent applicants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, Bessen added, that hurts the economy and innovation in the
long run because patent holders with marginal innovations often use
their property rights to thwart real breakthroughs by new inventors.</TE>
<TE>   Rogan agrees that the patent office can improve its review
process, but he denies that his office has a financial incentive to
give applicants an easy ride. "We already have a huge backlog of
applications," Rogan said.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of the slowdown in patent-application growth, some
firms are stepping up efforts to stoke the creative juices of their
scientists and engineers.</TE>
<TE>   IBM offers annual incentives totaling as much as $100,000 to
encourage its researchers to pursue patents. And other big companies,
such as Hewlett-Packard Co., are fine-tuning financial and workplace
incentives they hope will boost the number of company patent
applications by 50% to 100%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing our best to continue to keep that pipeline filled,"
said Jerry Rosenthal, vice president of intellectual property and
licensing at IBM, which has set up a computer network to link its
engineers, patent attorneys and other experts to help develop new
ideas. "There are still a lot of good ideas out there."</TE>

<HD>Radio Industry's Discomfort Grows Over Payola-Like Practice</HD>
<DH>As labels slash payments to independent promoters, some
broadcasters ponder whether to continue deals with middlemen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suffering from poor sales, major record labels continue to slash the
payments they make to a coterie of middlemen hired to push songs to
radio programmers, leaving Clear Channel Communications Inc. and
other broadcasters trying to figure out where to go from here in the
murky business of record promotion.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the record-label cutbacks, so-called independent
promoters are finding themselves increasingly in a squeeze: They have
signed contracts promising to pay annual fees of $200,000 or more to
major radio stations for the exclusive right to pitch songs, but
their main source of money is drying up.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio-based Clear Channel, the nation's biggest radio
broadcaster, was notified last week that one firm, Tri-State
Promotions of Cincinnati, could no longer afford promotional fees it
had guaranteed to the conglomerate's major pop stations, including
Los Angeles' KIIS-FM, New York's WHTZ-FM, San Francisco's KYLD-FM and
Miami's WHYI-FM, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   It was unclear whether Clear Channel would seek to renegotiate
promotional deals for the stations, which rank among the richest and
most influential in pop music.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel declined to comment. Tri-State also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The development comes as radio broadcasters and federal agencies
are trying to determine whether tactics by independent promoters
violate payola laws, which prohibit radio stations from playing songs
in exchange for money or anything of value without disclosing the
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   The middlemen provide stations with annual fees, often prorated
and paid monthly. In exchange, the promoters are to receive notice of
new songs added to the station's playlist, so as to take credit for
pushing the tune onto the air. Each time a song is added, the
promoter charges the record label. But the promoters insist publicly
that the fees they pay to radio stations are not tied to airplay of
specific songs.</TE>
<TE>   Record labels have complained to the Federal Communications
Commission about big broadcasting chains using their muscle to demand
increasing payments for promotion.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three months, major labels have cut their payments
by as much as 50% and reduced the number of stations nationwide for
which promoters are able to collect fees for pitching songs, sources
said. Universal Music Group, the world's biggest record company,
reduced its payments to promoters this summer, starting the trend.</TE>
<TE>   Several labels, including Universal, have refused to pay Tri-State
for songs that are added to playlists at Clear Channel's big
stations, sources said. Label executives say the middlemen are losing
their influence as more stations are swallowed up by large
conglomerates in the deregulated radio market.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just the record labels that are having second
thoughts about the use of middlemen: Broadcasters are also
reconsidering their side of these relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Emmis Communications Corp., owner of Los Angeles' top-ranked
KPWR-FM, plans to call a meeting of its senior managers this week to
debate whether the Indianapolis-based radio chain should continue its
deals with independent promoters.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll ask the question," Emmis President Rick Cummings said. "I
will tell you honestly, I sometimes have a hard time explaining what
our stations really do to earn that money."</TE>
<TE>   The growing discomfort throughout the radio industry follows a
decision by Atlanta-based Cox Radio Inc. to sever its ties to
promoters, as reported Friday in The Times. As a result of the move,
Cox will not renew deals with the promoters who pitch songs to its
pop, rap and rock stations. Cox Radio chief Robert Neil said the
existing independent promotion system "does invite abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The decision means Cox will end its deals with New York-based
independent promoter Skip Bishop, who had arrangements, and in some
cases written contracts, to pitch songs to six of the company's
stations, sources said. Chicago's Jeff McClusky has had promotional
deals with two Cox stations and Boston's Jerry Brenner had a deal
with one. Bishop couldn't be reached, and McClusky and Brenner
declined to comment on Cox's move.</TE>
<TE>   Various middlemen had deals with 14 of Cox's stations and together
provided an estimated $1 million in annual fees to the company. Cox
said promoters' deals to pitch songs to a handful of the company's
other stations lapsed several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to Cox's move in the radio and record industries has been
mixed. Proponents say the move is a step toward cleaning up a sector
of the business that is rife with corruption.</TE>
<TE>   But other radio and music executives said terminating the
independent promotion deals will drive the scramble for airplay deep
underground. They caution that it could lead to music executives
secretly offering cash or other incentives directly to programmers,
instead of providing contracted fees to stations.</TE>
<TE>   Some radio executives say the existing promotional structure
remains viable.</TE>
<TE>   "We have total confidence in the system as it's set up. We are
comfortable with it," said Lew Dickey, chief executive of Cumulus
Media Inc., an Atlanta-based company that owns about 240 radio
stations around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dickey added, "If it were up to us, there would be no
independent promotion relationships. The record labels would buy
commercials on our radio stations to promote their products
directly."</TE>

<HD>Port Mediators to Tour Sites in L.A., Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Walk-throughs to give a better understanding of the issues,
equipment involved in the contract negotiations could begin as early

<LD>Federal mediators may begin touring terminals in the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach as early as today, the latest effort in
settling a labor dispute between West Coast dockworkers and their
employers.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for both sides said Sunday that the tours probably would
be conducted separately, so that mediators would have a better
understanding of the issues and equipment involved in the contract
negotiations. The mediators are expected to complete the
walk-throughs before calling both sides back to the bargaining table
this week.</LD>
<LD>   Ports from San Diego to Seattle are open under an 80-day federal
injunction after the Pacific Maritime Assn.'s lockout froze
transpacific trade for 10 days.</LD>
<TE>   But more than 200 container vessels remain backed up along the
coast, and International Longshore and Warehouse Union spokesman
Steve Stallone said little progress has been made in reducing the
logjam since ports reopened Oct. 9. He cited a shortage of empty
containers and truck trailers as one example of the chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly congested out there," Stallone said, noting that
trucks still are arriving at terminal gates with containers that
should have been shipped out weeks ago on vessels that are no longer
there.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've made much of a dent in the backlog at all."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Stallone said, many dockworkers expect the PMA, which
is representing the cargo carriers and terminal operators, to take
court action this week, accusing them of orchestrating a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   PMA spokesman Steve Sugerman said he doubted that such action
would occur this week but declined to elaborate. The shipping group
could present evidence of a slowdown to the U.S. attorney's office,
which could then seek sanctions against the union and its leaders,
including fines or jail sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not made any new progress, and we don't know what the
next day or week holds," Sugerman said. "It'd be inappropriate for me
to speculate at this time."</TE>
<TE>   The sides have been in talks for five months, unable to agree on
how to introduce job-cutting technology at the terminals.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's Leftist Appears Set to Win Presidency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a week before Brazil's presidential runoff, the victory of
leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva looked all but inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   Recent opinion polls leave little doubt the world's fourth-largest
democracy is poised Sunday to elect its first working-class
president. Lula, a former metalworker and union leader, is making his
fourth try for the presidency.</LD>
<LD>   A survey by Datafolha pollsters published over the weekend showed
support for the 57-year-old Lula, as the Workers' Party candidate is
popularly known, rising to 66% from 64% among respondents planning to
cast valid votes. Centrist candidate Jose Serra, 60, slipped to 34%
from 36%.</LD>
<TE>   In the first round of presidential voting Oct. 6, Lula won 46% to
Serra's 23%. A runoff became necessary because no candidate got a
majority.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent response to Serra's claims that he has no concrete
economic solutions, Lula has shifted away from his highly emotional
campaigning style in the last few days and presented proposals to
voters and financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   A pledge to stick to prudent economic policies and help revitalize
capital markets calmed jittery markets last week, pummeled for months
by investor fears that Lula would backtrack on outgoing President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's free-market reforms and drive the world's
No. 9 economy to default on its $260-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   Market players say Lula's victory has been largely priced in and
they only await details of his program and government.</TE>

<HD>Economic Data May Hint at Slower Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic reports this week are expected to show that the U.S.
economic recovery is losing steam as consumer confidence dropped and
businesses placed fewer orders.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer confidence has fallen this month to the lowest level in
nine years, a survey due Friday from the University of Michigan
probably will show. On the same day, a report from the Commerce
Department is expected to show that orders for durable goods,
big-ticket items meant to last at least three years such as cars,
computers and appliances, fell for a third time in the last four
months.</LD>
<LD>   Waning consumer and business demand means growth probably will
slow in the final three months of the year, economists said.
Companies including Gateway Inc., the fourth-biggest maker of
personal computers, cut sales and earnings forecasts last week.</LD>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for
October is expected to sink to 81, the lowest level since September
1993, from 86.1 last month, according to economists.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses are ordering less as sales flag. Durable goods orders
in September are expected to drop 1.8% after a 0.4% decline the
previous month. Excluding transportation equipment, orders probably
fell 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market, although strong, has probably peaked, two
other reports are expected to show Friday. New-home sales probably
fell 0.6% to an annual rate of 990,000 last month from a record
996,000 in August, economists said a Commerce Department report
probably would show.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the National Assn. of Realtors is expected
to show that previously owned homes sold at an annual rate of 5.35
million in September. Although up 1.3% from the previous month, sales
are off the record-setting 6.05-million pace reached in January.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve's "beige book," an anecdotal report card on
regional economic conditions due out Wednesday, is expected to
support expectations that the recovery may be stalling.</TE>
<TE>   The report will acknowledge "the slowing in activity and the mixed
performance" of the economy, said Joseph Abate, a senior economist at
Lehman Bros. Inc. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers will use information from the beige book to base
their decisions on the direction of interest rates when they next
meet Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of the economy's
performance over the next three to six months, probably declined for
a fourth straight month in September, falling 0.2%, economists said.
The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, will report on
the indicators today.</TE>

<HD>Sale of Vivendi Unit Could Face a Delay</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's plans to sell its publishing unit may be delayed
by a group of French publishers protesting that if Lagardere's bid
wins, France's No. 2 media company will have a near-monopoly on book
publishing, the Financial Times reported without identifying a
source.</LD>
<LD>   French newspaper Le Monde ran an open letter addressed to Jean-Luc
Lagardere, the company's chief executive, and signed by 22 domestic
publishers who promise to appeal to antitrust regulators if Lagardere
emerges as the winner, the Financial Times said.</LD>
<LD>   Lagardere said that if its bid for some of Vivendi's publishing
assets were successful, the company would resell those units posing
competition problems.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi, under pressure to sell assets to lower debt, has rejected
three offers of $3 billion for its publishing unit as too low, people
familiar with the situation said last month.</TE>

<LD>A European Union court decision in two competition cases this week

cries for reforms to slice its control over corporate mergers.</LD>
<LD>   Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, already stung by one
negative decision this year, will learn if the Court of First

ban on privately owned Tetra Laval, the world's largest packaging

law to weaken the power of commission officials.</TE>

<HD>IBM to Unveil Plans for Self-Fixing Systems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. this week will unveil to its 500 largest customers plans to
broaden its efforts to develop computer systems that not only manage
but also fix themselves when they break.</LD>
<LD>   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said it is creating a separate division,
which it calls Autonomic Computing, that will integrate its efforts
to create computer systems that need less human intervention.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the software division, the unit also will work on
standardizing those efforts to work with software programs from other
companies.</LD>
<TE>   The move is part of a broader goal IBM has of bringing computing
to customers on demand, said Nick Donofrio, IBM senior vice president
of technology and manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   IBM launched an autonomic computing initiative in its research
division in the spring of 2001, aiming to bring some of the
traditional characteristics of mainframe computing to other, less
expensive systems.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the heads of IBM's computer, software and data storage
businesses will discuss the plan when they meet with chief
information officers for three days in Desert Hot Springs.</TE>
<TE>   With technology budgets expected to increase only a few percentage
points in 2002 after having fallen in 2001, IBM said it aims to save
customers money by decreasing the number of people needed to manage
and fix complex computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Ganek, an IBM veteran who previously was in charge of
strategy for IBM Research, will head the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Part of his job will be getting customers more comfortable with
letting computers come up with advice on how they can be used better,
and then enabling those systems to take that advice without the
go-ahead from technology workers, he said.</TE>

<HD>Brokerage Merger Talks Are Reported</HD>
<DH>Prudential Financial and Wachovia are in preliminary
discussions to combine units and form an independent business,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Prudential Financial Inc. and Wachovia Corp. are discussing ways to
combine their brokerage units and create one of the world's largest
independent stock research and advisory operations, sources familiar
with the situation said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The talks, which are in their preliminary stages, would combine
the two brokerage operations under a joint venture boasting more than
13,500 brokers, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Several important details, including management, ownership stakes
and what resources each side would commit to such a venture, are
being negotiated, and talks could fall apart any time, the sources
cautioned.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Prudential, the No. 2 U.S. life insurer, declined
to comment. A spokeswoman for Wachovia, the No. 4 U.S. retail bank,
could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement would mark the first significant step by any U.S.
financial institution to establish an independent brokerage business
since regulators began investigating several Wall Street firms,
including Wachovia. The investigations concern allegations that the
firms provided favorable research for clients in exchange for more
lucrative investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement also would address problems for both institutions.
Prudential Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur Ryan has stressed
repeatedly this year that he would explore ways to make the brokerage
business more profitable as part of an overall effort to restructure.</TE>
<TE>   Despite already boasting a sizable independent brokerage unit,
Prudential has experienced difficulty expanding the operation
recently as volatile market conditions have kept many investors on
the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in Newark, N.J., has quietly tried to sell the
operation, said several investment banking sources. However, it found
few willing or capable buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Wachovia, meanwhile, is one of more than a dozen firms being
probed by regulators and is eager to put the issue behind it, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   The bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., is still digesting its
acquisition of First Union Corp. last year, making an outright
acquisition of Prudential's brokerage unit difficult, banking sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the joint venture structure would still provide enough
separation to allow the bank to more aggressively market its
investment banking business, which is dwarfed by other large U.S.
retail banks.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, the two brokerage units would boast a size rivaled only
by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</TE>

<HD>Siebel Pact Would Boost Microsoft's .Net</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Siebel Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are expected to announce an
alliance today that may benefit Microsoft's .Net strategy for the
sharing of data between computers, hand-held devices and cell phones,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Siebel Chief Executive Tom
Siebel will deliver keynote speeches at Siebel's user conference in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft is the world's largest software maker, and Siebel is the
world's largest maker of software to track sales and automate
customer service.</LD>
<TE>   Siebel is expected to say that it will make its software programs
run on the .Net system, which competes with software based on the
Java programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Siebel's endorsement of .Net, much of which still hasn't been
introduced, would help Microsoft as it tries to persuade large
companies to run more of their business programs on Microsoft
software, the analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications of this announcement are clearly positive to
Microsoft, who benefits from the endorsement of its enterprise
platform by a tier 1 application vendor," Credit Suisse First Boston
analysts George Gilbert and Brent Thill wrote in a note to clients
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft probably will work with Siebel on its Universal
Application Network initiative, which is designed to reduce the time
it takes to link different software programs, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray analyst Tad Piper wrote in a note to clients.</TE>
<TE>   Siebel is trying to expand into new markets to make up for
flagging demand for its customer-service software.</TE>
<TE>   The San Mateo, Calif.-based company Thursday reported its first
quarterly loss in four years. It also said its sales declined 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Siebel spokeswoman Stacey Wueste and Microsoft spokesman Sean
Sundwall declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Investors and analysts had speculated that Redmond, Wash.-based
Microsoft would buy a stake in Siebel or purchase the company
outright.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Siebel told analysts Thursday that Microsoft isn't planning to
buy Siebel or acquire a stake.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares, which have fallen 20% this year, rose $2.38 to
close at $53.15 Friday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Siebel fell $1.10, or 15%, to $6.20 Friday, also on
Nasdaq. They have fallen 78% this year.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cities Suffering From Tourism Slump</HD>
<DH>Report blames sluggish economy and lingering effects of
Sept. 11 for losses. Officials say it may take three more years for
L.A. to recover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sluggish economy and the effect on travelers' psyches of last
year's terrorist attacks resulted in the loss of nearly $2 billion in
international visitor spending and 34,000 tourism-related jobs in Los
Angeles over the last two years, according to a study of U.S. cities
that have large tourism industries.</LD>
<LD>   The report, commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the
Travel Business Roundtable and the International Assn. of Convention
and Visitor Bureaus, found that Los Angeles ranked third, behind New
York and Chicago, in terms of such losses.</LD>
<LD>   While local tourism officials have noted a slight rebound in
hiring in some sectors of the travel industry, many expect it to take
an additional three years before Los Angeles returns to levels set in
2000, when records for spending and hiring were broken.</LD>
<TE>   "The forecast is not very positive for us right now," Michael
Collins, executive vice president of the Los Angeles Convention &amp;
Visitors Bureau, said recently. "It's going to take us longer to
recover than we ever imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Overall tourism spending in Los Angeles is expected to be $11.6
billion this year, down from $13.6 billion in 2000, because of a
slump in business and leisure travel after last year's Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. The city is believed to have lost $1.8 billion in
spending by international tourists over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in foreign tourists hurt some places more than others,
according to the report. Of the 30 cities hardest hit by the travel
downturn since Sept. 11, six are in California: San Francisco, Los
Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Anaheim and Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco ranked second, behind New York, with an estimated
loss of $1.2 billion this year directly attributable to the effect of
Sept. 11. The city has lost about 22,000 tourism-related jobs over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism job losses have also been severe in San Diego, where 24%
of industry jobs have been cut since 2000. The city ranked third,
behind Phoenix and Orlando, Fla., in terms of jobs lost, the report
found.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the study reaffirms the need for federal help in
selling the United States as a travel destination to international
visitors. The U.S. is the third-most visited country behind France
and Spain, according to the Conference of Mayors.</TE>
<TE>   The group is asking Congress to create a national tourism
marketing corporation to promote international travel to the U.S. --
a $103-billion market annually. Officials said the U.S. is the only
major industrialized nation whose government doesn't directly spend
money on marketing tourism abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "As tourism goes, so goes the economic well-being of our
communities," Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who chairs the U.S.
Conference of Mayors' travel and tourism unit, said in a statement.
"We cannot leave it to chance."</TE>

<HD>Wineries, Wholesalers Spar Over Direct-to-Buyer Sales</HD>
<DH>Bush is expected to sign bill allowing shipments to
tourists</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California winemaker Douglass Scott resents that some of the
out-of-state tourists who stream through Koehler Winery's tasting
room in Santa Barbara County can mail home a Yosemite T-shirt or just
about any other memento of their trip to California, but can't ship a
bottle of his wine.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just ridiculous," said Scott, because most of the wine
Koehler produces is sold to winery visitors.</LD>
<LD>   Direct shipments of wine are outlawed in 26 states, but new
legislation expected to be signed by President Bush in the coming
days would chip away at these restrictions by allowing visitors to
wineries who would have carried wine purchases home to have them
shipped instead, even if their home state doesn't allow direct
shipping of alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   (Consumers still won't be able to ship to states such as New York,
which forbid residents from even carrying wine home with them from
out-of-state trips.)</TE>
<TE>   The wine industry concedes that the legislation, which was
inserted at the eleventh hour into a Justice Department
appropriations bill by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep.
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), is largely a symbolic victory. There
is no way to estimate how much additional business will result, and
it doesn't address direct-to-consumer sales of wine over the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   But the new rules put Congress on record as supporting direct
shipping, at least in small amounts, which is at the heart of the
industry's battle to strike down state control of alcohol sales.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, the new legislation is troubling to the
nation's liquor wholesalers, which benefit greatly from states'
three-tier system of distributing wine to consumers, which typically
requires producers to work with state wholesalers, which then sell to
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was inserted into the bill without any debate on the matter.
[The wine industry] is trying to use any means it can to override
states' rights," said Craig Wolf, general counsel for the Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers of America.</TE>
<TE>   States control direct-to-consumer alcohol sales for several
reasons: to protect local alcohol interests, discourage sales to
minors and encourage residents to buy locally to boost state tax
receipts.</TE>
<TE>   But the complicated state-by-state system is under fire on several
fronts. Seven lawsuits are pending, and this month the Federal Trade
Commission opened hearings to determine whether state regulations
that require consumers to buy various goods and services, including
wine, from licensed retailers or wholesalers are necessary or
restrict Internet sales.</TE>
<TE>   Small winemakers, analysts say, rely on direct sales of wine
because they don't produce enough by volume or have enough brands to
make it lucrative for major wholesalers to distribute their goods,
especially now that the distribution side of the liquor business has
been consolidated, leaving only a few large companies.</TE>
<TE>   Winemakers also contend that direct-to-consumer restrictions
impede Internet-based wine merchants that are trying to tap
middle-class consumers' desire for specialty products.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about access to unique wines," said Karen Roche, chief
operating officer of Napa Valley-based Winetasting.com, which sells
wine online to the two dozen states that accept shipments. "We're
spoiled in California. But you don't have to go too far outside a
major city to see selection of wine get limited."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, intense lobbying by wine aficionados and retailers in
recent months prompted auction giant EBay Inc. to set up an online
auction area for wine. The section works within state regulations,
shipping directly to customers where it is legal and requiring
sellers to use special logistics companies that work with in-state
wholesalers where it is not.</TE>
<TE>   States' regulation of alcohol sales ultimately could be settled by
the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge in Indiana has upheld state
laws restricting direct shipments, but district courts in Texas,
North Carolina and Virginia recently struck down state laws that
restrict direct shipping of wine; those cases are on appeal. Four
other cases are pending in New York, Michigan, Florida and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, wine merchants say many wineries already are taking to
the Internet, trying to cut out the middleman and reach customers who
want their wines.</TE>
<TE>   "It cuts me out completely and I resent that," said Ron
Loutherback, co-owner of Wine Club, which last year sold $47 million
worth of wine across the country through its retail stores, catalog
and Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "But do I think wineries should be able to do it? You bet. When
you create monopolies, you do the industry a disservice."</TE>
<TE>   To Koehler, which makes only 7,000 cases of wine each year, the
new law will be more than symbolic.</TE>
<TE>   "I work in the tasting room on Tuesdays and Thursdays and see a
lot of out-of-state people that like us and would like to have some
shipped back or join our wine club, but they can't," Scott said.</TE>

<HD>Wordy Ballots Might Hurt Secession Drives</HD>
<DH>Experts say long-winded measures for Valley and Hollywood
proposals could turn off voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles voters are receiving lots of letters from the
anti-secession campaign, but one mailing that many say puts the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood breakup proposals in a bad light comes
with an official government seal.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the sample ballot that contains the lengthy and
complicated measures for a municipal split. The ballot language
itself is such a turnoff that it could cost the secessionists some
votes, according to political experts in and out of the campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County, which is conducting the Nov. 5 secession
election, generally limits ballot measures to 75 words, but the
Valley and Hollywood secession measures are a mind-numbing 212 and
202, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   And 199 of those words are in a single, run-on sentence that might
have made even Henry James wince.</TE>
<TE>   The county's verbiage limit is not hard-and-fast, and the
officials who drafted the secession measures said they had to run
long to meet legal requirements for full disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   One of those disclosures jumps out of the thicket of text: the
multimillion-dollar separation payments that an independent Valley
and Hollywood would have to pay Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Valley political strategist Arnold Steinberg, a former advisor to
the secessionists, predicted many people will simply vote against
secession rather than wade through and try to comprehend the dense
legalese and scary financial figures.</TE>
<TE>   "This sealed its doom, because of the length of the measure and
its emphasis on money," said Steinberg, who was involved in
successful cityhood campaigns for Malibu and Mission Viejo. "I would
have fought this ballot language, taken it to court, and if I lost
there I would have walked away from [the secession effort]."</TE>
<TE>   George Gorton, a veteran of initiative campaigns, also said he
would have gone to court to simplify the secession measure if he had
been involved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stupid. It's in violation of all political and grammatical
rules," said Gorton, who is managing the campaign for Proposition 49,
the state measure for after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn counts the ballot language as a plus for his
anti-secession drive. "I think generally, if people think something
is convoluted and complicated, they are skeptical about it," Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Valley secession leader Richard Close said voters are smarter
than that. He said he would have preferred a shorter, simpler
measure, but didn't fight for one because he understood the legal
reasons for its length. He also said the wording will not decrease
the number of votes for secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe most people will have full knowledge of this question
and have a decision made before they go into the ballot box," Close
said.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Joel Kotkin, who plans to vote for secession,
is only slightly less optimistic. He predicted that 80% of voters
will have made up their minds before they enter the ballot booth, but
some of the rest could be spooked by the complicated language.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll released this week used the ballot wording for the
first time in querying voters on secession. The poll found that
likely voters citywide were 2 to 1 against Valley secession and
opposed Hollywood independence by an even larger margin.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Randle, a political strategist working on Proposition 49,
said he has seen first-hand how long, complicated measures can chase
off voters.</TE>
<TE>   That, he said, happened to Proposition 8, a school measure that
Randle worked on in 1998. He said it lost in part because it was "too
long" and included language open to interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "If that had been simpler, it probably would have passed, but we
were dealing with complicated policy issues," Randle said.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists found themselves in the same fix. Steinberg said
the ideal measure should have simply asked voters: Shall the San
Fernando Valley (or Hollywood) form its own city, separate and apart
from Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   But the language was drafted by the Local Agency Formation
Commission in a highly politicized atmosphere. With lawyers on both
sides making veiled threats of litigation, LAFCO decided short
measures wouldn't do.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be too simplistic an approach," LAFCO Executive
Officer Larry Calemine said. "People are entitled to know what
[forming a separate city] means."</TE>
<TE>   Originally around 100 words, the measures swelled after city
officials insisted they include the separation payments. The
so-called "alimony" payments account mostly for the difference
between the tax revenues generated by the secession areas and the
value of city services they receive in return.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO and the county Board of Supervisors agreed to the city's
demands, and then granted a counter-demand from secessionists. They
wanted the measures to include an explanation of the payments. And so
they became even more complex.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg said many of the details about the payments could have
been put in the impartial summary of the measures that is sent to
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like it's costing money," he said. "As a general rule,
the harder it is to understand, the more likely people will throw up
their hands and vote against it."</TE>

<HD>Who Will Answer the Education Question?</HD>

<LD>A glum reality of California public schools is that children who are
Latino or black generally learn less than Asians and whites.</LD>
<LD>   There has been some narrowing of this learning gap, based on
scores reported last week from the latest statewide testing. But the
narrowing has been slight, says state Supt. of Public Instruction
Delaine Eastin.</LD>
<LD>   Children of all races and ethnicities have shown improvement since
the state launched its testing in 1999. But Latinos and blacks still
are scoring much lower than Asians and whites.</LD>
<TE>   For example: In last year's exams, 70% of white third-graders
ranked at or above the national average in reading. So did 60% of
Asian kids. But only 27% of Latinos did.</TE>
<TE>   The blame cannot be laid entirely on English language difficulties
because African Americans fared little better. Only 37% met the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the main factors are background and income. More Latinos
and blacks tend to be poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor whites do almost as badly as poor anybody," says Assembly
Education Committee Chairwoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), a
former teacher and L.A. school board president.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor kids are less likely to be read to at home. Their parents
are less educated, but even if they're not, they don't have time
because they're working at more than one job.</TE>
<TE>   "Middle-class blacks do as well as middle-class whites."</TE>
<TE>   Schools do not control socio-economics. But they do control
classrooms. When Latinos, in particular, lag in class, it does not
bode well for California's future. By 2020, Latinos will comprise 39%
of the state's population.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is a recent bright spot, especially the elementary schools.
Under Supt. Roy Romer, L.A. Unified has focused on reading, writing
and math, assigned coaches to subpar teachers and given students
periodic diagnostic exams.</TE>
<TE>   It shows: 72% of L.A. schools met their testing targets, compared
with 53% of California schools overall.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing the next generation to succeed in a fast-paced, highly
competitive world is one of California's most urgent needs. But you
haven't heard much about the racial/ethnic learning gap from the
candidates for governor.</TE>
<TE>   At their only debate, I asked Republican Bill Simon Jr. and Gov.
Gray Davis what they'd do specifically to narrow the gap. Simon gave
the generic response he does to practically every education question.</TE>
<TE>   He said the state's new accountability system -- with its possible
punishments -- should be mandatory for every school district rather
than optional. And he'd impose "a rule that all children shall read
by the third grade." Both worthy ideas.</TE>
<TE>   But, in a seeming contradiction, Simon also said he'd "reduce the
rules and regulations coming out of Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, given less time to answer, touched on some past actions
rather than offer what many wanted to hear: a second-term agenda.
"We've made a lot of efforts to help English-language learners.... We
also have a lot of remedial and after-school and before-school
programs."</TE>
<TE>   Later, I queried the candidates for superintendent of public
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo) mentioned something Davis
could have, but probably forgot: Sacramento, despite a budget crisis,
this year appropriated $217 million to help low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell noted that many low-performing urban schools, because
they're considered undesirable workplaces, are run by rookie
administrators and inexperienced teachers with "emergency"
credentials. About 12% of California's teachers are emergency hires.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Katherine Smith, president of the Anaheim high school
district board, talked vaguely of "going back to teaching basics."</TE>
<TE>   I kept calling around.</TE>
<TE>   Eastin, the termed-out superintendent, said "the No. 1" solution
is universal preschool. Also, pay big bonuses to good teachers
willing to work in bad schools.</TE>
<TE>   All that would cost billions.</TE>
<TE>   Says Senate Education Committee Chairman John Vasconcellos
(D-Santa Clara): "We're talking money. Lots of it. And a lot more of
it if we don't do it." For welfare, health care, prisons.</TE>
<TE>   A new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows that
63% of likely voters feel more money should be spent on their local
schools. Also, 63% support Proposition 47, a $13-billion state school
bond issue. And 64% back Prop. 49, Arnold Schwarzenegger's plan for
after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Education tops the list of issues voters want to hear Davis and
Simon talk about. That's especially true of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos are being targeted for votes. But they're not being talked
to about their chief concern, the glum reality.</TE>

<TE>   Lead poisoning, usually caused when condors eat lead shot used by
hunters, has killed many of the birds since the captive-breeding
program began about 20 years ago. Some critics say all 76 wild
condors should be trapped and brought back into captivity until
alternatives to lead bullets are developed.</TE>
<TE>   So far, two of the three wild-born condor chicks living in Los
Padres National Forest have died.</TE>
<TE>   The first chick was found on a ledge below its cave. The second
chick was found inside its cave. Both were well-fed without obvious
signs of being attacked.</TE>

<HD>' ... and You're Running for What?'</HD>
<DH>Candidates for O.C. public administrator spend as much time
educating voters about the duties of the job as they do campaigning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's public administrator plays a crucial role in
protecting the estates of people who die without wills or immediate
family.</LD>
<LD>   Yet not many residents have ever heard of the job.</LD>
<LD>   This lack of awareness has presented problems for the two
candidates who seek the position, Vicki Landrus and John S. Williams.
Both have turned campaign talks into something more like pubic
service announcements to educate voters.</LD>
<TE>   "We usually have only three to five minutes to speak to groups,
and I find that I use most of that time just explaining what the job
of public administrator is," said Williams, 51, a trustee for the
South Orange County Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County has a growing and aging population, and it's really
important for people to understand what the office does," said
Landrus, 50, now the assistant public administrator.</TE>
<TE>   The public administrator protects the property of those who die in
Orange County when no relative or anyone else is available or legally
appropriate. In some cases, a judge also may call on the public
administrator to act as executor of an estate, said William A. Baker,
the current public administrator, who is not seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Baker's office receives about 100 new cases a month. It
administers the most difficult; the rest are assigned to private
attorneys or the county counsel's office.</TE>
<TE>   Landrus, who has raised $57,000 in campaign contributions, has won
the endorsement of Baker, who cites her abilities and management
skills.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a retired sergeant in the Orange County marshal's
office, has the endorsement of Sheriff Michael S. Carona and about 30
police and firefighters associations in the county. He has raised
$83,000.</TE>
<TE>   Landrus has worked for the county 21 years, for the chief
executive office and as business manager for the public defender. She
was hired as assistant public administrator three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Landrus said she would improve the use of technology, such as
online searches for relatives and potential heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said a 2001 grand jury report criticized the public
administrator for failing to seek legislation requiring background
checks for conservator appointees. He said the public administrator
only recently sought the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Williams said he wants an elder-abuse task force and
plans to train police about financial abuse of the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   In the March primary, Landrus received 144,763 votes, or 41%;
Williams received 126,630, or 36%.</TE>

<HD>3 Die in Plane Crash Near Agua Dulce Airfield</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A twin-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff Sunday from Agua
Dulce Air Park, killing three people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the crash in a remote area east of Palmdale is
unknown. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.</LD>
<LD>   The identities of the passengers were not released.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said the six-seat, Aerostar aircraft never seemed to
gain enough power as it left the runway shortly before 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The plane crashed within 15 seconds of liftoff, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't get off the ground until the very end," said David
Aiello, a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "It veered left through the canyon, disappeared around a little
hill ... then boom -- black cloud."</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Evan Jenkins, said he was preparing food for a
barbecue at the airfield when he saw the pilot struggling with the
takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   "He barely cleared two houses," Jenkins said. "He fell like a
pancake to the ground because he wasn't going fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   Several people ran to the scene, but they were unable to rescue
the pilot and passengers, trapped in the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins and Aiello said the pilot and passengers were not regulars
at the small airport in Agua Dulce. They believed the plane
originally took off from Whiteman Airport in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Whiteman Airport officials could not confirm the information.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Los Angeles City Fireboat No. 2, the Ralph J. Scott,
celebrates the 77th anniversary of its launching Sunday with a
half-hour water display at the Port of Los Angeles. The fireboat's
water cannons can shoot a total of 16,814 gallons per minute. The
99-foot vessel, the largest of five in the Los Angeles Fire
Department and the nation's oldest active first-line fireboat, is
expected to be replaced next spring. It is named after the
department's longest-serving chief, who held the post from 1919 to
1940.</CP>

<PH>THE WORLD SERIES</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Forging Lifelong Angels Fans</HD>
<DH>The Cinderella team's ascent to its first World Series is
just the kind of memory that will create a generation of die-hard
loyalists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle and Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series is well underway, but Anaheim Angels fan Alex Horst
thinks he's already soared to his season's high, maybe even a
lifetime high, though that's hard to say when you're only 14.</LD>
<LD>   The peak came two Sundays ago as the Angels clinched their first
World Series berth with a stunning come-from-behind 10-run rally over
the Minnesota Twins. Alex was energy unleashed, running through the
stands like a madman, foul pole to foul pole, his head helmeted by a
self-styled "rally bucket" made from an old popcorn pail.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so jampacked," said Alex, of Garden Grove, his voice still
racing with excitement days later. "I didn't sit in my seat the
entire game. Everybody would cheer me on. They'd hit my rally bucket
with their thunder sticks. When they exploded in the seventh inning,
I was just going nuts."</LD>
<TE>   Baseball fans are made, not born, and for many Southern California
youngsters these heady days will forge them as die-hard followers of
the sport -- and, in particular, of the Angels, a team that has
struggled to match the Dodgers in local fan loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   And this is the time of year when true fans -- those who cheered
on the Angels before Hollywood stars began filling up the bandwagon
-- like to wax nostalgic and when history connects with the present
to blaze a path to the future.</TE>
<TE>   That seeming timelessness is part of the mystique of baseball, a
game shrouded in superstitions, legends and a sense of history in
which each crack of the bat carries the echo of dead heroes. It can
be a personal obsession that sociologists say often begins with
something as simple as a father and a son in the stands, a bag of
peanuts and a ballgame on the field.</TE>
<TE>   The making of a fan usually begins at home. If parents watch games
on TV and take the kids to the ballpark, they pass their interest on.
Special moments -- an autograph or conversation with a player -- seal
the relationship. Though many women follow sports, adult fans
overwhelmingly are men who point to bonding experiences with their
fathers as key to developing their love for the game, and a given
team.</TE>
<TE>   The First Time</TE>
<TE>   "We ask people to think back to their early memories of how they
got involved in a sport and a lot of people talk about that first
trip to the ballpark or stadium," said Jeffrey James, an assistant
professor in the department of leisure studies at the University of
Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. "And there's something about a parent,
specifically with fathers, and this transference of what we might
think of as a love for the game. It's the value of the sport that we
communicate."</TE>
<TE>   Toss in a World Series for the local team and the average
8-year-old is hooked for life.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Angell, 81, a fiction editor at the New Yorker, has made a
side career of writing about baseball. He believes fans are created
by atmosphere, and proximity, and that the initial infatuation
distilled in youth matures like a good scotch.</TE>
<TE>   "That early childhood team stays with you," said Angell.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Manhattan, Angell grew up following the New York Giants
and the Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, with the Brooklyn
Dodgers an irrelevant third. The reason: The Giants' Polo Grounds and
Yankee Stadium were closer, in the Bronx, than was Ebbets Field way
out in Brooklyn. And though the Yankees were powerful -- kids
gravitate to winners -- Angell recalls being distrustful of the Bronx
Bombers' success.</TE>
<TE>   "Even back then I realized that the Yankees won the title a little
too often to make it fun," Angell said, adding that a Yankees-less
World Series this year promises a return of baseball drama. "I'm
delighted. This pairing is going to be different."</TE>
<TE>   Angell links his love for the game with those long-ago stadium
trips with his father, whose long-suffering loyalty was to the
Cleveland Indians of the Cy Young days in the early 1900s. The
Indians went on to a century of mostly ignominious seasons, winning
only two World Series in five appearances since 1901.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in some ways the suffering is what it's all about,"
Angell said. "You have to have stayed with a team long enough to have
your heart broken and then start all over the next year, and every
now and then win."</TE>
<TE>   Angels fans know about broken hearts. Since Gene Autry founded the
team for the 1961 season, the Angels had thrice gone to the playoffs
and collapsed each time. Yet those failures have little effect on
whether fans stay faithful or wander off to new loves. Ballparks
might be empty during losing seasons, but fans still follow their
teams, their interest ratcheting up or down depending on performance.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, baseball attendance has been in a slide under the
onslaught of competition from other professional sports, new computer
entertainment habits and increased demands on leisure time. Yet teams
still attracted 68 million people to ballparks this year.</TE>
<TE>   Always an Afterthought</TE>
<TE>   The Angels enjoyed a surge of interest this season, but the team
has always been something of a fan afterthought to the Dodgers, much
as the basketball Clippers are drowned out by the Los Angeles Lakers
and as Anaheim's Mighty Ducks bow to the Los Angeles Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Even in this most successful of Angels seasons, the Dodgers
outdrew the Angels 3.1 million fans to 2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   That status as the lesser-loved sibling vexes longtime Angels
fans, who can trace their team's Southern California roots almost as
far back as the Dodgers. The Angels began as a new franchise playing
in the old Wrigley Field in South-Central Los Angeles in 1961, three
seasons after the O'Malley family decamped from Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers had a lineage, and the Angels were just created as a
new franchise," said California historian Kevin Starr. "They didn't
have the great stories and traditions."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Dodgers were the first to arrive at a time when Los
Angeles was seeking the kind of validation that a major league team
can bring. It didn't hurt that Los Angeles stole the team from its
sibling rival, New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers cemented their fan base with a World Series win in
1959, their second year here. The Angels did well for an expansion
team in their first few seasons but then did the unforgivable: moved
to suburbia, a lifestyle no true Angeleno wants to identify with even
though it is Southern California's defining characteristic.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Brewsaugh, 20, was born in suburbia -- Mission Viejo -- and
fittingly proclaims his Angels loyalty. A math and engineering major
at Chapman University, Brewsaugh takes in 35 or so Angels games a
year. His dorm room looks like a psychedelic cave with more than a
dozen bright-red thunder sticks hanging like stalactites.</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised on the Angels," said Brewsaugh, who has World Series
tickets. "I don't remember the first time I went to the stadium
because we would go so frequently. We would just make it a family
outing. I remember once going in Little League when my dad was
president, and I got to be one of the kids to go out to the pitcher's
mound and wave my cap."</TE>
<TE>   David Owens, 30, an Air Force pilot from Lake Forest living in
Charleston, S.C., remembers the stadium as a childhood playground
where he and his father would sneak into the outfield seats and shag
home-run balls during batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   He still has autographs from Angels favorites Bobby Grich and
Brian Downing, and a red-white-and-blue Reggie Jackson pen that the
Hall of Famer used to hand out in lieu of signatures.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good times," said Owens, home on leave to watch his
Angels' run for the World Series. "I probably never even watched the
whole game. I was a little kid. All you want to do is run around and
buy cotton candy."</TE>
<TE>   Like Brewsaugh, Owens remembers venturing out onto the field
during special Little League promotions, the icing on the cake for a
ready-made fan.</TE>
<TE>   "You get to walk by a baseball player," Owens said, his voice
speeding up with the flood of memories. "When you're that little,
they look like giants, and you hope that some day that could be you.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the kind of stuff that molds you."</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Stump for Votes Off the Beaten Path</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones and Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Sunday began a two-day campaign swing across
California, reaching out to Latino immigrants and other first-time
voters as his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., exhorted fellow
Republicans to turn out on Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by Latino politicians and labor leaders, Davis touted
his record and solicited support at an afternoon rally in the
southern Coachella Valley community of Thermal. He made the same
pitch later before a Democratic crowd in Oxnard before heading to
Anaheim to attend Game 2 of the World Series as a guest of Disney
Chairman Michael Eisner.</LD>
<LD>   "We made progress the last four years, but for the 16 years before
I came into office the men and women of labor didn't have a friend in
the governor's office," Davis told a cheering crowd of about 500 in
the Coachella Valley High School gymnasium. "You have one now."</LD>
<TE>   Davis strode into the gymnasium as the high school mariachi band
blasted out a spirited rendition of "La Negra," a tune that used to
announce the arrival of the late United Farm Workers union leader
Cesar Chavez. Davis walked past earnest members of the high school
cadet corps dressed in camouflage fatigue pants and black shirts, as
many in the crowd waved the black-and-red Aztec eagle flags of the
UFW.</TE>
<TE>   To the north in San Luis Obispo, Simon dropped in at a Republican
golf tournament and crab feed on a fog-enshrouded beach, and told
reporters that he has tried to appeal to farm workers and their
allies with his proposals for more affordable housing and improved
schools. "We're very, very sensitive to the needs of workers," he
said. "All the solutions that we've talked about -- some have been
specific to farm workers, but most have been specific to really all
of our people."</TE>
<TE>   With the election little more than two weeks away, the major-party
candidates spent Sunday in regions less traveled during the bulk of
the state's gubernatorial campaigns, which usually feature big-city
electioneering in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with side trips to
Sacramento and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunday, Davis was in Thermal and Oxnard. And Simon, after a
quick news conference in San Jose, was in San Luis Obispo before
heading to Bakersfield, where today he will begin a Central Valley
bus tour.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides said the governor was lured to dust-blown Thermal in
part because Coachella Valley High School is home to Chauncey Veatch,
a local celebrity after being named national teacher of the year. A
banner honoring Veatch hung on one wall.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Davis' campaign events in the last week have been targeted
at inspiring disaffected or disinterested Democrats to vote on Nov. 5
-- rather than appealing to swing or moderate Republican voters who
aren't thrilled with Simon. The Davis efforts are a response to polls
that show an especially turned-off electorate heading into the
November election, analysts said. The California Labor Federation,
UFW and other unions and labor groups in California are leading the
mobilization effort on behalf of Davis. UFW members and other farm
workers have been fired up in part by Davis' Sept. 30 signing of
legislation granting unionized farm workers the right of mandatory
mediation -- a form of binding arbitration -- in stalled negotiations
with growers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is particularly interested in the growing pool of first-time
and infrequent voters. In Thermal, a small town set amid date palm
groves and citrus orchards, farm worker Hilario Torres, 52, is
counting the days until he votes in his first election since becoming
a U.S. citizen last year. His choice for governor? "Gray Davis, of
course," said Torres, who with the crowd in the local high school gym
cheered the first visit by a California governor in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the governor who has done a lot for the farm workers,"
Torres said. "He's always been a friend of the farm workers."</TE>
<TE>   The Coachella Valley crowd cheered when Davis ticked off his
accomplishments in the last four years -- paid family leave for most
California workers, several major pieces of legislation benefiting
farm workers, 300,000 new scholarships for college-bound students,
and a return to the eight-hour workday revoked by his Republican
predecessor, Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Davis warned that his GOP opponent would roll back most of those
measures if elected. "We need to send a message to Mr. Simon," said
Davis, aiming a standard line at Simon, who moved west to California
about a decade ago. "He is not going to roll back anything. We're
going to roll him back to New Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's target, in contrast, was the dedicated voter. Speaking
briefly to about 75 members of the local Republican central committee
seated under a large yellow tent at the edge of an oceanfront golf
course in San Luis Obispo, the GOP candidate declared himself upbeat
about the state of the campaign. Coatless and with his sleeves rolled
up, Simon grabbed the microphone and beamed a sunny smile at the
assembled supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to bring you a message of optimism and hope because
we are going to win on November the 5th," he said, prompting cheers
from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to win, I can feel it as I go throughout the state.
The energy's there, just like it was in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   "And I can feel the desperation in Mr. Davis," he said. "He's a
desperate man; he'll do desperate things."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said his ideas about jobs, schools and an affordable quality
of life are resonating with voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be focused on making your life better, every single
day of your life, and every single day that I'm in office -- I
promise you that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's underdog status has not squelched excitement about his
candidacy, several people there said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for true dedicated Republicans, they're very anxious,"
said Atascadero resident Edie Knight, a member of the central
committee. "We're all in it for the last few weeks."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Drivers Willing to Pay to Pick Up Speed in
Carpool Lanes</HD>
<DH>Project along eight-mile stretch of Interstate 15 attracts
20,000 regular customers and soon will be expanded to 20 miles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a small section of freeway in San Diego County, motorists with a
few extra dollars to spare can buy their way past gridlock and into a
set of fast-moving freeway lanes.</LD>
<LD>   It is a privilege that rankles some who refer to the lanes as
"Lexus lanes" and complain that they are just another example -- like
valet parking and gated communities -- of rich folks buying their way
around the hassles of living in crowded urban communities.</LD>
<LD>   Critics worry that, if expanded, the San Diego County freeway
program would create a two-tiered highway class structure: well-to-do
drivers speeding to work on free-flowing lanes while everyone else
idles in maddening congestion.</LD>
<TE>   "It discriminates against people who are of low economic means,"
said Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, a longtime member of
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway program is part of an experiment that many
transportation experts see as a possible solution to Southern
California's worsening traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   On Interstate 15, just outside San Diego, an eight-mile stretch of
carpool lanes has been converted to High Occupancy Toll lanes. The
lanes are open to solo drivers willing to pay tolls of 50 cents to $4
to cruise past the daily bumper-to-bumper congestion. Carpools still
use the lanes free of charge.</TE>
<TE>   The lanes have been so popular -- attracting at least 20,000
regular toll-paying motorists -- that the three-year pilot project
soon will be permanently expanded to a 20-mile stretch. The tolls are
generating more than $1 million a year to fund a new bus line.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County officials are considering similar programs on two
other freeways near downtown San Diego. "It's been an incredibly
popular program," said Kim Kawada, a regional planner for the San
Diego Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   High Occupancy Toll lanes are an example of a traffic management
tool known as "value pricing," which relies on the power of the free
market to manage traffic flow. Under value pricing, freeway tolls
increase during peak commute times to discourage motorists from
driving during those congested periods.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, home of the worst traffic congestion in the
nation, the idea of value pricing has failed to gain much traction.
"There is a concern that people are already paying for the freeways
through their gas taxes, and why should they have to pay again?" said
Lancaster Mayor Frank Roberts, who sits on the MTA board.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, academics and transportation experts throughout the
country say the idea is gaining momentum, thanks to the success of
the San Diego County freeway project.</TE>
<TE>   "The research community sees this as a great opportunity to fix
some serious traffic problems," said Brian Taylor, director of UCLA's
Institute of Transportation Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Time, Stress Are Factors</TE>
<TE>   Motorists who use the High Occupancy Toll lanes on Interstate 15
say the lanes make their drives more predictable and less stressful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just freed me up to leave whenever I want," said Thomas
Baden, a senior executive at a guitar manufacturer who commutes from
El Cajon to Escondido every day. He said the $40 a month he pays for
tolls is well spent because he has eliminated much of his commuting
stress and gets more time with his family. "People need to put a
perspective on what their time is worth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Aker, a construction company executive whose work sends him
throughout the San Diego region, said he uses the lanes to ensure
that he gets to his meetings on time. "I do it more for an added
certainty factor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard "Bud" Gminski, general manager of a media company who has
used the lanes since the program started in 1996, rejects the
suggestion that it discriminates against the poor. He noted that
drivers can keep toll costs low by using the lanes only when
absolutely necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm far from rich," he said. "But if you have to pick up your kid
at school at a certain time, $3 or $4 is not too much to spend. It's
an expense that anyone who is working can afford."</TE>
<TE>   Gminski estimates that the lanes halve his regular 40-minute
commute from his home in the Poway area to downtown San Diego. He
suggests that the program be expanded to let toll payers zip past the
ramp meters that regulate traffic flow entering the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities with notoriously bad traffic, including Houston and
New York, already operate similar programs. Denver, San Francisco and
Seattle are studying the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of interest, particularly with the success of the
San Diego project," said Lee Munnich, a senior fellow with the Hubert
Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County's High Occupancy Toll lanes were the brainchild
of Jan Goldsmith, a former assemblyman and mayor of Poway.</TE>
<TE>   More than six years ago, Goldsmith noticed that the carpool lanes
on Interstate 15 near Mira Mesa were carrying only about 10% of their
capacity. Goldsmith, now a Superior Court judge, also worried that
the county lacked the money for much-needed transit services. To
solve both problems, he suggested selling the excess capacity in the
carpool lanes to solo drivers and using the extra revenue to pay for
new bus services.</TE>
<TE>   The idea had the support of some lawmakers and transportation
planners, but was harshly criticized by some of his constituents.
"There was a lot of resistance to the idea of letting people buy
their way out of traffic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldsmith pressed ahead with the project anyway and eventually
received $10 million in federal and state funding to test the idea
for three years, starting in 1996. Since then, overall use of the
carpool lanes has nearly doubled, with about a quarter of that
traffic attributed to toll-paying solo drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The tolls, collected electronically with the use of transponders
mounted on vehicle windshields, vary from 50 cents in off-peak hours
to $4 during prime commuting periods. They generate $1.2 million
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Poll Finds 70% Support</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll of San Diego motorists found nearly 70% support for
the High Occupancy Toll lanes.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the San Diego Assn. of Governments voted to expand the
project to a 20-mile length of Interstate 15. The regional planning
agency also has recommended testing High Occupancy Toll lanes on
Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The project is routinely cited by academics and others throughout
the country as a successful example of value-pricing strategies. But
its success has been largely overshadowed in Southern California by
the problems of other toll road experiments.</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes -- a privately owned tollway between Anaheim
and Riverside County -- charges a toll that increases during peak
commute times. But that tollway has been mired in political
controversy, largely because the state gave the toll road operators
the right to forestall competition by blocking improvements on the
Riverside Freeway. Orange County transportation officials are
planning to buy the privately owned lanes and eliminate the tolls.
Three other toll roads in Orange County are struggling with
lower-than-expected revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the idea of introducing tolls or fees to
manage traffic flow seems to have more critics than supporters. Hasan
Ikhrata, manager of transportation planning for the Southern
California Assn. of Governments, said he contributed to a 1994 study
that recommended testing value-pricing strategies on some freeways in
Southern California. "Politically, it didn't get anywhere," he said.
"We were told in a very clear way by our board: Don't ever talk about
fees."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, regional transportation officials are studying the
possibility of High Occupancy Toll lanes on the Antelope Valley
Freeway at the northern edge of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he would like to study
the success of San Diego County's High Occupancy Toll lanes, but
vowed to oppose charging motorists fees to drive in existing freeway
lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe in taking away something that the public now
gets for free," he said. "It's bad public policy. It's terrible
politics."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Yaroslavsky said he prefers to rely on incentives, such
as offering free parking for carpool users, to reduce freeway
congestion. Los Angeles County officials also point out that Los
Angeles and San Diego counties differ in some key roadway and traffic
characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky seems to have the pulse of his constituents. A recent
survey by the MTA found that almost two-thirds of the county
residents who were polled opposed the idea of charging tolls to let
solo drivers use carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Little Excess Capacity</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials also note that most carpool lanes in Los
Angeles County already are heavily used and have little excess
capacity to sell to solo drivers. A recent state study found that, on
average, carpool lanes in Los Angeles County were operating at about
67% of capacity, with several freeway segments nearly full during
peak commute periods.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's carpool lane system -- the largest in the
nation -- also has enjoyed increasing popularity among motorists.
From 2000 to 2001, the number of carpoolers using the lanes increased
by 11%, from 281,000 to 312,000 vehicles per day.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Maekawa, an MTA planning engineer, said High Occupancy Toll
lanes might be feasible on some of the less-congested freeways in the
outlying reaches of the county, such as the Pomona Freeway,
connecting Riverside and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   But even Goldsmith concedes that his traffic solution for
Interstate 15 might not work everywhere. "What is right for the I-15
corridor in San Diego County may not work for L.A.," he said.</TE>

Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, ordering the detachment of
the San Fernando Valley area from the City of Los Angeles and the
incorporation of the entire detached territory as a general law city
be confirmed, subject to such terms and conditions, including
establishment of a provisional appropriations limit for the new city
of $1.354 billion, the requirement that the new city continue to levy
all previously authorized and collected charges, fees, assessments
and general or special taxes collected by the city of Los Angeles
within the San Fernando Valley area, except as prohibited by law, and
that the new city make annual fiscal mitigation payments to the city
of Los Angeles of $127,122,000 adjusted for inflation and reduced by
5 percent per year for a total of 20 years, which payments the Local

<HD>A New and Improved Think Tank</HD>
<DH>Dana Point's Ocean Institute has a grand opening to thank
those who worked on its $16.5-million expansion project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ocean Institute in Dana Point capped a weekend of grand-opening
events with a Sunday "family fun day" that included educational
displays, surf bands and a brunch smorgasbord.</LD>
<LD>   The event, which was attended by about 1,300 people, was a
thank-you to members, donors and volunteers who worked on the
waterfront facility's $16.5-million renovation and expansion that is
expected to attract more than 135,000 students annually.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the 34,000-square-foot nonprofit institute -- five
times larger than the old facility -- worked for two years with
teachers to create programs that augment curriculum guidelines of
California public schools.</LD>
<TE>   "We want [students] to feel like they are young scientists," said
Deidre Cavazzi, who writes lesson plans for the institute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely not a place where they will listen to a
lecture. They are in charge here. We are just facilitators."</TE>
<TE>   From Monday through Friday, the institute will cater to school
groups. On the weekends, it will soon offer public tours.</TE>
<TE>   The Ecology Learning Center, with its discovery pool of starfish,
crabs, sea snails and other tidal animals, is one example of how the
refurbished facility will educate the minds of children in
kindergarten through third grade.</TE>
<TE>   Young visitors can surround themselves with silver opal-eye perch
by putting their heads into the opening of a bell-shaped fish tank.
They also can see scientific tools such as cameras and microscopes,
and films showing how difficult it is for a starfish to cling to a
rock.</TE>
<TE>   Children's literature, including "House for Hermit Crab" by Eric
Carle and the poetry book "In the Swim" by Douglas Florian, also is
read in the room to establish the relationship between fact and
fiction, Cavazzi said.</TE>
<TE>   An area dedicated to surfing teaches electricity, weather and
matter to older children.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hillenburg, the creator of sea-inspired cartoon character
SpongeBob SquarePants, and Tom Kenny, who does SpongeBob's voice,
were signing books Sunday at the institute. Hillenburg worked as an
institute instructor from 1986 to 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He said the renovation "is certainly going to help them to be more
effective in helping students appreciate the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   The new institute replaces one that attracted about 78,000
students annually. That facility was torn down last year after years
of debate about what to put in its place.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, visitors said they were pleased that the new facility
is more educational and less entertainment-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to be able to come down here and have some
good learning experiences," said Sue Wood, a Laguna Niguel mother of
5- and 10-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more of these normal-type activities. A theme park would
have brought the area down."</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Wassmann, a 15-year volunteer, brought his daughter to a
tank of moon jellyfish.</TE>
<TE>   As she pressed her nose against the glass, Wassmann said the
expansion "is probably one of the best things to happen to Dana
Point.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nice that someone didn't just build [a theme park]. This
fun here is education."</TE>

<HD>GOP Challenger in Uphill Battle Against Pavley</HD>
<DH>Michael Wissot has Sen. John McCain's backing. But that
might not be enough to wrest the 41st Assembly seat from Agoura
Hills' ex-mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knocking on doors of likely voters in Woodland Hills, Michael Wissot
flashes a game smile, drops off a flier with a beaming photo of
himself and Rudy Giuliani, and makes some all-important political
small talk.</LD>
<LD>   "How about sending a nice Jewish boy to Sacramento?" he asks
77-year-old Sharon Rosen when he sees a mezuzah in her doorway.</LD>
<LD>   "How about sending a nice, honest boy to Sacramento?" she
responds. "That's the first thing."</LD>
<TE>   It's another day on an uphill campaign trail for the 28-year-old
first-time candidate who is challenging Assemblywoman Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura Hills).</TE>
<TE>   The numbers don't favor Wissot, the GOP standard-bearer in a
heavily Democratic area. Spanning a region from Santa Monica up the
coast to Oxnard, the 41st Assembly District is 48% Democratic and 33%
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, Pavley is a veteran of local politics in the
district while Wissot started the campaign with virtually no local
name recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley, 53, was the first mayor of Agoura Hills, taking the post
soon after the small, semi-rural city on the western fringe of Los
Angeles County incorporated in 1982. She served on the City Council
there for the next 15 years, including three additional terms as
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   In her first term as a state legislator, she drew national
attention by pushing through the nation's first restrictions on
vehicular carbon dioxide emissions. The auto industry fought the
measure vigorously and has vowed to sue. But if the law Pavley
championed remains intact, it will change the design of all vehicles
made in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To her opponent the key issue is Pavley herself -- a woman he
paints as a well-intended but fundamentally clueless environmental
zealot.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt her heart is in the right place," he said. "She'd make a
great president of the Sierra Club. But she doesn't have the aptitude
to address just about anything outside the environment."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Pavley has no problem identifying her "passions" as
education -- she was a middle-school teacher in Moorpark for 25 years
-- and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   After she was elected in 2000, she said, a politically savvy
friend offered some valuable advice: "You're in there for such a
limited time," the friend said. "Focus on just a few things that are
really important to you and try to make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Wissot contends, the difference has not been a good one.
"She wants to tax our motor vehicles," Wissot told a man who answered
the door during his Woodland Hills precinct-walk.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to clean our air," the man countered.</TE>
<TE>   Blond and telegenic, Wissot grew up in Westlake Village, graduated
from James Madison University in Virginia, and earned a master's
degree from the University of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   He has not run for office before but was spurred into politics by
a brief stint on the staff of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In his SUV (license plate: PR4GOP), Wissot sometimes listens to
CDs of a memoir by McCain.</TE>
<TE>   "He reminds me of the commitment I always want to have as a public
servant," Wissot said.</TE>
<TE>   McCain endorsed his former staffer, who worked for him as an
intern in 1998 and helped on two campaigns. But that association -- a
key point in Wissot's pitch to voters -- may not be enough to unseat
Pavley, according to a Republican political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an outstanding candidate in a very bad district," said
Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California Target Book political
report. "It's a highly safe Democratic seat."</TE>

<TE>   Passed by a narrow margin earlier this year, the bill aims to stem
global warming by limiting tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases.
Automakers poured $5 million into fighting the measure, which will

Silicon Valley CEOs who saw business opportunities in new technology.</TE>
<TE>   Her coalition is now seen as "a model of how to effectively level
the playing field against special-interest money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The law will increase vehicle costs, cut automotive jobs and
degrade the air by forcing drivers to hold on to older cars for a
longer period, Wissot said. Although it does not give the California
Air Resources Board the authority to levy taxes, it will shrink
industry in the state and force additional taxation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the bill's author, Pavley showed "little or no regard for the
inhabitants of the environment she claims to represent," he said.
Pavley said such claims spring from "the disinformation campaign"
started by the automakers.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates oppose the controversial development at Ahmanson
Ranch, which would create a community of about 8,000 residents in
Ventura County, just over the county line from the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sept. 30, Pavley's campaign had raised $155,165, including
donations from education organizations, public employees' unions and
a few entertainment figures such as musician Don Henley. Wissot's
campaign had raised $67,327 from 350 individuals, with no donations
accepted from political action committees, according to Wissot's
spokesman, Ryan Powers.</TE>
<TE>   Also running is Libertarian Brian "Max" Kelly, a Santa Monica
businessman. Kelly, 33, is a first-time candidate who wants such
government functions as parkland protection privatized.</TE>

<HD>New GOP Face in Tough Battle Against Pavley</HD>
<DH>Michael Wissot has Sen. John McCain's backing. But that
might not be enough to wrest the 41st Assembly seat from Agoura
Hills' ex-mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knocking on doors of likely voters in Woodland Hills, Michael Wissot
flashes a game smile, drops off a flier with a beaming photo of
himself and Rudy Giuliani, and makes some all-important political
small talk.</LD>
<LD>   "How about sending a nice Jewish boy to Sacramento?" he asks
77-year-old Sharon Rosen when he sees a mezuzah in her doorway. "How
about sending a nice, honest boy to Sacramento?" she responds.
"That's the first thing."</LD>
<LD>   It's another day on an uphill campaign trail for the 28-year-old
first-time candidate who is challenging Assemblywoman Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura Hills).</LD>
<TE>   The numbers don't favor Wissot, the GOP standard-bearer in a
heavily Democratic area. Spanning a region from Santa Monica up the
coast to Oxnard, the 41st Assembly District is 48% Democratic and 33%
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, Pavley is a veteran of local politics in the
district while Wissot started the campaign with virtually no local
name recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley, 53, was the first mayor of Agoura Hills, taking the post
soon after the small, semi-rural city on the western fringe of Los
Angeles County incorporated in 1982. She served on the City Council
there for the next 15 years, including three additional terms as
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   In her first term as a state legislator, she drew national
attention by pushing through the nation's first restrictions on
vehicular carbon dioxide emissions. The auto industry fought the
measure vigorously and has vowed to sue. But if the law Pavley
championed remains intact, it will change the design of all vehicles
made in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To her opponent, the key issue is Pavley herself -- a woman he
paints as a well-intended but fundamentally clueless environmental
zealot.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt her heart is in the right place," he said. "She'd make a
great president of the Sierra Club. But she doesn't have the aptitude
to address just about anything outside the environment."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Pavley has no problem identifying her "passions" as
education -- she was a Moorpark middle-school teacher for 25 years --
and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   After she was elected in 2000, she said, a politically savvy
friend offered some valuable advice: "You're in there for such a
limited time," the friend said. "Focus on just a few things that are
really important to you and try to make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Wissot contends, the difference has not been a good one.
"She wants to tax our motor vehicles," Wissot told a man who answered
the door during his Woodland Hills precinct-walk.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to clean our air," the man countered.</TE>
<TE>   Blond and telegenic, Wissot grew up in Westlake Village, graduated
from James Madison University in Virginia, and earned a master's
degree from the University of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   He has not run for office before but was spurred into politics by
a brief stint on the staff of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In his SUV (license plate: PR4GOP), Wissot sometimes listens to
CDs of a memoir by McCain.</TE>
<TE>   "He reminds me of the commitment I always want to have as a public
servant," Wissot said.</TE>
<TE>   McCain endorsed his former staffer, who worked for him as an
intern in 1998 and helped on two campaigns. But that association -- a
key point in Wissot's pitch to voters -- may not be enough to unseat
Pavley, according to a Republican political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an outstanding candidate in a very bad district," said
Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California Target Book political
report. "It's a highly safe Democratic seat."</TE>
<TE>   With much of Oxnard and all of Port Hueneme added as a result of
redistricting, the percentage of registered Latinos in the district
rose from 5% to 10%, boosting the number of likely Democratic votes,
Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wissot is young, articulate, aggressive and has political
experience," Hoffenblum said. "He's looking for the future."</TE>
<TE>   When Pavley first entered a race for state office in 2000, she was
also viewed as a long shot.</TE>
<TE>   In the primary to replace Sheila Kuehl, who moved to the state
Senate, Pavley was outspent more than 2 to 1 by S. David Freeman,
then the head of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   In her subsequent campaign against Republican child advocate Jayne
Murphy Shapiro, she rolled out the same credentials she relies upon
now: career teacher, activist who helped incorporate Agoura Hills to
save it from over-development, and a strong environmental voice on
the California Coastal Commission and the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley was swept to victory.</TE>
<TE>   In her first term, Pavley introduced a number of bills that became
law without much fuss: the creation of a state poet laureate's post,
for example, and a pilot project to turn waste from rice operations
in Northern California into bricks for freeway sound barriers.</TE>
<TE>   By far her most contentious bill was one that brought her both the
wrath of the auto industry and a "Freshman of the Year" award from
the California League of Conservation Voters.</TE>
<TE>   Passed by a narrow margin earlier this year, the bill aims to stem
global warming by limiting tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases.
Automakers poured $5 million into fighting the measure, which will
require technology to reduce carbon dioxide and other gases starting
with 2009-model vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley said she built an "unconventional" coalition to lobby for
the bill, from ski-area operators worried about skimpy snowpack to
Silicon Valley CEOs who saw business opportunities in new technology.
Her coalition is now seen as "a model of how to effectively level the
playing field against special-interest money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The law will increase vehicle costs, cut automotive jobs and
degrade the air by forcing drivers to hold on to older cars for a
longer period, Wissot said. Although it does not give the California
Air Resources Board the authority to levy taxes, it will shrink
industry in the state and force additional taxation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the bill's author, Pavley showed "little or no regard for the
inhabitants of the environment she claims to represent," he said.
Pavley said such claims spring from "the disinformation campaign"
started by the automakers.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates oppose the controversial development at Ahmanson
Ranch, which would create a community of about 8,000 residents in
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sept. 30, Pavley's campaign had raised $155,165, including
donations from education organizations, public employees' unions and
a few entertainment figures such as musician Don Henley. Wissot had
raised $67,327 from 350 individuals, with no donations accepted from
political action committees, according to Wissot's spokesman, Ryan

<HD>War Talk Brings Call for Peace</HD>
<DH>Ventura doctor gathers activists who provide a meeting
place and a friendly ear for those who oppose nuclear arms and
invading Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Dodge stood at the end of his Ventura driveway one morning in
March, looking in disbelief at a newspaper headline:</LD>
<LD>   "U.S. Works Up Plan for Using Nuclear Arms."</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest in a string of headlines that had left the
Ventura physician depressed about the violent direction the world
seemed to be heading since Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   And for him, it was the last straw.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with a neighbor who was outside reading the same
headline, Dodge began recruiting members for a group he would call
Citizens for Peaceful Resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   The first meeting consisted of a handful of people sitting around
a kitchen counter. But since then, the group's messages have struck a
chord with doctors, teachers, scientists and others in Ventura and
throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   In six months, the group's e-mail list has grown to more than 300,
and its meetings, held from 3 to 5 p.m. the first Sunday of every
month, typically draw more than 100 people.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people are afraid of speaking up because they will be
labeled unpatriotic and un-American," Dodge said. "I wanted to give
people permission to talk about these issues."</TE>
<TE>   That role becomes increasingly vital, said Debbie Golden, a
Ventura school board trustee and citizens group member, after
Congress recently granted President Bush broad powers to declare war
on Iraq -- unilaterally, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important to just get together and ask questions right
now," said Golden, who has been active in politics since her teens.
"Why would we want to attack Iraq right now? Isn't there a better way
to take care of Saddam Hussein? Why aren't we working toward
eliminating nuclear arms instead of escalating weapons of mass
destruction?"</TE>
<TE>   Recent public-opinion polls show that a majority of Americans
support an overthrow of Saddam Hussein, even if it means a
first-strike invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Ventura County, so far from where such decisions are
made, it is hard to stay hopeful, Golden said. Belonging to the peace
group helps, if only because it makes her realize that she is not
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe that grass-roots groups can make a difference --
that one person can make a difference. I couldn't live without hope
for a universe that's more peaceful," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, in a meeting room at E.P. Foster Library in downtown
Ventura, Dodge stood before about 60 people as they brainstormed ways
to get their anti-war message out: Call the White House. Call your
congressman. Ask your kids' teachers to make extra-credit assignments
related to war debates and rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Sign up at Toastmasters, a woman suggested: "They'll let you talk
about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge, who talks more rapidly as he warms to a subject, told about
an unannounced, "pre-emptive visit" he and others in the group
recently had made to Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going over there to confront her," he said. "We just
wanted her to know that part of her constituency has this opinion."</TE>
<TE>   He said Capps had received half a dozen letters from her
constituents supporting a prospective war in Iraq and hundreds
opposing it. Though she stood on the fence for weeks, when the House
of Representatives voted on Bush's war resolution, she was among 133
members to vote against it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the resolution passed with 296 votes in the House, and with
77 votes in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "You realize there are baby steps along the way," Dodge said. "You
have to look for small things."</TE>
<TE>   While much of Citizens for Peaceful Resolutions' energy now is
focused on protesting a war in Iraq, organizers said they also want
the group to last beyond any immediate conflict.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the group has hosted several events in addition to
regular monthly meetings, including a speaker from Peaceful Tomorrows
-- an anti-war group started by families of Sept. 11 victims -- and a
candlelight vigil to mark the bombing of Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the group took part in a community summit on the Earth
Charter, an international movement calling for development of a
peaceful, equitable and sustainable future.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not be able to influence what goes on in Washington, but
we can influence what goes on in Ventura County," said Paul Belgum, a
teacher at Pacifica Continuation High School in Ventura. "In that
way, we can have an effect right where we live."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge, 50, started out as an activist in the 1970s and '80s
against the nuclear arms race and the Cold War. He believes there are
large numbers of people from his generation who are starting to
politically reactivate.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that we're waking up," he said. "I have to feel like I
have done everything I can to try to change something. Then I can
sleep at night."</TE>

<LD>The jerky videotape plays like a local version of "The Blair Witch
Project." Dark and unfocused, it pans a crowded, shadowy street as
barely audible voices mutter barely intelligible things. The camera
settles on a clock reading 12:45 as the slightly more distinct voice
of a narrator explains.</LD>
<LD>   "It's 12:45 a.m.," the tired female voice says, "and they just got
out of the bar. They're loud -- we can't sleep. It'd be nice if we
could sleep, but we're all wide awake."</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the world of Anne Lemen: vacation cottage proprietor,
amateur videographer, self-described anti-chaos crusader and general
thorn in the side of the Village Inn, Balboa Island's only major bar
and almost-historic icon.</LD>
<TE>   Lemen's supporters -- numbering, she says, more than 400 in this
wealthy residential enclave of Newport Beach -- call her the Erin
Brokovich of Balboa, a designation she embraces.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors, including Aric Toll, who owns the restaurant-bar in
question, say she's a pest whose rantings have seriously hurt
business and prompted a judge's order to shut up.</TE>
<TE>   The Issues</TE>
<TE>   She says that patrons of the inn next door have kept her up all
hours by shouting obscenities, breaking windows and urinating in her
flowerbed. He says that that's all bunk: A doorman/bouncer keeps them
in line and, besides, his customers are among Balboa's finest.</TE>
<TE>   She says the loud music drives her insane and prompted her
daughter to drop out of high school; he says the noise is well within
the limits set by the city.</TE>
<TE>   She says the place is rife with prostitution, drug dealing or
worse; he calls such charges absurd fantasies leveled at an
establishment acting as a good neighbor and well within the law.</TE>
<TE>   He says she ought to have thought of all these things before
moving next door to what many consider the Cheers of Balboa. She says
would love to move but can't sell her property because, well, it's
right next door to the Cheers of Balboa.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the felon; I'm the town hero," says Lemen, 52.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm helping everyone's property values. I'm trying to save our
precious island."</TE>
<TE>   Counters Toll, 36, who took over ownership of the place two years
ago and is trying to make it thrive: "I can't get into her mind. She
has harassed the business and been a nuisance to this business. She
has been on a campaign of misinformation for many, many years."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation for those years was laid in 1928 when Anton and
Wilhelmina Hershey, German immigrants unrelated to the Hersheys of
chocolate fame, took jobs at the old Little Market at Park and
Marine, across the street from two lots on which the inn now stands.</TE>
<TE>   Anton, who had been a seller of houseplants in Germany, borrowed
$800 from several friends to buy the lots and turn them into a
nursery.</TE>
<TE>   Because Wilhelmina liked to cook, the couple added a small room to
serve hamburgers. With the repeal of prohibition in 1933, they
obtained a liquor license and called the place Hershey's Cafe and
German Beer Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Local legend has it that among the patrons were James Cagney,
Humphrey Bogart and Bing Crosby.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 65 years, the establishment was leased to a long
line of operators who ran it under various names, including the Park
Avenue Cafe, Whites Cafe, V.I.P. and, finally, the Village Inn. In
1998, owner Lance Wagner remodeled the interior, adding a new
kitchen, bar and dining room.</TE>
<TE>   And two years later, Toll, a chef, bought the place with the
intention of restoring it to some measure of its former glory.</TE>
<TE>   No one remembers exactly when the live music began. Lemen thinks
it was about 1990, the year after she bought the modest duplex next
door with the upstairs vacation rental she now calls Island Cot-
tage.</TE>
<TE>   But in the intervening years, she says, the erstwhile garden to
the stars has made a steady march away from sobriety and quietude
toward irritating Dionysian excess.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen 50 or more drunk people standing outside, screaming
obscenities, waiting for taxis," she says. "It's a different crowd, a
very nasty group. For the first time ever, we've had street fights.
The first thing I tried was crying myself to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   When that didn't work, Lemen drew up a petition protesting the
restaurant's request that its live entertainment permit be expanded
to include amplified drums and guitars. To bolster her case, she
started videotaping what she considered the excesses of Village Inn
customers on the streets in front of her house.</TE>
<TE>   By going door to door and talking to people on their lawns and
patios, Lemen says, she persuaded more than 400 to sign her petition.</TE>
<TE>   Then the he-said/she-said argument took a bitter turn: He said she
got those signatures by lying and slandering; she said that is a
slander and lie.</TE>
<TE>   "Previous owners had threatened to sue her," Toll says, "but never
followed through."</TE>
<TE>   He did, and last month won a Superior Court judgment instructive
in its wording. After listening to the testimony of various witnesses
regarding statements purportedly made by Lemen during her anti-Inn
campaign, Judge Gerald G. Johnston wrote: "The Court is convinced by
a preponderance of the evidence ... that [despite her denials] the
defendant did make the statements attributed to her."</TE>
<TE>   A Judge Rules</TE>
<TE>   Lemen, the judge went on, is therefore "prohibited from making the
following defamatory statements" to third parties: that the Village
Inn "sells alcohol to minors ... stays open until 6 a.m. ... makes
sex videos ... is involved in child pornography ... distributes
illegal drugs ... has Mafia connections ... encourages lesbian
activities ... participates in prostitution and acts as a whorehouse"
or "serves tainted food."</TE>
<TE>   Lemen denies ever saying any of those things and, anyway, promises
never to say them again. Her lawyer is appealing the ruling on the
basis that it violates her right of free speech.</TE>
<TE>   "It's prior restraint," attorney Michael Bush says. "It's
government censorship about what you can or cannot say in the future
-- that's 1st Amendment activity."</TE>
<TE>   City officials, while acknowledging the neighborhood crusader's
concerns regarding noise, describe the Village Inn as a worthwhile
establishment that's not a major offender.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big problem," said Sgt. Steve Shulman, a spokesman for
the Newport Beach Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We get an occasional call, but we get occasional calls on most
business establishments. I wouldn't consider it a chronic problem."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Wood, assistant city manager, described the Inn as an asset
to the people of Balboa. "I think, overall, it's a good place," she
said. "It's had problems from time to time, but I know that they are
working with us to resolve them. It's been there for so long, I
think, that it's a fixture in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Early last month, the city quietly approved the Village Inn's
application for expanded live entertainment, despite Lemen's
petition. And now, Toll says, he's trying to pack 'em in to help
rebound from the recent 25% decline in patronage he attributes to
Lemen's crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I can tell," he says, "she's affected three times as
many people as live on this entire island. She really hurt us --
we're still trying to recover from her petition."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Williams, 60, of Newport Beach said he has been coming to the
Village Inn for a while, mostly for the lively music and pretty
women.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I was 21," he said. "In those days it was ruled by the
jarheads, and all the girls were schoolteachers. Now it's kind of my
generation's place."</TE>
<TE>   The Village Inn's location is appropriate, Williams argued.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to have some entertainment somewhere. You can't have
it in the middle of the desert."</TE>

<HD>How to Get Clothes Clean?</HD>
<DH>A plan to phase out use of a popular solvent has stirred
protests from dry cleaners, mostly 'mom and pop' operations that
depend on it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called "perc" -- the smelly solvent your clothes soak in when
you take them to the dry cleaner. Although it has been removing
stains and keeping clothes crisp for nearly 50 years, air quality
officials are about to send it the way of leaded gasoline with the
nation's first proposed ban on the chemical.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal has provoked a furious response from hundreds of
cleaners and has consumers like Laura Boles of Northridge concerned
about how it will affect her clothes, her pocketbook and the
mom-and-pop Royalty Cleaners she frequents.</LD>
<LD>   "Anything that's good for the environment, I'm in favor of, but I
need to know what it's going to cost me," said Boles, hoisting a row
of wrapped plastic shirts into her car. "But I don't want to put the
little guys out of business. They have to make a living. It's got to
be right for everyone in terms of the environment, small business and
cost to the consumer."</LD>
<TE>   Regulators and others give assurances that costs will be
negligible and that there will be vast health benefits to workers and
people living near dry cleaners. Each soy stain removed from a blouse
or grease smudge lifted from a uniform releases a puff of toxic
vapor, an assault on the environment that new technologies would
remedy, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Perchloroethylene, the colorless solvent used by 85% of dry
cleaners in Southern California, poses an environmental threat to
more than the atmosphere. It also is the No. 1 contaminant of ground
water in Southern California, and some landlords won't renew leases
for dry cleaners because of liability concerns that perc may seep
into groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   Years of cutting down on the pollution has reduced the airborne
risk. But now Southern California air quality officials want to phase
out perc altogether over nearly 20 years. Industry groups nationwide
are closely watching the matter because, as is often the case, steps
that California takes to clean its dirty skies are copied nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't pay very much attention to the risk at dry cleaners.
People understand they use some kind of solvent, but the general
public is not aware dry cleaners are a problem," said Elaine Chang,
deputy executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District.</TE>
<TE>   Garments are immersed in a solvent bath of perc (pronounced
"perk"), releasing about 850 tons of emissions annually, air quality
officials said. Dry cleaners swear by the chemical, which can cut
through grease, blood and other tough stains.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fabulous. It has a combination of aggressively going after
stains without damaging fabric," said Jon Meijer, vice president of
the International Fabricare Institute, which represents cleaners
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike smog-forming chemicals, perc is a concern because it
has been linked to cancer of the kidney, liver and breast. It also
affects the central nervous system and can be absorbed through the
lungs and into the bloodstream. It can contaminate breast milk. One
recent study that traced 1,700 dry-cleaner workers found that the
risk of dying of cancer was 25% greater for them than for other
workers, said Avima Ruder, senior research epidemiologist for the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Heath.</TE>
<TE>   Dry cleaners emit about two-thirds of the perchloroethylene
emissions across Los Angeles, Orange and much of Riverside and San
Bernardino counties. A 2-year-old government study identifies perc as
one of six major toxic air contaminants in the Southland. Fumes from
dry cleaners that reach surrounding neighborhoods pose a cancer risk
as much as eight times as great as is deemed acceptable by the air
district.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed regulation, dry cleaners would be prohibited
from purchasing perchloroethylene machines after January 2003. In
July 2004, all cleaning machines scheduled for replacement would have
to switch to an alternative technology. By 2019, use of
perchloroethylene would no longer be permitted at dry cleaners in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the longest lead time allowed for compliance under any
Los Angeles-area air pollution control regulation. Officials said
that would give the industry plenty of time to make the switch. They
said switching is reasonable. There are many nontoxic, cost-effective
alternatives to perc. The measure is one of the most ambitious
anti-toxics regulations ever proposed for Southern California,
although New York City and the Bay Area already have stringent
controls on dry cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   Action Delayed</TE>
<TE>   The air district governing board is scheduled to consider the
measure at its regular meeting on Nov. 1 in Diamond Bar. But action
on the measure has been postponed many times this year because of
vigorous opposition rooted in concerns both economic and cultural.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials typically target major polluters, including
oil refineries, manufacturers and automakers, but the dry-cleaning
industry is overwhelmingly composed of small, family-run shops that
see themselves as no match for powerful government bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, most of the 2,086 dry cleaners in the region are owned
by Korean Americans, many of whom recently immigrated to the United
States. Many said they do not appreciate what the fuss is about.
Despite extensive use of translators, bilingual documents and extra
public meetings in Koreatown and other ethnic communities, government
and industry representatives have been unable to arrive at a
regulation both sides can embrace.</TE>
<TE>   "Korean immigrants, especially dry cleaners, see themselves as
small fish who are being attacked by a big fish. So initially, they
don't even understand this government regulation, what is the value,
so they just see this as an outrageous attack on small, mom-and-pop
operations. They see it as unfair," said Kayeyoung Park, professor of
anthropology and Asian American studies at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the proposal has been vigorous and is not expected
to subside by the time the air quality board meets in November. Dry
cleaners, as many as 350 at a time, denounced the plan at raucous
public workshops earlier in the year.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Choe came from Seoul in 1975. He opened a dry cleaner in
Lancaster after he lost his aerospace job at the end of the Cold War.
He is the vice president of the Korean Dry Cleaners Assn. of Southern
California and warns that the regulation "would hurt us badly."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a life-threatening situation," Choe said. "Most cleaners in
California are owned by minorities, and those people came to the
U.S.A. for the American dream. They've been working hard to support
their family and children from the cleaners, but if this law passes,
we're going to have to spend a lot of money and some cleaners won't
have money to replace a new machine. Some of them are going to go out
of business."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the dry cleaners question why they are being
regulated again after complying with rules that reduced emissions by
85% over the last decade. Many invested in new machines a few years
ago and are not eager to spend thousands of dollars on newer
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, industry representatives advocate deeper reductions in
emissions without banning perchloroethylene. The newest perc machines
can cut solvent fumes by 40%, and their use is being advocated by
industry groups, including Dow Chemical Co., Vulcan Materials Co. and
PPG Industries Inc., which make perc.</TE>
<TE>   Studies Questioned</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe perc should be banned. We believe perc is a very
safe solvent," Meijer said. He said that studies linking the chemical
to human cancer are questionable and that air quality officials
overestimate the amount of fumes released by dry cleaners in the L.A.
and surrounding regions.</TE>
<TE>   Many dry cleaners point out that some alternative cleaning
processes are more expensive too, including a machine that uses other
types of solvents but costs as much as $90,000 -- about 25% more than
a perc machine. That substitute also emits vapors: Although not
toxic, its emissions contribute to smog, the air quality district
said.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials said the regulation could cost dry cleaners
as much as $4.3 million annually, or about $2,525 per dry cleaner, if
businesses choose the most expensive technology, which is considered
unlikely. About 51 jobs would be lost annually, and consumers might
pay slightly more for dry-cleaning services, according to the air
quality district. The increased consumer prices would be less than a
penny on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a good rule, in that it gives time to make the
transition. There is technology out there now that is viable," said
Robert Gottlieb, director of the Environmental Policy Institute at
Occidental College. A 3-year research program at the school found
that new technologies are available that can clean clothes
efficiently and inexpensively without using toxic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   One promising method involves not dry cleaning at all, but "wet
cleaning" with water-based cleansers that produce no toxic emissions.
Tests show that system can cut energy costs by 45%, the machines cost
less than perchloroethylene machines and they can treat virtually all
modern fabrics.</TE>
<TE>   However, wet-cleaning machines are computer-guided and a bit
touchy to operate and clothes require more pressing. More than
one-third of the dry cleaners in Germany have gone to wet cleaning,
and 15% of the dry cleaners in the Bay Area use an alternative
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Other techniques use silicone-based cleansers and liquefied carbon
dioxide to clean clothes. The district governing board, under a
separate but related proposal, is scheduled to consider providing $2
million in grants to help dry cleaners shift to nontoxic methods.</TE>
<TE>   Moon K. Noh has already made the change. After arriving from South
Korea in 1958, he set up San Clemente Natural Cleaning Center, but
eventually he grew weary of solvent fumes and regulations on perc.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the smell of the perc. You smell it on you, you have
a headache pretty commonly. You open the machine and the fumes come
out of there and the smells and all the coughing," Noh said. "Now I
use wet cleaning. My customers enjoy it, I enjoy it, and my employees
enjoy it. I'm very happy and successful using it. Now I have no more
headaches, and I'm free from that."</TE>

<LD>The Superior Court trial starts today for an Oxnard man accused of
dissecting his young daughter's guinea pig while high on

<LD>   If convicted on the drug and animal cruelty charges, 34-year-old
Benny Zavala faces up to three years in state prison, but would

<TE>   "If the allegations against Zavala are accurate, then we believe
him to be in dire need of psychiatric intervention," wrote Martin
Mersereau, a Norfolk, Va., caseworker for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. "The safety of the community may depend on it."</TE>
<TE>   Zavala, who has been free on bail since shortly after his arrest

<LD>The Superior Court trial starts today for an Oxnard man accused of
dissecting his young daughter's guinea pig while high on
methamphetamine because he believed it was a government spy robot.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted on the drug and animal cruelty charges, 34-year-old
Benny Zavala faces up to three years in state prison, but would
likely only receive a year in county jail or probation because of his
clean record, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "He thought it was a robot that had a camera in the back of its
head, and that federal agents were watching him," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Tom Connors said in an interview.</LD>
<TE>   Zavala's attorney maintains that his client has been wrongly
accused. "He is innocent and I will prove that to the jury," said
Deputy Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt, who declined further
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case -- possibly the first felony prosecution in the area over
a rodent -- has drawn the attention of national animal-rights
advocates, who recently wrote to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   "If the allegations against Zavala are accurate, then we believe
him to be in dire need of psychiatric intervention," wrote Martin
Mersereau, a Norfolk, Va., caseworker for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. "The safety of the community may depend on it."</TE>
<TE>   Animal cruelty, according to Mersereau, can be a precursor to more
violent crimes. Zavala is charged with two counts of felony animal
cruelty and a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of
methamphetamine, a stimulant that can cause paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala, who has been free on bail since shortly after his arrest

<TE>   One woman was rejected after saying her religious beliefs include
worshiping animals, and a man was dismissed when he admitted killing
his family's guinea pig several years ago during a fit of rage. The
man said he deeply regretted throwing the animal against a wall in
his home and called the incident "the darkest moment of my life."</TE>
<TE>   A panel of eight women and four men, some pet owners and some not,
will hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Zavala was at home with his father the
night of Sept. 13, 2001, when he asked a neighbor over to his house.
In front of his father and the neighbor, Zavala allegedly poked at
"Guinea" with a knife and talked about a hidden camera inside.</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning, after the neighbor had left, Zavala is
accused of beating the guinea pig on the head with a screwdriver
before cutting it up and placing its eyes and brain inside small
glass jars.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a little unusual, for someone to be so paranoid," Connors
noted.</TE>
<TE>   After the dissection, Zavala called his neighbor and told her that
he now realized the animal wasn't a robot. The neighbor is expected
to testify that she notified mental health authorities, who called
police.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala allegedly told authorities that the guinea pig was diseased
and could no longer stand. A necropsy of the animal, Connors said,
revealed that it was severely malnourished. Starving, torturing or
maliciously killing an animal is a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys on both sides said they have several witnesses who will
testify, but that the trial should wrap up by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala's 6-year-old daughter lives with her mother and only saw
the guinea pig when she visited her father.</TE>

<HD>Missing Pilot Leaves Brother Alone in Quest</HD>
<DH>Matt and Tim Shubzda pursued the same goals. Now the elder
is one of four fliers lost in a crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LEMOORE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The plan was for younger brother to follow big brother all the way
from Texas to the naval air station in this San Joaquin Valley farm
town. Tim and Matt Shubzda were going to fly Super Hornets side by
side.</LD>
<LD>   It was part of the pact they had made as teammates on the football
squad at Naaman Forest High outside Dallas in the mid-1990s. Matt,
the star quarterback with the 4.26 GPA, would pave the way. Tim, two
years younger, would follow.</LD>
<LD>   So when Matt headed to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., Tim
was a step behind. When Matt suited up for the big Army-Navy game,
Tim lined up on the same kickoff team. When Matt graduated from
flight school in Mississippi, Tim entered flight school in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Tim, 25, was three weeks shy of earning his wings when he got the
call from their father on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Matt's Super Hornet had gone down off the California coast. He was
missing and presumed dead, along with three other members of the
Strike Fighter Squadron 41 from Lemoore Naval Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   "All my life I was a step behind him," Tim said Sunday as the
family gathered to prepare for a memorial service. "I was always just
trying to match him. Because I could never top him."</TE>
<TE>   It was a routine training mission for Lt. Matt "Shooby" Shubzda,
27, and seven fellow F/A-18F Super Hornet pilots from the "Black
Aces" squadron. They were simulating combat -- dog fighting -- when
two of the jets presumably collided and went down, about 80 miles
southwest of Monterey off the Big Sur coast.</TE>
<TE>   Two Coast Guard cutters, a helicopter and three commercial fishing
vessels combed 1,600 square miles before giving up their search
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Shubzda, the missing men were identified as Lt. Stephen
R. Nevarez, 31, of New Orleans; Lt. Joel Korkowski, 30, of Phoenix;
and Lt. Stephen N. Benson, 26, of Virginia Beach, Va.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first crash involving the Super Hornet since the Navy
began flying the combat jets in 1999. Shubzda was among the pilots
chosen to inaugurate the $57-million Super Hornet.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Jim, a 29-year veteran of the Dallas Police
Department, said he had never worried about his oldest boy. He seemed
to be blessed with a magical touch. Whether he was throwing a
football or manning a 33-ton flying machine, he made every challenge
look easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything clicked for him. Everything. He never uttered a word
that gave us a reason to question. 'I can fly these planes. I can
land on these carriers.'</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, we were braced in the event he was deployed and had to go
into battle. But a crash during training? It never entered my mind."</TE>
<TE>   His father remembers the day his son, a fifth-grader, came
face-to-face with his future. The family had gone to Pensacola for
vacation and took a tour of the Naval Museum. Hanging from the
rafters was a fighter jet with the pilot's name engraved on its side.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't take his eyes off it," his father said. "He said,
when he got older, he was going to put his own name on one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Back home in Garland, Texas, he grew to 6-foot-1, 215 pounds, and
became the captain of his high school football team and class
president. He was voted "Mr. Naaman Forest High." He was one of those
kids who never tested his father or his mother, Patti, family members
said. He set a high bar for his two younger brothers, Tim and Drew,
and his sister, Sara.</TE>
<TE>   Graduating sixth in his class, he had his choice among the Big
Three -- West Point, the Air Force or the Naval Academy. He thought
Annapolis offered him the best chance at football and flying.</TE>
<TE>   His coaches converted him into a defensive back, and he never
broke into the starting lineup. He played on special teams, but that
didn't stop him and brother Tim, who joined him at Navy in 1996, from
living out one of their dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the Navy kicker and we were lining up for the kickoff
against Army," Tim said. "There were 70,000 people in Philly stadium,
and I looked down the line and there was Matt."</TE>
<TE>   The two brothers got to travel back to Dallas and play Southern
Methodist in front of the hometown crowd.</TE>
<TE>   As Matt earned his wings and Tim entered flight school, they never
discussed the dangers of the job. Matt was too busy plotting a way
for Tim to join him in Lemoore when the younger brother got his
wings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Matt and his wife, Kim, high school sweethearts, were
making plans to convert their garage into a room for Tim. The
brothers last talked just before Matt's training mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still going to get my wings. It's just going to be a little
different without him there. And my goal is still to come back to
Lemoore and fly the Super Hornet," Tim said.</TE>

<HD>Yankee History Says Simon Hasn't Struck Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Want a real sporting proposition? Not the election, silly -- the
World Series, which this time around is the California series.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Simon, reading the tea leaves of series past, wants history
to repeat itself: By beating the Yankees, recent history says, the
come-from-behind Angels have given Simon a come-from-behind chance. A
Yankee win almost invariably means a Democrat takes California, but
when it's any team but the Yankees, the GOP fares well:</LD>
<LD>   1954: The Cleveland Indians beat the Yankees for the pennant, and
Goodwin Knight, the appointed GOP governor, wins in his own right.</LD>
<TE>   1958: The Yankees beat the Milwaukee Braves, Democratic Atty. Gen.
Pat Brown beats Republican Sen. Bill Knowland.</TE>
<TE>   1962: In a seventh-game squeaker, the Yankees beat the Giants, Pat
Brown beats Richard Nixon. As one sympathetic Simon e-mail said, had
Willie McCovey hit his line drive one foot higher, "Richard Nixon
would have won the election ... would not have given that awful
concession speech" -- the one about not having Nixon to kick around
any more, and this being his last election and all -- and he "would
not have moved to New York, would not have met John Mitchell," his
future felonious attorney general, "and, well, we know all the rest."
(Simon has not yet been seen in public wearing the NIXON sweatshirt
he was given recently after his latest speech at the Nixon Library.
Photographers are standing by.)</TE>
<TE>   1970: The Yankees are out of the race, the Orioles beat the
Dodgers, and Ronald Reagan beats Pat Brown. Four years later, the
Yankees are still down and out, the Orioles win again, and Reagan
beats Democratic Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh.</TE>
<TE>   1974: Oops! The Zen of Jerry kicks in; the Yankees lose but Jerry
Brown still beats Republican Houston Flournoy. Four years later, the
Yankees are back, and Jerry is governor, again.</TE>
<TE>   1982 and 1986: The Yankees are flat-lining again, and the GOP's
George Deukmejian beats the Democrats' Tom Bradley, twice.</TE>
<TE>   1990 and 1994: The Yankees are still dead, and Pete Wilson beats
two Democratic women: Dianne Feinstein in 1990 and Kathleen Brown in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   1998: The Yankees sweep the Padres, and Gray Davis sweeps Dan
Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   Now we have the Angels, who haven't ever been in the series, and
Simon, who hasn't ever run for office.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign has derided the notion of Simon's pinning
electoral hopes on baseball patterns, and both men should be aware of
homemade signs popping up in the Angels' stadium reading "Salmon for
governor" and "Scioscia for governor" -- the Angels' right fielder
and their manager.</TE>
<TE>   Money Trail Takes Some Odd Turns</TE>
<TE>   Now, for another kind of playing ball -- the kind that involves
dollar signs.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign filings show that, in September, the Simon campaign got
$25,000 from the "Lungren for Governor" operation -- a kind of dead
man's money, inasmuch as Lungren lost to Davis by 20 points four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another $1,000 made its way to Simon from Jon Iverson, the "tax
director" at Oracle Corp. in San Jose, Oracle being the company whose
contribution to Davis caused the governor much consternation earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   More money on the cash-parched Simon landscape came from simpatico
Orange County, where GOP rainmaker Ron Cedillos hosted about 100
people, who paid between $250 and $10,000 for the meet-and-greet.
Several attendees said privately they were aghast that Simon falsely
accused Gov. Gray Davis of taking a campaign check on state property.</TE>
<TE>   But they showed up loyally anyway, more for the sake of
down-ticket candidates who rely on voter pull from the ticket topper.
Cedillos' Laguna Niguel spread is the address for Orange County
political fundraisers -- why, it was there, in February, that
Cedillos hosted a "do" for his first choice for governor: Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Pitting Davis Against Rapper Vanilla Ice</TE>
<TE>   Whatever else the Simon campaign lacks -- money, political savvy
-- it has someone with a sense of humor. The latest
compare-and-contrast e-mail pits Gray Davis against passe white
rapper Vanilla Ice. There's the name (Vanilla vs. Gray), the hair
(QED), and "view of his place in the world":</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Ice: "I'm just a white guy trying to rap, and I got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Davis: "I'm just a poor working stiff."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail did not note, however, that both have gone platinum:
Ice with his music, Davis with his fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Angelenos who do the right thing and vote on Nov. 5 get a break:
Parking regulations near polling places will be suspended between 7
a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day so voters can take as much time as
they need to cast this year's lengthy, complex ballots. (Please, no
sneak-shopping. This is citizenship.)</TE>
<TE>   * Mosemarie Boyd, a former Davis administration aide who came in
fourth out of four in March's Democratic gubernatorial primary, says
both Republicans and Democrats should be "grateful" for Gray Davis'
prodigious fund-raising, for "protecting Californians from Bill
Simon." She cites his "ineffective attempts to use his personal
fortune to become governor."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hertzberg, of late the Assembly speaker, took the lectern at
Los Angeles Valley College to teach two free classes on using the
Internet to figure out California government, like filing taxes and
renewing auto registration online; students get a 46-page Internet
guide to California government.</TE>
<TE>   * Don Knabe, one of five Los Angeles County supervisors, is one of
eight appointed members to President Bush's Homeland Security
Advisory Council's State and Local Officials Senior Advisory
Committee. First task should be, shorten the job title.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mayor [Willie] Brown will look cute."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who bet San Francisco's Beau Brummel mayor
on the outcome of the World Series. If the Angels win, Brown will
wear a cowboy hat, the headgear of choice for the late Angels owner,
Gene Autry. If the Giants win, Tom Daly will wear a brown and orange
fedora in a style not unlike the one favored by the S.F. mayor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THUMBS DOWN: A lone protester, left, expresses his displeasure
with the gubernatorial campaign of Republican Bill Simon Jr. In right

Marguerita Casillas march in front of the Ronald Reagan Federal
Building in downtown Los Angeles to protest Gov. Gray Davis' veto of
a bill that would have allowed some illegal immigrants who are
longtime residents to receive driver's licenses. The decision forced
Davis to weigh what he said were increased security risks from
licensing noncitizens after last year's terrorist attacks against the
interests of groups supporting driving rights for illegal immigrants.</TE>

<HD>Red Cross Chapter Plans Layoffs, End of Transit Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dogged by scandal and a criminal investigation, the San Diego chapter
of the Red Cross has announced that it will lay off half of its
employees and get out of the business of providing transportation to
the region's elderly and disabled.</LD>
<LD>   The charity, which was fired Thursday by the region's biggest
transit agency, also admitted that it had altered records to earn
bonuses for on-time service that it was not entitled to receive.</LD>
<LD>   It was yet another blow to an organization that has been reeling
from controversies in which elected officials have publicly accused
the charity of fraud and mismanagement. The San Diego County district
attorney is also investigating whether officials broke the law.</LD>
<TE>   "I think what's so disappointing is that these things continue to
happen," said Ron Roberts, chairman of the county Board of
Supervisors. "Instead of cleaning up the problems, they're covering
up the problems, still."</TE>
<TE>   He added that while public confidence in the Red Cross is not
irreparably shattered, "it's getting very close to that point."</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross officials said Friday that they are determined to turn
the organization around.</TE>
<TE>   They said that they will cooperate fully with investigators, and
that the agency is returning to its basic mission of providing
disaster services, safety education and military communications.
Other agencies will provide transportation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heart-wrenching," interim Chief Executive Carter Taylor said
of laying off 260 employees who were involved in transportation
services.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was brought in this summer to clean up the chapter after
the National Red Cross took the unusual step of replacing the
previous chief executive and board of directors. Getting out of
transportation services "is the right thing to do for this
organization, and we will refocus on our core mission," he said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's Red Cross has provided bus services to the elderly and
disabled across the region for two decades, contracting with 12
agencies and making an average of 2,000 trips a day over the last few
years, Taylor said. Funding came from local government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But earlier this year, the Metropolitan Transit Development board,
the region's largest transit agency, began to receive complaints
about impossibly long waits.</TE>
<TE>   "Very poor service was being provided," said Roberts, who also
sits on the transit development board.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, allegations surfaced that Red Cross staff had altered
records to make it appear that drivers showed up on time more often
than they did.</TE>
<TE>   In early October, the district attorney's office launched a probe
into the altered records, Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're concerned about is whether or not the county is
overbilled for services, and whether or not the overbilling is tied
into the executive compensation packages," Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   After their internal investigation, Red Cross officials admitted
that on-time records had been altered. They subsequently decided to
get out of the transportation business.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will phase out gradually, officials said, to give other
agencies time to pick up the contracts. The charity also promised to
return any money it had been paid improperly and to help laid off
employees find work.</TE>
<TE>   But the move may not be enough for elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought when the Red Cross came in and eliminated the local
board, that might be the beginning of the turnaround, but it hasn't,"
said Supervisor Diane Jacob, an outspoken critic of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm real disappointed. I don't know how deep the fraud is, but in
my opinion, this organization needs a thorough housecleaning."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob's disillusionment began after the Alpine fire, which burned
five homes and displaced 500 residents in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross responded immediately, setting up a disaster center
for evacuees, and donations flooded in from people who watched the
flames on their televisions. The Red Cross said it received about
$344,000.</TE>
<TE>   But days after the fire, Jacob said she began to get calls from
residents who had been denied services from the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   "And then to add insult to injury, the Red Cross used the fire
victims to solicit donations," she said. Her office said one woman
was denied counseling services, only to find her picture on a Red
Cross Web site urging donors to send money to help fire victims.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob complained to the National Red Cross, and an audit of the
Alpine fire funds was launched. The chapter released an abbreviated
version of the audit, which did not contain the Alpine fire, Jacob
said.</TE>
<TE>   But when the supervisor got her hands on the original audit, she
said it was stinging in its criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross spokeswoman Sue Irey said the agency had not intended to
cover up the audit, but had merely sent its board of directors a
shortened version. She said the agency has paid out more than
$270,000 to families affected by the fire and is continuing to work
with the community to use the rest of the money for disaster
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "The Red Cross is saying, 'OK, we have some management problems,
and we are working hard to make corrections,' " Irey said. But she
said things are going to improve, and that the agency should be
commended for correcting its mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need an organization like the Red Cross," Supervisor Roberts
said. "And all of us, deep down inside, would like to see things get
turned around.... My hope is that they will go through everything
with a fine-toothed comb and clear the air."</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Issues Cloud Santa Ana School Races</HD>
<DH>Eight are competing for two seats. Among them are two
incumbents in a board majority that's a lightning rod for
controversy.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana school board member Nativo Lopez describes the Nov. 5
election in epic terms.</LD>
<LD>   "This," said the besieged trustee, "is a fight for the soul of
Santa Ana."</LD>
<LD>   That's about the only thing he and his detractors are likely to
agree on.</LD>
<TE>   In one of the most Latino cities in the nation, the school board
election campaigns have turned into a rancorous referendum on ethnic
politics, with such charged issues as bilingual education and
socioeconomic differences thrown in.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, midway into his second term, isn't even on the ballot --
yet. But a months-long recall campaign against him, poised for a
showdown at the polls as early as January, is intricately linked to a
broader challenge to the board's current majority.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees John Palacio and Nadia Maria Davis, viewed by many as
Lopez's allies on the five-member Santa Ana Unified board, face tough
reelection opposition in the Nov. 5 balloting. They are among eight
candidates vying for two seats. The top two vote getters win.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio, Davis and Lopez maintain that they are independent
leaders with overlapping agendas, but their political opponents see
them as a collective target.</TE>
<TE>   "If John or Nadia are reelected, we'll immediately file for their
recall," said Tim Whitacre, a campaign strategist for the group
seeking Lopez's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   The critics charge that Lopez and Palacio, with quiet assent from
Davis, have incited ethnic discord in the district by painting any
opposition to the board majority -- be it over bilingual education or
where to build new schools -- as an attack on Latino working
families.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever they need to gather support for their cause, the race
card is pulled," said Robert Munoz, a social worker and Latino
candidate for the school board who said he finds offensive the notion
that people should align along ethnic lines. "We need to think of the
district as a whole," he said. "We need to look at the city as a
whole."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Santa Ana, with its central location and relatively
cheap housing, has been a draw for immigrants, mostly from Mexico.
More than half of the city's population is foreign-born, and 76% is
Latino. The burgeoning population -- from 200,000 in 1980 to 340,000
now -- has strained the capacity of schools. More than 80% of Santa
Ana campuses have more students than they were designed for.</TE>
<TE>   If the city is majority Latino, Santa Ana public schools are
overwhelmingly so. Of the district's 62,000 students, 92% are Latino,
and 65% speak primarily Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   It is to serve this larger Latino constituency that Lopez, a
longtime immigrant-rights activist, ran for the school board in 1996,
he said. His election came at the same time Loretta Sanchez defeated
veteran conservative Robert K. Dornan for the 46th Congressional
District seat in central Orange County and seemed to signal a surge
in Latino political participation. Since then, other Latinos have won
seats on both the Santa Ana school board and City Council, but the
two elected bodies have often been at odds. Competing visions from
City Hall and the school board in many ways illustrate the city's
struggle with ethnicity, class and political representation.</TE>
<TE>   When the crowded district -- which passed a $145-million bond in
1999 to build new schools and upgrade and expand existing ones --
tried to buy a vacant lot in the city's north end, many residents in
the relatively affluent surrounding neighborhoods cried foul. They
said the campus, named after conservative former Mayor Lorin Griset,
would serve few children in their neighborhoods and bring traffic and
pollution to their quiet streets. Munoz was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to bring the schools to where the children are, not the
children to where the schools are," the candidate said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council, which had approved a luxury home complex for the
9-acre lot, sided with residents. City officials continue to suggest
that the district buy and tear down some apartments elsewhere for new
schools or build on existing campuses instead of forcing projects on
resistant neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The district took the property anyway -- through eminent domain --
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Palacio, elected in 1998, see in city officials'
priorities a barely disguised effort to shift the burden to their
students and Latino immigrant families, many of whom live in the sort
of apartments the city suggests demolishing. They charge that City
Hall, despite being led by Mayor Miguel Pulido, a Latino, is
dominated by the interests of an entrenched establishment more
interested in gentrification than the welfare of its lower-income
Latino residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We represent the present and the future of Santa Ana," Palacio
said. "Mayor Pulido represents the past."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, for her part, said she is trying to be a unifying force.
She shares Palacio and Lopez's dedication to serving Latino and
immigrant families, she said, but disagrees with what she calls their
divisive styles.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything has to be tinged with an ethnic cast, Davis said.
"The community has progressed beyond that. We need to approach things
differently."</TE>
<TE>   Her stance has been derided by people in both camps who say Davis
lacks the courage to choose a side.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is the maturation of a political process,"
said political science professor Sandra Sutphen of Cal State
Fullerton. As more Latinos assert themselves politically, it
diversifies Latino voices.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the six challengers are Latinos: Besides the incumbents
and Munoz, they are city library commissioners Oscar Garza and Lupe
Moreno, and parent activist Roland Lujan. Former trustee Audrey Y.
Noji, a college administrator, and retired teacher Nina Brazelton are
also in the running. All the challengers say the board majority is a
divisive force in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the complexity of Santa Ana politics, four of the
candidates said they have Mayor Pulido's support: Davis, Noji, Garza
and Moreno. The mayor did not return several calls requesting an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates' campaigns have consisted mostly of door-to-door
outreach to potential voters, political signs placed on residential
lawns and some meet-and-greet events.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters allege that Lopez has promoted bilingual
education in the district in defiance of Proposition 227, the 1998
voter-approved ballot measure that curtailed bilingual instruction in
California classrooms. It's a charge that Lopez denies.</TE>
<TE>   He points out that 90% of the district's students are in English
immersion or English mainstream classes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, recall proponents have gathered enough signatures to force
a special election. Lopez has vowed to challenge the legality of
those signatures. And he contends that the recall would have gone
nowhere without support from residents opposed to the new Lorin
Griset school.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who back the recall do live near the proposed school
site, but they say their alliance is not just about the new school or
bilingual education. The current board majority, they charge, is more
interested in race baiting for its political survival than teaching
children.</TE>
<TE>   That frustrates Vivian Martinez, a Latina parent in the district
who joined others earlier this year in filing a recall petition
against Lopez. "That's all we hear from them, that it is about race,"
she said. "I am tired of it. It is not about race. It is about
education."</TE>
<TE>   Though Santa Ana students have consistently gained in standardized
tests, they remain some of the poorest performing in the state. This
year, roughly a third of students scored at or above the national
average in the Stanford 9 tests, according to a Times' analysis of
aggregate scores. That's up almost 12% from four years ago. But less
than a quarter are proficient or better in state standards for
English-language arts.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Al Mijares said the district is moving in the right
direction despite challenging demographics. But he agrees that the
battles are a distraction. "It does create stress and is a huge
consumer of energy," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Many backers of the current board, which also includes first-term
incumbent Sal Tinajero, who was elected in 2000, say the district has
finally become more reflective of its demographics, something parents
have demanded for years. The percentage of Latino district
administrators, for example, has risen from 22% four years ago to
40%.</TE>
<TE>   The board also has diversified its pool of contractors to include
more minority-owned firms. But critics such as fellow trustee and
frequent dissenter Rosemarie Avila see in such moves an effort to
consolidate political power by lining up potential campaign donors
rather than serving the interests of the district.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio, the board president, maintains that all contracts went to
qualified firms. Still, the appearance of constant political
maneuvering has vexed many.</TE>
<TE>   "They think it is OK to do anything," said one district official,
"because the cause is noble."</TE>

when he was attacked, said Oxnard Police Cmdr. Joe Munoz.</LD>
<LD>   He was stabbed once in the back with an unknown object and was
taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center with minor to moderate

<HD>There Are No Angels in Soccer Fans' Heaven</HD>
<DH>L.A.'s Galaxy wins the league championship as backers watch
on TVs at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angels? What Angels?</LD>
<LD>   Galaxy fans wept, whooped and embraced Sunday as their team won
Major League Soccer's championship title in sudden death overtime,
breaking a losing streak that brought them to the MLS Cup title match
three times before to no avail.</LD>
<LD>   In the shadow of baseball's championship, about 400 of the Los
Angeles soccer team's die-hard fans had their own moment of glory.
Festooned in Galaxy garb, chanting at dozens of television screens in
English and Spanish, the fans gathered at Staples Center's Arena Club
to cheer their young team through a nail-biting match thousands of
miles away in Foxboro, Mass.</LD>
<TE>   The World Series might as well have been happening in another
galaxy. But amid the elation, there was still room for some ribbing
from baseball's self-described "stepchildren."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to wait for the Angels. Now we have a champion
team," said Mauricio Mejia, 39, of Pasadena, who brought his two sons
to Staples.</TE>
<TE>   In the giddy post-game glory, Jose Gonzalez, 38, of Reseda broke
out a can of white shoe polish and happily scrawled "GALAXY, 1-0, MLS
CHAMPION" on the rear window of his Ford minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep forgetting about us," he said. "This is the biggest
sport in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy faced off Sunday with the New England Revolution for
the American domestic title. The win broke a hex that some compared
with the unlucky streak that plagued the Anaheim Angels before that
team's recent good fortune. Next, the Galaxy will vie on Oct. 24 for
the other American cup -- the U.S. Open Cup final -- which it has won
before.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples, Cesar Garcia, a 34-year-old cabdriver from Studio
City, paced in frustration as the scoreless game headed into
overtime, perspiring in his Mauricio Cienfuegos jersey. When forward
Carlos Ruiz kicked the overtime goal to win the game, tears flowed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot of happiness, a lot of emotion. It's the first time
out of four that they've managed to win," said Garcia, who like
midfielder Cienfuegos grew up in El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the same fans had gathered here before dawn in June to
watch Germany play in the World Cup. A self-described "underground
subculture," they are a proud minority.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in the shadow of baseball," said Art Kempf of West
Hollywood. "Baseball is not on my radar screen."</TE>
<TE>   Kempf has traveled the world to view 60 U.S. soccer matches with
his girlfriend, Joy Mallory -- a former Peace Corps volunteer in
Burkina Faso--since she got him hooked on the sport in 1994. Now, the
couple views it as a form of global detente.</TE>
<TE>   "We've partied with Iranians, Iraqis, Turks and Romanians," said
Mallory, who embraced soccer in Africa as the only form of
entertainment available to her. "Americans are so insular. The World
Series is a U.S. baseball series and they call it the World Series.
It's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   There were also words of disdain for baseball's near-strike and
sky-high salaries. "After awhile, you just get tired of all the other
prima donna sports," said Sam Nishi, 40, of Los Angeles. "Here the
players play for the love of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   Nishi has been a volunteer since the beginning for the Galaxy,
compiling game-day statistics. Nishi now gets paid "enough for gas"
and has watched the team's fan base burgeon, albeit slowly. That will
only improve when the Galaxy moves next season to the Home Depot
National Training Center in Carson, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago, they wouldn't have been able to pull this off,"
Nishi said, gazing at an Arena Club packed with fans.</TE>
<TE>   Given a choice, Nishi said, he would have chosen the midday
Staples fan party over a trip to Edison Field. Others were equally
proud of their beloved Angels, but peeved nevertheless at the World
Series for hogging the party.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the timing of all this is kind of stinky," said Claudia
Hartwig, of Glendale, who along with her husband and two young
daughters holds season Galaxy tickets and has traveled the country to
support the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to enjoy this, but a sports fan has to divide their
loyalties.... I wish the MLS had selected a different weekend."</TE>

<HD>Quality of Life, Crime the Talk of Valley Race</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curtis A. Page remembers growing up in North Hills when farmers grew
pumpkins and corn and enterprising youngsters collected frogs. In
those days, kids fearlessly trick-or-treated and played hide-and-seek
with everyone else on the block.</LD>
<LD>   But as years went by, crime and graffiti seeped into the
community. Neighborhoods became divided. People stopped taking
evening strolls and started triple-locking their doors.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Page, 44, is one of four candidates for city council in the
2nd District of a proposed San Fernando Valley city. He is the first
to admit that he lacks political experience.</LD>
<TE>   "Politically, I'm probably the least qualified," said Page, a
shipping manager for a 3-D eyewear company. "But I have a lot of
heart."</TE>
<TE>   Page also has ideas about how to transform his community into the
kind of place where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to bring pride back to neighborhoods," said Page, who
also teaches karate at the North Valley YMCA. "We have too many
divisions, ethnically and economically. We need to bridge those
gaps."</TE>
<TE>   For Page, that means quashing crime and providing more parks and
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The 2nd District includes most of Sylmar and Mission Hills and a
chunk of North Hills. On Nov. 5, Valley voters will choose city
council members and a mayor. On the same day, voters citywide will
decide whether the Valley will become independent. If the secession
measure passes, council members would take office in July.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which is 70% Latino, is bordered on the west by the
Golden State Freeway and San Diego Freeway. At its most eastern
point, it hugs the city of San Fernando. The district reaches just
above the Foothill Freeway to the north and stretches below Nordhoff
Street to the south.</TE>
<TE>   All four candidates believe crime, lack of economic opportunities
and quality-of-life issues are the most pressing concerns for voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Public safety is the No. 1 issue," said Oscar R. Mendoza, 28, a
Sylmar resident who works at his family-run roofing business.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to beefing up police presence, Mendoza, a graduate of
Cal State Northridge, said he would like to set up a home-loan
assistance program to encourage police officers and firefighters to
live where they work.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza also hopes to start a program that would pair young people
with business leaders, who would act as mentors. If youngsters had a
greater investment in the community, Mendoza believes, they would be
less likely to join gangs.</TE>
<TE>   In the war against crime, Richard. K. Yamauchi, a 54-year-old
certified public accountant, said the district has been hurt by the
lack of community-based policing and inadequate patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand we have problems with the budget, but maybe we can
better use our resources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yamauchi, a graduate of Cal State Northridge, teaches taxes and
accounting at Mission College, College of the Canyons and Woodbury
University. Married 28 years and the father of four sons, Yamauchi
has lived in the Valley since 1973. Areas near his house in Sylmar
still have unpaved streets and lack sidewalks, Yamauchi said.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Yamauchi would work to fix those quality-of-life
problems and another thorny one: graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Yamauchi believes that his community work sets him apart from the
other candidates. He has volunteered at the Japanese American
Citizens League, Kiwanis Club, Sylmar Chamber of Commerce, a battered
women's shelter and a neighborhood safety program.</TE>
<TE>   Yamauchi seeks to simplify the business license tax, which he said
could result in a higher compliance rate. That would bring in more
money and tax rates could be lowered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In crafting a crime-fighting strategy, Daryl G. Pruett, 34, of
Mission Hills said he would look at other cities that have made their
streets feel safe. In addition, he said he would clean up city parks
so they were more inviting places.</TE>
<TE>   Pruett, a computer systems administrator, decided to run for
office because, "I got tired of complaining about everything that
never got done."</TE>
<TE>   Having experienced the frustration of trying to get problems
solved, Pruett said, as an elected official he would be "easily
approachable. I would take the time to hear what people say."</TE>

<LD>A Port Hueneme man was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of
attempted murder following the severe beating of his girlfriend near
her residence.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Williams, 23, was arrested at gunpoint by Ventura police
officers who responded to neighbors' calls about a domestic violence
incident occurring about midnight in the 5200 block of Shenandoah
Street. When police arrived, they said Williams was outside and
continued to strike the 22-year-old woman with his hands and feet.</LD>
<LD>   "Witnesses at the scene were shocked at the amount of injuries she
had," said Lt. David Wilson. "To have a domestic disturbance this
severe is not normal."</LD>
<TE>   The woman, whom authorities did not identify, was taken to Ventura
County Medical Center. Wilson said she remained in critical condition
late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is being held in lieu of $1 million bail. He is scheduled
for arraignment Tuesday afternoon.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are searching for a gunman who forced his way into a residence
in the 1700 block of North 6th Place on Saturday night and attempting
to rob a family living there.</LD>
<LD>   Answering a knock at the door shortly before 10 p.m., Angel and
Juanita Gonzalez were confronted by a Spanish-speaking man with a
mustache. He was in his mid-20s, 5 foot 7, with a medium build,
police said. The man pushed his way into the home, flashed a
semiautomatic handgun and told the couple to lie on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Juanita Gonzalez ran into her bedroom and called police.
The man fled, without taking anything, after other family members
told him authorities would soon arrive.</LD>

<HD>Clipper Picture Remains Fuzzy</HD>
<DH>Barely a week before start of season, team is without a
cable-TV deal. As of now, only 35 games scheduled to be shown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine days before opening one of their most anticipated seasons since
arriving in Los Angeles from San Diego in 1984, the Clippers are
still without a cable television deal. Talks with Fox Sports Net
continue, the team and the cable network say, but there is a distinct
possibility that the season will begin without a resolution.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers' growing legion of fans figures to be the big loser
if that's the case.</LD>
<LD>   As it stands now, fans will have only 25 opportunities to watch
the team on Channel 5. The Clippers also are scheduled to appear six
times on national cablecasts on ESPN and four on TNT. Three games
will be shown in Spanish on the Telemundo network, but those games
also will be aired by Channel 5.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, the Clippers disappointed many local fans without
cable by failing to secure an over-the-air deal when negotiations
broke off with Channel 9.</TE>
<TE>   Between them, Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2 showed 40 of 82
games last season, when the Clippers went 39-43 and finished ninth in
the Western Conference, their best season since posting a 41-41 mark
in 1992-93. They were 45-37 in 1991-92.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't made much progress lately, but we're still talking,"
said Andy Roeser, Clipper vice president. "We've enjoyed a great
relationship with Fox and hope to continue it."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the team nor officials from Fox wished to comment further
on what could turn out to be the worst TV package offered by any team
in the NBA. Most NBA teams have all of their games televised, either
over the air or on cable.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net outlets around the country show all but a few NBA
teams' games. The Portland Trail Blazers are on Action Sports Net,
the Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards are on Comcast and the
New Orleans Hornets and Phoenix Suns are on local cable outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that the Clippers ended last season with 16
consecutive sellout crowds at Staples Center, and a franchise-record
25 overall, the opportunities for fans to see the team will be
limited if a cable deal is not completed.</TE>
<TE>   As ever, money appears to be an issue, but it's apparently not the
only holdup. The Clippers are believed to be seeking a Laker-like
deal, with all games on Fox Sports Net 2 except those shown by
Channel 5, ESPN and TNT. Officials at Fox Sports Net would like to
complete a deal similar to the one that just expired -- with about 40
games available to cable viewers this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are attempting to secure a bigger and better deal
with Fox Sports Net based upon their potential as a team they feel
could challenge the Lakers, Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks for
Western Conference supremacy. Officials at Fox are believed to have
focused on the Clippers' track record as also-rans.</TE>
<TE>   The youthful Clippers last season gained a national following with
the determined play of power forward Elton Brand, the outside
shooting of Quentin Richardson and Eric Piatkowski and the
high-flying dunks of Darius Miles.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers during the off-season traded Miles, 20, to the
Cleveland Cavaliers to get point guard Andre Miller, the NBA's leader
in assists last season. Some observers believe Miller to be the final
piece of a puzzle that could have the Clippers winning as many as 50
games and traveling deep into the playoffs. Less optimistic forecasts
have the Clippers posting a winning record and advancing to the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters is the NBA's new $2.4-billion deal with AOL
Time Warner, parent company of TNT, and the Walt Disney Co., which
owns ESPN. The new contract allows competition in local markets,
which figures to dilute ratings. That means local rights on Fox
Sports Net would not be worth as much as in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, for example, a Clipper game on TNT would be blacked
out to Southland viewers if it also was shown on Fox Sports Net. Now,
games will be available on both networks.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a win-win situation for Clipper fans, who turned out
at Staples Center in record numbers last season. The average
attendance of 18,053 was a franchise record, topping the previous
record of 14,621 set in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' attendance increase per game was the third-highest
in the NBA last season, trailing only the 5,097 for Michael Jordan
and the Washington Wizards and the 3,743 for the rejuvenated Detroit
Pistons.</TE>

<HD>Goal Resonates for McDonald</HD>
<DH>He is face down on the ice after scoring game-winner for
Ducks in 3-2 overtime win over Colorado, and hears only crowd
reaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy McDonald never saw the goal. His first clue was the reaction
from a cozy group of spectators at the Arrowhead Pond on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   By the time McDonald's chip shot went in to give the Mighty Ducks
a 3-2 overtime victory over the Colorado Avalanche, he was face down
on the ice, courtesy of a Joe Sakic shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   "I never saw it," McDonald said. "I heard the crowd, that is good
enough for me."</LD>
<TE>   Faint praise, indeed, volume-wise anyway. As much sound that an
announced 12,838 could make was a relief to the Ducks, who overcame
two Sakic goals and the fact they let a 2-1 lead slip away in the
third period for the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a huge win for us," McDonald said. "I think we played
one of our better games and, even though they tied it up in the
third, it was nice to come out with a win to reflect how we played."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who gave up a late goal in a 2-2 tie with Vancouver on
Friday, surrendered another 2-1 lead Sunday, when Sakic fired in a
shot with eight minutes left. That became less of a concern when Mike
Leclerc slipped a pass to a charging Ruslan Salei, whose shot was
stopped by goalie David Aebischer.</TE>
<TE>   The rebound went right to McDonald, who was momentarily alone on
the left.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they lost me," said the 5-foot-10 McDonald. "Or they were
on a line change. The puck bounced off the goalie and rolled a little
bit. There was a guy all over me. I was just happy to get a fairly
decent shot on net."</TE>
<TE>   The goal ended a game that gave high marks to what General Manager
Bryan Murray did on his summer vacation, an essay that could be read
on the stat sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav Chistov, the Ducks' first-round pick in 2001, came from
Russia in June and was signed in July. He gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead
in the first period by lurking near the right post and sweeping in a
puck that trickled into the crease after an Aebischer save.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Oates, signed as a free agent, and Petr Sykora, acquired in a
trade, were here to make the offense, particularly the power, better.
On a second-period power play, Sykora took an Oates pass at the point
and zipped a shot past Aebischer for his first goal as a Duck and a
2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Sauer, the juniors-to-the-NHL defenseman, was basically
stolen from Colorado over the summer. He was a third-round pick in
2000, but the Avalanche was unable to sign him and he was declared a
free agent. The Ducks bid $1.102 million, the Avalanche $900,000,
which left Sauer facing those who could have been his teammates
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, when Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg are coming down the
ice, you really don't have time to think, 'Hey, this is the team that
drafted me,' " Sauer said. "You're a little busy."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer got busy in overtime, chasing down Forsberg, who had a
breakaway in overtime. Sauer got back and harassed Forsberg enough to
force a poor shot attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see it's No. 21 on a breakaway, you better get going,"
Sauer said.</TE>
<TE>   And, in the end, there was McDonald, a pet player of Murray's last
season. McDonald was demoted to the minors during training camp, then
recalled three times, sticking in December. He played well enough to
be rewarded with a two-year, $1.225-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   A bargain rate, considering McDonald leads the Ducks with six
points this season, after a goal and an assist against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see a big difference in Andy this season," team captain
Paul Kariya said. "He was one of the earliest cuts last year, but
continued to work and persevered and now look at him."</TE>

<HD>Swiss Goalies Gerber, Aebischer Become Part of NHL Trivia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This game certainly echoed through the Alps. For the first time, two
goalies from Switzerland -- the Mighty Ducks' Martin Gerber and
Colorado's David Aebischer -- faced each other.</LD>
<LD>   Gerber, a 28-year-old rookie in his first NHL start, was solid,
making 22 saves, which included deflecting a Peter Forsberg shot on a
breakaway in the first period. Aebischer stopped 24 of 27 shots in
the Ducks' 3-2 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I think there might be a couple newspapers in Switzerland that
write about this," Gerber said.</LD>
<TE>   Gerber has known Aebischer for seven years and the two were
teammates on Switzerland's team at the Olympics in February. That
factored into Duck Coach Mike Babcock's decision to start Gerber.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that it would be a big deal and I knew [Martin] would be
fired up against him," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Which gives Gerber the edge. He said he faced Aebischer four times
while playing juniors in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "We both won two, this makes me one up," Gerber said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   There have been only three Swiss goalies in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck left wing Kevin Sawyer was given a game misconduct in the
first period, after a scrum along the boards that involved several
players. Sawyer received a roughing penalty and a major penalty for
boarding, as well as the misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I hit him from behind or something like that,"
Sawyer said. "I just finished my check, that's my job. I didn't even
see the number of the guy, which shows I didn't hit him from behind."</TE>

<HD>Former Indian Harder Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Mel Harder, who won 223 games during a 20-year career with the
Cleveland Indians and pitched against such greats as Babe Ruth and
Joe DiMaggio, died Sunday. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Harder died at his home in Chardon, Ohio, about 25 miles east of
Cleveland, at 3:30 a.m. local time, according to his grandson, Dan
Itschner. He was in failing health the last few years, and was
hospitalized a year ago with pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   Harder appeared in four All-Star games from 1934-37 and didn't
give up an earned run in 13 innings -- a record that still stands.
The right-hander won one game and saved two others.</LD>
<TE>   From 1928-47, he was one of the American League's most consistent
pitchers. Harder won 15 or more games eight times and had 20-win
seasons in 1934 and 1935.</TE>

request for The Tin Man, a 4-year-old gelding who will arrive in
suburban Chicago on Tuesday to make final preparations for his
appearance Saturday in the Breeders' Cup Turf.</LD>
<LD>   Mandella needed a window.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, a window," Mandella said. "The Tin Man likes to be able to
look over at the horse in the next stall. It helps him relax."</LD>
<TE>   Cilio hired a carpenter at Arlington and told Mandella that The
Tin Man would have his window by the time he gets there.</TE>
<TE>   Clockers caught The Tin Man in :59 4/5 Sunday as he worked five
furlongs on dirt at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little quicker than I wanted," Mandella said. "But it's
still a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Although The Tin Man has won two of his last three starts,
including the Hirsch Memorial at Santa Anita on Oct. 6, he will be a
longshot for the $2-million Turf, which drew only nine horses, its
smallest field since 1986. The Europeans High Chaparral and Golan are
expected to be the favorites.</TE>
<TE>   The Tin Man will be ridden by Mike Smith, who has ridden eight
Breeders' Cup winners and with six mounts Saturday could have a big
day. Smith's other assignments are Came Home (Classic), Azeri
(Distaff), Vindication (Juvenile), Composure (Juvenile Fillies) and
Kalookan Queen (Sprint).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aidan O'Brien, who trains High Chaparral, was undecided about
Tomahawk, Ontario and Marino Marini running back in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile after they finished second, sixth and seventh Saturday in
the Darley Dewhurst Stakes in Newmarket, England. Tout Seul, a 25-1
shot, won the race.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien definitely plans to run Hold That Tiger and Van Nistelrooy
in the Juvenile, which he won last year with Johannesburg. Marino
Marini and Ontario are on the also-eligible list and would need
scratches in order to draw in. Tomahawk, a $2.5-million Seattle Slew
yearling, is assured a spot if O'Brien decides to run him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lido Palace, withheld from the Breeders' Cup Classic because of an
$800,000 supplementary fee that was needed to make him eligible, won
an allowance race by a half-length at Belmont Park.... Puxa Saco,
making her first start outside of Florida, was a one-length winner of
the $81,600 Anoakia Stakes at Santa Anita.... The breakdown of a
transformer resulted in a power outage at Hollywood Park, where
simulcast betting on the races at Santa Anita and Los Alamitos was
canceled.</TE>

<HD>After the Accident</HD>
<DH>Golf helps Long Beach Wilson's Tangtiphaiboontana keep life
on course, nearly a year after both parents die in crash</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana plays golf because it helps her to remember
-- and because it allows her to forget. She plays because her parents
dreamed she would someday make it to the top and, even though they
are not here to see it anymore, she wants to make them proud.</LD>
<LD>   Ittisak and Uthaivan Tangtiphaiboontana were driving Jenni and a
Long Beach Wilson High teammate home from the Southern Section team
golf championships in Calimesa last November when they died in a
single-car accident.</LD>
<LD>   For Jenni, a highly ranked player on the national golf American
Junior Golf Assn. circuit before the accident, the game she learned
at age 8 has become a refuge, a focal point to channel her grief.</LD>
<TE>   She sustained cuts and bruises in the accident but was playing in
a tournament three weeks later. Last month, she was runner-up in the
U.S. Girls' Junior Championship, junior golf's premier event. And now
that school has started, she has reclaimed her spot as the top player
(her average is under par) on Southern California's best girls' team.</TE>
<TE>   Observers marvel at her composure, her toughness. But Jenni, 17,
isn't sure about that.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone says I'm doing well, so I guess I'm doing pretty well,"
she said. "But I don't know if I am. People are always like, 'Wow,
you're pretty strong.' Maybe. I've managed to convince myself that
I'm strong and put on a smile."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The night before the accident, the Wilson girls' golf team stayed
in a hotel near the PGA of Southern California Golf Club in Calimesa.
Dianne Sirisut, a teammate, wanted Jenni to stay in her room, but
Jenni chose to remain with her parents. Her father had been released
from the hospital 11 days earlier after suffering a minor stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "Something told me I should stay with them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Jenni shot 69 and Wilson finished second in the
section championship. As her mother drove them away from the course,
they all talked about the round -- how happy they were for Jenni and
how frustrating it was to lose by a stroke -- before Jenni and
Sirisut dozed off in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   About 3:30 p.m., their sports utility vehicle apparently hit the
center divider, swerved across the westbound Pomona Freeway and
tumbled down an embankment, rolling over and landing right-side up on
a street below.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni was trapped by the crushed roof of the car. Sirisut was
conscious, but Jenni wasn't sure about her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't really see my dad," she said. "My mom was resting on
the seat and I thought she moved. I thought she was still alive."</TE>
<TE>   But as rescuers began cutting away at the car to free Jenni and
Sirisut, paramedics placed blankets over the bodies of Jenni's
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni still isn't sure what caused the accident. California
Highway Patrol officers speculated that Uthaivan fell asleep at the
wheel, but they can't be sure. The accident report lists driver error
as the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I want to know is what really happened," Jenni
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first month or so after the accident, just about
everything reminded Jenni of her parents. Now it's little things that
sometimes catch her off guard: A question that her father, a history
buff, would surely be able to answer; a television show she used to
watch with her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Jenni had the braces on her teeth removed -- a special
day for any 17-year-old. But when she returned home from the
orthodontist, her parents weren't there to see her smile.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni said she misses her parents most "when I'm stressed."
Lately, it's the college recruiting process that has her anxious. She
has stacks of letters from colleges, but nothing from the places
she'd like to hear from most.</TE>
<TE>   Talking to her older brother, Tommy, helps. A junior who plays on
the Yale golf team, Tommy was, for years, Jenni's practice partner.
Though now separated by thousands of miles, they are closer than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom always wanted me to call home every night," Tommy said.
"It used to be a hassle, but now I don't think of it like that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Since shortly after the accident, Jenni has lived with the
Panichpakdee family across town from her family home in Long Beach.
Pete Panichpakdee was a childhood friend of Ittisak in Thailand. They
remained close after both immigrated to Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Pete and his wife, Ku, have four children ages 13-20. Two of them
played golf at Wilson, including Ryan, 18, who won the Moore League
boys' title as a senior last spring. Jenni calls Pete and Ku uncle
and aunt.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, renters occupy the house where the
Tangtiphaiboontana family used to live. Jenni and Tommy now own it
and Jenni occasionally drives by, just to have a look.</TE>
<TE>   "I really miss the garden," she said. "We had lots of fruit trees
-- a lime tree, a nectarine tree, an orange tree -- and they were
really good."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Jenni's belongings are in storage, but she kept four
photos of her family for her new room. She drives to Corona del Mar
once a week to visit her parents' ashes.</TE>
<TE>   "She still gets upset sometimes," said Sirisut, who has been close
to Jenni since they were both freshmen at Wilson. "I think she's
grown up a lot inside, but outside she still wants to be her old
self."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Her friends, family and coach talk about how strong and tough
Jenni is, but it's also apparent that she's still fragile and a bit
confused about how she's supposed to handle the rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like, 'OK, I have other stuff I need to do and I
need to move on,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Golf has helped, but even that was difficult at first. Ittisak
taught his daughter to play and Uthaivan rarely missed one of her
matches. Jenni struggled to find her form for a long time and nearly
quit several times because the game made her think of her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "She couldn't get her game back," Tommy said. "She'd get really
upset. She was putting too much pressure on herself. She expected so
much more out of herself because of what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Then came a breakthrough. In June, Jenni shot three consecutive
72s and finished second in an AJGA tournament in Washington. At
another tournament a few weeks later, she fired a 67, the first time
she broke par in competition since the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while it was hard," Jenni said. "I would lose focus and
wouldn't really feel like playing, but that went away. When I got out
there at the beginning of summer, playing competitively, that's when
it started coming back."</TE>
<TE>   She finished 12th and third in her next two AJGA tournaments, won
the consolation championship at the Women's Western Junior, and
capped the summer with her crowning achievement last month at the
U.S. Girls' Junior.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson Coach Jim Ferguson expected Jenni would bounce back strong.
"People were kind of waiting to see if she would be the same golfer
after the accident," he said. "They were waiting to see if she would
fall apart at the seams, but that's not her personality. People who
thought that were people who never met Jenni."</TE>
<TE>   For Jenni, returning to the course was about more than trying to
win tournaments. Golf has been a friend, a comfort, a form of
therapy. She continues to play because it brings her peace. And
because it would make her parents proud.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much every time I play," she said, "I try to play for
them."</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Murray Says Power Play Needs a Return to Basics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings have lost their juice.</LD>
<LD>   After leading the NHL in power-play efficiency last season, they
have converted only three of 31 opportunities in their first five
games, one of 23 since going two for eight in their opener against
the Phoenix Coyotes. Their 9.7% success rate is far off last season's
20.7% pace and ranks among the worst in the league.</LD>
<LD>   One obvious problem, it would seem, is that they've played the
last three games without high-scoring winger Ziggy Palffy, sidelined
because of a strained groin. Without Palffy, they are 0 for 15 with
the man advantage.</LD>
<TE>   "We played six or seven weeks without him last year and we kept
our percentage up there," Coach Andy Murray said Sunday after the
Kings went 0 for 6 in Saturday's 2-2 tie against the Vancouver
Canucks. "He's a good player on the power player, but if he's not
there we've got to get it done with other people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just making it too easy on the penalty killers with our
lack of quick puck movement. We're not retrieving as many loose pucks
as we should when we rim them in. It's not major, but they're all
little things that add up."</TE>
<TE>   No major changes are planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to confuse the issue," Murray said. "There are
basic things you can do on the power play and we have to continually
work at it. I think we want to stay with our concept....</TE>
<TE>   "Normally when you're struggling you go back to basics and that's
[to] play shot and rebound, get pucks to the net, get traffic and
bang one by them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palffy, not expected to sit out any games after he was injured
Oct. 12, is eligible to come off the injured list before Wednesday
night's game at Detroit, but Murray said his status is still
uncertain. "With certain types of injuries, you just don't know,"
Murray said.... Saturday's tie ended the Kings' nine-game winning
streak against opponents that had played at Anaheim the night before
playing the Kings.... Murray, on the Kings' decision to recall Derek
Armstrong from the minors instead of veteran Steve Heinze, who scored
eight of his 15 goals on the power play last season: "We need to
bring up the players who are our best players down there."
Armstrong's goal Saturday was his first in the NHL since the 1997-98
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Bailey, son of the late King scout Ace Bailey, has been hired
by the Kings as a part-time scout. His father, the Kings' director of
pro scouting, was killed last year in the attacks on the World Trade
Center.</TE>

<HD>Samake Might Start Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson played Kobe Bryant to exhaustion on Saturday night, just
as Bryant had hoped, bringing the Lakers into their final week of
preparation for the regular season with a heavy-legged swingman to go
with their absentee center.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant will recover, but the Lakers will open without Shaquille
O'Neal, and perhaps with free agent Soumaila Samake as their starting
center against the San Antonio Spurs on Oct. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson hasn't carried a backup center such as Samake for the last
two seasons, primarily because he hasn't had the option.</LD>
<TE>   This year, General Manager Mitch Kupchak brought in Samake for the
summer league team, signed him again to a make-good contract before
training camp and, now, with David Robinson, Arvydas Sabonis and
possibly Michael Olowokandi coming in the first week alone,
everyone's glad he did.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean Samake will play big minutes early?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't say big minutes," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   But, Samake -- and not Samaki Walker, whom Jackson likes against
smaller centers -- could start in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe. Maybe," Jackson said. "We'll see. This egg isn't cooked.
We've still got three games.... I like his attitude, the way he
plays, his demeanor out there.... I don't know if I'd start him
opening night. Who do we play opening night?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "San Antonio? I'd probably start him opening night," he said.
"And, like I've said, we've got a good chance of being 0-7, the way
we're playing."</TE>
<TE>   If so, that would mean losses to San Antonio, to Portland, to the
Clippers, another to Portland, and then to Cleveland, Boston and
Washington to launch their effort for a fourth consecutive
championship. Perhaps after that, by a Nov. 12 game against Atlanta,
they'd have O'Neal back.</TE>
<TE>   "The first seven games or the last seven, whenever Shaq's not
there, it's going to be flat-out tough," Derek Fisher said.
"Emotionally, we have to register that we need to measure ourselves
by our level of execution, by our intensity and our competitiveness
without him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson has told friends he does not intend to take Howard
Schultz's offer to buy into the Seattle SuperSonics, which would have
forced him to sell his stake in the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   These are fluid negotiations, however, and there is no denying
Johnson's intention to run a team, much as Jerry West has taken
control of the Memphis Grizzlies. Though the situation in Seattle
might not seem a wise business move now, Johnson is almost certain to
continue monitoring management and ownership opportunities in the
NBA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did not practice Sunday. They'll be back in El Segundo
today, then in San Diego on Tuesday night, when they'll play an
exhibition game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Is No Longer a Footnote</HD>
<DH>Ruiz's overtime goal defeats New England, 1-0, as L.A. ends
string of near misses to win first MLS title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FOXBORO, Mass. -- What's a mere 113 minutes after seven seasons of
waiting, anyway?</LD>
<LD>   Membership in the MLS champions club wasn't going to come easily
for the long-suffering Galaxy, which previously fell short three
times at the final hurdle. It took a one-timed, left-footed goal from
Guatemalan striker Carlos Ruiz in overtime, in the 113th minute, to
complete the Galaxy's journey, giving it a 1-0 victory over the New
England Revolution in the MLS Cup at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   And so, the circle was completed before a record MLS Cup crowd of
61,316. As Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas said the other day, some
circles are a lot bigger than others. Two of the Galaxy's three
losses in finals were in this city, the first being Oct. 20, 1996, in
the old Patriots' stadium. Galaxy midfielders Cobi Jones and Mauricio
Cienfuegos were there, and maybe that's why the two were visibly
moved in the post-match celebration after the most important victory
in franchise history. Jones clutched the trophy and looked as if he
was never going to let it slip from his hands. Of the MLS' seven
finals, he has played in four. "Seven [seasons] of waiting for it,"
he said, beaming. Cienfuegos stood in the dressing room with his
8-year-old son and said: "I was trying to get that Cup for seven
years."</LD>
<TE>   Validation had Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid spinning into motion. Just
after Ruiz's goal from the penalty area beat sprawling Revolution
goalkeeper Adin Brown on the far side, just inside the right post,
Schmid raced onto the field, arms thrust in the air, and joined the
pile of players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've sprinted so fast in my life," Schmid said. "I
said, 'Should I stop or should I keep going?' I said, 'I'll keep
going.' For me, the emotional moment, when I finally got to Carlos,
at the bottom of the pile. We finally got the chance to embrace. He
just started crying and I started crying."</TE>
<TE>   In the interview room, Schmid paid tribute to Revolution General
Manager Todd Smith, who has cancer and has decided to step down.
Schmid mentioned his mother, who died from the disease, and started
to cry in talking about his 72-year-old aunt, Annaliese Kavoian of
Huntington Beach, a big supporter of Galaxy midfielder Ezra
Hendrickson.</TE>
<TE>   "She used to say to me, 'Why do you play this crazy sport? This
sport is stupid.' She used to get [upset] because I'd be late for
family functions because I'd be playing in a soccer game or
coaching," Schmid said. "At the age of 70, she started following the
L.A. Galaxy and soccer. She hasn't missed a home game in two years,
and she flew out here to watch this one.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows this sport can catch anybody at any age.... Her being
here today, for me, was very special. It's as close as it could be to
my mom being here."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy nearly went home without the title for the fourth time.
It was a taut defensive struggle that appeared to be headed to
penalty kicks. About a minute before Ruiz's game-winner, New
England's Winston Griffiths hit the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy countered quickly for the game-winner. Galaxy forward
Chris Albright said he intended to play the ball to Ruiz but heard
defender Tyrone Marshall, who was pushing up on the right flank,
calling out.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard this guy screaming my name," said Albright, who came into
the game in the 67th minute to replace Alejandro Moreno. "I just laid
a nice ball into space. I thought [Marshall] was going to shoot it,
and he played a great first-time ball over to Fish [Ruiz]. It was
definitely a better decision because Carlos was in a better spot."</TE>
<TE>   Said Marshall, who was stellar in the back with Danny Califf and
Lalas: "I knew it was open for Fish. I let him do the thing. I've
been taking shots in the first half, the second half, and they've
been going wide and high. I'm a defender. Let him finish. He's the
man. He's MVP."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hendrickson: "This one was a difficult one, more difficult
than some of the ones he missed earlier. It was coming waist, chest
high and he hit it one-time. He's a finisher. That's what he does. No
better time to score a golden goal and give us a championship. That's
what great finishers do. You give him an inch, a yard, and they make
you look silly."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who scored a league-high 24 goals during the regular season,
had two other chances to win it in overtime, including a bicycle kick
in the 12th minute of overtime. The shot bounced on the ground in
front of Brown and deflected off the keeper's face.</TE>
<TE>   The confident Ruiz, the league's most valuable player, seemed to
have a sense it would come down to him, having predicted victory a
couple of days ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Being champion outside my country is a great feeling," said Ruiz,
who scored eight goals in the playoffs and was the game's MVP. "This
is very important to me and Guatemalan soccer. It's proof all the
talents are there."</TE>
<TE>   The defensive effort from both sides could not be underestimated
on a tricky windy day. Galaxy players said the condition of the pitch
was lousy, which said even more about Califf's job on star striker
Taylor Twellman, who was held to two shots.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wonderful game, and the crowd was great," Lalas said.
"The field was [bad]. The wind was whipping around. This is not going
to be packaged up as the beautiful game. But there's a lot of people
in Los Angeles that could care less, and a lot of people in this
locker room too."</TE>

<HD>Yao Reports to Rockets</HD>

<AU>From Associated Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, Yao Ming has joined the Houston Rockets.</LD>
<LD>   Yao, the NBA's overall No. 1 draft pick, landed in Houston on
Sunday in time to see his new team play the Orlando Magic in an
exhibition game at Compaq Center.</LD>
<LD>   His arrival came after months of contract negotiations, releases
from the Chinese government and a pledge of allegiance to the Chinese
national team.</LD>
<TE>   Yao, who led the Chinese national team to a silver medal in the
recent Asian Games, signed an agreement to return home for future
international competition. His four-year contract with the Rockets is
worth $17.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot-5 center will begin workouts with the Rockets to try to
get ready for the Nov. 1 season opener at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets' next exhibition game is Wednesday at San Antonio. His
first chance to play before the home crowd would be Thursday against
the Philadelphia 76ers--if Coach Rudy Tomjanovich decides to play
him.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, who averaged 32.4 points and 18.9 rebounds with his club team
in Shanghai last season, is the first foreign player who didn't play
college basketball in the United States to be chosen as the NBA's No.
1 draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Nate Huffman of the Toronto Raptors will undergo
arthroscopic surgery today on his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot-1 rookie is expected to be sidelined from four to six
weeks. He sat out the last two exhibition games because of swelling
in the knee.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman, 27, signed with Toronto after averaging 18.8 points and
7.5 rebounds for Israeli League champion Maccabi Elite Tel-Aviv last
season.</TE>

<HD>Burns Holds Off Woods and Wins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Burns became the 16th player to win his first PGA Tour event this
year at the Disney World Golf Classic Sunday at Lake Buena Vista,
Fla., but he distinguished himself in one other significant way.</LD>
<LD>   None of the other first-time winners had to fight off a challenge
from Tiger Woods.</LD>
<LD>   Burns made consecutive birdies on the back nine to take control
and was solid the rest of the way, closing with a seven-under-par 65
for a one-stroke victory over Chris DiMarco.</LD>
<TE>   Woods made up a six-stroke deficit over 10 holes and finished with
a 63. He missed a six-foot birdie putt on the final hole that ended
his chances. He finished third, two strokes behind.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time in three years at the Disney Classic that
Woods has finished at 23-under 265 and had only a third-place finish
to show for it.</TE>
<TE>   Burns came to Disney World with hopes of having a good enough week
to finish in the top 125 on the money list and keep his card. He was
118th, but that's no longer a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, who finished with a 25-under 263, earned $666,000 and now
has a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dana Quigley shot a two-under-par 69 and held off a final-round
charge by Bob Gilder to win the Senior PGA Tour's SBC Championship by
one stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's 12-under-par 201 total at San Antonio was worth
$217,500. It was his second win this year and his seventh on the
Senior PGA Tour. He won the Siebel Classic in San Jose in March.</TE>
<TE>   Vicente Fernandez (70) was third at 10-under 203. Tom Watson (70)
finished another two strokes back and Gil Morgan (71) was at 206.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els won his fourth World Match Play title with a 2 and 1
victory over Sergio Garcia at Virginia Water, England. Els earned
$390,000 for the victory. Garcia got $187,000.</TE>
<TE>   It was Els' first win in the event since 1996 when he became the
only player to win it three years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Busch beat the field out of the pits with 91 laps to go and
then held off Johnny Benson to win the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Old
Dominion 500 at Martinsville, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, who started 36th, took the lead for the first time on the
389th of 500 laps after a 15.3-second pit stop and lost it for only
one lap the rest of the way. He ran the last 10 laps with Benson
trying for his first win in 224 career starts.</TE>
<TE>   Busch beat Benson by 0.46 seconds for his second career victory,
both this season. It was the seventh win for the Roush Racing Fords.</TE>
<TE>   Point leader Tony Stewart's margin over Jimmie Johnson closed from
97 to 82 points. Mark Martin remained third and is 123 behind with
four races left.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who started 31st, finished 11th. Johnson was sixth and
Martin 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Wimmer held off Ron Hornaday on a restart with seven laps
left and won the rain-delayed Busch Series Sam's Town 250 at Memphis
Motorsports Park for his second victory in four races.</TE>
<TE>   Wimmer led 83 of the 250 laps and passed Hornaday for the final
time on the 218th lap. He averaged 79.337 mph in his Pontiac on the
three-quarter-mile oval and had to avoid three cautions in the final
30 laps for his second career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Compton was second, followed by Jamie McMurray, who needed a
provisional and started 37th after becoming the quickest Winston Cup
winner in the modern era last week at Charlotte, N.C., in only his
second start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first California Late Model championship finished in a tie
between Ron Daniel and Mike Price, even though Brian Kelley won the
race at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel finished second and Price fourth in the Victory Circle
100-lap race. In the first half of the two-race series, held at
Irwindale Speedway on Oct. 12, Price finished third and Daniel fifth.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, track officials from both facilities decided that
Daniel, who had a higher overall combined finish than Price, was
awarded the $1,000 bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi claimed his record 15th Masters Series title when
Jiri Novak withdrew from the final of the $2.5-million Madrid final
because of a groin injury. The win moved Agassi within 43 points of
No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in the ATP Champions Race. Novak suffered the
injury Saturday during his semifinal victory against Fabrice
Santoro.... Lindsay Davenport lost to Patty Schnyder in the final of
the $1.2-million Swisscom Challenge at Zurich. Schnyder needed 2
hours 15 minutes to prevail, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (8), 6-3, and win her first
title of 2002.</TE>

<HD>Brees Keeps His Cool With the Heat On</HD>
<DH>He completes key pass in overtime to set up winning run by
Tomlinson as Chargers beat Raiders, 27-21.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OAKLAND -- Marty Schottenheimer has proclaimed it for weeks. But it's
one thing to talk the talk, quite another to call the call.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the San Diego Charger coach showed the world -- or at
least the AFC West world that matters most to his team -- that Drew
Brees is his man.</LD>
<LD>   On third and 10 from the Oakland Raider 30-yard line in overtime,
Schottenheimer called a pass play from shotgun formation.</LD>
<TE>   Even though the Raiders had been putting on a fierce rush and a
sack would have taken the Chargers out of field-goal range.</TE>
<TE>   Even though tailback LaDainian Tomlinson was the safe choice and
had already touched the ball 43 times.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Brees, 23, is in his first season as the Charger
starting quarterback and Schottenheimer has a streak of conservatism
as thick as his spine.</TE>
<TE>   Brees took the snap and completed a sharp 11-yard pass to Tim
Dwight. The discouraged Raiders didn't regroup quickly enough and
Tomlinson blasted 19 yards for a touchdown on the next play, giving
the Chargers a 27-21 victory at Network Associates Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I trust the quarterback," Schottenheimer said. "He knew what to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Enraged Raider fans pelted Tomlinson with plastic bottles and
paper cups while Brees and the rest of the offense swarmed him in
jubilation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking we were going to win the whole time," said Brees,
a second-year quarterback from Purdue who beat out Doug Flutie for
the starting job before the season.</TE>
<TE>   "In the fourth quarter, I was saying, 'Now, now, now.' I said in
the huddle, 'Let's keep pounding them.' They were at home and it
wasn't easy, but I didn't think we were going to lose the game."</TE>
<TE>   No way the Raiders thought they would lose, either, not with
All-Pro Charger linebacker Junior Seau and starting defensive end
Marcellus Wiley sidelined because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   And not with first place in the division on the line. The Chargers
(6-1) have a one-game lead over Denver and are 1 1/2 games ahead of
the Raiders (4-2), who had won the previous four meetings. San Diego
is off to its best start since its 1994 Super Bowl year and can enjoy
a bye next week, letting the injuries heal.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders have lost two in a row and must dwell on their almost
nonexistent running attack, a run defense that isn't as good as
advertised and serious injuries to rookie cornerback Phillip Buchanon
(left wrist) and reserve running back Terry Kirby (broken leg). Both
players had surgery Sunday and are out indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Plus there are new questions about kicker Sebastian Janikowski,
who missed two field-goal attempts, and old ones about
self-destructive penalties at the worst possible times.</TE>
<TE>   Janikowski hit the right upright from 27 yards in the first
quarter and was wide left from 48 yards with 11:44 to play in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Bill Romanowski was flagged for a personal foul for
trying to use Tomlinson as a floor mop after the whistle with 10
minutes left in the fourth quarter. The penalty extended a drive that
ended in a Brees' plunge for a touchdown and a 21-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Raiders had a season-low 50 penalty yards, they are
on pace to break the NFL record of 1,304.</TE>
<TE>   They are also on pace to set the league scoring record, but were
shut out in the first half by a Charger defense led by linebackers
Donnie Edwards and Ben Leber. End Adrian Dingle had 1 1/2 sacks in
relief of Wiley.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland gathered steam as the second half progressed behind
quarterback Rich Gannon, who completed 35 of 45 passes for 361 yards
and three touchdowns. He connected on eight of nine during an 82-yard
drive and hit fullback Jon Ritchie in the flat for a seven-yard
touchdown that tied the score with 1:21 to play in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Two Raider scoring drives in the third quarter also came almost
exclusively through the air. The only run during a 68-yard drive that
cut San Diego's lead to 14-7 was a seven-yard scramble by Gannon and
the only run during a 93-yard drive that ended with a touchdown on
the first play of the fourth quarter was a two-yard loss by Charlie
Garner.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders finished with 37 yards rushing in 12 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "We elected to keep it open and spread them out so Rich could see
what the defense was letting open," Coach Bill Callahan said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chargers won the toss in overtime and Gannon never saw the
ball again. Tomlinson's touchdown gave him 153 yards in 39 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The second-year running back was dropped for losses on 10 carries
and his longest was only 19 yards, but his relentless banging inside
the tackles and occasional bursts around end wore down the Raiders,
whose defense is ranked No. 2 in the NFL against the run.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Tomlinson was the last man standing.</TE>
<TE>   And Brees is Schottenheimer's man -- despite the coach not yet
referring to him as such.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid plays with a lot of poise," he said. "He has more
composure than myself and the other coaches. He's demonstrated that
enough over the last six weeks that I know it's real."</TE>

<LD>Somewhere on the Mediterranean island of Corsica this morning, Greg
Vanney will be smiling. Perhaps he will even put in a call to Paul
Caligiuri.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere near Acapulco, Mexico, this afternoon, Jorge Campos will
grin for no apparent reason. Perhaps he will even send Cobi Jones an
e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere in Denver today, Robin Fraser will nod knowingly to
himself and, not for the first time, will mumble "finally." Perhaps
he will even call Dan Calichman.</LD>
<TE>   In places around the globe, wherever Galaxy players of the past
find themselves, they will hold their heads a little higher, look
strangers in the eye a little more directly and know that justice, at
long last, has been done.</TE>
<TE>   Especially those players who played for the Los Angeles teams of
1996, 1999 and 2001, the teams that reached Major League Soccer's
championship game only to be tripped at the final hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly men are nearly men no more. The Galaxy is MLS champion.</TE>
<TE>   The moment Carlos Ruiz's angled shot slipped beneath the legs of
diving New England Revolution goalkeeper Adin Brown Sunday afternoon
at Foxboro, Mass., the albatross that had hung around the Galaxy
team's neck since its rain-soaked loss to D.C. United at Foxboro
Stadium six years ago, suddenly took wing and vanished.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointments of past seasons, of two title-game losses to
D.C. United and one to the San Jose Earthquakes, are merely memories
now. Unpleasant, true, but no longer a burden.</TE>
<TE>   So if Eduardo "El Tanque" Hurtado looks a little happier today in
his native Ecuador, there is good reason. If Carlos Hermosillo and
Luis Hernandez appear in a brighter mood than usual in their native
Mexico, it means the news has reached them.</TE>
<TE>   If Martin Machon, the Galaxy's first Guatemalan standout, is
celebrating fellow countryman Ruiz's achievement, the chances are
that Clint Mathis and Chris Armas are too, along with Danny Pena,
Welton, Jorge Salcedo, Harut Karapetyan, Roy Myers and the dozens of
other former Galaxy players.</TE>
<TE>   Championships are not won merely by the players on the field.
Those on the sideline contribute as well. So, too, do those who over
the years provided the foundation on which today's trophy rests.</TE>
<TE>   Teams change from one season to another. Players and coaches come
and go. But all contribute a piece or two to the puzzle until the
picture finally emerges.</TE>
<TE>   When Ruiz's goal -- his 32nd in 32 games in his inaugural MLS
season -- slipped into the net to end 113 minutes of high drama, only
one player, Jones, was on the field who had been there on April 13,
1996, when the Galaxy made its debut in front of 69,255 at the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   When Cobi has a chance to show Galaxy fans the Alan I. Rothenberg
trophy next season, it will not be at the Rose Bowl but at the team's
new home, its sparkling 27,000-seat stadium that rapidly is taking
shape in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   The league could not have scripted it better than to have its
flagship team -- sorry, D.C. United -- open its season as champion in
what will be the league's finest soccer-only stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that winning the title qualifies the Galaxy for the
CONCACAF Champions Cup, and that that tournament, in turn, can unlock
the door to the World Club Championship, should FIFA revive that
event, is merely tomorrow's icing on today's cake.</TE>
<TE>   But for a long while Sunday -- for the entire game, in fact --
everything hung in the balance, and the strain was visible on the
face of Coach Sigi Schmid.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, his predecessors, Lothar Osiander and Octavio Zambrano,
were watching and were similarly stressed. After all, they helped
build this championship team.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid hates to lose, absolutely loathes it, so the poor man was
in agony throughout a tense game that was always likely to be settled
by a single goal. One miscue would be all it would take for the
Galaxy to stumble yet again.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Hartman was largely untroubled in the Galaxy nets, thanks to
the near-flawless play of defenders Alexi Lalas, Tyrone Marshall and
Danny Califf.</TE>
<TE>   In the five-man midfield, the last members of the original Galaxy
team, Jones and Mauricio Cienfuegos, kept things flowing, along with
Ezra Hendrickson, Simon Elliott and Sasha Victorine. Up front,
Alejandro Moreno reduced the pressure on Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour, Schmid sent Peter Vagenas into the game in place of
Cienfuegos, and later introduced Chris Albright in place of Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the names that will be recorded among the statistics.</TE>
<TE>   But fans who have followed the team for seven seasons know that
those players alone are not responsible for this triumph.</TE>
<TE>   It was the past that led to the present. Just as the present will
lead to the future.</TE>

<LD>Ecuadoreans headed for a cliffhanger presidential election with a
former coup leader and a banana tycoon poised to enter a second-round
runoff Nov. 24, according to election results.</LD>
<LD>   With 72% of polling stations counted, retired army Col. Lucio
Gutierrez had 18.79% of the vote, according to results provided by
the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. In 2000, Gutierrez joined an Indian
uprising that toppled the president and installed then-Vice President
Gustavo Noboa as leader. On Gutierrez's heels was Ecuador's richest
man, Alvaro Noboa -- no relation to Gustavo -- with 17.65% of the
vote. Socialist lawmaker Leon Roldos was third with 15.98%.</LD>

<HD>An Iraqi Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Day</HD>
<DH>Bent on solidifying his base of support, Saddam Hussein
grants amnesty to tens of thousands of political prisoners and common
criminals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ABU GHRAIB PRISON, Iraq</DL>
<LD>President Saddam Hussein opened the doors of his nation's prisons
Sunday, freeing tens of thousands of murderers and draft dodgers,
political prisoners and petty thieves in a dramatic act of national
reconciliation.</LD>
<LD>   The sweeping amnesty was extended to offenders who fled the
country, including political opposition figures in London and
military deserters living in the region of northern Iraq outside
Baghdad's control. Spies for the United States and the "Zionist
entity," Israel, would remain behind bars, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The president's announcement at midday came as a shock to the
inmates crowded into facilities all over the country, including
political detainees such as Faiq Abdul Rahman, a 44-year-old Kurd who
had been in prison for 13 years on a charge of espionage.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so desperate that I had prepared to spend the rest of my
life in prison," Abdul Rahman said a few hours after his release. He
had expected to serve every last day of a 20-year sentence -- until
he flipped on a television set Sunday and heard the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not expecting to be free. I am shocked," he said. "I got
outside and I could not even walk."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahman had been held in Abu Ghraib, the nation's largest and
most notorious prison, a place where human rights groups say there
have been regular summary executions -- and for the living,
deplorable conditions.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the prison about 20 miles from Baghdad became the scene
of a chaotic party, a near-riot, in fact, as thousands of family
members rushed to see their loved ones walk free. Some people fired
automatic weapons in celebration. Others sang songs, banged drums or
just stood hunched over, sobbing in disbelief and joy.</TE>
<TE>   Guards tried to keep the growing crowd behind wrought-iron gates
and concrete walls, but they could not withstand the numbers. Soon
there were people scaling the walls, pulling themselves over barbed
wire, standing on the guard towers.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, they found a sprawling campus of dirt, cells and murals of
Hussein. An overwhelming stench came from the area where political
prisoners were held, probably from sewage and garbage.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowds rushed in, prisoners tried to push their way out,
some dragging along metal boxes, their bedrolls and other meager
possessions. Occasionally, someone would stop, there would be a
moment of recognition, then hugging and crying.</TE>
<TE>   Thayer Muhawish, 26, was sentenced to 135 years in prison for a
robbery. He served one year and was headed home Sunday to see his
daughter for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our president would not let me die like this," he said as he
stared almost blankly at the massive crowd around him.</TE>
<TE>   Malik Aboud, 35, was bound for home after serving half of an
eight-year sentence for forging government payroll documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our president is very generous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That may be, but Hussein also appears to be looking out for
himself. At home, the president is as powerful as he has been since
crushing rebellions after the Persian Gulf War in 1991. But he is
also well aware of his government's vulnerabilities, among them the
restive Kurds living in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south
who rebelled against the nation's Sunni leadership a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Amid fears that the United States will exploit those fissures and
try to topple his government, Hussein has been looking to solidify
his base of support. He has given weapons, money and supplies to
tribes, met with religious leaders, doubled food rations for the
public -- and now emptied the nation's prisons.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a threat of war," said A.K. Hashimi, a presidential
advisor. "It's a good idea to give every Iraqi the chance to decide
for himself if he wants to fight."</TE>
<TE>   There was no way to know precisely how many prisoners walked free
Sunday, or whether Iraqis who have fled the country would accept
their pardons and come home. In the past, some returnees have been
executed.</TE>
<TE>   But it is telling about this nation -- and how it views its own
laws -- that its leader could win widespread support by opening up
its prisons. Many people praised Hussein for designing the decree to
be comprehensive and apply to political prisoners and young draft
evaders as well as common criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the government said that murderers would be released
only if "the families of the victims would forgive them." But one of
the first men to leave the compound here said he had killed a man and
been sentenced to life behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect President Saddam Hussein will do good things for us,"
he said. "He will stand against Americans and the Zionists."</TE>
<TE>   Some pockets of society questioned the wisdom of the prisoner
release. Wamidh Nadhmi, a professor of political science at Baghdad
University, said he had hoped for a broader endorsement of democracy
and freedom of speech and for an overture to the rebel Kurds in the
north. Such gestures would strengthen the regime, Nadhmi said.</TE>
<TE>   But "the official line is this is not the time to talk about
democracy," he added. "Democracy is desired among Iraqis. But this is
supposed to be a time of steel-like unity, a time for the leader to
lead the country."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign convicts, including Jordanians and Kuwaitis, were expected
to be released today. Iraq says it does not hold any Kuwaiti POWs
from 1991 -- a contention Kuwait disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The amnesty extended to "all Arabs, without exception, except
those that committed espionage for the Zionist entity and America,"
said Abdul Hussein Shendal Esa, one of Iraq's top judges, who came
here Sunday to witness the release.</TE>
<TE>   The amnesty was announced five days after a referendum on
Hussein's presidency, which officials said garnered the support of
100% of Iraqi voters. A similar referendum in 1995 was also followed
by an amnesty decree.</TE>
<TE>   But this is the first amnesty to cover political prisoners like
Abdul Rahman. He said Sunday that prison life was not too terrible.
He even managed to start a small business, grilling meat kebabs for
other inmates. Eventually, he was able to rent his stand to a fellow
convict and save enough money to buy a remote-controlled television.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he had just started eating a piece of grilled chicken
when he heard the news on the television and "the food was stuck in
my throat because I was happy. This is impossible. I couldn't even
imagine or dream about it."</TE>
<TE>   An hour and a half later, he said, the person in charge of the
political prisoners shouted: "Come on! All the doors, all the gates
are open!"</TE>

<HD>Irish Voters Say Yes to Larger EU</HD>
<DH>National campaign brings out supporters of expansion after
earlier referendum rejected it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Appealing to Irish generosity and unleashing the muscle of machine
politics, Ireland's government won a convincing referendum victory
Sunday, securing the necessary permission to reach behind the old
Iron Curtain and welcome more countries into the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Just under 63% of those who voted gave an approving "yes" to the
constitutional arcana of the Treaty of Nice, named after the French
city where the blueprint for EU enlargement from 15 to 25 countries
was crafted two years ago. The aspirant members range from relative
powerhouse economies Poland and the Czech Republic to tiny Latvia in
the Baltics. Mediterranean countries such as Malta and Cyprus would
also be allowed to join.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very important vote for Ireland, for Europe, but mainly
for the applicant countries," said Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern,
who was deeply embarrassed when Ireland vetoed the expansion plans in
a lightly attended referendum 16 months ago. This approving vote
reflected an Irish willingness "to welcome the people of the
applicant countries into the union with open hearts," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Ireland is the last EU member to endorse the Nice treaty and the
only one whose constitution required a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   Ahern said the campaign was won by pleas to an Irish population
that has gained socially and economically from its own EU membership
to give less fortunate countries the same chance. Subsidies that
flowed to Ireland after it joined 29 years ago are regarded as partly
responsible for a long economic boom that lasted until recently.</TE>
<TE>   Having been widely accused of running a cavalier campaign the
first time around, Ahern threw his government's resources into
winning this one.</TE>
<TE>   The "yes" campaign was supported by virtually the entire Irish
establishment, from trade unions to multinational corporations and
all main opposition parties, with worried European leaders making
guest appearances to warn against derailing their enlargement
project.</TE>
<TE>   Ahern also found a way to neutralize the "no" side's best issue
before the campaign even began. In the previous vote, rejectionists
struck a chord by arguing that Ireland's revered principle of
military neutrality was threatened by plans to create an EU
rapid-reaction force, which could drag the country into an unwanted
mutual defense pact.</TE>
<TE>   But shortly after his government won reelection in May, Ahern
convinced his European partners to issue a declaration making it
clear the Irish would not be bound by any common defense treaty
unless they expressed their willingness to do so in another
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The move defanged the "no" side's sharpest argument against the
treaty. And the treaty's opponents, who had never been hostile toward
the principle of expansion, found it hard to articulate their
concerns about the accord's fine print, including how jurisdiction
over issues such as trade, justice and environmental regulation would
shift from national governments to the EU.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahern kept appealing to that traditional Irish conceit of being
'generous,' and the 'no' campaign was left with only those grumblers
who say no to everything," said Michael Barry, a Dublin software
designer.</TE>
<TE>   The number of "no" votes was almost the same as in the first
referendum, in June 2001. But the higher turnout -- almost half of
the 2.9 million eligible voters made it to the polls -- worked in the
"yes" side's favor.</TE>
<TE>   The result was welcomed by governments of the 10 aspirant

<HD>South Koreans Blase About Threat</HD>
<DH>Used to taunts from the North, some people in Seoul worry
more about American overreaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The shocking admission by North Korea this month that it has a
nuclear weapons program "and more" has fueled fears among Americans
and added to a sense of global crisis as bad news piles in from Bali,
Iraq, Kuwait, the Philippines, even suburban Washington.</LD>
<LD>   For many South Koreans, however, the apparent confirmation that
their neighbor to the north is busy enriching uranium for use in
bombs and missiles is, well, a bit ho-hum.</LD>
<LD>   "The moment I heard it, I immediately forgot about it," said Kim
Heung Jin, a 24-year-old medical student. "I just don't think it's
such a big deal."</LD>
<TE>   Some South Koreans even say Americans are looking a bit hysterical
over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the U.S. has certainly overreacted," said computer
programmer Chung Jae Hee, 32. "I'm not saying there isn't some
justification, but there seems to be a lack of perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Chung Jae Eun, a 22-year-old nutrition student, said her only
worry is that the U.S. might go too far -- and, in the process,
provoke North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   A major reason people are taking the current scare in stride,
South Koreans say, is a collective numbing of the senses. Over the
years, they say, they've witnessed so many offenses, threats and
taunts by the North that such moves have become almost predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Medical student Kim said he can remember various events in his
life by the North-South crises that coincided with them. And no
matter how bad they seemed, those crises eventually blew over. Even
though this one has the word "nuclear" attached to it, it too will
pass, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, any increase in tension on the peninsula is unwelcome.
Koreans who lived through the Korean War also tend to take the
North's threats more seriously. Most South Koreans alive nowadays
grew up in a period of relative peace and prosperity, however, and
see less threat behind actions by the government in Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us in the postwar generation don't believe there's much
danger," said Lee Sang Yeop, a 28-year-old shipping industry
employee. "It's like that story of the shepherd that keeps calling
'Wolf' all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Even older Koreans like Lee Yo Soon, 61, who acknowledged finding
the news very disconcerting, say worrying too much won't accomplish
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you do?" the food vendor said, adjusting a piece of
dried squid over a small brazier. "You can't live forever."</TE>
<TE>   Shin Yee Jin, a psychiatrist at Yonsei University College of
Medicine who counsels South Koreans and North Korean defectors, said
Koreans on both sides of the demilitarized zone share certain
characteristics born of a common history.</TE>
<TE>   "Koreans can be very expressive and volatile. In fact, foreigners
sometimes think we're really rude," she said. "But, in fact, it's
rarely manifest as violence.... In the end, people become
desensitized."</TE>
<TE>   Of far greater concern for them these days, said several South
Koreans, are the more mundane issues of keeping a job, finding a
spouse, moving out of their parents' house or choosing a good
president in December. Sometimes it seems as if the farther away
people are, the more worried they become about events on the Korean
peninsula, said homemaker Kim Ok Lee, 47.</TE>
<TE>   "My relatives just called about this nuclear business from
Germany, all worried. I told them I don't give a darn. Here it's life
as usual," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some say they believe North Korea was bluffing when it reportedly
touted its weapons program. Others say Pyongyang probably has a bomb
or two.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought they probably did anyway," said Park Ji Hyun, a
24-year-old language student. "So there's no great shock. I think
both sides believe we'll be unified someday, so I can't see them ever
bombing us."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Meets Resistance in Removal of Settlers</HD>
<DH>Melee erupts during eviction. Conservatives criticize
government over the timing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a melee of flying fists and shouted abuse, Israeli soldiers and
police dragged recalcitrant Jewish settlers off a West Bank hilltop
Sunday, demolishing metal shacks the settlers had set up in an
attempt to lay claim to a rocky, remote patch of land outside the
Palestinian city of Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   The confrontation set off bitter recriminations within the
government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with the defense minister,
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, coming under fire from conservative and
religious elements in the governing coalition over the method and
timing of the eviction.</LD>
<LD>   Israelis across the political spectrum were troubled by the
spectacle -- seen in TV footage that led national newscasts, and was
aired over and over again -- of soldiers and settlers coming to
blows, Jew pitted against Jew. For many, that was a vision fraught
with painful overtones, coming during the season when Israelis
commemorate the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew.</LD>
<TE>   Trouble had been brewing for days at the dusty hill known as Havat
Gilad, or Gilad Farm, one of more than a dozen settler outposts
branded illegal by the government. The army has been moving to
dismantle these uninhabited offshoots of larger settlements, which
sometimes consist of little more than a rusting trailer or two, but
troops encountered significant resistance at Havat Gilad, which was
set up in memory of a settler who was slain in May.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers and settlers had skirmished intermittently last week, but
the standoff came to a head Saturday night when troops moved in just
after the Jewish Sabbath ended, setting off a fracas in which about
two dozen people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, some observant Jews in Sharon's government denounced
military leaders for having violated religious law by mobilizing
their troops before the Sabbath had drawn to a close.</TE>
<TE>   Army operations considered necessary to save lives are exempt from
Sabbath rules that prohibit the use of motor vehicles and machinery,
among other things, but conservative critics said evicting the
settlers was clearly not a matter of life-and-death urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's conservative infrastructure minister, Effi Eitam, heaped
scorn on Ben-Eliezer, the defense minister, whom he blamed for the
timing of the troops' deployment.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he so stupid that he doesn't understand an operation starting
on Saturday night and involving masses of soldiers will lead to mass
desecration of the Sabbath?" Eitam said.</TE>
<TE>   When soldiers and police returned Sunday to demolish remaining
metal shack-like structures, about 1,000 settlers and their
supporters staged a furious show of resistance, setting fire to dry
scrubby brush, hurling paint at military vehicles, blocking
bulldozers with their bodies, and screaming pleas and insults at the
Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the PLO army!" some of the protesters shouted. A female
settler, in long skirt and head covering, sobbed as she beseeched the
soldiers to desist. Choking clouds of dust rose into the air as men
scuffled and wrestled on the barren hillside.</TE>
<TE>   One soldier who was wearing a yarmulke was set upon by members of
the crowd who tore at his epaulets and yelled at him, "Take off your
kippa!" Women and girl settlers taunted female troops, shouting, "I
hope your mother sees you on TV and is proud of you!"</TE>
<TE>   At the catcalls, tears sprang to the eyes of some of the young
female soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Troops destroyed the outpost's remaining metal shacks and
withdrew, but a milling crowd of several hundred angry settlers and
supporters had returned to the site by late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For many here, the Havat Gilad confrontation was a reminder of the
divide between religious and secular Israelis -- a long-standing
social chasm that has receded somewhat from the public consciousness
during the last two years of bloody conflict with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Before the intifada began, public opinion polls routinely showed
that many Israelis considered the religious-secular clash to be as
great a threat to the state as the conflict with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon apologized for the violation of the Sabbath, but in a rare
rebuke to the settlers, warned extremists against taking on the
police and the Israel Defense Forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Any attack on the IDF, the security forces or the police is an
attack on the rule of law, and should be firmly condemned and
prohibited," the prime minister was quoted by Israeli media as
telling his Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Because military service is mandatory in Israel, virtually
everyone has a son, a sister or another relative who has served or is
serving in the ranks, and ordinary soldiers enjoy an extremely high
degree of public support, even when military policymaking is called
into question.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer was more blunt in his criticism of the outpost's
defenders, saying they were engaged in an "insurrection."</TE>
<TE>   "We, as citizens of this country, shouldn't forget for even one
second that soldiers defend them day and night, on the Sabbath and on
holidays," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Tries to Block N. Korea's Cash, Sunshine</HD>
<DH>Efforts to pressure the regime to give up its nuclear arms
program focus on enlisting neighbors to cut off aid and goodwill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration hopes to persuade Asian allies to deprive
North Korea of hard currency, other economic assistance and
international goodwill until it agrees to end the production of
nuclear weapons and submit to arms inspections, U.S. officials and
analysts said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   A temporary halt in the construction of two light-water nuclear
reactors in North Korea, being built under a 1994 agreement with the
United States, is also under consideration, the Japanese media
reported Sunday. U.S. officials could not be reached to confirm that
report.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush will try to ratchet up pressure on North Korea this
week during a meeting at his Texas ranch with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and in Mexico, at the annual summit of 21 Asian and Pacific
powers.</LD>
<TE>   The goal is a unified diplomatic strategy that will avoid a
military showdown with heavily armed North Korea, as threatened to
happen in 1994. The administration is hoping to get North Korea's
neighbors, aid donors and political interlocutors to jointly warn of
the potential dangers if it continues to develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now looking at what should be the consequences of their
actions, and we will act step by step after we have had a chance to
fully consult with our friends and allies. And we have an opportunity
to do that this coming week at the APEC meetings in Mexico,"
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Sunday. APEC is the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which, since its founding in
1989, has increasingly also become a major political grouping.</TE>
<TE>   Powell and other senior administration officials blitzed the
Sunday morning television talk shows in an effort to explain why the
U.S. is emphasizing diplomacy in its approach to North Korea's
admitted rogue weapons program even as it gears up for possible war
with Iraq over that nation's alleged pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But with an eye on the coming push in the United Nations for a
tough resolution on Iraq, Powell also stepped back from the
administration's public insistence that the ultimate goal is to
replace Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   "The principal offense here is weapons of mass destruction, and
that's what this [U.N.] resolution is working on," Powell said in an
interview on NBC television. "The major issue before us is
disarmament."</TE>
<TE>   Even as Powell acknowledged that North Korea had nullified the
arms pact that ended the 1994 crisis, he stressed in several Sunday
morning television appearances that the administration wants a
diplomatic solution.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no military plans on the table right now for such an
invasion of North Korea," Powell said. Iraq and North Korea, he said,
are not "identical situations. They're quite different." North Korea
is "a broken economy without access to resources the way Saddam
Hussein has access to resources. We have different levers we can use
with North Korea, quite different than the levers available to us
with respect to Iraq," Powell said in the NBC interview.</TE>
<TE>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice echoed those comments
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to have cookie-cutter foreign policy where we try
to apply the same formula to every case. It would be foolhardy to do
that," Rice said on CNN's "Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also revealed that the U.S. has received assurances from
Pakistan, a nuclear power, that it is no longer providing assistance
or vital materiel to the regime of Kim Jong Il. In a telephone
conversation Thursday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf assured
Powell "400%" that his government was not currently facilitating
North Korea's program, the secretary said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said last week that Pakistan was believed
to have supplied components to North Korea for a secret
uranium-enrichment program; the North Koreans admitted to the program
during talks early this month in their capital, Pyongyang, with U.S.
officials. China and Russia also have been mentioned as possible
suppliers. Asian and Pacific nations -- particularly the United
States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea -- hold the keys to
ending North Korea's isolation. And the Bush administration is eager
for them to deliver a clear message to Pyongyang that "giving up its
weapons program is the price of admission to rejoin the world. We
control its hopes for the future, and we can hold those hopes
hostage," a senior State Department official said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   China is especially crucial because it is North Korea's most
important trading partner, while Beijing's Communist leadership has
the closest political ties with Pyongyang's Stalinist regime.</TE>
<TE>   The role of Japan, which tried to engage in rapprochement during a
landmark visit by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Sept. 17, also
will be critical during scheduled talks with North Korea next week.
The U.S. wants Japan to deliver a tough message, despite Tokyo's push
to establish full diplomatic relations with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In his country's first official response, Kim Yong Nam, the
North's ceremonial head of state, said the Communist regime was
willing to discuss its nuclear program. He made the remarks in a
meeting with South Korean delegates in Pyongyang, according to South
Korean pool reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides were in agreement that the issues raised recently
should be resolved expeditiously through dialogue," South Korean
spokesman Rhee Bong Jo said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to U.S. policy on Iraq, American officials said Sunday
that there is not even talk behind the scenes about cutting off
humanitarian aid, on which North Korea relies to feed its people. The
program is tightly supervised to ensure the food goes directly to the
people, not through the government, U.S. officials believe.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration is already coming under fire for its policy
choices. The fact that North Korea is believed to already have one or
two bombs and is developing a capability to build more makes it a
greater danger than Iraq, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, charged Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put the two, North Korea and Iraq, on the scales and ask
the question, 'Which today is the greater threat to the people of the
United States of America?' I would answer the question: North Korea.
And I think that needs to be part of the rebalancing of our foreign
policy priorities," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a growing undercurrent on Capitol Hill, Graham also
criticized the administration for delaying disclosure of North
Korea's stunning confession at the beginning of this month until
after the congressional vote on an Iraq resolution. But Powell
countered that the administration had been extensively briefing
congressional groups about the intelligence findings, first uncovered
in July.</TE>
<TE>   On Iraq, Powell said Sunday that the United States might not seek
the ouster of Hussein if Baghdad agrees to totally surrender its
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles. But
he noted that Iraq is in violation of other U.N. resolutions as well.
Hussein would have to fulfill Iraq's obligations on those issues as
well to satisfy the administration's demands.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said the U.S. will table a new U.N. resolution on Iraq
before all 15 members of the Security Council this week.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelans Are Braced for Strike</HD>
<DH>A nationwide work stoppage called for today will gauge the
depth of opposition to controversial President Hugo Chavez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Six months after being briefly ousted in a coup, Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez appears to have strengthened his grip on power, purging
dissident military officers and frustrating political opponents.</LD>
<LD>   His authority and Venezuela's stability will be tested today as
the fractured opposition attempts to unify the country's workers in a
nationwide strike that promises to be the biggest of its kind since
April.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a strike over management of the state oil company led to a
demonstration and a military coup that left dozens dead. Chavez was
restored to power 48 hours later by loyal military officers backed by
a massive counter-demonstration.</LD>
<TE>   Today's strike appears to be a crucial turning point. If violence
breaks out, there is no telling where events will lead. Just Sunday
night, Chavez announced that his security forces had broken up a plot
to assassinate him over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But a peaceful demonstration with mass participation could signal
that the opposition has settled in for a long struggle that could
lead to a recall election next year.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still people who hope for another coup," said Teodoro
Petkoff, editor of a Caracas newspaper opposed to Chavez. "But there
is now a more democratic, moderate, realistic and sensible faction
that understands this is a marathon, not a 100-yard dash."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that Venezuelan society is any less divided.
Today's strike, like a massive march earlier this month, was designed
to push for Chavez's immediate resignation and new elections.</TE>
<TE>   The deteriorating economy, which contracted 7.1% in the first six
months of this year and saw unemployment soar, has given new
ammunition to opponents who believe that Chavez is destroying the
country. They now label as "Castro communism" his self-styled
revolution, a mix of social and political reforms designed to improve
the living conditions of the 80% of the population living in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Reconciliation efforts have made little headway. Last week, Vice
President Jose Vicente Rangel endorsed an effort by the Organization
of American States to create a structure for peace talks -- the first
time anyone in the Chavez administration has opened the door to
mediation by the body.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, however, responded with their own declaration of how
best to proceed with removing Chavez, issued in the name of the
Democratic Coordinating Committee, the loosely organized umbrella
group for the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The group dismissed the administration's embrace of the OAS
principles as a show designed to delay a true dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are sick and tired of Chavez, of his procrastination,
his lies, his constant deceit," said Anibal Romero, a conservative
political analyst. "Sooner or later, if he doesn't act, we are going
to return to the situation we were in before April."</TE>
<TE>   The push for a more peaceful route toward defeating Chavez seems
to be a strategy of pragmatism.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Chavez has taken steps to rid the military of those
opposed to him. He has shifted around key commanders, cashiered
others and promoted those loyal to him.</TE>
<TE>   There are still plenty of military officers opposed to Chavez. Top
commanders resign in protest on a near-weekly basis. But the staff
changes have left many in the military cautious and disoriented,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "He took advantage of the coup to clean house," said Edgar
Zambrano, a legislator in the opposition party Democratic Action, the
largest in Congress after Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement. "His
supposed control over the military is due to persecution."</TE>
<TE>   For another thing, it has become increasingly clear to many in the
opposition that a coup would result in international condemnation,
including by the United States. The April coup was tacitly endorsed
by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, the U.S. Embassy here issued a statement saying it
would not support any "illegal and/or violent actions" against the
"constitutional and democratically elected government of Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   With a possible war in Iraq, Venezuela's oil has become
increasingly important. Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of
oil to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is a simple question of timing. By law, opponents
cannot call a referendum on whether to hold a new election until next
August. Chavez's term is scheduled to last until 2007.</TE>
<TE>   For most of this year, that August date has seemed frustratingly
distant to Chavez opponents. But the idea of risking a violent coup
instead of waiting seems foolish to many.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is another practical matter: After years of
struggle, no opposition figure has emerged to challenge Chavez. That
means, to the chagrin of many, that Chavez would probably win any
election against a field of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem, and we know it. Venezuela is a country where
there are too many messiahs," said Carlos Fernandez, the head of
Fedecamaras, the nation's largest business group and one of the
leaders of today's strike.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition's more moderate attitude does not mean that
Venezuela is finally at ease.</TE>
<TE>   A surge of coup rumors -- another near-weekly feature of the
political scene -- preceded the march earlier this month that was the
largest since April. Two days later, a second large march by Chavez
supporters served as a vivid demonstration of the country's internal
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Although both protests proceeded smoothly, there were scattered
outbreaks of violence. And last week in Caracas, a brewing
controversy over the local police force -- controlled by Chavez
opponents -- resulted in clouds of tear gas wafting through the
center of the capital shortly after lunch one day.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders from Chavez's political party say the police and military
will be standing by today to prevent violence and that the government
is ready to declare a state of emergency, if need be.</TE>
<TE>   They accuse the opposition of threatening to attack businesses
that open. Opposition figures have denied this and accused Chavez
loyalists of threatening to attack any businesses that stay closed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to be a strike. It is sabotage," said William
Lara, the president of the National Assembly and a close Chavez ally.
"The opposition wants to establish chaos, but the state will respond
with all the tools at its disposal."</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle are Venezuela's poor and middle class. As the
economy has contracted, unemployment has increased to 16%. That's one
reason today's strike will be a test of the depth of the opposition
to Chavez. Staying home will mean real sacrifice for many.</TE>
<TE>   Taxi driver Pedro Cabrera said he would like to support the strike
but cannot afford to.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to last year, I get up earlier, work later and earn
less," Cabrera said as he drove through crowded downtown Caracas last
week. "Neither the government nor Fedecamaras pays the bills. I do."</TE>

<HD>China Polishes Off Rivals in Furniture Production</HD>
<DH>Backed by cheap labor, the country has become the top
exporter to the U.S. in less than 10 years.</DH>
<SE>A Giant Awakens / Second of three parts</SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DONGGUAN, China</DL>
<LD>In a vast climate-controlled room far from the dust and din of the
woodcutting machines, rows of young Chinese women create elaborate
patterns from thin strips of wood. Fingers flying, they shape veneer
into complex patterns of contrasting grains and colors, wooden
tapestries meant to transform mere cabinets into objets d'art.</LD>
<LD>   The workers who craft these designs are paid 40 cents an hour,
which allows factory owner Samuel Kuo to make high-end furniture for
American consumers for 30% less than his U.S. competitors can.</LD>
<LD>   By tapping into the aspirations of China's poor, Kuo has helped
turn a remote stretch of rice paddies in the Pearl River Delta into a
furniture-making powerhouse. His factory is one of thousands churning
out dining room sets, sofas, china cabinets and coffee tables. In
less than a decade, China has become one of the world's leading
furniture producers and the top exporter to the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   "For the next 10 or 15 years, China will be the manufacturing base
for all of the world," said Kuo, 47, whose Lacquer Craft
Manufacturing Co. ships 1,400 containers of furniture -- the
equivalent of 18,200 bedroom sets -- to the United States each month.
"For anything that involves people, China is the place."</TE>
<TE>   An outpouring of Chinese products is reshaping the global economy.
Around the world, makers of everything from bicycles to bath towels
are struggling to survive intense competition from inexpensive,
high-quality Chinese goods. Thousands of factories have closed as
production jobs have moved to China.</TE>
<TE>   That migration has been driven, above all, by low wages. In
furniture, for instance, labor represents 30% of the cost of
production in the U.S. In China, it is less than 7%.</TE>
<TE>   As furniture factories have moved to China, their suppliers and
related businesses have followed, making the country an exceptionally
efficient place to operate. Akzo Nobel, a Dutch-Swedish conglomerate
that is one of the largest suppliers of furniture finishes, has
closed plants in the U.S. and Europe and is opening three factories
in China.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't expand fast enough," said Michael Keith Estes, a
managing director at Akzo Nobel. He predicted that 90% of U.S.
furniture production would move to China within five years. "It's a
sleeping dragon, and it woke up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the Strait</TE>
<TE>   Among the first to move to China were furniture producers from
Taiwan, which were being squeezed by rising wages and land costs at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo, whose family manufactured wooden pool cues in Taichung, a
city in central Taiwan, was among the pioneers. After completing his
military service, Kuo took over the family business, expanded into
furniture and began looking across the Taiwan Strait for a cheaper
place to operate.</TE>
<TE>   That was in the early 1990s, and China was eager to attract
foreign investors. The government wanted to convert the southern city
of Dongguan, 50 miles north of Hong Kong, to an industrial zone
specializing in exports. Officials there offered Kuo tax breaks,
inexpensive land and light regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Long-standing animosity between Taiwan and Beijing complicated
such a move. At the time, Taiwan prohibited direct investments in the
mainland. But entrepreneurs devised ways around the rules, and the
government generally looked the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo set up a factory in Dongguan and started making simple wooden
tables, which he shipped to the U.S. at bargain prices. Quality was
unpredictable. Shoddy packaging fell apart in transit and the
furniture arrived with nicks and dents. It was hard to find a steady
supply of top-grade wood, because China's forests had been depleted
by years of unrestrained logging.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, Kuo turned things around. He imported high-quality
wood, upgraded his machinery and brought in experienced managers from
Taiwan and the U.S. Soon, his Dongguan factory was able to meet the
standards of a growing list of U.S. customers, including prominent
brands such as Ashley, Standard and Progressive. In 1994 he closed
his factory in Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors took note of Kuo's success and followed him across the
strait. Today, 2,000 foreign furniture companies operate in southern
China, 350 of them owned by investors from Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Those Taiwanese-owned factories produce nearly three-quarters of
China's wooden furniture exports. Kuo hopes this mutual dependence
will reduce the likelihood of military conflict between the island
and the mainland. "We speak the same language," said Kuo, whose wife,
Grace, handles the company's finances while his teenage children
attend school in Taiwan and Australia. "We're all Chinese."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Economy and Quality</TE>
<TE>   The road to Kuo's factory in Dalingshan, a township within
Dongguan, is lined with small shops selling wood, paints and
furniture-making supplies. Lacquer Craft is a sprawling complex of
blue-and-white buildings with several huge manufacturing, assembly
and warehouse facilities and four dormitories for Kuo's 5,000
employees.</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning, the factory is bustling. Young men wearing goggles
feed wood into precision cutting machines that fill the room with a
constant screech. Workers drive motorized carts between buildings,
unloading supplies and moving furniture pieces to the next step in
the production process. At the end of the assembly line, workers wrap
dining room chairs and dressers with padding and plastic for the long
sea voyage.</TE>
<TE>   By the time it reaches the showroom of a Macy's or a Levitz, the
furniture commands prices ranging from $300 for an end table to as
much as $4,000 for a dining room set.</TE>
<TE>   At each step of the manufacturing process, Kuo tries to shave
costs without compromising quality. He does this by combining modern
technology with manual labor.</TE>
<TE>   He has purchased some of the world's most expensive wood-measuring
and -cutting machines, so waste is minimized and furniture parts will
fit together seamlessly. But he relies on human hands for fine
decorative touches or for rote labor that in China can be done at low
cost. For instance, Kuo economizes on raw materials by purchasing
cheap wood for certain uses and paying workers to cut out the
knotholes.</TE>
<TE>   In the "veneer room," hundreds of women piece together intricate
designs. The ornamentation enhances the appearance of a cabinet or a
bureau and thus its market value. That is not the only reason Kuo is
fond of veneer. Every last piece of wood is used, so there is far
less waste and more furniture can be made from the same quantity of
timber.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the best veneer room in the world," said Winsor White, an
American furniture designer living in the Philippines who came out of
semi-retirement to work for Kuo. "No one in the U.S. can afford to do
that today."</TE>
<TE>   Once a piece is completed, it heads down a mile-long, serpentine
finishing line with 19 spraying stations and 300 workers, more than
twice as many as would be found in a U.S. factory. Each item gets
extra sanding, buffing and finishing, attention reserved for only the
most expensive furniture in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo has no trouble filling jobs. An estimated 10 million laborers
from across China, more than 60% of them women, are looking for work
in Guangdong province. Their hours are long and the labor grueling,
sometimes dangerous. They keep at it because their paychecks help
feed the families they left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Among Kuo's employees is Dai Zhiying, 23, from a village in Hunan
province in central China. Dai's education ended with elementary
school. As a teenager, she took a job driving a truck at a cement
factory for $36 a month. Six years ago, she followed relatives to
Dongguan, where she held a series of jobs in clothing factories, each
offering a few cents more per hour than the one before.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, Dai took a job on the drawer assembly line at Kuo's
company. Lacquer Craft stood out from the city's other export
factories because it gave regular raises and performance bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2,000 Drawers Per Shift</TE>
<TE>   The workday starts at 7:30 a.m. and lasts until 8 p.m., with
breaks for lunch and dinner. During each shift, Dai and her
co-workers assemble 2,000 drawers, more than three per minute.
Employees live six or eight to a room in rent-free company
dormitories and pay about $7 a month for three meals a day. They
relax by watching television or a rented movie in a communal
screening room or playing basketball in the courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Dai and her husband, a painter at Lacquer Craft, have moved into
an apartment outside the factory with their year-old baby. She now
makes about $50 to $60 a month, 25% more than she made at the cement
factory in Hunan. "These factories are all the same," she said. "But
my friends told me, 'If you stay at Lacquer Craft, your salary will
go up.' "</TE>
<TE>   Salaries average $100 a month for production workers at Lacquer
Craft, Kuo said.</TE>
<TE>   After six years with the company, Mei Xiaoli earns $240 a month as
a supervisor in the machine room, 12 times the average income of a
Chinese peasant. Every new year, Mei, 25, joins the migration back
home to his village in northern China's Henan province. But after
visiting his family, he said, he always is eager to return.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is very slow in my hometown," he said. "I came here
to make money."</TE>
<TE>   Kuo said it's in his interest to offer his workers progress toward
a better life, however gradual. Employees who are treated well are
less likely to defect to one of his competitors. Lower turnover
reduces training costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Under communism, people all got the same pay," he said. "Now,
people will jump to another job for a penny an hour more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buying a Brand</TE>
<TE>   As competitors flooded into China, Kuo realized that he couldn't
compete on low prices alone. After studying the U.S. market, he
became convinced that having a brand of his own was the best way to
increase sales and profit.</TE>
<TE>   As a supplier, Kuo was not in control of his production. The large
American furniture brands that were his major customers told him what
to make and how much. Kuo wanted to sell directly to retailers. But
he knew that an unknown Chinese brand stood little chance of success.</TE>
<TE>   Then Kuo heard that one of his biggest clients, Universal
Furniture Ltd., based in High Point, N.C., was up for sale. Last year
Kuo paid an undisclosed sum, believed by industry analysts to be at
least $25 million, to acquire Universal's brand name and its sales
and marketing network. He did not want its factories in the United
States and Asia, which were sold or closed.</TE>
<TE>   The marriage of Universal Furniture's name with Kuo's low-cost
production base has been lucrative, he reports. Though overall U.S.
furniture sales have been slumping, Kuo said the demand for his
ornately carved dining room sets and veneered cabinets has been so
strong that he plans to spend $20 million building new production
capacity in China.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo said furniture manufacturing is in China to stay. One reason
is that the country's population -- at 1.3 billion the world's
largest -- ensures an almost endless supply of cheap labor. Millions
of peasants will travel across the country for even a meager
paycheck. As wages rise in industrial areas such as Dongguan,
manufacturers can open factories elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo has started building a second factory near Shanghai, where
wages are lower than in southern China and government incentives even
more appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "China is getting stronger and stronger," Kuo said. "It still has
10 to 15 years to go before it reaches the next level. But compared
to 10 years ago, it has come a long, long ways."</TE>

<KH>A GIANT AWAKES</KH>
<HD>Chinese Imports Force Innovation</HD>
<DH>As many U.S. furniture makers scale back or go out of
business, some are reinventing themselves to stay competitive.</DH>
<SE>A GIANT AWAKES</SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson and Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheap imports have shuttered many a U.S. furniture plant. Determined
that his Los Angeles factory would not meet the same fate, John Boyd
found a way to capitalize on low-cost Chinese manufacturing.</LD>
<LD>   He began importing furniture and parts from China last year to cut
costs. At the same time, he reorganized his own manufacturing
operation to focus on areas in which he had an edge on the Chinese:
small production runs, original designs, a rainbow of finishes and
fast delivery.</LD>
<LD>   The mix of imports and innovation has led to lower prices and
higher sales for John Boyd Designs, a maker of moderately priced
bedroom, dining room and office furniture. While the U.S. furniture
industry is shedding jobs, Boyd has increased his staff by one-third,
to 180 workers.</LD>
<TE>   "They forced me to reinvent myself," Boyd said of the Chinese. "If
I were still making everything myself, I'd be out of business by
now."</TE>
<TE>   A flood of Chinese imports is forcing U.S. furniture makers to
re-engineer their businesses. Some are upgrading technology to drive
down costs. Others are trying to find niche markets or beat foreign
competitors by offering better service.</TE>
<TE>   And some of the best-known U.S. brands are closing their domestic
plants and shifting production to China.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern Decline</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Chinese imports has been felt most keenly in the
South, the traditional home of the U.S. furniture industry. Of 69,000
American furniture jobs that have disappeared in the last year,
11,500 were in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Furniture Brands International Inc. of St. Louis, the country's
largest furniture company, shuttered five factories in North Carolina
and Virginia and cut 1,200 jobs last year. Drexel Heritage Furniture
Industries Inc. of Drexel, N.C., has shaved its U.S. production over
the last decade from 12 plants employing 3,800 people to four plants
with 2,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Young, the new head of Drexel (now part of Furniture Brands),
says the downsizing is not over. "I wouldn't want our employees to
read this," he said, "but fundamentally, one day ... we'll primarily
be a marketing arm, with the labor overseas."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure also is being felt in Southern California, the
nation's second-largest furniture-producing region, with more than
1,500 firms and 55,000 workers. Over the last two years, California
has lost 10% of its furniture manufacturing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   For U.S. firms, the message is clear: Innovate or face extinction.</TE>
<TE>   The survival strategy adopted by John Bassett, president of
Vaughan-Bassett Furniture Co. in Galax, Va., is to improve service
while cutting costs.</TE>
<TE>   Bassett promises to deliver furniture to customers 10 days after
receiving an order, one-third the average wait. He has invested $42
million in the latest automated equipment for his four plants,
reducing labor costs and speeding production. The plants turn out as
many as 100 dressers an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughan-Bassett can produce bedroom sets -- a bed, a chest and a
dresser -- that sell for $999, among the lowest retail prices on the
market.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm saying is, before you turn tail and run, why don't you
put up a good fight?" Bassett said.</TE>
<TE>   In an industrial section of South-Central Los Angeles, Decotec
Furniture Manufacturing Co. has taken a different tack. The last few
years have been tough for the company, a maker of casual metal dining
furniture. Sales have dropped 50%.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't going to spend $2,500 on a dinette set when they're
worried about the economy," said Bill Mann, the company's owner and
president.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than become an importer, Mann decided to cut his production
costs. He laid off 10 of his 15 workers, scoured auctions for used
manufacturing equipment and began making his own decorative metalwork
instead of buying it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selling by the Internet</TE>
<TE>   Mann found that he still could not manufacture as cheaply as the
Chinese. So he tried a new approach: selling some of his products
directly to retail customers via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Decotec's biggest clients are furniture stores, which add a hefty
markup before selling the merchandise to consumers. By cutting out
intermediaries, Mann reasoned, he could keep more profit for himself
and still offer lower prices than many retailers charge for imports.</TE>
<TE>   That is a risky strategy. Manufacturers who compete with their
retailers risk losing them as customers. In addition, many shoppers
are reluctant to make a major purchase over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   So Mann decided to experiment with a single category -- bar stools
-- offering half a dozen styles online for $150 to $200 each. To keep
his retailers happy, he agreed to give them a cut of any sale
originating in their territories.</TE>
<TE>   In a little more than a year, Mann said, sales from
Barstools4u.com have grown to represent about 25% of his business.
"It has kept me afloat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mann doesn't blame China for his woes. A history buff, the
60-year-old believes many of the world's conflicts are caused by
hunger and hopelessness. A more prosperous China, he reasons, will be
a peaceful China, capable of buying more U.S. goods.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, it's a good thing," Mann said. "It's the short
run that's painful."</TE>
<TE>   Deep in the foothills of the Appalachians, the heartland of the
U.S. furniture industry, the pain is particularly acute.</TE>
<TE>   Marion, N.C., is home to 5,000 people, four dozen Baptist churches
and several big furniture factories. When Universal Furniture Ltd.
closed its plant there last year, 300 well-paid jobs were lost. Every
day brings a new rumor that one of the remaining factories -- Drexel,
Ethan Allen or Broyhill -- will be next.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that people in China need to feed their families,"
said Anna Smalley, 60, a former Universal employee, "but I wish
they'd left some jobs for us."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Wilkerson couldn't find another factory job when he lost
his $11.85-an-hour position in the cutting room at Universal. So he
got his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in an auto body
repair program at a community college. Wilkerson, his wife and
10-year-old son are barely scraping by on his wife's $6.50-an-hour
housekeeping job at a Comfort Inn.</TE>
<TE>   In a string of factory jobs too numerous to recall, Universal
stands out in Wilkerson's mind as the only place that gave its
employees a little something extra: an annual family excursion to
Dollywood, entertainer Dolly Parton's Smoky Mountains theme park in
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of sad to say," Wilkerson said, "but we had it made and
didn't know it."</TE>

<HD>Young Priests Hold Old Values</HD>
<DH>Their views often are at odds with liberal reform of
Vatican II in 1960s.</DH>
<SE>Second of two parts</SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Younger Roman Catholic priests in the United States are markedly more
conservative than their elders, a Los Angeles Times poll has found,
reflecting a global trend toward Christian orthodoxy that is
reshaping the world's largest church.</LD>
<LD>   Clerics under age 41 expressed more allegiance to the clerical
hierarchy, less dissent against traditional church teachings, and
more certainty about the sinfulness of homosexuality, abortion,
artificial birth control and other moral issues than did their
elders, the poll found.</LD>
<LD>   Those attitudes place the younger priests at odds with many
priests who were shaped by the liberal reforms of the Second Vatican
Council in the 1960s and who tend to support further changes in the
church -- including women priests, optional celibacy, more lay
empowerment and the direct election of bishops.</LD>
<TE>   The poll found that overall, 30% of priests described themselves
as liberal on religious and moral issues, while 28% described
themselves as conservative and 37% as moderate. Among younger
priests, however, nearly four in 10 described themselves as
conservative, and three-fourths said they were more religiously
orthodox than their older counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   The shift to orthodoxy has been actively promoted by Pope John
Paul II during his 24-year pontificate. In addition to their
predominance among the younger generation of American priests,
orthodox views are in the ascendancy worldwide as Catholicism's
center of gravity shifts from liberal Europe and North America to the
more conservative regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America,
according to scholars of the church.</TE>
<TE>   As the influence of those regions grows in the American church --
in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, for example, Latinos and Asians
already constitute more than 80% of the faithful -- disagreements
over the U.S. institution's future are certain to deepen, many
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The church has developed a fissure whose size most people do not
fully appreciate," said Philip Jenkins, a Pennsylvania State
University professor and author of "The Next Christendom."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll surveyed a nationwide sample of 1,854 priests in 80
U.S. dioceses. The survey is the most extensive independent
nationwide poll of Catholic priests since a similar Times poll
conducted in 1993 and 1994. The margin of error is plus or minus 3
percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The poll paints a portrait of a gradually diversifying and aging
priesthood. Eighty-eight percent of priests are non-Latino whites --
a figure that is down a few percentage points from the last Times
poll but remains higher than the white percentage among lay
Catholics. Younger priests are also considerably more likely to
identify themselves as gay than are those who were ordained in
earlier decades.</TE>
<TE>   As the number of new priests graduating from seminaries fails to
keep pace with the number reaching retirement age, the average age of
a Catholic priest has risen to nearly 61; in the 1994 survey it was
54.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Great Expectations</TE>
<TE>   The survey shows the vast majority of priests to be happy with
their vocations, but the shortage of priests causes many to struggle
with burnout. Some talk of feeling caught between what one poll
respondent referred to as "a bishop who expects everything and a
people who expect everything."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the poll, the clearest divide was the one between the
younger and older generation.
..TE
That gap is reflected in men like Father Vincent Inghilterra, a
60-year-old Army chaplain based in the Diocese of Trenton, N.J., and
Father Matthew O'Donnell, a 39-year-old pastor from San Andreas, which is
east of Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Inghilterra came of age during Vatican II. The Second Vatican
Council was launched by Pope John XXIII in 1962 as a way to "bring
the church up to date." The council launched a revolutionary effort
to bring the church closer to the people by emphasizing a greater
role for the laity, declaring the primacy of individual conscience
and abandoning centuries of traditional practices, such as Latin
Masses. Particularly in the United States, the reform ideas
associated with Vatican II strongly influenced a generation of
priests.</TE>
<TE>   Influenced by such dissident theologians as Hans Kung and Charles
Curran, who were both subsequently investigated by John Paul II's
more orthodox Vatican, Inghilterra said he was encouraged to open all
subjects to examination and to think for himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Careful Approach</TE>
<TE>   "I was taught to be very respectful of the conscience of people
and not denounce everything as a sin," he said. "The Catholic people
will do what they feel is right in their hearts -- with or without
the blessing of the local priest."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell was raised in West Covina with such traditional Catholic
practices as nightly family rosaries and frequent attendance at daily
Mass. But he said that he, like many younger Catholics, longed for
stability and certainty amid a climate of moral relativism, sexual
permissiveness, social degeneration and a sense that the experiments
of Vatican II had created more confusion than success.</TE>
<TE>   In his seven years as a priest, O'Donnell said, he has gently but
firmly laid down church teachings -- telling one couple who had wed
in a civil ceremony, for instance, that they could not receive
Communion unless they married within the church.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty and liberty comes in accepting church teachings, not
making your own theology," O'Donnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Many younger priests, like O'Donnell, see themselves as carrying
out the mission of the pope. Indeed, the poll found that younger
priests who came of age after Vatican II and during John Paul's
papacy were the most positive toward him, with 79% ranking him
outstanding. That compared with 60% of Vatican II-generation priests,
and 64% of pre-Vatican II priests 60 years of age and older.</TE>
<TE>   Three-fourths of younger priests ranked the pope's moral views as
"about right," compared with 60% of Vatican II-era priests and 61% of
pre-Vatican II clerics. About one-third of the older two groups found
John Paul's views "too conservative."</TE>
<TE>   To priests such as O'Donnell, the pope represents "a guiding light
and a strength." Amid social and religious confusion, he said, "Pope
John Paul II speaks with certainty, love and compassion. This is what
young people need."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to their admiration for the pope, the younger priests
surveyed were more upbeat about the church in general, with 69%
ranking conditions "excellent" or "good" compared with 56% among
priests of the Vatican II generation, defined by Catholic officials
as those ages 42 to 59.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Empower the Laity'</TE>
<TE>   The younger priests were more apt to believe that no reform is
needed in the church, compared with priests of the Vatican II
generation, who most frequently chose "democratization" and "empower
the laity" from a list of possible reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Younger priests were also far more likely to fully embrace
traditional church teachings -- and expect the same from their fellow
Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   While 72% of Vatican II priests said Roman Catholics could
disagree with some church teachings and remain faithful, only 48% of
younger priests agreed with that proposition. The younger priests
were the most likely to regard as "always a sin" such acts as
premarital sex, abortion, artificial birth control, cloning, using
fetal stem cells for research, gay sex, masturbation and wearing
condoms as protection against AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of younger priests opposed the ordination of
women as deacons or priests, although a narrow majority favored
ordination of married men as priests in the Latin, or Western, rite.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, among the older priests, large majorities favored
women deacons and ordination of married men as priests; among the
Vatican II-era priests, 51% also supported the ordination of women as
priests.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortage of Priests</TE>
<TE>The differences between liberal and conservative priests color views
on everything from the cause of sex scandals that have rocked the
church to the solution for shortages of priests -- a problem named as
the church's most pressing issue by the largest number of respondents
across the ideological spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals argue that the church must open the priesthood to women
and married men. But many conservatives assert that the dioceses and
religious orders headed by orthodox leaders are brimming with people
eager to devote themselves to the religious life.</TE>
<TE>An example frequently cited by conservatives is the Diocese of
Lincoln, Neb., home to 90,000 Catholics</TE>
<TE>According to Msgr. Timothy J. Thorburn, the diocesan vicar-general,
the number of candidates for the priesthood or religious orders is
growing at both seminaries in the area, and within three orders of
nuns -- including a new Carmelite monastery of cloistered women
established last December.</TE>
<TE>   One of the seminaries, Thorburn said, recently had to expand its
quarters to accommodate the surge of young men -- more than 60 --
attracted to the Latin liturgies and other traditional practices of
the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Thorburn called the priest shortage "a short-term problem" that
would be solved in a few decades by the return to orthodoxy. "Young
people with ideals are not looking for the easy path," he said. "A
'Catholic lite' is not attractive to them."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics fear that younger, conservative clerics will alienate
a more liberal Catholic lay population. But conservatives argue that
orthodoxy is growing among the laity as well.</TE>
<TE>   According to Father Joseph Fessio, editor of the conservative
Ignatius Press in San Francisco, about 20 new Catholic magazines have
been launched in the last two decades -- all of them orthodox.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Catholics, he added, have started a host of new
organizations, such as St. Joseph Communications, which holds an
annual family conference in Long Beach that has grown from 300
participants when it began a decade or so ago to 7,000 today. In
addition, he and others assert that younger families are having more
children and increasingly choosing to home-school them.</TE>
<TE>   As the Catholic population continues to change complexion, with
increasing numbers of the faithful coming from immigrant communities,
Jenkins and other experts say, ideological conflict between younger
traditionalists and an older generation of reformers is bound to
increase.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, for instance, conflict frequently occurs
over the role of the laity, said Father Thomas Rausch of Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles. Discomfort "comes out all the
time" from younger priests over the issue of treating lay pastoral
associates as equal, professional partners, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that these younger Catholics not become so
enamored with tradition that they lose sight of the need for greater
inclusion of the laity or a more collective style of decision
making," Rausch said. "Laypeople are claiming their ministry and
won't have it taken away from them by some conservative cleric."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent essay in the national Catholic magazine America,
however, Rausch wrote that he had also become more sympathetic to
some of the concerns of the younger, more conservative theologians.</TE>
<TE>   "After all the confusion and 'Cafeteria Catholicism' in the
post-Vatican II climate," he said, referring to the practice of
selective adherence to church teachings, "there is a real desire for
a greater sense of Catholic identity, more Jesus-centered piety and a
rediscovery of the purity of the tradition."</TE>
<TE>   He called on the church and its theologians to bridge the growing
divide.</TE>
<TE>   To many Catholics, however, diverse opinion is as old as the
church itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been a community that thought the same way,"
Inghilterra said. "We're richer for the diversity."</TE>

<LD>The Times Poll results are based on 1,854 responses from priests
nationwide to a survey conducted by mail from June 27 to Oct. 11.
Survey results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</LD>
<LD>   The responses represent a 37% return from a sample of 5,000 active
and retired priests in 80 dioceses chosen to be geographically
distributed in the same way as the 45,382 priests who make up the
total U.S. priest population. Diocesan priests and those in religious
orders were included in proportion to their overall share of the
total priest population in each geographic area. Addresses and
population counts were taken from directories of dioceses and
religious orders and from the Official Catholic Directory published
by P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons.</LD>
<LD>   The survey was supervised by Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan
Pinkus along with Associate Director Jill Darling Richardson and
Field Director Roger Richardson. Claudia Vaughn was the data
management supervisor, and Ray Enslow was the publications
coordinator.</LD>

<LD>In life, Scott Springer was a popular figure in his tidy Westlake
Village neighborhood. In death, he's a genuine fixture.</LD>
<LD>   Friends greet him every day. His wife, Debbie, chats at him when
she's feeling down. His son throws off a cheerful "Hi, Dad" to a tree

arrayed around the yard to be admired or meditated on, whether
survivors are gardening or grilling hamburgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our motto is: 'Keeping your memory close to home,' " said Stephen
Hartmann, marketing director of the company. "A lot of people find an
urn on the mantel creepy. We did research and discovered that people
liked the rocks much better. It's a place to go, and it looks good in
the yard."</TE>
<TE>   As cremation rates climb nationwide, more people are finding
creative ways to display the ashes of their loved ones and
commemorate their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral directors say aging baby boomers find traditional urns
grim and old-fashioned. They want something befitting their
personalities and lifestyles: a bronze-and-gold King Tut mask
perhaps, or an enormous, fiberglass toad.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not your mom and dad's funeral practice anymore," said one
funeral director. "People want variety."</TE>
<TE>   The trend is largely driven by a national cremation rate that's
risen from 9% in 1982 to about 26% as of 2001, according to the
Cremation Assn. of North America. The Chicago-based group consists of
1,500 funeral homes, crematories, casket makers and cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always asking us about interesting things to do with
cremated remains," said its executive director, Jack Springer.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, he's seen urns shaped like golf bags,
cowboy boots and lifelike busts of the deceased. A New Zealand woman
makes them from hollow ostrich eggs, which she fills with ashes,
decorates with semiprecious stones and sells for about $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, the association said, nearly 40% of all Americans will be
cremated. The ancient practice owes its newfound popularity to an
increasingly transient population, a loosening of religious
strictures, more environmental awareness and simple economics,
Springer said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are dying older and dying away from home," he said. "There
aren't as many family plots. With cremation, you can take the remains
with you when you move."</TE>
<TE>   Batesville Casket Co., one of the nation's largest manufacturers
of urns and coffins, has a full-color catalog with more than 100
models of vessels, ranging from mule deer to starfish.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a generational study ... and found the older generation
still preferred tradition, while the baby boomers wanted something
different and personal," said Joe Weigel, head of communications for
the Batesville, Ind., company.</TE>
<TE>   "We found they still wanted to honor the dead," he added. "But
they ... want to celebrate the life, not just mourn the death. And
there is a growing movement to bring those cremations home."</TE>
<TE>   The company broke with tradition and created an urn with three
dolphins on top in 1993. Sales soared, and the dolphin is now a
staple in funeral homes across the country. "That's still the most
popular urn, and the one that put us on the map," Weigel said. "When
we saw the sales, we said, 'Wow!' "</TE>
<TE>   The Clausen Funeral Home in Ojai recently opened an urn showroom
that features some wooden urns etched with mountain and sports
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person is a golfer, we have a golfing motif. If they are a
fisherman, we have a fishing motif," said Chester Perry, funeral
director at Clausen. In addition to urns, he said, "we have a
birdbath, a water fountain with an urn beneath, a sundial and a
rock."</TE>
<TE>   Teri Craig, whose family has run the Charles Carroll Funeral Home
in Ventura for 49 years, offers "cremation jewelry": lockets and
pendants that can hold small amounts of ashes. "It's part of hanging
on to someone special," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The jewelry got started in 1992 when Lisa Saxer-Buros of Wisconsin
wanted a special way to remember her mother, Madelyn. She designed
hollow pendants, each holding a half-teaspoon of her mother's ashes,
and distributed them to her siblings for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Now her Madelyn Co., based in Janesville, Wis., sells 30 styles of
cremation jewelry, from hearts and crosses to butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   "I wear my pendant all the time," Saxer-Buros said. "It's
comforting to touch and wear, especially in situations where I need
my mother close."</TE>
<TE>   LifeGem, a Chicago company, can convert the carbon in human ashes
into diamonds that can be mounted and worn. During cremation, a
filter collects carbon from the remains. The material is taken to a
laboratory, where it's superheated and pressed to create diamonds.
Each comes with a certificate of authenticity from a gemologist.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred diamonds ranging from .25 to 1.3 carats can be created
from a single person's remains. Prices range from $3,950 to $27,950.</TE>
<TE>   "To be buried in a cemetery these days is to be easily forgotten,"
said Dean vanBieson, vice president of operations at LifeGem, which
made its first diamond this year. "Diamonds are perfect; you can take
them with you. We crystallize your memory."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Gage, a 35-year-old salon owner in Rockford, Ill., figures
she's already a diamond in the rough; why not become the real thing
when she dies?</TE>
<TE>   "My husband will do the same thing," she said of their joint plans
for gem-hood. "We could become true family heirlooms."</TE>
<TE>   But gems, necklaces and designer urns fill some with horror.</TE>
<TE>   "We would 100% discourage it. The body is not born to be burned,"
said Rabbi Chaim Kolodny, a Los Angeles cleric who volunteers with
Chevra Kadisha, a group providing traditional burials for Orthodox
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish tradition, along with those of Islam and Christianity, long
held cremation to be at odds with divine commands that the dead go
back into the earth.</TE>
<TE>   Martha White, sales and marketing director at Mount Sinai Memorial
Parks and Mortuaries in Los Angeles and Simi Valley, said: "If some
new style of urn helps people connect to someone, I can understand,
but it has no connection for me. Family stories should be carried
forward, not the physical things."</TE>
<TE>   Old-fashioned burial remains the norm in most parts of the
country. It's preferred in the Bible Belt, where people move around
less and religious traditions proscribing cremation remain strong.
Alabama has the lowest cremation rate in America, at 5%, while
Mississippi and Tennessee are about 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Cremation is most popular in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii has the highest cremation rate at 60%, followed by Nevada,
at 58%, and Washington state, at 57%. California is at 47% and is
expected to reach 65% by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "Cremation was seen as a very radical ... idea in the 19th
century," said David Sloan, a USC professor who is an expert on
cemeteries and urban history. "It was seen as scientific, rational
and a rejection of religious ritual. But it lost its stigma, and has
very recently become part of the accepted ritual of death."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 study by the cremation association, 24% of respondents
said they had chosen cremation because it was less expensive than
burial; 17% cited environmental concerns; and 13% said it was a
simpler way to dispose of a body.</TE>
<TE>   Cremation of the average adult requires 1,800 degrees of heat for
about 90 minutes, said Miguel Andrade, a crematory operator at Ivy
Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura. A body in a coffin is rolled into a
brick chamber, a heavy blue door shuts and gas flames are turned on.</TE>
<TE>   When the cremation is done, Andrade puts on a heat-proof suit,
stands in front of the oven and sweeps the ashes into a metal tray.
He uses a magnet to pick up any pins or screws that may have been
left from medical treatments.</TE>
<TE>   The ashes are then pulverized into a fine powder. The remains,
which weigh 7 to 8 pounds, are put in a plastic urn and given to the
family.</TE>
<TE>   The cremation association says a no-frills cremation costs about
$1,000; a basic burial costs about $1,250. But burial prices are
easily pushed up by such expenses as caskets, embalming fees,
cemetery plots and clergy costs.</TE>
<TE>   Though urns can cost more than $3,000, they also can be bought for
as little as $80. Most specialty urns run between $200 and $800,
industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Some people skip the urn entirely, taking the ashes and scattering
them at home, at sea or somewhere else special to the living or the
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Ashes can also be molded into customized shapes. Eternal Reefs of
Decatur, Ga., mixes them with concrete, forms them into balls and
uses them to make artificial reefs along the East Coast and the Gulf
of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a final resting place that gives back to the environment as
a final gesture," said the company's owner, Don Brawley. "I got the
idea when my father-in-law said he'd rather spend eternity with the
snappers and groupers than with a bunch of dead people in a field."</TE>
<TE>   It was burial prices that persuaded Connie Owens, 47, of Laguna
Niguel to buy a boulder urn from Rock &amp; Water for her father's ashes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect," she said. "He's always there in the backyard, and
my mother can go talk to him. You don't have to drive to the
cemetery, and when you move, you can take him with you."</TE>
<TE>   Others remain squeamish.</TE>
<TE>   Ron White, director of White's Funeral Home in Azusa, has helped
arrange hundreds of cremations. He even had his cat cremated. But he
won't be joining his pet in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure I've taken too good care of my body to burn it up when
I'm dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That goes double for Chester Perry of the Clausen Funeral Home.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something about being consumed by fire that bothers me,"
he said, wincing slightly. "I've arranged to be buried in a T-shirt
and shorts."</TE>

<LD>Worried state and local governments are looking to the Arkansas
Supreme Court to block a vote on a popular ballot measure that would
eliminate the state's sales tax on food and medicine. The state's
highest court could rule this week.</LD>
<LD>   Polls show widespread support for the measure, sponsored by the
Libertarian Party, which backers say would wipe out a regressive levy
that falls hardest on the poor. Opponents, however, say it would gut
funding to run much of state and local government, because it makes
no provision for replacing lost revenue.</LD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration plans to shorten the period of time that
patents can protect exclusive marketing of brand-name drugs in an
effort to get generic prescription medicines on the market more
quickly, a senior administration official said Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations being proposed by the administration will restrict
the opportunities for major drug companies to seek patent extensions
based on minor changes to packaging or changes that occur to drugs
once they are ingested.</LD>
<LD>   The administration expects the plan will save consumers, the
federal and state governments -- particularly the Medicare and
Medicaid programs -- and insurers at least $3 billion a year by
speeding up the use of generic drugs, which generally cost less than
brand-name drugs.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush plans to announce the proposed regulations this
morning at a White House ceremony, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. They would take effect shortly after a 60-day
comment period, during which major drug manufacturers are expected to
file strenuous objections.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we are on quite solid legal grounds," the administration
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would not require approval by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   By announcing the plan immediately after members of Congress have
left Washington for the final two weeks of intense campaigning before
the midterm elections, the White House likely has avoided turning the
plan into a central debating point between the Democratic-led Senate
and the Republican administration.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional efforts to create a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare collapsed over the summer, despite intense lobbying by the
AARP and other senior citizen groups. The Senate pushed ahead with a
proposal to ease access to generic drugs, but Congress has not
completed work on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Generic Pharmaceuticals Assn., an organization that represents
the manufacturers of generic drugs, hailed the administration's
proposal Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very supportive," said Kathleen Jaeger, the president and
CEO of the Washington-based organization.</TE>
<TE>   The White House is presenting the plan as part of its response to
complaints that Medicare does too little to help the elderly pay the
dramatically increasing costs of prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Under current regulations, when major drug manufacturers' patents
expire, they frequently can block production of generic drugs by
other companies by filing for new patents based on changes in
packaging and minor chemical changes in the product.</TE>
<TE>   Under the administration's proposal, the companies would be given
a 30-month period beyond the current patent for exclusive production
of the drug. But they would not be allowed to file for repeated
patent extensions.</TE>
<TE>   A recently completed administration study of patent extensions
during the period from 1992 to 2000 found at least seven cases in
which major brand-name drugs were given multiple patent extensions,
blocking the production and sale of identical, but much cheaper,
generic drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "This action is a direct, immediate and rapid response" to that
study, the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that the Food and Drug Administration had found
that generic drugs, while essentially the same chemically, were sold
for roughly one-third the cost of the brand-name product.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement, disclosed in a conference call to reporters,
follows a recommendation by the Federal Trade Commission that
patent-holders be given one automatic 30-month stay to allow them
time to mount legal challenges to applications for generic production
of a drug.</TE>
<TE>   The period of 30 months was chosen, the official said, because
that was the typical amount of time required for litigation to work
its way through the federal district courts in such patent cases.</TE>

<HD>Confession Revives Issues in Notorious 'Wilding' Case</HD>
<DH>Five convictions in the 1989 rape of a jogger in New York's
Central Park are called into question after DNA tests and a
prisoner's admission of guilt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was a crime that sickened New York and stunned the nation: Five
black youths savagely beat and raped a lone woman jogging through
Central Park, leaving her for dead. They had gone on a rampage,
attacking numerous people, and violated the 28-year-old white woman
for blood sport.</LD>
<LD>   Or did they?</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen years after the racially incendiary case made world
headlines and reinforced New York's image as a dangerous, lawless
place, DNA testing has concluded that another man -- a rapist serving
33 years to life in prison -- may have been the sole attacker. The
jogger, now recovered, remembers nothing of the crime.</LD>
<TE>   "I was a monster," said Matias Reyes, 31, insisting that he alone
stalked and brought down the Salomon Bros. investment banker on an
April night in 1989 when mayhem filled the park. "And I just had to
have her."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes' confession has reopened a chilling case that most New
Yorkers thought was settled long ago. And it has ignited furious
demands by attorneys representing the five youths -- who have served
their time and now are grown men -- that their rape convictions be
set aside by Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Morgenthau will brief New York Supreme Court Justice
Eduardo Padro about his investigation of the newly reopened case. He
is expected to ask for a one-month extension for his exhaustive
review, which involves going over 15,000 pages of transcripts and
re-interviewing dozens of witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   He also is probing the credibility of Reyes, who said a religious
awakening prompted him to come forward in January. Because the
statute of limitations on rape has expired, he cannot be prosecuted
for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that the so-called Central Park Five might be innocent
has triggered recriminations and disbelief, sparking racial frictions
that were far more typical here in the late 1980s than in today's
more peaceful climate. When it became public, the crime introduced
America to the concept of "wilding," a frenzied crime spree carried
out by juveniles roaming in packs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the jogger case changed the city dramatically -- helping
to spur a tough anti-crime crackdown several years later -- its
troubling legacy has affected people in different ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Race has always been the 800-pound gorilla in this case," said
Eugene O'Donald, a political science professor at John Jay College of
Criminal Law and a former assistant district attorney. "People view
this differently from different sides of the racial divide. You want
to believe police would act fairly, but you'd be kidding yourself not
to see that there could have been a rush to judgment here."</TE>
<TE>   Although many women were traumatized by the crime and the specter
of youths "wilding" in the park, African American parents were
equally paralyzed by fears that their sons could be picked up by the
New York police at random and charged with crimes they didn't commit.</TE>
<TE>   "They were innocent of all the charges," said Michael Warren, who
represents three of the convicted men. "They served [time] in prison
for something they never did. This terrible stigma has to be
removed."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, city officials are trying to piece together a horrific
night of violence that former Mayor Edward I. Koch called "one of the
most brutal, unforgettable atrocities in the modern history of this
city."</TE>
<TE>   It was an evening when an estimated 30 to 33 teenagers were
roaming through the northern part of the park, throwing stones at
cabdrivers, beating up bicyclists and harassing homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Around 9:30 p.m., the woman entered Central Park on the Upper East
Side near the 102nd Street transverse, a popular jogging path.
Sometime around 10:05 she was attacked and dragged into a ravine,
where she was raped. Her skull was crushed and she lost most of the
blood in her body. When passersby discovered her at 1 a.m., the
nearly nude woman was barely alive, and investigators were prepared
to classify the case as a homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the jogger miraculously recovered after months of intensive
care and rehabilitative therapy. Today she is married, lives in
Connecticut and is preparing to tell her story in a book to be
published next year. Although she suffers from double vision and a
greatly diminished sense of smell, she has gone on with her life. She
"is as interested as anyone else to know what happened that night,"
said her agent, Joni Evans.</TE>
<TE>   When police officers began responding to reports of the frenzied
Central Park attacks, they took several teenagers into custody and,
after a lengthy interrogation, came up with the names of five
suspects who lived in nearby Harlem. Within a week, prosecutors
believed they had cracked the case.</TE>
<TE>   Yet facts that seemed etched in stone 13 years ago are now
suspect. Although the youths made damning videotaped confessions,
advocates say they were coerced by police. Jurors were swayed by
physical evidence during the trial, such as a blond hair apparently
from the victim found on one teenager's clothes. New forensic testing
has shown that the hair did not come from the jogger.</TE>
<TE>   And the most nagging fact is that there was no forensic or DNA
evidence linking the youths to the crime, even though the victim had
bled profusely.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials continue to insist that the right people
were convicted. They believe the often-graphic videotaped confessions
recorded in the wee hours after the attack remain the single most
important evidence in the case. Although lawyers for the defendants
attacked the validity of the confessions during the 1990 trials,
saying police had bullied their young clients, the court ruled the
tapes were admissible.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, police had long believed that one of the attackers
escaped because a drop of semen found on the woman's sock never
matched any of the boys' DNA. After Reyes' stunning admission,
authorities using improved DNA matching technology linked him to that
sample. But police do not believe that this necessarily exonerates
the five youths.</TE>
<TE>   "While some of the individuals attempted to minimize their
participation, each and every one acknowledged some degree of
culpability" on the tapes, said Robert Castelli, a professor at John
Jay College of Criminal Law and a former investigator for the New
York State Police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible both groups [the defendants and Reyes] are telling
the truth," he added. "That is, the group initiated the crime, raped
the woman and departed the scene, without seeing Reyes, and then he
came along."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sheehan, a New York detective who handled the volatile case
and is now a local TV reporter, angrily disputed the notion that
savvy cops had tricked scared, impressionable youths into a
confession that night.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the coercion?" he asked, noting that police and district
attorneys were scrupulous in their interrogations, well within the
law. And others question whether Reyes, who was convicted of the rape
and murder of a pregnant woman two months after the jogger attack,
can be believed. The serial rapist, who said he came forward after a
religious awakening in prison, offered a meticulous description of
the jogger attack to investigators and also during an interview on
ABC's "Prime Time Live."</TE>
<TE>   "It still hasn't been proved that this guy acted alone, and much
of the case turns on this," said Tim Sullivan, author of "Unequal
Verdicts: The Central Park Jogger Trials." "How credible is his
comment? Just because he has said something doesn't automatically
mean that it has to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, several experts who have examined Reyes have described him
as a psychopath who manipulates people and routinely twists the
truth. Morgenthau has said his office has interviewed the confessed
attacker several times, trying to determine if his account can be
believed.</TE>
<TE>   But the mere mention of these doubts has infuriated the attorneys
and prominent black leaders rallying to defend Kharey Wise, Yusef
Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Antron McCray. All have
completed their sentences but are haunted by a stigma of rape,
defenders say.</TE>
<TE>   "My 16-year-old son was taken from me," said Deloris Wise at a
City Hall rally this month, shaking with rage as she talked about
Kharey Wise, now 30.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't go to a juvenile place, he went to Attica state prison,
and things happen there," she added. "And I can only say to all of
the [law enforcement officials] who did this lying, horrible, hideous
thing to me: I pray for you. I'm not even angry with you. I feel
sorry for you."</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke, Wise was flanked by a coalition of more than 50
politicians and religious leaders, all demanding that Morgenthau
quickly move to overturn the convictions. They derided the idea that
he might dismiss the whole case on a technicality, namely that police
failed to inform attorneys in 1989 that another rape -- to which
Reyes also has confessed -- took place two days before the jogger
attack, and in the same general area of the park.</TE>
<TE>   "The sword of justice fell on the wrong people, the wrong people
went to jail, and these young men lost precious years," said the Rev.
Clarence Grant, head of the New York Faith-Based Coalition. "This
case is still an open wound in our community, and we need exoneration
now for real closure."</TE>
<TE>   Just how Morgenthau will resolve this tricky dilemma is a matter
of intense speculation. The veteran prosecutor has said little,
except that he will probe all leads in searching for the truth. Yet
much of his investigation, apart from Reyes' veracity, must focus on
the confessions.</TE>
<TE>   The grainy videotapes, made a day after the attack, offer
convincing proof to some experts of the boys' guilt. Although the
suspects told somewhat different versions of the attack, and none
admitted raping the jogger, they all confirmed one another's presence
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "We all took turns getting on top of her," McCray said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first rape," Wise said in one statement, who admitted
to having witnessed the crime without participating in it.</TE>
<TE>   Santana, in his videotaped statement, recalled that "she was just
hollering, like 'Help! Help!' "</TE>
<TE>   Two juries in separate trials -- torn between the lack of physical
evidence and the incriminating statements -- took 10 to 12 days to
convict the youths. Now, at least one former juror, Harold Brueland,
says he believes the convictions were wrong, in part because of
Reyes' admission. Others also voice doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming to believe there was a terrible miscarriage of justice
here," said Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York
University. "We know innocent people get convicted; that's not new,
and I think these kids were less able to defend themselves than
middle-class teenagers caught in the same vise might have been able
to do that night."</TE>
<TE>   Like other critics, Gillers suggests that the boys were probably
exhausted by a long night of tough police interrogations. Although
they had their parents with them during the videotaping sessions, he
noted that adults might have been equally overwhelmed by the
authorities at that moment.</TE>
<TE>   "The question we ask ourselves is, would we confess to something
if we knew we were innocent?" he asked. "The answer is no, we think
we'd pound the table and protest our innocence. But the challenge for
a juror, and it is herculean, is to see how innocent people could be
pressured."</TE>
<TE>   The laws regulating confessions gives police wide latitude. They
may lie, trick, cajole, posture and otherwise manipulate people into
making statements, experts say. But they cannot use tactics that
would bully an innocent person into confessing. An example, Sullivan
said, would be a detective threatening to kill a suspect's parent
unless he confess.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the Central Park jogger controversy has sparked
demands from the New York Civil Liberties Union and other watchdog
groups that police videotape all interactions between police and
suspects, long before a confession is extracted. That way, critics
suggest, there will be a more complete visual record of how someone
volunteers information.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the mystery of what really happened that April night at
police headquarters -- and in a Central Park ravine -- continues to
haunt New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The full truth may never be known," said O'Donald of John Jay
College. "And that's the terrible thing here."</TE>

<HD>A Cancer in the Body Politic: 41 Million Uninsured
Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not easy to make 41 million people disappear. But that's exactly
what's happening in the campaign for Congress this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The missing are the 41 million -- 41.2 million, to be precise --
Americans who don't have health insurance, according to the latest
Census Bureau figures. That's more than one-seventh of the
population. If the uninsured all lived in one place, it would become
the largest state in the union, as populous as California and
Massachusetts combined.</LD>
<LD>   Yet you would never know it from listening to the candidates on
the stump this fall, much less from watching their ads. The uninsured
are the great unmentioned of the 2002 campaign: an enormous social
problem and vast human tragedy that both parties are doing their best
to utterly and unconditionally ignore.</LD>
<TE>   But Congress (and President Bush) can't avert their eyes forever.
After dropping through the economic boom of the late 1990s, the
number of Americans without health insurance is rising again -- and
is virtually guaranteed to rise even faster in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the health-care system may be facing its greatest strain
since the sharp deterioration in coverage a decade ago that prompted
President Clinton's failed crusade to guarantee all Americans access
to care. ''There is going to have to be significant action,'' says
Kate Sullivan, director of health-care policy at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions for a health-care train wreck are assembling from
three directions.</TE>
<TE>   First is a crisis in costs. In the early 1990s, when the number of
Americans without coverage rose sharply, one of the principal
culprits was a dramatic rise in insurance costs. Then, as the
managed-care revolution forced reductions in spending, premium
increases moderated significantly through the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, costs are spiking again. Employer premiums for
health insurance jumped 12.7% last year (with exploding prescription
drug prices a major factor), according to a recent survey by the
Kaiser Family Foundation. That was the second consecutive year of
double-digit increases.</TE>
<TE>   The inevitable result is that fewer employers, especially small
employers, are offering coverage to their workers: The percentage of
firms with 200 or fewer employees who offered coverage dropped from
67% in 2000 to 61% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Employers also are passing on more of the rising cost to workers.
The average monthly worker contribution for a family policy has
jumped from $138 in 2000 to $174 this year. Over time, higher costs
will mean fewer low-wage workers can afford coverage, even when their
employer offers it.</TE>
<TE>   The second factor eroding coverage is the economic slowdown. The
average unemployment rate has been much higher in 2002 (5.9%) than it
was in 2001 (4.8%). That means more Americans are losing coverage on
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the cost and employment trends have taken a bite
out of the number of Americans who receive health care through their
work. The census figures released late last month showed that the
number of Americans with job-related health coverage dropped by about
1.3 million in 2001; a recent federal survey found that the losses in
employer-provided coverage continued through early this year.</TE>
<TE>   The bright spot in this picture has been that government programs
have been catching more of those falling through the holes in the
private system. But the prognosis for publicly provided coverage, the
third factor in the equation, is looking gloomy too.</TE>
<TE>   The best news in health care in recent years was the agreement
between Clinton and the Republican-led Congress in 1997 to create the
Children's Health Insurance Program, a federal-state partnership to
cover children of the working poor. Largely because of CHIP,
government programs cover about 5 million more Americans than in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   But now, even as private coverage recedes, public programs are
being weakened. With state budgets squeezed by the recession (and
exorbitant tax cuts in the late 1990s), 18 states are planning
cutbacks in eligibility for Medicaid, which serves the poorest
families.</TE>
<TE>   Some states also are trimming CHIP. But the biggest threat facing
the program is a complex dispute over how to reallocate federal funds
from states that aren't spending them fast enough to those (such as
New York and Maryland) whose allotments aren't big enough to sustain
their programs. If Washington can't untangle the knot, the
administration projects that enrollment in CHIP will fall by nearly 1
million kids through 2006 -- even as the reduced availability of
private coverage will increase the need.</TE>
<TE>   Search high and low and you still won't hear a peep about any of
this in most states this fall. Unfortunately, the main exception to
this silence may set back the cause of expanding coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates placed on the ballot in Oregon an initiative to
establish a public system of guaranteed coverage for everyone in the
state. But its huge price tag ($12 billion in annual new taxes)
virtually guarantees its defeat next month.</TE>
<TE>   That likely failure should reinforce the message of the Clinton
debacle: The best path to progress is incremental change that ensures
maximum stability for the 240 million Americans who have coverage.
Washington should start by preventing further erosion in the public
safety net.</TE>
<TE>   That requires two steps. One is to temporarily provide states more
federal money to bolster their Medicaid programs; the Senate approved
such a plan last summer, but it's stalled in the House. The other is
to provide new rules for ensuring that CHIP funds are allocated to
the states that need them most, as a Senate coalition led by Sen.
John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) has proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the path gets murky. The most promising idea for
expanding coverage in recent years has been extending CHIP to working
poor adults. But that model looks less attractive now because it
requires a matching contribution from the states -- and most don't
have the cash. And any plan to expand coverage will have to find new
ways to restrain costs, particularly for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with these challenges, the men and women running for
Congress are behaving like patients hoping a lump will go away if
they just ignore it. But patients learn, often painfully, that in
health care, delay almost always deepens the danger. The politicians
may soon learn the same thing.</TE>

<HD>Evangelicals Mix Church and Jewish State</HD>
<DH>Prominent American Christian conservatives lead a
nationwide prayer campaign in support of Israel. The push could help
GOP at the polls.</DH>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Along with the soaring hymns and shouted hosannas, Sunday services at
Mount Paran Church of God carried a sobering whiff of geopolitics.</LD>
<LD>   The 700 or so parishioners attending morning services at the
church on the outskirts of Atlanta were asked to pray for Israel --
part of a nationwide effort among an estimated 16,000 churches to
signal Christian backing for the violence-plagued Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   "The past two years of conflict unfortunately have reminded us
that not only is there not peace in Jerusalem, but the very existence
of Israel is being threatened by its adversaries," Shmuel Ben-Shmuel,
Israel's consul general in Atlanta, told the congregation. Israeli
diplomats also were scheduled to appear at church services in San
Antonio and Bakersfield, where an afternoon rally involving 16
churches was planned.</LD>
<TE>   The one-day prayer campaign was the latest in a series of
high-profile events by evangelical Christians in support of Israel in
recent months -- a show of solidarity that has gratified many
American Jews but left others uneasy with what they see as an
unlikely marriage of convenience.</TE>
<TE>   The day of prayer, sponsored by a group called Stand for Israel,
and similar events have brought together representatives of the
Israeli government and some of the biggest names in the evangelical
Christian world. A co-chairman of Stand for Israel is Ralph Reed, who
formerly headed the Christian Coalition and now is an Atlanta-based
political consultant and chairman of the Georgia Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said Sunday's event was expected to include as many as
5 million parishioners from churches, many of them in the South,
representing varied denominations. They said the nationwide campaign
highlighted a long-standing theological bond with Israel among
conservative Christians -- rooted in the Bible and dating to the
Jewish state's creation in 1948 -- that has grown stronger since the
Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and  recent months of violence in the
Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening is, a constituency that has always been
nominally pro-Israel has since Sept. 11, and certainly against the
backdrop of the intifada, taken that support and turned it into a
truly mobilized nationwide effort," Reed said in an interview. "That
is definitely a new development."</TE>
<TE>   The support of conservative Christians, a key segment of the
Republican Party, lends Israel-backers extra clout among GOP leaders
and the Bush administration. At the same time, the visible
expressions of support by Christians may help the GOP make inroads
with Jewish voters, who as a group tend to tilt heavily Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ralph Reed is working on it, I have no doubt that there's an
electoral angle," said Bill Buck, a spokesman for the Democratic
National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a recent survey, Stand for Israel said that U.S. Jews were
warming to President Bush due to his handling of the war on terrorism
-- 81% of respondents viewed him as a strong backer of Israel. Such a
trend "could have an impact" on the next two election cycles, the
group said, although Democratic activists give Republicans little
chance of prying away Jewish votes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not why we're doing what we're doing," Reed said. "We're
doing what we're doing because Israel is in real crisis right now."</TE>
<TE>   Reed was in the first row at Mount Paran as regular services were
interrupted for remarks by Yechiel Eckstein, a rabbi who heads the
International Fellowship of Christians and Jews and is co-chairman of
Stand for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In a message of thanks sprinkled with Hebrew, Eckstein said
Christians' support for Israel was gratifying to Jews. "After 2,000
years of alienation and separation, who would have imagined that I, a
rabbi, would be here in a church in Atlanta?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Shmuel warned congregants that Israel -- the birthplace of
both Judaism and Christianity -- and the United States face a common
threat. "The vicious and brutal attacks on men, women and children in
America and Israel demonstrate that the war waged on us is not just a
war against the Jews and Israel, but a war against the entire Western
civilization," he said. The diplomat was greeted by long and hearty
applause from the suburban congregation.</TE>
<TE>   While key U.S. Jewish leaders have embraced the new closeness with
conservative Christians during a time of trouble for Israel, many
liberal Jews are wary of allying themselves with a group that, for
the most part, holds divergent political views from their own on many
domestic issues -- from gay rights and abortion to the separation of
church and state. Some Jewish commentators have recoiled at making
common cause with such figures of the Christian right as evangelist
Pat Robertson (who recently announced a separate mass-prayer campaign
and fund-raising effort among Christians on behalf of Israel) and the
Rev. Jerry Falwell.</TE>
<TE>   But Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League, has sought to persuade wary American Jews that welcoming
Christian support on Israel does not mean papering over key
differences on social issues at home.</TE>
<TE>   "At no point have we heard them place any conditions on their
support. There is no quid pro quo," Foxman said in a statement posted
on the group's Web site. "At no point have we had to choose between
our fundamental principals concerning the role of religion in America
and our appreciation for their standing with Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Those comments have not extinguished the mixed feelings within the
U.S. Jewish community, which also has shown ambivalence over the
Israeli government's hawkish stance toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Many in the community believe we're in crisis mode. For the
evangelical community to step up at a time when Israel is in need is
a godsend," said Deborah Lauter, the ADL's Southeastern regional
director in Atlanta. "On the other end of the spectrum are those who
say, 'How can we get in bed with the evangelicals when their domestic
agenda is so at odds with our agenda?' "</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Lauter said, there may be one indisputable gain: "It
does promote dialogue with a group that we normally don't dialogue
with," she said.</TE>

<HD>Seesaw Races Grip the Senate</HD>
<DH>Of 34 seats on ballots this fall, the GOP is defending 20;
the Democrats, 14. A handful may decide control of the chamber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democrats and Republicans are racing toward another photo finish in
the struggle for control of the U.S. Senate, as large national themes
and distinctive local concerns have combined to produce virtual
dead-heat races from New Hampshire to Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   As the Nov. 5 elections near, the latest trends in the most
closely watched contests have raised Democrats' hopes of maintaining
their tenuous one-seat Senate majority. But so many races are so
evenly divided, and the underlying national environment remains so
unsettled, that neither side can predict the outcome with any
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   In the seven races considered the most competitive, five remain
too close to call: Republican-held seats in Colorado and New
Hampshire, and Democrat-held seats in Missouri, Minnesota and South
Dakota. Democrats are slightly favored to hold on to a seat in New
Jersey and capture a GOP seat in Arkansas.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans need a net gain of only one seat to win control of the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   With so many races so tight, small changes in the national
environment could loom large. Over the last six weeks, Republicans
benefited from an increased focus on national security issues
generated by the debate over a possible war with Iraq. But that
advantage may have peaked too soon.</TE>
<TE>   Even some GOP strategists worry that the campaign focus over the
final two weeks may revert toward the economy -- and trigger the
traditional voter inclination to punish the party holding the White
House for hard times. "It would be better if the election was this
Tuesday," one top GOP strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the economy stands as the major threat to the GOP,
offsetting factors are fueling Republican hopes of avoiding the
Senate losses typical for the president's party in midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Geography is benefiting the GOP: Five of the seven races
considered the most competitive are in states President Bush carried
in 2000. Almost all of them are culturally conservative states where
the national security arguments Republicans are stressing
traditionally carry the most weight. And, despite the gloom about the
economy, Democrats have failed to establish a consistent advantage in
polls as the party better able to revive prosperity -- partly because
so few Democratic candidates have offered a clear agenda for
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not a slam-dunk for Democrats," Republican
pollster Whit Ayres said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, voters are selecting senators in 34 states this fall;
Republicans are defending 20 seats, Democrats 14. The chamber is now
divided among 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans and one independent.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the seven fiercely competitive races, Georgia also is being
watched. Democrats remain confident about first-term Sen. Max
Cleland, but Republicans believe Rep. Saxby Chambliss is gaining.</TE>
<TE>   There are half a dozen more races where both sides are still
within reach, but the party holding the seat has a clear advantage.
These are open seats now held by retiring Republican incumbents in
North and South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, and contests featuring
Democratic incumbents Tom Harkin in Iowa and Mary Landrieu in
Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining seats seem safe for the party holding them.</TE>
<TE>   The national backdrop for these contests is ambiguous and
contradictory. On the one hand, Bush continues to enjoy stratospheric
approval ratings; historically, when the president is so popular, his
party benefits in midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the public is displaying a level of anxiety
about the economy and the country's direction that usually signals
trouble in congressional races for the party holding the White House.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup Organization Inc. survey,
nearly three-fourths of Americans described the economy as poor or
only fair. That was the bleakest assessment since October 1994 --
just before the Democrats suffered a landslide repudiation that swept
control of the House and the Senate to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   No one on either side is predicting such a massive shift. The
safest prediction is that the majority in the Senate will remain
tenuous after November, with the majority party still holding only a
narrow advantage.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, candidates from both parties have been cautious
in developing their message and agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have been aggressive on two fronts: defending Bush's
2001 tax cut and challenging Democrats on issues revolving around
national security. GOP nominees as diverse as Jim Talent in Missouri,
Norm Coleman in Minnesota, Doug Forrester in New Jersey, John Cornyn
in Texas, John R. Thune in South Dakota and Chambliss in Georgia are
all trying to paint their Democratic opponents as soft on defense.</TE>
<TE>   But on several issues, the Republicans have been unusually
defensive. Most have tried to convince voters that they are just as
eager to provide senior citizens with subsidies for prescription
drugs as are Democrats. And with the notable exception of Lindsey O.
Graham in South Carolina, almost all of the GOP candidates have tried
to downplay their support for Bush's proposal to allow workers to
divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes into individual
accounts they could invest in stocks and bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Democrats have been campaigning from even more of a
defensive crouch, especially in the states that Bush carried in 2000.
Except for Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, all of the party's
candidates in the most competitive races supported Bush's request for
congressional authority to pursue military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   And, with exceptions such as Wellstone and Erskine Bowles in North
Carolina, almost all Democratic challengers and incumbents in close
races have indicated support for Bush's tax cut -- which party
leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota
have blamed for the resurgence of the federal deficit and linked to
the economy's sputtering performance.</TE>
<TE>   This embrace of Bush has made it tougher for Republicans to paint
Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals. But some Democratic strategists
fret that support for the tax cut also has made it tougher for
Democrats to effectively critique Bush's economic record or develop a
coherent alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Republicans take heart in the Democrats' inability to
establish any clear lead in polling on the economy. "What you've got
is people who have confidence in the president's leadership and they
are not blaming this president, or even Republicans, for where the
economy is," said Kenneth Mehlman, White House director of political
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Without a clear message on broad economic policy, Democratic
candidates are focusing on more narrowly targeted issues. From
liberals to centrists, the Democrats are pledging to oppose private
accounts under Social Security, create a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare and develop new protections for private pensions; some
also say they'll push to increase the minimum wage or provide tax
breaks to make college more affordable.</TE>
<TE>   The main message from Democrats in the closing days "will be that
we know these are tight times and we have something real to offer you
and your family in terms of financial security," said Jim Jordan,
executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond all these calculations, most races also are being affected
by specific local factors. These range from a heated debate over the
federal response to a brutal drought in South Dakota, to controversy
over Wellstone's renouncing an earlier pledge to serve two terms, and
the lingering controversy in New Jersey over Democratic Sen. Robert
Torricelli's abrupt withdrawal from the race.</TE>
<TE>   Though other upsets could occur, here's a snapshot look at the
seven races both sides believe are most likely to determine Senate
control. They are ranked in the order of likelihood that the seats
may change hands.</TE>
<TE>   ARKANSAS: Battered by negative publicity about his divorce and
remarriage to a former aide, Republican Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a social
conservative elected in 1996, is considered the incumbent most likely
to lose his seat. Democratic Atty. Gen. Mark Pryor has portrayed
himself as a centrist and populist, mixing promises to reach across
party lines with pledges to confront pharmaceutical companies and
increase education funding.</TE>
<TE>   NEW HAMPSHIRE: Republicans thought the seat had moved safely into
their column when Rep. John E. Sununu beat quirky incumbent Sen. Bob
Smith in a primary last month. But the Democratic nominee, Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen, has caught -- and, in some surveys, passed -- Sununu
with a populist message that has attacked him for supporting private
accounts under Social Security and accused him of cozying up to
corporate tax cheats.</TE>
<TE>   MISSOURI: Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan was appointed to the seat
after her husband, Mel, died in a plane crash just before the 2000
vote and still won more votes than the then-GOP incumbent, John
Ashcroft. But she's getting all she can handle from Talent. The two
seem to be battling to a draw on issues; the key may be whether
Carnahan can convincingly rebut charges she's not up to the job.</TE>
<TE>   SOUTH DAKOTA: Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson and Thune have engaged
in the heavyweight title fight of the election year -- a 15-round
struggle with relentless charges and countercharges from the
candidates, heavy advertising by outside groups and inescapable
national overtones. (At times it has seemed a proxy war between Bush
and Daschle.) Democrats are optimistic about their turnout efforts,
but this state leans strongly toward Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   MINNESOTA: Democrats remain cautiously optimistic about
Wellstone's chances. But Republican Coleman, a former Democrat, was
making inroads by questioning Wellstone's defense record, even before
the incumbent voted against the use of force in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   COLORADO: Sen. Wayne Allard hasn't established much of a public
identity in his first term. In polls over the last two years, he has
almost always attracted less than 45% support -- an ominous sign for
an incumbent. The state's GOP inclination could still carry him past
Democrat Tom Strickland, whom Allard beat in 1996. But "Republicans
are as nervous as can be," Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli said.</TE>
<TE>   NEW JERSEY: Forrester had surged into the lead amid revulsion over
Torricelli's ethics problems. But when Torricelli withdrew in favor
of former Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, Forrester lost his principal
argument. Lautenberg quickly went ahead in most surveys by portraying
Forrester as too conservative for the state. The bad taste left by
Torricelli's departure has kept Forrester close, but the state's
strong Democratic lean is tilting the race toward Lautenberg.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Has a Message for Police</HD>
<DH>Authorities say the killer left a phone number, and they
announce, 'call us.' The man shot outside a restaurant clings to
life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun and Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ASHLAND, Va.</DL>
<LD>Police made a cryptic public appeal Sunday night to the rifle-toting
sniper who has terrorized Washington's suburbs after a telephone
number and message were found at the scene of a weekend shooting in
rural Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   "To the person who left us a message at the Ponderosa last night,"
Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose read from a
prepared statement, "you gave us a telephone number. We do want to
talk to you. Call us at the number you provided." Then Moose turned
his back on reporters and withdrew without answering questions.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators believe the message was left by the sniper, and the
chief's words were intended as a direct response to the gunman, an
official familiar with the investigation said.</LD>
<TE>   The Saturday night attack outside a Ponderosa steakhouse here left
a 37-year-old man clinging to life with a bullet in his belly. Law
enforcement officials quickly acknowledged that the unidentified man
was probably the latest victim of the unknown gunman. Late into the
night and throughout the day Sunday, hundreds of weary investigators
continued to hunt through the thick woods on the hem of Interstate 95
here, desperate for clues in the one-shot assaults that appear to
have spread from the Maryland suburbs deep into the rural farmland of
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Moose's statement was the first hint that new evidence has turned
up in the ongoing hunt for the sniper -- and also was the first time
that police openly have reached out through the media to communicate
with the gunman. "I would like for the media to carry this point,
carry it clearly and carry it often," Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   In the anxious days since a bullet punched through the front
window of a Maryland craft shop Oct. 2, nine people have died and two
more have been wounded by the sniper. Over the weeks, a sort of
public tug of war has unfurled involving the elusive sniper, the
investigators on his trail and the journalists covering the pursuit.
This is a tricky game for police, who depend on tips from an informed
public -- but struggle against information leaks that show their hand
or, worse, spur the sniper to attack.</TE>
<TE>   When news reports assured parents that schools were still safe,
the sniper gunned down a 13-year-old in front of a middle school.
When observers noted publicly that nobody had been shot at night, the
sniper waited until after sundown to attack. After the school
shooting, police found the death card of a fortune teller's Tarot
deck with a note scrawled on its face: "Dear policeman, I am God."</TE>
<TE>   "This guy, these guys or this guy and his girl are interactive
terrorists," former FBI profiler Clinton Van Zandt told Associated
Press. "They are interacting with law enforcement through the media."</TE>
<TE>   If the sniper is responsible for the Saturday attack, he is
branching out from the ring of suburbs that were his customary
hunting ground. It will also mark the first time he has struck on a
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The victim has undergone two surgeries, and late Sunday doctors
removed the bullet that could provide a ballistic link to the sniper.
But batteries of agents from the sniper task force already had
questioned witnesses and combed the woods behind the parking lot
where the diner was shot at his wife's side.</TE>
<TE>   "We are acting as if it is [another sniper shooting] and we will
continue in that mode until we find out it is not," said Col. V.
Stuart Cook of the Hanover County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   All the earmarks were there: One bullet. A parking lot near the
highway. An unseen gunman who opened fire -- and disappeared. This
time, the target was an out-of-state traveler who had pulled off the
interstate to refuel his car and sit down for dinner. Fed and rested,
he and his wife were headed for the car when the shot rang out.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gwathmey, 45, was staying the night at a nearby motel. He
was outside smoking a cigarette when he was startled by a loud noise
from the direction of the Ponderosa, "like the sound you hear when
one of those big Dumpsters drops," he said. Minutes later, the wail
of sirens filled the night, and Gwathmey watched police maneuver
large tractor-trailer rigs onto the I-95 ramp to block cars from
reaching the highway. "I've never seen this many cop cars in my
life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A sharp boom is a common characteristic of guns that fire the
.223-caliber rounds favored by the killer, firearms experts said.
"The sound is relatively loud, even though the recoil from the gun is
pretty minimal," said Jim Pasco, a former federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms deputy director who is executive director of the
National Fraternal Order of Police.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the man collapsed on the blacktop, police and
sheriff's deputies plunged into the dense stand of maples, pines and
green birch that rises behind the restaurant's parking lot. Within
two hours, they were joined by ATF agents and dogs sensitive to trace
amounts of gunpowder.</TE>
<TE>   The forest is a tangle of trees and trails cut by a wide brook.
Beyond the tree line, workers have cleared a wide swath of trees to
make way for a Wal-Mart Supercenter.</TE>
<TE>   A plan to shut down all the major nearby highways went into effect
10 minutes after the shooting, city of Ashland spokesman Jim Perdue
said. But residents said anybody familiar with the turf could make
his way back to the highway in five minutes or less. "It wouldn't be
that hard to get away," said Greg Puryear, who works in a filling
station across the road from the eatery. "You wouldn't know it by
looking from here, but you could do it."</TE>
<TE>   Light rain fell on and off all night Saturday, and Hanover County
Sheriff's Lt. Doug Goodman said investigators planned to inspect a
muddy field beyond the tree line for tire tracks and footprints.
"Even if it's a tire impression, it might show up on the muddy road,"
he said. As Sunday dragged on, investigators slashed down yellow tape
and withdrew from the woods and parking lots, but a police line still
roped off the fields.</TE>
<TE>   Sniper attacks seemed an improbable worry in this bucolic town of
Victorian houses and aged oaks, a place that has dubbed itself "the
center of the universe" and prides itself on neighbors being able to
leave their front doors unlocked. With a single gunshot, Washington's
woes have spread down I-95 into the rolling forests, soybean farms
and tomato fields that mark the beginning of the South.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in Ashland has been murdered since February. When suburban
Washington schools scouted for playing fields out of the sniper's
reach, they chose Ashland as a host town for displaced matches.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't even speed here, because they say the police would
write their own grandmothers a ticket," said Brenda Harring, a
36-year-old resident who snapped souvenir photographs of
investigators Sunday. "To see this in Ashland -- this just feels
surreal."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, worried residents clumped across the street from the
steakhouse, talking quietly and shaking their heads. Mayor Angela
LaCombe drove back to town from Norfolk, Va., in such a panic that
she crashed her van into a parking garage pillar.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of like Mayberry," said Vice Mayor Faye Prichard,
referring to the setting of the folksy TV sitcom that starred Andy
Griffith.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, detectives swept through the motels along England Road,
rousing potential witnesses from their beds. Gwathmey said detectives
asked him whether he had noticed any suspicious guests in the motel.
They also wanted to know whether he had seen a white box truck or a
white van -- vehicles that police have sought in connection with the
slayings. "I see them on the road everywhere," Gwathmey said, "but
there weren't any parked around here."</TE>
<TE>   The wounded man endured three hours of surgery Saturday night at
the Medical College of Virginia Hospital in Richmond to stanch heavy
internal bleeding. Doctors had to remove part of the man's stomach,
along with half of his pancreas and his spleen. He underwent a second
operation late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The prognosis is still guarded," said Dr. Rao Ivatury, the
hospital's director of trauma and critical care. "But since he is a
very healthy man and he is very young, the chances are fair to good,
I would say."</TE>

<LD>A look at some classic moments in World Series Game 2 history:</LD>
<LD>   1959 -- With the Dodgers trailing, 2-1, in the seventh inning,
pinch-hitter Chuck Essegian hit a tying home run to left, Jim Gilliam
walked and Charlie Neal, who had hit a bases-empty homer in the
fifth, followed with a two-run homer to center, propelling L.A. to a
4-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   1978 -- Ron Cey drove in all four Dodger runs in a 4-3 victory
over the Yankees with an RBI single and a three-run homer, and Bob
Welch, pitching in relief, struck out Reggie Jackson on a 3-2 pitch
for the final out after an epic battle.</LD>
<TE>   1986 -- The Boston Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the World Series
with 9-3 rout of the New York Mets. The Red Sox had 18 hits and
battered Dwight Gooden for six runs in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   1991 -- A game won by Minnesota, 3-2, on rookie Scott Leius'
tiebreaking homer in the eighth inning might best be remembered for a
play at first base in the third inning, when Twin first baseman Kent
Hrbek took a pickoff throw and appeared to lift Atlanta's Ron Gant
off the bag. Umpire Drew Coble ruled Gant's momentum carried him off
the bag and called him out.</TE>

<HD>One of Greatest Has a Special Bond With Barry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was easy to recognize Willie Mays from behind because he has
the most famous back in sports history.</LD>
<LD>   How many times have we seen that back, with the number 24 stitched
across it, running toward the center-field wall to haul in Vic
Wertz's drive in the 1954 World Series? You can't miss it these days
with that ad to choose the greatest World Series moment running
between innings.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't a bad World Series moment itself: rounding a corner in
the tunnel by the Giants' clubhouse and running smack into an
impromptu news conference with Mays, who was surrounded by a cluster
of reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Mays was there to talk to his godson -- kid by the name of Barry
Bonds -- but he wound up spending more time with reporters. Bonds
popped out of the clubhouse midway through and playfully tried to
pull Mays away from the throng.</TE>
<TE>   "You show up and cause havoc around here," Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Mays brought a sense of order and perspective. Who
better to talk about the greatness of Bonds than one of the greatest
to play the game -- and one of only three men to hit more home runs
than Bonds?</TE>
<TE>   If there was a theme, it was the overwhelming importance of the
World Series. It shifts perceptions and forges reputations.</TE>
<TE>   To Mays, Bonds' entry in the 2002 World Series caps his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he did everything he possibly could do in baseball," Mays
said. "If he wins, that's a little more icing on the cake for him.
Now he can say to me, 'I won, you won.'</TE>
<TE>   Lately Mays has worn his '54 World Series ring on his left pinky
finger. It's a simple little gold thing, very understated by today's
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "I started wearing it this year, to remind him," Mays said. "He
wants one. He wants this."</TE>
<TE>   If Bonds can't get one of his own, he should just be patient.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably will it to him some kind of way," Mays said.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bonds wins this thing: "That would put him right up there
with me," Mays said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't come right out and say it, but it was pretty clear that
Mays considers himself the standard for baseball greatness. ("I think
I did everything," he said. "What didn't I do?")</TE>
<TE>   He sounded willing to step off the podium for Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If they say he's No. 1, that's fine," Mays said. "Maybe I'll
still be two. It was Babe Ruth before. Who cares? As long as he
enjoys himself."</TE>
<TE>   With 613 home runs, Bonds could pass Mays' mark of 660 and move
into third place on the all-time list as soon as next season.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt like he didn't want to do it," Mays said. "I said, 'Hey,
you've got to do what you've got to do. I'm sure he'll pass me. No
big deal. It doesn't change nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Watching Bonds be happy makes Mays happy.</TE>
<TE>   "To have him start smiling again and enjoying baseball I think
that's what I'm all about," Mays said. "He's just beginning to
realize that it's a game. But you can get a lot out of the game. He's
beginning to understand that a lot more than say, five or 10 years
ago."</TE>
<TE>   Mays doesn't think it's necessary to show your teeth to
demonstrate that the game is enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   "I never smiled when I played ball," he said. "I wasn't out there
to smile. When you smile, you don't have time to worry about your
opponents."</TE>
<TE>   He was all smiles Sunday however, because he's enjoying his
godson's first trip to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm more excited for him, because now, what else are they
going to say about him?" Mays said. "He's a great ballplayer."</TE>
<TE>   Greatness is usually defined in October.</TE>
<TE>   That was the one deficiency in Bonds' career (a .196 postseason
batting average and one home run before this year). But this year he
has six home runs, including one in his first World Series at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Mays said the play he made on Wertz's drive wasn't his best catch.
He knows why it's his most famous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the World Series," he said. "What did he do in the World
Series?"</TE>
<TE>   Mays said his most memorable World Series moment was Mookie
Wilson's ground ball that went between Bill Buckner's legs in 1986.
It stuck with him because he knew that just as the World Series
creates heroes it is especially cruel to those who falter.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Oh my God, they're going to kill him,' " Mays said. "I
knew right away he was never going to live it down."</TE>
<TE>   It's the World Series. Everything's bigger. Willie Mays at the
ballpark? Cool, but it's nothing that doesn't happen 25 times or so a
year at Pacific Bell Park. Willie Mays at the World Series? News,
even if he watched the game in the Giants' clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't there for face time, he was just a guy who wanted to
pass along some advice to his godson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to me to let him know that I'm here, to know that
whatever he does I'm watching," Mays said. "Whatever he does wrong,
we talk."</TE>
<TE>   To the Giants it might not be too big a deal to have this legend
walk through their clubhouse. As Kenny Lofton said, they quickly get
used to it.</TE>
<TE>   But even Bonds, who can be blase about so many things, recognizes
how special it is to have greatness in his inner circle. For years he
has talked about getting a painting made showing him in left field,
Mays in center and Barry's father, Bobby, in right field.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would run that outfield?" former Angel great Don Baylor said
when the idea was presented to him? "Mays."</TE>

<HD>Anderson Held Up by Coach, Not Leg</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After Saturday's Game 1, when asked why Garret Anderson did not score
from first base on a two-out double, the first thing Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said was that Anderson was playing with a tight
hamstring and was "not 100%."</LD>
<LD>   Anderson strained his right hamstring while running out an infield
single Sept. 14. He missed the next two games, but he has played
regularly since.</LD>
<LD>   Athletic trainer Ned Bergert said Sunday that Anderson still
receives daily treatment for the injury, and third base coach Ron
Roenicke said Anderson will not be stealing bases anytime soon.</LD>
<TE>   However, Scioscia and Roenicke adamantly denied Sunday that the
injury explained Anderson's inability to score. The ball caromed
directly to right fielder Reggie Sanders, and so Roenicke held
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I held him is because he would have been thrown out at
home, not because I was worried about his leg," Roenicke said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "His hamstring did not hamper him. It's not an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was unaffected by all the fuss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a problem," Anderson said. "It's nothing to write home
about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did not strike out in Game 2 Sunday night, the first
time that has happened in a World Series since the New York Yankees
did it in Game 7 in 1960 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian reporter asked Scioscia about Moose Jaw, the
Saskatchewan hamlet where Shawn Wooten revived his career playing in
an independent league.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been through Moose Jaw," Scioscia said, grinning
widely. "But, if this doesn't pan out here, you never know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of baseball's best stories are told around the batting cage
and Sunday was no exception.</TE>
<TE>   Standing with two of his former players,  Scioscia and Angel
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda
recalled one of his favorite stories about the two.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened down in the Dominican Republic, when Scioscia was
playing down there," Lasorda said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger general manager Al Campanis "was concerned about
Scioscia's weight," Lasorda said, "so he ordered Scioscia to pedal a
certain number of miles a week on an exercise bike."</TE>
<TE>   There was a mileage counter on the bike to keep Scioscia honest.</TE>
<TE>   Or so the Dodgers thought.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Hatcher entered the conversation. He said he was
walking by Scioscia's apartment one day and heard the sound of the
bicycle click-clicking along.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, Scioscia is really working that bike," Hatcher thought.</TE>
<TE>   He turned the doorknob, looked in and a big smile crossed
Hatcher's face.</TE>
<TE>   "There was Scioscia lying on the couch," Hatcher said, "with a
pizza in a box across his chest. And there was this Dominican kid
pedaling away on that bike."</TE>
<TE>   And racking up the miles for the benefit of the Dodgers back home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lasorda said that if Scioscia doesn't win American League
manager-of-the-year honors, "there should be an investigation."</TE>
<TE>   What about Oakland's Art Howe? Some think he deserves the award.</TE>
<TE>   "For what?" Lasorda shot back to a Bay Area reporter who posed the
question. "I like Art Howe, but don't tell me he's done a better job
than this guy here.</TE>
<TE>   "How many games did he make up from last year? Who rebounded from
a tougher start? If you guys don't vote him manager of the year, I'm
gonna find out who voted, and I'm going after them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To pitch or not to pitch to Barry Bonds? That question faces every
opponent of the Giants, and Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman, who
played for the Cubs and Expos from 1967 to '73, knows how his
pitchers are feeling this week.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman, who threw two no-hitters during his brief major league
career, had his own Bonds-like dilemma. He had to face Hank Aaron,
the Braves' slugger who hit 755 home runs, more than any player in
the history of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The joke was, how come everyone else comes to bat four times a
game and he comes to bat eight times a game?" Stoneman said. "You
didn't want to face him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the celebrities in attendance for Game 2 were actors Jim
Belushi, Dylan McDermott, Dennis Quaid, Ray Romano, Rob Reiner, David
Hasselhoff, Michael Vartan, Damon and Marlon Wayans, Kiefer
Sutherland and Arnold Schwarzenegger; Gov. Gray Davis, singer Fred
Durst, tennis star Pete Sampras and Lakers Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox,
Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Samaki Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging around the cage during batting practice were Willie Mays,
George Brett, Ernie Banks and Lasorda, former USC coach Rod Dedeaux
and former National League president Leonard Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted in the Diamond Club: former Dodger manager Bill Russell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports lead analyst Kevin Kennedy is torn because of his ties
to Scioscia, Giant Manager Dusty Baker and members of their coaching
staffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy," said Kennedy, who worked with Scioscia and many
coaches in the Dodger organization. "You've got friends standing on
both sides, so you wish they all could win. I guess that's just
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baker likes the way Angel fans have ratcheted up their enthusiasm
and come to the games dressed in red to support their team.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen this much red since St. Louis, or the old
Cincinnati Reds' stadium," he said. "It is extremely loud. The people
are into it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to communicate to our outfielders. Especially
Benito [Santiago,] he has the catcher's mask on, so I have to wave to
J.T. [Snow] or Rich Aurilia in order to get his attention because he
can't hear me.</TE>
<TE>   "I had [Tsuyoshi] Shinjo bring me one of those megaphones they use
in Japan, those clackers, because it happened once I think someplace
else, Chicago or someplace, he couldn't hear me. So I had the
megaphone, but I didn't think the umpires would go for that too much.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan, it's cool. Over here, I don't know if they're going to
go for that."</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0--Kenny Lofton took a called strike
three, but thought it was ball four and walked toward first. He
should wear a Farmer John patch on his uniform. Rich Aurilia grounded
to short. My 18-month-old has a stronger arm than David Eckstein, but
he gets the job done. The Angels don't win without him. Jeff Kent
grounded to the pitcher, Kevin Appier threw a one-hopper to first,
but Scott Spiezio made a great defensive play, digging the ball out
of the dirt to save an error. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 5, Giants 0--Eckstein singled to right. Darin
Erstad doubled to right-center, Eckstein scored easily. Someone must
have told Erstad to stop swinging for the seats. That was a classic
Erstad hit. Tim Salmon singled to right, Erstad stopping at third.
Garret Anderson singled to right, Erstad scoring, Salmon to second.
Troy Glaus flied to deep center, Salmon taking third. Brad Fullmer
singled to center. Lofton made a nice diving attempt, but couldn't
come up with the ball. Salmon scored, Anderson to third. Spiezio
singled to right, Anderson scoring, Fullmer to third. With Bengie
Molina at the plate, the Angels pulled off a delayed double steal.
Spiezio took off for second, Benito Santiago didn't look the runner
back to third, and when he threw to second, Fullmer basically walked
home. Molina flied to deep right, Spiezio to third. Russ Ortiz threw
a ball that went behind Adam Kennedy, but when he ducked to get out
of the way, the ball hit his bat and he hit an excuse-me grounder.
David Bell threw him out easily in one of the stranger plays you'll
ever see. The Angels were in such a groove this inning that their
bats hit the ball even when they weren't trying. Five runs, six hits,
one left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 5, Giants 4--Joe Buck tells us that a five-run lead
is the "best-case scenario for Kevin Appier." What about a six-run
lead? Is that worse? A seven-run lead? Barry Bonds walked. Santiago
flied to center. J.T. Snow singled to right, Bonds was running on the
pitch and took third. On an 0-and-2 pitch, Reggie Sanders homered to
left. Bell homered to center. Shawon Dunston hit a grounder up the
middle, Kennedy making a nice grab-and-throw to get Dunston, who dove
head-first into the bag. Why do major leaguers do that when all it
does is slow you down? Lofton singled to center. Aurilia took strike
three. Four runs, four hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 7, Giants 4--Eckstein beat out a bunt between the
mound and the third-base line. Erstad flied to center. Salmon homered
just inside the left-field foul pole. Anderson popped to first. Glaus
doubled to center. Chad Zerbe pitching. Glaus took third on a passed
ball. Fullmer grounded to first, pitcher covering. Two runs, three
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 7, Giants 5--Kent homered to left on a breaking
ball that didn't break. Bonds walked on four pitches. John Lackey
pitching. Guess this means he won't be starting Game 4. Santiago
lined to short, Bonds was doubled off first. Smart baserunning.
Eckstein thought there were three outs and ran off the field. Whoops.
Snow flied to center. Lackey restores order. One run, one hit, none
left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 7, Giants 5--It's official, the Mark McGwire
commercial where he pals around with that guy has been played more
often than any commercial in history. Spiezio grounded to second.
Molina grounded to short. Kennedy grounded to the pitcher. No runs,
no hits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 7, Giants 5--Sanders singled to left. With Bell at
the plate, Sanders stole second. Bell grounded to the pitcher,
Sanders stayed at second. Dunston grounded to short, Sanders was
caught in a rundown and tagged by Glaus. Lofton flied to deep
left-center. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 7, Giants 5--Eckstein grounded to short. Erstad
grounded to third. Time for a "Sounds of the Game." Bud Black finally
referred to a pitcher by name. Probably because Lackey's back was to
him so he could see the name on his uniform. Salmon singled to left.
Anderson grounded to second. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 9, Angels 7--Aurilia hit a little blooper that
bounced in front of Erstad, then got past him. It was charitably
called a double. Kent took a called strike three. Bonds was
intentionally walked. Ben Weber pitching. Santiago singled to left,
loading the bases. Snow singled to right, Aurilia and Bonds scoring,
Santiago to third. Sanders struck out swinging. Bell hit a roller up
the middle, Snow beat Kennedy's throw to second, Santiago scored.
Dunston singled to left, Snow scored. Bell took third and Dunston
second on Anderson's bad throw home. The Giants must have kidnapped
the Rally Monkey. Tim McCarver is giving the game to the Giants
already. Which team did he broadcast 20 games for this season? Way to
remain neutral. It's like the days Tom Heinsohn was the color man on
Laker-Celtic games. Dunston grounded to second. Four runs, five hits,
two left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 9, Angels 8--Could these John Hancock commercials
be a little more depressing? If they aren't showing premature babies,
they're showing a wife reminding her husband to buy insurance before
he dies. Thanks a lot. Glaus singled to center. Michael Eisner is
sitting with Gray Davis in the stands. There's something funny about
Gray Davis being at Edison Field. Fullmer singled to shallow center.
Glaus took third when Lofton bobbled the ball. Score it a hit for
Fullmer and an error on Lofton. Glaus was shaken up when he slid on
top of the ball. Judging by where the ball hit him, he should
probably try out for the Vienna Boys Choir today. Spiezio flied to
center, Glaus scoring. Molina grounded into a 5-4-3 double play.
Molina just can't seem to get a key hit in this series. One run, two
hits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 9, Angels 8--Francisco Rodriguez pitching. Aurilia
struck out on three pitches. Kent struck out. Bonds grounded to
first. The crowd loves Rodriguez. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Giants 9--Kennedy grounded to first. Eckstein
grounded to short. Erstad doubled down the right-field line. The Fox
"Fan Cam" is the biggest waste of television time since "The Chevy
Chase Show." Jay Witasick pitching. Salmon walked. Aaron Fultz
pitching. Anderson singled to right, Erstad scoring. Salmon was
caught in a rundown between second and third and tagged out by Bell.
One run, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 9, Giants 9--We came back from commercial and the
count was already 0-and-1 on Santiago. But at least we know what day
"Boston Public" airs. Can someone please get the baseball contract
away from Fox? Santiago struck out. Snow grounded to first. Sanders
struck out swinging. Rodriguez has faced six batters, has four
strikeouts. By the way, the Angels and Giants have both outscored the
Dallas Cowboys today. And there's no Jerry Jones in the dugout, so
it's a win-win situation. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Giants 9--Felix Rodriguez pitching. Glaus popped
to shallow center, Kent making the catch. Fullmer hit a foul into the
stands that was caught by George Brett. Because George Brett really
needs a ball, instead of any of the little kids sitting around him.
He can put it on his mantel next to his batting titles. "That's the
foul ball I caught in Game 2 of the 2002 World Series!" Fullmer
walked. Spiezio flied to deep right-center. Molina flied to right. No
runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 9, Giants 9--Bell popped to short center, Erstad
made the catch. Dunston popped to first. Lofton grounded to the
pitcher. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 11, Giants 9--Kennedy flied to center. Eckstein
singled to right. Erstad flied to left. Salmon homered to left. The
Rally Monkey is alive!!!!! The Edison Field crowd is ecstatic. Tim
Worrell pitching. Anderson popped to short. Two runs, two hits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 11, Giants 10--Alex Ochoa in right. Troy Percival
pitching. Aurilia flied to deep left. Kent flied to left. Bonds
homered to DEEP right. That ball wouldn't have been out of every
park, though. It would have been playable at Yellowstone. Bonds
smugly watched the ball and slowly made his way around the bases. Hey
Barry, look at the scoreboard. Santiago popped to short right,
Kennedy made the catch. One run, one hit, 1-1 Series.</TE>

<KH>GAME 2 AT ANAHEIM ANGELS 11, SAN FRANCISCO 10</KH>
<HD>Lighting Up Edison</HD>
<DH>Salmon's two-run homer in eighth inning electrifies crowd
and ties Series</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was thunder, and there was lightning, and there was indeed
something heavenly about it all.</LD>
<LD>   From the team elder came the thunder. From the wonder child came
the lightning. The first World Series victory in Angel history was
truly divine.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon, the poster child for postseason giddiness, hit two
two-run home runs, including the game-winning shot with two out in
the eighth inning. Francisco Rodriguez, whose talent all but comes
out of a tall tale, delivered three utterly dominant innings to
become the youngest player to win a World Series game, at 20.</LD>
<TE>   As emotions swayed from exhilaration to exhaustion to elation, the
Angels blew leads of 5-0 and 7-4 before outlasting the San Francisco
Giants Sunday, 11-10. The victory tied the best-of-seven series at
one game apiece, sparing the Angels the misfortune of stumbling into
the Giants' ballpark with a 2-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen a game like that?" Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner said in the Angel clubhouse. "That's as good as it gets."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon ignited a celebration throughout Southern California in the
eighth inning. With David Eckstein on first and two out, and with the
score tied, 9-9, Salmon crushed a 97-mph fastball from Felix
Rodriguez well over the left-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon pumped his fist as he rounded first base, almost leaped
onto home plate, then rushed the dugout and pounded his fists -- hard
-- against those of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a mosh pit," Salmon said. "I wanted to go over there
and crush everybody."</TE>
<TE>   No active player had waited longer to play in October than Salmon,
who made his major league debut with the Angels in 1992. No player
could possibly enjoy it more.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole playoffs, he's looked like he was 12 years old," center
fielder Darin Erstad said. "After he hit that one, he looked like he
was eight.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be happier for him. He's gotten the opportunity to get
to the postseason, and he's making the most of it."</TE>
<TE>   So is Rodriguez, who also looks as if he is 12. After the Giants
battered three Angel pitchers for nine runs in the first five
innings, Rodriguez entered the game and simply toyed with the San
Francisco lineup.</TE>
<TE>   He threw three perfect innings -- nine up, nine down, four
strikeouts. In his first inning, he retired Rich Aurilia, Jeff Kent
and Barry Bonds on seven pitches. His first 12 pitches were strikes,
22 of 26 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't been here long enough to know how hard that is," Angel
closer Troy Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has appeared in eight playoff games. The Angels have won
them all.</TE>
<TE>   He is 5-0 in October -- tying Randy Johnson's record for victories
in a single postseason -- with 19 strikeouts in 13 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at him," pitcher Jarrod Washburn said, "as an angel."
Capital A or lower-case, it works both ways.</TE>
<TE>   After Rodriguez stopped the Giants cold, and after Salmon took a
curtain call for that second home run, there was more thunder, and
more lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Percival pitched the ninth for the save, exactly the way he had
planned it. The Angels led by two, with Bonds batting third in the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I scripted it from the bullpen," Percival said. "Get the
first two guys out, it doesn't matter how hard he hits it, then get the
next guy out."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit it beyond the distance of mortals, a 97-mph fastball
that landed some 485 feet from home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to walk him," Percival said. "I'm going throw a
pitch as hard as I can, right down the middle. I think I supplied
most of the power."</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of electricity, with flash bulbs popping from
every corner of the ballpark. There were plenty of raucous shouts and
lots of banging sticks one minute later, when Percival retired Benito
Santiago on a pop fly to second baseman Adam Kennedy in shallow right
field for the final out.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the madness of the red sea at Edison Field, there are echoes
of championship seasons past. In the amazing success of Rodriguez,
there are echoes of Orel Hershiser in 1988, when the Dodgers won the
World Series in part because something special happened every time
Hershiser touched the ball.</TE>
<TE>   And, in Salmon's first home run Sunday, there were echoes of 1975,
when Carlton Fisk willed a homer fair as he journeyed down the
first-base line. In the second inning, Salmon hammered a ball down
the left-field line, took a couple steps, then turned to face the
ball, leaned and twisted his body toward first.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know if I'd be able to get it to stay fair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He did, and it did.</TE>
<TE>   Fisk and the Boston Red Sox lost that 1975 Series, but the Red Sox
are a cursed franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels used to be.</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Strikes Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every week the Angels seem to come up with a new nickname for
Francisco Rodriguez, the 20-year-old phenom who has made mannequins
of opposing batters since his major league debut on Sept. 18,
freezing them with his knee-buckling sliders.</LD>
<LD>   First it was Frankie. Then it was F-Rod. Then it was K-Rod. Now,
some teammates are calling him Paco, Spanish for Frankie.</LD>
<LD>   After Sunday night's dazzling display, when Rodriguez retired nine
straight batters from the sixth through eighth innings of the Angels'
dramatic 11-10 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 of the
World Series, his teammates went a step further, inventing new words
to describe the reliever.</LD>
<TE>   "He's unfazeable," fellow reliever Ben Weber said after Rodriguez
struck out four in a remarkable 26-pitch stint, which included 22
strikes. "Is that a word? I don't know ... all I know is that for
this kid to be doing this on the stage he's doing it now is unheard
of."</TE>
<TE>   When Rodriguez took center stage Sunday night, replacing Weber to
start the top of the sixth inning, the teams had already combined for
17 runs and 23 hits in a slugfest that looked as if it might go on
all night. The Angels were trailing, 9-8, at the time, and
desperately needing relief.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez struck out Rich Aurilia looking at a slider and Jeff
Kent swinging at a slider, and Barry Bonds grounded to first.
Rodriguez threw seven pitches in the inning; all were strikes.</TE>
<TE>   After Garret Anderson's clutch two-out, game-tying RBI single in
the bottom of the sixth, Rodriguez struck out Benito Santiago on
three pitches to start the seventh. He jumped ahead of J.T. Snow with
two strikes and extended his string of consecutive strikes to 12
before finally throwing a ball.</TE>
<TE>   Snow eventually grounded out to first, and Reggie Sanders struck
out looking at a slider to end the inning. The right-hander wasn't
quite as dominating in the eighth, getting David Bell to fly to
center, Shawon Dunston to pop to first and Kenny Lofton to ground
back to the mound, with the cat-like Rodriguez leaping to snag
Lofton's one-hopper and tossing to first.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to offend Pedro Martinez," Weber said, referring to
the Boston Red Sox ace who may possess baseball's best breaking
pitch, "but look at that slider [Rodriguez was throwing]. Guys were
missing it by three feet. If it's not Pedro-like, it may be better.</TE>
<TE>   "His fastball is explosive, his slider ... absolute filth. And he
probably has a changeup that he hasn't even broken out yet."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon's two-run homer in the eighth gave the Angels the lead,
and Rodriguez gave way to closer Troy Percival, who, despite Barry
Bonds' 485-foot home run, preserved the victory for Rodriguez, making
him the youngest pitcher to win a World Series game.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, the native of Caracas, Venezuela, improved to 5-0 with
an 1.38 earned-run average in the playoffs, giving up two runs on
four hits and striking out 19 in 13 innings. He tied Randy Johnson
for the most victories in a postseason, a record the Arizona
left-hander set in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a dream come true," Rodriguez said. "One win in the
postseason was great, and now I have five. If I'm dreaming, I don't
want to wake up."</TE>
<TE>   What has impressed the Angels most about Rodriguez, perhaps even
more than his repertoire of nasty pitches, is his composure.</TE>
<TE>   In a tense World Series game, with an Edison Field crowd of 44,584
cranking up the volume every time he went two strikes on a batter,
Rodriguez was a picture of serenity.</TE>
<TE>   "What he has you can't teach," Angel pitching coach Bud Black
said. "The bottom line is he's a fearless pitcher with a lot of
talent."</TE>

<HD>Track Causes Some Surface Tension</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The demand for new ballparks to double as cash machines nearly
resulted in a serious injury to San Francisco first baseman J.T. Snow
on Saturday at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   As Snow chased a foul pop-up, he slipped and fell along the
rubberized warning track in front of the dugout suites behind home
plate. He grabbed the netting that protects fans from foul balls,
scrambled to his feet and made the catch.</LD>
<LD>   The warning track is crushed brick along the outfield wall and
beyond the baselines but rubberized in front of the dugouts and the
suites behind home plate. The rubberized surface prevents fans in the
10 dugout suites -- priced at $183,000 a year -- from dirt that might
be sprayed inside should a player kick up dust while chasing a foul
ball.</LD>
<TE>   If the Angels replaced the rubberized surface with crushed brick,
the dirt would clog the drains serving the dugout suites, according
to Kevin Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president for business
operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to install a new track this winter to replace the
current one, installed in 1998. The track shows numerous signs of
wear, including lumps, holes and cracks, some patched with duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   Snow was sharply critical of the surface Saturday, and
representatives from the commissioner's office and the players' union
said Sunday they would discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Snow is the latest of several players to lose his footing on that
surface. The Angels' Darin Erstad, playing first base during a game
in May, slipped and fell on a surface he calls "like ice" to players
wearing plastic cleats. Players can minimize the risk of slipping by
wearing metal cleats; Snow wore plastic cleats Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Plastic on plastic equals on your butt," San Francisco Manager
Dusty Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel third baseman Troy Glaus, who prefers to wear plastic
cleats, said he exercises extra caution when chasing foul balls.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he dislikes synthetic surfaces
anywhere on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich said he would be willing to meet with Scioscia and any
interested players to discuss whether the surface is truly hazardous.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make this the best field we can," Uhlich said. "But
it's the same surface we've had for four years without anybody
complaining or saying we have to pull it out."</TE>

<HD>Eckstein's Contribution Is Short and Very Sweet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He had scored the go-ahead run in what turned out to be the Angels'
first World Series victory, scampering home ahead of Tim Salmon's
two-run blast to left field in the tumultuous eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   But David Eckstein, at the center of a red storm at home plate,
had only one thought as he waited for Salmon to complete a joyful
trip around the bases:</LD>
<LD>   Self-preservation.</LD>
<TE>   "Didn't you see that I leaned back?" Eckstein said, smiling. "The
first guy he hits after he hits a home run, he hits hard. He's hit me
before. I've learned."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein braced himself for Salmon's greeting and survived with
nary a scratch. He'd be more than willing to put himself in danger of
being bowled over again if that means Salmon has ignited the Angels'
offense as he did Sunday, when he hit two two-run home runs in the
11-10 victory over the San Francisco Giants that tied the World
Series at one game each.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just very happy, very happy," said Eckstein, who had three
hits and scored three runs, the first ahead of Salmon on the right
fielder's two-run shot off Giant starter Russ Ortiz in the second
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows what Tim's been through with this organization.
There was probably a lot of frustration on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein's own frustration ended resoundingly Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He is a severe critic of his own play, and he had insisted he was
not doing all he could to keep the Angels' postseason journey on a
triumphant course. But in a game the Angels felt a pressing need to
win before the Series shifts to San Francisco's Pacific Bell Park
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Eckstein seemed to be constantly on
the basepaths, never letting the Giants pause for breath.</TE>
<TE>   He also got his jersey smeared with brown dirt from the Edison
Field infield, a sure sign he had been active and involved on offense
and defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to get dirty," he said. "If it's clean, I didn't play
well."</TE>
<TE>   He played exceptionally well against the Giants Sunday. He led off
the first inning with a single to right and scored on Darin Erstad's
double. He led off the second with bunt single and scored again, this
time ahead of Salmon's first homer.</TE>
<TE>   He grounded out in the fourth and sixth innings, but he ignited
the offense in the eighth with a single to right. After Erstad was
retired on a fly ball to left, Eckstein scored on Salmon's two-run
blast off Felix Rodriguez, as the Angels took an 11-10 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very happy, because that gave us a two-run lead, and I knew
Percy [Troy Percival] was coming into the game," Eckstein said. I was
also happy for Tim ...</TE>
<TE>   "My main thing is to get on base. I really haven't done my job as
far as scoring runs. My job is to get on base and score runs, and it
feels good to finally do it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the rally monkey has become the Angels' good-luck charm,
Eckstein certainly brings them more luck through hard work.
Generously listed on the Angels' postseason roster as 5 feet 8 -- a
height he might reach on tiptoes while wearing hockey skates -- he is
accustomed to facing doubters and proving it's not the size of your
frame but the size of your heart that matters.</TE>
<TE>   He has never been given a free pass from anyone, and that was true
Sunday. Ortiz and the Giant relievers saw him not as a little guy but
as a big threat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the biggest guy in the world," he said, "and so guys are
going to come after me. I hit a slider [Sunday] and [Robb] Nen struck
me out on a breaking ball [Saturday], so they're not just throwing
fastballs over the plate."</TE>
<TE>   His tenacity has won him many new admirers. Sitting in his locker
stall were more than a few fan letters -- "No proposals, no," he said
-- and most had arrived since the Angels' late-season and postseason
success.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein gets a steady stream of requests from all ages to sign
baseball cards. Many say he's an inspiration to them, a sentiment
that touches him deeply. His athletic hero was Doug Flutie, who never
let a similarly small build squelch his competitive fires.</TE>
<TE>   "I get that a lot," Eckstein said, "from kids saying they like my
style, the game I play, and parents saying the same thing. It's very
humbling to see how you can affect someone's life."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Eckstein knows the team still has a long way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We're planning on five more games," he said. "This series is so
even, that's probably how it will go."</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   Bottom of the eighth, runner on first, two out, score tied. Tim
Salmon homers to left field to give the Angels an 11-9 lead. The
two-run homer was especially important because it made Barry Bonds'
solo homer in the top of the ninth relatively meaningless. It was
Salmon's second two-run homer of the game.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   When Bonds homered to deep, deep right in the ninth, the Fox
cameras showed Salmon in the Angel dugout, who said, "That's the
farthest ball I've ever seen hit." And the fact his team still
trailed by a run didn't stop Bonds from watching his homer. It was a
beautiful homer, but it meant nothing, not that that mattered to
Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   It looked as though the Angels were headed for a 2-0 Series
deficit when the Giants scored four runs in the fifth for a 9-7 lead.
All the excitement from the Angels' quick start, scoring five runs in
the first inning, was taken away from the Edison Field crowd. But the
Angels had one more rally left in them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Rodriguez looked like a seasoned veteran on the mound.
The Giants' offense was battering the Angel bullpen until Rodriguez
came in and threw three perfect innings, allowing the Angels to come
back and win the game. In all the talk about Salmon's homer, don't
forget it was Rodriguez' pitching that allowed that moment to take
place.</TE>

<HD>A Leading Question</HD>
<DH>Many top managers are former catchers, but not everyone
thinks there is a connection</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both of their big-league experiences were tinted in Dodger Blue, but
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia learned his craft from behind the plate
while San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker was in the outfield.</LD>
<LD>   So does that give Scioscia any sort of edge in the matchup of
managers in this World Series?</LD>
<LD>   This much is certain: In recent seasons, some of the most
successful managers have been catchers, beginning with Joe Torre, a
former catcher who led the New York Yankees to the World Series
championship in four of the last six seasons.</LD>
<TE>   The manager who beat Torre last season was Bob Brenly of the
Arizona Diamondbacks, himself a former catcher. And the manager who
knocked the Yankees out this year? Scioscia, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Leyland, a successful manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates
before leading the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship in
1997, was a former catcher.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no absolutes. Among Hall of Fame managers, Tom
Lasorda was a pitcher, Casey Stengel was an outfielder and Sparky
Anderson was an infielder.</TE>
<TE>   Big numbers on the field don't necessarily translate into big
numbers for the man calling the shots from the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams was arguably the greatest hitter ever. As a manager,
there's no argument. He wasn't great, or even exceptional. In three
of his four seasons managing the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers,
Williams lost more than 90 games, losing 100 in his final year. And
his teams never finished higher than fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Alston, a first baseman in his playing days, struck out in
his only major league at-bat. Yet he was the most successful manager
in Dodger history, winning four World Series and lasting 23 seasons
at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   So do catchers have some sort of advantage when it comes to
managing?</TE>
<TE>   "Not necessarily," said Tim McCarver, a major league catcher for
21 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and
briefly with the Montreal Expos and Boston Red Sox before becoming a
broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   But having said that, McCarver proceeded to enumerate reason after
reason why catchers might have an edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that catchers have a unique opportunity to be good
managers because of what they have gone through," McCarver said. "Now
I'm not trying to paint them as martyrs, but they have taken a
beating behind the plate, so they understand the physical woes of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "But they also understand the mental aspect. Most managers do not
necessarily understand how to call a game. The pitcher thinks
differently than the manager. They come at the catcher from both
sides, so he learns patience."</TE>
<TE>   The catcher finds himself with the best view in the stadium once
he puts on the pads and mask and crouches behind the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees the whole field," McCarver said. "He can see if the
center fielder got a good jump on a ball. He can see how the
infielders pinch in. He can see how the first baseman and third
baseman guard the lines late in a game. And he gets to watch the
great hitters from only two feet away. He can see how they plant
their feet. He comes to understand that a slider will go further than
any other pitch when it is hung. He gets an understanding of all
these elements that go into a game."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, McCarver said other players tend not to get involved
in aspects of the game that don't directly concern them.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are there not more pitchers who make good managers?" McCarver
said. "Because while catchers have a peripheral view of the game,
pitchers are myopic. Theirs is a solitary existence. They are
concerned with what they have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Lasorda, of course, disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a slam to pitchers," he said. "Pitchers are smart. They
have to know the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing hitters.
They have to know where everybody is in the field. They have to look
at the runners.</TE>
<TE>   "I know some catchers who were so dumb, when they were giving
signals, they had to look down to see how many fingers they were
flashing."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Lasorda said, it comes down to a desire to learn the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sat on the bench," he said, "I would always ask my manager
why he was doing things a certain way."</TE>
<TE>   McCarver said he wasn't just picking on pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not alone," he explained. "What is a first baseman
primarily concerned with? His hitting. Do you think the center
fielder gives a bleep if the second baseman's footing is not right on
the pivot while turning a double play?"</TE>
<TE>   Torre agrees that catchers are more plugged into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to be aware of more things as a catcher," the
Yankee manager said. "You see everything develop right in front of
you. A catcher probably has more of a relationship with a manager
because pitching is such a big part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   That's not necessarily a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   McCarver recalled being summoned to the mound by the manager when
a pitcher was struggling.</TE>
<TE>   "How's he throwing?" the manager asked.</TE>
<TE>   "What was I supposed to say in front of that pitcher?" McCarver
said. "That he is throwing like bleep so get the hook out here? Here
the manager was destroying what I had been working on developing with
my pitchers over a five-year period."</TE>
<TE>   So a catcher also learns diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   But Scioscia, while a proud member of the catching fraternity,
doesn't buy into the theory that his background makes him better
suited to manage.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is," he said, "there are a lot of managers -- like
Dusty Baker and Lou Piniella -- who haven't played catcher in their
career, yet there's nothing they don't understand nor have a grasp
of. There are some insights you get maybe a little quicker as a
catcher, but it certainly doesn't put you ahead of the game. I don't
think so anyway. There are managers who understand every bit as much
as I do or more so about the pitcher-catcher relationship who were
never catchers."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's critics in the division series against the Yankees
would certainly agree. He was hammered in the media for his use, or
rather lack of use, of closer Troy Percival in key situations.</TE>
<TE>   See, those who dispute the catcher/manager link will say, even
with his background, Scioscia doesn't know how to handle pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, those who support the catcher/manager link will say, he's
having more success than any Angel manager ever.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the bottom line?</TE>
<TE>   If you learn strategy, patience, diplomacy and people skills, all
strengths for a catcher, you have a chance to be a good manager.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't learn all that, whether behind the plate or
elsewhere, you won't be much of a manager.</TE>
<TE>   And you probably wouldn't have been much of a catcher, either.</TE>

<AU>DEAN CHANCE</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at age 23, he won the Cy
Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11 shutouts
and 15 complete games. He was also a 20-game winner with Minnesota in
1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a boxing promoter,
is guest analyst for The Times for this World Series.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   You know, I watched this game and the first thing that came to
mind was Billy Martin. Remember the way he managed, the way he had
guys playing aggressively, the way he would have a guy try to steal
home when the pitcher was in the stretch position. Billy Martin
forced the action.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Scioscia is managing the same way with these Angels. He has
them playing so aggressively. He has all his players using good
judgment at the plate. He's stressing advancing the runners. He's
getting them to hit to the opposite field. When a right-handed hitter
hits to right, he has so much more space to work with, so much more
than when he pulls the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Here's Scioscia in the first inning, he already has four runs in
and he calls for the double steal and [Brad] Fullmer steals home.</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time you saw the Dodgers play that aggressively?</TE>
<TE>   Now some of that -- moving runners over and hitting the opposite
way -- may get lost with all the big hits, but if you have it all,
the big stuff and the small stuff, you get an offense like the one
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   This was just a tremendous game, unbelievable. Tim Salmon had a
great night. You couldn't ask more of the offense, you couldn't ask
more of the defense.</TE>
<TE>   But I have to tell you, the pitching early in the game was, at
times, terrible. You can't give up a home run on an 0-2 pitch like
Kevin Appier did with Reggie Sanders. I know pitchers have bad days,
but what a time to have a bad day.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not trying to second-guess anybody, but I would have brought
the kid (Francisco Rodriguez) in earlier. In a game like this, when
you get up by a few runs, the most important thing is the next inning
for the other side. If you can shut them down in that inning, it
takes the heart right out of them.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has a great live arm. This kid is amazing. He threw a
slider to J.T. Snow that I think Snow missed by two feet. It was
perfect, low and inside.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody who has ever been connected to the Angels, and I'm not
just talking about former players, but batboys, equipment men, even
newspaper guys, have to feel a tremendous amount of pride.</TE>
<TE>   You know, I'm in boxing, but everybody's a baseball fan now and it
seems like everybody I talk to is an Angel fan.</TE>

<LD>This is no time to stop Bud.</LD>
<LD>   Nor is 7:07 p.m. CDT any time to start a World Series game, not
when it could have been played in the afternoon. Little Leaguers
shouldn't have to tune in Sunday morning's "SportsCenter" to find out
whether Barry Bonds homered again after they went to bed, and Bud
Selig knows it.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioner understands the romance of October day baseball,
and the hold it can have on the ticket-buyers of tomorrow, as well as
anyone. Yet he has never done anything more than sigh or shrug and
cash the network check when he's asked why Series games have to start
so late.</LD>
<TE>   While Selig rewrites his legacy, with this year's labor deal
improving the long-term outlook for some franchises that otherwise
were headed for skid row, he needs to throw himself on another
economic grenade.</TE>
<TE>   If Selig wants to become beloved for all the right reasons -- and
you'd better believe he does -- he'll find a way to restore day ball
to the Series at some point before he retires.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to give kids in the Central and Eastern Time Zones a
chance to see watch Series dramatics in real time.</TE>

<TE>   As has become tradition whenever the World Series comes to a
star-studded area, Major League Baseball distributes to the media a
"partial list" of celebrities in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Subway Series in New York brought out some of
the biggest names in the entertainment business, A-list celebs such
as Jack Nicholson, Jennifer Lopez and Sean "Puffy" Combs. But the
all-California Series appears to be experiencing a celebrity deficit
syndrome, with Hollywood has-beens David Hasselhoff and Eric Roberts
making the list.</TE>
<TE>   Watching an Angels game has never been quite so trendy. But where
are the Nicholsons, the Chris Rocks and the Dustin Hoffmans of the
world?</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sullivan</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Tribune</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is fitting the San Francisco Giants are part of the first World
Series involving two wild-card teams.</TE>
<TE>   They were, after all, part of the evidence presented when the wild
card was adopted for the 1995 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had won 103 games in 1993, but they didn't qualify for
the postseason because they finished one game behind Atlanta in the
National League West.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Giants won 95 games and qualified for the
postseason, even though they finished 2 1/2 games behind Arizona in
the NL West. San Francisco qualified for the postseason because it
won the NL wild card. It then proceeded to knock off Atlanta and St.
Louis to reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Angels, meanwhile, won a franchise-record 99
regular-season games and finished second to Oakland in the American
League West. But they earned the AL wild-card berth and advanced to
the World Series by beating the New York Yankees and Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Now, either the Giants or Angels will become the second wild-card
team to claim a world championship, joining the Florida Marlins, who
earned that distinction in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with the way things have turned out," said
baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, whose endorsement of the wild card
did not help his rating in popularity polls. "What we had to consider
was we went from 16 teams [in 1960] to 30 teams [in 1998]. To live
with a format designed in the 1920s doesn't make sense anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Is he happy enough with the arrangement to consider adding more
wild-card teams to the postseason?</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people pushing for that," Selig said. "I'm not
in favor of it in the immediate future, but that doesn't mean it
won't happen."</TE>

<TE>   Rocky Mountain News</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I may be retro, but I do not share the aesthetic appreciation of
the World Series camera crew presenting so many images of the two
managers' faces.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly our National Pass-Time is excruciatingly slow for
persons not doing other things concurrently, and precious TV time
needs to be filled. Can you give us the equivalent of radio's Dizzy
Dean singing the Wabash Cannonball and telling "Me 'n Paul" stories
during rain interruptions of Cardinals' games enjoyed when I was a
boy?</TE>

<HD>Magowan: No More Comments on Baker</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned about the status of Manager Dusty Baker becoming a
distraction, the owner of the San Francisco Giants said Sunday he
won't comment on the situation for the remainder of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Magowan, managing general partner, stepped into the
spotlight Saturday at Edison Field, saying a decision on General
Manager Brian Sabean, who is expected to return, could come "a day or
two" after the Giants' final game, and that the managerial situation
would be resolved "within a week."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking before Game 2, Magowan said he wants to keep the focus on
the field.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm done talking about it," he said. "Even though I didn't really
want to talk about this the other day, I felt I owed it to the
out-of-town [reporters] to talk about it one more time; not two more
times or eight more times. I do think it is a distraction from the
World Series and I hate to see that happen. To some extent, I have to
admit that I've been part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the one who said in spring training that we've got the best
team we've had here and I want to wait and see how this team performs
before we see who my general manager is and who my manager is. Dusty
didn't like that type of pressure being put on him and I thought it
was fair. We had a difference of philosophy that I think was pretty
important. I don't know what else I can say."</TE>
<TE>   Baker was surprised Magowan plans to move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know he wanted to have a manager in place a week after
the season. That's kind of quick," the three-time manager of the year
said. "Plus, my contract calls for a 10-day [negotiating] clause
after the season. But he's the boss."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trying to upgrade at third base, the Seattle Mariners traded David
Bell to the Giants in January and acquired Jeff Cirillo from the
Colorado Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bell, who plays every infield position, was a steady
contributor on a club that set an American League record with 116
victories, the Mariners believed Cirillo would make them better. They
were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Cirillo batted .249 with six home runs and 54 runs batted in, and
the Mariners missed the playoffs, finishing third in the AL West
behind the Oakland Athletics and Angels. Bell had a big role in the
Giants' success, playing well defensively and batting .261 with 20
homers, 29 doubles and 73 RBIs as the Giants held off the Dodgers for
the National League wild-card berth. Before Sunday, Bell was batting
.357 in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is very unpredictable," said Bell, a third-generation
major leaguer. "When I came here, I knew this was a team with a real
good chance. The Mariners have a great team there, but they're just
in a real competitive division."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman J.T. Snow said he was "fine" a day after landing
flat on his back on the synthetic warning track while making a
sensational catch in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm perfect," the six-time Gold Glove award winner said.</TE>
<TE>   -- Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Giants are headed to Pacific Bell Park for the next
three games, making these the first World Series games played in San
Francisco since the 1989 series at Candlestick Park that was
interrupted by an earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "In '89, I was actually drinking a cup of coffee in the cafeteria
in the clubhouse," said Baker, who was a coach under Roger Craig at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Just sort of weird the way things started -- they didn't really
shake, they sort of flowed. It looked like Jell-O."</TE>
<TE>   He remembered the safety tips his daughter had learned during
earthquake-awareness week at school and passed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me to get under a desk or something, or stand in a door
well," he said. "I went and stood in the door well, tried not to
panic, stopped shaking."</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Takes Worst of It for the Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everything in the World Series is magnified because that's what
happens when there are two teams left and only one prize.</LD>
<LD>   So Russ Ortiz is definitely under the microscope.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giant right-hander had one of the worst
performances of a starter in World Series history Sunday night in the
Angels' exhausting 11-10 victory in Game 2 before 44,584 at Edison
Field.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a little surprising," Giant right fielder Reggie Sanders
said. "You know that anything can happen, but Russ is a strong guy.
He's been great for us."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was chased after only 1 2/3 innings, giving up nine hits and
seven earned runs for a 37.80 earned-run average. It was ugly from
for the start for Ortiz, who didn't see it coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I was feeling great," Ortiz said. "Just like before any other
start, I was feeling pumped up and ready to go. I just didn't
execute."</TE>
<TE>   That's for sure.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels raced to a 5-0 first-inning lead against the former
standout at Van Nuys Montclair Prep, batting around and inspiring
fans to get their noise sticks going.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence in Russ," third baseman David Bell
said. "He's had a lot of success throwing the ball for us this year,
but these things happen. And there was a lot of offense in this game.
It wasn't all against him."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants did what they could to help Ortiz, getting back into
the game with four runs in the second against equally ineffective
Angel starter Kevin Appier. Then Ortiz's nightmare continued in the
second before Manager Dusty Baker ended his day.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon's first home run -- a two-run shot -- gave the Angels a
7-4 lead, but Baker stayed with his proven 14-game winner. That is
until Troy Glaus doubled with two out, giving Baker no choice with
the Giants still in the game because Appier was still working for the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if Russ was nervous," Baker said. "He's a calm young
man, so just give them credit for doing some hitting. They were
hitting him early in the count. They were going first to third on us.
They just ... their bats were hot.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows they can hit. I don't know if that's Russ' fault
or if it's to their credit. You've seen this club hot before and they
came out hot."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz would second that.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are big, strong guys," said Ortiz, who has struggled
since the National League division series. "These guys know how to
hit. If you make mistakes they are going to hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Going out for the second inning, I felt like I'd be able to get
out of that inning. I don't know exactly where that pitch to Salmon
was, but it obviously wasn't in the right place. Just a bad night."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz went 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA in the Giants' division series
victory over the Atlanta Braves, winning the opener and final game.</TE>
<TE>   He has no-decisions in his last two postseason starts with a 15.63
ERA, giving up 14 hits and 11 earned runs in 6 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   However, Ortiz isn't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "To us it's just as intense as it is anytime. You always get
butterflies, or at least I do, before every game. It can happen
whether it's spring training or the first game of the year. You just
have to put it aside."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is counting on pitching again this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 1-1 now, so I just have to feel good about that and be ready
when they want me to pitch again," he said. "I will be."</TE>

<HD>It's Enough to Make Mauch Come Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>diane Pucin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It felt good to Gene Mauch, sitting in the box belonging to Jackie
Autry, watching the Angels playing in the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The noise, all the red, all the emotions, it made Mauch's skin
tingle, it brought goose bumps to his arms.</LD>
<LD>   "When I tried to imagine a World Series in Anaheim," Mauch said,
"I'll tell you what. I never quite envisioned this."</LD>
<TE>   Mauch swept his arms out, pointing to the exuberance that filled
Edison Field, even in the top of the fifth, while the Giants were
scoring four runs.</TE>
<TE>   When Mauch was managing the Angels during the 1986 playoffs, Mauch
said the noise level never approached what he heard Sunday night at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this," Mauch said, "I could talk to my catcher, Bob Boone,
and he could hear me. And we had over 60,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   Mauch, who managed the Angels in both the 1982 and 1986 playoffs,
had chosen not to attend the American League championship series
against the Minnesota Twins because he had worried that his presence,
especially in case of a loss, might reinforce the idea that he
contributed to some so-called jinx.</TE>
<TE>   And when asked if he'll be back for Games 6 and 7, should they be
played, Mauch said that it depended.</TE>
<TE>   "Only if the Angels win tonight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mauch didn't mean that he thought the Series would be over if the
Angels lost. He meant that he would have felt he had brought some bad
luck.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Angels scored five in the first," Mauch said, "and
everybody in here was jumping around, I told them I've seen a lot of
guys who birdie the first hole and shoot 80."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, don't get too excited was Mauch's message.</TE>

<HD>Appier Puts Pressure on Angels' Staff</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were 28 hits and 21 runs, and buried somewhere under the debris
was Kevin Appier.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels survived Game 2 of the World Series, but ...</LD>
<LD>   Did Appier?</LD>
<TE>   Did their rotation?</TE>
<TE>   Long after they had finished measuring Barry Bonds' 485-foot home
run on Troy Percival's 97-mph fastball in the ninth inning, long
after final tabulations documented that the Angels had indeed
defeated the San Francisco Giants, 11-10, to salvage a split of the
first two games, there were only cursory answers to the above
questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Appier, who was unable to sustain leads of 5-0 and 7-4 or finish
the third inning in a continuation of what has been an ongoing
inability to deliver innings, did survive to the extent that he was
walking and talking in the clubhouse and is still scheduled to start
Game 6 at Edison Field on Saturday, if it's necessary.</TE>
<TE>   * The rotation will remain as it was, even though John Lackey, the
scheduled Game 4 starter, was summoned to relieve Appier and stop the
early bleeding in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey pitched 2 1/3 innings against the Giants, threw 32 pitches
and is still scheduled to start that Game 4 on Wednesday, after Ramon
Ortiz starts Game 3 on Tuesday night and before Jarrod Washburn
returns in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, since they are carrying only 10 pitchers (the Giants
have 11), and have yet to use Scot Shields in the postseason, the
Angels don't have a lot of rotation maneuverability short of bringing
back Washburn on three days' rest in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn admitted he was gassed when he last started on three
days' rest in Game 4 of the division series against the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there was an unspoken belief that Sunday's win and a
split going into Pacific Bell Park was imperative.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, when Appier came up lacking, the call went to Lackey, who
said he will have no problem making his start in two days.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be just fine," he said, his normal bullpen session on Sunday
having been canceled in case Appier struggled early, as he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I only threw 30 or so pitches and I usually throw more in the
pen," Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "At that point in the game, we had a
little freedom with John. We could give him a couple innings and
still bring him back in [Game 4]. He probably could have gone a
little more but not with a start in two days."</TE>
<TE>   As Scioscia and his staff watched their 5-0, first-inning lead
unravel and they were ultimately forced to remove Appier before he
had an out in the third inning, there was some eventual thought given
to bringing Appier right back in Game 4, but, the manager said,
"right now it's Lackey."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take the ball whenever they give it to me," said the rookie
who delivered seven shutout innings as the starter in Game 4 of the
ALCS against the Minnesota Twins and three shutout relief innings in
Game 3 of the division series against the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't quite as sharp against the Giants as he was charged with
two hits, a walk and two runs in his 2 1/3 innings, but "I was able
to slow them down a little and Frankie slammed the door again."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to Francisco Rodriguez, who dominated the Giants in
three perfect relief innings, and improved to 5-0 in the continuation
of an improbable saga.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and Lackey are simply unfazed by the postseason
pressure, or as Lackey said of his first World Series assignment: "It
helps to get my feet wet, to get a little experience before I have to
start, but it's not much different than the LCS or division series. I
mean, the stands can't get much fuller."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' ultimate victory removed some of the sting for Appier,
who gave up five hits, five runs and three home runs in his two-plus
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "As horrible as I still feel," he said, "if we had lost I'd have
beat myself up even more than I will anyway. I didn't have much life
on my stuff, and they were all over every little mistake I made."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of an 0-3 September in which he gave up 26 hits
and 14 runs in only 21 1/3 innings of his last four starts, Appier
has made four postseason starts, lasting five, five, 5 1/3 and two
innings. He has allowed 20 hits and 12 runs for a postseason
earned-run average of 5.57. In his last eight starts, encompassing
the September struggle, his ERA is 6.05.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black have often said that
Appier's mechanics are the most difficult on the staff to maintain,
and the manager said after Sunday's survival that the veteran starter
-- at 34 Appier was being counted on to lead the young rotation
through the pressure of the postseason -- is simply missing his spots
and making too many pitches, putting strain on the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "We still feel he has enough in his tank to give us another start,
and we're going to need it," Scioscia said. "We don't have a lot of
options."</TE>
<TE>   Appier said he considered his three previous starts during the
current postseason to have been solid, that he was hurt in a couple
instances by bloop hits (which he was), that he felt that he made a
quality pitch to Reggie Sanders in the second inning Sunday night and
was shocked that Sanders was able to collapse his hands, get to the
inside fastball and slug a three-run homer that put the Giants back
in the game after the Angels had scored those five runs in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Replays seemed to show that the pitch had more of the center of
the plate than Appier may have wanted to remember, but Appier said
that despite his statistical struggle over the last two months, as
"bummed out as I am right now by the way I pitched tonight, it didn't
kill my confidence and I'm looking forward to doing better in my next
start."</TE>
<TE>   Whether that is in Game 6 or next April remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Appier reflected on the fact that his starting foe Sunday night,
Russ Ortiz (who had won eight straight decisions), lasted only 1 2/3
innings, giving up nine hits and seven runs, and made a valid point.</TE>
<TE>   "From start to finish," Appier said, "it wasn't much of a night
for pitching -- with the exception of Francisco, of course."</TE>
<TE>   Of course.</TE>

<LD>For a decade their names have been synonymous, in good times and bad,
this small pond and its giant fish.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels and Tim Salmon.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon and the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Always in the same breath. Forever in the same sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Eternally waiting, it seemed, for a brilliant night like Sunday,
when they could share even the same champions' thump of a heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   Early in World Series Game 2 against the San Francisco Giants, the
Angels were flying, and Salmon was their tail wind.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through Game 2, the Angels were diving, and Salmon was
their storm.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth inning of Game 2, score tied at 9-all, the Angels needed a
hero.</TE>
<TE>   And Salmon was at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it might as well have been me," he said later, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   After all these years, could it have been anybody else?</TE>
<TE>   First pitch from tiring Felix Rodriguez, Salmon swatted it over
the left-field fence as easily as a man tossing a candy wrapper into
his kitchen waste basket.</TE>
<TE>   He rounded the bases like a man strolling from the living room to
the den.</TE>
<TE>   He crossed the plate with the eventual game-winning run, his
teammates hopping up and down in the dugout, the Edison Field crowd
lifting its voices higher than a geyser, and you could feel it as he
felt it.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon had, indeed, in every sense of the word, come home.</TE>
<TE>   Home, after a two-run homer that eventually gave the Angels an
11-10 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Home, after saving his team from a possible Series death blow,
evening the thing at one game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Home, where his heart has always been, even if his swing has not.</TE>
<TE>   "You cheer for everybody on our team, of course," said third base
coach Ron Roenicke. "But when a guy like Tim does well, it's like,
yeah."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody symbolizes the Angels' recent history more than Salmon. He
even has the statistics to prove it before this fall, his league-high
1,388 games played without a playoff appearance.</TE>
<TE>   There is also no better representative of their daily struggles
even now, from his comeback after last year's possible career-ending
futility to his comeback during Sunday's four-hour exercise in
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   It actually started Saturday night, in Game 1, when Salmon didn't
have a clue at the plate, failing in all four at-bats in the Angels'
4-3 loss, including a weak pop foul with one out and runners on first
and third in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of Salmon, "I was up a lot last night thinking about the
popup there," he said. "Last night ... it was a tough night."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sunday, when he singled and scored in the first inning,
then hit a two-run homer in the second inning, and it looked as if
the Angels were going to turn the Giants into just another group of
blubbering Yankees or Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim gets mad, but he doesn't mope," said batting coach Mickey
Hatcher. "He does something about it."</TE>
<TE>   But then Kevin Appier failed to show up, and the Giants dragged
out some former Dodger farmhand named Zerbe to haunt the Angel
offense, and suddenly the Angels were trailing.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just as suddenly, they weren't, when Garret Anderson lined a
ball to right field to score Darin Erstad with the tying run with two
out in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   And here was Salmon again, back in the middle of the madness,
rounding second base on that hit, stopping there with Troy Glaus up
at the plate ... but no! He didn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   He kept running, and the throw from right fielder Reggie Sanders
was cut off by first baseman J.T. Snow, who threw to the other side
of the diamond to help catch Salmon in a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   End of inning and rally. From hero to hoax in about an hour.
Another typical Salmon career mood swing.</TE>
<TE>   Except you know what Roenicke said to Salmon as he left the field?</TE>
<TE>   He told him he did fine. He told him he did not mess up.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim handed me his helmet and asked me whether I thought that
Sanders' throw was going through to the plate, and I thought it was,
so he did the right thing by going to third base," said Roenicke.
"That's what we do around here. We're aggressive, and if it hurts us
sometimes, we'll deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was still thinking about this when he came to the plate in
the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein had reached first base on a one-out line drive to
right field.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad had reached into Rodriguez's stamina with a splendid,
eight-pitch at-bat that resulted in a fly out.</TE>
<TE>   It was Salmon's turn to be, well, what do you think?</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive. Mad. The master of his house.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a feeling it was going to come down to something like
that," he said. "That's something I've been dreaming about doing for
a long time, and watching it being done from my couch. It was
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   And, as the ball sailed over the fence and the owner strolled the
grounds, absolutely perfect.</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Has Right Approach on Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The child led them.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 20-year-old who scuffed at the dirt with his feet, as
if he were a bull looking at the red cape. Francisco Rodriguez didn't
play games with Barry Bonds. Rodriguez didn't nibble at the corners
or try to paint wavy lines with a soft brush. Rodriguez threw and
threw hard, one pitch to Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds swung. He couldn't help himself, and Bonds hit the ball,
hard. But on the ground. Sharply. But at Scott Spiezio. With
authority but into a quick and satisfying out.</LD>
<TE>   And the looks on the faces of the Angels in the dugout, the smiles
and grins, the high fives and whoops and hollers, it made a
difference that out did, that pitch did, that decisiveness did, that
fearlessness did.</TE>
<TE>   Do some math.</TE>
<TE>   In the three innings when Bonds walked Sunday night -- the second,
the third and the fifth -- the Giants scored nine runs. In the two
innings when Bonds hit, they scored one.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the one was a home run, a monster home run, the longest and
hardest ball, Tim Salmon said, that he had ever seen hit. But it came
with two out, with the bases empty, in the top of the ninth, when the
Angels were leading by two runs. And closer Troy Percival grooved
one, right down the middle, hard as can be. So the ball went very
far, very fast. And it didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   It is the walks that play on minds, make heads spin, make pitching
harder.</TE>
<TE>   If you routinely put a man on base, it makes everything else you
do harder. It makes playing defense trickier, it makes your pitcher
think more, worry more, have more things on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't the World Series supposed to be your best against their
best? Your best hitter against their best pitcher? And the other way
around?</TE>
<TE>   With apologies to Keyshawn Johnson, a fine man with a USC
education, which means he must be right, just pitch Barry the damn
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Percival said after the most nail-biting, heart-pounding,
stomach-churning, gut-wrenching, maddening, exhilarating, horrifying,
wonderful baseball game in a very long time, "you don't want to start
a rally with a walk. You saw what happened in the second inning. You
don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The second inning, when Bonds led off with a walk, just after the
Angels had scored five in the bottom of the first and had brought the
Angel fans, who were desperate for something to go crazy over, to a
frenzy. And then Bonds was on first, grinning as if he knew
something, hopping back and forth as if he expected to soon be on the
run.</TE>
<TE>   And he was. Off to third on a single by J.T. Snow and trotting
home on Reggie Sanders' home run, which was followed by a David Bell
home run, which was followed by too many runs to compute in this
game, too much momentum changing, and very nearly a Series-killing
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn said, "as an athlete you
want the greatest challenges possible and pitching to Barry Bonds is
the greatest athletic challenge I can imagine. I want that challenge.
Me, personally, Mike Scioscia is going to have to come out and tell
me not to pitch to him. My opinion is that if he hits a home run off
me, good for him. If I get him out, good for me. But one home run is
one home run. A walk, that can start lots of other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   There may be times to walk a guy, any guy. There may be more times
to walk Bonds. But don't do it as a routine. And don't do it because
you are being too careful and too afraid. Because when you start
nibbling, start aiming instead of pitching, then it becomes hard to
switch gears and become aggressive to Benito Santiago or Snow or
Sanders or Jeff Kent or Bell and they will hit home runs too and
doubles and singles and finish rallies that Bonds started with the
simple walk.</TE>
<TE>   It's better not to groove it. Percival grooved it and grinned. "I
supplied most of the power," Percival said. "But I did my job. I told
myself I'd go hard after the first two guys and get them and go hard
after Barry and if Barry got me, I'd go hard after the next guy."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what he did. Percival got Rich Aurilia to fly out to
Garret Anderson. It took two pitches. He got Kent to fly out to
Anderson after working an 0-and-2 count. Bonds hit Percival's second
fastball over and out so the score was 11-10 instead of 11-9. And it
took Percival four fastballs to get Santiago to pop out to second
baseman Adam Kennedy. If Percival walks Bonds, then he's thinking.
What if Santiago hits it out next? Score is tied. Or what if Santiago
singles and Snow comes up with two guys on? What if? What if? A
pitcher can't do his job while he's thinking "What if?"</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy pitching in the World Series. It's much harder if
Bonds is always standing on first base. Smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he never got nervous, that he was excited and not
afraid, that he enjoyed pitching to Bonds. "It felt good," Rodriguez
said. "Better to pitch him than to walk him."</TE>
<TE>   The sixth inning, when Rodriguez went hard after Aurilia, then
Kent and most importantly, Bonds, when he struck out Aurilia and Kent
and got Bonds to hit that first pitch to Spiezio, it was when the
game turned the Angels' way.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez pitched to Bonds. Like everybody should.</TE>

<HD>He Looks High and Low for Noise-Buster Garrett</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A USC spokesman said Athletic Director Mike Garrett might be at
Edison Field for Game 2 of the World Series, and when a Stealth
bomber flew overhead at the conclusion of the national anthem, I
wondered if it was at Garrett's suggestion.</LD>
<LD>   As you know, Garrett doesn't like noise at sporting events, and
while he came to the wrong place, recently he was the guy who led a
successful move to ban Angel-like noise sticks from all Pacific 10
Conference stadiums.</LD>
<LD>   Now at first I found this comical, because there was a time when
Garrett would carry on like no other fan at a football game, and as a
result the Pac-10 established a "Garrett rule" banning him and all
other ADs from the press box -- insisting they sit somewhere else ...
I presume in sound-proof Garrett boxes.</LD>
<TE>   But then I took a walk around Edison Field on Sunday night, and
I'm not sure you will find a group of fans having a better time or
making more noise. And I wonder what he thought.</TE>
<TE>   Now maybe these people were just thrilled because they weren't
home and suffering through a Fox telecast, but I'm telling you, it's
hard to fall asleep when the fans begin the rhythmic pounding of the
noise sticks, and I could use a pair to get me through one of Coach
Pete Carroll's news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought when I read that USC banned them was the rich
boosters didn't want all that noise around them, and Garrett was just
catering to the snooty older folks who go to the games," said Skip
Allen, USC class of '71.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the crazy thing about this Series, because
traditionally the fans are more USC laid-back than the regular-season
baseball crowd, since it's the corporate set that gets most of the
tickets. But rich or not, these people were carrying on as if it was
the greatest night of their lives -- Tim Salmon confirming that
nearly four hours into the screaming night -- and the charged
atmosphere had to play a role in giving the rest of the country a
wonderful night of entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   So early on I went looking for Garrett -- figuring the ear-plugged
grouch would stand out in a crowd of two-week-old Angel fans -- with
the intention of talking some sense into him. The only guy who stood
out, however, was KCAL's Alan Massengale dressed all in black, and I
had no idea he was such a Giants' fan, but then I guess you'd have to
watch KCAL to know that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GIVEN THE noise in the stadium, I checked the parking lot in case
Garrett was sitting in his car with windows rolled up and the radio
on. (I think it would be kind of funny to watch Garrett sitting in a
glass-encased room listening to Rex Hudler broadcast an Angel game,
but that's just me.) I had no idea what Garrett's BMW or Mercedes
looked like, so I checked every vehicle with a Trojan license plate
in the lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you," said Matt Holder, USC class of '93. "We got some
rancid hot dogs here you might like." I could just picture Holder &amp;
Co. packing for the trip to Edison Field -- now don't forget the
rancid hot dogs in case we run into the Page 2 columnist from The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Anderson, still a nice guy, because it was his dad and
daughter who graduated from USC and not himself, said, "Look how much
fun people are having here. Isn't it USC's job to entertain the fans?
Isn't that why they play the game?"</TE>
<TE>   I told Anderson not to accept a hot dog from anyone who graduated
from USC in '93, and then came across Kent Ochiai, class of '83 with
advanced degrees from USC in '87 and '89. He seemed normal, despite
spending all that time there.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so much fun -- it's the best thing to happen locally in
some time, and instead of taking away thunder sticks, USC should rent
some real fans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to hear what Garrett had to say, of course, because I'm
not one to just pounce on the guy for always being clueless. So I
called Garrett's home during the first inning -- just in case I
received a bad tip from USC -- and got him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I COULD not hear the noise sticks in the background, so I wasn't
surprised that Garrett's TV was muted. "I was asleep; you woke me
up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would explain why you're talking to me," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it would," he said, and I know how candid Garrett can be,
but I think I also detected a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GARRETT SAID it was Carroll's idea to put a stop to artificial
noisemakers, I guess Carroll is aware people fall asleep at his news
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about sportsmanship," Garrett said. "A batter has to
only look at a pitcher and try to hit the ball. It's a communication
thing in football, and the visiting team's quarterback can't hear the
plays that are being called."</TE>
<TE>   If a batter can hit a 97-mph pitch with 45,000 people banging
noise sticks together, why can't a quarterback take hand signals from
the sideline under the same circumstances? If a sportswriter can
write a Page 2 column with 45,000 people banging noise sticks
together, he probably deserves a raise.</TE>
<TE>   "You're entitled to your opinion," Garrett said, and I had no idea
the guy was so funny.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for the call," I think he said, and I can't be sure
because the crowd just wouldn't shut up and I was at the game and was
having trouble hearing him.</TE>
<TE>   I'll ask him at the next USC game -- when it's more quiet and we
can talk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jason K.:</TE>
<TE>   "I know you were probably watching the World Series, but did you
notice what happened in the Chargers-Raiders game?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Chargers won the rights to L.A.</TE>

<HD>Game 2: The Night That Time Stood Still</HD>

<LD>In between pitching changes, score updates and replays of Angels and
Giants circling the bases, Fox's Joe Buck took a deep breath Sunday
night and read ad copy for a season-long credit card promotional
campaign: "What did you decide -- what's the most memorable moment in
major league baseball history?"</LD>
<LD>   Right around the 2 1/2-hour mark, around the middle of the fifth
inning, I had my answer:</LD>
<LD>   The final out of Game 2 of the 2002 World Series ... assuming it
would come before the birth of Francisco Rodriguez's first
grandchild.</LD>
<TE>   The Galaxy won a league championship Sunday, playing two overtimes
and 113 minutes before Carlos Ruiz scored the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   After the first 113 minutes of World Series Game 2, the Angels and
the Giants had completed three innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the NFL game that preceded the Angels and Giants (and ran long,
into overtime, forcing Fox to trim its baseball pregame show to 15
minutes), the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 9-6, in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   After 4 1/2 innings, the Angels and the Giants had combined to
outscore them: Giants 9, Angels 7.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's Game 1 victory Saturday drew a record-low
overnight prime-time rating for the World Series opener: 11.2, down
5% from Game 1 of the 2001 Series between Arizona and the New York
Yankees. And that 4-3 Giant win had a lot going for it: the Angels
making their first World Series appearance in 42 years, Barry Bonds
going deep in his first World Series at-bat, former Angel J.T. Snow
returning home to beat the team that traded him six years ago with a
home run and a slip-sliding defensive gem.</TE>
<TE>   Could this have been the reason why?</TE>
<TE>   Time of game: 3 hours 44 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's Game 2 surpassed that by 13 minutes, and surely would
have threatened the World Series record for longest nine-inning game
-- 4:14 -- if not for Angel rookie reliever Rodriguez, just a
20-year-old kid with places to be and people to meet and no time to
spare dawdling on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia mercifully inserted Rodriguez into the
top of the sixth inning and nine Giant batters later, it was the top
of the ninth inning -- time for Troy Percival, one more Bonds home
run and then, at long last, the final out in the Angels' 11-10
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Tim McCarver called it early, long before the first
full-count walk, as he sized up the starting pitching matchup before
the game: "Neither of these pitchers tonight stay ahead of the
hitters. Kevin Appier will be wild low and Russ Ortiz will be wild
high. A lot of deep counts. Does that translate into a long game?
Probably."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels led, 5-0, before Ortiz recorded his third out of the
night.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had cut the deficit to 5-4 before Appier could finish
the top of the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "This game has slowed down to a crawl" McCarver observed just
before Appier staggered to that precious final out.</TE>
<TE>   At the one-hour mark, with the Angels leading, 7-4, with one out
in the bottom of the second, McCarver issued the following
public-service announcement: "This has all the earmarks of the
longest World Series game ever played." That was valuable information
for East Coast viewers, who knew they could safely watch the "The
Sopranos" and come back to the game when the Angels and the Giants
were still in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With time to kill, someone dug up the official figure for Buck.
The record for the longest nine-inning World Series game was set in
1993 by Toronto and Philadelphia in Game 7: 4 hours 14 minutes.
McCarver worked that game and Buck predicted he could remember every
run scored. Of course he could. "Fifteen-fourteen, Toronto," McCarver
said.</TE>
<TE>   No one wanted to go through that again. McCarver began pleading
for "a tourniquet out," for someone to "stop the bleeding." He said
"pitchers from coast to coast are saying, 'Somebody stop this!' And
nobody can."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Percival saved the game, but Rodriguez saved the
broadcast. In a game plodding along in slow motion, K-Rod came in and
pushed the fast-forward button, enabling Tim Salmon to strike his
game-winning eighth-inning home run on Sunday night and not Monday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Two games down, who knows how many more hours to play, but from a
weary TV viewer's perspective, the kid will be tough to beat for
World Series MVP.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Helps Get Angels Off the Hook</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It took 42 years for the Anaheim Angels to reach their first World
Series.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday night, it took another four hours of nail-biting,
back-and-forth baseball for the team to finally earn its first Series
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Fittingly, the winning home run was slugged by Tim Salmon, an
outfielder who had struggled with this team for a decade while
awaiting a crack at the Fall Classic.</LD>
<TE>   Salmon's two-run shot in the eighth inning gave the Angels an
11-10 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Edison Field in Game
2. "That is something I've been dreaming about for a long time," he
said. "It was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   This was a game that looked more like pinball than baseball, the
lead changing hands with dramatic plays on both sides. Every time one
team scored a burst of runs, the other answered. Four hours and 21
total runs. Both starting pitchers gone by the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Series is now even at one game each, with three midweek games
to play at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, but the way the Angels
won, regaining their momentum after surrendering a quick 5-0 lead,
meant something even more to longtime fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to doubt again," said Craig Haugen, 56, of Huntington
Beach, who thought of bygone seasons when the team reached the
playoffs only to stumble. "I shouldn't have because this is a
different team."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, with the home team trailing, the normally
boisterous crowd seemed worried. Pablo Mercado, 26, of Fullerton, who
has been coming to games for 20 years with his father, Jerry, said
the stadium was quiet enough to hear the crack of Salmon's bat.</TE>
<TE>   "You were wishing," Mercado said. "I think everybody's hopes made
that ball go out of the ballpark." And that quickly, Jerry Mercado
said, fans who didn't know each other were hugging like family.</TE>
<TE>   There was still time for a little more suspense in the ninth
inning. With the Angels ahead by two runs, Giant slugger Barry Bonds
hit a solo drive over the right-field wall. Salmon, standing at the
dugout rail, could be seen to murmur: "That's the farthest ball I've
ever seen hit."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Fireworks shot up over centerfield when the game ended, the
pyrotechnics seeming tame in comparison to what had transpired on the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "That might have been entertaining to a lot of people, but it
wasn't entertaining to us," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "That
was a tough ball game."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are used to tough situations by now, having lost the
first game of their three postseason series.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's victory makes it much more likely that the Series will
return to Anaheim, where the hunger for postseason baseball was
evidenced in part by a large number of scalpers selling tickets on
the streets around the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police are investigating the sale of hundreds of
counterfeit tickets that went for as much as $400 each. Dozens of
fans were duped by the fakes, and, when they showed up for the game
Sunday, were either turned away at the gates or escorted away.</TE>
<TE>   TV viewers around the nation were not quite as excited about this
distinctly California matchup. Though Game 1 was the most-watched
show on Saturday night, it brought the lowest overnight ratings for a
prime-time Series game in history.</TE>
<TE>   Not that ratings mattered to Angel fans on Sunday. After the game,
there was an immediate run on Tim Salmon T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   In the clubhouse, the player himself seemed relieved, hitting two
home runs in the game, after struggling at the start of these
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   For so long, Salmon had been dreaming of being a World Series
hero. But come October, he was always lying on the couch, watching
other players get their chance.</TE>
<TE>   All that changed with a swing of the bat. "I knew I got it,"
Salmon said. "I knew the situation. I knew it was big."</TE>

<LD>John Wooden performed the evening's first bit of inspiration by
throwing out the first pitch.</LD>
<LD>   Weak enough to require a cart to take him from the field,

nonetheless threw the pitch without help.</LD>
<LD>   He handed his cane to Angel Manager Mike Scioscia and fired a nice
slow curveball to catcher Jose Molina.</LD>
<TE>   Wooden, who turned 92 last week, then responded to a standing
ovation with a bow.</TE>
<TE>   If only Coach could have stuck around to pitch the second inning.</TE>

<TE>   STOLEN MOMENTS: Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg, Monte Irvin, Jackie
Robinson and ... Brad Fullmer?</TE>
<TE>   By trotting home on the back end of a double steal in the first
inning Sunday -- Benito Santiago had carelessly thrown the ball to
second base -- Fullmer joined those players and others in recording
the 14th steal of home in World Series history.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he should feel too fleet of foot, though.</TE>
<TE>   The last guy to do it, in 1984 for the St. Louis Cardinals, was
that cumbersome TV announcer named Tim McCarver.</TE>

<TE>   EMBRACE THE MOMENT: Tom Lasorda hugging Barry Bonds? It happened
before Game 2 of the World Series at Edison Field as the all-time
Dodger cheerleader embraced the player booed most at Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about surprising sights.</TE>
<TE>   "He and I have always been friends," Lasorda said. "People said to
me, 'What do you think of Barry hitting 73 home runs?' I thought he
was the best player in the National League before that. He's always
been a great player."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds jokingly warned Lasorda "I'll knock you out if you try to
kiss me," laughing with the Hall of Fame manager while reporters
raced to chronicle the made-for-October-TV moment. Lasorda summoned
Santiago to join the show.</TE>
<TE>   No word yet on whether Lasorda plans to hug Angel players before
Game 3 in San Francisco.</TE>

<TE>   X FACTOR: Aaron Sele and Fullmer were key acquisitions, and
Francisco Rodriguez and John Lackey key additions to the Angels this
season, but don't overlook the impact of Jay Lucas, the Angels'
director of publicity and broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas, 45, got his first job in the sports field as a public
relations assistant with the Lakers during the 1981-82 season; the
Lakers won the NBA title that year. In 1988, Lucas took a job with
the Dodgers as an assistant director of publicity; the Dodgers won
the World Series that year.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas joined the Angels in March, and now look at them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's telling me I should market myself to the Chicago Cubs
and Boston Red Sox," said Lucas, known now as "Voodoo Jay" to some
friends. "It just so happens when I started my career or made jumps,
it's been at the right time. It's weird."</TE>

<TE>   FINDING A GROOVE: Don Baylor has never been prouder to be a former
Angel. But he doesn't want to remain a former manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to [manage]," said Baylor, who lost his job as the
Chicago Cubs' manager in July. "I enjoy doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Baylor said he would take a job as a bench coach if he can't land
a manager's gig. He said the San Diego Padres contacted him about a
job as hitting coach, but he wasn't interested.</TE>
<TE>   "The hitting coach ... I've done that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor, who played for the Angels from 1977 to '82, has attended
the first two Series games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've run into a lot of fans that were 8 or 9 years old for that
'79 team," said Baylor, the American League most valuable player as
the designated hitter for that team that won the AL West division.
"That's where 'Yes we can' got started. There's a lot of fans from 23
years ago."</TE>
