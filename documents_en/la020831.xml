<HD>Mozart Concerto Tops Evening of Dances</HD>

<LD>Familiar dance suites by Bartok and Kodaly surrounded equally popular
music by Mozart on the first program in the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra's two-concert visit to Hollywood Bowl on Thursday night.
The second will be given Tuesday, when the ensemble's music director
Jeffrey Kahane again conducts and the horn soloist is Richard Todd.</LD>
<LD>   Bartok's Romanian Folk Dances and Kodaly's Dances of Galanta
showed the chamber orchestra players at their most accomplished,
particularly the Galanta suite, which demands virtuosic playing from
the entire ensemble. Here, the idiomatic and soulful clarinet solo
from principal Gary Gray was especially delightful.</LD>
<LD>   Mozart ruled the evening, first in pianist-conductor Kahane's
at-once bold and seraphic performance of the Piano Concerto in
E-flat, K. 482. Kahane's world-class technical and musical
accomplishments are justifiably admired. His musicianship was more
mellow and conversational than usual, with no loss of urgency in
sweep and spontaneity.</LD>
<TE>   The thrill lies as much in the sounds as in the music-making.
Kahane produces phrasing and musical paragraphs that sing and speak
and articulate thoughts that cannot be translated into words.
Effortless passagework and purling pianistic qualities are Kahane's
trademarks. Long may he play.</TE>
<TE>   The concerto was followed by a lively performance of the Six
German Dances, K. 600.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Chamber Orchestra, Tuesday, 8 p.m., Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N.
Highland Ave., Hollywood, $1-$76. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>'24' Prepares Its Next Day in the Life</HD>
<DH>Television* Producers of the Fox network series reveal a
few secrets about the show's second season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE DUTKA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics loved the fresh approach of the Fox series "24," in which
each episode represents an hour in the frenzied life of
counter-terrorist Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). But it was a
handful to pull off creatively--so much so, in fact, that the show's
creators considered abandoning that format for the coming second
season.</LD>
<LD>   When inspiration failed to strike last spring, executive producers
Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran wrote the first of what they expected
to be a string of "stand-alone" episodes. It would rid them of the
need to mesh plot lines, they told themselves. They'd be free of
mind-bending continuity problems. Best of all, from the actors' point
of view, it would permit costume changes.</LD>
<LD>   Then Surnow and Cochran had an epiphany and decided to continue
the one-hour-per-episode format for the second season. But details
about their vision have been few.</LD>
<TE>   The "24" creators finally unveiled some of their behind-the-scenes
strategizing at a sold-out panel discussion at the Museum of
Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills this week. Appearing with them
were cast members Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert (Sen. David Palmer),
Penny Johnson Jerald (Palmer's wife, Sherry), Sarah Clarke (Nina
Myers) and Elisha Cuthbert (Kim Bauer).</TE>
<TE>   The show will be larger in scope, the producers said. While it
will take into account the post-Sept. 11 climate, there will be no
specific references to the event. And all of the actors who were on
the panel will return this season, beginning Oct. 29. Four episodes
already have been shot. (All 24 episodes of the first season will be
aired on FX in a Labor Day marathon, starting midnight on Sunday and
ending at midnight Monday.)</TE>
<TE>   The day in question for the second season takes place 16 or 17
months after the first season ended. Sutherland's Jack Bauer no
longer works for the Counter-Terrorism Unit. "Oh, yes," Surnow added
with a smile, "Sen. Palmer is the president of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Haysbert stood up, mimicking a politician, soaking up the cheers
of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Another secret unraveled: They showed an alternate ending shot for
the first-season finale. (Not even the cast was privy to which one
would be used.) In the final episode that aired last season, Bauer's
wife, Terry, didn't survive. But in the alternate, she does--Bauer
removes the tape placed over her mouth by a CIA mole, embracing her
and his daughter. The scene, conventional by "24" standards, is
included in a special- edition DVD set for release on Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The creative team ultimately opted for the more brutal denouement
not because of "shock value," Cochran insisted, but because it was
less "heroic" and contrived. Throughout the season, the protagonist
had been flawed--with failures as well as successes, the producers
reasoned. Why copy the feature-film path at this late date, having
everyone ride off into the sunset?</TE>
<TE>   Convincing Fox Broadcasting higher-ups, however, proved a
considerable challenge. The character of Terry was popular--and
pregnant. Entertainment President Gail Berman "almost hung up" during
the conference call in which they pitched the idea, Surnow said.
Still, a few days later, she called Sandy Grushow, chairman of the
Fox Television Entertainment Group, to help them make their case.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the season, the producers said, there was no game
plan--nor guarantees. An audience member, obviously unfamiliar with
how the TV business works, asked whether they had demanded that Fox
commit to 24 episodes because of the name of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "If it worked that way, I would have called the show '110,' " an
amused Cochran shot back.</TE>

<HD>'Mary Lou's Flip Flop Shop' Tries to Help Kids Cope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pint-sized 1984 Olympic gold medal gymnast Mary Lou Retton is still a
diminutive, ferociously perky dynamo. She still does the splits with
ease too, and proves it as host and co-executive producer of a new,
feel-good children's show, "Mary Lou's Flip Flop Shop," launching
Sunday on KCET.</LD>
<LD>   With her trademark wide and toothy grin ever at the ready, Retton
leads song-and-dance numbers, a la Barney, on a colorful, cartoony
set, and interacts with a cast of real kids and goofy costumed
characters--a shaggy orange critter named LZ Bones; Jumpy, a green
monkey; Flip Flop custodian Miss Warble; and bizarrely wigged
deliveryman Mr. Bump, who seems to be channeling Charles Nelson
Reilly.</LD>
<LD>   With grins and yuks galore, many musical numbers and characters,
nutrition and exercise segments, and an overriding, self-conscious
zaniness, the show feels overstuffed. Its core, though, is serious:
helping children understand and deal with emotions when their world
seems to "flip flop."</LD>
<TE>   In each episode, someone has a problem--insecure Jumpy causes bad
feelings when she wants to be first in all the games; one of the
kids' best friends is moving away; another is discouraged over his
chances of making the neighborhood swim team; Mr. Bump feels left
out, not knowing his surprise birthday party is being planned.</TE>
<TE>   Retton, with help from wise owl Professor Blinky (a puppet),
offers perspective, encouragement and solutions appropriate for the
show's target audience: ages 4 to 7.</TE>
<TE>   It's keeping the worthy messages from getting lost in the circus
atmosphere that's the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Mary Lou's Flip Flop Shop" can be seen Sundays at 10:30 a.m. on
KCET.</TE>

<HD>The Not-So-Secret 'Life of Princess Di'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are surely good reasons for CBS airing its latest Sunday night
movie beyond suckering viewers into believing it contains juicy stuff
about the late Princess Diana. But just try to think of one.</LD>
<LD>   "The Biographer: The Secret Life of Princess Di" tells no secrets
in purporting to relate what led Andrew Morton to write his
bestseller, "Diana: Her True Story."</LD>
<LD>   It was published in 1992, five years before Diana's death, making
this junky reworking of old material as contemporary as the redcoats
guarding Buckingham Palace.</LD>
<TE>   One has to be hopelessly Dianaphilic to stay with Joshua Lacey's
vacant, barely ambulatory account that has Morton (Paul McGann), a
reporter for the London Daily Mail, being approached by an
intermediary with Diana's offer to tell him the truth about herself
and her volatile relations with Charles and his family. He never
meets with her, but soon is listening to her tape-recorded words ("My
husband made me feel so inadequate ... in every possible way") that
are delivered to him in installments, surreptitiously.</TE>
<TE>   The royals are on to him, nonetheless. "From now on I shall never
call you at your office," Morton's contact says ominously from a
phone booth, as director Philip Saville tries gamely for suspense
along the lines of "In Defense of the Realm," a tense 1987 thriller
about a snoopy British tabloid reporter who runs dangerously afoul of
nefarious elements inside the British government.</TE>
<TE>   The result, instead, is paralysis, a static hybrid of Diana's
words and news clips of her, along with close-ups of someone's lips
or hands and Morton's tape recorder's red light flashing on and off.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Dunaway is dusted off for a silly cameo as a gossip
columnist, Brian Cox grumbles as Morton's initially skeptical
publisher, and McGann's biographer is traumatized at times by Diana's
taped tales. It's hard getting worked up about him or her, though, in
a movie so inadequate ... in every possible way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Biographer: The Secret Life of Princess Di" airs Sunday at 9
p.m. on CBS. The network has rated it TV-PG-D-L (may be unsuitable
for young children, with advisories for dialogue and language).</TE>

<HD>Judge Gives R. Kelly OK to Travel to Miami</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Friday that R&amp;B singer R. Kelly, who has been free on
bond since he was indicted on child pornography charges, can leave
the state to appear at a nightclub in Miami this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Vincent Gaughan ordered him to surrender his passport
and refrain from any illegal contact with minors.</LD>
<LD>   The Grammy-winning singer was silent during the hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly, 35, whose first name is Robert, was indicted in June by a
Cook County grand jury on 21 counts of child pornography stemming
from a videotape authorities say shows him having sex with a
13-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly says the man on the tape isn't him.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, defense attorney Edward Genson argued that attending
the event was vital to Kelly's livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Kelly, who lives in suburban Olympia Fields, could
be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $100,000.</TE>

<LD>I have one suggestion that I would like to run by the producers of
the CBS movie about Hitler: that before and following each commercial
break, true, historic and graphic footage of the inhuman atrocities
this man caused be shown for 15-20 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, this man had a life previous to his insanity. However,
those who refuse to face the facts of the Holocaust and treatment of
men, woman and children must be shown how this man's brutality ended
so many innocent lives. To let this man's early life be told without
the rest of the story is the worst idea I can imagine.</LD>

<LD>I believe a reviewer has every right to express his or her opinion of
whatever is being reviewed--intelligently, one hopes--but the three
reviews by Manohla Dargis in the Aug. 23 Calendar ("The Clerk as
Creep," " 'Serving Sara' Does No Service to Anyone, Viewers Least of
All," "As Chef Lets Her Hair Down, Who Needs Food as Metaphor?")
sounded more like a failed film school dropout than of a reviewer on
a respected newspaper residing in the film capital of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Denigrating Robin Williams and all of his product is not the sign
of intelligence--it's the sign of a very young, uninformed,
unseasoned smart aleck who erroneously believes that using her entire
bratty vocabulary makes her clever and interesting.</LD>

<TE>   Dargis is a fresh voice who promises to add perspective, insight
and a much-needed, truly critical voice to your newspaper.</TE>

<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I just forced myself to finish the incredibly self-indulgent
review titled "The Clerk as Creep." Perhaps The Times should
reconsider its hire of Dargis. Any movie review that begins with a
300-word dump of the reviewer's baggage about an actor sends up a
warning flag.</TE>
<TE>   Dargis' apparent gift is communicating how her movie-viewing
experience is distorted by every previous exposure she's had to an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the question of how Dargis gained entry to the mind
of Robin Williams. How else could she know that his "fidgety bits of
business," which most viewers would find all of a piece with
Williams' compelling portrayal of a psychotic on the edge, were
actually driven by Williams' need for the audience's devotion?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly The Times would not hire a restaurant reviewer who
divined that the intentions of the chef were pitiful or whose
opinions of a pasta dish were overwhelmed by earlier reactions to
boxes of macaroni and cheese or disdain for cans of spaghetti.</TE>

<TE>   Congratulations on the new movie critic, Manohla Dargis. Her
initial reviews reveal a consummate knowledge of writing, acting and
directing. It is refreshing to read such well-written articles that
not only entertain but also enlighten.</TE>

<TE>   I don't know what's fueling Dargis' complete and utter contempt
for the film world, but I hope The Times' health plan covers therapy,
so she can find out.</TE>

<LD>There is only one Springsteen ("Rock, With Respect," by Robert
Hilburn, Aug. 26). His show at the Forum Saturday night gave his fans
exactly what they needed and wanted: inspiration that we can and will
go on from Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Few, if any, can touch his ability to communicate with audiences.
He is, in effect, a thinking man's evangelist. No pandering or
preaching ... you are on his level and he delivers his message, so we
hear it and believe it. Thanks, Mr. Springsteen.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The continual reminders of the tragedy of Sept. 11 are akin to the
nation acting like a child picking at a scab ("Forget Sept. 11? Just
Try," by Howard Rosenberg, Aug. 23).</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the nation got hurt terribly, but we do not need to dwell on
it night and day for month after month. We had programming at the one
month "anniversary," and when we were still doing special programs of
remembrance at the six-month anniversary, I knew we were going over
the top.</LD>
<LD>   I won't forget Pearl Harbor, D-day, the Oklahoma bombing or any of
the rest. But this country has a multitude of problems to solve, and
the excessive and overdone attention to Sept. 11 is diverting us from
making progress on them.</LD>
<TE>   L. BROWN</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We've all read, watched and listened to every imaginable detail
dug from the rubble of Sept. 11. The media have become hard-pressed
to describe with any originality or fresh insight the horrors of that
day. We, the demanding public, still grasping for any new shred of
information that might help explain how something so wretched could
have occurred, are partly to blame. In truth, what's called for on
the upcoming anniversary is a kind of tribute that's traditionally
allowed for our deepest reflection: a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in the case of our mass media, what I'm suggesting is
nearly unthinkable. But imagine the power of a major network or
newspaper declaring that for 12 straight hours (could we all stand
it?), they would broadcast not a single minute, print not a single
word of news, sports or entertainment. Rather, they would only air or
print a solitary graphic, symbolic of our collective grief.</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine a more courageous act on their part. But, of
course, it will never happen. Why? Because such a decision would earn
them not a single dime.</TE>
<TE>   It might, however, earn back the respect and loyalty of a public
grown increasingly cynical of journalistic excess.</TE>

<HD>Songs of Anger, Patriotism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me get this straight. Songwriters who express anger and
patriotism over the murder of 3,000 human beings on 9/11 elicit yawns
and rolling eyes, while those who distance themselves from such
"extremes of emotion" offer "comfort and perspective" ("Can
Songwriters Convey What Everyone Is Feeling?" by Robert Hilburn, Aug.
28).</LD>
<LD>   Apparently Hilburn has decided that the only tasteful method of
musical expression is employed by Bruce Springsteen, who steers well
clear of any such emotional extremes on his new album, and by Steve
Earle, who would like us to walk a mile in John Walker Lindh's shoes
before judging his inexplicable behavior.</LD>
<LD>   According to Hilburn, artists such as Neil Young, Paul McCartney,
Alan Jackson and Toby Keith have lost "artistic discipline and
judgment" by expressing undiluted emotions in their songs.</LD>
<TE>   I'd be curious to know which event in world history might justify
patriotism or, God forbid, anger.</TE>
<TE>   MIKE ARMSTRONG</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sort of jingoistic nationalism as displayed by Toby Keith is
only one of several reasons why this country finds itself at odds
with the world. Alan Jackson's song isn't quite as obnoxious,
although anyone who wears their ignorance of geography like a badge
of honor needs to get off their tour bus and visit a library.</TE>
<TE>   It's people like Steve Earle who, I believe, represent the true
spirit of America; his is a voice of dissent, a voice that speaks
truth to power. There isn't a whole lot of that around these days as
musicians seem to be telling people what they want to hear as opposed
to what they need to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I put too much stock in what Bono or Springsteen have to
say, but as artists who are commonly portrayed as populists (well,
except at the ticket counter), I think it is especially sad that they
are merely aping the conventional wisdom rather than speaking what
they surely know in their hearts to be true.</TE>
<TE>   ERIC RIFE</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It may come as a shock to Hilburn, but not everyone rolled their
eyes when Paul McCartney sang of his willingness to fight for
freedom. Some of us actually found it a lovely song and a powerful
and much-needed renunciation of the pacifist claptrap his old
bandmate dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing to kill or die for may have seemed to make sense way back
in the pre-9/11 days, but such naive notions pretty much came
crashing down with the two towers. Some of us actually believe Neil
Young had it right in "Let's Roll" when he said, "You've got to turn
on evil, when it's coming after you."</TE>
<TE>   Much too simplistic for Hilburn. Better to celebrate Steve Earle's
ode to a traitor. Now there's a work of real complexity.</TE>
<TE>   I don't blame Hilburn. As a member (however peripheral) of the
arts community, he must scoff at notions as quaint as good and evil,
or face exile. I suppose I should be grateful that the fate of our
country is not in the hands of pop stars and rock critics.</TE>
<TE>   STEPHEN QUINN</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Hilburn for his thoughtful and levelheaded take on Steve
Earle's new work. He's going to need all the support he can get from
the non-reactionary, non-chest-thumping arm of the media (can you
imagine the fun Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are gonna have with
this?). I, for one, will be at Tower Records bright and early on Oct.
8 to pick up my copy, help Steve pay the rent and hear what the most
intelligent songwriter since Dylan has to say about the soul of our
wounded nation.</TE>

<HD>War, Peace and Controversy at L.A. Opera</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was not surprised to read that Los Angeles Opera's anticipated
imported production of "War and Peace" was a "casualty of donor
discord" ("L.A. Opera's 'War and Peace' Casualty of Donor Discord,"
by Diane Haithman, Aug. 23).</LD>
<LD>   However, I was rather astonished at the veiled tone of the
article, with its implications that the blame somehow lies with "Los
Angeles Opera's chief benefactor, Alberto Vilar," and its departed
executive director, Ian White-Thompson, instead of our Teflon-coated
artistic director, Placido Domingo, whose ambitions appear to be
expanding at a greater pace than our funding to support them.</LD>
<LD>   Although White-Thompson was mentioned in the article as "Domingo's
coequal," I don't recall ever seeing his photo splashed on banners or
the season's brochure.</LD>
<TE>   HELEN MAE ALMAS</TE>
<TE>   Bell</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am disappointed by Los Angeles Opera's cancellation of "War and
Peace." But more than that, I am shocked by details in Diane
Haithman's excellent story.</TE>
<TE>   First, what is Los Angeles Opera doing growing its budget 50%
without an endowment? This jeopardizes the very existence of the
company, which was built up from nothing over 14 years when Placido
Domingo's role was advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Second, what kind of administration relies so heavily on one donor
and then causes an airing of the guy's payment delays and health
problems? Wealthy readers won't exactly be lining up to copy Alberto
Vilar, who deserves the gratitude of us all.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, how lame is it for the Domingo administration to cite
"growing pains" as the basis for the cancellation? What they should
be admitting is that they inherited an experienced crew from the late
Peter Hemmings--and proceeded to reinvent things--only with less
savvy.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the impulse to grow. Let's do it without jerking around
the fans or wrecking this fine Los Angeles institution.</TE>
<TE>   ANDREW POWELL</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Swed's commentary ("Turning Opera Minus Into a Plus," Aug.
24) was a bit equivocal and unwarrantedly harsh toward Alberto Vilar,
opera supporter extraordinaire.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, Swed showed a little understanding for the
world's most generous contributor to opera, but on the other hand, he
questioned the terms of agreements of Vilar's gifts, i.e., the
scheduling of payments, with some upfront money and the balance a
year later.</TE>
<TE>   If the opera company can't manage its affairs to accommodate the
donor's terms, then why not just decline his magnanimity?</TE>

<TE>   The lack of $600,000 brings a crisis of sorts to the Los Angeles
Opera. That sum is the difference between staging the
long-anticipated Los Angeles premiere of "War and Peace" and publicly
announcing the withdrawal of backup funds to fulfill an obligation to
the opera audience.</TE>
<TE>   This in a city often touted as the entertainment capital of the
world, a world where actors can command $20 million a picture, etc.
Unfortunately, there is only one David Geffen. Shame on The Industry.</TE>

<LD>Nowadays, the quest for lesbian and gay civil rights is often traced
back to 1969, when patrons of a New York bar, the Stonewall Inn,
resisted a routine police raid. But Sunday's episode of the PBS
lesbian and gay newsmagazine "In the Life" (11:30 p.m., KCET) makes
the case for Los Angeles as the movement's crucible.</LD>
<LD>   The national show is focusing this month's installment on L.A.,
with reports ranging from a visit to Catch One bar, which since the
early '70s has served as a safe haven and community center, to
interviews with Hollywood players Alan Ball (writer-creator of
"American Beauty" and "Six Feet Under") and director Paris Barclay
(1999 Emmy Award for "NYPD Blue").</LD>
<LD>   It is a report from the ONE Institute &amp; Archives' new home (at 909
W. Adams Blvd.) that makes the case for Los Angeles' place in lesbian
and gay history. Attendees at the May 2001 opening of the library,
archive and research center recall the early work of the Mattachine
Society, the Daughters of Bilitis and ONE Inc., which served as
information exchanges in the 1950s and '60s and began to create an
environment in which lesbians and gays found the courage to go public
and demand equal treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles also has been at the forefront in trying to provide a
safety network for lesbian and gay students. A report on Project 10

<HD>Will the Price Be Right to Turn Around Fortunes?</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* With the recording industry in decline,
retailers and labels hope they can revive sales through bigger
discounts.</DH>

<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For consumers, CD prices have looked like an auction in reverse
lately. Want that new Bruce Springsteen or Linkin Park? Here, buy it
for $13.99--no wait, make that $11.99. How about $9.99? Interested in
that hot new band the Vines? Here, take the disc for $6.99. It's not
a CD single; it's the whole album, really.</LD>
<LD>   After years of grumbling that CD prices are too high, music fans
are finding at least some relief from the $18 CD as major retailers
and some record labels turn to discounts to resuscitate their wheezy
business.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the Recording Industry Assn. of America released sales
statistics for the first half of 2002, and the numbers are grim.
Shipments of new music sagged 7% after a decline last year of more
than 5%, numbers that may sound mild but are nothing but bad news for
an industry accustomed to growth since the introduction of the CD in
the mid-1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The trade association also presented a new survey of young music
fans with Internet access. One-third of those fans reported that when
a new song by a new artist catches their interest, the first thing
they do is go online to cop the tune from a file-sharing service.</TE>
<TE>   That groaning you hear is from the music labels and merchants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough market, and it's a hard one to gauge when the new
reality of a price range is 'free' on one end and '$20' on the
other," said Pam Horovitz, president of the National Assn. of
Recording Merchandisers, the trade group for music merchants.</TE>
<TE>   The larger retailers are no strangers to discounting CDs, with
such chains as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Circuit City using selected low
prices to lure customers who might walk out with armloads of DVDs or
new computer equipment.</TE>
<TE>   It's an even more comfortable environment for those discounts now,
though. Two years ago, a Federal Trade Commission inquiry prodded the
recording industry to abandon a practice that authorities said was a
not-so-subtle attempt at price fixing. In essence, the record labels
were punishing the discounters by denying huge advertising subsidies
to any merchants who strayed below certain price levels.</TE>
<TE>   That practice also led Eliot Spitzer, New York state attorney
general, to file a lawsuit in August 2000 against the major labels
and largest retail chains. Twenty-nine other states (California, a
hub of the music industry, not among them) have joined the lawsuit,
which has cited consumer damages of $480 million because of alleged
price fixing. A spokeswoman in Spitzer's office said this week that a
settlement will probably be announced in September.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the record labels that are accused of keeping prices
high have in recent months displayed a new passion for discounting.</TE>
<TE>   Record labels are experimenting with discounts and rebates for key
releases by new artists, an effort to entice and excite consumers.
Hot R&amp;B newcomer Ashanti, for instance, saw her debut album in March
score one of the year's best first-week totals, selling a surprising
502,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Radio airplay was part of the success story, but so was pricing;
her label, Murder Inc./Island Def Jam Records, offered retailers a $2
rebate per disc, so instead of being offered for, say, $15, the
Ashanti album coaxed on-the-fence buyers with prices in the $11 to
$13 range.</TE>
<TE>   That type of splashy debut tactic can have an ongoing effect. Cary
Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the
trade group for the music labels, points out that early momentum
catches the attention of the music press, radio programmers and
retailers making decisions about what their new focus will be, and a
self-fulfilling prophecy kicks in. An album that looks like a hit
becomes a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "But of course, at some point, the music has to hold up or none of
that matters," Sherman said. "You can't make a hit unless the music
is there and people want to hear it."</TE>
<TE>   Within the music labels, the long-standing reluctance to discuss
pricing continues. Executives with such top labels as Sony Music,
Capitol/EMI Records and others declined to be interviewed for this
story despite their recent discounting overtures with new artist
releases.</TE>
<TE>   One executive offered a practical explanation: "You can't convince
people that a CD's cost is driven by the huge expenditures on making,
marketing and maintaining a music career. So defending the pricing is
nothing but a losing proposition."</TE>
<TE>   When the CD arrived in the mid-1980s, many industry voices said
that the new format would be cheaper to produce than LPs and tape
cassettes (and, indeed, it costs about 40 cents to make a CD, and the
packaging adds 25 cents to that) and that the savings would be passed
on to retailers and consumers once the new format was phased in.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, never happened, and the industry had a historic
windfall as fans replaced their vinyl collections.</TE>
<TE>   That profit party was crashed, however, by a consumer revolt
called digital download. Now the music industry, which has long
described its hit albums in terms of platinum and gold, is wondering
how to make CDs a precious metal again. Among some of the approaches
that appear to be headed to stores:</TE>
<TE>   * Best Buy is quietly pushing for $10 to become a more prevalent
price; executives there say prices north of that turn off
casual-interest buyers and send fans to the Internet. Some
competitors, though, say the major retailer is only angling for more
market share or trying to launch another price war that smaller
chains can't fight off.</TE>
<TE>   * The definition of a CD may change. When Interscope Records
released "The Eminem Show," the hottest album of the year, it knew
the music had already been widely pirated online. To fight back, the
label offered the first 2 million buyers a free DVD bundled with the
hit album. Industry observers say packaging and extras are the most
viable way to get kids away from keyboards and back to cash
registers.</TE>
<TE>   * Some retailers are pushing for the single format to become
viable again. Horovitz, the recording merchandisers president, said
retailers would like to see the format or perhaps even four-or
five-song CDs become more meaningful, to give younger consumers a
middle-ground choice between nothing (or a free download) and the
full album. "It's easier to get a song illegally than it is legally
for the kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, tinkering with the price of CDs may have unexpected
downsides. Rand Foster, owner of Fingerprints, an independent music
store in Long Beach, says there is a huge outcry for music labels to
lower the prices of CDs but that, until they do, the retail-driven
discounts create a frustration similar to that of an airline
passenger who finds out the person sitting next to him paid hundreds
of dollars less for the seat.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes people feel like they're getting cheated when they see
that Springsteen CD going for $15 and its throws into question
consumer shopping confidence," Foster said. "They see Springsteen at
$9.99 for a one-day sale, and they don't know that chain is losing
money, a lot of money. There's already a lot of anti-industry feeling
these days and questions about the value of music. And that situation
does not help."</TE>

<HD>'Kilborn' Takes Hearn Sketch Out of Fridge, Apologizes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The producers of CBS' "The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn"
apologized Friday after repeating an episode in which the host
spoofed Lakers announcer Chick Hearn, who died earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the network played an installment of the late-night
show, originally broadcast in mid-June, which featured a comedy
segment in which Kilborn poked fun at Hearn's performance during the
elaborate celebration that followed the Lakers' third consecutive
championship. Hearn had looked frail during the event and at times
seemed flustered, confusing players' names.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the show called the scheduling "an inadvertent
mistake," noting that the producers decided to rerun that particular
episode based on the guests that night, without remembering it
contained the Hearn parody. Producer Rob Burnett issued a statement
saying, "We meant no offense to his family."</LD>
<TE>   There's a dubious upside for CBS; the rerun drew a dismal rating
in Los Angeles, where viewers were most apt to be offended (though
one did complain to The Times). "Late Late Show" was delayed half an
hour, beginning at 1 a.m., due to CBS' U.S. Open tennis highlights.
According to Nielsen Media Research data, the show was watched by
just 0.3% of homes in the local viewing area, or about 16,000 of the
market's more than 5.3 million TV households.</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, NBC's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien"--which
began at its regular time--drew a 3.5 rating, which translates to
186,000 homes.</TE>

<DH>The MTV Video Music Awards honored Michael Jackson, sort
of, and featured an inspiring Springsteen and a belligerent Eminem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Highlighted by a surprise pre-tour appearance by a rejuvenated Mick
Jagger and the Rolling Stones, the 19th annual MTV Video Music Awards
telecast on Thursday ... what's that? That was the Hives? Oh. Sorry.</LD>
<LD>   Sparked by the Who's memorable return to its instrument-smashing
glory, the MTV Video Music ... say what? The Vines?</LD>
<LD>   Let's try this. Climaxed by an amusing spoof of the long-absent
Axl Rose and an imaginary Guns 'N Roses, including a masked guitarist
with a pail on his head, the MTV ... yes? That was Axl and the new
Guns 'N Roses? The guitarist is named Buckethead?</LD>
<TE>   How about Michael Jackson accepting that "artist of the
millennium" award from Britney Spears? That really happened. So what
if MTV explained later that there is no such award--it was Spears who
called him the artist of the millennium.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it: It's futile to try to make much sense of the MTV
Video Music Awards, the hyperactive cable music channel's night to
let it all hang out. As usual, MTV this year crammed everything it
could into the three-hour-plus show, coherence be damned.</TE>
<TE>   The shadow of Sept. 11 could not be ignored, and Bruce Springsteen
&amp; the E Street Band opened the night with "The Rising," his urgent
plea to embrace and transcend the horror of that day. The drama of
the performance was enhanced by its outdoor Manhattan setting at the
Museum of Natural History.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the inspiration, Bruce. Now, back at Radio City Music
Hall. Here's Britney in biker fetish gear. Former New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani introduces Sheryl Crow's somber reflection, "Safe
and Sound"; the two surviving members of TLC weep for the late Lisa
"Left Eye" Lopes; and Shakira shakes her booty.</TE>
<TE>   If the tone was erratic, there were some familiar elements to
latch on to, such as the show's tradition of surprise appearances and
pairings--though this year it has dwindled to the level of David Lee
Roth and Sammy Hagar, making nice after the
front-porch-of-the-rest-home spat they started on their summer tour.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, everyone was on his or her best behavior, except Eminem,
who looked annoyed every time the camera found him. The rapper also
escalated his running feud with Moby, soliciting a hail of boos with
his snipes at the bookish electronic musician ("I will hit a man with
glasses") as he accepted his best male video award.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad this belligerence will remain foremost in many
viewers' minds, because in addition to winning the most awards
(four), Eminem was far and away the most provocative performer on the
show. His "White America," set in what looked like a congressional
hearing room populated by outraged lawmakers, brilliantly described
why the rapper is perceived as such a threat, and he segued into
"Cleanin Out My Closet," a harrowing journey into the tangled strands
of his dysfunctional family.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, it was hit and miss, with the retro rawness of the
aforementioned newcomers the Hives and the Vines (appropriately
staged as a battle of the bands) neutralized by such events as the
first-ever solo appearance by 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake. The word
"historic" was floated in advance of the big moment, but that's
stretching the term for what turned out to be a wan evocation of
Michael Jackson's culture-bending appearance on the Motown 25th
anniversary special.</TE>
<TE>   Now that was historic. Maybe they should rethink that artist of
the millennium thing.</TE>
<TE>   The MTV Video Music Awards will be repeated on MTV today at 1:30
p.m. and Sunday at 11 a.m.</TE>

<LD>Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore could have played it safe. But
they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-six years after they did their last scenes together as the
irrepressible Rob and Laura Petrie on the classic 1961-66 sitcom "The
Dick Van Dyke Show," the two award-winning performers have reunited.
But instead of picking a nostalgic, charming project that would have
their legions of fans letting out a collective sign of joy, Van Dyke
and Moore decided to go dramatic as two unsympathetic residents of a
nursing home in "The Gin Game."</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a labor of love," says Van Dyke with a twinkle of his
blue eyes. "We wanted to do it together."</LD>
<TE>   Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1977 play by D.L. Coburn,
which he adapted for this TV presentation, "The Gin Game" focuses on
the bittersweet relationship that develops between two lonely people
at a rather ragtag old age home through a series of gin rummy games.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyke's Weller Martin, who swears like a stevedore, is the more
accomplished gin player. But he quickly learns that the Bible-quoting
Fonsia Dorsey (Moore) is the more adept player. During the course of
several games, their relationship turns sour as they reveal their
angers, fears and frustrations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gin Game" originally ran on Broadway for 500 performances.
Directed by Mike Nichols and starring the venerable husband-and-wife
team of Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, the play was nominated for
four Tonys, with Tandy winning for best actress. That production was
done for PBS' "American Playhouse" series in 1981. In 1997, Julie
Harris and Charles Durning appeared on Broadway and toured the
country in an acclaimed revival.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dyke-Moore version will air early next year on the public
television series "PBS Hollywood Presents." It was shot on
high-definition video over a hectic 12-day period earlier this month
at KCET Studios in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I am living a blessed life," says Mary Mazur, senior vice
president of programming and production for KCET, about her good
fortune in getting the two stars. "It is not a sentimental play, and
I think if someone was given the task of writing a piece for a
reunion of Mary and Dick, or Rob and Laura, it would be perhaps quite
sentimental. This is a rough piece and goes into some tough issues
about life and how you have chosen to live it."</TE>
<TE>   Though the play is tough, the set was relaxed and fun.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be my shining hour," Moore and Van Dyke sang in unison
between scenes on a recent morning. During a reporter's two-hour
visit, Van Dyke was usually telling jokes or breaking out in song.
Sometimes he and Moore simply sat quietly next to each other as the
crew set up for the next shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He is just crazy about her," says executive producer Ellen M.
Krass, who also was one of the executive producers of the "American
Playhouse" adaptation. "And she's crazy about him. I wouldn't say
she's smitten but it's like he's an older brother. It's a great set,
and everybody has been great."</TE>
<TE>   And both actors look great. Van Dyke, 76, actually is more
handsome now with his white hair and mustache than he was 40 years
ago on his series. Moore, playing about 10 years older than her 65
years, is whippet slim and beautiful even wearing an old lady wig of
white hair and a modicum of makeup. And though they haven't worked
together in more than three decades--the two have appeared on reunion
shows, talk shows and in the 1968 CBS special "Dick Van Dyke and the
Other Woman"--their timing is impeccable as they shoot a
confrontational scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Action," shouts director Arvin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Transferred.' How many Rs are there in the word 'transferred'?"
Moore says sarcastically as she puts down a card.</TE>
<TE>   "Two," Van Dyke responds testily.</TE>
<TE>   "Two? Ha," says Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "Three! What the hell!" he retorts angrily.</TE>
<TE>   As they repeat the scene several times, each take has a different
vitality and venom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Van Dyke saw the original Broadway production, he knew it
would make a perfect vehicle for the two of them. "I said to Mary,
'We'll do it when we are old enough.' "</TE>
<TE>   The play piqued his interest on many levels. "It's kind of a
comedy and then almost immediately they start to bicker like a
married couple. But on the darker side of it I see them as hanging on
to this gin game to keep their cognizance going and not falling into
dementia like everyone else inside they keep talking about. This is
the one thing they are clinging to."</TE>
<TE>   Moore acknowledges their fans may be surprised at the play. "There
is such a tremendous fondness for both of us," she says. "I think
that adds so much to this play. I hope that the audience is prepared
for it. It's not a light comedy, because toward the end you see these
people reveal more and more of themselves and how twisted they are."</TE>
<TE>   Though Brown hasn't previously directed "Gin Game," he was very
familiar with it, having been artistic director of the Long Wharf
Theater in Connecticut when Nichols directed the pre-Broadway
production.</TE>
<TE>   "The exciting thing about doing this material is that, in the
hands of every fine actor, it transposes itself into something
absolutely different," Brown says. "In this case, the two characters
Dick and Mary are evolving are so rich and so totally different than
what Hume and Jessie did. The play is almost like a different play. I
feel because they haven't been married all of those years like Hume
and Jessie, there is a very subtle, dynamic sexuality, a tension that
is under the surface. In a couple of scenes we have already shot
there is a really tremendous sense of romantic possibility between
the two that I think will make it doubly heartbreaking at the end
because each of their baggage gets in the way."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Van Dyke and Moore can explain their chemistry. "I have no
idea how to categorize it," Moore says with a smile. "We are just
Dick and Mary."</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyke recalls the first time he saw Moore arrive on the set of
his series back in 1961. "I said, 'She's so beautiful,' " he recalls
warmly. " 'And she's young.' But, boy, I tell you, within a couple of
weeks we found out what a comedian we had. She didn't know it. She
had never done any comedy and she just had the timing. We just lucked
out with everybody on that show. What a romp."</TE>
<TE>   The two return to the set to start rehearsing a scene in which
Weller and Fonsia get into a heated, almost violent argument. The
scene concludes with Weller shouting a cruel expletive at Fonsia and
storming off the porch.</TE>
<TE>   Moore quickly breaks the tension of the scene: "You've been
wanting to call me that for 40 years," she says to Van Dyke. The
entire crew breaks into laughter.</TE>

<HD>'Small' Is Stunning</HD>
<DH>A single gallery of Ken Price's work traces his road to
brilliant fusion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the artists who have gained prominence since Los Angeles
became an internationally resonant center for new art 40 years ago,
the one whose full-scale retrospective I'd most like to see is Ken
Price.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't just because he's a terrific artist--one whose work is a
brilliant fusion of sculpture with painting, undertaken in the wholly
unexpected medium of ceramics--although he's certainly that. It's
because I don't have a handle on the breadth and depth of so fecund a
practitioner over the course of a long career (he was born in 1935).</LD>
<LD>   Also, art this rich inevitably anticipated a lot of work by other
artists that followed.</LD>
<TE>   "Small Is Beautiful," a new show of Price's drawings at the
University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach, whets the appetite for
more. As the title suggests, it's small--just one gallery, painted
dark turquoise blue, ringed with 45 modestly scaled works on paper.
It's beautiful too.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the work is recent, dating from the last three years, and
much of it is related to the sensuous, even erotic, ceramic vessels
that Price has shown since the mid-1990s and that have created such a
stir. Museum curator Mary-Kay Lombino has also made a judicious
selection of several works from early in the decade, drawings that
give a taste of Price's evolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Unexplained Objects" (2002) suggests what he's up to as an
artist. The drawing is slightly less than 9 inches by 6 inches (small
is beautiful), and color is critical (the drawings are made with
bright acrylics, transparent watercolors, milky gouaches and other
paints). Vertical in orientation (none of the drawings in the Long
Beach show is horizontal), it resists being read as a linear
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   The image shows a peculiar organic lump, painted cheery blue-green
with red polka dots, set in a desert-like landscape beneath a sunset
sky awash in pink, magenta and orange. Hovering high overhead in the
heavens is the tiny black silhouette of a flying saucer.</TE>
<TE>   The UFO and the polka-dot lump are the immediately unexplained
objects of the title although, the longer you look, the more alien
the barren landscape also becomes. Soon, so does the fact of the
drawing itself--art being the quintessential unexplained object. The
cheerful weirdness portrayed here extends to the activity of making
art.</TE>
<TE>   Price's work nudges a mental rearrangement. His art has the
powerful capacity to estrange--to remove us from our common
relationship with the world--but without accompanying feelings of
hostility, despair or indifference. Estrangement is a good thing in
Price's art. He's a master of joyful alienation.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the UFO drawings (there are seven in the exhibition)
shows a flying saucer over a rugged, mountainous landscape in Taos,
N.M. It makes a witty joke about the blissed-out flights of spiritual
fancy--ancient and modern--associated with the region while reveling
in the intoxicating beauty of the place. Next to "Typical Taos
Sighting" hangs a second drawing, titled "Sighting in the Same Area
About a Year Later." It shows the same scene--some things don't
change--even though the landscape, sky and saucer in both are
entirely different in their details.</TE>
<TE>   The show also includes a number of drawings purporting to be
designs for labels for bottles of mescal, the cheap Mexican liquor
made from agave. Rendered in clear, flat colors, the label designs
show simple genre scenes, such as a truck driving through a field of
cactus or a big ceramic jar next to an adobe house with a volcano
smoking in the distance. Shades of a morning-after headache rumbling
within?</TE>
<TE>   There are also a number of talismans--drawings made as good-luck
charms to thwart evil or ward off calamity. "Talisman to Avert
Falling" is the most common theme. Several drawings show a jaunty
little bus careening off a mountain road; another displays a crumpled
car beneath a mountain pass as a giant Day of the Dead skeleton
lumbers into view.</TE>
<TE>   Save for juxtaposition in the exhibition, there's no indication
whether mescal is related to these mundane calamities or to those
Taos sightings, year after year. But in Price's hands, a suggestion
of the magic of altered consciousness functions as warp to the weft
of everyday occurrences. Art is the loom on which they're woven
together.</TE>
<TE>   Price's drawings also help clarify a number of sources exploited
to such good advantage in his painted ceramic sculptures. Vernacular
art, from product labels to tourist trinkets, is one. Cartoons,
especially colorful Sunday funnies and visually rambunctious ones of
the R. Crumb/Zap Comix sort, are another.</TE>
<TE>   So are several types of classical Asian art. Not surprisingly,
given the primary medium in which he works, Price seems attuned to
the decorative patterning characteristic of many Chinese ceramics.
Song Dynasty landscape paintings, in which monumental forms of nature
reduce human figures to minute proportions, also resound. In
"Sculpture in Nature" (2002), a lascivious tongue seems to wiggle
through a mountain pass onto a spreading green lawn. The mountain
looks to be straight from an 11th century hanging scroll by Fan Kuan
or Guo Xi.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteenth century Japanese woodblock prints, with their sharply
detailed contours and dramatic stylization, are especially important
to Price's more recent work, whose images derive from aquatic forms
like mollusks and ocean waves. The drawings "Winter Swell" (1999),
"Small Is Beautiful" (2000) and "Colossal Aquatic Sculpture" (2000)
all bristle with the probing fingers of water so famous in the prints
of Hokusai.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at Price's work, Hokusai starts to seem a likely candidate
to have drawn Zap Comix, had he been around a century later. These
hugely sophisticated little drawings are infused with cross-cultural
beauty, which encourages us to keep on truckin' to Mt. Fuji.</TE>

<HD>NBC and Fox Hire Sitters for the Kids</HD>
<DH>Television* The networks will lease blocks of time for
programs meant to comply with rules for educational or informational
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having chafed for years against a public-service mandate requiring
them to set aside space for children's programming, two major
broadcasters are essentially opting to meet that obligation by
becoming absentee landlords.</LD>
<LD>   NBC and Fox will air Saturday morning programs for kids this fall,
designed to comply with the Children's Television Act, which states
that broadcasters must televise at least three hours of educational
or informational shows each week as a condition of their valuable
broadcast licenses. Yet both networks have abdicated their role in
developing those programs, instead leasing blocks of time to
companies that will produce the shows and sell the ads in exchange
for a flat fee.</LD>
<LD>   NBC struck a three-year agreement with the Discovery Channel,
which will launch a new lineup that includes series derived from its
special "Walking With Prehistoric Beasts" and "The Crocodile Hunter"
in early October.</LD>
<TE>   Fox, meanwhile, generated a bidding war before leasing its
Saturday morning real estate to 4Kids Entertainment--the proprietor
of such Japanese franchises as "Pokemon" and "Yu-Gi-Oh!"--in a
four-year deal valued at $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Premiering Sept. 14, 4Kids' heavily boy-oriented schedule, dubbed
"Fox Box," includes a series based on the video-game character Kirby,
a spinoff of the movie "Stargate," a new version of "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles" for early next year, and a show about
"super-wrestlers" titled "Ultimate Muscle."</TE>
<TE>   Industry observers question whether 4Kids in particular will find
itself pinned under the financial weight of the deal. To succeed,
they say, the company must introduce toy-driven concepts that can
garner millions in merchandising revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Toper Taylor, president of Nelvana Communications, which produces
such children's shows as "Babar" and "Little Bear," said given the
pressure to yield returns in merchandising, "the kids business
becomes a lot more transactional and consumer-products focused."</TE>
<TE>   Al Kahn, chairman of 4Kids Entertainment, insisted advertising
sales were better than expected and that his company should be in a
break-even position from advertising revenue alone, hoping to turn a
profit from video sales and merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kahn noted that when it came to securing precious
shelf space for its programs, 4Kids would no longer be at the mercy
of the networks, which struck increasingly onerous deals with outside
producers as they sought to cash in on the next children's hit.</TE>
<TE>   Executives involved in the deals maintain if they've done their
job right, viewers will have no reason to notice the backstage
changes that have occurred. In fact, they argue the new tenants have
a stronger commitment to kids programming than did the major
networks, who generally viewed the requirement as a financial
albatross.</TE>
<TE>   "We're investing significantly in marketing to kids ... and
promoting the block in a way that hasn't been done for years," said
Discovery Kids General Manager Marjorie Kaplan. "It's a huge win for
the viewer that companies have a stake in building for that
audience."</TE>
<TE>   "We ratchet up the level of competitive choice for kids," Kahn
added.</TE>
<TE>   The new occupants, however, face an uphill battle, challenging
studios with deep roots in the children's arena and sister cable
networks that have already become primary destinations for many kids.
The three heavyweights are Warner Bros., which runs animated
programming throughout the week and has access to a vast assortment
of children's properties (including DC Comics), the WB and Cartoon
Network; the Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC and the Disney Channel;
and Viacom, owner of children's leader Nickelodeon, which draws from
that channel to program CBS' Saturday morning block.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelodeon averaged more than 2 million viewers on Saturday
mornings last season within the key demographic of children age 2 to
11, based on Nielsen estimates. The WB followed at 1.3 million, a 9%
increase from the previous year. Underscoring the shift to cable,
Cartoon Network was third, improving to 880,000 kids, while Fox's
average dropped 20% to 760,000. ABC and CBS each averaged about
750,000, with the former falling 13% year to year while the latter
rose slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings also break down by gender, with most broadcast programs
skewing sharply toward one gender. PBS and Nickelodeon tend to play
more broadly, with shows like "SpongeBob Squarepants" and "Rugrats"
attracting girls and boys.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics question if networks are truly fulfilling the spirit
of their federal obligation by forgoing input in the creative
process. Peggy Charren--the Boston activist who founded Action for
Children's Television, whose lobbying led to the Children's
Television Act--suggests the commercial networks had already watered
down the act's wording to the point where anything could be labeled
"educational," rendering the guidelines all but meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   As for the migration of children to cable, Charren points out that
roughly a quarter of homes still don't receive those channels, which
has inspired her to focus on safeguarding funds for public
television--the last broadcast haven for educational fare.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the economics of television watching, in terms of the haves
and have-nots, we still have to worry about," she said. "It's the
poor kids that get the short end of the stick, and that's still
happening in children's television."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Friedman, executive vice president of Kids' WB, which has a
new version of "Scooby-Doo" in its arsenal, contends that children
are well-served by the programming available and the new entrants
will add to that.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I think it will be more competitive. Both have invested
a lot of money in the time slot and need to make it work," she said,
adding that children's programmers have "really raised the bar" in
terms of quality. (The WB is partly owned by Tribune Co., owner of
the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, Nelvana's Taylor noted that breakout hits have
traditionally arisen from unexpected sources that took creative
risks, as opposed to just plugging shows into a predetermined mold.
Whether that can happen as readily under a more corporate approach,
with networks leasing out time, remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just formulize kids TV," he said, "and I worry about
that happening on a consumer level over the next few years."</TE>

<LD>   O'Reilly Fending Off Conservative Critics</LD>
<LD>   Though he eschews the label himself, Bill O'Reilly has ridden to
fame for views that appeal to conservative viewers of Fox News
Channel, where his show "The O'Reilly Factor" airs. So some of them
were caught by surprise--and angered--when he gave an interview to
the gay-themed magazine the Advocate supporting gay rights and
recommending that "fanatical" anti-gay activists be ignored.</LD>
<TE>   Postings on an Internet Web site operated by Concerned Women for
America, for example, suggested O'Reilly was confused on the issue
and was an example "of the American Christian who does not know what
God's word said."</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly used his show Thursday night as a platform to respond to
the critics.</TE>
<TE>   "My stance is simple," he said. "We're all Americans here. Nobody
should be discriminated against. I'll leave it to God to figure out
who's going to hell and who isn't. I'm not qualified, and nobody else
on Earth is either."</TE>
<TE>   More Americans Sit in Front of the Tube</TE>
<TE>   The national TV audience will grow again next week, as Nielsen
Media Research issues revised population estimates for the 2002-03
television season.</TE>
<TE>   The pool of U.S. viewers, age 2 and over, is now pegged at 272
million, up slightly more than 2 million (or less than 1%) compared
to the previous TV season. The number of households with television
also rose, to 106.7 million from 105.5 million. Each rating point
represents 1% of that total.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen revises its estimates annually based on research and
census data. Population growth over the years has helped offset
steady losses by the major networks in terms of the percentage of
viewers they reach.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Another Guggenheim on Gehry's Project List?</TE>
<TE>   First New York City and Venice. Then Berlin and Bilbao. Can
another Guggenheim be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates, the Los Angeles-based firm behind the
Bilbao project, has been approached to build a similar site near the
Leath docks in Edinburgh, Scotland. A representative of the firm told
the newspaper the Scotsman that the area "was appropriate if a
Guggenheim were to be established in the U.K."</TE>
<TE>   The site of the proposed Guggenheim--a 200,000-square-foot area
similar in size to Bilbao's--is owned by Forth Ports, whose property
director, Terry Smith, indicated interest in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Guggenheim, with permanent homes in New York and Venice, began
to expand in 1992 with the restoration of its Frank Lloyd Wright
building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the opening of a new
branch, now closed, farther downtown. Realists point out that the
Edinburgh proposal is far from a fait accompli. A lot of cities are
wooing the Guggenheim, they point out, and the museum's financial
fortunes are sagging.</TE>
<TE>   Cambodian Treasures Uncovered by Workmen</TE>
<TE>   Cambodian workmen, restoring a pagoda destroyed by the Khmer Rouge
regime in the 1970s, have discovered 27 solid gold Buddha statuettes
buried for hundreds of years under the structure's foundation in the
jungles near Phnom Penh. Construction work came to a stop when they
retrieved the pieces, each about 4 inches tall.</TE>
<TE>   The find is stirring up controversy between locals who want the
statues to be placed in a special shrine inside the pagoda and
government officials who want them in a museum. Monks and nuns
celebrated the find with three days and two nights of religious
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Another find that also made the headlines: Two 2,000-year-old
bells were also retrieved in the Phnom Penh region and sent to
Cambodia's National Museum for restoration and safekeeping. Made
about 300 BC, they were originally thought to be unexploded artillery
shells or bombs--and were very carefully unearthed.</TE>

<TE>   Local Firm Building Montreal Studio</TE>
<TE>   So much for Gov. Gray Davis' proposed financial incentives to keep
film production at home. A Los Angeles firm has announced plans to
build a $40-million studio near Montreal for big-budget pictures.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, WonderWorks Entertainment--a
provider of film sets and special effects for studios such as
LucasFilm, Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal--and its associated
production company, Avondale Pictures, plan to start constructing a 4
million-square-foot facility in April. In addition to 210,000 square
feet of sound stage, it will have pre-and post-production capacities.</TE>
<TE>   The infrastructure of the Montreal film industry, the low Canadian
dollar and financial incentives from the Quebec government were the
reasons for locating in that city, said Wonderworks president John
Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Tim Burton, who directed the films "Batman" and "Batman Returns,"
is now attached to the Broadway-bound "Batman: The Musical," which is
planning an out-of-town tryout in 2004, according to the New York
Post. Warner Bros. is said to be set to produce the project.... TBS
has given the title role in "America's Prince: The John F. Kennedy
Jr. Story" to up-and-coming actor Kristoffer Polaha ("Petty Crimes").
Daryl Hannah will be played by Tara Chocol, who has appeared on HBO's
"Sex and the City." ... Columbia Pictures is embarking on an
English-language remake of the Oscar-nominated Argentine film "Son of
the Bride," the tale of a man who grapples with his past. Adam
Sandler will star.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Taps GE Executive to Be Its CFO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amazon.com Inc., the world's largest Internet-based retailer, named
General Electric Co.'s Thomas Szkutak chief financial officer and
senior vice president.</LD>
<LD>   Szkutak, 41, spent more than 20 years at General Electric, the
world's biggest company by market value, and most recently was CFO of
the GE lighting unit. He will join Amazon.com in the next few weeks,
the retailer said. Szkutak replaces Warren Jenson, 45, who left in
June.</LD>
<LD>   Amazon.com has added technology to improve customer service and
trim operating expenses. Cost cuts by Jenson, who also worked for
General Electric, helped the retailer post its first-ever profit in
the fiscal fourth quarter amid the worst holiday shopping season in
six years. Companies such as 3M Co. and Home Depot Inc. have hired
from GE, which is known for its efficiency.</LD>
<TE>   "The new guy seems to have inherited a company in a relatively
strong financial position and moving in the right direction," said
analyst Derek Brown of WR Hambrecht &amp; Co., who rates Amazon.com's
shares "buy" and doesn't own them.</TE>
<TE>   Jenson was CFO of GE's NBC broadcast unit from 1992 to 1998. He
now is chief financial officer of Redwood City, Calif.-based video
game maker Electronic Arts Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon shares fell 23 cents to $14.94 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>American Tightens Ticket Policy, Adds $100 Fee for Standby
Flights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines added a $100 fee for passengers with
nonrefundable tickets who want to take another flight on standby, as
the world's largest carrier tries to stem losses.</LD>
<LD>   The change is for tickets in the U.S. and Canada issued for travel
on or after Jan. 1, the airline said.</LD>
<LD>   American also is requiring passengers with nonrefundable tickets
for U.S. flights to make any changes on or before the departure date.
Such tickets will have no value after the departure date, the airline
said.</LD>
<TE>   The moves will enable American to reduce costs and compete with
discount rivals, the Fort Worth-based airline said, without providing
details.</TE>
<TE>   AMR shares fell 29 cents to $10.19 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. They have declined 54% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Major U.S. airlines are raising some ticket fees and tightening
restrictions to cut costs and increase revenue after losses of more
than $3.8 billion in this year's first half.</TE>
<TE>   This week UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it was tightening rules
on upgrades and fare discounts and raising its fee for paper tickets
to $20.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways Group Inc., flying under bankruptcy protection,
increased its paper-ticket fee to $25.</TE>
<TE>   The company, the country's seventh-largest carrier, said it would
cut about 200 mainline US Airways flights and 100 daily US Airways
Express commuter flights by Nov. 2 to reduce service to match lower
demand.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier's plan to eliminate the flights, which account for
about 13% of its daily schedule, was announced Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Aug. 11, saying
it was unable to reach agreement for cost reductions with some
creditors, vendors and lessors.</TE>
<TE>   The company had sought $1.3 billion in annual savings to
restructure the airline outside of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares rose 9 cents to 70 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Says Goodbye to Accounting</HD>
<DH>Audits: Once one of the Big Five, the firm stops practicing
in all states today. But it vows to remain 'an ongoing business
entity.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the party guest who leaves long after the festivities have
ended, Arthur Andersen officially exits the public accounting
business today, leaving a shell of a company that was once an
industry icon.</LD>
<LD>   With its client base and its sterling reputation now just visions
in the rear-view mirror, the first major accounting firm to be
convicted of a felony hangs on in skeletal form, its global network
that once boasted 85,000 employees reduced largely to mop-up crews in
a few offices.</LD>
<LD>   "As a practical matter, Andersen no longer exists as an auditing
firm," said Rusty Hardin, the private attorney who defended Andersen
on obstruction-of-justice charges in the spring. The firm was
convicted June 15 in connection with its shredding of documents for
Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "By the time of sentencing [in October] they'll be down to 16
partners, out of 1,700 [U.S. partners]. It will be a firm of, at
most, several hundred people," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   And, added one source, "they've got litigation coming out of their
ears."</TE>
<TE>   After its conviction, the firm founded in 1913 by Northwestern
University accounting professor Arthur Andersen agreed to cease
providing auditing services for publicly traded companies as of
today.</TE>
<TE>   And conceding that the jury verdict effectively ended its audit
practice, the firm also opted to surrender, by today, its licenses in
all 50 states to perform CPA services for companies public or
private.</TE>
<TE>   Even with its overseas network largely dissolved and its U.S.
ranks thinned to less than 3,000 (from a high of 26,000) Andersen
will remain "an ongoing business entity," said Patrick Dorton, a
company spokesman. But he and others within the company declined to
specify exactly what it will be doing.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said the firm will still reap revenue from renting out a
former Catholic college campus Andersen owns on the banks of the Fox
River in St. Charles, Ill., about an hour west of the firm's U.S.
headquarters in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Described by one visitor as an "absolutely gorgeous campus," the
facility had been used to hold training sessions for Andersen
employees. Now it will be leased out to corporate customers, Hardin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That revenue will look like nothing, $20 [million] to $30 million
if they're successful," he said. That pales in comparison with the
$4.3 billion pulled in by Andersen's North American operation last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those missing millions will now flow to former Andersen
competitors--Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte &amp; Touche
and KPMG, known as the Final Four--that have been busy snapping up
Andersen assets since the company was indicted in March.</TE>
<TE>   This week Andersen Worldwide, the umbrella organization for the
international offices, announced plans to pay nearly $60 million to
creditors, employees and shareholders of Enron, hoping to shield the
other global offices from litigation. Arthur Andersen, the U.S.
partnership, was not part of the two settlements, Dorton said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the spring, the U.S. and worldwide branches have taken great
pains to assert their independence from each other.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. arm is being run by an administrative council made up of
at least four partners in Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles,
sources said. Offices in those cities, and in Houston, home of Enron,
were still functioning this week at some level, albeit with a greatly
reduced staff and with an unclear life expectancy. Nearly all other
U.S. offices have been closed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's small, fewer than 100 people, and there were more than a
thousand here 90 days ago," said a company official describing the
downtown Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chicago office is basically a skeleton crew," said Allan D.
Koltin, an accounting consultant who is a frequent visitor to
Andersen's U.S. headquarters. "You've got a handful of people and
everyone's been consolidated onto one floor."</TE>
<TE>   Despite widespread speculation the company will file for
bankruptcy protection, company officials have said they do not intend
to do so. Two weeks ago, Andersen filed a three-page motion in the
U.S. District Court in Houston, saying that "it has not adopted any
plan of dissolution and does not intend to dissolve on Aug. 31 or
thereafter."</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that the firm was headed for bankruptcy was fueled in
part by Andersen's decision in March to hire Bryan Marsal as its
chief restructuring officer. Marsal, who has worked extensively with
bankrupt companies, has declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Bowman, editor of the Atlanta-based Bowman's Accounting
Report, said he thinks "the firm is ultimately heading toward
bankruptcy" but said the company may be putting off that course as
long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. bankruptcy law, deals struck by an insolvent company to
sell assets up to a year before the filing could be voided if a
bankruptcy judge determined that the deals were designed to channel
money away from creditors.</TE>
<TE>   That the firm may delay filing to ensure the safety of some of its
deals "is certainly a possibility," said Christopher Patti, counsel
for the University of California, the lead plaintiff in a
class-action lawsuit filed against Andersen and others by Enron
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen seems to be hanging on, though obviously it's in severe
financial difficulty," Patti said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Brandt, president and chief executive of Development
Specialists Inc., a Chicago-based restructuring firm, predicted in
May that the firm would file for bankruptcy protection within a
month. He said Friday that the "day of reckoning" for Andersen had
been postponed because courts have refused to "sequester or embargo
any of Arthur Andersen's assets" as a hedge against any future
judgments.</TE>
<TE>   As the company awaits sentencing Oct. 11, the key issues are
paying down debts, trying to get out of leases for now-shuttered
offices and selling remaining assets, including practices, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring firms have been paying Andersen, on average, more than
$100,000 per partner--who typically bring with them a roster of
clients, sources familiar with the deals said. In one of the largest
transactions, Deloitte &amp; Touche in the spring acquired 2,000 people,
including almost 200 partners in the tax practice.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman said the industry transition from five major players to
four "actually has not been chaotic." Rival firms seeking to acquire
an Andersen audit or tax team have typically negotiated the deal
through the Chicago office.</TE>
<TE>   There is a big incentive for companies to keep the audit team
because switching to a new firm can double the costs for the first
year, said Mark Cheffers, chief executive of
AccountingMalpractice.com.</TE>
<TE>   There are other options for the firm, including consulting and
non-CPA tax work. But although the company has vowed to appeal the
verdict after sentencing, even Hardin agreed a reversal would not
make the company whole again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an appeal to set the record straight," Hardin said, "and
give the employees a chance to not be considered felons."</TE>

<HD>Boeing's Machinists Call a New Vote</HD>
<DH>Labor: With the contract set to expire Sunday and the
threat of a strike looming, members say they were confused about the
initial ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN JUNG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Boeing Co.'s biggest union will vote again on management's latest
contract proposal because of confusion among workers about the
initial ballot, union officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The machinists union, which is seeking bigger pensions and
stronger job guarantees, voted Thursday on what the huge airplane
manufacturer calls its "best and final" offer and on whether to
authorize a strike.</LD>
<LD>   But workers said they cast their votes without knowing what they
were supposed to do after the current contract expires at midnight
Sunday. That prompted the union to seal the results and call a new
vote.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of confusion out there with our membership," said
Mark Blondin, president of the Machinists District 751.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome is likely to determine whether the union's 25,000
members at Boeing plants in Washington state, Portland, Ore., and
Wichita, Kan., go through with a walkout.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing spokesman Chuck Cadena said the company would respect the
results of a second vote and said one should be held as soon as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Blondin said members had complained of confusion during Thursday's
vote, after a federal mediator asked the union and Boeing to resume
negotiations and extend the current contract.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union quickly agreed, Boeing refused; the company
says it will not budge from its last offer.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Boeing's negotiators agreed Friday to meet with the
director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service at 9 a.m.
Wednesday in Washington, D.C. But the company plans only to explain
the rationale behind its final proposal and will not participate in
further contract talks with the machinists, Cadena said.</TE>
<TE>   The union intends to meet with the mediator Wednesday in hopes
that Boeing will have changed its mind on further talks. If Boeing
refuses, the union will vote again on the standing offer. No date for
the vote has been set.</TE>
<TE>   "To ensure that every member is again given an opportunity to
express their true opinion, we will revote," Blondin said.</TE>
<TE>   Union members will continue to work after the contract expires,
union leaders said, putting off the threat of a strike. Boeing said
employees are welcome to return to work under terms of the existing
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Machinists had been seeking to more than double pensions and to
secure job guarantees linked to aircraft deliveries, revenue or other
business benchmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's final offer would have raised pensions by 20% by the
third year of the contract and included no substantial changes to its
job security contract language, inciting union leaders whose
membership has been slashed by 25% since Sept. 11 because of
companywide layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The company's contract offer also calls for changes in employee
health-care costs, including increases in monthly premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing offered an 8% ratification bonus for accepting the
contract, and raises of 2% and 2.5% in the second and third years of
the contract.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Spend in July at Fastest Pace in 9 Months</HD>
<DH>Economy: The 1% jump comes despite plunging confidence and
little growth in income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BURROUGHS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. consumers, undaunted by their nagging anxiety about the economy
and motivated by free financing on cars and merchandise discounts,
spent in July at the fastest pace in nine months--surging a full
1%--even as personal income stalled.</LD>
<LD>   Personal spending rose twice as fast as the 0.5% increase posted
in June, the Commerce Department said Friday. The jump came despite
plunging confidence amid big stock market losses and corporate
scandals. It was the biggest gain since October, easily beating
forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   A 3.7% advance in spending on durable goods drove the gain, mostly
on the back of stronger auto sales spurred by no-interest financing
and other incentives</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a key gauge of Midwest manufacturing from the National
Assn. of Purchasing Management-Chicago rose more than expected in
August to 54.9, partly reversing a sharp drop in July.</TE>
<TE>   The index posted its seventh straight month of growth, soothing
fears of a sharp pullback in the sector.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's data pointed to an economy struggling to get to full
speed but unlikely to slip back into recession as some economists
feared a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Glassman, senior U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, said if
a national manufacturing survey, to be released next week, also shows
a rebound, "all those worries about a double-dip recession have to be
set aside."</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Supply Management's August survey on U.S.
manufacturing is due Tuesday and is considered critical for the
economic outlook. It also posted a steep fall in July.</TE>
<TE>   Other data this week showed record new-home sales and a big jump
in durable goods orders, but unemployment claims still rose.</TE>
<TE>   "This week's news is suggesting final demand is doing pretty well
this summer. The only thing that's missing from this picture is job
growth," Glassman said.</TE>
<TE>   The July spending increase came even though consumer sentiment
fell for a third straight month. The University of Michigan August
index slipped to 87.6, from 88.1 a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The final August current conditions index edged lower to 98.5,
from 99.3 in July and a mid-month reading of 100.2, while the
expectations index, which tracks attitudes about the 12 months ahead,
slipped to 80.6 in August from 81.0 in July but was above the
preliminary reading of 80.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we have seen in the past year is that consumers
continue to be worried about the economy, but they still seem to be
spending," said Steven Wood, chief economist at Financial Oxygen in
Walnut Creek, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Resilient consumption has encouraged Federal Reserve officials to
take a cautiously optimistic view of the economy, saying that
interest rates at 41-year lows of 1.75% should be enough to keep the
recovery on track.</TE>
<TE>   Still, income growth was unchanged after June's revised 0.7% gain,
the weakest since November 2001 and below forecasts for a 0.2% rise.
All of this reflects a stagnant job market, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Without steady income gains, it will be difficult for consumers to
maintain July's pace of spending, economists warned.</TE>
<TE>   Wages and salaries, the biggest source of income growth, fell
0.2%, the first drop since April.</TE>
<TE>   With spending strong and income flat, the personal savings rate
edged down to 3.4% of disposable income, the lowest level since
December.</TE>
<TE>   "The income number is very important, because income will drive
spending going forward," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of
America Capital Management in St. Louis. "Job and wage growth will
remain the driver of spending going forward. But a continued pace of
spending faster than income growth is not sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed tame inflation, according to the Fed's
favorite measure.</TE>
<TE>   The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at a
1.2% rate in July, compared with a year earlier, up from 1% in June.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding food and energy, the year-over-year gain was 1.4%, down
from 1.6% in June.</TE>

<HD>Stock Funds Post Record Outflow</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Investors pulled $52.6 billion from mutuals in
July, a trade group says. Bond funds set new marks, taking in a net
$28.1 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors, as predicted, pulled a record dollar sum from stock mutual
funds in July as the market dived to five-year lows and fear levels
soared, a new report shows.</LD>
<LD>   But the surprise to some analysts is how quickly investors began
buying equity funds again, once the market rallied in late July.</LD>
<LD>   Some major fund companies say their stock funds will show net cash
inflows for August, though the industry overall may still record a
modest outflow.</LD>
<TE>   In July, stock funds suffered a net cash outflow of $52.6 billion,
according to a report released Friday by the Investment Company
Institute, the funds' chief trade group.</TE>
<TE>   That was the biggest monthly net outflow in dollar terms in the
industry's history, surpassing the $30 billion that exited stock
funds in September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But as a percentage of total stock fund assets, the July outflow
was 1.7%, the institute said. That was far below the 3.2% net cash
outflow from equity funds in October 1987, when the market suffered
its worst one-day crash in history.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at 1.7% of assets the July cash outflow was the second-
biggest ever.</TE>
<TE>   Fund net inflows and outflows are measured by subtracting
redemptions and exchanges from new purchases each month.</TE>
<TE>   In July, new purchases of fund shares increased from June despite
the market's woes: Investors bought $72.7 billion in stock fund
shares in July, up from $67.1 billion in June.</TE>
<TE>   But redemptions by fleeing investors rocketed 32% in July, to
$102.6 billion from $77.8 billion in June.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other investors were exchanging stock fund shares for
shares of bond funds and money market funds within the same fund
company. Exchanges yanked a net $22.7 billion from stock funds in
July, up from $7.6 billion in June.</TE>
<TE>   As many investors sought securities they perceive to be safer than
stocks, bond mutual funds had a record net cash inflow of $28.1
billion in July, the institute said.</TE>
<TE>   Money market funds took in a net $54.6 billion in July.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of July, stock funds held a total of $2.77 trillion in
assets, while bond funds held $1.35 trillion and money market funds
held $2.25 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   With the surge in fund redemptions, some analysts questioned
whether the industry might be at the beginning of an extended wave of
selling by investors fed up with the long bear market. But as equity
prices rebounded in late July and early August, buyers returned.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard Group, the second-biggest fund company, estimated that
its stock funds would see a net cash inflow of about $350 million in
August, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Investments, the biggest fund company, said stock fund
purchases and sales were running about even for the month, spokesman
Vin Loporchio said.</TE>
<TE>   At T. Rowe Price Associates, spokesman Steve Norwitz said,
purchases held up in August while redemptions tumbled, producing
"very good" cash inflows for stock funds. "I'm frankly surprised that
the money has come back in August," Norwitz said, citing the fear
level in the market in July.</TE>
<TE>   Don Cassidy, analyst at fund industry tracker Lipper Inc. in
Denver, said the July sell-off may have been so intense that it
"cleaned out people who might have sold later," whether the market
had rallied or fallen further.</TE>
<TE>   But Cassidy said many of the investors who have shifted money out
of stocks and into bonds and "cash" accounts may not soon return
those dollars to equity funds.</TE>
<TE>   "To the degree they're buying bond funds, that probably represents
a long-considered decision" to lighten up on stocks in favor of a
potentially safer asset, Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that money will be out of reach of stock funds for a
while."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the fund industry has mostly enjoyed net cash inflows to
stock funds since the bear market began in March 2000. That is partly
a function of automatic investing plans--such as 401(k) retirement
savings accounts--in which many investors continue to favor stocks,
taking a very long-term view of the market.</TE>

<DH>Retailers make a big push for back-to-school spending on
high-tech gadgets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents say they're reining in their back-to-school spending this
year, but that isn't deterring long-suffering retailers from pushing
high-tech gadgets as this year's "must-have" back-to-school items.</LD>
<LD>   Struggling to sell clothing and pencils to students and
electronics to adults, many retailers are hoping to solve both
problems by redoubling efforts to pitch personal digital assistants,
cell phones and computers as educational tools for teens.</LD>
<LD>   Even as color-screen digital organizers and glittery metallic cell
phones grow in popularity and come down in price, however, consumer
electronics still could prove to be a tough sell this fall.</LD>
<TE>   Parents on average say they plan to spend less this year on
back-to-school items than they did last year, according to two new
national surveys, the first time in a decade that parents have failed
to up the annual fall ante. Consumer confidence this month slipped to
its lowest level since November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many students already have a full array of electronic
goods, analysts say, making it easier for parents to decline to
upgrade to the latest models.</TE>
<TE>   "He and all his friends already have cell phones--now he says he
needs a better one, with a two-way pager and games," said Rhonda
Spearman, 44, as she and her 13-year-old son examined giant bins of
pens and pencils at a Target store in Southwest Los Angeles. "They
don't need it, and it's not economical."</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't deterring retailers from making a big push for
back-to-school gadgets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing more circulars, more ads and more promotions," said
Tom Edwards, an analyst with the Techworld division of market
research firm NPD Group. "I think it's grasping for some reason to
promote, some event to help stimulate the sales."</TE>
<TE>   Those sales were tough to come by this summer, particularly in
consumer electronics. Technology sellers got hit hard in July, a
result of stock market jolts and tough comparisons to last year, when
tax rebate checks funded a spurt in spending, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen nothing from the retailers suggesting that any July
malaise went away in August," said Matt Fassler, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New York. "Parents, being consumers like the
rest of us, are pulling back on discretionary spending."</TE>
<TE>   Although overall spending was better than expected in July, most
of that growth came from purchases of durable goods with discounted
financing, such as cars and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   For many retailers, however, hope springs electronic.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Circuit City newspaper insert, headlined "Get in gear for
school, for work, for fun," featured hand-held electronic organizers,
computers, MP3 music players and even a video game console--"all the
on-campus essentials."</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City spokesman Bill Cimino said the company chose which
products to highlight after interviewing returning college students
about their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Back-to-school is one time where we show families how these
products can work in their lives today and revolve around school," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Internet users, meanwhile, have been bombarded with e-mails,
pop-up ads and online shopping guides promising to "keep students
plugged in" with cell phones, computers and stereo systems.</TE>
<TE>   For many retailers, the response so far has been less than
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy Co., the country's largest seller of consumer
electronics; Massachusetts-based Tweeter Home Entertainment Group
Inc.; and Denver-based Ultimate Electronics Inc. each has said
recently that weak sales would mean lower-than-expected quarterly
earnings. RadioShack Corp. specifically cited a significant slowdown
in August sales as the reason for reducing its quarterly earnings
guidance.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday afternoon just days before the beginning of school,
Jennifer Knobel, 17, was the lone shopper browsing among laptop
computers at a Southland Circuit City--and only because USC requires
the machine for Jennifer's architecture classes, her mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just doing whatever is necessary," said Magaly Knobel, who
traveled from Moraga, Calif., with her husband to help their daughter
get settled. "I don't think you need everything."</TE>
<TE>   Mothers shopping at Target last week concurred. Lorie Benjamin,
during a brief break in her hunt for notebooks and pens, said
11-year-old Shannon asked for a cell phone "for school" at Holy Name
of Jesus in Los Angeles. Benjamin, however, wasn't buying.</TE>
<TE>   "She's getting straight school supplies, the stuff on the
list--and not even all of that," Benjamin, a 44-year-old employee
with the city of Los Angeles, said of her daughter. "What does any of
that high-tech stuff have to do with school? How is it going to put
my child on the honor roll?"</TE>
<TE>   In its poll of parents of teenagers, Capital One Financial found
that parents nationwide planned to spend an average of $97 on school
supplies, down from $118 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Another survey, by market research firm America's Research Group,
recorded the lowest back-to-school spending total in 10 years, with
parents planning to spend an average of $302.11 for all their
back-to-school products, down from $336.48 last year. Of those
surveyed, 86% said they would buy fewer items this year, and 14% said
they planned to buy cheaper products.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it may be too soon to tell if electronics sales are a
bust this season, said Edwards of NPD Techworld. What parents say
they plan to buy and what they dobuy are often vastly different, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we worried that Christmas would be a washout after
Sept. 11," he said, "and it turned out to be one of the strongest
Christmases ever for consumer electronics."</TE>

<HD>Genelabs Surges on FDA Letter</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Its shares jump more than 100% after
regulators say its drug to treat lupus is 'approvable.' The agency
wants an additional trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of a California biopharmaceutical company more than doubled in
price Friday after the Food and Drug Administration issued a
favorable letter on what could become the first new treatment in 40
years for the chronic and debilitating disease lupus.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA said that Prestara, produced by Redwood City-based
Genelabs Technologies Inc., is "approvable," which means the drug can
proceed to the next step on its way to possible final approval. In
this case, the FDA said it wants an additional six-month clinical
trial focusing on the drug's effects on bone mineral density.</LD>
<LD>   The news drove up Genelabs stock $1.43, or nearly 103%, to $2.82
on Nasdaq. Company President James A.D. Smith said it was too soon to
predict when the trial would get underway.</LD>
<TE>   Genelabs has been seeking FDA approval for Prestara (formerly
known as Aslera or GL701) since the company turned in a new drug
application in September 2000. But the company struggled to prove its
effectiveness versus more common therapies and received a "not
approvable" letter from the FDA last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has filed new information that might have
been crucial, according to experts on the disease. That information,
according to the company and to disease experts, involved the fact
that Prestara demonstrated an ability to build bone mineral density
in lupus patients who were using prednisone, the traditional therapy.
Prednisone, a corticosteroid, has the severe opposite effect on bone.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor, said a source close to the FDA process, was that
FDA officials who are more familiar with the disease now are in
charge of the application.</TE>
<TE>   Lupus is an autoimmune disease and in its most serious form,
systemic lupus erythematosus, it attacks the tissues of the lungs,
heart, kidneys, joints and nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   But prednisone, according to the Lupus Foundation of America, does
its own damage, eroding bone density so severely that young women
often need joint replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Keith B. Elkon, head of the rheumatology division at the
University of Washington, said Prestara, although not a breakthrough
drug in effectiveness, would be "important to the arsenal against
lupus" because it can help in counteracting prednisone's effects.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's favorable letter on Prestara figures to be good news for
lupus sufferers, because the agency's opposition has been
discouraging to pharmaceutical companies, which are leery of devoting
time and resources to drug development if they feel the bar for
approval is too high, said Duane Peters of the Lupus Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Genelabs has licensed the drug exclusively to Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Corona. But Wall Street analysts said
Genelabs figures to get about 15% of the drug's sales, if it is
approved, instead of the usual 7% in such agreements because it has
borne the brunt of development costs.</TE>

<HD>In S.F., Enron's 'E' Stands for Embarrassing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants asked a federal bankruptcy judge to force
Enron Corp. to remove a scoreboard sign featuring the fallen energy
company's tilted "E" logo from the baseball team's Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Baseball Associates and its affiliate China Basin
Ballpark Co., owners of the major league baseball team and its
stadium, said that "Enron's negative reputation alone" gave the
franchise the right to cancel the 1998 sponsorship deal.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants are "experiencing negative reaction from fans and the
media due to the continued presence" of the 17-foot-by-33-foot
centerfield scoreboard sign, the team said in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York. The team said it needed to start
looking for a new sponsor for the sign.</LD>
<TE>   A hearing has been set for Sept. 26 before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to get calls and comments from customers, sponsors
and the media asking why our Enron sign was still on the scoreboard
and were we supporting Enron in some way," said Elizabeth Murphy, a
vice president of the Giants, in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, was not
immediately available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Houston Astros baseball team paid $2.1 million to
buy back the naming rights for its home stadium, Enron Field, from
the energy company. Four months later, Coca-Cola Co. agreed to spend
more than $100 million over 28 years to rename the stadium Minute
Maid Park.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Enron rose 2.5 cents to 22.5 cents in over-the-counter
trading Friday. Enron filed what was then the largest Chapter 11
bankruptcy case in history on Dec. 2.</TE>

<HD>Chief Defends Fed Acts Amid Stock Bubble</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Alan Greenspan responds to critics, arguing
that the central bank could not have prevented the run-up of the late
1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday defended the
central bank's response to the late 1990s stock market bubble, saying
the Fed had no way to dampen investor euphoria without endangering
the entire economy.</LD>
<LD>   In an unusual public defense of his actions, Greenspan rejected
arguments that the Fed could have contained the bubble and the mess
it left behind by tightening the supply of money and nudging interest
rates higher before stock prices soared.</LD>
<LD>   "The notion that a well-timed, incremental tightening could have
been calibrated to prevent the late-1990s bubble is almost surely an
illusion," Greenspan said.</LD>
<TE>   Slowing the stock market would have required "nothing short of a
sharp increase in short-term rates" that would have risked a serious
economic downturn, he told participants at a Fed conference in
Jackson Hole, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan was responding to one of the more pointed criticisms of
his 15-year stewardship of the Fed. He is given generally high marks
for keeping inflation at historically low levels, but some Fed
watchers say the bank's actions contributed to the speculative
excesses of the late 1990s--and the pain inflicted on millions of
investors when stock prices collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   From March 2000, when the markets reached their high point,
through this July, more than $7 trillion in stock market value
evaporated. The 1990s bubble ultimately was deflated by a combination
of forces, including the recognition that many high-tech start-ups
had poor prospects of ever turning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed might have pricked the bubble at an earlier point with
more aggressive interest rate increases, Greenspan said, but doing so
might have triggered a severe recession--"the very outcome we would
be seeking to avoid." The U.S. economy entered a recession last year,
but economists said it was considerably milder than the downturn
Greenspan feared he would trigger with a big interest rate increase
during the late 1990s stock run-up.</TE>
<TE>   After expressing concern about "irrational exuberance" in 1996,
Greenspan became so enchanted with technology-driven productivity
growth, some critics say, that he was slow to recognize just how
exuberant investors had become.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an unusually defensive speech by the chairman," said Tom
Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a
watchdog group based in Philomont, Va. "This is not the kind of
speech that the chairman would have given when the economy and the
Fed were both riding so high two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Some economists interpreted Greenspan's remarks not only as an
attempt to justify the Fed's actions during the recent boom-and-bust
cycle but also as a preemptive move to deflect pressure to respond
more aggressively to future financial market fluctuations.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of commentary about the Fed targeting equity
markets," said John Sylvia, chief economist at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. "I think Greenspan clearly wanted to say, 'No, we
can't do that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan acknowledged that Fed officials found themselves in
unfamiliar territory in the late 1990s. The economy had been
expanding for the better part of a decade, and bullish investors had
bid up stock prices to unprecedented levels in relation to their
underlying earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were confronted with forces that none of us had personally
experienced," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Japan's continuing struggle with asset deflation,
Sylvia said, "only history books and musty archives gave us clues to
the appropriate stance for policy."</TE>
<TE>   He said Fed officials were concerned that stock prices appeared to
be rising to unsustainable levels. Even so, he said, "we recognized
that despite our suspicions, it was very difficult to definitively
identify a bubble until after the fact ... when its bursting
confirmed its existence."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan noted that the Fed raised short-term interest rates by 1
1/2 percentage points from mid-1999 through May 2000, but during
virtually all that period stock prices remained at record highs. It
was not the first time markets had failed to follow the Fed's lead:
Stock prices rose after even bigger rate hikes in 1989 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Greenspan also rejected suggestions that the Fed
could have reined in a runaway market by raising margin requirements,
which limit the ability of investors to buy stock with borrowed
funds. He said margin debt is mainly used by small investors who
account for a narrow slice of market activity.</TE>
<TE>   "The only effect of raised margin requirements is to price out the
very small investor without addressing the broader issue of stock
price bubble," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis, said it appeared in hindsight that the Fed stoked an
already overheated stock market by cutting interest rates in 1998 and
the first half of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But the central bank did so partly to keep the Asian financial
crisis and other economic shocks from triggering a broader
downturn--a sensible decision under the circumstances, Sohn said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, the risk of not cutting interest rates was a credit
freeze and a global recession," Sohn said. "The risk of easing too
much was probably a stock market bubble. I assume they made a
conscious decision based on risk and reward."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Moore, president of the Washington-based conservative Club
for Growth, said the debate over Greenspan's handling of the stock
bubble raises the bigger question of whether the central bank should
even consider intervening in financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be healthy if the Fed chairman didn't even talk
about the stock market, quite frankly," Moore said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall; Dow in Red for August</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Index has fifth-straight monthly loss. Gloomy
outlook by two tech firms and mixed economic news spur some profit
taking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed out the month on a sour note Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrials failing to hold a triple-digit gain as investors grappled
with conflicting economic reports and downbeat news from the
technology and telecom sectors.</LD>
<LD>   The day's loss left the Dow in the red for August--the widely
watched index's fifth-straight monthly loss and its longest such
losing streak since the summer of 1981.</LD>
<LD>   The market, particularly blue chips, got an early boost from data
showing expansion in manufacturing. But a report showing continued
weakness in consumer sentiment, a gloomy outlook from tech bellwether
Sun Microsystems--released after the market closed Thursday--and a
fresh profit warning from BellSouth gave investors reason to cash out
recent gains.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a growing sense that technology is going to take even
longer to turn on the earnings front, so investors are shipping money
out of that group," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the U.S. equity
group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average ended with a loss of
7.49 points, or 0.1%, at 8,663.50. Early on, the Dow was up more than
112 points, bolstered by industrials such as 3M, which closed up 30
cents at $124.95.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sagged 1.73 points, or 0.2%, to
916.07, while the tech-focused Nasdaq composite index fell 20.92
points, or 1.6%, to 1,314.85 to finish near its low of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The overall market was mixed. Winners led losers by about 9 to 7
on the New York Stock Exchange, while losers held a 9 to 8 edge on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow fell 2.4% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.6%, both
ending five straight weeks of gains. Nasdaq fell 4.8%. For August,
the Dow fell 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.5% and Nasdaq fell 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Volume on the last trading day of the month was among the lightest
of the year ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, with many investors
already on vacation and others heading out early. U.S. markets will
be closed Monday for the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Sun was down 14 cents at $3.69 and was the most actively traded
issue on Nasdaq. Late Thursday, the computer manufacturer lowered its
revenue outlook for the September quarter and said corporate spending
on technology may be weakening.</TE>
<TE>   Other computer-related tech shares felt a pinch from the Sun news.
Web gear maker Cisco Systems fell 38 cents to $13.82 and top chip
maker Intel fell 47 cents to $16.67. Among software companies,
Microsoft was off $1.50 at $49.08 and Oracle fell 37 cents to $9.59.</TE>
<TE>   "Tech's just not in good shape right now," said Mark Donahoe,
managing director of institutional sales trading at U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. "You still have somewhat of a slowdown."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, BellSouth, the No. 3 local telephone company, said 2002
earnings will fall below expectations due to a restructuring, weak
sales in its wireless business and the turbulent economy. BellSouth
lost 93 cents to $23.32. Dow member SBC Communications, BellSouth's
partner in the wireless joint venture Cingular Wireless, dropped
$1.06 to $24.74.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, bond yields were mixed, with the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped to 4.13% from 4.14% on
Thursday. Oil prices ticked up, while the dollar lost ground against
the Japanese yen and gained against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor equipment stocks were buffeted by a slew of
downgrades by Merrill Lynch, which cut its midterm ratings on

<LD>U.S. based Motorola Inc. said its partnership with two other
semiconductor makers probably will be the first to produce a new
generation of microchips, beating Intel Corp. by at least six months.</LD>
<LD>   Early this week, Motorola, STMicroelectronics and Philips jointly
unveiled a design platform to build chips based on 90-nanometer
circuitry, versus the current 130-nanometer standard. A nanometer is
one-billionth of a meter.</LD>
<LD>   Thinner circuitry makes each separate chip cheaper to produce,
faster and more energy-efficient.</LD>

<LD>   The average seven-day simple and compound yield on tax-free funds
held steady at a respective 0.83% and 0.84%, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Money fund yields are closely tied to the Federal Reserve's target
overnight lending rate, the federal funds rate, now at a 40-year low
of 1.75%.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dozen consumer advocacy and civil liberties groups urged a federal
judge Friday to reject the major record companies' attempt to force
Verizon Internet Services to identify a customer accused of extensive
music piracy.</LD>
<LD>   The groups--including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the
National Consumers League and Utility Consumers' Action
Network--argued that anonymous speech should receive strong
protection even in claims of copyright infringement.</LD>
<LD>   Cindy Cohn, legal director for Electronic Frontier Foundation,
said the record labels "asked the court to throw a long history of
protection of anonymous speech out the window as soon as someone
suspects copyright infringement on a peer-to-peer system."</LD>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America asked the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia last week to enforce a subpoena
the court issued to Verizon on July 24. The subpoena sought the name,
address and phone number of the customer whose account was being used
to offer hundreds of copyrighted songs for download.</TE>
<TE>   In its motion, the RIAA said a 1998 law compels Internet providers
to "expeditiously disclose to the copyright owner ... the information
required by the subpoena."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case, a federal judge in New York ruled Thursday
that MP3Board Inc. was not protected by the 1st Amendment when it
posted links to Web sites offering unauthorized downloads of
copyrighted songs. But U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein rejected
the record companies' request for a pretrial judgment against
MP3Board, as well as MP3Board's request for a pretrial judgment
against the record companies and the RIAA.</TE>

<LD>The exhumation of the body of Maria Felix concluded that the Mexican
film icon died of natural causes and was not given pills or poison
that hastened her death, local media reported.</LD>
<LD>   The beauty, who also gained fame as a staunch women's rights
advocate and a blunt commentator on Mexican politics, died in her
sleep at her Mexico City home April 8, her 88th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Her brother, Benjamin Felix, requested that her body be exhumed to
determine if she had been poisoned, though it was unclear why anyone
would do so. He had challenged her will, which did not include her
family.</LD>

<LD>A Chinese court sentenced two youths to life in prison for setting a
fire at an unlicensed Internet cafe that killed 25 people June 15 and
prompted a nationwide safety crackdown, the New China News Agency
said.</LD>
<LD>   The boys' ages were not given, and they were identified only by
their surnames, Liu and Song. But the report said they were spared
death because they were under 18 at the time of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   A girl convicted of helping the boys was sentenced to 12 years,
and a 13-year-old boy was sent to youth detention, the agency said.
It was the first time those two defendants were mentioned in the
case. The girl's age was not given.</LD>

<HD>Taiwanese Firm Plans a Foundry in China</HD>
<DH>Business: The deal, which is backed by Taipei, shows how
economics is trumping politics in island- mainland relations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>With the dust barely settling from the latest feud between Taiwan and
its archrival, China, yet another business from the island has
announced plans to set up shop on the mainland.</LD>
<LD>   This time, it's the world's largest maker of computer chips.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said this week that it had
signed an agreement to build a foundry in Shanghai.</LD>
<LD>   If the move is approved, the company will be the island's first
chip maker to open a plant in China's emerging high-tech heartland
with the Taiwanese government's blessing.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement follows renewed tension after Taiwanese President
Chen Shui-bian riled China this month by calling for a referendum on
independence and describing the island and the mainland as "two
countries." Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province.</TE>
<TE>   The business deal underscores the growing awareness in Taipei that
relations are increasingly defined by new economic opportunities
rather than old political rifts.</TE>
<TE>   "It means Taiwan will play the economic card and emphasize
economic interests," said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the
Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in Taipei. "Let's see if
Beijing will respond positively to this gesture."</TE>
<TE>   The Chen administration has come under greater pressure from
Taiwanese businesses in recent months to renew direct trade and
postal and transportation links with the mainland. Those ties have
been banned since the Chinese civil war more than five decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   With Taiwan struggling to recover from one of its worst recessions
in recent memory, island businesses are growing more impatient about
politics' standing in the way of better trade relations with their
giant neighbor across the Taiwan Strait.</TE>
<TE>   China is unlikely to negotiate on the issue of direct links unless
Taiwan accepts Beijing's "one-China" policy. But the mainland is
already getting many of the economic benefits from indirect ties.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwanese businesses have invested tens of billions of dollars in
the Chinese economy since Beijing swung its doors open to the world
two decades ago. Millions of Taiwanese live and work in China.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides are managing the relationship through business and
private channels," Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Taipei lifted a ban on Taiwanese semiconductor
companies' investing in China, though they are still restricted from
producing the most sophisticated chips on the mainland for fear that
the island's domestic industries will lose their competitive edge.</TE>
<TE>   But the rules on investment have long been easy to circumvent.
With the Shanghai area striving to become the semiconductor
manufacturing hub in the Asia-Pacific region, it has already
attracted other Taiwan-affiliated chip makers. Most of them bypassed
restrictions by channeling investments through a third country or
party.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a joint
venture between a Taiwanese entrepreneur and the son of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. Another is Taiwan's second-largest chip
manufacturer, United Microelectronics Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "If the No. 2 [chip maker] is here, of course the No. 1 is under
pressure to do the same," said Liu Yifei, a marketing executive at a
microelectronics firm in Shanghai. "Otherwise they will lose their
customers to their competitor."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Taiwan Semiconductor say they are interested in the
China market, but not at the expense of their home base.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not setting up there because of the cheap labor and
engineers," said J.H. Tseng, spokesman for the company. "Taiwan is
still our major investment place."</TE>
<TE>   Tseng said a memorandum of understanding between the firm and the
Shanghai city government is still subject to approval by Taiwan,
which most observers expect.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to hold it back," Yang said. "Economics will
be the only way to stabilize cross-strait relations."</TE>

<HD>Deaths of 200 Talibs Confirmed</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Captives being transported in containers were
injured and ailing, warlord says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A northern Afghan warlord admitted Friday that 200 Taliban prisoners
died last year while being transported in shipping containers, some
by suffocation, but he said the deaths were unintentional and mostly
caused by disease and injuries suffered in heavy fighting.</LD>
<LD>   Reports that as many as 960 captured Taliban fighters suffocated
after they were crammed into unventilated metal shipping containers
began emerging late last year. This week, the United Nations envoy to
Afghanistan said the current government did not have the resources to
investigate the claims.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, one of the country's most powerful
warlords, said the Taliban fighters died during a four-day operation
in November to transfer them from Kunduz, which had just been
captured by the Northern Alliance, to the northern city of
Sheberghan.</LD>
<TE>   "In no case were any prisoners killed. In no case was there any
intention that they should die in containers," Dostum said in a joint
statement with three other Northern Alliance commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said 200 of 400 people died.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essential to recognize that most of these died of wounds
from bombing and fighting in Kunduz ... but also due to disease,
suffocation, suicide and a general weakness after weeks of intense
fighting and bombardment," the statement added.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators for the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights said
hundreds ended up at a mass grave site in nearby Dasht-e-Leili.</TE>

<HD>Recent Arrests Bring a Sense of Betrayal in Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: News that Arab citizens and Palestinians in their
midst are among suspects has fueled unease among Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Two high-profile arrests involving groups of alleged extremists in as
many weeks have sparked a nationwide debate in Israel on "the enemy
within," how far democratic rights extend and whether Arabs living in
and on the periphery of the state can be trusted.</LD>
<LD>   What's hit the collective nerve and evoked feelings of betrayal
among many Israelis was the news that Palestinians holding Israeli
identity cards and Israeli Arabs were among the suspects in several
deadly attacks. The fact that the Palestinians have many of the same
benefits as Israelis and were relatively free to move around the
country has left people feeling abused and uneasy.</LD>
<LD>   "Israeli Arabs want all the rights but don't contribute to
society," said Moty Asor, a 43-year-old accountant living in
Jerusalem. "It's a big problem."</LD>
<TE>   Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security service, last week said
authorities had arrested five people alleged to be members of a Hamas
cell based in East Jerusalem that is accused of carrying out several
deadly attacks inside Israel's borders, including the Hebrew
University bombing in July that killed five Americans and four
Israelis, and a pool hall attack near Tel Aviv in May that killed 15
as well as the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   And this week, police announced the arrest of seven people accused
of helping a suicide bomber blow up a bus at Meron junction in
northern Israel on Aug. 4, killing nine people and wounding 48.</TE>
<TE>   The first case involved East Jerusalem Palestinians, part of a
community with permanent residency status giving them the right to
vote in local elections and, at least in theory, move freely
throughout Israel. The second group was made up of Israeli Arabs with
citizenship, allowing them to have Israeli passports, full voting
rights and many other benefits afforded Israeli Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a state of war," said Elie Rekhess, a senior research
fellow with Tel Aviv University. "Undoubtedly [these arrests] deepen
alienation, suspicion and rage."</TE>
<TE>   In a land where guilt by association often comes naturally and
trust was among the first victims of the 2-year-old Palestinian
uprising, the discovery of these two groups of suspects has increased
calls to suspend the rights of Israeli Arabs and even to usher all
Arabs out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "No Arabs, No Terror," reads one increasingly common bumper
sticker.</TE>
<TE>   Other events have fed the concern of Israelis. One news item
Wednesday was the arrest of two Israeli Arabs accused of knowingly
providing a ride for a suicide bomber. The other was the indictment
this month of an Israeli Arab who was riding the Meron junction bus
and failed to warn fellow passengers after the bomber told her to get
off.</TE>
<TE>   According to a poll released Friday by Maariv newspaper, 72% of
Israeli Jews believe that Israeli Arabs constitute a risk to state
security. Even among those who identified themselves as left-wing
voters, 58% feel threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate myself," said Tali Alon, a 35-year-old worker in the hotel
industry. "I have many Arab friends. They have the same rights we do.
And politically, both sides are to blame for this mess we're in. But
still I find myself getting suspicious when young Palestinians are
coming down the street."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the chorus calling for tougher measures, Lt. Gen. Moshe
Yaalon, the army's chief of staff, on Sunday warned of the "cancerous
threat" presented by Palestinians in the region. The daily Yediot
Aharonot raised similar concerns under the headline "Sleeping With
the Enemy." And residents of the Jewish settlement of Efrat called
for a ban on all Arab workers.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, some argue, are Israeli human rights groups that
defend Palestinians. "They work to enable greater activity and
greater freedom for the organized crime of Palestinian terror,"
columnist Amnon Lord wrote in Yediot Aharonot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Israeli Supreme Court is hearing a closely watched
case in which family members of alleged terrorists are facing
deportation as a deterrent, though the relatives are not accused of
doing anything.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the tension, however, alternative voices, including those of
Israeli President Moshe Katzav and Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, have countered that legitimate security concerns must be
kept in perspective. They argue that a handful of arrests--even of
people who might be backed, for argument's sake, by a few thousand
hard-core sympathizers--represent a minuscule portion of the 1.2
million Israeli Arabs living in the country and the 200,000
Palestinians with East Jerusalem ID privileges.</TE>
<TE>   "We must not generalize and besmirch a whole population where a
minority is concerned," Ben-Eliezer said. "Ganging up on the Arab
population is not justified."</TE>
<TE>   The increasingly tense atmosphere has heightened fears among many
Palestinians living legally in Israel and East Jerusalem of a
backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "Since they made the arrests last week, Israeli police have become
much more harsh with us; more checkpoints, more harassment, more use
of tax collectors, more suspicion," said Asharaf Salimah, a
25-year-old East Jerusalem resident working at a bus depot. "We have
an expression that every finger is different. But they catch one
Hamas group and treat us all like criminals."</TE>
<TE>   Mariam, a 57-year-old East Jerusalem homemaker who declined to
give her last name, said she fears Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon may try to exile all Arabs, even though many were born in
Jerusalem and have lived here all their lives. "Once the U.S. hits
Iraq, I'm just afraid he'll use that as an excuse to expel us all to
Jordan," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hillel Frisch, senior researcher with the Begin-Sadat Center
for Strategic Studies, a think tank, denies any punitive intent on
the part of Israel's military or police.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe there's anything vindictive or any element of
punishment in the security measures," he said. "I'm discomforted all
the time as well, even though I'm a Jew."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Israeli Arabs and Jerusalem Palestinians are caught
in the middle. Even as they come under suspicion from Israeli Jews,
they are not completely accepted by Palestinians living in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where the average income has dropped to about $2
a day in large part because of military restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a bit of a struggle-struggle situation in psychological
terms," said Mohammed abu Khalaif, 32-year-old manager of a dry-goods
store in East Jerusalem and holder of a Jerusalem ID card. "Sometimes
you don't know who you're with."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Arabs and Jerusalem Palestinians sometimes find themselves
the object of jealousy because their credentials give them better
access to social security and health insurance, along with more
mobility to pursue employment. They are accused of selling out,
lulled by Israel's better standard of living, and of not showing
enough commitment to the goal of Palestinian statehood.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Jirbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University
in the West Bank, argues that Israel has fanned these differences
under a divide-and-conquer strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "The differences come down to a question of how much control
people are allowed over their own destiny and how much they're able
to move around," Jirbawi said. "Israeli Arabs may have 70% control
over their lives these days, Jerusalem Palestinians maybe 40%, West
Bank and Gazaites almost nil."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Arabs and Jerusalem Palestinians, for their part, counter
that jealousy by West Bank and Gazan Palestinians fails to take into
account the higher taxes and insurance premiums they must pay for
social benefits. And they say they are working for change in their
own way.</TE>
<TE>   "The law will eventually provide a way to change Israel," said
Waseem Darwsheh, an Israeli Arab who says he exercises his right to
vote as a means of challenging injustice.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Jews and Arabs alike say they've seen similar periods of
deep distrust as extremists on both sides drown out moderate voices.
They express hope that eventually the parties will return to the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   "I work with Arabs, they're my neighbors at home," said Judith
Gait, a radio announcer from Jerusalem. "The vast majority denounce
terror. It's the politicians, the big people on both sides, who have
destroyed peace."</TE>
<TE>   "If they leave it to the people," she added, "people to people,
things will work out."</TE>

<HD>In Kenya, Angry Moi Fires Longtime Vice President</HD>
<DH>Africa: The aging leader can't seek reelection. But in
sacking his deputy, he hopes to remove a challenger to the man he
wants to succeed him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Moving to squelch an unprecedented revolt in his ruling party,
President Daniel Arap Moi on Friday fired his long-serving deputy,
who has been challenging Moi's efforts to install his own successor
when he retires in a few months.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the firing of George Saitoti, Kenya's vice president
for the last 13 years, was a warning to senior ministers and leaders
of the ruling Kenya African National Union, or KANU, who are defying
Moi's wishes by vying for the party's presidential nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Moi has been traversing this East African nation for the last
several weeks promoting Uhuru Kenyatta as his successor. Kenyatta is
the son of the country's first president and grew up in State House,
the presidential residence.</LD>
<TE>   Saitoti and three other KANU leaders have vigorously campaigned
against Moi's bid to "impose" a leader on the country. They say
Kenyatta, a 41-year-old businessman and political unknown, is too
inexperienced to lead the country. The four, who call themselves the
Rainbow Alliance after the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
say they want a fair chance to make their own runs for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Moi, who has ruled Kenya since the death of Jomo Kenyatta in 1978,
is barred from seeking reelection when his term expires in January.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential election, tentatively scheduled for December, is
being closely monitored by the United States and Britain--its former
colonial ruler. They see Kenya as a relatively stable country in a
bad neighborhood that includes war-ravaged Rwanda, Congo, Sudan and
Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Moi, who has previously jailed critics, including journalists and
opposition leaders, has been relatively restrained in dealing with
the recent persistent attacks on himself and his preferred candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, he fired two government ministers who
supported the Rainbow Alliance. This week, William Ruto, a government
minister close to Moi, called on the 58-year-old Saitoti to resign
for opposing Kenyatta, signaling that the president was becoming
increasingly unhappy with his appointed vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Moi's office issued a statement Friday declaring that Saitoti had
been sacked. No reason was given, and no replacement was named.
Saitoti's duties as home affairs minister were handed over to Ruto.</TE>
<TE>   Gichira Kibara, director of the Nairobi-based think tank the
Center for Governance and Development, said Saitoti's firing would
give Moi the opportunity to elevate Kenyatta to the post of his top
deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Kibara and other analysts say Moi is promoting Kenyatta because he
believes that the businessman would shield him from possible
prosecution for what many Kenyans believe is a legacy of high-level
corruption and poverty. The Berlin-based watchdog Transparency
International named Kenya this week as one of the six most corrupt
countries in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The analysts say Moi believes that Kenyatta would protect the vast
business empire he amassed during his presidency, just as Moi has
safeguarded the massive business interests accumulated by Kenyatta's
father.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts also say that Saitoti's firing could strengthen the
popularity of Moi's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, throngs of students from the nearby University of
Nairobi pushed past tourists dressed in safari suits at the famed
Norfolk Hotel to attend a news conference at which Saitoti, a former
mathematics professor, announced that he would continue campaigning
for president.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the hotel, students chanted "Moi must go!" and paraphrased
a Swahili hymn, singing: "Who created Moi? It is not you God, it is
Satan."</TE>
<TE>   "Our president is confused," said Jane Githui, a 23-year-old
student. "He is getting rid of the top guys who know his biggest
secrets.... He's only out to protect himself, not represent the
interests of the wananchi"--the common people.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Saitoti promised that if he won the presidency, he would
not seek revenge against Moi and his associates.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics of this country must be handled with maturity and
vision," Saitoti said. "I will not revisit the causative factors of
my humiliation."</TE>

<HD>Japan's Premier to Visit North Korea</HD>
<DH>Asia: Koizumi says he will seek 'breakthrough' in
relations. Planned trip is the latest sign that the Communist nation
is opening to others' views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced plans Friday to travel to
North Korea next month and meet with its leader, Kim Jong Il, in the
first visit by a Japanese head of state to the secretive,
authoritarian nation.</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi said that during a one-day summit on Sept. 17 he will
strive for a "breakthrough" in establishing formal diplomatic ties
between the nations.</LD>
<LD>   The visit is the latest sign that long-hermetic North Korea is
opening, if just a tad, to outside influence. With its economy in
tatters and many of its citizens ill-fed at best and starving at
worst, the nation has been more receptive to establishing relations
it long decried. Japan once ruled the Korean peninsula as a colony.</LD>
<TE>   Koizumi said he spoke by telephone with President Bush and South
Korean President Kim Dae Jung before committing to the visit, which
grew out of high-level talks between Japanese and North Korean
officials this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and South Korean presidents praised the initiative,
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. The
talks probably will be a topic of discussion when Koizumi visits Bush
in Washington just before his North Korea trip.</TE>
<TE>   Japan also informed the North's historical allies, China and
Russia, of the talks via diplomatic channels, Fukuda said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan is a key ally of the United States, with which Pyongyang has
long been at odds. The U.S. has been particularly concerned that
North Korea may be trying to develop nuclear arms, and Bush has
described the Communist regime as part of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, high-ranking delegates of several European
Union nations have visited Pyongyang. Some countries, including
Germany and Italy, have established embassies and trade ties there.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and former U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright both visited the nation in 2000. President
Clinton considered, but eventually rejected, making the controversial
journey.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the most significant such trip, President Kim of South
Korea visited two years ago. That summit turned into a seeming love
fest between the leaders of the two Koreas, which fought an armed
conflict from 1950 to 1953 and remain divided by one of the most
heavily fortified borders in the world. The countries technically are
still at war.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, world leaders and senior officials have come to
Kim Jong Il. He has yet to make good on a promise to visit the South,
although he has recently traveled by train to meet Putin and Chinese
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has had a volatile relationship with Japan since the
latter's brutal rule of the peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Pyongyang
wants an apology and compensation packages similar to ones Japan
recently gave to South Korea and China.</TE>
<TE>   One of the chief issues expected to be on the table when Koizumi
and Kim meet is North Korea's alleged kidnapping of Japanese
citizens, although it has never been clear why they would have been
abducted.</TE>
<TE>   By Tokyo's count, 11 people are being held, many of them
fishermen, although activist groups put the number as high as 70.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the animosity, Japan and North Korea do a sizable amount
of trade through third countries. Several senior Japanese political
leaders--including two who served as prime minister, although not at
the time of their visits--have traveled to Pyongyang in recent years.
Japan imports about $18 billion of North Korean fish, mushrooms, coal
products and clothing annually, while North Korea imports about $1
billion of Japanese rice, rubber, paper and aluminum, according to
Japan's Finance Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Akihiro Arimoto, 74, whose daughter Keiko allegedly was kidnapped
by North Koreans in 1983 at the age of 23, said in a telephone
interview that he hoped the talks would help him see her again. She
disappeared at an airport in Denmark, and her alleged kidnapper
confessed to taking her to North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a significant thing that the head of our country is
going to visit North Korea," Arimoto said. "I think that Koizumi is
going to apologize for colonizing North Korea, and I expect that Kim
Jong Il will accept the apology. And I want Kim Jong Il to apologize
for the abductions soon."</TE>
<TE>   So Chung On, spokesman for the group known as Chosensoren that is
the North's unofficial consulate in Tokyo, said Japan should
apologize and compensate Pyongyang for its past invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the solution of that, we hope to establish diplomatic
relations," he said. "We are very near geographically, and we are
very close historically, so we should be intimate with each other."</TE>
<TE>   The nations have been discussing the possibility of establishing
official relations for a decade.</TE>

<HD>Koreas Set a Date for Rail Project</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Work to reconnect lines on the divided
peninsula is to begin next month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>After years of delays, the two Koreas on Friday agreed to begin work
Sept. 18 to connect railroad lines across the mine-infested
demilitarized zone that has divided the peninsula for half a century.</LD>
<LD>   Economic officials meeting here also set an ambitious goal of
connecting the first of two lines by the end of this year. Roads
alongside the railway would also be repaired under the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea needs rail lines through the North to be connected to
China and Russia. That would transform what is, in effect, an island
to a part of the Asian continent.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea, meanwhile, desperately needs the fees it could earn
transporting cargo from South Korea to bootstrap its faltering
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a win-win proposition," said Cho Myong Chul, a North
Korean-born economist who defected to South Korea and now runs an
economic institute. "South Korea could save a huge amount of money in
its transportation costs, while the fees could really help the North
Korea economy."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement on the railroad deal is just one of several
indicators that the glacial pace of the reconciliation process
between North and South Korea is shifting to an express track.</TE>
<TE>   A South Korean newspaper, Munwha Ilbo, reported Friday that North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il might live up to his famously unfulfilled
promise to reciprocate South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's June
2000 visit to Pyongyang. The paper suggested that the visit could
take place during the Asian Games, which will be held in the South
Korean city of Pusan starting Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   In another surprise, the Japanese government announced that Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Sept. 17 will visit North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The reconnection of the North and South Korean railroads that were
destroyed during the 1950-53 Korean War is one of the most important
objectives of South Korean President Kim's "sunshine policy," for
which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000. But by the tally of one
South Korean newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, there have been eight
previously announced deals on the railroad, all of which have come to
naught.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials said Friday that they expected a better
prognosis for this agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until now, we haven't had a date. Now we do," said Kim Jung
Ro, a spokesman for the South Korean Unification Ministry. The work
on the first line could be finished within three months because there
is only an 11-mile stretch that is incomplete. Most of it extends
north from the demilitarized zone to the North Korean city of
Kaesong, where it would link up with existing lines.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to, the North Koreans can mobilize soldiers,
students and volunteers and get the work done very quickly," the
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea completed its part of the railroad this year,
investing an estimated $150 million for track improvements and new
stations--including the Dorasan facility, which President Bush
visited in February.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics say that the seeming flurry of activity has much to do with
South Korean political considerations. South Korea's President Kim is
anxious to see the railroad completed before his term expires in
February. The railroad would certainly help his favored successor,
Roh Mu Hyun, who faces a tight election Dec. 19 against conservative
Lee Hoi Chang. Lee advocates tougher measures toward North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Korean version of the October surprise," said North
Korea expert Lee Chung Min, referring to the habit of American
incumbents of pulling favorable news out of their hats just before
elections. He suggested that the North Koreans would be on their best
behavior for the next few months in an effort to swing the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I would imagine the groundbreaking will take place as scheduled,"
he said. "But they can pop all the champagne bottles they want; what
matters is when they complete construction and when this railroad is
up and running."</TE>
<TE>   Although the railroad was agreed upon earlier, the North Korean
military has been reluctant to commit itself to the degree of
cooperation with the South Korean military necessary to connect the
lines within the demilitarized zone.</TE>
<TE>   For Friday's deal, South Korea upped the amount of rice it is
donating this year to the North from 300,000 to 400,000 tons. It is
also donating 100,000 tons of fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   If the railroads are completed, one line would go from Seoul to
Shinuiju, a North Korean city near the Chinese border. The other
line, which under the agreement should be completed by spring, runs
along the east coast of the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's leader met last week with Russian President Vladimir
V. Putin in Vladivostok to discuss the railroad.</TE>

<HD>Arab Forum Assails Jews, 9/11 'Propaganda'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>A think tank affiliated with the Arab League, the 22-nation group
that seeks to forge a unified voice among its members, ended a
two-day conference on "Semitism" this week at which participants
labeled Jews "enemies of all nations," challenged the Jewish claim to
Israel and cast doubt on the U.S. account of who was responsible for
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Arab League, an important regional player that this year
promoted a pan-Arab initiative for peace that held out the promise of
normal relations with Israel, said it did not directly organize the
event. However, it participated with an official representative,
whose speech focused on the idea that Arabs cannot be anti-Semitic
because they are Semites.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish groups in the United States condemned the league's
participation, saying it amounted to "a stamp of approval."</LD>
<TE>   "Do such gatherings in any way further the cause of peace and
tolerance?" wrote Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles in a letter to league Secretary-General Amr Moussa.
"Or are they merely another ominous marker on the slippery slope of
hate, confrontation and war?"</TE>
<TE>   The Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up in Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates, said in a statement on its Web site that it
organized the conference "under the umbrella of the Arab League"
specifically to "expose the fallacious claims and concocted legends
of the Zionists and to counter their nefarious propaganda against
Arabs and Muslims after Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   In his opening remarks at the conference, the center's executive
director, Mohammed Khalifa Murar, said in part: "Jews claim to be
God's most preferred people, but the truth is they are the enemies of
all nations. Most philosophers ... consider Jews as cheaters whose
greed knows no bounds. Today, after having controlled the print and
electronic media, they distort facts to suit their objectives."</TE>
<TE>   He also said Jews "hide" elements of their history that prove they
are not Semites and therefore "have nothing to do with Semitism or
Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   His comments were reported on the group's Web site, www.
zccf.org.ae, and in two English-language newspapers in the Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Such harsh sentiments are certainly not new in a region where Jews
and Muslims have clashed since the earliest days of Islam about 1,400
years ago, when Jewish communities on the Arabian Peninsula rejected
the prophet Muhammad's message. But this week's meeting seems to
represent lost ground in Arab-Jewish relations. While such extreme
comments have been discouraged, at least officially, by moderate Arab
leaders, they have increasingly become part of acceptable everyday
discourse, a reality underscored by the Arab League's participation
in the conference this week.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Arab leaders had warned for months that the raging
conflict between Palestinians and Israelis threatened to undermine
whatever advances have been made since Israel was founded in 1948,
which for many meant a reluctant acceptance that the Jewish state is
here to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Zayed Center, a respected regional forum, is not only
promoting revisionist historical ideas aimed at redefining Jewish
identity but has dropped the distinction between Jews and Zionists.
That qualification had been relied on by many intellectuals and
leaders in the Arab world to distinguish between being anti-Semitic
and anti-Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is an unfortunate development," said Sharif Musa,
head of the Middle East studies department at American University in
Cairo, regarding the regional rise in anti-Jewish feelings. "But it
is just like in the U.S., where there are a few Muslim terrorists but
there is a campaign against Islam itself among Christian
fundamentalists who now think Islam is a religion of violence. It is
pretty bad everywhere. We live in a poisonous atmosphere, here and
there."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League declined several requests to comment. A spokesman
acknowledged that the Zayed Center is affiliated with the league but
said he could not comment until receiving a report on the event.</TE>
<TE>   The Zayed Center refused to comment on the telephone and did not
respond to a written request for comment sent via fax.</TE>
<TE>   The conference evoked a heated response from Jewish groups in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "What you are seeing and witnessing is the extension of the big
lie, denying Jewish history, denying the Holocaust," said Abraham
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, referring in
part to publications by the Zayed Center that dispute historical
accounts of Nazi atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   "It is part of a major effort to de-legitimize Israel and the
Jewish people," Foxman said. "If you undermine and remove the Jewish
history, then this is all a myth and the poor Arabs are victimized by
a fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League's participation added "a level of legitimacy to
this garbage that wasn't there before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The deep hostility and anger at Israel and Jews springs from an
environment roiled by two years of bloodletting between Israelis and
Palestinians, by talk of a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and by regional
domestic concerns such as high unemployment. It grows also from
frustration at the perceived impotence of Arab leaders to deal with
the regional concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional dynamic was further complicated by the events of
Sept. 11, which left many Arabs feeling victimized and under siege.
Many people on the street in the Arab world have clung to the idea
that the U.S. government fabricated the case against Osama bin Laden,
the alleged mastermind behind last year's attacks on New York and the
Pentagon, and similar thoughts were expressed by a leading Egyptian
academic at the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 were "concocted, because we still do not
possess concrete evidence of the real perpetrators and their
objectives," Mohammed Khalifa Hassan, director of the Center of
Oriental Studies at Cairo University, said in response to a question
at the seminar. "Those explosions have complicated the Arab-Israeli
conflict and labeled Arabs and Muslims as terrorists, and instead of
treating the Palestinian problem as a political issue, it reduced it
to an issue of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Hassan did not respond to two calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the feelings of victimization are now so woven into the
fabric of everyday thought that the in-flight magazine of Egypt's
state-owned airline picked up the thread.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obvious that Jewish rule in Jerusalem was an ancient and
transient episode in the history of the city which cannot justify its
seizure and annexation 30 centuries later," concludes one article in
a magazine distributed to all passengers of Egypt Air. The article
says Israel's claim to Jerusalem is "spurious in fact and in law."</TE>
<TE>   The arguments are not new. But their presence in this type of
magazine is, and that is a sign of the change in the public psyche,
according to political observers such as Taher Masri, a former
Jordanian representative to the Arab League.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of anger with what's going on in Palestine, and
many people--not all of them, but the majority--feel that the effort
that has been made by many Arabs, including the Palestinians, to
build an acceptable peace with Israel, including real recognition,
has been aborted by Israel itself through what it is doing to the
Palestinians for more than two years," Masri said.</TE>
<TE>   When the conference opened Wednesday, Murar, the Zayed Center's
executive director, said that "any discourse about Jews' history will
remain incomplete if it doesn't shed light on that aspect of Jews
that they always try to hide, i.e., their non-Semite origin." He then
offered an account that strips most Jews of their Semitic roots.</TE>
<TE>   It was an account that Cooper of the Wiesenthal Center called
"hogwash" in his letter to Moussa, adding it is "at the cornerstone
of [Palestinian Authority President] Yasser Arafat's big-lie tactics
designed to teach generations of Palestinian children that their
Israeli neighbors are no more than lying usurpers of the Holy Land."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League's representative at the meeting, Ahmad Saleem
Jarad, head of Israeli affairs for the group, made comments that
seemed to endorse Murar's view.</TE>
<TE>   "If the phrase 'anti-Semitism' is taken literally, it means
hostility toward Semites or members of the Semitic race whose
majority is comprised of Arabs," he was quoted as saying in the
English-language Gulf News. "Only a few Jews can genuinely claim to
be Semites."</TE>
<TE>   According to its Web site, the Zayed Center was created "in
cognizance of the principles and objectives of the League of Arab
States ... which would endeavor to highlight the concept of Arab
solidarity in the political, economic, cultural, social and
inter-Arab relations," among other goals.</TE>
<TE>   One of the center's most recent studies, published last month, is
titled "Role of the Jews in Distorting the Arab Image in Western
Culture."</TE>

<HD>A Palestinian Cabinet Minister Urges End to Suicide
Bombings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Palestinian interior minister said in an interview published
Friday that militants must halt suicide bombings against Israelis or
face "isolation" by Palestinian society.</LD>
<LD>   But the Hamas group rejected his appeal, and violence continued,
with Palestinians killing a second woman accused of collaborating
with Israel, this one the 18-year-old niece of a woman slain last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian Interior Minister Abdel Razak Yehiyeh said in the
interview that he has asked Palestinian militant groups, including
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to "stop the suicide bombings, stop the
murders for no reason."</LD>
<TE>   Yehiyeh told the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot that "suicide
attacks are contrary to the Palestinian tradition, against
international law and harm the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh acknowledged his failure to secure agreement for an end to
attacks in meetings this month in the Gaza Strip but added, "If the
suicide attacks continue, these factions will find themselves
isolated in Palestinian society."</TE>
<TE>   Hamas official Abdulaziz Rantisi dismissed Yehiyeh's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "He should have called on the Zionists to end their occupation and
massacres. That is enough reason for pursuing the resistance and the
martyrdom operations," Rantisi said.</TE>
<TE>   During the nearly two years of current Israeli-Palestinian
fighting, more than 250 Israelis have been killed in about 70 suicide
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Tulkarm, an 18-year-old Palestinian woman
was shot dead Friday by militants from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
affiliated with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Some sources said the militants accused Rajaa Ibrahim of planting
the bomb that killed a local militant leader, Raed Karni, on Jan. 13.
Others said she had provided information to Israel that allowed
troops to track down Karni.</TE>
<TE>   Brigade members said they killed her in a deserted house and
dumped her body outside the Tulkarm hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim's aunt, Ikhlas Khouli, was killed by Al Aqsa militants a
week ago for alleged collaboration, in the first such case involving
a woman after dozens of killings of men accused of collaborating.</TE>

<HD>Is National Pastime Past Its Prime?</HD>
<DH>Marketing: It's a whole new ballgame trying to regain glory
in a crowded field.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last-minute accord between major league baseball's owners and
players may have saved the season, but can it save the sport?</LD>
<LD>   By many indications, big-league baseball is in decline. Attendance
at ballparks is down. Television viewership of the World Series has
plummeted. The fan base is aging. Fewer kids play it. Once America's
undisputed summer king, baseball now competes against football,
basketball, Game Boys, extreme sports, the Internet and satellite TV
services with hundreds of channels.</LD>
<LD>   The sport's checkered labor history, not its only woe, has served
to further alienate fans, evidenced by those in Anaheim on Thursday
who pelted players with trash and shouted, "No strike!"</LD>
<TE>   "The fact is that by devoting so much energy to war with the union
over the years ... baseball doesn't do all the things it has to do to
develop the game," said Fay T. Vincent, baseball commissioner from
1989 to 1992. "It can't spend time and money on youth baseball. It
can't spend on marketing.... I think the cost of bad labor relations
in baseball has been monumental."</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety about the future of the sport all but hovered over the
negotiating table and may have motivated both sides to avert a
strike, said William B. Gould, a Stanford University professor who is
working on a book about how baseball has changed.</TE>
<TE>   The fear was that a strike would have led "to a smaller number of
kids actually participating in the game," said Gould, who as former
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board was involved in the
1994-1995 strike and sided with the players. "There are other sports
and forms of entertainment occupying people's attention."</TE>
<TE>   League officials said Friday that the labor agreement would help
attract more fans. Bringing competitive parity to the game, they
said, ultimately would give more franchises a shot at the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "The greater anticipation in the stands and at home is one of your
best marketing tools," said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for major
league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   To gain more exposure, the league has more than doubled its
sponsorships to $170 million in recent years and launched its own Web
site in 2001. Wladika and others say the sport's ratings are no cause
for alarm, since there has been a similar slide in numbers for all
network programming because of the proliferation of cable and
satellite channels.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the sport on the decline? No," said Douglas Noverr, chairman
of the American thought and language department at Michigan State
University, who has researched and written about the game. "I think
baseball has an underlying cultural mythology that is very
resilient.... No sport generates a fascination with numbers the way
baseball does."</TE>
<TE>   But others say the falling interest in the game is far more
serious. The sport must find a way to do what the National Basketball
Assn. and National Football League do so well: remain relevant to a
fickle audience with plenty of choices.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA has aggressively courted young fans and a hip image. The
NFL, also aware of an aging fan base, is tackling the problem
head-on: On Thursday, the league will kick off its 2002 season with a
free street party for 100,000 people in Times Square in New York
featuring Bon Jovi, Enrique Iglesias, Eve and Alicia Keyes.</TE>
<TE>   By some accounts, baseball is still paying for its last player
strike, a marathon affair that canceled the 1994 World Series.
Attendance dropped from a game average of 31,256 in 1994 and has yet
to rebound fully; it is now 29,813, league figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Television viewership of the World Series and the All-Star game,
baseball's signature events, has dropped dramatically. An average 44
million people tuned in to see the Philadelphia Phillies beat the
Kansas City Royals in 1980, compared with 29.6 million viewers who
watched the Arizona Diamondbacks upset the New York Yankees last year
in one of the most exciting championships ever.</TE>
<TE>   This year's All-Star game pulled in 14.7 million viewers, the
fewest ever, Nielsen Media Research reported.</TE>
<TE>   More ominous are figures for youth participation. There was a 10%
decrease in the number of children ages 7 to 17 who played baseball
between 1991 and 2001, a survey by the National Sporting Goods Assn.
found. That compares with a 238% increase for those who go
snowboarding and 163% increase for children who in-line
skate--numbers that underscore the growing competition baseball faces
for replacement fans.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sport struggles with demographics. The average
television viewer is 51 years old, compared with 45 for football and
40 for basketball, say executives at the Fox network, which carries
national baseball broadcasts. Advertisers and sponsors generally
spend more money on programming that reaches a younger audience.</TE>
<TE>   The game's drooping fortunes have even dragged down the
multimillion-dollar trading card market. Baseball accounts for 60% of
all sports and entertainment trading cards sales--and those tumbled
from $800 million before the 1994 strike to $350 million this year,
said Scott Kelnhofer, editor of Card Trade, the journal of the sports
collectible industry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old saying: 'As baseball goes, so does our industry,'
" Kelnhofer said.</TE>
<TE>   Others say there's no need to panic and call some of those figures
deceiving.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Bakersfield economics professor David Berri says
baseball attendance has more than rebounded after the bitter 1994
strike.</TE>
<TE>   He says his research shows that the figures haven't reached
pre-strike levels because the players walked out during a time of
artificially high head counts caused by two teams playing in large
football stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   "To the average person going to the game, this is simply
entertainment," Berri said. "And when the game is taken away, they'll
find other ways to entertain themselves until the game comes back."</TE>
<TE>   His observation was echoed by Jeffrey S. Brand, dean of the
University of San Francisco law school and a confirmed baseball nut.</TE>
<TE>   Brand said he felt "disgusted" with both sides in the labor talks,
especially after realizing that the salary of Texas Rangers shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, the sport's highest-paid player, is about 80% of the
annual gross national product of Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   But even his moral outrage won't keep him from the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it hearkens back to what people want, whether it's
nostalgia or a slower pace or just the skill of hitting a ball that
has 105 red stitches and is traveling at 95 miles an hour.... That
appeal, thank God, can't be killed by fights over luxury taxes and
revenue sharing."</TE>
<TE>   It can, however, be dimmed by time and the sport's apparent
inability to react quickly enough to social circumstances, others
say.</TE>
<TE>   The signs already are appearing. Empty ball fields dot the
landscape of a nation that has cocooned with its computers, moved on
to the skateboard parks and gravitated to athletic pursuits other
than a game grounded in the agrarian past, said Robert Thompson,
professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University.</TE>
<TE>   "You can really begin to see the change in the relationship
between baseball and the American heart by driving around in America,
by seeing baseball diamonds without kids playing baseball on them,"
Thompson said. "Soccer balls, yes. Basketballs, absolutely.
Footballs, yes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think averting the strike is going to put 12-year-olds on
the vacant lots and baseball fields like they were 40 years ago," he
said. "We're going to have to see if baseball can survive....
Shot-putting was really big in ancient Greece. It's not so big
anymore."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Exports Face Record Penalties</HD>
<DH>Trade: European Union says it will hold off on $4 billion
in duties OKd by WTO in tax dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Trade Organization on Friday authorized the European Union
to impose a record $4 billion in penalties on American goods unless
the United States eliminates a controversial tax break for U.S.
exporters deemed illegal under global trade rules.</LD>
<LD>   The long-anticipated decision raises the pressure on Congress to
push forward on tax reform or risk a trade war that would jeopardize
$1 billion a day in transatlantic trade and further depress the
fragile global economy.</LD>
<LD>   Under WTO rules, the European Union could impose as much as $4
billion in duties on food products, airplane parts, aluminum and
other imports from the U.S. The exact items have yet to be
determined. The $4 billion in duties is believed to be 20 times
greater than the previous record for WTO-approved sanctions.</LD>
<TE>   With so much at stake for Brussels and Washington, the EU
immediately declared its intention to hold off on any penalty as long
as the U.S. makes progress toward resolving this long-running dispute
over conflicting tax policies.</TE>
<TE>   EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said Friday's decision provided
"major incentive for the U.S. to eliminate this huge illegal export
subsidy" within a "short period of time."</TE>
<TE>   "Before any countermeasures are taken, we will carefully evaluate
progress made on U.S. implementation," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether the U.S. can move fast enough on such a
complex issue to hold off frustrated EU bureaucrats who are unhappy
about other recent American trade actions, including steel tariffs
and farm subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick voiced unhappiness
about the size of the penalty, because the U.S. had argued that the
fine should be no more than $1 billion. But he and other U.S.
officials, including congressional leaders from both parties,
insisted they were working on legislation to comply with the WTO
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who chairs the House Ways
and Means Committee, has submitted a bill that would do away with the
offending tax break while providing other types of tax relief for
U.S. multinationals. Companies such as Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc.
and Microsoft Corp. were among those that benefited from the disputed
law.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Senate
Finance Committee, said he was disappointed by the WTO's decision and
was particularly concerned that farmers would bear the brunt of
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "That said, I believe it's critically important the United States
comply fully with the rule of law," he said in a statement Friday,
adding that "the ball is in our court."</TE>
<TE>   A ballooning budget deficit and weak economy will make it tough
for Congress to push forward on tax reform in the coming months,
particularly with fall elections fast approaching.</TE>
<TE>   That means it won't be until next year before politicians get
serious about fixing this problem, according to U.S. tax and trade
experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The weak investment picture is leading a lot of people to talk
about savings and investment incentives, which might take up a lot of
available money for tax changes," said Stephen Entin, president of
the Washington-based Institute for Research on the Economics of
Taxation.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the dispute involves the Foreign Sales Corporation
tax law passed by Congress in 1971, which allowed firms to exempt a
portion of their income obtained from overseas sales. But the EU
complained that the U.S. was, in effect, creating an export subsidy
through its tax law and filed a complaint that was upheld by the WTO
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. later amended the law, but in January the WTO ruled that
the revised law still violated trade rules. Friday's decision simply
set the size of the penalties that the EU could impose.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of U.S. tax law, including Rep. Thomas, say the U.S.
should move to a territorial system in which the government taxes
only income earned within its borders--a system similar to what is
used in Europe and most of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. currently uses a global system in which it taxes income
earned abroad as well as in the U.S., although it does provide a
break to companies that have paid taxes to another government.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, his proposed legislation would simplify the tax
requirements for international traders, lessen the likelihood firms
would face double taxation on income earned abroad and increase the
incentives for U.S. firms to stay at home rather than seek tax havens
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer we wait to reform our uncompetitive tax code, the more
jobs we lose to foreign competitors," Thomas said in a statement
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute
for International Economics, believes that the immediate problem is
with the WTO.</TE>
<TE>   He says the Geneva-based trade group should revise its rules to
recognize key differences in tax policies and allow governments to
take measures to level the playing field.</TE>
<TE>   "The international rules now are truly lopsided," he said.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom's Former CEO Got $11 Million in IPO Deals</HD>
<DH>Securities: WorldCom's ex-CEO netted $11million in deals
with Salomon Smith Barney for shares of new publicly traded firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers got in on the
initial stock offerings of hot technology companies during the late
1990s market bubble and earned $11 million in trading profits, thanks
to his relationship with Wall Street brokerage Salomon Smith Barney.</LD>
<LD>   Documents released Friday by the House Financial Services
Committee showed that Ebbers turned a profit on 17 of 21 initial
public stock offerings, with his largest gain topping $4.5 million on
100,000 shares of Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. Ebbers was one of
several WorldCom executives who was allocated large blocks of shares
in new public companies by Salomon.</LD>
<LD>   "He made a lot of money and I'd like to know how many other people
were as favored as he [was]," said Jim Cox, a professor of securities
law at Duke University. "Why did he get the allocations?"</LD>
<TE>   The documents were obtained by subpoenaing records from Salomon.
The House committee is investigating whether the New York brokerage,
which earned millions of dollars in investment-banking fees from
WorldCom, tried to win business by parceling out coveted IPO shares
to executives. Such spinning, as it's known on Wall Street, may be in
violation of securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also is examining whether individual investors
suffered as a result of preferential treatment for executives at
WorldCom and other companies. Individuals who were denied shares in
new public companies would have had to pay far higher prices for the
stock once trading began. Buying at such inflated levels could have
exacerbated losses for investors who held on to the stocks, many of
which later plunged in value in the bear market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard evidence of the advantage that corporate insiders had
over individual investors," said Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for
the committee's chairman, Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, a unit of financial services giant Citigroup Inc., has
denied any wrongdoing. In a letter accompanying the documents, Jane
Sherburne, Citigroup's deputy general counsel, said the executives
received allocations of shares because they were among the firm's
best individual clients.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found no evidence that shares in IPOs were allocated as a
quid pro quo for investment-banking business," Sherburne wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A Salomon spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The committee probe is part of a broad inquiry by congressional
investigators and government regulators into Wall Street's conduct
during the late-1990s bull market. The investigations center on
whether the firms committed abuses that hurt investors and helped to
fuel the spate of corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   In an IPO, a company sells shares to the public for the first
time. Salomon allocated IPO shares to Ebbers, allowing him to
purchase stock at the initial offering price, the documents show.</TE>
<TE>   In the frenzied market of the late 1990s, stock offerings,
especially for technology-related companies, routinely surged in
value on their first trading day as investors clamored for hot IPOs.
Thus, investors who were able to acquire shares at the initial price
usually made large and immediate profits.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released earlier this week showed that Ebbers was
allocated 869,000 shares in 21 companies from 1996 through 2000. But
the data, which had been gathered in an initial subpoena, fail to
indicate when Ebbers and other executives bought and sold the shares,
or how much they earned. At least seven of the companies in which
Ebbers bought shares ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection, but
Ebbers profited from his investment in six of those companies.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' biggest loss came on 35,000 shares of Williams
Communications Group, a fiber-optic network operator that went public
in September 1999 at $23 a share. Ebbers still holds the shares,
giving him a paper loss of $804,405.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon said the shares Ebbers bought in one of the companies, a
$440,125 gain in Juniper Networks Inc., were distributed to him by
Juniper rather than by Salomon, thus making his gain on Salomon
allocations about $10.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The data made public Friday also show that Stiles Kellett, a
WorldCom board member, earned a profit of $202,047 on 29 IPO issues
he received.</TE>
<TE>   However, Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial
officer who this week was indicted on criminal charges for allegedly
inflating the company's earnings, lost a total of $13,059, the
records show. Sullivan booked gains on seven of nine new offerings,
but incurred a $144,450 loss on Internet company Rhythms
NetConnections Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers continued to receive allocations of shares in new public
companies despite selling several IPOs shortly after buying them. In
12 offerings, he sold all or part of his holdings within a month,
including stocks in three companies that he unloaded the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Small investors who engage in such "flipping" often are denied
subsequent allocations. Brokerages have said they want investors who
will hold the stocks for the long term, providing a company with a
stable shareholder base.</TE>
<TE>   As they study the documents, investigators are expected to look
closely at the specific dates on which shares in new public companies
were placed in Ebbers' Salomon brokerage account.</TE>
<TE>   The timing is key because investigators are trying to determine
whether Ebbers received shares after trading had begun and the shares
already had risen in value. Awarding shares after the price had gone
up would have given him a risk-free profit.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 instances, the date on which shares were credited to Ebbers'
account was a day after the trade date, when the shares were priced,
the records show. The gap is two days on two occasions, and three
days on one occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon said in its letter that booking shares in new public
companies a day or two after the trade date is "appropriate and
common" and can occur for a "host of benign reasons."</TE>
<TE>   That can happen when allocations are confirmed after the stock
market has closed for the day or when final allocation data is not
available immediately, Sherburne wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Sherburne also addressed an issue that arose in documents supplied
for the first subpoena. Salomon revealed that its brokers sought tens
of thousands of shares in two hot new public companies for about two
dozen other telecom executives in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Sherburne said in Friday's letter that the brokers received only
about 2% of the requested shares.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom paid Ebbers $1 million in salary in 2001, but he was not
awarded a bonus for the year. He was granted options to buy 1.2
million WorldCom shares, and received nearly $48,000 in 401(k)
contributions and personal use of the corporate jet.</TE>
<TE>   His most controversial compensation came in the form of company
loans totaling more than $400 million, which will be repaid over five
years under an amended agreement reached after Ebbers' resignation in
April.</TE>
<TE>   As part of Ebbers' severance agreement, WorldCom agreed to pay him
an annual pension of $1.5 million for life, and $750,000 per year to
his wife for life, plus medical and life insurance benefits, use of
corporate aircraft and office space.</TE>

<HD>Town's 'Savior' Came Up Short</HD>
<DH>Wealthy Vons grocery heir gave Mariposa residents visions
of wealth and civic revival. But it didn't pan out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MARIPOSA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When Wilfred L. Von der Ahe Jr. arrived in this struggling Sierra
town 16 years ago, just about everybody saw gold. After all, he was
the wealthy scion of a storied Los Angeles family: founders of the
Vons Grocery Co., devout Catholics lauded by the Vatican for their
charitable giving, and power brokers who presided over the finest
country clubs.</LD>
<LD>   He seemed to be just what Mariposa needed: a deep-pockets savior.</LD>
<LD>   Perched at the intersection of California 140 and 49, Mariposa
lives and dies by tourism. It boasts the oldest continuously
operating county courthouse west of the Mississippi River, the
esteemed Mariposa Museum and History Center, and the California State
Mining and Mineral Museum.</LD>
<TE>   But Mariposa relies almost exclusively on Yosemite traffic, and as
the national park suffered in the 1990s--from recession, a federal
government shutdown, rock slides and floods--the town did too.
Already low property values were depressed still further.
Unemployment soared into the mid-teens and stayed there. Businesses
struggled and failed.</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe, then 51, didn't waste much time.</TE>
<TE>   He bought thousands of acres around these forested hills. He
purchased half the tiny historic downtown. He took over the Mariposa
Mine, once owned by Civil War general and explorer John C. Fremont,
and snapped up the town's rattiest motel. Von der Ahe planned to
bring it all to life, and everyone here wanted in on the action.</TE>
<TE>   Realtors sidled up to him. Every club and cause competed for a
handout. Strangers smiled at him with nervous yearning. Even the
ambitious county assessor stepped in, advising Von der Ahe on his
growing portfolio. Suddenly, one man seemed to promise a renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the money he had, everyone was thinking, 'Oh boy, this
is going to be nice,' " said Mike Wright, the county's former chief
appraiser.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many in Mariposa think, be careful what you wish for.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of people come to these pine-studded hills to start over.
Some run from the law. Others simply crave the peace and quiet of the
rolling ranchland, just an hour's drive from Yosemite Valley's
humbling power.</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe was seeking refuge too, from his family's outsized
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Charles T. Von der Ahe immigrated from Copenhagen to Los Angeles,
and opened his first Vons Groceteria at 7th and Figueroa streets in
1906. He built a chain of 87 stores, then sold in 1929 in time to
avoid the stock market's collapse. In 1932, he gave sons Wilfred and
Theodore the financial backing to relaunch Vons Grocery Co. Their
flagship store offered a bakery, deli, meat, grocery and produce
departments under the same roof and was dubbed a "supermarket"--a
term that caught on nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   From the Jonathan Club to the Wilshire Country Club and beyond,
the Von der Ahes were civic powerhouses and prolific donors. Among
the many buildings that bear the family name are several at Loyola
University in Westchester. The family sold the Vons chain in 1969 in
a deal valued at $120 million, but remained involved until Wilfred's
retirement in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Wilfred Jr. was drawn to a different path. The
eldest child in a staunchly Catholic family, he graduated from St.
John's Seminary College in Camarillo in 1964 and, following in an
uncle's footsteps, became a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Then he and the conservative Von der Ahe clan parted ways. He
marched with Cesar Chavez and his United Farm Workers, backing the
historic grape boycott even though that stance hurt supermarket
owners such as his father.</TE>
<TE>   He gave impassioned homilies. He backed the Catholic Worker peace
and justice movement and attended group therapy sessions with other
hippie priests. But his sermons deviated from church dogma. He
offended congregants in Long Beach by using profanity, and he
socialized liberally with nuns.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he was called in by conservative then-Cardinal Francis
McIntyre for a reprimand. His father accompanied him. But after the
second scolding, Von der Ahe Jr. was suspended. When he was ordered
to move out of his parish rectory, he was so mortified that he holed
up in a motel rather than knock on his parents' door.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it crushed him," said Dan Delany, a former classmate who
left the priesthood in 1967 just before Von der Ahe did. "He never
associated with the Catholic Church after that, never had his kids
baptized.... His response was to abandon the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   His brothers had followed their father's entrepreneurial example,
launching a successful real estate development company in 1970.
Wilfred Jr. dabbled in that family business, but "he didn't trust the
other Von der Ahes," said Maureen Murphy, a former nun who later
became Von der Ahe's longtime girlfriend. "If you peeled away the
layers, it was, 'I want to be like my dad, but I want to be making it
on my own.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lean and ruggedly handsome with laughing blue eyes, Von der Ahe
retreated to a rambling home on Bass Lake, not far from Mariposa. He
married there, had a child and adopted three more. But it was only in
1986, a few years after his wife died of cancer, that Von der Ahe
made this town his permanent home.</TE>
<TE>   Then the buying spree began.</TE>
<TE>   First, there was land. On one 1,600-acre holding here, he launched
an ambitious reforestation project, planting more than 1.2 million
redwood, cedar and noble pine seedlings. There were grazing tracts,
office buildings and a planned subdivision spanning three counties.
But it was when he gobbled up the estate of Italian grocer Emile
Trabucco in 1989 that the town really took notice.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase included 2,300 acres of ranchland outside town and
four historic buildings that dominate one side of Mariposa's
downtown. They include the Gold Coin Club, an 1850 adobe used as an
office by Fremont and later operated as a bar, and the brick and
metal Trabucco warehouse, built in 1858 as the MacDermott and Co.
general store.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the purchase of the rundown Mariposa Mine, an ugly
commercial building on the north end of town, and the dilapidated
Mel-O-Dee motel.</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe's father had impressed on him that wealth should grow
steadily, said former Mariposa County Assessor Steve Dunbar, a friend
who advised on many of the purchases. For each property, there was a
plan for improvements to make the investment worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations in town ran high. Bud Graham, a former Mariposa
Realtor, acknowledges that he was among an army of hungry
businesspeople who "tried to suck up to him to curry favor." The
Friends of the Library scored the use of a building. The county
leased Von der Ahe's downtown parking lot for $1. The hospital got a
series of anonymous donations. But the list of requests was long.</TE>
<TE>   "He could be selfless," said Graham, who became friends with Von
der Ahe when he stopped expecting business from him. "But it's hard
to be selfless when you've got the whole world asking you for money,
the whole world thinking you're going to bring downtown Mariposa up
to snuff."</TE>
<TE>   At first, it seemed that he would. In 1991, Von der Ahe helped get
the downtown buildings listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. He envisioned the Trabucco Warehouse as a family restaurant.
He visited Old Sacramento, using it as a model for what he hoped
Mariposa could become, and drafted blueprints.</TE>
<TE>   But as the years wore on, Mariposa got to know Von der Ahe a
little better.</TE>
<TE>   When he tried to launch his own cafe, he meddled so much that his
chef quit before it opened. When he rented out the restaurant, that
backfired too.</TE>
<TE>   "He had strange things that tripped him off," said Shirley Felix,
who spent five hours negotiating a simple lease, only to have Von der
Ahe refuse to renew after Felix poured $30,000 in improvements into
the property. "He put me through hell."</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe was generous with the few he trusted. He gave Delany
down payments to buy halfway houses in Los Angeles and Sacramento for
the poor and infirm, offered a veritable stranger and his family a
stay at his palatial Bass Lake home, and reached out to help
recovering alcoholics in Mariposa. But he was guarded and suspicious
with most, and frugal to extremes, buying old vegetables and taking
cold showers.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he emerged with a bag from the Friends of the Library
bookstore. "He was so proud," said Tom Ohmer, a friend and classmate
from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks who also ended up in
Mariposa. "He said, 'I've done all my Christmas shopping and I only
spent $2.' "</TE>
<TE>   When he found pleasure, it was outside the realm of material
wealth. Once, he invited David Marks--a local herb farmer and
intimate friend--to lunch after an agricultural fair in Fresno. But
at the car, "he goes to the trunk and pulls out two foot-long
carrots," Marks said. "He's standing there soaking wet, happiness all
over his countenance, chewing on a damned carrot. I said, 'Wilfred,
you look like a man who has everything.' And at that moment, he did."</TE>
<TE>   To rare friends such as Marks, Von der Ahe was neither the town's
savior nor its betrayer. He was just a man who mostly wanted to be
left alone to collect antiques, dabble in history and geology, and
ride his mountain bike across his vast forest lands. But for most
around town, disappointment and bitterness set in like a cold fog.</TE>
<TE>   Controlling and secretive in his business dealings, Von der Ahe
refused to hire help, holing up alone in an office overrun by paper.
He was in over his head.</TE>
<TE>   Rehabbing the buildings was a daunting task. They sat for years,
filling up with bats. A government grant for restoration work was
sent back when Von der Ahe failed to step up with required matching
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Today, most of his properties remain shuttered. The Mel-O-Dee is a
picture of decay, its porch railings pried away by vandals for
firewood and its windows punched out. The mine sat flooded, its
outbuildings recently set afire by teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in his heart he wanted to preserve history, but he really
didn't know what to do next," said Kerry Lee, curator of the Mariposa
Museum and History Center. "He got overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Others are less forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "He hurt the town," said Pauline Trabucco, 85, daughter of the
grocer. "It was in a way very sad."</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe surely would have lived a happier life if he'd never
bought the properties, or had hired someone to manage them, said
Marks, but "he couldn't let go."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Von der Ahe took to showing up at night to raid
Marks' fridge. The pair discussed philosophy, science and family. A
shrewd and honorable businessman, Wilfred Sr.--who died in 1998--had
little patience for his dreamer son.</TE>
<TE>   "In one of his more reflective moods, Wilfred told me his father
looked at him and said, 'You're never going to become successful,' "
Marks said. "It set the stage for some real tragedy.... Wilfred was a
delightful man. A businessman? Boy, was he bad!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still, he kept trying.</TE>
<TE>   After Von der Ahe Jr. was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago,
he seemed to soften. First hospitalized in Fresno, he reconciled with
family and friends he had pushed away. This year, his family moved
him to City of Hope in Duarte, where he rallied after a stem-cell
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   There he sat, his sister recalled in a eulogy here, in a red ski
cap and plaid flannel shirt, surrounded by 14 file boxes stuffed with
his papers and plans for Mariposa.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to seek help with the historic properties. Rep. George
Radanovich, who represents Mariposa, had been urging Von der Ahe to
relinquish control or seek resources to preserve them. The
congressman runs a wine-tasting room in the heart of the historic
district and had eyed the buildings with despair.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in late June, Von der Ahe's body abruptly rejected the
donated stem cells. He was 66.</TE>
<TE>   In death he came full circle, embraced by the world he had
resisted and rejected years before. An old elementary school
classmate, Roger M. Mahony--now a cardinal--said the funeral Mass at
St. Charles Borromeo in North Hollywood, accompanied at the altar by
10 priests. Dolores Hope was among those attending, and a reception
followed at the exclusive Lakeside Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an L.A. funeral for an L.A. family, for a person that
didn't really exist down there," said Dunbar, the Mariposa friend and
advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Radanovich and federal and state historic
preservation officials toured Von der Ahe's properties. It was a
long-planned visit to get improvements rolling. A memorial followed.</TE>
<TE>   The family has declined to discuss the estate or Von der Ahe's
life, saying he would have shunned the attention. But plenty of
questions remain in this mountain town.</TE>
<TE>   "What's in the will? What's going to happen?" said Carol Harner,
whose ranch borders one 2,300-acre Von der Ahe holding. "That's the
big question of the town."</TE>
<TE>   Von der Ahe's rundown properties still dot Mariposa and
surrounding communities. Many residents are eager to see the
buildings sold to individual owners who might kick-start a
desperately needed revival.</TE>
<TE>   Others are urging Von der Ahe's eldest daughter--executor of his
estate--to donate the sites to the county or state. It could take
months before the transfer of the estate, held in trust, is complete.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, this town of 1,373 waits and wonders, its modest
fate in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody would like to know what's going to happen," said Lyn
Maccarone, who owns the restored Mariposa Hotel and Inn next to Von
der Ahe's buildings. "We've been waiting a long time."</TE>

<HD>Train Kills Girl Crossing Tracks</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>An Amtrak train struck and killed a 15-year-old girl Friday as she
attempted to cross tracks while on her way to school, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   April Jefferson was walking with two younger male cousins along
tracks that run beside Lake Pontchartrain. The three had crossed the
tracks earlier so they could walk along the edge of the lake in
eastern New Orleans, said Juan Barnes, a police spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   When they saw the train approaching, they tried to rush back to
the other side of the tracks so they could proceed to school without
having to wait for the train to pass, Barnes said.</LD>
<TE>   The victim's two cousins told police they made it across safely
and turned around to see the girl being hit as she tried to follow,
Barnes said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. No one else was
injured.</TE>
<TE>   The train had just left downtown New Orleans en route to New York.
Barnes said a conductor told him the train was moving about 79 mph,
the normal speed for that section of track.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Charged in Massacre of 6 Family Members in Alabama</HD>
<DH>Crime: Boyfriend of teen who likely witnessed the attack
could face the death penalty. Authorities refuse to comment on a
motive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RUTLEDGE, Ala.</DL>
<LD>An unemployed man was charged Friday with capital murder in the
massacre of six members of his teenage girlfriend's family, whose
bullet-riddled bodies were found at their isolated farm.</LD>
<LD>   Westley Devone Harris, 22, is accused of killing his girlfriend's
three teenage brothers along with her mother, father and grandmother,
authorities said. The rampage stunned and frightened the southern
Alabama crossroads community where they lived.</LD>
<LD>   The capital murder charges carry a possible death sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Harris and his girlfriend, Janice Denise Ball, 16, were sought for
questioning after the first bodies were found Tuesday night. They
turned themselves in to authorities Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, a high school dropout with a crack cocaine case pending
against him, remained at the jail in adjoining Lowndes County.</TE>
<TE>   Ball is considered a witness and was in the care of welfare
officials along with the couple's 1-year-old daughter, said Maj. Ken
Hallford, chief of the Alabama Bureau of Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities declined to comment on a motive or exactly when the
slayings occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the victims were last seen Monday. Bodies of the victims
were found Tuesday and Wednesday: Two at the farmhouse, two in a
nearby mobile home, one at a hog pen and one in a car trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Slain were Mila Ruth Ball, 62; her daughter, Joann Ball, 35;
Willie Hasley, 40, Joann Ball's husband; and their three sons--Jerry
Ball, 18, Tony Ball, 16, and John Ball, 14. Janice Ball also lived at
the homestead with her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman Ball, whose mother and sister were among the victims, said
it appeared the killings occurred Monday evening. He said his mother
was shot to death at the kitchen sink near a chicken she apparently
was about to prepare for that night's meal.</TE>
<TE>   Ball said he was relieved that Janice Ball was likely only a
witness. "I had just prayed to God that she didn't have nothing to do
with this tragedy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several weapons were recovered, but state police Lt. Loyd
Arrington would not say what kinds of weapons or whether they were
used in the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The crime at the homes about 40 miles south of Montgomery is one
of the worst multiple-victim homicides on record in the state. Harris
requested that he be held in Lowndes County out of fear that there
would be relatives or friends of the slain family at the Crenshaw
County Jail, Hallford said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives were able to enter the small, tin-roof home and nearby
trailer Friday to retrieve life insurance policies and other
paperwork needed for a funeral planned for Wednesday at an area high
school.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said they had heard talk of trouble between Harris and
his girlfriend's parents but had not personally witnessed any.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Hasley, brother of Willie Hasley, said there were no signs
of a struggle by the victims. "They were surprised," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Harris was arrested Nov. 2 for
distribution of crack cocaine and was released on $5,000 bond. In
March, he was accused of having a stolen pit bull chained to the
nearby trailer he shared with his girlfriend, but the charge was
dropped after the dog was returned to its owner.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the family were somber as they entered for the first
time the house and trailer on the tree-shaded lot that Mila Ball had
rented since 1988. Chickens pecked around the yard. Hogs and piglets
looked on from behind a fence.</TE>
<TE>   A niece of the grandmother, Aberdean Johnson of Stone Mountain,
Ga., almost fainted as she emerged from the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just numb," she said. "I'm looking for answers and there are
no answers."</TE>

<HD>New Orleans Blaze Kills 40 Pets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>An eight-alarm fire in New Orleans' lower Garden District damaged
eight buildings, leaving several apartment dwellers homeless and
killing an estimated 40 pets.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Suthon, an American Red Cross worker on the scene, estimated
that at least six families lost their homes in the fire, which was
reported about 6:30 a.m. Friday and raged out of control until late
morning, damaging the eight 19th century buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Five firefighters among 110 called to the scene were treated for
minor injuries. All residents and other people reached safety.</LD>
<TE>   Among businesses destroyed was the Cat Practice veterinary office
and a nearby kennel, both packed with pets that had been boarded for
the holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarian Katherine Williams said three of 25 cats were rescued
from the Cat Practice. Most of the 50 cats and dogs in the kennel
were rescued, said Elizabeth Bell, co-owner of the kennel.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous cats belonging to people in the apartments above the
businesses perished.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started on the upper floors of a stained-glass studio and
spread to adjoining buildings, said Roman Nelson, spokesman for the
New Orleans Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The lower Garden District of New Orleans is a historic
neighborhood of 19th century buildings, many of them renovated in
recent years as part of a revitalization project.</TE>

<LD>Clad in white protective suits, investigators set up devices inside
the quarantined former headquarters of the National Enquirer to take
samples and search for clues in last fall's anthrax attack.</LD>
<LD>   The teams of FBI agents and scientists hope to find the letter or
package that brought the anthrax into the Boca Raton building and
fatally infected a photo editor. FBI investigators also want to
compare the anthrax spores found in the American Media Inc. building
to the spores found in letters sent to the Washington offices of
Sens. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</LD>
<LD>   As the trail leading to suspects in the attacks grows colder, the
FBI said it was trying new techniques to search for large quantities
of spores in hopes of finding evidence overlooked before.</LD>

charges that the Army Corps of Engineers improperly granted a permit

<HD>Child Rape Charges Renewed Against Former Boston Priest</HD>
<DH>Courts: A judge reverses her ruling against John J. Geoghan
on lesser counts from a January trial. He is in jail on another
conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A judge here has reinstated child rape charges against former priest
John J. Geoghan, whose January trial on lesser charges set off a
massive sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   In restoring charges that date from the early 1980s, Suffolk
Superior Court Judge Margaret Hinkle reversed her ruling of nearly
six months ago that prosecutors had waited too long to indict Geoghan
on charges of fondling and orally raping a boy who was 7 to 10 years
old. Hinkle offered no explanation for her unusual ruling, and
prosecutors would not discuss the case.</LD>
<LD>   Geoghan, 66, is serving a nine-to 10-year prison sentence for
fondling a boy 10 years ago at a community swimming pool. His lawyer,
Geoffrey Packard, vowed to appeal the ruling posted late Thursday on
a court computer docket.</LD>
<TE>   Documents published in the Boston Globe in conjunction with the
Geoghan case revealed that church officials assigned the priest to
work with children despite numerous abuse accusations against him.
The Boston archdiocese had no comment Friday about the reinstatement
of child rape charges against Geoghan, who also is named in at least
86 civil lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan's trial on the reinstated charges could begin as early as
October.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Saviano, director of the Massachusetts office of the
Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, on Friday welcomed
Hinkle's decision to reinstate rape charges against Geoghan.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges he was convicted on this past winter are relatively
minor, and they do not at all represent the true nature of his
crimes," Saviano said. "So I am pleased that Hinkle has had a change
of heart."</TE>
<TE>   He said the judge's decision also "shows the issue is very much
alive." But as another judge on Friday expressed "significant
concerns" about the credibility of sexual abuse allegations against
two other priests, Saviano conceded that false accusations are a
potential risk in a scandal that has grown so large.</TE>
<TE>   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney voiced her
reservations after a lawyer representing an alleged abuse victim
asked to withdraw from the case. In his motion, attorney Eric J.
Parker said "issues arose central to the allegations" by his client,
Paul Edwards, against Msgr. Michael Smith Foster and the late Father
William J. Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, who did not specify in his motion what the issues were,
was not available for comment. His withdrawal from the case could
result in dismissal of charges against Foster, 47, who was placed on
leave after Edwards filed suit against him.</TE>
<TE>   Father Robert Bullock, chairman of the Boston Priests' Forum, said
Friday that Foster was a victim of a zero-tolerance policy that often
fails to take the rights of priests into account.</TE>
<TE>   "There is often a rush to judgment of these priests. There is a
presumption of guilt. The priests are not informed of their canonical
rights," said Bullock, whose organization represents 250 of the 622
active priests in the Boston archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a priest is removed in this quick process, a document
goes out, an ice-cold, formal statement from the archdiocese,"
Bullock said. "It is a template, and the latest priest's name is
filled in."</TE>
<TE>   Bullock, a priest in Sharon, Mass., south of Boston, added, "This
in no way minimizes the enormity of crimes that have been committed,
or the tragedy that survivors and their families have experienced.
However, our argument is not about guilt or innocence. Our argument
is about process. The rights of many priests are not being
respected."</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the motion to dismiss charges against Foster is
scheduled for Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>17 Cuban Migrants Left Abandoned on an Island</HD>
<DH>Bahamas: Group headed for the U.S. was stranded by
smugglers with little food or water, Coast Guard says. All are said
to be in good health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Smugglers abandoned 17 Cuban migrants, including two children, on a
remote Bahamian island with little food and water, the U.S. Coast
Guard said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cubans were rescued from Cay Sal, an uninhabited island in the
Florida Straits about 60 miles north of Cuba, by a Coast Guard cutter
Tuesday after they were spotted by an air patrol.</LD>
<LD>   They were in good health although they had run out of food and
water, a Coast Guard statement said.</LD>
<TE>   The migrants--12 men, three women and two children--said they left
Cuba on a 30-foot vessel Aug. 22. A smuggler dropped them off on Cay
Sal and said he would come back after refueling. He never returned.</TE>
<TE>   "Abandoning these migrants with little food or water and leaving
them is a grossly inhumane act," Coast Guard Lt. Tony Russell said.
"Smugglers have no regard for the well-being of their human cargo,
only their own financial gain."</TE>
<TE>   The rescued Cubans were taken to Freeport on Grand Bahama Island.
Summer weather has brought an increase in attempts by Cubans to leave
their Communist-ruled homeland, although numbers are far fewer than
in recent years. According to the latest Coast Guard figures, 427
Cubans have been intercepted at sea since May, compared with 1,650
between May and August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At least one recent attempt ended in tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   A boat carrying as many as 25 migrants that left Bahia Honda,
Cuba, on Aug. 18 disappeared. Four bodies believed to be those of
passengers were found off the Florida coast this week.</TE>
<TE>   Six migrants in two boats were intercepted just a mile off the
Florida coast near Lake Worth on Thursday, the Coast Guard said.
Three suspected smugglers were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Cubans trying to reach the United States have increasingly turned
to smugglers in recent years, paying $1,000 or more for the voyage.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard Capt. Wayne Justice said the smugglers were becoming
more reckless, overloading boats and setting out with disregard for
sea and weather conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-three would-be migrants were repatriated by the Coast Guard
on Friday to Bahia de Cabanas, Cuba. They were picked up in seven
recent incidents. Nearly all had set out on rafts.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban migrants reaching American shores are permitted to stay in
the country, but those who are intercepted at sea are usually shipped
home.</TE>

<LD>While the U.S. government builds its case that four Detroit-area Arab
men allegedly conspired to engage in a "global jihad," or Islamic
holy war, leaders of the country's largest Arab American community

access to passenger jetliners.</LD>
<LD>   But the government "has failed to prove one single case to the
American public, and it is very hard to swallow these allegations as
a community," said Imad Hamad, Midwest regional director of the
American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Dearborn, Mich., a
suburb of Detroit with a large Arab American population.</LD>
<TE>   "Any closed hearings where people are denied the basic opportunity
of legal counsel to help them deal with serious allegations of that
nature continue to be questionable," Hamad said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office and the FBI said Wednesday that a grand
jury--an impaneled body that hears evidence behind closed doors--had
returned indictments against the four men on charges of conspiracy to
support terrorists, and of producing and misusing fraudulent visas
and other identification documents. Three of the men are in custody
and the fourth, whose full name is not known, is still at large.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments, which came nearly a year after the three now in
jail were arrested the week after the Sept. 11 attacks, sparked
renewed concern that Arab American communities are still viewed with
suspicion about having ties to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   About 200,000 people of Arab descent live in the Detroit area,
where the heaviest concentration is in Dearborn, about 12 miles west
of downtown Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling in our community of being a victim, which is a
painful experience after Sept. 11," said Mohammad Ali Elahi, the
founding imam of the mosque at the Islamic House of Wisdom Dearborn
Heights, which adjoins Dearborn.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners in American jails come from all varieties of ethnic
communities, "but if any happen to be an Arab person, there is a rush
to judgment that there is a terrorist connection," he said. "We need
to reach out and build bridges for better dialogue among different
communities."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment identifies the four men as Karim Koubriti and Ahmad
Hannan, originally from Morocco; Algerian-born Farouk Ali-Haimoud,
and a man known only as Abdella, whose age and background are not
known.</TE>
<TE>   The men operated as a "covert underground support unit for
terrorist attacks" and conspired to provide "material support and
resources" for carrying out assaults against the U.S. air base in
Incirlik, Turkey, a hospital in Amman, Jordan, and targets in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   They "were involved in plans to obtain weaponry to benefit
operatives overseas, to recruit persons for violent activity, to
arrange for the entry of recruits into the United States where they
would be trained for global jihad, and to arrange false
identification to facilitate such entry and training."</TE>
<TE>   The men moved into an apartment together in Dearborn in June 2001,
along with an unidentified individual they tried to recruit "to
participate in the global jihad against states that were not
sufficiently Islamic"--namely Jordan, Turkey and the United States.
They also wanted the unnamed individual to bring in other members to
the cell, according to the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   Although the unnamed person is identified only as "an individual"
repeatedly in the U.S. attorney's charges, it is believed to be
Youssef Hmimssa, who is named on the first page of the indictment but
was not charged along with the other four. Ali-Haimoud's attorney,
Kevin Ernst, said in interviews with local newspapers this week that
the government built its case on the allegations of "one
snitch"--Hmimssa--who is accusing the others to protect himself.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst, who did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment, was
quoted as saying that federal agents had built a bogus case out of
desperation to show progress in the fight against terrorism as the
first anniversary of last year's attacks neared.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst's comments are "purposefully inflammatory; it's intended to
inflame the citizenry," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard Convertino,
the government's chief prosecutor in the case who signed the
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations of ethnic profiling are "unwarranted, uncalled for
and absolutely without merit," he said. "The efforts undertaken
nationally speak for themselves," Convertino said, declining to
comment further, citing a gag rule issued by U.S. District Judge
Gerald Rosen.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Hannan and Hmimssa did not return phone calls Friday
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hannan, Koubriti and Ali-Haimoud traveled frequently to Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, "where they attempted to locate security
breaches that would allow them to, among other things, directly
access airliners," the indictment says. From May to July of last
year, Hannan and Koubriti worked for a vendor at the airport, and
Ali-Haimoud worked at an airport store from February to April of this
year, it says.</TE>
<TE>   The three disguised their plans by using a "mentally unstable man"
to sign notebooks containing sketches of the U.S. base in Turkey and
the hospital in Jordan to make it appear that the notebooks belonged
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this period, they acted on orders from Abdella, who
instructed them to communicate in code, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents raided the apartment of the three on Sept. 17, less
than a week after the attacks on New York's World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, and found among other items a videotape "that appears
to depict surveillance of such U.S. landmarks" as Disneyland in
Anaheim and the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, the U.S. says.</TE>
<TE>   Arab Americans in the Detroit area have complained that they have
been subject to unjustified suspicion since September, saying they
have been singled out because of their ethnicity at airport security
lines or by police making traffic stops.</TE>
<TE>   However, anti-discrimination activist Hamad praised the U.S.
attorney's office and the FBI, with whom he meets every month along
with representatives of U.S. customs, the Secret Service, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms--meetings that Hamad says have greatly improved
relations between the Arab American community and local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   John Bell Jr., the head of Detroit's FBI office, even visited
Hamad recently to congratulate him on his swearing-in next month as a
U.S. citizen, bringing a souvenir FBI cap, key chain and coffee mug.</TE>
<TE>   "We must not have the community surrender to fear and
intimidation," Hamad said. "But John Bell has been very candid, and
that's the true American way."</TE>

<HD>Drought Emergency Declared in Virginia</HD>
<DH>Water: The governor issues a state ban on watering lawns,
washing cars and filling pools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>Virginia Gov. Mark Warner on Friday declared a state of emergency
because of the ongoing drought and banned lawn watering and car
washing in most parts of the state.</LD>
<LD>   "My hope, my prayer, is that these actions, combined with a little
more rain, will end the need for these restrictions," Warner said at
a news conference. "My concern is that the rains of the last few days
may make people say that the crisis is gone. The crisis is not gone."</LD>
<LD>   Warner joined Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening in imposing water
restrictions after weeks of saying that water usage was best
controlled by local governments, not state officials.</LD>
<TE>   But Warner said the drought, combined with stories of two small
towns in central Virginia running out of water, convinced him that it
was time to act broadly.</TE>
<TE>   The new state restrictions supersede local measures, unless
localities have imposed stricter rules. For most state residents,
that means they may not water their lawns, wash their cars or fill
swimming pools. Warner on Friday urged local water authorities to
impose financial penalties on people who ignore the rules, but he
said the state will not seek to enforce the restrictions on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "We can live with the fact that our grass may die," Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   The state rules do not ban watering of gardens or bushes, which
Warner said could be very costly to replace if they die. And car wash
facilities may continue to operate. But golf course owners may water
their greens and tees only at night.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of far southwest Virginia, which has had more-frequent
thunderstorms during the summer, are exempt from the new
restrictions. The restrictions apply based on which river basin
communities get their water from.</TE>
<TE>   Most Northern Virginians also are not subject to the restrictions.
Residents in those communities get their water from the Potomac
River, which can be augmented by two large reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   But Warner warned that he may expand the ban to include Northern
Virginia if the drought persists.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Grammy-winning singer R. Kelly, who has been free on bond since he
was indicted on child pornography charges, can leave the state to
make two public appearances in Florida this weekend, a judge ruled
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Vincent Michael Gaughan ordered him to surrender his
passport and refrain from any illegal contact with minors.</LD>
<LD>   Court documents show Kelly, who doesn't like to fly, planned to
travel by private bus. The singer was scheduled to appear tonight at
Krave nightclub in Miami Beach and host a "celebrity pool party" at
Shelborne Resort on Sunday, the records show.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly, 35, whose first name is Robert, was indicted by a Cook
County grand jury June 5 on 21 counts of child pornography stemming
from a videotape authorities say shows Kelly having sex with a
13-year-old girl.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Allows Scientists to See Kennewick Man Before Burial</HD>
<DH>Courts: A U.S. judge grants access to a 9,300-year-old
skeleton found in Washington before it is released to its tribal
descendants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ordered Friday that before five Northwest Indian
tribes can hold sacred burial services for a 9,300-year-old skeleton
discovered near Kennewick, Wash., the bones should be handed over to
a group of scientists who want to get a closer look at him.</LD>
<LD>   Known as Kennewick Man, the skeleton was found by a pair of boat
racers on the banks of the Columbia River in July 1996. A preliminary
exam showed he was almost completely intact, save for a few missing
molars.</LD>
<LD>   Eight scientists filed suit to conduct further studies, saying
Kennewick Man may reveal that humans arrived in North America by way
of a land bridge from Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's decision by U.S. Magistrate John Jelderks overturned last
year's decision by the Department of the Interior that said oral
history showed the skeleton to be a sacred ancestor known as "The
Ancient One" to the Colville, Umatilla, Yakama, Nez Perce and Wanapum
tribes. Under that decision, the bones are protected under the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act 1990, which says
remains found on aboriginal lands of a modern tribe must be given to
the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   But in his ruling, Jelderks wrote that there was "nothing I have
found in a careful examination of the administrative record" that
would support the government's decision to deny a scientific
examination.</TE>
<TE>   "Allowing study is fully consistent with applicable statutes and
regulations, which are clearly intended to make archeological
information available to the public through scientific research," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Perino, spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said
government attorneys would have to review the ruling before they
could comment.</TE>
<TE>   As for the scientists, they were eager to assert that the desire
to look at Kennewick Man is purely scientific.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Native Americans see it differently, but this suit was
against the government, not the Indian tribes," said anthropologist
Richard Jantz at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and one of
the eight scientists.</TE>

<HD>New Prescription Drug Plan Facing Same Old Opposition</HD>
<DH>Health: Retailers fear White House's discount card for
seniors would shift sales to mail order.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Friday rolled out a revised proposal for a
Medicare-endorsed discount card to help seniors save money on
prescription drugs, but opposition from chain drugstores and
pharmacists again threatens to kill it.</LD>
<LD>   A government-endorsed discount card could produce average annual
savings of $170 for as many as 10 million elderly or disabled
beneficiaries, and "that is not chicken feed," said Tom Scully,
administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</LD>
<LD>   But even if the plan does survive legal challenges, he said it
will not meet the growing demand for full Medicare drug coverage.</LD>
<TE>   "The bottom line," Scully said, "is this is not going to fix
seniors' drug problems."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, senior citizens would pay as much as $25 to get
one of several Medicare-endorsed private drug-discount cards. The
endorsed cards, unlike some discount cards offered by drug
manufacturers, would be available to all Medicare beneficiaries
regardless of income.</TE>
<TE>   Presented with a prescription at a pharmacy or as part of a mail
order, the card would entitle the beneficiary to get drugs at 10% to
13% below the normal price.</TE>
<TE>   The savings would come not from government subsidies but from
discounts and rebates the private card providers negotiate with drug
manufacturers and pass on to senior citizens, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Card providers also would have to publish on the Internet their
prices on a minimum of 119 drugs. Scully said this pricing
"transparency" would enable senior citizens to shop around for the
card that offers the best prices and, in turn, that process would
foster competition among card providers and drive prices even lower.</TE>
<TE>   Key to concerns about the discount card proposal is the
government's role in administering it. The Bush administration
insists the card is not a new government program, which would require
congressional authorization, but rather a "market-driven" program
organized by the government.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores, along with the National
Community Pharmacists Assn., sued in federal district court last year
to block the Medicare card, arguing that the CMS had exceeded its
constitutional authority.</TE>
<TE>   A federal district judge agreed and stopped the Bush
administration from implementing the plan. Late last year, the judge
allowed the administration to try again, if this time it went through
the normal, public rule-making process.</TE>
<TE>   But in February, when the administration unveiled a preliminary
proposal and invited public comment, the trade groups again
registered their objections in court.</TE>
<TE>   Although the final rules unveiled by the administration Friday
appear to be more favorable to drugstores, the group remained
unappeased.</TE>
<TE>   The trade groups see in the plan a collusion between the Bush
administration and pharmacy benefit managers, the private companies
that administer the prescription-drug portion of health insurance
policies. They are particularly concerned that the program would take
prescription drug business away from drugstores and shift it toward
mail-order purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "Retail pharmacy doesn't want to bear the cost of this program,"
said Crystal Wright, a spokeswoman for the drugstores.</TE>
<TE>   The elderly use more prescription drugs than any other segment of
the population. But Medicare, the program for 40 million older and
disabled Americans, does not cover drugs that are taken outside of a
hospital stay.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the plan now lies with U.S. District Judge Paul
Friedman, who could rule on its legality sometime in the new few
months, or with Congress, which could clarify the CMS' authority with
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the House Medicare reform bill authorizes such a program,
and some Senate proposals--all of which failed last month to gain
enough votes to proceed--also included provisions for a temporary
discount card.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is definitely in play in Senate legislation," said Paul
Cotton, an AARP Medicare specialist.</TE>
<TE>   That advocacy group, which represents 35 million Americans age 50
and older, endorses the discount card as a "building block" toward a
comprehensive Medicare drug benefit, Cotton said.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Tops the Agenda of U.S. Islamic Gathering</HD>
<DH>Conference: Prayers for victims, Muslims targeted after
attacks lead off D.C. meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The largest annual gathering of American Muslims began Friday with
prayers for victims of Sept. 11 and for Muslims who have been
harassed since the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Muhammad Nur Abdullah, president of the Islamic Society of North
America, said in his opening address that Islam condemns violence and
that Muslims, like others in the United States, want the terrorists
to be punished. "We're for justice," said Abdullah, a St. Louis imam,
standing on a stage flanked by U.S. flags. "This is our country.
American Muslims, we care for the betterment of this country and for
every human being."</LD>
<LD>   Khadija Abdullah of Los Angeles read a prayer she wrote for those
who died in the suicide strikes, thanking God for the efforts of the
rescue workers and for the "comfort and courage" that victims gave
their families in their final phone calls. She also urged Muslims to
"answer scapegoating and hatred" with love.</LD>
<TE>   The effect of the attacks is a central theme of the conference,
the most important U.S. Muslim meeting this year. Up to 30,000 people
are expected at the four-day event, run by the Islamic Society.</TE>
<TE>   It is the first time the convention--in its 39th year--is being
held in the nation's capital and comes as Muslims seek a greater
public voice in what for many is their adopted country.</TE>
<TE>   They have taken pains since the hijackings to proclaim their
loyalty to the U.S., even as critics--including the Rev. Franklin
Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham--condemned the religion as
evil.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based
advocacy group, has received 2,000 reports of harassment of Muslims
since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting's opening prayer was a verse from the Koran that urges
Muslims to "stand firm for Allah" and "let not the hatred of others
... make you deviate from justice."</TE>
<TE>   The conference will touch on many facets of Muslim life, including
health care, parenting, charter schools and investing. Muslim law
restricts how much profit may be made on investments.</TE>
<TE>   Marriage also will be on the agenda. Families seeking spouses for
their children will have the chance to meet face-to-face through a
marriage service.</TE>
<TE>   The National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom, including the
National Lawyers Guild and the American Muslim Council, has scheduled
a rally Sunday at Freedom Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The event will end with a discussion of political strategy. Muslim
groups made their first collective endorsement of a presidential
candidate in the 2000 race, when they backed George W. Bush.</TE>

<HD>Md. Has First West Nile Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BETHESDA, Md.</DL>
<LD>Maryland reported its first death from West Nile virus Friday, and
Nebraska officials said they also may have seen their first fatality.</LD>
<LD>   Ten other states have reported deaths from the mosquito-borne
disease this summer, as it spread across most of the Lower 48 states.</LD>
<LD>   Elsie C. Karo, 87, of Bethesda died Tuesday at the Hospice of
Washington after being hospitalized with encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain. She tested positive for the virus, health officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In Nebraska, initial tests show a 69-year-old man who died Aug. 22
had the virus, said Steve Beal, assistant health director of the
Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Officials were waiting
for confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Nebraska and Maryland victims had other health problems,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, the CDC had recorded 555 human cases, including 28
fatalities, of West Nile this year in 26 states and Washington, D.C.
Including animal cases, the virus has been seen in 41 states.</TE>
<TE>   Two states Friday reported their first human cases of the disease.
A 30-year-old woman in South Carolina was recovering, but a
Connecticut man in his 70s was hospitalized in serious condition,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile appeared in the United States in 1999, when a New York
outbreak killed seven people and infected 62.</TE>
<TE>   Most people bitten by an infected mosquito never get sick, and
most of the rest see only symptoms similar to the flu. A small
percentage of people contract encephalitis, a potentially fatal
infection of the brain.</TE>

<HD>Corrosion at Nuclear Plant Opens Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators are investigating whether the owner of a nuclear
plant where acid nearly ate through a 6-inch-thick steel reactor cap
had altered records about the damage, the company says.</LD>
<LD>   FirstEnergy Corp. spokesman Todd Schneider said Friday the utility
was cooperating with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but would not
provide details of the investigation at the Davis-Besse plant near
Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   The plant has been shut down since engineers discovered in March
that boric acid had nearly eaten through the steel cap on the reactor
vessel. It was the most extensive corrosion found on a U.S. nuclear
reactor, and led to a nationwide review of all 69 similar plants.</LD>

<HD>FAA Orders Boeing Jet Inspections</HD>
<DH>Safety: Agency calls on airlines to check for potentially
faulty fuel pumps in 1,440 planes that might lead to an explosion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to inspect 1,440 Boeing
jets to determine if they have a potentially faulty fuel pump that
could cause an explosion.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration's emergency order stressed
that no serious incidents have been linked to problems with the
pumps, which are made by Hydro-Aire Inc. of Burbank, Calif., and were
installed in January and April on Boeing 737s, 747s and 757s.</LD>
<LD>   The airlines were given four days to inspect their fleets. The FAA
estimated 1,250 pumps could have a problem with wires that were
placed too close to a rotor and can chafe. Since one plane can have
several pumps, it was not immediately clear how many aircraft might
have the flaw.</LD>
<TE>   Ron Wojnar, the FAA's deputy director of aircraft certification
services, said any airlines that installed Hydro-Aire's pumps in the
Boeing models since January are being ordered to keep enough fuel in
the tanks to cover the devices even when the planes bank or encounter
turbulence in flight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an unsafe condition," he said, explaining that the
submersion would prevent any sparks from igniting fuel vapors.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that an explosion
in the center fuel tank of TWA Flight 800 caused it to crash off the
coast of Long Island in 1996. It said vapors in the partly empty tank
probably were ignited by a spark in wiring.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded in a fireball at 13,700 feet,
minutes after leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport. All 230
people on board were killed. "All of our pumps that were on Flight
800 were recovered and not found to be contributors to the crash,"
said Greg Ward, president of Hydro-Aire.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA's inspection order affects 515 of the 737s, 247 of the
747s and 678 of the 757s operated by U.S. carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign airlines operate about 2,100 of the jets. The FAA is
sending advisories about the pumps to its counterpart agencies in
those countries.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA will issue a follow-up directive in a few weeks,
instructing carriers to repair or replace any faulty pumps, Wojnar
said.</TE>
<TE>   The pumps are located in the center fuel tank under the fuselage.
Some planes may also have pumps in wing tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing spokeswoman Liz Verdier said her company sent the airlines
a bulletin Wednesday ordering the pumps replaced on 116 new planes
that had been put into use this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ward said the problem appears to have occurred while the pumps
were being assembled. Hydro-Aire, meanwhile, has X-rayed all of the
pumps that had not yet been shipped to Boeing--about 150 pumps--and
found about 3% contained the wiring problem, Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   He said one pump that the company took apart after it was returned
by an airline contained a wire that had been rubbed by a nearby
rotor, creating concern of a potential spark.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have fuel covering the pump there's no oxygen, so there
can be no fire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other 737s, 747s and 757s were ordered to fly only with their
tanks full enough to cover the pumps until further inspections, said
Boeing's Verdier.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was detected on three planes that had pumps short out
and stop working, giving the crew an indication of low pressure in
the tank, said FAA spokesman Les Dorr.</TE>
<TE>   The British carrier EasyJet sent the pump back to Hydro-Aire on
Aug. 12 after the crew of one of its Boeing 737s detected low
pressure, Dorr said. A week later, a Northwest Airlines 747-400
reported a low pressure indication and found the same problem, he
said.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The state added $66,000 to fines against Mount Sinai Hospital and
prolonged the suspension of its live-donor liver transplant program
after finding 33 patient-care violations, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   New York state Health Commissioner Antonia Novello cited the
"severity and widespread impact" of the violations in lengthening the
suspension.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital's adult liver transplant program was suspended
following the January death of a 57-year-old donor a few days after
surgery. The suspension was to expire Sept. 12, but with the new
violations, the hospital must submit a correction plan and pass a new
inspection. State officials said they didn't know how long that would
take.</LD>
<TE>   The inquiry, the department's longest investigation of a hospital,
was continuing. The hospital said in a statement that most of the
problems identified by the state occurred before 2002 and have been
corrected.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Disappearance of Utah Teenager Dies</HD>
<DH>Crime: Richard Ricci, who police hoped could lead them to
Elizabeth Smart, had brain injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A suspect in the kidnapping of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart died
Friday at a hospital three days after suffering from a brain
hemorrhage and collapsing in his jail cell, doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Friday, doctors said Richard Albert Ricci, 48, had an
irreversible injury to the brain stem after the hemorrhage Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   He had not been listed as brain dead because he could breathe on
his own, although he was on a ventilator, Dr. Richard J. Sperry said.</LD>
<TE>   Ricci's family, including his wife, Angela, and his mother,
brother and sister, decided to take Ricci off life support, doctors
at University of Utah Hospital said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Ricci's death could make it difficult to find
Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci, a former handyman for the Smart family, was not charged in
the disappearance and denied involvement. He was in prison for a
parole violation.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse reaffirmed this week that
Ricci remained at the top of the list of potential suspects in
Elizabeth's abduction. But investigators were no closer to finding
the missing girl than they were June 5, when a gunman took her from
the bedroom she shared with her sister.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Elizabeth's family offered $3,000 in rewards for
information on who picked up Ricci when he left his Jeep Cherokee at
a repair shop June 8, three days after the abduction, and information
regarding a July 24 attempted break-in at the home of Elizabeth's
aunt.</TE>
<TE>   A $250,000 reward was posted in June for information leading to
Elizabeth's safe recovery. A separate $25,000 reward was offered for
information leading to finding her or contributing to the arrest and
conviction of her abductor. Neither has been claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's disappearance was one of several abductions of
children this summer around the U.S. that have frightened parents.</TE>

<HD>Nerve Illness Spreads to 10th State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Animal-health officials on Friday confirmed Minnesota's first case of
chronic wasting disease, marking the spread of the incurable illness
into a 10th state.</LD>
<LD>   The state Board of Animal Health said a farm-raised elk tested
positive after dying mysteriously. The rest of the Aitkin County herd
has been quarantined.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they didn't know the source of the infection. They
didn't say how many animals were in the herd.</LD>
<TE>   Chronic wasting disease destroys the brain in deer, elk, moose and
caribou and causes the animal to grow thin and die. Once found only
in a small area of Colorado and Wyoming, the illness has spread
through elk ranches and wild deer and elk herds as far away as
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   In efforts to contain the disease, thousands of captive elk have
been slaughtered in Colorado and hundreds of deer have been killed in
Wisconsin. The disease has also been found in New Mexico, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum told federal officials
that a third of hunters may skip this season over fears about the
safety of deer meat, jeopardizing his state's battle to control the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   McCallum sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman, urging her agency to "get off the dime" and approve a rapid
test for the disease and certify private labs so they can also do
testing.</TE>
<TE>   Although experts say there is no evidence that chronic wasting
disease can infect humans, the World Health Organization warns
against eating any part of a deer with signs of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials in Minnesota and Wisconsin, meanwhile, are
investigating the deaths of three men, two from Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease and the other from Pick's disease, another neurological
illness. Some fear that chronic wasting disease could eventually show
up in humans as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</TE>
<TE>   The men knew each other and ate at wild-game feasts hosted by one
of them.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Strike Is Averted</HD>
<DH>Labor: Owners and players talk until hours before game time
to produce first deal without a work stoppage since 1972.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It wasn't over until it was over, and by then, time was nearly out.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for Major League Baseball and its players worked
through the night before reaching agreement on a new labor contract
Friday morning, less than four hours before players were scheduled to
take the field--or not--in the first game threatened by a strike.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals, two teams that should
benefit from cash-sharing provisions of the deal, began on schedule
at 12:20 p.m. PDT after the two weary sides reached their first
collective bargaining agreement without a work stoppage since 1972.
The deal extends through 2006.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called the four-year deal
"historic" and said it would help ensure the health of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the agreement grants a reprieve to two teams
previously condemned to elimination, the Montreal Expos and Minnesota
Twins. Through the 2006 season, no major league team will be forced
to fold.</TE>
<TE>   Team owners and Major League Baseball Players Assn. chief Don Fehr
echoed Selig's sentiment in a joint news conference near Major League
Baseball headquarters on Park Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "All streaks come to an end," Fehr said, and baseball's skein of
strikes "was one that was overdue to come to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Fans, many of whom had promised their own strike if the players
walked, greeted news of the deal with slightly jaundiced relief.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both a bunch of babies," said Beth Keith, 27, who was
attending the Cub-Cardinal game at Chicago's Wrigley Field and had
nothing good to say about either side. "This was all over a luxury
tax. Stupid."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to be at the game," added her friend, Jen Fitzgerald,
25, "but we were going to take the day off anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the two sides had bargained until about 2 a.m. Friday,
after which the sides left the table for internal meetings, union
sources said. There were several other early morning sessions, during
which owners and players responded to counteroffers. The final
economic hurdle of a luxury tax on the wealthiest teams was cleared
in a meeting that lasted more than two hours.</TE>
<TE>   The sides reached agreement shortly before 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Selig and Fehr, two of professional sport's most powerful leaders,
presided over the final session as the deal was finalized, ending
talks that had resumed after the All-Star break. The deal should be
ratified within a week, Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 strike lasted 232 days and wiped out the playoffs and
World Series for the first time since 1904, and Selig and Fehr were
determined not to travel a similar path despite their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that makes me the happiest," Selig said, "is that we
can now, once again, turn our complete attention to the field."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr said he suspected the fans would rather be watching players
"than watching pictures of Bud or pictures of me."</TE>
<TE>   Most players and fans had gone to bed Thursday expecting that they
would awake to news of either a deal or a strike. Some players had
already emptied their lockers and bought plane tickets home. By late
Thursday night, however, negotiators were saying they hoped to reach
an agreement by 4 a.m. PDT.</TE>
<TE>   That was assumed to be the deadline--the hour at which the Boston
Red Sox would need to board a bus to catch a plane to their game in
Cleveland. If there was no deal, there would be no bus.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the bus was delayed while the two sides worked out the
final details.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all excited and happy we got this done with," said Atlanta
Brave pitcher Tom Glavine, the National League representative to the
union's executive board. "We don't have to go through the uncertainty
of another work stoppage and what it does to the game and how it
affects the fans of the game. We're all relieved it's behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Owners reacted similarly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is incredible news for the Dodger organization, the game of
baseball and all of our wonderful fans," Chairman Bob Daly said.
"This has been a season full of excitement, and I am pleased that it
will be played in its entirety. We were able to work through the
remaining differences and now have an agreement that will hopefully
benefit everyone involved and help ensure the longevity of this great
pastime."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, a former owner of the Texas Rangers, praised the
agreement through a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time when Americans everywhere are looking forward to
the pennant races heating up, they're looking forward to the march
toward the playoffs and the World Series," said deputy White House
spokesman Scott McClellan, briefing reporters in Crawford, Texas.
"And the President is pleased that the American people and baseball
fans everywhere will be able to continue participating in our
national pastime."</TE>
<TE>   The president had called on the two sides to reach a deal in part
to lift the nation's spirits before the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Brett Butler, a former Dodger
centerfielder who was involved in the 1994 strike negotiations, said
he thought that played a role.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners didn't win, the players didn't win, the fans won,"
Butler told CNN. "Both sides have looked at society, at Sept. 11, at
what's going on with the stock market, and realized this is not about
us anymore. This is for the fans and for the country. They had to put
their differences aside and think about America."</TE>
<TE>   Management gained major concessions from the players' association,
which was concerned that a strike could cause weaker clubs to fold,
costing jobs. The owners won a combination of a payroll tax and
increased revenue sharing, both designed to benefit small-and
mid-market teams while slowing the growth of salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Players, who on Aug. 16 set the strike date, threatened to stop
playing because of concern that the combination of increased revenue
sharing and a stiff tax on the payrolls of high-revenue clubs would
be tantamount to a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Owners made significant concessions on economic issues and agreed
to spare any major league team from elimination through at least the
2006 season, an important issue to the players, who were concerned
about the loss of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom praised the agreement but said
he thought the players gave up more than the owners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win-win for all sides, but we gave a lot, and they gave a
little," he said. "For us to even get involved in a luxury tax is a
huge concession on our part, but we did it. It's going to be a very
interesting four years. The owners got a big bite with drug testing,
with the luxury tax, with revenue sharing, but we don't have anything
to grumble about.... I think we did a great deed for the fans."</TE>
<TE>   The sides had earlier reached agreement on random steroid testing,
raising the minimum salary from $200,000 to $300,000 and improving
the pension plan. That allowed negotiators to focus on the big-ticket
issues. As it turned out, they needed every minute they could get.</TE>
<TE>   Selig and Fehr declined to discuss details, but sources said
high-revenue teams will have to share much more of their local
revenue than they do now, and a tax will be levied on them to
encourage spending restraint.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of money transferred from the high-revenue to
low-revenue clubs will increase from $169 million in 2003 to $258
million in 2006, based on 2001 revenue figures, once revenue sharing
is fully implemented under a phased-in plan. The luxury tax will
start in 2003 for teams with payrolls over $117 million. The figure
will increase to $120.5 million in 2004, $128 million in 2005 and
$136.5 million in 2006. Taxes will range from 17.5% to 40% of the
amount above the threshold.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides don't come to an agreement on a new labor
contract by the expiration of this one, at the end of 2006, the
bargain calls for revenue sharing and the luxury tax to continue for
another year, at levels that have been predetermined but not
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Middle-of-the-pack teams in terms of local revenue, such as the
Angels, should benefit the most under the new deal, receiving bigger
infusions of cash from teams above them. The New York Yankees, in a
role reversal, are the big losers.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees generate the most revenue in baseball--$242 million
last year--and are the only team certain to be over the tax threshold
next season. They estimate it could cost them $50 million or more.
Three other teams stand a chance of reaching it--the Dodgers, Rangers
and Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   In an odd confluence of interests, the union wound up on the side
of the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, whose deep pockets have helped
push salaries up throughout baseball. Ultimately, though, union
leaders decided the issue wasn't reason enough to shut down the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very long time since a collective bargaining
agreement in baseball has been negotiated without a work stoppage,"
Fehr said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can now hope for is that it will be a very long time
before a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated after a work
stoppage."</TE>

<HD>Masters Drops TV Ads Over Pressure to Admit Women</HD>
<DH>Golf: Augusta National says tournament will go
commercial-free amid membership debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Augusta National Golf Club, which runs the Masters, one of the
world's most prestigious golf tournaments, announced Friday that it
would forgo commercial television sponsorship in order to avoid
pressure from women's groups to admit female members to the club.</LD>
<LD>   The unprecedented step will make the Masters a commercial-free
event on network television. CBS has been the principal broadcaster
of the event for many years.</LD>
<LD>   In a faxed statement, Hootie Johnson, chairman of the Georgia
club, said a women's group that had been in touch with the club
earlier was now urging the tournament's corporate sponsors--who also
are the television advertisers--to pressure the club to invite women
as members.</LD>
<TE>   Augusta National has no official policy that excludes women but
has never had a female member. It admitted its first African American
member in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said it was unfair to put the Masters' media sponsors in
the position of having to deal with such pressure, so he notified
Citigroup, IBM and Coca-Cola--the only sponsors for the April 2003
tournament--that their support would not be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have told our media sponsors that we will not request their
participation," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The first salvo of the club's battle with women was fired in June,
when Martha Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, took issue with the lack of female members at Augusta
National, which has been the site of the Masters since it began in
1934.</TE>
<TE>   Burk urged him to open the club to female members before next
year's tournament to avoid having tournament sponsors associated with
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson waited a few weeks, then fired off a strongly worded
response to Burk and released it to the media at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-page statement, Johnson called Burk's letter "coercive"
and said, "We do not intend to be a trophy in their display case."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson insisted that the club would eventually admit women
members, but on the club's timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at the point of a bayonet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 12 1/2 hours of the Masters are televised by the USA Network
and CBS. The club already exercises unusual control over the
telecasts--it must approve the announcers and it sharply limits the
amount of time during each broadcast that can be devoted to
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Under their contracts with the club, the networks are permitted
only four minutes of commercial air time each hour. The normal figure
is 16 minutes of commercial time an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of commercial air time for the Masters is not known, but
some estimates reach $75,000 a minute.</TE>
<TE>   With no sponsors next year, Augusta National, which has about 300
members, apparently is prepared to absorb the financial loss,
according to a source familiar with the arrangement. It is also
probable, another source familiar with sports broadcasting suggested,
that the club would waive its rights fee to CBS--the amount it
charges the network for the right to televise the tournament--to
offset any losses the network might incur, such as in production
costs.</TE>
<TE>   CBS spokeswoman Robin Brendle had no comment on Friday's
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "The club sells a few shirts and a few tickets, so it's not as if
going without TV sponsors for a year is going to break them," said a
source in the golf industry, one of a number of people contacted
Friday who were unwilling to be quoted by name because of the
powerful position the Masters holds in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   According to Augusta National policy, contracts with sponsors and
broadcast partners are reviewed yearly.</TE>
<TE>   There are no long-term or multiyear business arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National's relationship with its sponsors is also unique.
The usual business method is for a golf tournament to sell the rights
to televise its event to a broadcaster, which in turn sells
advertising time to sponsors and keeps the money.</TE>
<TE>   However, for the Masters, Augusta National enlists sponsors on its
own to control the commercial image of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The NCWO's Burk, who was at a conference in Maine on Friday and
not available for comment, was shocked at Johnson's public rebuke in
June. She wryly thanked Johnson for some of his comments about what
course of action he expected to see taken by the women's group.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson listed pressure on corporate sponsors and a boycott of
products as possible tactics.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Burk thanked Johnson for providing "a very nice
blueprint."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's action prompted speculation that CBS, the USA Network and
the Professional Golfers Assn. would encounter criticism for their
association with Augusta National. Neither Brendle, the CBS
spokeswoman, nor the PGA were prepared to address that issue directly
Friday. USA Network officials could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Combs, senior vice president of public relations and
communications at the PGA Tour, said the issue of female members at
Augusta National is not something that the tour should be debating.</TE>
<TE>   It is PGA Tour policy that the host organizations of co-sponsored
events, that is, events with which the tour has contracts, must stage
that tournament on a golf course with nondiscriminatory policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a contractual obligation with the Masters," Combs
said. "They set their agenda and that's it. We're really one step
removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Having said that, the Masters is fundamentally a part of
professional golf and has been since the 1930s. We recognize that and
respect it."</TE>
<TE>   The Masters is the first of the four "major" golf tournaments
played each year. The others are the United States Open championship,
the British Open and the PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National was formed as a private club in 1932 by golf
legend Bobby Jones. The first black professional to play the Masters
was Lee Elder in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The club, which is steadfast in protecting its secrecy, permits
women to play the course as guests.</TE>
<TE>   "As I previously said, there may come a day when women will be
invited to join our club, but that decision must be ours," Johnson
said in his statement Friday. "We also believe that the Masters and
the club are different, and that one should not affect the other."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Terror Video Termed Hoax; Tipster in Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The videotape obtained by the FBI was chilling: A man calling himself
an Islamic terrorist armed with a shoe bomb, gas canisters and a gun
claimed he and four others were planning a Sept. 11 attack on
Disneyland against "our enemies."</LD>
<LD>   Authorities acted swiftly. Dozens of law officers, including FBI
counterterrorism agents, raided the man's Santa Ana mobile home
Thursday. More than 100 stunned neighbors were evacuated. The suspect
was arrested.</LD>
<LD>   But no weapons or explosives were found.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Liyanase Tony Fernando was released from jail, and the
informant who provided the tape to officials was behind bars for
allegedly setting up authorities for an elaborate hoax.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say Jose Roberto Dominguez II, 22, of Anaheim
staged the videotaping in a Santa Ana hotel room. They say he first
fashioned an "explosive vest" by spray-painting cans black, gluing
lamp cords to them and putting them on the garment. He also put
flammable powder inside the drilled-out sole of a shoe. The gun was
plastic, apparently purchased at a swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez told authorities that he believed that Fernando, whom he
said he recently met at a Garden Grove Islamic center and knew as
"Imran," was capable of carrying out a suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "But Dominguez was overzealous in his efforts to show this,"
according to the federal complaint alleging that he made a false
report.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez's attorney said in court Friday that her client was a
freelance journalist who stumbled upon what he thought was a story.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez was ordered held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   The "terrorist" featured in the videotape, authorities say, was in
fact Fernando. What is baffling is why he dressed up for Dominguez's
camera and made the statements.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no clue," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Kevin Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Reached Friday at home, Fernando declined to comment. Federal
officials "told me not to speak to anyone or say anything," he said,
adding that he "didn't know anything" about the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Dominguez on Wednesday gave the
videotape to a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, who turned it
over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Fernando is seen brandishing the "weapons," and
Dominguez enters the scene to light the shoe powder.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez allegedly confessed to concocting the tape and the story
behind it, and he apologized, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the mobile home park Friday, neighbors said they were shocked
at Fernando's arrest.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana to Scrap Leaked Police Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Police Department has scrapped the results of an exam
taken by 107 officers seeking to become corporals after officials
learned that some got an early look at the questions.</LD>
<LD>   The city attorney's office is investigating because the test was
administered by Santa Ana's personnel department. Officials said they
are not sure how the questions leaked or who was responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Carona, a police department spokesman, said that when the
city finishes its probe, the case will be turned over to the
department's internal affairs division. Officers found to have
cheated on the exam could be fired, demoted or reprimanded.</LD>
<TE>   Candidates were notified that the test results were being tossed
out by an e-mail sent Aug. 8 by Mike Ernandes, a personnel office
supervisor. He said some officers received test questions in the
study materials they were sent.</TE>
<TE>   The written test was given July 24 and included questions about
police procedure. Those who passed would have been eligible to become
a corporal, a rank between officer and sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   The exam was the first conducted since 1998, said Sgt. Baltazar De
La Riva, police spokesman. A new exam will now be scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Police and city officials would not comment on how they learned
that the questions were leaked.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran Santa Ana officer, speaking anonymously, said about 30
officers received questions in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The officer, who didn't take the test, said the controversy has
created animosity on the part of exam takers who did not get
questions beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't do anything wrong and they were looking forward to
the opportunity to be promoted," the officer said.</TE>

<HD>Popular Two-Bit Cookie Requires a Bit More Dough</HD>
<DH>Retail: After 15 years, Diddy Riese shop near UCLA raises
price 40%-- or 10 cents. The owners are sorry but customers don't
seem to mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 40% price increase will take effect Sunday in one of the busiest
shops in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   But that's the way the cookie crumbles, say customers of Diddy
Riese, which is raising its prices for the first time in 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh-baked 25-cent cookies will cost 35-cent after today at the
neon-framed storefront at 926 Broxton Ave., half a block south of the
UCLA campus.</LD>
<TE>   "Inflation's terrible, isn't it?" said a financial planner, Steve
Jakowchik, laughing as he stocked up on chocolate chip, peanut butter
and cinnamon cookies while the price was still right.</TE>
<TE>   A sign posted in the shop window apologized for the price
hike--the store's first ever.</TE>
<TE>   "After 15 years, we at Diddy Riese must say goodbye to our old and
trusted friend, the 25-cent cookie," it read. "The present-day costs
of business demand that we adjust our price in order to remain a
healthy enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   Beneath it, a UCLA clinical psychologist, Bill Steh of Palms,
marveled at both the length of the line and the length of time the
cheap cookie had lasted.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's trying to get one last quarter's worth," he said,
laughing, a half-dollar in hand for one chocolate chip and one peanut
cookie. "But the amazing thing is, they've held out this long at this
price."</TE>
<TE>   That may be the sweetest part about even Diddy Riese's sugar
cookies. Around the corner, a rival cookie shop, Mrs. Fields, was
selling cookies for $1.19 each.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Diddy Riese owner Mark Perry said he had agonized for
months before boosting the price.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what kind of reaction you'll get. Anytime you
change anything, I don't think you can be overconfident," said Perry,
of West Los Angeles. "But in the last year and a half it was clear
that inflation was catching up with us and we had to make a move."</TE>
<TE>   The cookie store is named after Perry's grandmother. His parents
opened it after running a chain of smorgasbord restaurants called
Perry Boys in the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The shop is a popular stop for UCLA students. For years incoming
freshmen have been told of the Diddy Riese store during first-week
orientation. And, in the past, its cookies were sold in campus stores
for about 67 cents each, according to former students.</TE>
<TE>   "You come by here at midnight on a weekend and people are lined up
out the door for cookies," said one 19-year-old student, Youni Kim of
Westwood. "Their quarter price is surprising. So I think another 10
cents is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Christie Ciraulo, a technical writer from Westwood who said she
has turned over quarters "a thousand times" at the store, agreed as
she treated 8-year-old daughter Diana and two friends to cookies.
"It's still going to be the best deal in town."</TE>
<TE>   There is still plenty of competition, with more than 100 eateries
in the Westwood area and restaurant operators resorting to papering
the village's streets with sample menus and advertising fliers.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that, even with a 40% price hike, at Diddy Riese, they
may not be rolling in the dough.</TE>

<HD>10 Possible Routes Identified for Valley Public Transit
Corridor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has identified 10 potential
routes for a north-south public transit corridor in the San Fernando
Valley, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed paths, which could include dedicated bus lanes, range
from Topanga Canyon Boulevard in the west to Vineland Avenue in the
east. One possible plan would run buses down the San Diego Freeway.
Other possibilities include Canoga and Woodley avenues, San Fernando
Road, and Reseda, Sepulveda, Van Nuys and Lankershim boulevards.
Several of the routes would connect Metrolink or subway stations.</LD>
<LD>   The transit agency's other options include increasing regular bus
service on existing routes, adding more Metro Rapid bus lines, or
doing nothing.</LD>
<TE>   One of the agency's goals is to provide quicker connections from
Ventura Boulevard's Metro Rapid bus line to the future east-west
busway, which will use a defunct rail corridor on Chandler and
Victory boulevards to provide transit between Warner Center in
Woodland Hills and the North Hollywood Red Line subway station, said
Rick Jager, an MTA spokesman. The 14-mile busway is scheduled to open
in spring 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals for the north-south corridor were generated by a
$1-million, one-year study that began in May. The proposals are in
their early stages and the study has not yet identified costs, Jager
said.</TE>
<TE>   MTA staff and consultants plan to present the top one or two
options to the agency's board early next year. About $100 million in
state funding has been secured for the project. Already, bus-rider
advocates are expressing concerns about the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed routes ignore most of Sylmar, said Bart Reed,
executive director of the Transit Coalition, a rider advocacy group
based in that community. "I'm extremely perturbed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The transit agency plans to hold several public hearings on the
potential routes.</TE>
<TE>   Meetings are scheduled Sept. 9 in the ground-floor auditorium of
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 18300 Roscoe Blvd.; Sept. 10 in
the main gym of the North Hollywood Recreation Center, 11430 Chandler
Blvd.; and Sept. 12 in the main gym of the city of San Fernando
Recreation Park, 208 Park Ave. Each meeting is expected to run from 5
p.m. to 8 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Man, 28, Killed in Oxnard Shooting</HD>
<DH>Crime: A teen is also injured in a separate incident.
Police believe spree of recent violence may be gang-related.</DH>

<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One man was killed and a teenager seriously injured in separate
shootings in Oxnard on Thursday night, the latest in a series of
apparent gang-related attacks that have struck the city in less than
a week.</LD>
<LD>   Since Aug. 24, three men and one juvenile boy have been shot at
separate locations throughout the city, and detectives were working
Friday to determine whether the cases could be related.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said all four shootings appear to have been
gang-related.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent incident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. Thursday
at an apartment complex in the 5200 block of South J Street, on the
city's far south end.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, they found Emilio Fernandez, 28, in an
alley.</TE>
<TE>   He had been shot several times in the chest and died at the scene,
Sgt. Jason Benites said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities released few additional details except to say
Fernandez is survived by a girlfriend and their two children.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours earlier and six blocks from where Fernandez died,
officers found a gunshot victim in the 700 block of Cuesta Del Mar
Drive, Benites said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, a 17-year-old Oxnard boy, was inside a car that had
been stopped by officers who were acting on a tip that the vehicle
had been used in a shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager had been shot in the head, chest and leg, and was
listed in serious but stable condition Friday night at St. John's
Regional Medical Center, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same hospital, an 18-year-old Oxnard man also was in
serious but stable condition Friday after being shot in the head
about 1 a.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made in that case.</TE>
<TE>   According to Det. Terry Burr, the teenager, whom authorities would
not identify, was shot after leaving a group of friends in the 1500
block of East 2nd Street. The area is several miles north of the
Thursday night shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite a few people were out there with him but no one said they
saw anything," Burr said.</TE>
<TE>   And shortly after 8 a.m. Aug. 24, a 26-year-old Oxnard man was
shot several times in the Lemonwood Park area of eastern Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, also not identified, was taken by a resident to St.
John's Regional Medical Center, where he was treated and later
released.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives with the department's Violent Crimes Task Force are
assisting with the investigations, which authorities said are made
more difficult because victims and witnesses were not fully
cooperating.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the city dealt with a major gang flare-up was in
November 2000, when seven shootings occurred over 10 days. Five of
those cases occurred within a square-mile area near Wooley Road and
Channel Islands Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it is not known whether this week's shootings
indicate a reemergence of a gang flare-up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not hearing any additional rumblings on the streets [about
gang warfare] so this is kind of a mystery to us," Oxnard Police
Cmdr. Bryan MacDonald said.</TE>

<HD>Despair of Fruitless Rescue Effort Lingers</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: Doctor's first mission with L.A. squad was to
collapsed World Trade Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Greg Palmer had spent more than seven years training in urban
search and rescue operations so that he would be ready to rush into a
collapsed structure and rescue survivors.</LD>
<LD>   As a member of one of eight California urban search and rescue
teams formed after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Palmer kept a
duffel bag packed with survival gear ready even though he had never
been activated--until Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   On that day, as the nation absorbed the shock of terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Palmer left for New York
City for an 11-day deployment.</LD>
<TE>   "It came as a surprise that the time we were called up, after
seven years, turned out to be such a large-scale incident," Palmer
said, sitting in his office at Northridge Hospital and Medical
Center's Sherman Way Campus in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   As medical manager of the Los Angeles Fire Department's 56-member
urban search and rescue team, Palmer was in New York to supervise two
physicians and help other team members looking for survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Only now, nearly one year after two hijacked jetliners slammed
into the World Trade Center towers, has Palmer begun to come to grips
with his anger, sense of loss and renewed appreciation for
life--feelings he had to push aside as he combed through tons of
debris in the days immediately following the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so focused on the assignment at the time," Palmer said. "I
wasn't able to focus on the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he is still saddened by the loss of innocent life and
by the fact that his team did not find any survivors in the rubble of
the collapsed skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   Team members pulled six bodies from the twisted steel and concrete
in their first two days of searching, Palmer said, but their hopes
faded as time went on.</TE>
<TE>   "To know that there were so many people missing; to see the
displays put up on fences by families looking for their loved ones,
and not to have found one person alive was very disheartening," he
said. "Emergency rooms were ready for a deluge of people that never
came."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Mike Jacalone, who heads the 56-member Los Angeles City Fire
Department urban search and rescue team of which Palmer is a member,
said many rescue workers still are troubled that no one was found
alive.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a successful deployment," said Jacalone, "but it's hard to
call it successful when there were no survivors to recover. It weighs
heavy on our hearts and minds."</TE>
<TE>   Powerful memories of standing among the devastation at ground zero
on the night following the attack still surface in Palmer's thoughts.
"I was overwhelmed by the size of the site. It seemed almost surreal
because of all the floodlights."</TE>
<TE>   As an emergency room physician, Palmer has seen his share of
disfiguring injuries, but he was not prepared for what he saw at the
towers' collapse site.</TE>
<TE>   "There was only rubble and powder," he said. "There was only
minimal evidence of humans in that rubble. No one could have realized
that the force of the fire and collapse would have pulverized
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's initial feelings of shock and grief have given way to
simmering anger.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten more angry about the attack on us," he said. "I feel
especially bad because of the innocence of the people who were total
noncombatants."</TE>
<TE>   The humble Arcadia physician with a gracious manner and a dry
sense of humor, however, has not allowed himself to become bitter in
the last year. Instead, he said he has come to value life and his
family even more.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't appreciate what we have until something horrific like
this happens," he said. "There isn't a day that I leave for work
anymore that I don't kiss my wife goodbye and tell her that I love
her."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he doesn't have any special plans to mark the
anniversary. Instead, he intends to spend a quiet day with his wife,
Suzanne.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that anniversaries are significant to terrorist groups,"
Palmer said, referring to the Oklahoma bombing that occurred on the
second anniversary of the fire at the Branch Davidian compound near
Waco, Texas. "I hope it will be a very quiet Sept. 11 for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Although Palmer's unit has not been called up since the attack,
the physician continues to train in urban search and rescue
operations and confined space medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "Palmer is very committed to the team," Jacalone said. "He makes
himself available for nearly every training."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer hopes that he will never have to put his training to use
again, but he is prepared to go if called upon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget how privileged I was to go and participate in
something that was so historic and so monumental to the country," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Crowd Answers Call of the Campgrounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gerri Sakata understands why people flock to the Lake Casitas
Recreation Area campgrounds. Though she is decidedly not an outdoorsy
person, she fell in love with the sparkling turquoise lake after her
husband convinced her to try camping there 13 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Sakatas, both recent retirees from Redondo Beach, have camped
at this spot frequently over the years and have seen their share of
busy holiday weekends--but nothing that compares with the crowd that
is expected to fill the park to capacity this Labor Day.</LD>
<LD>   Sakata, 61, said she doesn't mind sharing the lake with fellow
campers, "but I'll be looking forward to Monday, when everybody else
pulls out," she said, smiling.</LD>
<TE>   The Sakatas are among an estimated 4.63 million Southern
Californians expected to travel during the Labor Day weekend,
according to the Automobile Club of Southern California. That number
is down slightly from last year's figure.</TE>
<TE>   Campgrounds are among the most popular Labor Day destinations in
Ventura County. Cars and trucks were already lining up early Friday
afternoon to enter the campgrounds at Lake Casitas. Park rangers said
all of the camp's more than 400 spots had been reserved for the
weekend. And in Los Padres National Forest, a ban on open campfires
and charcoal barbecues hasn't deterred campers from clamoring for
campsites in Ojai and near Santa Barbara, said forest spokeswoman
Juanita Freel.</TE>
<TE>   Other popular getaway destinations for Southern Californians this
year are the central California coast, San Diego, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and the Grand Canyon, said Carol Thorp of the auto club.
People across the nation seem to be sticking close to home this year,
possibly as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks, Thorp said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, the usual spots maintained their popularity,
but there was more of an emphasis on what we call 'discover America'
trips this year," she said. "Overall ... the most popular vacations
were closer to home."</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices are expected to rise slightly, which is common on
holiday weekends. Thorp said regional prices would likely rise about
2 cents per gallon from last week, to an average of $1.62 in the Los
Angeles area and $1.71 in Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many holiday weekend travelers plan to drive, and the
increased traffic may cause some bottlenecks along Ventura County
thoroughfares.</TE>
<TE>   "Plan on some pretty substantial delays," said Steve Reid, a
spokesman for the California Highway Patrol office in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP typically boosts its patrols during holiday weekends, and
last year arrested 24 drunk drivers throughout the Labor Day weekend.
This year, the agency plans to have 80% of available officers on
patrol in an effort to curb drunk driving and watch for seat belt
violations, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Vacationers in Ventura County can look forward to sunny and warm
weather this weekend, said Stuart Seto of the National Weather
Service bureau in Oxnard. The weekend forecast calls for low clouds
and fog this morning, then mostly sunny weather through Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   That is great news for Sakata, who plans to go fishing with her
husband, John, soak up some sun and generally enjoy the second month
of her retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "It can get pretty crowded [at the campground], with people
everywhere," she said. "But just getting away from the city is very
relaxing."</TE>

<HD>Hot to Get Hotter on Sunday, Labor Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forecasters say the weather will get dramatically hotter this Labor
Day weekend, with high temperatures of 105 or more in the San
Fernando and San Gabriel valleys on Sunday and Monday.</LD>
<LD>   During the last couple of weeks, temperatures remained at or below
normal in the Los Angeles Basin, thanks largely to a persistent
onshore flow of cool, moist air from the Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   But the National Weather Service says that onshore flow should end
this morning, with coastal clouds clearing away by noon. Beachfront
thermometer readings in the 70s are expected by midafternoon, with
top readings of close to 100 in the valleys.</LD>
<TE>   Temperatures about 5 degrees higher than Saturday's are expected
on Sunday and Labor Day, with only slight cooling Tuesday. But
forecasters said a return of the onshore flow could drop temperatures
below normal again toward the end of next week.</TE>

<HD>Surf City Will Keep Museum Rent-Free</HD>
<DH>Council: To help budget shortfall, Huntington Beach
considered asking institution to pay for its downtown space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Surfing Museum, a Huntington Beach institution that
celebrates the sport and its devotees, has survived an attempt by the
city to charge it rent, a move that would have forced it to close,
museum officials said this week. City Councilman Ralph H. Bauer had
proposed that the museum pay at least half of the average rent for
retail space in the downtown area.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal was part of a package of recommendations Bauer urged
the council to consider as a way to help provide funding for the
Shipley Nature Center and the Police Department's DARE anti-drug
program and crime lab, all of which are threatened by the city's
budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   But the council rejected the proposal at its meeting this week.</LD>
<TE>   "The question becomes is it more important to subsidize the surf
museum or have a crime lab," Bauer said. "I don't say it's [the
museum] not important, I'm just saying the city shouldn't be carrying
the whole burden."</TE>
<TE>   The museum, housed in a 2,000-square-foot structure on Olive
Street, makes a token payment of $1 a year to the city, which owns
the building. Rent for retail space downtown averages about $3 a
month per square foot. At those rates, the museum would have to pay
the city about $3,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be able to exist without the city giving us that
space for a $1 a year," museum board chairman Bob Frederickson said.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, which attracts about 10,000 visitors a year, depends
on corporate and institutional donations, proceeds from its gift shop
and the donations from visitors.</TE>
<TE>   But that money "pretty much goes to the operation of the museum,"
Frederickson said.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Kotsch, who founded the museum more than 20 years ago,
said there are plans for a new surfing museum as part of the Pacific
City development, to be built on 31 acres between 1st Street and the
Hyatt Regency. "We eventually will move," she said, "but it's not in
the near future."</TE>
<TE>   The Olive Street building is on a list of city-owned properties
that could eventually be put up for sale, Bauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is concluding its sponsorship of a monthlong
celebration of surfing, including the dedication of a postage stamp
honoring surfing legend Duke Paoa Kahanamoku.</TE>

<LD>Brea police, who patrol Yorba Linda under contract, are holding a
Riverside County man they believe may have exposed himself to two
women and tried to grab one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Kyle Salassa, 29, of Murrieta was arrested earlier this week
on suspicion of committing a lewd act in public after police found
him disrobing under an overpass at Esperanza Road and Yorba Linda
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   It is the same place where women saw a man exposing himself on
Aug. 6 and Aug. 20. In one incident, he tried to grab a woman and
drag her into the bushes. Detectives were watching the area because
of the incidents when they saw and arrested Salassa.</LD>

<HD>The Idea of Being Top Banana Museum Apparently Is Not That
Appealing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've written about Ken Bannister's unsuccessful effort to find a
buyer for his Altadena-based Banana Museum, all 17,000 collectibles
of it. And for just $300,000.</LD>
<LD>   I don't understand; there's got to be someone out there who would
treasure such mementos as a banana-sequined purse bearing the image
of Michael Jackson. I was depressed about this impasse until I was
tipped by reader Bob Patterson, a columnist for the online
publication Delusions of Adequacy, about another banana museum. This
one's in Auburn, Wash., where Ann Mitchell Lovell has 4,000 items.</LD>
<LD>   I phoned Lovell and asked if she'd buy Bannister's Banana Museum
for $300,000. Lovell burst out in laughter.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a state employee," she said. "I don't have any money."</TE>
<TE>   Banana split (cont.): Lovell, who keeps most of her artifacts, art
items and cultural curiosities in a bedroom, says of Bannister, "I'm
not trying to compete with him. He has the world's largest banana
museum."</TE>
<TE>   But she does have one collectible that her Altadena rival lacks: a
4-foot-tall bass shaped like a Chiquita banana (see photo). (She
bought the musical instrument from an antique store and has been
unable to determine its origin--movie prop, etc.) Lovell says that
her love of the fruit began as a child when her parents called her
Anna Banana. Her collecting moved into overdrive when, on a trip to
Hawaii, she bought a T-shirt advertising a bar called Anna's Bannanas
(misspelled, but who cares?).</TE>
<TE>   Her collection is therapeutic.</TE>
<TE>   "In California you have so much sunshine," she said. "Up here, it
so gray and so rainy. That's why I love having all this yellow in my
house. It brightens my mood."</TE>
<TE>   Love fades but business must go on: "You've heard of fire sales,
flood sales and going-out-of-business sales,'' said Mimi Kalland of
San Pedro. But in Edinburgh, Scotland, she came upon a new variety
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Mark McClain of Glendora found a place where you
better be careful if you back up in the buffet line (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Familiar waters: Dana Rohrabacher, known as "the surfing
congressman," donned a wetsuit and swam with some sharks for 45
minutes at Long Beach's Aquarium of the Pacific on Friday. The Orange
County Republican told KFWB radio that he felt "safer here" than in
Washington, where the sharks "seem hungrier." One word of advice,
congressman: Let's not get carried away and request a personal
appearance with a komodo dragon at the L.A. Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The other day this column showed a White House press
pass that said President Bush was visiting Santa "Anna."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Robb of L.A. said he was surprised that a president from
Texas would want such a confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time," Robb pointed out, "Gen. Santa Anna defeated the
Texans at the Alamo."</TE>

<HD>A Bit of Italy Finds a Lasting Home on Bay</HD>
<DH>Long Beach gondola rides are a rite of passage for young
oarsmen, font of memories for public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a giant genie's slipper, the black gondola glides across
tranquil Alamitos Bay, one gondolier pushing one oar. As the sun
drops toward the horizon, his two passengers bundle up in a plaid
wool blanket and clink champagne flutes.</LD>
<LD>   They are bound for the wind-sheltered waterways of Naples Island,
where million-dollar homes and docked yachts line the canals. The
gondolier croons in the best serenissima tradition.</LD>
<LD>   "O sooole miiiiiiio .... "</LD>
<TE>   Since the Venetian boats were launched off Long Beach 20 years
ago, 400 young men and women have donned the gondolier's straw hat,
black pants and striped T-shirt. Reporting for work, they have
stepped off the wharf at Alamitos Bay, then spent eight-hour shifts
taking passengers through the canals across the bay from Belmont
Shore.</TE>
<TE>   A rite of passage for many a Long Beach teenager, the gondolier
experience is a sort of outdoor finishing school.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a gondolier involves, not just the responsibility for
people's safety, it requires social skill, aplomb and a sense of
humor," said Jonathan Talberg, a gondolier from 1991 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Now 33, Talberg is director of choral, vocal and opera studies at
Cal State Long Beach. He has steered several singing students toward
Gondola Getaway's funky shack for what he calls "the great college
job."</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the fleet of 10 custom-built black gondolas--the largest of
which seats 14--the gondoliers ply the waters surrounding what are
actually the three islands of Naples.</TE>
<TE>   As guide and host, the gondolier must learn to read the mood of
his guests. Otherwise, he risks killing a magic moment with, say, a
monologue on the art of Venetian rowing.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, passengers go for hourlong rides, which cost $65 for
two people and more for groups.</TE>
<TE>   Sunset cruises are in greatest demand, but the gondolas are out in
broad daylight, dodging swimmers and windsurfers, and are often busy
well into the night. Depending on passenger preference, the gondolas
may stick to the canals, or head out into the middle of the bay,
where the twinkling shore lights are more distant.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be gondoliers must have mastered a few authentic-sounding
Italian songs to serenade passengers under the canal bridges (good
acoustics).</TE>
<TE>   They need to swim well (just in case), understand currents and
have the stamina to power the long wooden oar for several hours at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   One gondolier put out a house fire several years ago, Talberg
said. He himself was awarded a commendation by the Long Beach Fire
Department for saving a 3-year-old boy who had fallen into the water
beside the gondola wharf.</TE>
<TE>   Current gondoliers include college students studying opera and
schoolteachers. One is a poet and leader of a band called John Wilkes
Kissing Booth.</TE>
<TE>   The original gondolier, Michael O'Toole, dreamed up the "business"
for a school project in his last class as a USC marketing major. A
slightly looser ship was run in the early days, O'Toole recalled. Row
around the buoy and back and you'd be a gondolier.</TE>
<TE>   The first "gondola" was a Pakistani fishing boat powered by a
battery-driven motor bolted to the stern. There were no uniforms, no
jaunty hats, no "O Sole Mio" under the arches.</TE>
<TE>   Two years into the work and it dawned on O'Toole: The gondola
business needed an actual gondola.</TE>
<TE>   He and business partner David Black traveled to Venice to
investigate the possibilities. Watching gondoliers threading through
the city's waterways, O'Toole gained a passion for the unusual boat
and its rich history dating to the 11th century.</TE>
<TE>   Back home the partners commissioned a Seal Beach ship maker to
build a gondola. From the research mission to Italy, O'Toole also
learned about the Venetian style of rowing, which would later be
passed on to two decades of gondoliers--not just the 400 in Long
Beach, but crews at hotels such as the Hyatt in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
which offers gondola rides around a lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this summer, O'Toole rowed one of the gondolas into
Alamitos Bay as he and two veteran gondoliers expounded on the fine
points of the watercraft. They demonstrated how the unusually long
oar provides more maneuverability in navigating narrow channels, and
how the gondola's oar works within its specialized walnut oar lock,
called the forcola.</TE>
<TE>   "Only three men in Venice make the forcola," said Bob Johnson, 31.
A refugee of the dot-com collapse, the job-hunting Web designer had
returned to gondola rowing, which in 1985 was his first job.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, we were all local boys," said Johnson,
pointing toward the peninsula where he grew up. "It was the cool high
school boy job. Like being a waiter at the Chart House."</TE>
<TE>   It remains so today, Talberg said. As with a waiter, the hourly
base pay is minimum wage ($6.75), but tips can reach $140 during a
good eight-hour shift.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, couples get married aboard the biggest gondola. Every
week couples become engaged. Once in a while, a floating bridal
shower will get a little wild, and the women will strip.</TE>
<TE>   When such revelry occurs, it's the job of the gondolier to row
discreetly away from the lighted patios and picture windows of
residential Long Beach into darker, more private waters.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not against the law or unreasonable," Talberg said, the
gondolier "tries to swing with it."</TE>
<TE>   Each year, O'Toole selects a team from among the strongest and
most experienced gondoliers to travel to Venice and compete in a
regatta.</TE>
<TE>   Called the Vogalonga, or long row, it is a 30-kilometer race in
which 5,000 contestants on about 1,000 boats squeeze through the
canals and lagoons of Venice. A 1985 Long Beach team placed first.</TE>
<TE>   "For one day," O'Toole said, "the motorboats are turned off, and
the butcher, the barber, the shopkeeper and everyday person
celebrates the gondola."</TE>
<TE>   In May, American flag waving off the back of the gondola and
locals cheering, the Long Beach crew was the first-place American
team.</TE>
<TE>   "We were also the only American entry," O'Toole said.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Rape Victim Admits Story Is False</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who touched off a massive search by telling police she was
raped in Griffith Park admitted she fabricated the story, authorities
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police said the woman told them Monday that she had
been carjacked in Murrieta by a man with silver teeth and tattoos,
who drove her 100 miles to Griffith Park and raped her repeatedly.</LD>
<LD>   Police dispatched a helicopter, bloodhounds, officers on horseback
and bicycles, and a SWAT unit to Griffith Park for a search that
continued more than 24 hours.</LD>
<TE>   But after police caught inconsistencies in her story, she admitted
Thursday that she drove to the park by herself to meet someone with
whom she had corresponded on the Internet, and made up the rape story
to account for the time she spent away from home, Murrieta police
said. She admitted planning the false report and buying duct tape on
her way to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta police would not release the woman's name. They will
recommend that the district attorney's office charge her with filing
a false police report.</TE>

<HD>Judge Urged to Pull Ballot Measure</HD>
<DH>Housing: SOAR seeks to block Ventura hills project. But
backers say let voters decide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arguing that the measure violates state law, slow-growth advocates
urged a judge Friday to strike down an initiative that seeks voter
approval to build 1,390 homes on the hillsides overlooking Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the proposed housing project, who filed a lawsuit
last month challenging the constitutionality of Measure A, want it
pulled from the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   But backers of the Open 80 Master Plan Act, which was placed on
the ballot after a successful petition drive sponsored by the
landowners, contend the initiative is legally sound and should go
before the voters this fall.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe very strongly that the people should have a right to
decide," said attorney Joel A. Feuer, whose Los Angeles firm
represents the landowners.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, homes concentrated in six clustered areas would be
built on undeveloped grazing land north of Foothill Road over the
next 20 years. More than 3,000 acres--about 80% of the land--would be
preserved as open space. The plan also calls for two new city parks
and 25 miles of public trails.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers squared off on the measure Friday during an hourlong
hearing before Ventura County Superior Court Judge Henry J. Walsh and
a courtroom crowded with activists and community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh warned the attorneys to restrict their arguments to the
relevant legal issues. "I'm not interested in hearing arguments on
whether the hiking trails are good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the petitioners, representing SOAR Inc., Walsh remarked
that the legal standard for a pre-election challenge is high, and
noted that similar requests have been reviewed--and denied--by him in
the past. But SOAR attorney James M. Wagstaffe said the issues in
this case are different.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, backed by the landowners, violates a section of
the California Constitution that prohibits citizen-sponsored ballot
measures from benefiting any private corporation, Wagstaffe argued.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose was to prevent private profiteering," the San
Francisco attorney said. "It is a clear violation of [state law]."</TE>
<TE>   But Feuer argued that local rules trump state law in cities, such
as Ventura, where voters have passed laws making themselves
responsible for land-use decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In the past decade, residents in almost every city in Ventura
County have approved strict growth-control laws aimed at curbing
urban expansion onto farmland and open space. The laws require voter
approval of projects outside urban boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura voters in 1995 were the first to adopt such guidelines.
Last year, residents passed Measure P, putting restrictions on
extending city services such as water and sewer into the
unincorporated hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Open 80 argue that nowhere in the city charter does
it state that local rules will supersede state rules on such issues.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not an easy decision to make," Wagstaffe told Walsh of
SOAR's request to pull the measure from the ballot. "But it is
compelled by the California Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh took the matter under submission and is expected to rule
next week.</TE>

<HD>Tiger's School Could Land at Anaheim Course</HD>
<DH>Golf: Dad Miller facility is in the running to host Woods'
permanent clinic for needy youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tiger Woods Foundation plans to build an educational center where
children would take computer classes, be tutored and learn the finer
points of golf next to a course somewhere in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The $25-million center would be privately funded and is designed
to expose children from less-privileged backgrounds to a game often
associated with wealth and exclusivity.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to introduce the game of golf to kids who otherwise
wouldn't have an opportunity to play," said Greg McLaughlin,
executive director for the Los Alamitos-based foundation. "We hope
this would enhance a community and help a lot of kids."</LD>
<TE>   Among locations in the running for the Tiger Woods Learning Center
are the H.G. Dad Miller Golf Course in Anaheim and an unidentified
site in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of leasing the Dad Miller driving range to Woods'
foundation was raised by Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the Orange
County Board of Supervisors. The county flood control district owns
the driving range and a portion of the 18-hole course. The current
lease between the county and city expires Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Building the center in Anaheim would be fitting for Woods, who
attended Western High School in Anaheim and frequently played the Dad
Miller course in the mid-1990s. In the years since, he has become a
sports phenomenon, considered among the greatest athletes in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The center would be the foundation's first permanent location.
Woods, who lives in Orlando, Fla., has for years held traveling
clinics for inner-city kids--25 clinics in 25 cities as of this year.</TE>
<TE>   No deal has been struck with Anaheim, but negotiations are
continuing, said Tom Coad, Cynthia Coad's husband and advisor. "She's
given it her full support and cooperation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city's
staff also has been talking to the foundation about possible sites
and "we're very excited about the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Councilman Tom Tait said he wants Anaheim to land the
center.</TE>
<TE>   "To bring Tiger Woods' name and on top of that, the $25-million
[investment] would just be wonderful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very optimistic," added Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim),
a graduate of Anaheim High School. "I love to see stories of a local
boy who does well and comes back and invests in his community for the
next generation."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for a two-story, 30,000 square-foot learning center
next to a driving range and putting area. The first floor would house
a pro shop, administrative offices and classrooms. The second floor
would have computer classes with up to 200 terminals, a library and
space for tutoring in reading and writing.</TE>
<TE>   The center would be for children ages 8 to 17. Renowned golf
architect Tom Fazio would design its playing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   A sticking point has been finding an urban golf course with enough
land to accommodate the learning center without displacing golfers.</TE>
<TE>   Courses in other parts of the country have expressed interest
"where land is not an issue," McLaughlin said, but Woods wants the
center built close to home in Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Low-Income Tenants Get Eviction Reprieve</HD>
<DH>Housing: Owner of six buildings agrees to keep them in a
subsidized program, pending a September hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenants living in federally subsidized housing received a temporary
reprieve Friday when the owner of six buildings in Los Angeles agreed
to keep the units in the program until a court hearing can be held.</LD>
<LD>   Under an agreement reached in Los Angeles Superior Court, the six
buildings that make up L.A. Pro VI will remain in the Section 8
program until at least Sept. 27, when a judge will hear the case. The
buildings are in South Los Angeles, some near USC.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Reginald A. Dunn did not grant
the city's request for a temporary restraining order, but city
attorneys and officials said they were pleased with the agreement.</LD>
<TE>   For the moment, "they're not going to evict; there will be no
change in rents," said Cecilia Estolano, special assistant city
attorney. "We accomplished what we hoped to achieve through the
temporary restraining order."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Chaplan, an attorney representing HAP Partners V, which owns
four of the buildings, said worries that tenants would lose their
homes are misplaced.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants ... to get rid of low-income tenants," he said.
"They want them to stay. It's their intention to continue to offer
low-income housing."</TE>
<TE>   The contract with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, set to expire today, has been extended to Oct. 31,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Requests for injunctions involving owners of Sun Valley and Venice
apartments in the Section 8 program will be heard Tuesday, Estolano
said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Mayor James K. Hahn and Los Angeles City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo announced that the city was filing for temporary
restraining orders and injunctions against several apartment owners
who were attempting to remove their buildings from Section 8.</TE>
<TE>   City officials argue that the owners failed to abide by a state
law that requires extensive notification to tenants and several
public entities before removing buildings from the program.
Notification allows the city time to take measures to preserve the
units as affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has been a key concern for Hahn, who urged the legal
action, which also won unanimous support from the Los Angeles City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited that the owners came to the table, and we're going
to be able to work with them to protect the tenants," said Sarah
Dusseault, assistant deputy mayor for economic development, referring
to the L.A. Pro VI buildings. "The most important thing is that
owners need to know that they need to include the city in their
decisions to opt out of Section 8. We want the notice as required by
state law."</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office withdrew its request for a temporary
restraining order against the owners of Arminta North and South in
Sun Valley because tenants there have received enhanced Section 8
vouchers that will allow them to remain in their apartments, Estolano
said.</TE>
<TE>   The contract for the Venice building has been extended until
December. The city's request for injunctions, however, remains in
place.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still going to compel those owners to give us proper notice
under the law," Estolano said. "This is about preserving our
affordable-housing stock."</TE>

<LD>Sheriff's deputies have arrested seven suspects in the beating and
stabbing of a 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was attacked on Wilbur Road as he was walking home from a
friend's house about 1:30 a.m. Aug. 17, according to deputies.</LD>
<LD>   He was stabbed with a knife a dozen times by at least two
assailants and underwent surgery at Los Robles Regional Medical
Center. He was released last week.</LD>
<TE>   Four adults are each being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at the
East County Jail. They are Daniel Lemus, 19, Lauren Rodriguez, 18,
Allan Calero, 19, and Gerardo Ku, 18. Three other male suspects,
ranging in age from 14 to 17, are being held at Juvenile Hall pending
a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   All the suspects are from Thousand Oaks and were arrested
Thursday, according to the deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Lemus and two of the juveniles are documented members of a
Thousand Oaks gang, deputies said, adding that the four other
suspects are known to associate with the gang.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the victim is not associated with gangs and had
recently moved into the area.</TE>

<LD>A Pasadena man accused of kidnapping a woman from her east Ventura
home and sexually assaulting her pleaded not guilty to criminal
charges Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Fields, 27, was arrested earlier this month in a Pasadena
motel room after police received tips based on a composite drawing of
the suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Police launched a search after a man slipped though an unlocked
sliding glass door into the home of a 52-year-old woman on June 27
and ordered her into her car. The man sexually assaulted the woman in
Oxnard, then forced her to withdraw cash from an ATM before driving
her to the Hollywood area, where she escaped, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Fields is charged with burglary, kidnapping, two counts of rape,
robbery and carjacking. He remains jailed in lieu of $360,000 bail. A
preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 11.</TE>

<HD>Big Thank-You Is Delivered to Architect</HD>
<DH>Environment: Activists praise Frank Gehry for deciding not
to relocate his Santa Monica design studio to the Playa Vista
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists delivering a thank-you note Friday to architect
Frank Gehry for picking someplace other than Playa Vista for his new
design studio said they hope to make the "Spruce Goose" hangar a
cornerstone of a future nature center at the site.</LD>
<LD>   In urging Gehry to support the conversion of Howard Hughes' old
aircraft plant, activists said they want to preserve Hughes' historic
and huge Spruce Goose Hangar.</LD>
<LD>   "Being named for a bird, it could become a museum and a natural
cultural center," said Roy Van de Hoek, chairman of the Sierra Club
Ballona Wetlands Task Force, as he addressed activists gathered
outside of Gehry's Santa Monica office.</LD>
<TE>   The architect, whose work includes the Disney Hall in downtown Los
Angeles, has disclosed plans to move his headquarters several blocks
north of the sprawling Playa Vista site in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That's a switch from last year, when Gehry announced his intention
to relocate to Playa Vista itself. He has been hired by the
developer, Maguire Partners, to design new buildings there.</TE>
<TE>   His change in plans prompted Friday's rally by about a dozen
environmentalists who signed a poster-size thank-you card. Marcia
Hanscom, head of the Wetlands Action Network, said a coalition of
conservation groups plans to press state officials to purchase the
land eyed by Maguire Partners and turn it into permanent parkland.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that land contains old aircraft plant structures,
including the 742-foot long, 100-foot high hangar once used to store
Hughes' wood-sided Spruce Goose. The one-of-a-kind plane, designed as
a troop carrier, flew only once and was never put into production.</TE>
<TE>   "State parks is interested in historical properties," Van de Hoek
said. The Spruce Goose hangar could be preserved as a place to
rehabilitate or breed birds or mammals and for educational use--even
to demonstrate and display such things as mechanical birds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry, who was said to be inside his office meeting with clients,
did not show up to be thanked personally.</TE>
<TE>   But Peggy Moretti, a spokeswoman for Maguire Partners, said Gehry
is relocating away from the Playa Vista site only because he has run
out of space in Santa Monica and must move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Others at the rally said halting further development of Playa
Vista would make sense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the lungs of the city," one Marina del Rey resident, Polly
Perlman, said of the wetland. "The Spruce Goose hangar belongs there.
We'll make it belong in a park."</TE>

<HD>Jury Finds Man Guilty of Killing Student</HD>
<DH>Crime: Sonny Wong stabbed and strangled man, whose body was
found in burned car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury on Friday convicted a La Puente man of murdering a college
student whose body was found in the trunk of his burned-out car in
Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Yichen "Eric" Liu, 20, was found stabbed and strangled
inside his Honda off Laguna Canyon Road on Jan 24, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Sonny Joshua Wong, 25, faces life in prison without parole.</LD>
<TE>   The jury at the Central Justice Center in Santa Ana convicted Wong
of one count of first-degree murder with special circumstances of
murder during a robbery and lying in wait.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that Wong and his former girlfriend, Helen Mo,
killed Lui because he was about to turn Mo in for theft. Mo was
earlier convicted of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Mo had dated Liu for a brief time and feared he
would turn her in for stealing two bracelets, a necklace and credit
card. She had two previous burglary convictions and faced a
three-strikes sentence of 25 years to life if convicted again.</TE>
<TE>   After Liu discovered the theft, he went to Mo's home, authorities
said. He was beaten and stabbed by Mo's new boyfriend and two of his
friends, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Liu's body was stuffed in the trunk of his car, which was driven
to a remote area and set afire.</TE>

<HD>Craving That 9-Month Break</HD>
<DH>August is hard on parents and kids: Let school begin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN SCHOETTLER FOX</AU>
<BD>Robin Schoettler Fox is a Northern California writer
formerly of Manhattan Beach. Her e-mail address:
Contactrobinsfox@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The envelopes arrived in early August. Three big Manila envelopes
jammed with forms and start-of-the-new-school-year information
sheets. There was one envelope for each of our sons, all of whom are
enrolled in elementary school this fall.</LD>
<LD>   When I first spied the envelopes in the mailbox, I smiled the
smile of a sailor spotting a seagull at the end of a long voyage
across the ocean. It was a smile of hope; an end was in sight. Those
envelopes confirmed what I knew in my heart. "School has to start
soon," I had said to a friend days before. "It's time."</LD>
<LD>   Our sons needed structure back in their lives and I needed a
little quiet time in mine, I explained. Summer had gone on long
enough. The big family vacation was weeks ago. The swim meets, the
baseball tournaments and the junior tennis matches were over. Our
sons' organized activities had dwindled to nothing. The kids were
bored with the pool, bored with the dog and bored with me.</LD>
<TE>   We were starting to get on each other's nerves.</TE>
<TE>   We needed to take a break. A 15-minute timeout wouldn't do it. An
overnight camp was too much. The way I figured it, what we needed was
a few hours apart five days a week for, say, the next nine months. We
needed school.</TE>
<TE>   My sons, though, were still in vacation mode. As the calendar
cleared, they stepped up their campaign to be entertained. "Can we do
something tomorrow?" Jamie would ask at bedtime. "Are we going to do
anything today?" Danny would ask at breakfast. Even 6-year-old Scotty
chimed in. "Can I have a play date?" he would ask whenever he didn't
have one.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you take us to the skate park?" they asked. "Can we have a
sleepover? What about going to Water World today? Can we go here, do
that, then stop and get a Jamba?" Anything but hang around the house.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't get it; the calendar was clearing for a reason. Time
was running out, I told them. We had things to do. Important things.
Get-ready-for-school things. We had to clean bedrooms and organize
desks. We needed to sift clothes, count underwear and try on
sneakers. It was time to make a list, check it twice and head to
Target.</TE>
<TE>   Tick, tick, tick. Didn't they hear the school year's clock
ticking? If we didn't start out the new school year organized, how
would we ever catch up?</TE>
<TE>   Hearing all those "things to do" made the kids grumpy. Now I was
definitely getting on their nerves, big-time. I was Mother Grinch
trying to steal summer right from under their suntanned noses.</TE>
<TE>   All of that proved once again what I've observed for years: Summer
is hard on parents. We start out in June all smiles and plans, with
schedules penned on calendars. By August we're tired. In cities and
towns across the U.S., thousands of parents are at this very moment
counting little square boxes on those calendars--boxes that lead from
today to the first day of school.</TE>
<TE>   They're counting the number of days before they return to life as
they knew it before the end-of-the-school-year parties and final band
concerts last June.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the calendar and the big Manila envelope. School needs to
start now, I wrote in my journal one recent morning. If not today,
then tomorrow. Friday at the latest.</TE>
<TE>   As I wrote these words, I heard footsteps in the hall. Scotty
turned the corner and crept quietly toward my desk. Without a word,
he climbed into my lap and cuddled his head into the curve of my
neck. We sat there for a long time because we could. I held him until
he didn't want to be held anymore, because there was nowhere else he
had to be, nowhere else I had to be and nothing more important we had
to do. It was summertime, and the living was easy once more.</TE>

<HD>What's So Special About Special Education Class?</HD>
<DH>Everyone needs help with something.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER GOLDBERG</AU>
<BD>Jennifer Goldberg is currently a graduate student at
UCLA. She taught special education for five years in the Midwest.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Congress considers reauthorizing programs for students with
disabilities, I find myself contemplating third grade.</LD>
<LD>   I don't remember a lot from that year, but I do remember feeling
stupid because I was pulled out of class to go to a special reading
group.</LD>
<LD>   Why was I sent to this group? Because it took me a long time to
complete reading worksheets. The experience left me painfully aware
of being different.</LD>
<TE>   In the middle of third grade, my "reading problem" suddenly
disappeared. The reason was simple: My family moved.</TE>
<TE>   My new school placed less emphasis on worksheets. This better
suited my learning style, and I was placed in an advanced reading
group. In turn, I was excited about having the opportunity to learn
and felt a sense of relief as my categorization of being slow or
possibly learning-disabled was lifted.</TE>
<TE>   By sheer happenstance, I was taken out of a school that did not
work for me. Other children are not so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to education, one size does not fit all.</TE>
<TE>   We are stuck in a Catch-22. Given the structure of our educational
system, labels are necessary to provide vital services to students.
Labels provide funding to support teachers who are trained to teach
students with diverse needs and to provide speech and orthopedic
therapy, classroom aids, smaller class sizes and appropriate
textbooks and materials. But with this critical funding comes the
labeling and categorizing of students.</TE>
<TE>   Special education is not a response to pathology or inadequacy.
Instead, special education is the response of a complex educational
system to human variation. Students in both special education and
regular education classes have diverse needs that must be met by this
vast system.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there are kids with disabilities. But what does that mean?
Shaquille O'Neal is an outstanding basketball player and has been
named the most valuable player in the National Basketball Assn.
finals three times. Yet he has consistently needed special assistance
in making free throws. I don't think anyone would argue that he is
basketball-impaired because of this special assistance. Everyone
needs assistance in some context.</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher and student, I am outraged when I hear people make a
distinction between "normal" children and other children. While
teaching in a middle school, my heart sank when a student exclaimed
to my whole class, "I don't want to go with the stupid
kids"--referring to studying with students with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   One in every eight students in public school participates in
special education. With numbers like that, what does it mean to be
"special"? Who's different?</TE>

<HD>Conserve Now, Fish Later</HD>
<DH>Federal and state agencies should stand firm on ocean
reserves. In the long run the bans will work to the advantage of even
the fishermen who are howling now.</DH>

<LD>Fishermen trawling the edges of ocean areas where fishing is banned
or restricted--from Cape Canaveral to New England's Georges Bank and
marine reserves in South Africa and New Zealand--are rewarded with
more abundant catches of larger fish.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from more and bigger fish, ocean reserves often have a
greater variety of marine life than other waters, according to a UC
Santa Barbara study.</LD>
<LD>   This same happy "spillover effect" could be expected in Southern
California if state officials set aside 25% of the waters around the
Channel Islands as "no take" zones where fishing is banned, and if
federal and state managers hold firm against weakening an emergency
ban on taking threatened rockfish that was imposed only this summer.</LD>
<TE>   The rockfish ban has made 8,500 square miles of California's
continental shelf off-limits to fishing for rockfish and ling cod.
These fish have been decimated not only because they are dinner table
favorites--known as red snapper--but also because they don't begin to
reproduce until they are older than most other species; catching
younger rockfish is causing the population to crash because fewer
adults survive to reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists predict that both species will plunge toward extinction
if no ban is in place. Next month, the federal Pacific Fishery
Management Council will decide whether to extend the ban into next
year. It will take about 10 years to even begin to see recovery on
such slow-growing species, so it makes no sense to consider easing
it.</TE>
<TE>   The state Fish and Game Department, which is responsible for
drafting rules to enforce the ban, is under pressure from commercial
fishermen to carve out loopholes. It too should hold firm.</TE>
<TE>   The separate plan to create a string of no-fishing zones off the
Channel Islands, near Santa Barbara, comes before the state Fish and
Game Commission in December. It is the product of years of discussion
with commercial and recreational fishermen, state and federal
officials and environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The plan doesn't please everyone, but based on experience in
Florida and elsewhere, it should protect kelp beds, plankton blooms,
crabs, abalone, whales, dolphins and the many species of fish that
flourish in the imperiled, unique underwater environment where warm
and cold ocean streams meet off California.</TE>
<TE>   California's commercial and sport fishing industries, with
revenues of $1.4 billion annually, are important economic engines.
Many fishermen and sport guides, fearing loss of livelihood,
understandably oppose new limits. Like loggers now cutting
ever-smaller and less profitable trees, California's fishermen are
being asked to make short-term trade-offs to secure their future
economic survival. It's hard, but there's no better choice.</TE>

<LD>Shhhh. Listen.</LD>
<LD>   To what?</LD>
<LD>   Nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Ah, sweet silence. At last, some real quiet will be afforded
visitors to Grand Canyon National Park, 15 years after Congress told
the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration to
"substantially restore natural quiet" at the canyon by cutting back
on flights of sightseeing airplanes and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Congress, the FAA adopted regulations, supposedly
to limit the number of flights and to ban flights in parts of the
canyon. Even so, the number of flights soared from 40,000 to 130,000
a year from 1987 to now.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups sued, and now the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia has ordered the FAA to adopt a stricter
definition of "natural quiet" in regulating the overflights.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected the FAA practice of averaging the noise over a
year and using that as the daily limit. The result was many more
flights--and much more noise--in summer than in winter. The court
said the fact the park was quiet "on average" was cold comfort to a
summertime visitor.</TE>
<TE>   The court also said the FAA would have to factor in the noise of
commercial flights over the canyon when setting acceptable noise
regulations. The same court earlier told the agency to consider the
effect of flights over Zion National Park when approving a new
airport at nearby St. George, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups say the ruling signals a new attitude by the
courts in affirming that quiet is a natural resource of the parks and
should be protected like water and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling should be a factor as the Park Service reviews a
partial ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park. The Bush
administration has signaled that it will allow a certain amount of
snowmobiling to continue. Both snowmobiling and sightseeing flights
are banned in Yosemite Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the Grand Canyon flight operators said the new rules
would drive them out of business and deny the elderly and disabled a
chance to see Grand Canyon. That's not likely. The FAA could comply
simply by limiting flights, expanding no-fly zones or ordering the
operators to use quieter planes. And there is ample opportunity for
the elderly and the disabled to visit the canyon on the ground. Now,
that will be more pleasant. They and others may even be able to hear
the birds sing, the coyotes howl and the river gurgle.</TE>

<LD>That sinking, end-of-summer feeling is familiar. The traditional
school year is starting. That means more than textbooks, homework and
waking early to make the school bus. It also means a never-ending
series of marketing lessons for students who are inveigled into
raising cash for their pinched campuses. Opportunities to win a
limousine ride if they sell the most magazine subscriptions. Candy
sales between the lessons on nutrition and teenage obesity. And
surely everyone out there needs a few more rolls of wrapping paper.
At least when children ask for a pledge for their jog-a-thon, they're
getting a little exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The aunts, neighbors and parents' co-workers sigh, but no one has
the heart to protest too mightily.</LD>
<LD>   Those fund-raisers pay for things like safety scissors and lab
equipment and construction paper. They keep teachers from digging too
deeply into their own pockets so that kids, even those whose parents
can't afford crayons, can have supplies for learning.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it's reached the point where a little school reform is
needed for fund-raisers as well as for reading instruction. Instead
of buying that dozenth costly roll of wrapping paper, the community
could pledge a quarter for every 10 minutes spent reading to
bedridden elderly people in a nursing home. The students would get
some reading practice, the school would get the money and some lonely
people would be happier.</TE>
<TE>   Or how about a dollar for every bag of trash the students pick up
from the beach or a wildlife preserve? That's a lesson about the
environment and a cleaner world, as well as an enriched school.</TE>
<TE>   Or 10 cents for every head of cabbage they pick at a field that
grows produce for the hungry. A transformation in just one
fund-raising campaign each year at each school would make a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt about it, putting together a fund-raiser like this takes
more care than a commercially managed wrapping paper sale. Students
have to be supervised and kept safe in the less-controlled world off
campus. Schools manage this all the time with field trips, though.
And surely a walk along the beach to pick up garbage is as safe as
going around the neighborhood with magazine brochures.</TE>
<TE>   Helping out schools is fine. Learning the art of giving instead of
the art of selling is even better. We as a community need our
children's energetic good works more than we need oversized,
overpriced chocolate bars.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Crazy Quilt of Victim Compensation," Commentary, Aug. 18: My
family's case against Iran is singled out by Judge Richard Mosk as he
argues against continuing the federal law that allows terror victims
to collect compensation from state sponsors of terrorism. Mosk writes
that our seizure of Iranian assets is tantamount to Iran's seizure of
the American Embassy in Tehran. What he overlooks is that we act
through the U.S. courts using American law, following trial and
enforcement proceedings that Iran chose to ignore, whereas Iran's
takeover of our embassy was done by a mob controlled by Iran's
revolutionary apparatus.</LD>
<LD>   With congressional support from Democrats and Republicans and
discussions with the Clinton administration, the victims agreed to
seek satisfaction of their claims from assets other than Iran's
diplomatic properties on the condition that the U.S. reimburse itself
from Iranian cash under its control.</LD>
<LD>   The foreign policy of the U.S. is to defeat terror and its
sponsors. Ordinary citizens cannot send in the troops against those
who do us harm. The ability to put terror's sponsors out of business
by making it financially painful for them to continue their
activities is another weapon in America's arsenal.</LD>

<LD>I think those criticizing the boat cleanup plan are the ones missing
the mark (Aug. 25). One of ecologist Barry Commoner's many
contributions to the environmental movement was his simple
delineation of the planet's operating rules, including: Everything
goes somewhere. The boats need cleaning up, regardless of whether
they are spewing exhaust around L.A. or anywhere else. As a resident
of the "diesel death zone" around the ports, I say that it needs
cleaning up. Now. Not in 2004. Now!</LD>
<LD>   Andrea L. Bell</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The state has spent $25 million on diesel technology intended to
reduce smog in the L.A. harbor area. As a result, new engines have
been installed on 139 boats. That's $179,856 of taxpayer money spent
on each privately owned boat, boats that are reportedly deployed
outside the harbor area. The program is not cost-effective and it
isn't helping solve the problem of smog in the harbor area. Is this
an isolated waste of money, or is the program just one example of why
the state has a multibillion-dollar budget deficit?</TE>

<LD>Re "Hard Choices in a Genetic Calamity," Aug. 25: Today's medicine
will increasingly reflect new genetic treatments and hope. The
insurers do not want to pay for untested treatments or for hope. Hope
is not a sound business practice. There is no clear definition as to
when treatment becomes something more than an experiment.</LD>
<LD>   Especially in rare diseases like Sanfilippo syndrome, there is
less incentive for drug company research and clinical trials.</LD>
<LD>   We cannot, however, leave victims of rare diseases to die simply
because research on their illness is not cost-effective.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Mark Lipson of Kaiser Permanente, California's largest
insurer, is quoted as saying that the decision to refuse to pay for
the Bennett children's stem cell transplants was medically justified.</TE>
<TE>   It is never justified to refuse the only lifesaving treatment
available when that treatment is chosen by the patient or his or her
parent.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that this dilemma is perfectly suited for the insurance
industry, whose job is to spread the risk--and costs--of catastrophe.
This will have to be the topic of legislative efforts.</TE>

<TE>   Buried well back in your article about the unfortunate family
whose three children suffer from Sanfilippo syndrome and whose health
insurer--Kaiser Permanente--turned them down for a risky bone marrow
transplant was the revelation that three independent pediatric
consultants retained by the California Department of Managed Health
Care unanimously agreed with Kaiser Permanente.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that how HMO reform is supposed to work when disputes about
controversial procedures arise between health insurers and their
members?</TE>
<TE>   And why didn't the doctors at Duke University offer to make
research funds available to pay for what everyone acknowledges is
clearly an experimental, unproven treatment for a rare disorder?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As an ex-smoker, I am also disgusted by the idea of thousands of
cigarette butts littering the streets and ultimately being swept into
the ocean ("Litterbugs and Butts," letter, Aug. 26). I am confused,
however, about what smokers in largely pedestrian areas such as
Westwood, Venice, the promenades in Santa Monica and Pasadena, and
State Street in Santa Barbara are supposed to do with their
smoldering butts.</LD>
<LD>   Your letter writer suggests putting them in trash cans. Just how
many trash fires per block would he like to see on an average day?</LD>
<LD>   On a recent trip to Sydney, Australia, I noticed that the city has
placed hotel-style ashtrays filled with sand on sidewalks throughout
the central business district and the historic area called "the
Rocks." Smokers obviously use them; I almost never saw cigarette
butts crushed out on the streets or sidewalks in this delightfully
clean and friendly city.</LD>
<TE>   I know it may smack of "enabling" to rabidly anti-smoking
Californians, but if we really want to keep the streets clean of this
noxious litter, it might be a good idea to give smokers (including
many foreign tourists) a safe and handy place to dispose of their
used cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Grimwood</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I take great offense at categorizing all smokers as litterbugs.
I'm 33 years old, have been smoking since I was 12 and live a very
active and clean lifestyle. I am totally aware of my environment and
never litter.</TE>
<TE>   I live on Pacific Coast Highway and consistently have to pick up
cigarette butts from adolescents, tourists and people from the Valley
who think my carport is an ashtray. I know all about it.</TE>
<TE>   So why not complain about the tremendous amount of exhaust fumes
on our freeways, not to mention the daily carjackings, murders,
rapes, kidnappings, etc.? I'm simply sick and tired of these health
snobs telling me how to live my life and referring to me as a
litterbug simply because I smoke.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Big, Fat Windfall at the Box Office," Aug. 24:</LD>
<LD>   Steve Gilula of Fox Searchlight shows that he and most movie
executives still don't get it when he says, "What these movies have
in common is a very strong individual filmmaker point of view," in
noting the success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and other small
pictures. Their real link is not a strong filmmaker/director but a
well-written story with interesting, dimensional characters
constructed by a capable and clever writer, the most overlooked human
in the film equation.</LD>
<LD>   Joel Zwick, an incredibly talented, unfairly ignored director of
television and stage, wouldn't have had anything to direct if a
writer, in this case Nia Vardalos, hadn't pointed the way with vision
and promise.</LD>
<TE>   And if you don't believe me, ask Mr. Zwick.</TE>

<TE>   Having walked out of this movie after an hour, I am amazed that so
many people find it funny. The characters yelled at each other. The
boyfriend fell on the sidewalk. This is humorous?</TE>
<TE>   I didn't seem to be the only one unamused; during the hour I was
there, no one else in the whole theater laughed either, or even
giggled. Watching paint dry would be more interesting.</TE>

<LD>In "State's Poverty Profile Changes" (Aug. 26) you pointed out that,
in California, marriage doesn't have much of an effect on the
problem. However, you didn't compare apples with apples. Nowhere in
the article was it mentioned what the education level of the people
in poverty was. Nor did it mention to what extent people coming into
the U.S. illegally from Mexico may have contributed to the problem.</LD>
<LD>   I suggest that if you take the illegals out of the numbers and if
you compare apples with apples with respect to educational levels,
you will find the unemployment rate in California is much lower than
the number you are showing. I furthermore suggest that if you compare
similar education levels for legal citizens you will find that the
marrieds with children are doing far better than the unmarrieds with
children.</LD>
<LD>   One expert quoted said these people were doing everything right.
What he meant, however, was that a lot of them were married.</LD>
<TE>   But the truth is that a lot of them have very low education rates,
and a lot of them are people who are here illegally.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While it may not change anything as far as our demographics are
concerned, the "realities" of what is happening and will continue to
happen to our state should at least be acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Certain jobs are only worth so much in terms of income. If this
state, especially the southern part, continues to absorb hundreds of
thousands of poorly trained and poorly educated immigrants every
year, the impact on every part of life will be negative to a degree
we can only guess.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the figures run on the numbers of immigrants, both legal
and illegal, indicate that California is absorbing approximately 40%
of the national immigration figure. This, coupled with a very high
fertility rate among certain ethnic groups, precludes the ability to
create enough jobs no matter what type of work they might be willing
to accept.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the reluctance of both political parties to deal with
something that can be legally controlled--national immigration
quotas--our state is faced with the inevitable. A never-ending income
schism between the unskilled and skilled workers, extreme
overcrowding and tax demands for more and better schools and medical
facilities could erode the "quality of life" to a level of physical
concern.</TE>
<TE>   John H. Newby Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article refers to a National Center for Children in Poverty
study and states "most poor youngsters in California are the
offspring of at least one immigrant parent, and ... poor immigrant
families are more likely to include a breadwinner than are U.S.-born
families in poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere in this article does it state the average number of
children in these families.</TE>
<TE>   It is commendable that poor parents work hard to support their
families, but they should also carefully plan the size of their
families so that they can properly care for them.</TE>
<TE>   A scientific research team should include the average size of the
family in these statistics. It is logical that an unskilled worker's
salary will support fewer children than a skilled worker's higher
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   We need more information to draw conclusions.</TE>

<TE>   In "On Ethnicity, We're Rednecks One Day, Trailblazers the Next"

"we should have an honest conversation on population growth and
immigration."</TE>
<TE>   He goes on to identify some of the many serious problems we endure
in this state because of overpopulation.</TE>
<TE>   The issue sits there, big and fat, waiting to be addressed. Where
do our elected officials stand on this matter? What are they doing to
stem the tide of a growing population so that we will be able to
better manage the problems of the future?</TE>

<HD>Students and Tourette's: Build on Existing Help</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I commend Richard Dreyfuss for his Aug. 25 commentary, "Help in
Educating Kids With Tourette's." He accurately expresses the concerns
of many parents and educators. However, both California Education
Code provisions and the federal Individuals With Disabilities
Education Act currently provide for students with Tourette's
syndrome.</LD>
<LD>   In both instances the emphasis is on the disability, not the
label. Education Code Section 56026 identifies an individual with
exceptional needs as one whose impairment "requires instruction,
services, or both which cannot be provided with modification of the
regular school program." Likewise, Section 300.7 of the federal
education act identifies such a student. A student with Tourette's
can qualify for special education under both laws as "other health
impaired" and receive services stipulated in an individual education
program.</LD>
<LD>   Students with Tourette's syndrome have additional protections and
guarantees under Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act,
which provides that accommodations must be made for individuals whose
disability affects a "major life function." Learning is considered a
major life function.</LD>
<TE>   As Dreyfuss mentions, Congress is in the process of reauthorizing
the education act. Those of us concerned with all students with
disabilities are working together to ensure that they are guaranteed
the programs and services to which they are entitled.</TE>

<LD>As a foreign legal worker recently arrived with my family in L.A.
County, I found a local county health-care clinic, with services such
as physicals and vaccine updates for my kids, 3 and 6, to be good and
free of charge. I can't understand how the county would not spare
such an excellent facility and dedicated personnel without
considering options.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, allow the clinic's management to get its own
financial support, such as charging patients reasonable fees, or ask
the entire community to pledge money--the same way quality public
radio and TV do. As for myself, I can't afford $150 for a vaccine
shot, but I'm pretty sure I can pay $25; I could make the effort of
paying $25, or even more, on a monthly basis in order to keep the
clinic open. Wouldn't everyone?</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Logging alone won't solve the devastating fire problem in the Sierra.
Between 1980 and 1990, the Forest Service harvested [billions of]
board feet of timber, but still the forests burned hotter and more
extensively than any other time in living memory.</LD>
<LD>   Even the most conscientious logging operation leaves tons of
flammable "slash"--limbs, broken poles, crushed brush and splintered
wood. Slash chokes steep canyons and covers hillsides with a dry,
flammable carpet 10 feet thick or more. Big fires don't start in
healthy stands of commercial timber; they start in rotten snags
surrounded by thick deadwood or in tall, decadent brush fields.
Logging does little to control the conditions that lead to fire.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, without proper post-harvest fuels control, logging makes
the fire problem worse. In the old days, the Forest Service employed
brush crews to gather up slash and brush to burn in the fall after
the first rains. In the last 20 years, brush crews have almost
disappeared from the forests. Recently, the Forest Service has
experimented with aerial application of herbicides to control
post-logging and post-fire brush growth, but with little success.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes the old, labor-intensive ways are the best. The native
population of the Sierra--the Miwok, Mono and Yokut people--practiced
this: They gathered firewood, hand-cleared around oak trees and
burned the forest floor on a regular basis to keep the deadwood low
and the forests safe and healthy. Logging alone won't prevent
catastrophic fires; we must return to cultivating and tending our
forests as well.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Johnson</TE>
<TE>   Fresno</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is trying to enact new, common-sense laws to allow
logging in our national forests. It disturbs me to read the position
of the environmental groups. They claim the logging companies will
only log out the big trees and leave the "junk brush" and little
trees. It is in the best interest of the logging companies to remove
this low growth for three reasons: to get in to the trees and work;
for the new seedlings that they will be planting to grow, thus
ensuring them future crops of trees; in case of fire, so it won't
have fuel to spread and destroy their future crops.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up in Marin County and for the past six years have lived in
the foothills near Sequoia National Forest. We who live near and in
the forest understand the environment. When I come back to the Bay
Area and talk to people there, they are so ignorant of the true ways
to preserve the forests--they just believe the nonsense of the
environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   Mayra S. Paldon</TE>
<TE>   Badger, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a longtime Forest Service biologist, I have witnessed firsthand
the sad condition of our national forests. The reasons the forests
are in such sad shape are the over-harvesting of large,
fire-resistant trees for profit and allowing kindling to build up
along with dense stands of a monoculture tree-farm-like imitation
forest, while extinguishing every fire for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Thinning should be focused in all areas of the forests where there
are roads and previous harvesting histories. No new roads or old
growth should be included in this plan.</TE>
<TE>   We should fix what we have mismanaged and not continue to deny the
facts based on profit incentive. It is time to get real on this
issue. If the Forest Service continues to try to sell old-growth
timber where little remains, the problem will only worsen.</TE>

<TE>   I have to commend Bush on his consistency. Whenever there is an
opportunity to push forward the short-term interests of corporate
profits at the expense of our nation's wildlife (and the American
people), he pounces on it. His latest proposal to prevent forest
fires by cutting down forests is made even more shameful by his
transparent claims to be concerned about the environment. Bush is
only concerned with selling our natural resources at discount prices
to his corporate friends.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Scaff</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rather than waiving environmental laws so the timber industry can
log more big trees in the back country, the administration should
protect communities close to our national forests that are at
unnecessary risk from fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service should ensure that 90% of the expenditures on
fuel reduction in national forests occurs within 500 meters of a
community's buildings, the area known as the community protection
zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should start protecting communities and
national forests rather than the profits of the timber industry.
Congress should reject the Bush administration's Healthy Forests
Initiative.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As I read "Bill Seeks to Lighten Kids' Load" (Aug. 27), I couldn't
help but remember how some very petite engineering students handled
the problem of the heavy backpack in the 1990s. They used to copy
their textbooks a chapter at a time, and carry only the material
currently being studied with them in a three-ring binder.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps textbook publishers could sell the books to schools in a
ready-for-the-binder format. Children could check out the chapter
currently being studied from their teachers and transport it to and
from school in a binder. Six chapters have to weigh less than six
books--especially if there is no hardback cover. Publishers could
make up the difference on purchase price by selling schools the right
to copy as many pages as they need to replace lost chapters. Or maybe
chapters could be reprinted with permission over the Internet.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although I agree with the fact that students' backpacks are too
heavy for them to carry around all day, I had to laugh at the
solution of publishers "lightening" their texts. I teach eighth-grade
pre-algebra and algebra, and we have adopted new textbooks twice in
two years. One reason for this is that the old texts did not match up
to the state's standards. Since more material needs to be covered in
each grade, the textbooks have gotten quite weighty.</TE>
<TE>   I have tried to order a class set of texts so that my students can
keep one book at home and there is one in my classroom, but I have
been told that the budget does not allow us to have class sets. Would
it not be more cost-effective to allocate money to the schools'
budgets for the purchasing of these sets instead of purchasing all
new texts in a smaller version?</TE>
<TE>   In addition to lessening the load for our students, only one set
of books would get damaged, while most of the books would stay in
relatively good condition. This would cut down on the cost of
replacing the damaged and lost books.</TE>

<TE>   A better idea would be to give each child a notebook computer and
put all the books on CD-ROM.</TE>
<TE>   You could fit all the books from all the subjects for all the
grades on one CD if it was well done. Each district could compile its
own custom CD. The publishers would save all those printing costs and
may even pass some of that along.</TE>
<TE>   And while they are at it, the use of open-source software should
be mandated as well.</TE>

<TE>   The solutions that legislators drum up always baffle me. Rather
than splitting textbooks in half, why don't we legislate cutting the
ridiculous homework loads in half? It would cost nothing and children
would regain some of their childhood now buried in heavy textbooks.</TE>

<HD>Court Opens Fenced Beach to Public Use</HD>
<DH>Access: Coastal activists hail as precedent a ruling on a
stretch of Malibu land donated to a state conservancy in exchange for
the right to expand some beachfront homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pristine section of Malibu beach that homeowners want to keep
fenced off must be opened to the public, the California Court of
Appeal has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Overturning a lower court decision, the appellate court said
Thursday that an 80-foot swath at the north end of La Costa Beach may
be opened, complete with a viewing platform and a stairway from
Pacific Coast Highway to the sand.</LD>
<LD>   Coastal activists hailed the decision and said it set a strong
precedent for opening other areas to visitors.</LD>
<TE>   "It's outstanding," said Peter Douglas, executive director of the
California Coastal Commission. "And this is obviously going to be
very important in terms of potential future litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the La Costa Beach Homeowners Assn., which has
sought to keep the beach closed, were unavailable Friday, as were
their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   They have argued that the stretch of PCH is too dangerous for
parking, that the ocean there has treacherous riptides and that the
Coastal Commission had no right to obtain that section of beach for
public use.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, they claimed that the commission acted illegally
when it allowed businessman Eli Broad, Nancy Daly Riordan (wife of
the former Los Angeles mayor) and television magnate Haim Saban to
donate that piece of land in exchange for the right to expand their
own beachfront houses a mile or so down the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, the land would be developed and maintained by the
California Coastal Conservancy, sister agency to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge agreed with
the homeowners, saying that so-called off-site mitigation was not
permitted under the 30-year-old Coastal Access Act.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, the Court of Appeal overturned that decision,
ruling that the Coastal Commission has a mandate to maximize public
access whenever possible. The decision can be appealed to the state
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The La Costa Beach Homeowners Assn. has filed another lawsuit
against the Coastal Conservancy, again alleging that the
conservancy's acceptance of the land was not consistent with the
Coastal Access Act.</TE>
<TE>   That lawsuit was put on hold pending the resolution of this case.
If that lawsuit prevails, Broad, Daly and Saban have set aside $1
million to improve access elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But access activists hope that won't happen, while at the same
time acknowledging that the fight for public access in Malibu is by
no means won.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the beautiful, jagged, 27-mile coastline is taken up with
expensive houses that show a closed face to the highway but open onto
the beach as if it were a private backyard. Legally, everything
seaward of the mean high-tide line is public property.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say they fear for their security, as beachgoers have
been known to march over that line into private homes, or use their
personal property to compensate for the lack of public restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over access in Malibu goes back more than 100 years. In
the early decades of the 20th century, an eccentric widow hired
armed, mounted guards to patrol the boundaries of Rancho Malibu until
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1925 forced her to open her land to make
way for Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, homeowners promised to allow public walkways in
exchange for building permits. In many cases, however, the walkways
never were built. But now, as the commitments are about to expire,
groups are taking steps to open them up.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday evening, the Legislature approved a bill that would
require the Coastal Conservancy to assume control of any access ways
that are in danger of reverting to the homeowner because the
agreements will expire. The bill is now headed for the governor's
desk.</TE>
<TE>   But lawsuits have greeted attempts to create access in the past.
Entertainment mogul David Geffen earlier this summer sued a nonprofit
group and state officials who have been trying to open his wooden
gate so visitors can reach the beach. A similar legal battle is
underway in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this the end of the fight? Nah," said Steve Hoye, executive
director of Access for All, a group that fights for public beach use.
"The homeowners have had these beaches for many years.... It will be
a beach-by-beach struggle."</TE>

<HD>When God Gets the Blame</HD>
<DH>Healing: It's only natural to strike out after a disaster.
But believers usually reconsider and accept it as God's will.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Fatticci was a pastor's wife who loved the Lord and served as
an active partner in her husband's ministry for two decades.</LD>
<LD>   But when she became a widow with three adolescents at 46, she
became so angry with God that she yelled at him.</LD>
<LD>   "What are you doing here? I don't understand," Fatticci, a
substitute teacher, remembers shouting while driving alone. Even when
she took walks with a friend, she let God have it. How could he let
John, pastor to the deaf at First Baptist Church of Lakewood, die of
cancer? How could he let him suffer for four years? "We were doing
everything right. We were honoring you!"</LD>
<TE>   Historian Gerald Sittser had also long been a man of faith. An
ordained minister with a doctorate in the history of Christianity
from the University of Chicago, Sittser served as a pastor in Los
Angeles before taking a professorship at Whitworth College in
Spokane, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   But after witnessing three generations of his family--his mother,
wife and a daughter--die in a head-on collision caused by a drunk
driver, he felt betrayed by God. "I've been faithful to you for
years," he remembers crying in anguish. "How could you do this to
innocent people?" He scoffed at the notion of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Even people of abiding faith can find themselves railing at God
after irreparable losses. Fatticci and Sittser believe the anger,
though surprising and sometimes guilt provoking, was a necessary part
of a journey that strengthened their faith and stretched their souls.</TE>
<TE>   Wrestling with God in the darkest moments, they say, led them to
conclude, much as Job did, that God is too great for us to
understand. That realization made other people more precious to them
and allowed them to grow more sensitive, more loving, more generous
with their time.</TE>
<TE>   The Old and New Testaments are rich with people who implored God
in anger, disappointment and frustration. "The book of the Psalms,
which is the primary devotional literature of the whole Bible, is
full of complaints," said David Augsburger, professor of pastoral
care and counseling at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   A long list of men who encountered God--Abraham, Moses, Job,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea and Amos--expressed anger as well as
submission, said Augsburger, a clinical psychologist, ordained
Mennonite minister and noted author. Even Jesus cried out from the
cross: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</TE>
<TE>   Augsburger, who trains ministers and clinical psychologists, said
people who are upset with God should vent their anger. Anger, he
said, is simply a demand for justice. Repressed, this demand turns to
guilt: the grieving person's belief that he, or even the person he
lost, was in some way responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "When you validate their anger, the demand doesn't spring back and
boomerang on them," Augsburger said. His first aim in trying to help
people who are angry with God is "to invite them to express fully
what's in their pain, hear the pain and encourage them to go on to
lament it." When they lament, he said, they are crying out, not only
to the listener in front of them, but also to God.</TE>
<TE>   "Our churches and society tend to give us messages that it's not
good to be mad at God; it's blasphemy, we'll be struck by lightning
or that we're not enough of a person of faith," said clinical
psychologist Michele Novotni, co-author of "Angry With God."</TE>
<TE>   Because God already knows everything about us, including our
attitudes, it's best to be "open and honest about our anger and let
God do the healing," said the Rev. Mark Brewer, senior pastor of Bel
Air Presbyterian Church.</TE>
<TE>   When Brewer was a junior in high school, his father, a pastor in
Colorado, left his family and the ministry to marry his secretary.
Two years later, Brewer's fiancee was killed by a hit-and-run driver.</TE>
<TE>   Then, over the next 15 years, his older brother died of leukemia
and a younger brother, a Presbyterian minister in St. Louis who had
lost a leg in a train accident and was suffering depression,
committed suicide, leaving behind three children, two of them
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord," Brewer remembers thinking the day he stood over his
fiancee's body, "if this is what trusting you means, I want to
renegotiate the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tragedies in his life--Brewer calls them "big
waves"--made him want to get far away from God. Yet, try as he might,
he couldn't. God "was holding my boat and wouldn't let me go." He
compares his experience to that of a toddler, kicking and screaming
in a father's strong arms. After ranting, he finally let God hold and
hug him.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer said people of no or little faith are less likely to become
angry with God because their expectations are lower. "But when you
come to an understanding that the Lord is in control, then you want
to say, 'Why did you allow this?' "</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist Novotni compared reconciling anger with God to
patching up a relationship with someone close who has hurt us, so
that we're eventually able to say, "I don't know what to do with this
piece, but because this relationship [with God] is important, I will
not let that be an obstacle."</TE>
<TE>   That's the approach John Fry, a Costa Mesa psychologist, and his
wife, Elizabeth, an attorney, took in the loss of their twins.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan and David died in October after they were born
prematurely. Despite his years of training and counseling others,
John Fry wasn't prepared for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Confusion and puzzlement were part of my experience," he said.
"How would God allow something like this to happen?" he asked. His
anger made him uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the clay [Fry] tell the potter [God], 'You're making me
wrong?' " he said, paraphrasing Romans 9:20,21: "Shall what is formed
say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?' Does the
potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some
pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?"</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Fry let God off the hook. The idea of forgiving God
seemed presumptuous, but he made himself tell God: "I don't know why
[you took the babies], but I love you anyway."</TE>
<TE>   "I still have times of real sadness, hoping that some day I will
see my boys," Fry said, his voice cracking. Elizabeth Fry, who has
compiled a scrapbook of pictures of the twins, consoles herself that
God let her have "my boys," even if only for a brief time.</TE>
<TE>   I sought out Fatticci, Sittser, Brewer and the Frys weeks after I
too wrestled with God.</TE>
<TE>   I never thought that I'd be shaking my puny fist at the God I had
praised, trusted and worshipped all my life. But when my younger
brother--my only sibling--died suddenly last month, I was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" I cried out. Emmanuel, a gentle soul who played violin and
piano beautifully, was only 48. He had no history of heart trouble,
yet he died of cardiac arrest shortly before we were to have a
cookout on a Friday evening after work.</TE>
<TE>   His was the seventh death in four years in my inner circle,
including both parents. I couldn't fathom why God was sending so many
deaths my way.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to crush me, how about doing it quickly?" I told God.
"Thanks to you, I have more people I love on the other side of the
great beyond than here."</TE>
<TE>   My fury shocked me. But it also prodded me to find others who had
experienced it. To reread the Psalms, Job, Lamentations. To read half
a dozen books, ranging from C.S. Lewis' "A Grief Observed" to Philip
Yancy's "Disappointment with God" and Gerald Sittser's "A Grief
Observed: How the Soul Grows Through Loss," which I found especially
helpful.</TE>
<TE>   The people I interviewed, the books I read and a friend named
Charles, who comes to see me every evening to hear me sigh and mutter
"What's the meaning of this?" have put me on the road to healing--and
to forgiving God.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorrow never entirely leaves the soul of those who have suffered
a severe loss," Sittser writes in "A Grace Disguised." "Deep sorrow
often has the effect of stripping life of pretense, vanity and waste.
It forces us to ask basic questions." Already, I can sense that my
faith will grow, even as I continue in my struggle to understand the
meaning of my brother's early death and ponder what I can do to bring
the good out of the sorrow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big of God to allow us to be angry with him," said
theologian F. Dale Bruner of Pasadena. "The Psalms are at least half
complaint, and God seems to have encouraged those prayers to be put
into his book because he knew how angry people would understandably
be with him and with life.</TE>
<TE>   "God apparently knows very well that he does not always seem to be
very thrilling or to be sitting all that wisely on his throne."</TE>

<HD>'Terrorist' Tape Termed Hoax; Tipster in Jail</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Suspect stages event at Santa Ana hotel and gives
video to officials. Man on film, who said he would attack Disneyland,
is freed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The videotape obtained by the FBI was chilling: A man calling himself
an Islamic terrorist armed with a shoe bomb, gas canisters and a gun
claimed he and four others were planning a Sept. 11 attack on
Disneyland against "our enemies."</LD>
<LD>   Authorities acted swiftly. Dozens of law officers, including FBI
counterterrorism agents, raided the man's Santa Ana mobile home
Thursday. More than 100 stunned neighbors were evacuated. The suspect
was arrested.</LD>
<LD>   But no weapons or explosives were found.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Liyanase Tony Fernando was released from jail, and the
informant who provided the tape to officials was behind bars for
allegedly setting up authorities for an elaborate hoax.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say Jose Roberto Dominguez II, 22, of Anaheim
staged the videotaping in a Santa Ana hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   They say that he fashioned an "explosive vest" by spray-painting
cans black, gluing lamp cords to them and putting them on the
garment.</TE>
<TE>   He also allegedly put flammable powder inside the drilled-out sole
of a shoe. The gun was plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez told authorities he believed that Fernando, whom he said
he recently met at a Garden Grove Islamic center and knew as "Imran,"
was capable of carrying out a suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "But Dominguez was overzealous in his efforts to show this,"
according to the federal complaint against him, alleging that he made
a false report.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez's attorney said in court Friday that her client was a
freelance journalist who stumbled upon what he thought was a story.
Dominguez was ordered held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   The "terrorist" featured in the videotape, authorities say, was in
fact Fernando. As to why he dressed up for Dominguez's camera and
made the statements, "I have no clue," said Assistant U.S. Atty.
Kevin Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Reached Friday afternoon at home, Fernando declined to comment on
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials "told me not to speak to anyone or say
anything," Fernando said, adding that he "didn't know anything" about
the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Dominguez on Wednesday gave the
videotape to a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, who turned it
over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Fernando is seen on a couch in a hotel room, waving
what appears to be a .45-caliber handgun and wearing the
canister-laden vest, which he says contains C-4 explosives and gas.</TE>
<TE>   He is being interviewed by someone off camera, who asks what his
target is. Disneyland on Sept. 11, Fernando says. Four other "Muslim
brothers" armed with machine guns will be with him, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He holds up a running shoe, which he says contains C-4. Dominguez
enters the scene, removes adhesive backing from the shoe and shakes
out some dark powder.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez then puts a lighter to the powder, and it erupts in a
flash.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez told FBI agents that he met Fernando six weeks earlier,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   He said Fernando told him he was affiliated with the Abu Nidal
terrorist organization and professed a hatred of Americans, calling
them "white devils."</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the tape, authorities got search warrants for
Fernando's vehicle and home in the Stoneridge Mobile Home Park.</TE>
<TE>   When nothing was found, agents interviewed Dominguez again.</TE>
<TE>   He allegedly confessed to concocting the tape and the story behind
it, including the Sept. 11 date and Disneyland as the target, and he
apologized, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the mobile home park Friday, neighbors said they were shocked
when Fernando was arrested by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "Our reaction was, 'You got to be kidding. That guy?' He's a nice
guy; always plays with his kids," said Duncan McNeill, 67.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said he didn't mind the evacuation, that it was better to
err on the side of caution, if it was only a hoax.</TE>

<HD>Charter Schools Face New Rules</HD>
<DH>Education: Davis is expected to sign bill to tighten
regulation of the campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's largely unregulated charter schools face a new set of
financial and geographic restrictions under a bill that passed both
houses of the Legislature this week.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno), is
among the first major reforms of charter schools since the state
approved the concept of allowing private organizations to open, or
"charter," public schools a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Though the legislation passed largely along party lines with
Democrats in favor, Reyes' bill merged several different bills in a
compromise that won the grudging support of many of California's
charter schools. Davis administration officials said they expect the
governor to sign the bill into law.</LD>
<TE>   Charter schools are monitored by the individual school districts
that approve them. But in California, several charter holders have
used their grants to open up multiple campuses--sometimes across the
state from the districts, making oversight difficult. Central to the
reform is a requirement that charters be based in the same county as
the school district that monitors them.</TE>
<TE>   "Charters have spread across the state, but this will force them
to be more accountable and local," said Reyes. "By forcing them to
locate closer to the district that charters them, there will be more
oversight, more local scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the legislation say that problems have been isolated
and that new regulations represent an attack on an approach whose
promise lies in its relative freedom from regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "This restricts the opportunity of successful charters to spread
their success to satellite campuses," said Assemblywoman Lynne Leach
(R-Walnut Creek), who voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed law also sets up basic financial and curricular
oversight. Charter schools will have to account annually for their
receipts and expenditures, and perform special audits if they close.
They will be required to tell parents whether the classes they offer
correlate with state requirements for college entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Larson, a spokesman for the California Network of Educational
Charters, which represents about 70% of the state's charter schools,
said that 50 schools--representing about 200 separate
campuses--operate outside the counties where they are chartered.
Under the bill, they will have until June 2005 to either relocate,
shut down, or seek a new charter in the district where they are
located.</TE>
<TE>   That burden may fall heaviest on the California Charter Academy,
which has used charters in a handful of small school districts to
launch a statewide network of 60 schools serving 6,000 students. A
spokesman for the California Charter Academy promised Friday to
comply with the proposed law but declined to provide details.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana to Scrap Leaked Police Test</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Probe of how questions were revealed is
underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Police Department has scrapped the results of an exam
taken by 107 officers seeking to become corporals after officials
learned that some got an early look at the questions.</LD>
<LD>   The city attorney's office is investigating because the test was
administered by Santa Ana's personnel department. Officials said they
are not sure how the questions were leaked or who was responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Carona, a police department spokesman, said that when the
city finishes its probe, the case will be turned over to the
department's internal affairs division. Officers found to have
cheated on the exam could be fired, demoted or reprimanded.</LD>
<TE>   Candidates were notified that the results were being tossed out by
an e-mail sent Aug. 8 by Mike Ernandes, a personnel office
supervisor. He said some officers received test questions in study
materials they were sent.</TE>
<TE>   "It has come to my attention that there were some irregularities
in the written examination," Ernandes said in the e-mail, a copy of
which was obtained under the California Public Records Act.</TE>
<TE>   The written test was given July 24 and included multiple-choice
and fill-in-the-blank questions about police procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Those who passed would have been eligible to become a corporal, a
rank between officer and sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   The exam was the first conducted since 1998, said Sgt. Baltazar De
La Riva, police spokesman. A new exam will now be scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Police and city officials would not comment on how they learned
that the questions were leaked.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time a test may be compromised, the best solution is to
cancel the exam and schedule another one," said Henry Alva, head of
personnel for the city.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran Santa Ana officer, speaking anonymously, said about 30
officers received questions in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The officer, who didn't take the test, said the controversy has
created animosity on the part of exam takers who did not get
questions beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't do anything wrong and they were looking forward to
the opportunity to be promoted," the officer said.</TE>

<HD>Edwin Cole, 79; Led Christian Men's Network</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edwin Louis Cole, considered the father of the Christian men's
movement that has spawned huge Promise Keepers gatherings around the
country, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   The president and founder of the nondenominational Christian Men's
Network, Cole died Tuesday of bone marrow cancer at his home in
Grapevine, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Cole, who described his ministering style as confrontational,
founded the organization, which focuses exclusively on men, in 1979.</LD>
<TE>   For the next 20 years, he traveled the world commanding men to
"repent of sex sins."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote 14 books, including "Maximized Manhood," "Strong Men in
Tough Times" and "The Irresistible Husband."</TE>
<TE>   He also recorded more than 1,000 audiotapes and produced more than
200 instructional videos, according to the Christian Men's Network.</TE>
<TE>   Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney has credited Cole with
paving the way for his organization and other men's ministries.</TE>
<TE>   "For me personally, he's a mentor," McCartney told the Dallas
Morning News in a 1998 interview. "I like everything about him.</TE>
<TE>   "I like his style, his spirit, his longevity," McCartney said.
"He's unrelenting, persevering."</TE>
<TE>   Cole moved to Los Angeles from Dallas with his family at age 5. He
was raised as a Pentecostal and ordained as an Assemblies of God
minister.</TE>
<TE>   He began his men-only ministry when he was 57.</TE>
<TE>   Cole's Christian Men's Network has ministered to millions of men
through events, retreats, church services, videos, radio, television,
books, tapes and satellite broadcasts, according to the organization.
It has representatives serving in more than 210 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Cole lived in Southern California for much of his life, and
returned to Texas in the early 1990s to be closer to the base of
operations of his Christian Men's Network.</TE>
<TE>   He will be buried in Newport Beach, alongside his wife of 54
years, Nancy Corbett Cole, who died nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by one son, two daughters, nine grandchildren and
one great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>State Budget Impasse Hits Home for Agencies That Serve the
Disabled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON and VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eviction notice arrived early in the morning, just as the
landlords warned it would. Having failed to pay rent for the last two
months, Communities Actively Living Independent and Free, an
independent-living center that provides advocacy and services for
disabled people in 50 Southern California Zip Codes, must vacate.</LD>
<LD>   At CALIF, located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles at Broadway
and 9th Street, the creamy bond stationery calling for $11,270 in
back rent--money the group should have received from the state by
now--has brought home the state's budget deadlock with fearful
immediacy.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an emergency," said Lillibeth Navarro, founding director
of CALIF. "We've tried to be responsible. We had three months of
reserve funds, but we've gone through them, and now I don't know what
we're going to do."</LD>
<TE>   Of all the people hurt by the state's nine-week budget deadlock,
advocates for people with disabilities say their clients are poised
to suffer not mere inconveniences, but life-changing consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Independent-living agencies such as CALIF and the state's 21
regional centers help disabled people obtain in-home care, respite
care, affordable housing, employment and peer counseling. It is such
a fragile chain of services that, when one link is withdrawn, it can
thrust a disabled person who lives at home and has a job into a
nursing home and unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Kim and Randy Horton, both of whom use wheelchairs and rely on
in-home care for their independence, tremble for the unity of their
15-year marriage. Randy uses a computer to speak, and the green
T-shirt he wears reads: "Not being able to speak is not the same as
having nothing to say."</TE>
<TE>   "Randy asked me, 'What if they put us in nursing homes?' " Kim
said Thursday. " 'What if they split us up?' But I'll sleep in the
street before I go into an institution."</TE>
<TE>   Exacerbating the frustration the Hortons and many other disabled
people say they feel is a growing sense of powerlessness in the face
of political machinations</TE>
<TE>   "What's infuriating is that there is money, but we're not treated
as equals in setting policy," Navarro said. "We're not behind closed
doors making deals. We serve the poorest of the poor."</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1969 as a result of the Lanterman Developmental
Disabilities Act, regional centers are private, nonprofit,
community-based agencies that contract annually with the state
Department of Developmental Services. But the contracts expired with
the old budget, and the state, with few exceptions, is not allowed to
pay for services without them.</TE>
<TE>   California's 21 regional centers serve 170,000 disabled people.
Since July 1, when a new fiscal year began without a state budget,
most centers have relied on lines of credit from banks to stay open,
but those are nearly exhausted. Many have notified clients and their
families that unless a budget is passed, they will be forced to shut
down by mid-September. Others say they can last until mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Regional centers recently received a little breathing room from
the state controller's office. A 1998 statute requires the state to
continue to pay for disabled services and certain others through
August in the event a budget is not enacted.</TE>
<TE>   The Regional Center of Orange County, whose $20-million note is
scheduled to come due Tuesday, will now be able to stay open a few
days into October, said Executive Director Bill Bowman.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're telling our vendors and staff is, 'Don't relax. Don't
think this is the end of the problem,' " Bowman said. "We keep
hearing noises from a variety of sources that say this impasse could
go deep into October. We've overheard the possibility that it could
go to the last official day for the Legislature to submit a bill,
which is Nov. 15. We'll be dead by then."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Brees, who receives services through the Orange County
center, is holding his breath. Because of cerebral palsy, Brees, 50,
cannot walk, stand or sit upright extensively in his wheelchair. Each
morning, at Brees' one-bedroom apartment in Fullerton, an attendant
helps him out of bed, into clothes and then cooks for him. A similar
routine occurs in the evening. The few hours of help each day allows
him to live independently, slip over to Starbucks for a latte, write
poetry and read novels.</TE>
<TE>   "I rely on disability services I get for a better quality of
life," Brees said. "I would be much more isolated otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, disability advocates have stepped up their
lobbying of Democrats and Republicans, exhorting both sides to come
to a budget compromise, which has stalled over a disagreement about
how to close a $23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, scores of disabled people, homecare workers and advocates
picketed in front of the state offices in downtown Los Angeles,
shouting for Gov. Gray Davis to sign a budget.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' spokesman Byron Tucker pointed out that Davis would like to
sign a budget but cannot until the Legislature approves one, but few
heard him. Navarro handed Tucker a mock cardboard Supplemental
Security Income check for $750, saying the governor should try to
live on it, the way many disabled people do.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Thursday, Navarro, the Hortons and a handful of
demonstrators planted themselves in Assemblyman Keith Richman's
Granada Hills district office, having been told that he was one of a
few Republican holdouts on the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Richman's district staff emphasized that the former physician was
aware of their distress and, far from holding out on the budget, has
been working around the clock with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   After two hours of cordial conversation, the small group left--but
not before pointing out that the office building lacks the
appropriate handicapped signage. Richman's district representative
Gary Washburn thanked them for putting a face on the budget crisis.
"It makes it real," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Snapped Navarro: "It should have been real Day 1!"</TE>

<HD>Budget Deadlock Hits Home for Disabled Centers Awaiting
Funding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON and VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eviction notice arrived early in the morning, just as the
landlords warned it would. Having failed to pay rent for the last two
months, Communities Actively Living Independent and Free, an
independent-living center that provides advocacy and services for
disabled people in 50 Southern California Zip Codes, must vacate.</LD>
<LD>   At CALIF, located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles at Broadway
and 9th Street, the creamy bond stationery calling for $11,270 in
back rent--money the group should have received from the state by
now--has brought home the state's budget deadlock with fearful
immediacy.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an emergency," said Lillibeth Navarro, founding director
of CALIF. "We've tried to be responsible. We had three months of
reserve funds, but we've gone through them, and now I don't know what
we're going to do."</LD>
<TE>   Of all the people hurt by the state's nine-week budget deadlock,
advocates for people with disabilities say their clients are poised
to suffer not mere inconveniences, but life-changing consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Independent-living agencies such as CALIF and the state's 21
regional centers help disabled people obtain in-home care, respite
care, affordable housing, employment and peer counseling. It is such
a fragile chain of services that, when one link is withdrawn, it can
thrust a disabled person who lives at home and has a job into a
nursing home and unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Kim and Randy Horton, both of whom use wheelchairs and rely on
in-home care for their independence, tremble for the unity of their
15-year marriage. Randy uses a computer to speak, and the green
T-shirt he wears reads: "Not being able to speak is not the same as
having nothing to say."</TE>
<TE>   "Randy asked me, 'What if they put us in nursing homes?' " Kim
said Thursday. " 'What if they split us up?' But I'll sleep in the
street before I go into an institution."</TE>
<TE>   Exacerbating the frustration the Hortons and many other disabled
people say they feel is a growing sense of powerlessness in the face
of political machinations</TE>
<TE>   "What's infuriating is that there is money, but we're not treated
as equals in setting policy," Navarro said. "We're not behind closed
doors making deals. We serve the poorest of the poor."</TE>
<TE>   No Budget, No Contract</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1969 as a result of the Lanterman Developmental
Disabilities Act, regional centers are private, nonprofit,
community-based agencies that contract annually with the state
Department of Developmental Services. But the contracts expired with
the old budget, and the state, with few exceptions, is not allowed to
pay for services without them.</TE>
<TE>   California's 21 regional centers serve 170,000 disabled people.
Since July 1, when a new fiscal year began without a state budget,
most centers have relied on lines of credit from banks to stay open,
but those are nearly exhausted. Many have notified clients and their
families that unless a budget is passed, they will be forced to shut
down by mid-September. Others say they can last until mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Regional centers recently received a little breathing room from
the state controller's office. A 1998 statute requires the state to
continue to pay for disabled services and certain others through
August in the event a budget is not enacted.</TE>
<TE>   The Regional Center of Orange County, whose $20-million note is
scheduled to come due Tuesday, will now be able to stay open a few
days into October, said Executive Director Bill Bowman.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're telling our vendors and staff is, 'Don't relax. Don't
think this is the end of the problem,' " Bowman said. "We keep
hearing noises from a variety of sources that say this impasse could
go deep into October. We've overheard the possibility that it could
go to the last official day for the Legislature to submit a bill,
which is Nov. 15. We'll be dead by then."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Brees, who receives services through the Orange County
center, is holding his breath. Because of cerebral palsy, Brees, 50,
cannot walk, stand or sit upright extensively in his wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Each morning, at Brees' one-bedroom apartment in Fullerton, an
attendant helps him out of bed, into clothes and then cooks for him.
A similar routine occurs in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The few hours of help each day allows him to live independently,
slip over to Starbucks for a latte, write poetry and read novels.</TE>
<TE>   "I rely on disability services I get for a better quality of
life," Brees said. "I would be much more isolated otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Turning Up the Pressure</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, disability advocates have stepped up their
lobbying of Democrats and Republicans, exhorting both sides to come
to a budget compromise, which has stalled over a disagreement about
how to close a $23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, scores of disabled people, homecare workers and advocates
picketed in front of the state offices in downtown Los Angeles,
shouting for Gov. Gray Davis to sign a budget.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' spokesman Byron Tucker pointed out that Davis would like to
sign a budget but cannot until the Legislature approves one, but few
heard him. Navarro handed Tucker a mock cardboard Supplemental
Security Income check for $750, saying the governor should try to
live on it, the way many disabled people do.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Thursday, Navarro, the Hortons and a handful of

Granada Hills district office, having been told that he was one of a
few Republican holdouts on the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Richman's district staff emphasized that the former physician was

<TE>   After two hours of cordial conversation, the small group left--but
not before pointing out that the office building lacks the
appropriate handicapped signage. Richman's district representative
Gary Washburn thanked them for putting a face on the budget crisis.
"It makes it real," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Snapped Navarro: "It should have been real Day 1!"</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arson investigators looking into a quickly growing forest fire Friday
in the Lytle Creek area of San Bernardino County found the badly
burned body of a man, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery occurred on a day when a helicopter crashed while
dropping water on the fire. The pilot was not injured.</LD>
<LD>   About 5:30 a.m., investigators found the body of a man in an open
field, said Sheriff's Sgt. Frank Gonzales. An abandoned car was
several hundred yards away, and both were near the origin of the
fire, Gonzales said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives are investigating whether there is a connection between
the body and the car.</TE>

<LD>John Martins remembers watching with boyhood awe as the World Trade
Center was being built across the river from his home in New Jersey
more than 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   New York's 110-story twin towers were more than architectural
wonders--they represented the future and opportunity that awaited
Martins outside his working-class Newark neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a symbol of what was good about America," Martins said.
"You were on top of the world when you were there."</LD>
<TE>   Martins was so taken with the majesty of the skyscrapers that he
proposed to his wife, Rose, at a restaurant on the 106th floor of the
north tower. Years later it would be his wife who broke the news to
him about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like all of a sudden, we were so vulnerable," said
Martins, 43, now a Moorpark resident. "Before, we had these big
symbols of might. And then, after 9/11, it felt like anything could
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Martins will have a chance to honor the victims of the attacks by
joining dozens of other recreational pilots from around the country
who have volunteered to ferry their state flags to New York City for
a special tribute Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Flight Across America will include an "air parade" of low-flying
planes along the Hudson River corridor, past the Statue of Liberty
and ground zero. The event will culminate with the presentation of
the state flags to New York City officials aboard the decommissioned
aircraft carrier Intrepid in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   For Martins, who has not been back to New Jersey since Sept. 11,
Flight Across America offers more than a chance to visit his old
neighborhood and see ground zero for himself. "In a way, it's kind of
like coming home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martins and his copilot, Camarillo resident Ken Coolidge, plan to
leave Tuesday from Camarillo Airport. They will fly in Martins'
blue-and-white six-seat Piper Saratoga II TC.</TE>
<TE>   Coolidge, 65, earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and 12 air
medals during his military career. Now a part-time flight instructor,
Coolidge helped Martins earn his instrument rating three years ago,
and the two struck a solid friendship through their mutual love of
aviation.</TE>
<TE>   They have flown together recreationally many times, and both are
volunteer pilots for Angel Flight, a nonprofit organization that
arranges free private air transportation for medical patients who
cannot afford to fly commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Martins' friend and co-worker, Herbert Smole, 56, will accompany
the pair on their trip to New York. Smole, who recently moved to
Ventura County from Switzerland, also has a private pilot's license.
Smole's enthusiastic support of Martins' and Coolidge's efforts
earned him an invitation to join them on the trip to New York.</TE>
<TE>   The trio plan to make several stops on their cross-country flight.
On Thursday they will lay a wreath at the Somerset, Pa., crash site
of Flight 93, the airliner believed to have been headed to a target
in Washington, D.C., when passengers fought the hijackers. On Friday
they will fly to Fredrick, Md., for a Pentagon memorial and tour.
Then on Sept. 7, all the pilots will meet in Caldwell, N.J., for a
pilots' reception.</TE>
<TE>   The flag presentation ceremony will be held the next day aboard
the Intrepid, a World War II vessel that withstood seven bombings,
five kamikaze strikes and one torpedo hit. While the details of the
ceremony are still being worked out, event organizers are hoping New
York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be on hand to accept the state
flags.</TE>

<TE>   While the details of the ceremony are still being worked out,
event organizers are hoping New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
will be on hand to accept the state flags.</TE>
<TE>   Flight Across America founder Molly Peebles said the goal is to
restore public confidence in flying and pay tribute to victims of the
Sept. 11 attacks. Peebles, who quit her marketing job at Regal
Aviation in Washington state to run her new organization full time,
says her inspiration comes from aviation greats such as Charles
Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart and the Wright brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were people of vision and courage and possibility," Peebles
said. "With Flight Across America, this is a chance for us to tap
back into that spirit. We really want to highlight that flight is a
beautiful thing, that it epitomizes American freedom."</TE>
<TE>   While the pace of organizing a national event and conducting her
own cross-country flight can be wearing, Peebles said the e-mails she
receives each day from other pilots keep her going.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those participating in the ceremony have some link to the
Sept. 11 attacks, such as a New York Police Department sergeant who
worked at ground zero, a Florida pilot whose brother-in-law perished
in the World Trade Center collapse and a Colorado flag-bearer who was
furloughed from her job as an airline pilot in the wake of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Many are former military or commercial pilots. Martins and
Coolidge say meeting the other pilots will be the highlight of their
trip.</TE>
<TE>   At a ceremony this week, a representative of Gov. Gray Davis
presented Martins and Coolidge with a flag that had flown atop the
state Capitol during the nationwide day of remembrance last October.
The pair also received proclamations from the governor and Camarillo
Mayor Jan McDonald to present to New York officials at the Sept. 8
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   With only a few days left until they depart, Martins is getting
antsy. He and Coolidge have planned every detail of their flight.
Martins' two older sons, Nicholas, 13, and Christopher, 12, will take
a commercial flight to New York for the ceremony and then fly home
with their father. The boys, who are earning their Boy Scout aviation
merit badges, plan to record their experiences in journals.</TE>

<HD>The Slick Push for Business, Law Students</HD>
<DH>Education: Rival schools battle for top students they view
as investments. UC Berkeley will fly in any admitted law applicant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With glitzy campaigns that shower candidates with brochures, e-mail
and sales pitches on CD-ROM, business and law schools are competing
harder than ever for students.</LD>
<LD>   Among the strategies attracting attention is a program at Boalt
Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley, which for the second year this
spring offered to fly every admitted student to the Bay Area campus
for a visit. As a result, the rate at which top students accepted
admission offers from the school this year is up, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Competition for top graduate students in law and business has
accelerated over the last decade. Typical is the campaign waged by
Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, where prospective
students receive a series of e-mails, something of a slide show over
the Internet, complete with music and a cheering crowd. "It's hokey,
but it seems to work for us," Associate Dean Dan Nagy said.</LD>
<TE>   "What was a more gentle professional approach has become a more
aggressive, competitive approach," said Robert Saltzman, associate
dean of USC's law school.</TE>
<TE>   In stepping up recruitment efforts, many schools have had to
overcome the traditional reluctance of scholars to sell themselves,
said Joanne Telerico, associate dean of Chapman University School of
Law in Orange. "There's always a tension [between] a pure business
approach and the notion we're the Academy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important factor, deans say, is the magazine
ratings game. With annual rankings by U.S. News and World Report and
others, parents and students can quickly compare schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who says the rankings haven't affected things is giving
you a bunch of malarkey," Nagy said.</TE>
<TE>   While many undergraduate and graduate professional schools such as
medicine and engineering also compete for students, their efforts do
not approach the intensity of business and law, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald G. Ehrenberg, director of Cornell's Higher Education
Research Institute, said some schools look at these recruiting
efforts as an investment. The better the students, the more
successful they will be after graduation--and the more money they
will donate to the school later in life. "My sense is a lot of
concern of the business and law schools is concern about the long-run
financial revenue that will come to the institution," Ehrenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting is most intense a notch below the top-tier schools,
such as Yale, Harvard and Stanford, said John Kraft, dean of the
Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida and
president of the Assn. to Advance College Schools of Business, which
accredits such schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason for that is these schools aren't in the
traditional list," said Otis Baskin, former dean of Pepperdine
University's Graziadio Business School. "They aren't Harvard or
Wharton, but they're excellent schools competing to get the attention
of these top prospects."</TE>
<TE>   Law schools have long paid travel expenses for a few prospective
students who are especially desirable or who can't afford to visit.
Often those efforts are directed at minority students or those atop
the heap academically.</TE>
<TE>   But UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall appears to be the only law school in
the country offering to help subsidize visits for everyone it admits,
hoping a glimpse of the campus and the Bay Area will convince them
that it is the place to spend three years in law school. The subsidy
covers air fare but not hotels or meals.</TE>
<TE>   Boalt, ranked seventh in the nation in the latest U.S. News poll
on law schools, received about 7,000 applications this year. It
accepts about 800 students for its 270 slots, and nearly all have
offers from other law schools. So Boalt administrators, like those at
other schools, must persuade those students to turn down Stanford,
UCLA, Georgetown and other rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Boalt spent $31,000 in public funds on its fly-in program this
second year, and 123 students took Boalt's offer. Edward Tom, Boalt's
director of admissions, said enrollment among admitted students is up
from 31% in 1999 to 35% this year, much of which he attributes to the
visits.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found it's the best way to recruit anybody that's been
admitted," Tom said. "We're in sort of a war with the other top
schools.... For an applicant admitted to us and Chicago and Harvard
but who had never been to the Bay Area, we believe if we can
physically get them here, we have 90% of the battle won."</TE>
<TE>   Many law deans were astonished by Boalt's fly-in program but
agreed that visits are the top recruitment tool.</TE>
<TE>   Duke University School of Law in North Carolina annually flies in
the 25 or so students it wants most--those it offers full
scholarships, much like other schools. "If [Berkeley's program] is
successful, other law schools will think about it," said Dennis
Shields, the school's associate dean of admissions and financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   Others are considering it. UC Davis will probably start a similar
program next year, admissions director Sharon Pinkney said, and
Chapman University's fledgling law school may follow suit, mostly
with East Coast applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Like Boalt's fly-in program, much of the recruiting comes after
acceptance letters have gone out and students are deciding where to
go. "That's when we do a pretty good full-court press to make them
see the light," said Nagy of the Duke business school.</TE>
<TE>   Duke sends its admitted students flash e-mails, first a
congratulatory message, then a series on events at the school, from
the serious to the corny. "It's Marketing 101, but it seems to work
for us," Nagy said. Applications are up, and so is enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Many law schools now pay to promote themselves to professionals
and academics who influence the magazine rankings. Neil Cogan, dean
of the Whittier College of Law in Costa Mesa, said the number of
deans who show up at American Bar Assn. meetings has more than
doubled in 15 years, all touting their programs.</TE>
<TE>   Deans say they can't possibly know enough about the 182 accredited
law schools that magazines ask them to rank. So many schools spend up
to $200,000 a year on brochures and other public relations tools.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely promote ourselves," said Randolph Westerfield, dean
of USC's Marshall School of Business. "We want to tell our story of
scholarship and research."</TE>
<TE>   On the receiving end are those such as John Feerick, dean of
Fordham Law School in New York, who said, "I could fill a room in a
library every year based on all the communications that come in."</TE>

<HD>Bill OKs Freer Sale of Syringes</HD>
<DH>Health: Measure now goes to the governor. Sponsors say it
will cut disease; opponents say it condones drug use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature gave its final approval Friday to a measure that
would allow pharmacies to sell up to 30 syringes, or hypodermic
needles, to an adult without a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters say over-the-counter syringe sales would reduce the
spread of HIV and infectious hepatitis among drug users, saving
millions of dollars in medical costs.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the bill, mainly law enforcement groups, argue that
it would condone drug use and undermine the accountability provided
by the state's existing needle-exchange law.</LD>
<TE>   The bill now heads to Gov. Gray Davis. California is one of six
states that, with some exceptions, require a prescription to buy a
syringe.</TE>
<TE>   "This measure saves lives and dollars without any cost to
taxpayers," said its author, Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara.)</TE>
<TE>   About 50% of the 600,0000 hepatitis C cases and 19% of the more
than 124,000 HIV cases in California are related to needle-sharing,
according to the California Department of Health Services and the
American Journal of Public Health. The connection between injectable
drug use and HIV is especially strong for women and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Needle exchanges overseen by local governments offer people the
chance to trade dirty needles for new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacies would not take over that task under the bill, but would
be required to offer needle disposal options and provide information
about prevention and treatment of substance abuse, as well as a
toll-free number for help.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Assembly approved a bill that would allow the
state Department of Managed Health Care to regulate the types of
prescription drugs covered by health plans. Health maintenance
organizations would need approval from the department before they
could reject classes of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The department has been seeking that authority after state courts
ruled in two cases that regulators didn't have the authority to force
HMOs to cover the impotence drug Viagra or the obesity drug Xenical.</TE>
<TE>   The bill needs approval from the Senate, where it passed in a
different form. Daniel Zingale, director of Managed Health Care, said
the bill's importance goes beyond Viagra or Xenical.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurers have opposed the bill because they said it would
give regulators too much power.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we want to see people deprived of drugs they need,"
said Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn. of Health
Plans. "But we're just very concerned about the need to provide
employers and consumers with benefits packages that they can afford."</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped Boy Is Found Safe</HD>
<DH>Abduction: Authorities return Nicholas Farber, 9, to his
father, hours after issuing Amber alert. His mother and a man are
arrested at a camp near San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAMUL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Nicholas Michael Farber, the 9-year-old boy snatched from his Palm
Desert home this week in a violent predawn abduction, was discovered
unharmed Friday at a remote campsite east of San Diego, and his
troubled mother, suspected of orchestrating the abduction, was taken
into custody.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, officials had issued a so-called Amber alert,
which included a detailed description of the motor home that
investigators believed Nicholas was in, down to the kangaroo decals
on its sides. Hours later, a security ranger at Thousand Trails' Pio
Pico, a membership-only campsite and recreation park about 20 miles
east of San Diego, saw the RV.</LD>
<LD>   The ranger, Harold Stayton, said he watched a television news
program to confirm that the license plate on the motor home matched
the information contained in the Amber alert that flashed on freeway
signs across Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   When he found that it matched, he called authorities. Shortly
after noon, a phalanx of San Diego County sheriff's deputies and
California Highway Patrol officers surrounded the motor home with
guns drawn. After several requests--authorities heard "scurrying"
behind the motor home's drawn curtains, an official said--Nicholas'
mother, Debra Rose, 38, and an unidentified man emerged with their
hands raised.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, his hair dyed and cut to mask his identity, was inside,
"frazzled but otherwise OK," said a CHP officer, Steve Lopez. Before
agents could sweep Nicholas off to a waiting helicopter, the boy
begged officers not to separate him from his mother, Lopez said. His
mother, though she was handcuffed, tried to comfort him by stroking
his bangs and forehead before she was placed in the back of a
sheriff's van. Nicholas reminded officers to get his mother's
medicine before she was taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was flown in a helicopter to the Coachella Valley, where
he was quietly and privately reunited with his father at a Riverside
County sheriff's substation. The father, Michael Farber, 47, had been
beaten by the two gunmen who burst into his Palm Desert home around 2
a.m. Wednesday and took Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't just have good news--we have great news. We have
Nicholas. And he is safe," a beaming Riverside County Sheriff-elect
Bob Doyle said at a hastily called news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators surmised that Rose, fighting to keep custody of the
boy despite a recent arrest at her home in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
had embarked on a desperate flight--one that was doomed from the
start, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Some suspect she was en route to Mexico, but officials pointed out
that it would have been difficult at best for her to cross the border
in a motor home that police throughout the West were searching for.</TE>
<TE>   Even the popular campsite they chose, peppered with live oak and
cactus and part of the Thousand Trails park network, was particularly
crowded because of the Labor Day weekend, a ranger said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Doyle conceded that, before the ranger's tip, investigators
had been at a loss, though they had earlier spotted Rose's pickup
truck in a casino parking lot near Las Vegas, and though they had
been able to provide the public with a detailed description of the
motor home.</TE>
<TE>   "Seriously, we did not know where the motor home was," Doyle said.
"They could have been anywhere in the country. Up to 12:25 [Friday]
we did not know where the vehicle was."</TE>
<TE>   Stayton, 69, said his stomach was in knots when he realized he was
looking at the motor home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just doing my job," the ranger said. "The real hero is the
Amber alert."</TE>
<TE>   Rose will probably face both state and federal charges, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the kidnapping--the latest in a series of
dramatic child abductions that has alarmed parents nationwide--is not
over.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect the man taken into custody at the campsite is
one of the two gunmen who broke into the Farber home, but they
weren't sure Friday evening. And at least one of the two men who
carried out the abduction was still at large.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators continued searching for Rose's friend and former
Colorado Springs roommate, Carla Bender. Authorities had thought Rose
was traveling with Bender, who has also been labeled a suspect in the
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   "She has some culpability," Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents were also scouring a Laguna Niguel neighborhood Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rose's aunt, Julie Dohle, 60, lives in the neighborhood next door
to two sisters, one of whom owns a motor home similar to the one
seized Friday. One sister also has used the last
name--Benvenuto--that Rose used to register at the campsite. Property
records also show that the sisters have lived in Florida, and the
motor home has a Florida license plate.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was wearing only his briefs when he was kidnapped, but
Rose appeared to have clothes waiting for him after he was abducted,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He had been fed and "it doesn't appear that he was harmed or
neglected in any way," said Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Lisa
McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   After several other high-profile abductions, such as that of
Danielle van Dam in the San Diego area, ended in death, law
enforcement officials involved in the case described a feeling of
overwhelming joy when Nicholas was found.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a child abducted in a violent and dangerous way,
and then the child is found safe, that's just pure elation," said FBI
Special Agent Matt McLaughlin. "That's why we're in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Farber and Debra Rose were married in 1991 and divorced in
1995. For Rose, it was the third of five marriages and divorces.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas lived with his mother in Colorado until earlier this
month, when Rose violated a restraining order in a dispute involving
another ex-husband and was jailed briefly in El Paso County, Colo.
Michael Farber, who manages an upscale Mexican restaurant in Palm
Desert, received a phone call from an acquaintance, suggesting that
he go to Colorado to collect Nicholas. He did, and he received
temporary custody of the boy on Aug. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because he was unhappy with the conditions Nicholas was
living in, Michael Farber decided to seek full custody, his attorney
said this week. He and Rose had been assigned a Sept. 5 court date in
Orange County to debate the boy's future.</TE>
<TE>   In court documents, Michael Farber accused Rose of being a drug
addict and said she suffers from such severe migraine headaches that
she is unable to hold a job or care for the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Farber also wrote in court documents that Rose had become so
disruptive at times at Nicholas' school in Colorado that she had been
banned from the campus unless she restricted her visit to its
administrative offices.</TE>
<TE>   Rose's fourth husband, Stanley Rose, filed an affidavit in support
of Farber's petition for custody of Nicholas, saying that Debra Rose
is addicted to prescription drugs, including morphine. Stanley Rose,
saying he was concerned that Debra Rose is unstable, was granted a
permanent restraining order against her this week in Colorado
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   At the campsite Friday, families continued to arrive in
recreational vehicles even as investigators, ducking under yellow
crime scene tape, poked around the motor home and prepared to tow it
north to Riverside County. Campers were alternately captivated and
terrified at the sight.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never seen anything like this here," said Rosa Tejada, an
Ontario resident who visits several times a year. "This is very
scary. This is a family place and you think it's safe."</TE>
<TE>   The Amber alert issued for Nicholas on Friday provided motorists
and law enforcement officers with a detailed description of the
Bounder motor home that they suspected Rose and the child were in.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of two alerts Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The other was issued for 9-year-old Cierra Rose Walden, whose
mentally disturbed mother, Pamela Rose Walden, 50, apparently
abducted the girl Wednesday from a foster care facility in Madera,
Bakersfield police said.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield Det. Mary DeGeare said the girl was placed in foster
care after her mother told health officials she was communicating
with God through a computer chip placed in the girl's head. The
mother also insisted that someone was trying to kill the girl and
blame her.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, officials were looking for a blue 1999 Hyundai
Accent sedan with California license plate 4SHV526.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Friday evening that truckers who had seen the
Amber alert about Cierra on roadside signs spotted the Hyundai and
tried to surround it and stop. But the driver was able to get away.</TE>
<TE>   Amber alerts include more than flashing freeway signs advising
motorists to watch for a particular vehicle. The CHP also issues
advisories to the media for broadcast on radio and television and
provides detailed information for other law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen Amber alerts have been issued since Gov. Gray Davis
ordered the program to begin July 31.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an alert helped locate 10-year-old Nichole Taylor
Timmons, who was abducted from her Riverside bedroom and taken to
Nevada. Police arrested a 68-year-old man who had been her
baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said Friday they are careful not to overuse the
system. The Highway Patrol screens each request to ensure each case
meets certain criteria. The child, for example, must be in imminent
danger.</TE>

<HD>Budget Is Down to Wire</HD>
<DH>Laws: Farm labor act sent to Davis. Hundreds more bills
will pass or die in final frantic hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Increasingly desperate legislative leaders facing adjournment at
midnight tonight appeared near a budget deal Friday, while lawmakers
approved a bill overhauling California's landmark farm labor act.</LD>
<LD>   As demonstrators massed outside the Capitol and scores of
lobbyists roamed the hallways hoping to buttonhole lawmakers and make
last-minute appeals, legislators, their tempers sometimes flaring,
considered hundreds of measures in a final rush before the end of the
two-year legislative session.</LD>
<LD>   "This is slam-jam," said a frustrated Assemblyman Roy Ashburn
(R-Bakersfield), trying to keep up with the rush that comes at the
end of every session. "There is no time for anyone to fully
understand what these laws really mean. They gut and amend. Contents
of legislation are removed and replaced in the middle of the night,
rushed through meaningless hearings, and then appear out of nowhere
at the 11th hour."</LD>
<TE>   Among the scores of measures that won final approval was one by
Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) to permit pharmacists to sell
adults up to 30 syringes without a prescription in the hope of
curbing the spread of AIDS, and another that marks a significant
compromise between builders and trial lawyers over
construction-defect lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also sent to the governor legislation by Sen. Jim Costa
(D-Fresno) to place a $9-billion bond measure on the November 2004
ballot to finance the construction of a high-speed "bullet" train.
The system envisioned by the bill, SB 1856, would stretch from Los
Angeles to San Francisco and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Another measure, SB 1661 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
would provide paid family leave for Californians who want time off
from work to care for an ill family member. If Davis signs the
measure, employees would bear the cost of the program--about $2 to
$2.50 a month. One foe, Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), complained the
extra cost amounted to a new tax on jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Assembly's day was spent debating legislation aimed at
giving more rights to farm workers and allowing illegal immigrants to
obtain driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles) pushed the driver's license bill, SB 804, after Davis
refused to sign an earlier measure by Cedillo.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new bill, illegal immigrants could obtain licenses but
only if they were in the process of applying for citizenship, could
prove longtime residency and agree to criminal background checks in
this country and their country of origin. Davis insisted on those
provisions before he would sign the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven Republicans joined all 50 Assembly Democrats in voting for
the bill. The Senate was expected to vote on the measure today. But
some Republicans denounced it, among them Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy
(R-Monrovia), who warned that by granting "illegal aliens the right
to a driver's license, you've handed them the right to vote." Other
Republicans warned that the state could help terrorists blend into
society by allowing illegal immigrants to obtain licenses, a vital
form of identification.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not one scintilla of evidence to draw a connection
between terrorism and driver's licenses," Cedillo said, adding that
the bill would help authorities know who is in the country and would
make the roadways safer by requiring immigrants to pass driving tests
and have insurance. Senate concurrence was expected.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Capitol, the United Farm Workers union continued its
vigil on behalf of legislation to grant the union greater organizing
power. Lawmakers approved a bill earlier this month that would be the
first overhaul of California's Agriculture Labor Relations Act, a
1975 law approved when Davis was chief of staff to then-Gov. Jerry
Brown, an ally of UFW founder Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, trying to keep farmers in his camp as he faces reelection
in November, indicated he likely would veto it. When farm workers
amplified their campaign, the Democratic governor's aides sought a
compromise with Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco), who has been pushing the legislation on behalf of the
farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   As the Senate prepared to approve a revised bill Friday, Burton, a
frequent critic of the Democratic governor, chastised Davis for
failing to weigh in on the issue until recently, and then complaining
he hadn't been consulted. Burton noted he introduced the legislation
in February, and that it had not changed much since then.</TE>
<TE>   "If the governor was offended because we don't clear legislation
with him when we introduce it," Burton said in a floor speech that
elicited applause from legislative staffers, "I'm going to put a rule
in that every bill before it's introduced has to be vetted by the
governor.... If he could get away from his fund-raising activities to
pay attention, maybe then he will clear our bills and we can
introduce them."</TE>
<TE>   The veteran Senate leader concluded: "How dare he think that we
have to implement his vision. We have to do nothing but pass bills,
and if he'd come up with a budget, maybe we could pass that too."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean responded, "Mr. Burton is Mr.
Burton. What can we say?"</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed the bill on a 25-12 vote after the Assembly
approved it 49 to 25. Republicans, long aligned with farm interests,
voted in near unison against it. The bill, SB 1156, would allow the
union to turn to government mediators to resolve disputes over
contracts. Under the first bill, disputes would have been resolved by
binding arbitration. Farm groups saw little difference.</TE>
<TE>   "When the day is done, it's government-imposed contracts on
farmers and farm workers," said Carl Borden, California Farm Bureau
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Farm interests have donated $252,000 to Davis since the beginning
of August, when the issue neared final legislative resolution. But
Davis also hopes to maintain the support of Californians who care
about the plight of farm workers. Adding to the pressure, the UFW
plans to demonstrate outside Davis fund-raisers next week, and UFW
co-founder Dolores Huerta, 72, has said she was considering a public
fast if the governor vetoes the bill--not a pleasant prospect in
election season.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most striking demonstrations was organized by
representatives of regional centers that serve developmentally
disabled people. In a noontime rally, several hundred disabled people
encircled the Capitol, while their organizers urged lawmakers to
approve the state budget, now two months past the July 1 start of the
new fiscal year. Funding for the centers could become jeopardized if
no budget is in place by Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Capitol, the biggest fight was over the budget, with
much of the focus on a Democratic plan to end the impasse, but by
bypassing California's constitutional requirement that lawmakers
approve tax hikes by a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   Under the legislation headed for a vote in the Senate, Democrats
would allow Davis' finance director to raise the car tax by as much
as $7.2 billion over the next two years. Such a move would close much
of the $23.6-billion budget gap, and also would more than doubling
the annual cost motorists must pay to reregister their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an absolute outrage," Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) said.
"We are allowing unelected bureaucrats to raise taxes by billions."</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokeswoman said the governor has no position on the bill.
Republicans vowed to file a lawsuit if Davis signs it into law.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that, Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks
said he was "fairly close" to agreement with Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City), a sentiment that Wesson echoed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Davis' threat to call lawmakers into a special session
if they fail to approve the budget only served to raise some
legislators' hackles.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader Burton quipped that such a move would be welcome.
"Maybe then he'll become engaged," Burton said pointedly.</TE>
<TE>   Burton noted, however, that under state law, Davis does not need
to convene a special session to approve a budget. What's more, if
Davis were to make such a move, all budget actions taken in the
Legislature's regular session--including Senate approval of the
budget--would have to be done again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he knows that," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Jon Ortiz, Miguel Bustillo and Nancy Vogel
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Richard Lippold, 87; Created Abstract Sculpture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Lippold, creator of gigantic abstract metal sculptures that
sparkle and soar in prominent places--including Lincoln Center and
the Four Seasons restaurant in New York City and the Orange County
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where his red, gold and silver
"Fire Bird" flies through a glass facade, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Augusto Morselli, his companion of 28 years, said Friday that
Lippold died Aug. 22 of kidney failure at a hospital in Roslyn, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Morselli said that Lippold continued to draw new designs,
including one for a 200-foot-tall memorial to victims of the World
Trade Center disaster, until his final two-week hospitalization.</LD>
<TE>   "He saw his works as an affirmation of life," said Curtis L.
Carter, who as director of the Haggerty Museum of Art at Marquette
University in Lippold's native Milwaukee, curated a 1990
retrospective of the sculptor's work. "He thought that light and
space were the vocabulary of the 20th century artist. His work has a
sense of openness, and implies a kind of upward, celebratory
movement."</TE>
<TE>   Lippold wrote of finding inspiration in the technological
discoveries of his time: "Born into a place and an age in which space
and time are our principal companions, I feel it inevitable to love
them more than the solid materials with which my ancestors were
involved." But Carter, who became a close friend of the sculptor,
said he also spoke of German baroque church art and the land and sky
of the Midwest as important influences.</TE>
<TE>   Among Lippold's prominent works are "Orpheus and Apollo" (1961), a
190-foot-long piece suspended over the lobby at Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall, and the delicate, cloud-like 22-square-foot bronze
sculpture over the bar at the Four Seasons. "Ad Astra" (1976), a
115-foot-tall twin spire, stands outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.; "Flight" (1963) graces the lobby of what
is now the MetLife Building in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sun," commissioned by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art
in 1953, used nearly two miles of wire filled with 22-carat gold,
held together by 14,000 hand-welded joints. It took three years to
create and caused a sensation, although not all authorities were
impressed. "Not sculpture, but a kind of charade of sculpture which,
while hinting at vast conceptions, makes its points very much as
window decoration catches the eye," wrote critic Hilton Kramer in
Arts magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "If you opened Time or Newsweek or art magazines in the 1960s,
you'd find his name and a lot of publicity," said Carter. "His work
in recent times hasn't been as much in fashion as in the '60s and
'70s. But I would rank him as one of the major modern American
sculptors."</TE>
<TE>   "Fire Bird," from 1986, is an example of Lippold's combination of
gigantic scale and shining aspiration. It was commissioned by the
Orange County Performing Arts Center's leading benefactors, the
Segerstrom family, and named by the late Renee Segerstrom, who loved
Stravinsky's ballet, "The Firebird." Fabricated from three tons of
aluminum and stainless steel, supported by 490 cables, it is 60 feet
tall, 120 feet wide and 100 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "That sculpture has been such an incredible signature of this
place," said Jerry Mandel, president of the Orange County Performing
Arts Center. Mandel said that every few years, including a visit two
years ago, Lippold would come by "just to check it out" and make sure
it was being well-maintained. Other Lippold works in California
include "Flying Emeralds," in the lobby of San Diego's Emerald Plaza
office and hotel complex, and his 150-foot-tall altar canopy for St.
Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. Carter rates that 1970 assemblage
of thousands of polished aluminum prisms as perhaps Lippold's most
beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Lippold, the son of a mechanical engineer, studied industrial
design at the Art Institute of Chicago and had his own practice for
two years after graduating in 1937. He also studied piano and organ
and composed music in his spare time. He taught design at the
University of Michigan and married Louise Greuel, a dancer, in 1940.
His first sculpture, in 1942, was a collage of himself and his wife,
made of newspapers and baling wire retrieved from the Ann Arbor city
dump. They moved to New York City in 1944, she to study under Martha
Graham and Merce Cunningham, he to sculpt. He fell in with
avant-gardists such as Jasper Johns and John Cage--small wire
sculptures by Lippold adorned Cage's loft.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery shows through the late 1940s led to a 1950 commission from
architect Walter Gropius to make an outdoor sculpture at Harvard
University. Budding satirist Tom Lehrer lampooned the result, "World
Tree," in the Harvard Crimson: "Of all the thoughts of Mr.
Gropius/This cosmic hat rack is the dopius." But Lippold's career was
taking off, helped by his reputation as an artist who collaborated
well with architects.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Carter said, Lippold owned homes in Vermont and Italy,
as well as his main residence in Lattingtown, N.Y., where he kept a
collection of Rolls-Royces and built his own pipe organ.</TE>
<TE>   "He always said he wasn't interested in being well-known; what he
wanted was to have his work experienced," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most unknown great artist around. You ask around, 'Who's
Lippold?' and nobody knows, but that's what he wanted," said
Morselli. Morselli said it was Lippold's wish to be cremated and have
his remains launched into space: "He said, 'I came from space, I want
to go back to space.' In due time, we will honor his wish."</TE>
<TE>   Lippold's survivors also include his wife, two daughters and a
son, as well as seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 7, Aunt Are Rescued From Pool</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 7-year-old girl and her 45-year-old aunt were spotted on the bottom
of a swimming pool in Cypress Friday by a man who pulled them out and
revived them.</LD>
<LD>   The girl and her aunt, neither of whom could swim, had been in the
deep end of the pool when the aunt lost her grip on the wall,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent Wickander, who was at the community pool in the townhouse
complex with his son and mother, said he suddenly noticed a boy
looking into the water and crying.</LD>
<TE>   Wickander said he dove in and realized that two people were on the
pool bottom, both unconscious. He pulled the girl out and
administered CPR until she began to breathe, he said. He then dove
back in and pulled the woman out, and resuscitated her until
paramedics arrived. Both were admitted to Los Alamitos Medical
Center. "It was a scary thing," said Wickander, sounding shaken.
"Luckily, I had just taken a CPR class last Friday night."</TE>

<HD>Not All Praise New Focus in Black Churches</HD>
<DH>Neo-Pentecostalism Stirs Debate as It Builds
Mega-Congregations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN RIVERA</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Like a sea of humanity, nearly 20,000 swaying and singing worshipers
packed the Baltimore Convention Center, transforming the exhibition
hall into a tent revival.</LD>
<LD>   The organ pumped, an electric bass drove the gospel beat and a
massed choir raised its voices in praise. The churchgoers rose as
one, hands clapping, arms raised, some jumping up and down in an
ecstatic dance of the Holy Spirit.</LD>
<LD>   The recent national convention of the Full Gospel Baptist Church
Fellowship attracted Baptists, Methodists and others who a decade ago
would have worshiped in the confines of their own denominations. It
was a sign that a once-renegade movement in the African American
church called neo-Pentecostalism--which combines a powerful mix of
spirit-filled worship and a philosophy of black empowerment--has come
of age.</LD>
<TE>   Once confined to storefront sanctuaries and a handful of
Pentecostal denominations, it has been increasingly embraced by the
elite black churches of Baptists and Methodists. It is reviving
congregations and creating mega-churches.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pastor is truly anointed," Mashawn Phillips, 34, said of the
Rev. Jamal-Harrison Bryant, pastor of Empowerment Temple AME Church
in West Baltimore, which has grown from nothing to more than 2,500
members in two years. "I've done a 360-[degree] turnaround with
things that went on in my life, and it's all because of his teaching
and preaching."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars who study the black church consider neo-Pentecostalism
and the rise of the black mega-church the most significant trends in
decades.</TE>
<TE>   A conservative estimate is that one-third of mainline black
churches--Baptist and Methodist--have embraced neo-Pentecostalism;
that's about 5 million people. Perhaps more significant is that
nearly all the black mega-churches (those with more than 2,000
members) are neo-Pentecostal.</TE>
<TE>   But the success of neo-Pentecostalism has prompted debate about
the nature and mission of the black church.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime heroes of the civil rights movement express grave
concerns that church-based social activism is being cast aside by the
new emphasis on entertaining worship services, which they deride as
"shake and bake," and by the creation of a cult of celebrity
preachers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to survive in this country, the only way is
through church activism that identifies with the poor," said the Rev.
Vernon Dobson, pastor for more than 30 years of Union Baptist Church
in West Baltimore, which has a century-old tradition of civil rights
activism.</TE>
<TE>   "My fear is that somebody will get the wrong message and see
church as celebrating rather than serving," Dobson said. "Never shout
any higher than you can serve. Shout all you want. But let it be
measured by your service."</TE>
<TE>   Neo-Pentecostal services have many variations, but three important
elements are characteristic: professionally performed music that will
bring a congregation to its feet; dynamic and inspiring preaching;
and a sense of freedom in the congregation to respond as the spirit
moves--shouting, clapping, dancing, speaking in tongues, healing and
a sort of swoon known as being "slain in the spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "Miracles still happen," said Barbara Wiley, an elementary school
principal who attends a Full Gospel church in Erie, Pa. "People are
being healed; people are being delivered from oppression, drug abuse,
sickness--all by the power of the Holy Ghost."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of neo-Pentecostalism lie in the Pentecostal movement
that formed early in the last century, introduced to the world on a
large scale by the Azusa Street Revival, an interracial,
headline-grabbing religious phenomenon that began in 1906 in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the last century, Pentecostalism was limited to a
handful of denominations, such as the mostly white Assemblies of God
and the principally black Church of God in Christ, as well as smaller
storefront churches of the urban black underclass.</TE>
<TE>   But the more influential churches of the black middle class and
elites demurred, clinging to a more restrained style of worship
closer to that of the traditional European churches.</TE>
<TE>   Pentecostalism began creeping into mainline Protestant and
Catholic churches in the 1960s under a movement that described itself
as "Charismatic." About that time, John Bryant, a young black man who
grew up in West Baltimore's Bethel AME Church, became intrigued by
the possibilities of "spirited" worship. After a stint in the Peace
Corps in Africa and as a minister in Cambridge, Mass., Bryant came
home, where he took over the Bethel pulpit and established it as a
catalyst for black neo-Pentecostalism.</TE>
<TE>   "I began to minister and preach a combination of a spiritual
emphasis with a call to minister to the whole person, to speak on
issues of justice, liberation and empowerment," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   The people responded, and the congregation grew to 6,500 by the
time he was elected bishop in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Similar mega-church stories can be told in Los Angeles. One of
them, Faithful Central Bible Church, grew from 200 members to 10,000
in two decades under the leadership of Bishop Kenneth C. Ulmer--a
size so grand the church two years ago purchased the Forum for its
services.</TE>
<TE>   A national survey shows that fewer than 10% of black churches can
be considered activist congregations, frequently lobbying public
officials or participating in political advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to find there is a small cohort of activist churches at
the forefront of public policy where African American churches have
been involved," said the Rev. R. Drew Smith of Morehouse College in
Atlanta, director of a long-term study of black churches.</TE>
<TE>   Neo-Pentecostal pastors say their activism lies closer to home.
Using biblical imagery, they say the generation of civil rights
activists that had the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as their Moses was
led from the spiritual slavery of segregation and Jim Crow laws. But
this generation, they maintain, has entered into the promised land.</TE>
<TE>   "These are ministers who wish to close the gap between the two
kingdoms [of man and God] and establish God's kingdom to the best of
their ability here on Earth," said Robert L. Franklin, president of
Atlanta's Inter-Denominational Theological Center, a consortium of
six predominantly black seminaries. "The best antidote to poverty is
not to be a poor person."</TE>
<TE>   It comes down to a difference in philosophy and strategy. The
social-activist minister wants to transform the legal and economic
systems that keep poor people in poverty. The neo-Pentecostal
minister would rather transform the person.</TE>
<TE>   That theological vision is expressed in the community development
corporations set up by the neo-Pentecostal churches, which offer a
spectrum of social services and projects. The nonprofit agencies run
community outreach centers, offer alcohol and drug counseling, and
operate soup kitchens, clothing banks and job-training programs.
Others are building housing and helping members start small
businesses that provide jobs for their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Neo-Pentecostal ministers say they are neither social workers nor
social agitators, but simply Christians.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the frustration [the civil rights ministers] feel is we
are not making as many placards, we're not holding as many rallies,"
said the Rev. Dennis V. Proctor, pastor of Pennsylvania Avenue AME
Zion Church in West Baltimore. "But on the other hand, we're having
many more revivals and teaching sessions and seminars, trying to
equip our people to be family, to have sanctity of family, have
respect and reverence for the house of God and the people of God. And
the balance is absolutely necessary."</TE>

<HD>Fierce Battle Raging Over Privacy Bill</HD>
<DH>Finance: Measure would give consumers more power to keep
banks from sharing data. Moderate Democrats are again opposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For the second year in a row, moderate Democrats are blocking
landmark legislation that would give Californians more power to
prevent banks and other lending institutions from selling or sharing
their personal financial data, an increasingly widespread practice in
the Information Age.</LD>
<LD>   Despite numerous polls showing sky-high support for strong privacy
laws in the state, the Legislature has repeatedly failed to enact
such a measure amid furious lobbying by a well-heeled coalition of
banks, insurance firms, credit card companies and others that stand
to lose from it.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, state Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) has once
again succeeded in shepherding a privacy bill to the Assembly floor
this year with strong backing from consumer groups, labor unions and
AARP, among others. If approved, it would give California the
toughest financial privacy protections in the nation, surpassing a
populist law passed in North Dakota that was challenged by banks but
upheld by the state's voters.</LD>
<TE>   However, a moderate bloc of Assembly lawmakers known as the
Business Democrats is threatening to join Republicans to defeat the
measure, SB 773, which was expected to come to a vote late Friday
evening. The moderates had earlier floated a series of amendments
that would have significantly scaled back the scope of the bill, but
Speier rejected their changes.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from lawmakers worried about the political
repercussions of a "no" vote, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City) informed Democrats in a closed-door session Thursday night that
he was not even going to allow the bill to be debated on the floor.
The decision angered liberal Democrats and outraged consumer groups,
and Wesson later relented, saying Speier would have a chance to have
her bill heard before the legislative session ends today.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill is widely expected to fail, and when it does,
moderate Democrats are immediately expected to present their own, far
less comprehensive version of privacy legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Though the rival measure was still being put together late Friday
by Assemblyman John Dutra (D-Fremont) and others, it was immediately
assailed by state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and other supporters of the
Speier bill as little more than a political fig leaf. Lawmakers said
it has virtually no chance of clearing the state Senate, whose
leader, Democrat John Burton of San Francisco, strongly supports
Speier's effort.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the changes being pushed by the moderate Democrats came
directly from the office of Gov. Gray Davis, who said in his January
State of the State speech that he hoped to sign privacy legislation
this year. Administration officials insist that the governor, who has
sought to cultivate a business-friendly image and has accepted more
than $7 million in campaign contributions from insurers and banks
since taking office in 1999, is not trying to kill the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   But the officials have been calling legislators to urge them to
vote against the measure unless it is altered. And the
amendments--which would allow information sharing within large
corporations and their hundreds, sometimes thousands, of affiliates
without any customer consent--may, in fact, lead to the bill's
demise.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants the bill. But he wants some changes to it," said Davis
Press Secretary Steven Maviglio. "Even with the changes, it would be
by far the toughest privacy law in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Speier and Assemblyman Joe Nation (D-San Rafael), who were
carrying rival privacy measures earlier this year but recently joined
forces, said they would shelve their bill rather than have it watered
down against their will.</TE>
<TE>   Voters May Decide Issue</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to place pressure on Davis and lawmakers, supporters vow to
take the issue directly to voters next year if they fail once more in
the Legislature. Chris Larsen, the Northern California businessman
behind online lender E-Loan, has already pledged $1 million of his
personal fortune to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Every financial interest with a lobbyist in this country is in
this [Capitol] building in their tasseled loafers, doing their level
best to protect their interests," Speier said. "And their interests
are not equal to the consumer interest."</TE>
<TE>   Speier's bill, known as the Financial Information Privacy Act,
seeks to give consumers greater control over the personal data they
divulge to banks, lenders and others. Unbeknown to many consumers,
such information is now widely sold, traded and shared among
companies and their affiliates without customers' approval, and is
often used to shape the type of financial products and marketing
pitches they are offered.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting the Vulnerable</TE>
<TE>   Such so-called financial profiling greatly concerns consumer
groups, which contend that the information is often used in a
predatory, even discriminatory, manner.</TE>
<TE>   As an example of the practice, consumer activists point to a
recent court declaration from a worker at CitiFinancial, one of the
roughly 1,800 affiliates of Citigroup.</TE>
<TE>   "I and other employees would often determine how much insurance
could be sold to a borrower based on the borrower's occupation, race,
age and education level," said the former assistant manager, Gail
Kubiniec. "If someone appeared uneducated, inarticulate, was a
minority, or was particularly old or young, I would try to include
all the coverages CitiFinancial offered."</TE>
<TE>   Financial firms acknowledge that customers are concerned about
protecting their information. But they argue that a 1999 federal law
already gives the public a right to financial privacy, if they choose
to exercise it.</TE>
<TE>   That law, known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, requires banks and
others to send customers "opt out" notices informing them of their
right to prevent their information from being shared with
nonaffiliated firms.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to deal with a patchwork of state laws," said
Anissa Yates of the California Bankers Assn. "Our clients are
national and multinational banks, and they would have a hard time
reacting to these regulations. We also think that if California
passed this type of law, other states would follow with their own
laws."</TE>
<TE>   However, the federal law does not cover sharing or selling within
a large family of companies, which is the norm in the increasingly
consolidated financial world. And the notices that do have to be sent
are now so exceedingly technical that many consumer groups say they
are designed to be discarded by confused customers, who do not
realize they are throwing their right to financial privacy in the
wastebasket.</TE>
<TE>   Speier's bill would require far simpler notices, in large type,
that would directly explain the issue. Financial institutions that
wanted to share clients' information with affiliates would have to
send California customers straightforward opt-out notices. And firms
that wanted to share customers' information with third parties would
have to meet a tougher "opt-in" standard--obtaining written
permission.</TE>
<TE>   Speier's efforts to move a privacy bill to Davis' desk have been
the subject of one of the Capitol's fiercest fights in recent years.
It has repeatedly pitted her against an old antagonist, Democrat Lou
Papan of Millbrae, the chairman of the Assembly Banking Committee.
This spring, a Speier-backed candidate won a heated primary race to
succeed Papan, beating Papan's chosen successor--his daughter, Gina.</TE>
<TE>   Battle Is Rejoined</TE>
<TE>   When Speier faced off against Papan once again earlier this month,
Papan and other moderate Democrats joined with Republicans to insert
a hostile amendment into her bill to allow for information sharing
among affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   But Speier succeeded in removing the changes from her bill in the
Assembly Judiciary Committee before it moved to the full house.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the financial industry has waged a full-scale
assault to kill the measure. A report this week by watchdog group
Common Cause found that banks, insurers, lenders and others opposed
to it have spent more than $5.4 million in lobbying fees alone during
the current two-year legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   The figures, which do not include campaign contributions, were
only good through June and do not cover the last two months, which
have seen a virtual army of business lobbyists storm the hallways of
the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a graphic example of the influence of money on politics in
Sacramento," said Jim Knox, the director of California Common Cause.
"This bill has strong support among the public and is a top priority
of many consumer groups, yet it can't get through the Legislature."</TE>

<LD>Officials for ChevronTexaco made a $1-million donation Friday to
restore the approach to Yosemite National Park's most famous
waterfall.</LD>
<LD>   The 56-acre area at the base of Yosemite Falls is a mess of
crowded parking lots and worn paths. The approach has been severely
degraded by the more than one million people who visit annually,
according to the Yosemite Fund, the group leading the two-year,
$12.5-million renovation and restoration project.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Hansen, president of the Yosemite Fund, said plans include
taking out a parking lot, restoring stream banks and forest habitat,
adding wheelchair access to viewing areas, and installing signs to
highlight natural, Native American and pioneer history.</LD>

<LD>The atheist who won a court ruling to ban "under God" from the Pledge
of Allegiance is now going after taxpayer-funded chaplains in
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "If they want a pep talk, then go get a football coach ... but
stop getting chaplains and religious folks to come in," Michael
Newdow, a Sacramento lawyer and physician, said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a suit filed this week in Washington, Newdow said House and
Senate chaplain positions compromise a constitutional ban on
government-sponsored religion and religious requirements for public
servants.</LD>

<HD>Simon Due to Testify in S&amp;L Case 3 Days After Election</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. will not be called
to testify at a savings and loan trial in Washington until three days
after the Nov. 5 election, a federal judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling Thursday by Judge Emily C. Hewitt of the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims spares Simon from testifying during the crucial final
days of his campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Justice Department had said it might call Simon to the
stand Oct. 16, less than three weeks before the election.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's testimony would have drawn new attention to what Gov. Gray
Davis cites as one of his rival's biggest failures as an investment
banker. The trial stems from a lawsuit filed against the government
by Simon and other investors in the defunct Western Federal Savings
and Loan Assn. of Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was on Western Federal's board of directors for two years,
then served for the next two years on the board of its parent
company, Westfed Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators seized Western Federal in 1993 at a cost to taxpayers
of $122 million. The Simon investment group contends the seizure was
improper. Simon's family lost its $40-million investment in the
savings and loan and is trying to recoup the money.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Justice Department asked Hewitt for permission to
subpoena Simon to testify at the trial. But government lawyers also
offered to prepare written statements that "would eliminate the need
to call Mr. Simon" and another potential witness, Gerald Parsky,
President Bush's chief political operative in California. Parsky was
a Western Federal investor who sold his stake the year before
regulators seized the savings and loan.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing arguments on the matter Thursday, Hewitt revised the
trial schedule. From Sept. 17 to Oct. 25, she ruled, both sides will
present their cases, then the trial will conclude Nov. 8 with
testimony by Simon and Parsky.</TE>

<HD>Golf Courses Hope to Land Tiger's School</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Anaheim, Long Beach sites are in the running to
host golfer's center to teach the sport to needy kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tiger Woods Foundation plans to build an educational center where
children would take computer classes, be tutored and learn the finer
points of golf next to a course somewhere in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The $25-million center would be privately funded and is designed
to expose children from less-privileged backgrounds to a game often
associated with wealth and exclusivity.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to introduce the game of golf to kids who otherwise
wouldn't have an opportunity to play," said Greg McLaughlin,
executive director for the Los Alamitos-based foundation. "We hope
this would enhance a community and help a lot of kids."</LD>
<TE>   Among locations in the running for the Tiger Woods Learning Center
are the H.G. Dad Miller Golf Course in Anaheim and an unidentified
site in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of leasing the Dad Miller driving range to Woods'
foundation was raised by Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the Orange
County Board of Supervisors. The county flood control district owns
the driving range and a portion of the 18-hole course. The current
lease between the county and city expires Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Building the center in Anaheim would be fitting for Woods, who
attended Western High School in Anaheim and frequently played the Dad
Miller course in the mid-1990s. In the years since, he has become a
sports phenomenon, considered among the greatest athletes in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The center would be the foundation's first permanent location.
Woods, who lives in Orlando, Fla., has for years held traveling
clinics for inner-city kids--25 clinics in 25 cities as of this year.</TE>
<TE>   No deal has been struck with Anaheim, but negotiations are
continuing, said Tom Coad, Cynthia Coad's husband and advisor. "She's
given it her full support and cooperation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said her city's
staff also has been talking to the foundation about possible sites,
and "we're very excited about the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for a two-story, 30,000-square-foot learning center
next to a driving range and putting area. The first floor would house
a pro shop, administrative offices and classrooms. The second floor
would have computer classes with up to 200 terminals, a library and
space for tutoring in reading and writing.</TE>
<TE>   The center would be for children ages 8 to 17. Renowned golf
architect Tom Fazio would design its playing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   A sticking point has been finding an urban golf course with enough
land to accommodate the learning center without displacing golfers.
Woods wants the center built in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The range would be open to the public weekday mornings during the
school year. The center's students would have exclusive use in the
afternoons, weekends and during the summer.</TE>

<HD>Armenians Fight Plan for Israel Wall</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Court is asked to order that security barrier run
next to a 17th century sanctuary, not through it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades, Armenians around the world have maintained good
relations with both Israel and Palestinians, avoiding most of the
politics and bloodshed in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   But now, in churches and coffeehouses from Burbank to Bethlehem,
Armenian religious and political leaders have entered the conflict,
focusing on a small, but to many Armenians incalculably significant,
swath of land in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute stems from the Israeli army's recent bulldozing of
hundreds of olive trees in a 17th century Armenian sanctuary--part of
an effort to make way for a concrete barrier that will eventually
divide Israel and Palestinian-controlled lands on the West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Israel says the wall is intended to prevent Palestinian militants
from making violent forays into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   To Armenians, it is not the wall that is at issue, but its
location.</TE>
<TE>   The planned barrier, complete with barbed wire and motion
detectors, would run through the heart of the Baron Der sanctuary,
which is owned by the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and has been
used for centuries as a burial ground for Armenian monks. Armenians
have petitioned the Israel High Court of Justice to order that the
wall be placed on one side of the 36-acre property.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli diplomat said recently that a settlement could be
reached before the high court weighs in. "The church and the army are
trying to settle the matter," said Moshe Fox, minister for public
affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But as those discussions continue, Armenian
organizations--including many in Los Angeles County--have united to
protest the Israeli army's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "My office has been inundated with phone calls and inquiries from
our community, expressing strong concern over the seizure of these
historic Christian properties," said Peter J. Abajian, director of
the Western offices of the Armenian Assembly of America, based in
Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "While the Armenian community certainly understands the Israeli
position regarding security, it is unacceptable to accomplish this at
the expense of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Abajian said many Armenians had asked him to coordinate
demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   But he and leaders at the Armenian National Council in Glendale,
the Armenian Council of America in Pasadena and other groups,
conscious of diplomatic consequences, are pushing to delay any street
protests in the hope a settlement is reached.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctuary lies between a Palestinian-controlled area and the
outskirts of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The Armenian patriarch said the controversy began April 21, when
the Israeli army paved a military road passing through the Baron Der
property, dividing the parcel into two "useless plots."</TE>
<TE>   When paving the road, the army destroyed tombs and antiquities and
uprooted many olive trees that were hundreds of years old, according
to the patriarch.</TE>
<TE>   Oil from the trees was used to light lamps at the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   "We are upset, because the Baron Der property and the olive grove
has been ours since we purchased it in 1641," said Bishop Aris
Shirvanian, foreign relations director for the patriarchate. "We are
quite mad, because this has been done against our will and in
secret."</TE>
<TE>   Meirav Shahar, counsel of communications at the Israeli Consulate
in Los Angeles, said Israel acknowledges Armenian ownership of the
land and is not challenging it, "but we need access to this land on a
temporary basis."</TE>
<TE>   She would not define "temporary." One Israel official noted that a
security fence in the Gaza Strip is 8 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are building now is a buffer zone that we hope will stop
terrorism," said Shahar. "We would rather that it didn't go there
through Baron Der. But now it's up to the Supreme Court. We are
awaiting their decision. It is not something we are happy about."</TE>
<TE>   A letter from the half-million-member Armenian Church in America
to its parishioners urged them to get involved in the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "Israeli forces are seizing land owned by the Armenian
Patriarchate of Jerusalem, but it's not just a distant problem," said
the letter, written by Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, primate of the
Eastern Diocese. "It is a crisis that requires action of all
Armenians, especially those in America.... Together, with our prayers
and voices united, we will be able to bring attention to this little
plot of Armenian land caught in the midst of two warring factions."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Embassy official Fox, while defending the wall, said he
was concerned that the incident could damage relationships with
Armenians.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very cordial relations with the Armenians over there," he
said. "Nobody in Israel wants to create any damage to the
relationships with the Armenian church."</TE>
<TE>   Armenians in the Los Angeles area say they believe that, but many
are still angry.</TE>
<TE>   "The seizure of this land has aroused great emotions among all
Armenians," said Nahabed Melkonian, a Jerusalem-born writer and
political activist in Glendale. "We understand the importance
spiritual sites have for Israelis. We hope the Israelis will be
equally sensitive to the Armenian devotion to our centuries-old Baron
Der property as a spiritual site."</TE>

<HD>Bill Wassmuth, 61; Ex-Priest Led Anti-Hate Group, Helped to
Bankrupt Aryan Nations</HD>

<LD>Bill Wassmuth, a former priest who created one of the country's
leading anti-hate organizations after members of the Aryan Nations
firebombed his Idaho home, died Tuesday in Ellensburg, Wash. He was
61.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the
debilitating disorder commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Wassmuth was a Roman Catholic priest active in human rights
campaigns when his rectory-home and three other sites in Coeur
d'Alene, were bombed by members of the white supremacy group in 1986.
No one was injured, but four Aryan Nations members were convicted of
the crimes.</LD>
<TE>   Undaunted by the attack, Wassmuth helped found the Northwest
Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, a six-state network of groups
devoted to combating prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   He played a central role in turning public opinion against the
Aryan Nations, and was a key force behind the 2000 civil lawsuit that
bankrupted the group and closed its compound in the north Idaho
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "In my book, he's a true hero," said Morris Dees, the legendary
civil rights lawyer who tried the case.</TE>
<TE>   Wassmuth was raised on a farm in tiny Greencreek, Idaho, one of
nine children in a devout Catholic family. In Greencreek, he once
joked in an interview with the Seattle Times, "the only people of
color I ever saw ... were during the summer when the wheat farmers
got tanned from riding their tractors."</TE>
<TE>   He learned about tolerance and the difference one person can make
from his father, who managed a community skating rink. Some black
children assigned to work at a nearby Job Corps facility had tried to
skate at the rink, but the townspeople protested. The elder Wassmuth
stood up to friends and neighbors and refused to discriminate.</TE>
<TE>   Wassmuth entered seminary in eighth grade and was ordained in
1967, during the post-Vatican II era of reform in the Catholic
Church. After a period serving in church posts around Idaho and
working in religious education, he wound up in 1979 as parish priest
at St. Pius X Church in Coeur d'Alene.</TE>
<TE>   It was plain to his parishioners that he was no ordinary priest.
He was a bearded white guy who wore his hair Afro-style and favored
cowboy boots and a leather jacket over black robes and a clerical
collar. He rode a motorcycle and water-skied with the town's youths.</TE>
<TE>   Although not especially tall or physically commanding, he was a
charismatic speaker with a clear, resonant voice. His sermons
attracted new worshipers, doubling the size of the parish to 800.
Soon, a larger church was constructed, with mauve walls and pews
built in a semicircle around the altar.</TE>
<TE>   While Wassmuth was building his parish, Richard Butler, founder of
the Aryan Nations, was strengthening his operation. Based at a
20-acre compound near Hayden Lake that he established in the 1970s,
the former Southern California aerospace worker was recruiting
ex-felons to help him foment his war of hatred. He attracted
supporters who agreed with his views: that Jews were descended from
Satan, that blacks were soulless descendants of "mud people" and that
white women who married outside their race should die.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-'80s, Butler's adherents were being arrested for an
array of criminal activity--including bank robberies and
counterfeiting--committed to support his racist agenda.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Wassmuth became head of the Kootenai County Task Force on
Human Relations. Under his leadership, the low-profile group became a
visible force opposing the white supremacists. Butler began railing
against the task force--and Wassmuth in particular--after the group
rallied against an annual cross-burning at Butler's compound in July
1986.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, on Sept. 16, Wassmuth was talking on the
telephone when an explosion rocked the ranch-style house that served
as the St. Pius rectory and his home. He knew someone had just tried
to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never in my life had anyone be angry enough to raise a fist
at me, much less attempt to kill me," he told the Seattle Times
earlier this year. "I said to God: 'Now what?' "</TE>
<TE>   "Many felt it was a time to hide," said Marilyn Shuler, former
director of the Idaho Human Rights Commission, who had met Wassmuth a
few years earlier. "He just said, 'No, no, no. We are going to
continue to speak.' And he did that, even though he was targeted."</TE>
<TE>   Striking out against Wassmuth "was the worst mistake [the Aryan
Nations] ever made," said Tony Stewart, a political science professor
at North Idaho College in Coeur d'Alene and Wassmuth's longtime
friend. "Not only did it galvanize this community, but it made Bill
prominent around the country. He became a priest for ... people all
over the Northwest, promoting social justice."</TE>
<TE>   After the bombing, Wassmuth invited Dees to Coeur d'Alene to
discuss the possibility of legal action against the Aryan Nations.
Dees decided that he did not have enough evidence to link Butler to
the crime, but he stayed in touch with Wassmuth over the next dozen
years.</TE>
<TE>   Wassmuth remained head of the county task force until 1988, when
he made some dramatic personal changes. He left the priesthood and
married a local artist, Mary Frances Dondelinger. She survives him,
along with seven siblings.</TE>
<TE>   He also began discussions with other activists about the need for
a broader alliance to oppose organized bigotry. He moved to Seattle
and became the first director of the Northwest Coalition Against
Malicious Harassment. It later merged with another group, becoming
the Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity, covering Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a Native American woman named Victorian Keenan was
terrorized and her son, Jason, was beaten by Aryan Nations security
guards outside Butler's compound. They agreed to lend their names to
a lawsuit intended to put Butler and his group out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Dees came back to Idaho from his Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala. "It was the memory of Bill Wassmuth and his fight
over the years against Butler that made me want to come out there and
finish the fight," Dees told The Times this week. "I had tremendous
admiration for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Keenans' lawsuit contended that Butler and the Aryan Nations
showed negligence in hiring and training security guards. In late
2000, a jury awarded the Keenans $6.3 million, which was believed to
be the largest punitive damage award in Idaho history. Butler's
compound was dismantled and is being converted into a peace park.</TE>
<TE>   Wassmuth retired in 1999, planning to do some public speaking on
tolerance and renovate an old Victorian house he and his wife had
bought in Ellensburg. But the following year, he was diagnosed with
Lou Gehrig's disease, which atrophies the muscles and usually brings
death within two to five years.</TE>
<TE>   Although rapidly losing strength, he attended Butler's trial and
savored the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so pleased," Shuler said, "that justice was served."</TE>

<LD>This is the introduction of a column, analyzing game strategies,
scheduled for this space on Saturdays.</LD>
<LD>   Florida State almost lost its chance for an undefeated season,
and--who knows?--maybe the national championship, in its opening game
last Saturday at Kansas City against Iowa State.</LD>
<LD>   The game came down to the final play. Fortunately for the
Seminoles, Iowa State Coach Dan McCarney chose that play to
over-coach.</LD>
<TE>   With the Seminoles leading, 38-31, Iowa State had the ball at the
Florida State one-yard line with four seconds remaining. One play.
The pressure was on McCarney to call the right one.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding which player he wanted to handle the ball was easy
because Cyclone quarterback Seneca Wallace had been ripping through
the Florida State defense all game.</TE>
<TE>   In leading Iowa State back from a 24-0 deficit, Wallace had
accounted for three of the Cyclones' four touchdowns. Time after
time, he bought extra time against the Seminoles' pass rush to throw
for 313 yards, completing 22 of 33 passes, two of them for
touchdowns. He also was getting the job done on the ground, directing
the Cyclones' option attack to 130 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who needed the victory to pass
Bear Bryant for second place on the all-time victory list, couldn't
devise a way to stop Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace had set up the game's dramatic final play with a 20-yard
scramble and seemed primed to score again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give the ball to the best player on the team," said
McCarney, who was hoping to lead Iowa State to its first victory
against a ranked team in 29 games.</TE>
<TE>   But the play he chose for Wallace was not a good one.</TE>
<TE>   In college football, the hash marks are 53 feet 4 inches from the
sideline, compared to 60 feet in the pros. This gives college
offenses more working room inside the marks, but leaves them with a
very short side.</TE>
<TE>   With the ball on the right side of the field, McCarney figured
Florida State would stack up on the wide side to stop Wallace, who
had scored on an option run in a similar situation earlier in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   McCarney thought he would pull a fast one and run the same type
play--but to the short side of the field. Big mistake.</TE>
<TE>   What McCarney should have realized is that a player like Wallace
needs running room. McCarney ended up making Florida State's job
easier because the sideline serves as an extra defender on the short
side of the field.</TE>
<TE>   McCarney went with his main goal-line offense, which uses two
tight ends instead of two wide receivers. That allowed Bowden to go
with four linebackers, a strength for Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Another bad decision for Iowa State was to use motion before the
snap. The Cyclones had been putting their fullback, Joe Woodley, in
motion all game to get better blocking leverage on the option. Once
the Seminoles saw Woodley in the motion to the short side of the
field, the Cyclones were done.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wallace never had a chance. Florida State linebacker Jerel Hudson
and cornerback Kendyll Pope teamed to stuff him at the goal line to
end the game. Once Pope stepped up and forced Woodley to break
downfield, he took away Wallace's option to make a quick pitch to
tailback Hiawatha Rutland, who had rushed for 93 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw the fullback go in motion, I knew it was
coming," Hudson said. "They ran it before and I guess they thought
that they could run it again on us.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tried to stay behind the ball. I got him inside out.
Kendyll got him outside in and we got him stopped."</TE>
<TE>   If Wallace had scored, McCarney indicated he would have gone for a
two-point conversion rather than play for the tie. But that became a
moot point after Wallace was stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to see if [Wallace] could make something happen,"
McCarney said about his final play call. "If we had to do it again,
we'd still put the ball in his hands."</TE>
<TE>   And, assuming McCarney had learned from his mistake, he would call
the play to the wide side of the field.</TE>

<LD>As the Angels and Baltimore Orioles played at Edison Field last
night, a group of shirtless fans stood up in the right-field
bleachers, then turned their backs on the game and delivered a
message via body paint: "KCAL PUT US ON TV."</LD>
<LD>   See? All it took was all-night bargaining sessions and
unprecedented concessions by the Major League Baseball Players Assn.
to return Angel fans to their normal state.</LD>
<LD>   One night after they staged a mini-uprising, pelting the field and
players with everything from bottles to slices of pizza and tossing
foul balls back toward the mound, the crowd was back to its polite,
tepid ways.</LD>
<TE>   They cheered warmly for the Angels. They applauded Angel starter
Mickey Callaway for his efforts after Geronimo Gil broke up his
no-hitter with one out in the sixth inning. They roared for Adam
Kennedy's diving stop of a grounder in the ninth. They kept every
ball hit into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   No baseball, no peace was the message they seemed to send with
their rambunctious actions Thursday night. And their wishes were
granted. A collective bargaining agreement was reached early Friday
morning without an interruption in play, and by Friday evening 29,959
forgiving fans returned to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Just happy to be here," one woman said on the way in.</TE>
<TE>   The fans clapped along with the beat to "Car Wash." One held up a
sign that said "Play Ball," with a picture of Gene Autry.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, tonight they came out and supported us," Angel
shortstop David Eckstein said. "We couldn't ask for a better crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans are important. Without them, we wouldn't have a game.
They make the game. [Thursday night], they were just showing their
disapproval of what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   The fans had their moment. They were heard. The owners and players
acknowledged them, even if they didn't embrace them.</TE>
<TE>   I still think the negotiators acted in their own interests, more
concerned with potential economic repercussions and tattered
reputations than the best interests of the fans. But at least they
realized that the fans weren't ready to tolerate another work
stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   The talking heads can go away now. Time for a roll call of people
who received way too much exposure with all of the strike talk. We'll
call it the Zimba-list, named in honor of economics professor Andrew
Zimbalist, who was quoted about 100 times in the last two weeks: Bud
Selig, Don Fehr, Rob Manfred, Bob DuPuy, Gene</TE>
<TE>   Orza, John Moag and Dean Bonham.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Paul Lo Duca and Scott Schoeneweis? You are now dismissed.
I'll never blast players who go out of their way to accommodate the
media's demand for information, but Lo Duca and Schoeneweis turned
out to be too talkative for their own good. They're baseball players,
not spokesmen, and the fact that they were forced to assume those
extra duties was just another negative byproduct of the near-strike.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, Dodger catcher and player representative, angered Dodger
management with his hard-line stance earlier in the week, then got in
hot water with his union comrades when he blabbed inaccurate
information about the proposed drug-testing plan. Schoeneweis, the
Angel pitcher and player representative, prompted a flurry furious
calls and e-mails to the Angels after he questioned the fans' class
and likened their behavior to 4-year-olds for the actions Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis backtracked and apologized for those comments Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The fans booed him when he entered the game in relief in the
eighth inning. They booed even louder when he threw a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   It showed the fans aren't simply going to pretend no ill will has
accumulated.</TE>
<TE>   There need to be more apologies and even more gestures of
appreciation to everyone who has stuck with a game that produced
nothing but bad news since the last car came to a halt in the Arizona
Diamondbacks' victory parade last November.</TE>
<TE>   From contraction to steroids to labor strife, I can't think of a
worse 10-month stretch of news for a sport that didn't actually go
through a work stoppage. You think, maybe, the sport might actually
start promoting its players instead of going out of its way to
disparage them? You think the players can make sure they show
gratitude toward the fans who allow them to enjoy their plush
lifestyles?</TE>
<TE>   The last time baseball gave us a story we could embrace was when
the Yankees staged their late-inning World Series dramatics just a
subway ride away from the still-smoldering ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the Sept. 11 attacks, we've craved things that were
normal. This nice summer evening in Orange County featured a
medium-sized, well-behaved crowd at an Angel game.</TE>
<TE>   What could be more normal than that?</TE>

<LD>The Oakland Athletics extended the majors' longest winning streak in
25 years to 16 games Friday night, beating the Minnesota Twins, 4-2,
at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Chavez drove home an unearned run to break a fifth-inning tie
and the A's followed a 10-0 road trip by moving within one victory of
the franchise-record 17-game streak by the 1931 Philadelphia A's.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland's accomplishments have been largely overshadowed by
baseball's labor strife, but the A's remained red-hot through all the
uncertainty. They've won more games in a row than any team since
1977, when the Kansas City Royals won 16 consecutive.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time in 12 games, however, the A's didn't score at
least six runs to back their powerful starting rotation. Ray Durham
led off the game with a homer, doubled twice and kept two rallies
alive with hits.</TE>
<TE>   The A's starters have won 15 of the 16 games in the streak, but
Tim Hudson (12-9) was shaky in Oakland's first home game since Aug.
18.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Seattle 1--Raul Ibanez drove in four runs with a
pair of doubles against his former team, leading Paul Byrd and the
Royals over the faltering Mariners, 5-1, at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 45,260 watched the third-place Mariners lose for the
fifth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez, who left Seattle and signed with the Royals as a minor
league free agent after the 2000 season, doubled to center field in
the first and fifth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 15, Cleveland 5--Brian Daubach and Trot Nixon each homered
and drove in four runs and Derek Lowe earned his 18th win at
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox showed no effects of a long day of uncertain travel,
scoring 11 runs over the first three innings. Cliff Floyd drove in
two runs for the Red Sox, who gathered at Fenway Park in Boston at
4:30 a.m. PDT for the trip to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Not knowing if there would be a strike, they waited five hours
before boarding a bus to the airport, then taking off. They got to
their hotel in Cleveland at 12:30 p.m. PDT and went right to Jacobs
Field, but did not take batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Toronto 7--Alfonso Soriano homered twice, leading
substitute starter Jeff Weaver and the Yankees at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano, attempting to become the first second baseman in major
league history to have a 40-40 season, hit his 33rd and 34th homers.
He stole his 36th base in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano hit a two-run homer off Pete Walker (7-4) in the second
inning and a solo homer off Scott Cassidy in the ninth. Weaver (8-11)
filled in for Andy Pettitte, who had a stiff back.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Detroit 3--Dan Wright (10-11) yielded only three hits
in seven innings and Josh Paul hit a tiebreaking single in the
seventh to help the White Sox at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Crede led off the seventh with a double and was sacrificed to
third by Royce Clayton. Paul's single drove in Crede and gave Chicago
a 3-2 lead. Aaron Rowand's single gave the White Sox an insurance
run.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 9, Texas 7--Aubrey Huff and Steve Cox each homered and
had three hits as the Devil Rays recovered after wasting a five-run
lead at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 48th homer and Rafael
Palmeiro hit his 485th career home run. The consecutive shots in the
fourth inning for Rangers tied the score, 7-7.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If baseball's new collective bargaining agreement is truly
"historic," as Commissioner Bud Selig called it Friday, it won't be
because it was the first achieved without a work stoppage but because
it helped address the competitive and revenue disparities that Selig
has continually cited for depriving too many cities of "faith and
hope."</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the agreement, achieved by negotiators for the
owners and players after a series of around-the-clock bargaining
sessions over a 48-hour period that took the sides into Friday's
union strike date, Selig said he was confident the contract would
"significantly contribute" to the restoration of competitive balance
and represented the culmination, as Paul McCartney wrote, "of a long
and winding road."</LD>
<LD>   Time, of course, will determine the agreement's impact on
competitive balance, but it certainly represents a breakthrough in
the often rancorous labor relations between owners and players and
represents a recognition by both sides that the game would have been
seriously damaged by a ninth work stoppage in 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the shuttle diplomacy, as the negotiators hiked through the
rain between the union and Major League Baseball offices, frequently
surrounded by reporters and cameramen blocking their progress, there
were the 11th-hour trade-offs typical of any meaningful bargaining
process and concessions on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Selig could ultimately say that the agreement included most of the
components recommended by his economic study committee two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it provides the salary restraints that most owners
considered an imperative complement to the restoration of competitive
balance is another issue that will be determined by time.</TE>
<TE>   But union counsel Gene Orza didn't seem concerned that the
combination of a payroll tax and increased revenue sharing--both
burdens falling on the high-revenue clubs that drive the salary
market--will impede signings.</TE>
<TE>   "If the salary growth declines," he said, "it's generally only
partly the result of a bargaining agreement. The principal cause is
generally the result of a slowdown in the overall economy.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as clubs aren't acting collusively, and there isn't the
artificial restraint of a cap, we've accepted the ups and downs of
the market for what they are."</TE>
<TE>   Here are some highlights of the long road to Friday's agreement:</TE>
<TE>   * It was only two days after a memorable World Series that Selig
shattered the Game 7 glow by announcing that the owners intended to
eliminate two teams, later determined to be Minnesota and Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The contraction scenario clouded the off-season and was eventually
foiled by the courts and a union grievance. Now, as part of the give
and take of the bargaining process, Selig has agreed not to contract
until 2007.</TE>
<TE>   The commitment figures to keep the Twins in Minnesota and could
find the Expos moving to Washington, although the suit recently filed
by the Expos' former minority partners against Selig and former Expo
owner Jeffrey Loria for mail and wire fraud could be a complication.</TE>
<TE>   * The union swallowed its objection to a payroll tax that it long
considered tantamount to a cap and ultimately agreed to thresholds of
$117 million next year, $120.5 million in 2004, $128 million in 2005
and $136.5 million in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   All payroll--based on 40-man rosters and benefit payments--above
those thresholds will be taxed at rates ranging from 17.5% to 40%
depending on the number of times a team goes over the threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Although four teams--the New York Yankees, Texas, Dodgers and
Boston--would be taxed based on the $117 million threshold and their
2002 payrolls, it's ultimately aimed at reining in the Yankees, whose
2002 payroll for tax purposes is $171 million.</TE>
<TE>   The union didn't want a tax in the fourth and final year of the
contract but accepted it in trade-off for the agreement's usual
expiration date moving from Oct. 31 to Dec. 19. This protects the
postseason free-agent class of 2006 from a lockout in event of a
labor dispute and was the last serious hurdle in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   * About $169 million is being transferred from the high-revenue
clubs to the lower-revenue clubs this season. That amount will
increase to $258 million when fully implemented in the third and
fourth years of the new agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Clubs will share 34% of their local revenue after ballpark
expenses, and the revenue-sharing pool will be increased by an annual
$72.2-million contribution from the central fund, a depository for
national TV and licensing income. The owners agreed to a phase-in of
that amount, a concept that almost disrupted the entire negotiations
when first proposed by the union, in return for the union, which had
initially proposed sharing $235 million, agreeing to the $258 million
figure and a higher annual phase-in.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, under their new tax and revenue-sharing
responsibilities, will have to pay between $50 million and $55
million next year, about double their current burden. Club officials
refused to say whether they are still considering a suit against
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   * In addition to the previously announced agreements on minimum
salary and steroid testing, the sides have agreed to the concept of a
worldwide draft of amateur players and will continue to discuss the
format, including the number of rounds. The union has proposed 20 and
the owners 38, according to Orza, who said it hasn't been determined
whether the draft will be implemented next June or in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Among the members of management's negotiating committee was
Baltimore owner Peter Angelos, who was asked if he thought the
agreement would help restore competitive balance, an issue that makes
union officials bristle because they consider competitiveness more a
test of good management than lack of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a contest. It's a game," Angelos said. "If there
isn't competition, the people you're trying to reach lose interest. I
think this is a good step in the direction [of restoring balance]."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the next step wasn't on a picket line, it probably
should be considered a very good step.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Mickey Is No Mouse</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Callaway takes no-hitter into sixth inning, beats
Orioles, 6-2, for first major league victory since 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A strike that killed their playoff chances might have seemed
appropriate for the Angels, given their long and sad history of
postseason misfortune.</LD>
<LD>   But with the threat of a strike removed by Friday morning's
agreement between players and owners, the Angels returned to the
field to write what they hope will be a new and happier chapter.</LD>
<LD>   Angel starter Mickey Callaway carried a no-hitter into the sixth
inning and his teammates pounded Baltimore Oriole pitching for 10
hits, carrying the Angels to a 6-2 rout before an energetic crowd of
29,959 at Edison Field. Callaway, called up from triple-A Salt Lake
City, pitched six-plus innings to earn his second major league
victory and his first since June 12, 1999, when he was with the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a while in between," he said, "and it's not going to be
that long in between for the next one."</TE>
<TE>   The victory, coupled with the Seattle Mariners' 5-1 loss to Kansas
City, boosted the Angels' lead in the wild card race to 1 1/2 games
over Seattle. They remained 3 1/2 games behind the AL West-leading
Oakland A's, who won their 16th consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway, a 27-year-old right-hander, made his first start Aug. 25
at Boston. On Friday, he held the Orioles without a hit until
Geronimo Gil's one-out single to right in the sixth. He pitched into
the seventh before being relieved by Brendan Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt great those first five innings," Callaway said. "I got a
little bit away from the gameplan. I've got to get us further into
the game and rest the bullpen. I have to learn off of this."</TE>
<TE>   While Oriole starter Jason Johnson (4-11) struggled, the Angels
capitalized on his unsteadiness for two runs in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein led off with a single to center. He was out at
second on Darin Erstad's fielder's choice grounder, but Johnson
walked Orlando Palmeiro to put runners on first and second. Garret
Anderson was retired on a fly to left, but Troy Glaus walked to load
the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio drove in the first run with a roller to third,
handcuffing Oriole third baseman Tony Batista and leaving him with no
play. Spiezio's infield hit loaded the bases again, leaving Johnson
no place to put Brad Fullmer after hitting the Angel designated
hitter on the right leg with a pitch. That brought Palmeiro home from
third. Bengie Molina ended the inning by lofting a fly to right.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added two runs in the fourth, to the delight of a crowd
that seemed to have forgiven and forgotten all its angst over a
possible strike.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer began the flurry with an infield hit. He was running when
Molina lined a single to right-center and was able to reach third. He
scored on Adam Kennedy's single to right, which moved Molina to
second.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein followed with his third hit of the game, a single to left
that loaded the bases. Erstad hit a comebacker to the mound, but
Johnson's only play was to first, allowing Molina to score.</TE>
<TE>   After Palmeiro hit a fly to center, the Orioles intentionally
walked Anderson. The strategy worked when Glaus hit a harmless fly to
center.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad padded the lead to 5-0 in the sixth inning, with a one-out
homer to right, his ninth home run of the season.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Callaway had lost his no-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the sixth, Gil lined a single down the right-field
line. The fans, in tribute and consolation, gave Callaway warm
applause that grew into a mini-standing ovation. They were deflated
when Mike Bordick launched a 1-and-2 pitch into the left-field seats
for his sixth home run of the season, but exulted after Callaway
struck out Melvin Mora and got Jerry Hairston to hit a comebacker to
the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Callaway has earned the right to
stay in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he's pitching and where we are in the season, he's going
to get that opportunity," Scioscia said. "If he keeps pitching the
way he's been, he's going to give us a big lift."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis came on in the eighth with two runners on base
and earned his first major league save.</TE>

<LD>Although outfielder Tim Salmon said he hasn't set a timetable for his
return to the lineup, Manager Mike Scioscia said he hopes Salmon's
sore left hand will be strong enough for Salmon to play next week.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon was put on the 15-day disabled list Aug. 22--retroactive to
Aug. 14--because of discomfort and swelling that resulted from being
hit on the hand by a pitch.</LD>
<LD>   X-rays and an MRI exam found no skeletal or muscular damage, and
the injury was diagnosed as a bruise.</LD>
<TE>   "Best-case scenario is midweek," Scioscia said. "But he still has
a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon hit off a tee Thursday and followed that Friday by taking
an estimated 30 or 40 swings off soft-toss pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good," said Salmon, who was batting .339 with four home
runs and 20 runs batted in since the All-Star break. "That was the
key, swinging [Thursday] and today and seeing how I felt. I felt good
so we upped it and I took more swings. [Today] we'll be waiting to
see what it feels like.</TE>
<TE>   "Mick [Mickey Hatcher, the Angels' hitting coach] had to cut me
off. That's the big thing, to build on what I did and not to get
carried away."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who wore an ice pack on his hand after hitting Thursday,
said he will be guided by how his hand feels in deciding when he can
return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Dennis Cook, trying to rehabilitate a shoulder injury
instead of undergoing surgery, made his second rehabilitation
appearance. He was the loser in the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes'
8-5 loss to the Lancaster JetHawks on Thursday, giving up four runs
and four hits in one inning.</TE>

game? And the last to win?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spare us: Does anyone else feel used after baseball owners and the
players' union sucked up so much ink just to reach a deal at the 11th
hour?</TE>
<TE>   The whole process was tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   It was all those signs--you know the ones, "Strike and we're
out"--that wore on Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   "The signs became a nightly feature of every sports broadcast
('And here's a fan holding up a sign telling everyone what he thinks
about a potential work stoppage.'), as well as a staple of every
morning front sports page. ('And here's a fan holding up a sign
telling everyone what he thinks about a potential work stoppage.')"</TE>
<TE>   Put 'em away till the next collective bargaining agreement is
about to expire.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What he meant was ... : Mike Ditka remains a big believer in Ricky
Williams, but he got tangled up in his own words as he expressed
support for the mildly eccentric Miami running back, who has
struggled with social anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "I do a lot of work with kids with Down syndrome," Ditka told the
Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. "I have no problem talking with people
who are at a 3-or 4-year-old level. I know what they're saying comes
from the heart. I think Ricky is a lot like that. He speaks from his
heart."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm. Not too sure where Ditka speaks from.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Cool" vs. cool: From Suzanne Lenglen's leg-baring outfits to Anne
White's long white body suit to Serena Williams' short black cat
suit, going untraditional is a time-honored tradition in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   But as Andre Agassi tells Bud Collins in the Boston Globe, it's
important to keep function in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, in retrospect, the jean shorts were probably too heavy, too
hot," Agassi said. "But tennis was considered such an elite game that
I wanted to show you could set your own style."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but if it doesn't feel good, don't wear it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lou Holtz. The Irish lost to Michigan at home,
24-23, in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Davie won his first game in 1997, a 17-13 victory over George
O'Leary's Georgia Tech team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Baseball might have lost something even by reaching a
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The early leader in an America Online poll about reaction to a
strike being averted: "Don't care; NFL is around the corner."</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took Oklahoma much longer than expected to resemble a No. 1 team.</LD>
<LD>   The Sooners, who moved into a tie with Miami this week atop the
Associated Press top 25 poll, led only 3-0 at halftime before beating
Tulsa, 37-0, Friday night at Tulsa, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   Senior tailback Quentin Griffin gained a career-high 237 yards and
freshman Kejuan Jones had 70 yards and two short touchdown runs. But
dropped passes, three turnovers deep in Tulsa territory and other
mistakes made for a sloppy opener.</LD>
<TE>   "There were a lot of good parts of this game and we're going to
focus on those," Coach Bob Stoops said. "We had four third-down drops
inside the 25-yard line, and we have three turnovers inside the 20.
If we don't have those, we're in great shape."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners struggled early against a team that gave up 35 points
and 447 yards a game while going 1-10 a year ago. But Oklahoma
eventually hammered Tulsa on runs up the middle and finished with 378
yards rushing.</TE>

<TE>   Mississippi State quarterback Kevin Fant won't play today against
No. 15 Oregon after the NCAA denied the university's appeal of his
one-game suspension. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal of
Tupelo, citing unnamed sources, reported that Fant's suspension
resulted from a violation involving the purchase of tires, and that
Mississippi State reported the infraction in April. Freshman Kyle
York is the Bulldogs' expected starter.... Stanford quarterback Chris
Lewis will be suspended for the Cardinal's season opener at Boston
College on Sept. 7 because of an NCAA rule violation. The school
provided no details of Lewis' infraction. Lewis, a junior from Long
Beach Poly High, has played in 16 games, making seven starts.
Freshman Kyle Matter will start in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Miami starting cornerback Kelly Jennings will be sidelined for the
Hurricanes' opener today against Florida A&amp;M because of an injured
right thumb. Junior Al Marshall will start. The injury is the second
to Miami's secondary in a week. Senior safety James Scott is out at
least three weeks after breaking a wrist.... Florida State cornerback
Leroy Smith was suspended for today's game against Virginia after
violating an unspecified training rule, Coach Bobby Bowden said....
Tommy Grady of Huntington Beach Edison High, considered the No. 1
quarterback in Southern California, has committed to Oklahoma. He
passed for 2,790 yards and 33 touchdowns as a junior.</TE>

<HD>In the End, Contraction Became Part of Equation</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Selig said it wasn't a negotiating ploy, but
final deal includes agreement not to eliminate teams through 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In November, after major league owners voted to eliminate two teams,
Commissioner Bud Selig dismissed any connection between a plan that
would eliminate 50 jobs for players and looming negotiations with the
players' union.</LD>
<LD>   "It is absolutely not a negotiating ploy," Selig said that day.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, however, the so-called contraction plan did become
part of the negotiations. As part of a labor agreement in which the
players' union made concessions regarding revenue sharing and a
payroll tax, owners agreed not to eliminate any teams through the
term of the agreement, which extends through 2006.</LD>
<TE>   Major league owners appear likely to approve the first franchise
move since 1971, when the Washington Senators moved to Texas and
became the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos, a franchise bought back by the owners after
the contraction plan collapsed last winter, could move to the
Washington area as soon as next year.</TE>
<TE>   And the Minnesota Twins, the other team targeted for elimination
last winter, can continue a summer of celebration. The Twins enjoy
the largest lead of any team in the American League, appear destined
for their first playoff appearance in 11 years and now are guaranteed
to survive four more years, a respite that could allow the team to
secure a new owner and a new ballpark. Owner Carl Pohlad, who has put
the Twins up for sale, had volunteered for contraction last winter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very positive day," said Clark Griffith, son of former
Twin owner Calvin Griffith. "We were within an eyelash of
disappearing as a baseball community.</TE>
<TE>   "This at least solidifies us for the next four years. I think
we're in pretty good shape for the long term."</TE>
<TE>   With a labor agreement in place, one designed to aid markets such
as Minnesota that generate comparatively less revenue, Griffith said
he plans to pursue a bid for the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   With no buyers for the Expos, owners pooled $120 million last
winter to buy the team from Jeffrey Loria, in a deal that allowed
Loria to buy the Florida Marlins. There still are no buyers for the
Expos, but two groups in the Washington area jockeyed for position
upon announcement of the labor agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Selig reiterated that owners would not move any teams
until after reaching a new labor agreement but called Washington the
"prime candidate" for any team that would relocate. When owners
assumed control of the Expos, chief operating officer Bob DuPuy said
he would be "shocked if it went on more than one year."</TE>
<TE>   One group wants to buy the Expos and move them within the
boundaries of Washington; another proposes a purchase and move to
Northern Virginia. Neither group has finalized a plan for financing
and construction of a new stadium, leading Winston Lord, executive
director of the D.C. group, to suggest that owners might wait until
2004 before putting a team in the Washington area. Still, a team
could play in a temporary home at RFK Stadium next season.</TE>
<TE>   And, with relocation an option, a top official in the Northern
Virginia group suggested that efforts to lure a team might not be
limited to the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there's Montreal, but you look at Miami and Tampa and
the Oakland problem, with them so close to San Francisco," said Gabe
Paul Jr., executive director of the Virginia Baseball Stadium
Authority. "Now that contraction is off the table, the only way
you're going to satisfy and rectify those situations may be to move a
club."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos' situation is complicated by a federal lawsuit that
charges Selig, Loria and others with conspiring to eliminate the
franchise. The lawyers representing the defendants, former minority
partners in the franchise, have indicated they would seek an
injunction barring any attempt to move the team. In addition,
Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos believes that any franchise
moving to the Washington area would harm the Orioles, and owners
widely believe they would have to compensate Angelos in order for him
to withdraw his opposition to such a move.</TE>
<TE>   The two Washington area groups could bid as much as $300 million
for the Expos. So, after compensating Angelos and splitting the costs
of buying and running the Expos, owners could split a nice profit on
their investment, a little more revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you're forced into an investment," former Angel
President Richard Brown said. "In this case, it will turn out to be a
very good investment."</TE>

<HD>Dalby Dies in Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Dalby, a fixture on the Oakland and then Los Angeles Raiders for
14 seasons, died in a single-car accident Friday in Dana Point, where
he lived. He was 51.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Dalby's death may be alcohol-related.</LD>
<LD>   Dalby, who played from 1972 through '85, was only the second
starting center in franchise history, replacing Hall of Fame player
Jim Otto, who retired in 1974. Dalby also was a member of the UCLA
Hall of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred about 12:45 p.m. in a parking lot at
Palisades Drive and Pacific Coast Highway, said Orange County Sheriff
spokesman Jim Amormino. He said witnesses noticed that Dalby was
sitting in his parked van for some time before the car accelerated
forward and struck a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics had to extract Dalby from his car. He was transported
to San Clemente Hospital, where he was pronounced dead within an
hour, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death and an investigation are pending, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Raider officials were informed of Dalby's death late Friday
afternoon and were in the process of informing their former and
current players.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good friend, and a lot of players stayed in touch with
him constantly," Raider executive Bruce Allen said. "The organization
has lost a good friend."</TE>
<TE>   Dalby maintained a Raider Web site and frequently attended games.
In the final season of his playing career, he was replaced by Don
Mosebar, a first-round pick from USC who switched from guard to
center in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave and I were always very close," said Otto, who is suffering
from prostate cancer. "I just talked to him on Tuesday. He said,
'I'll just come up [to Auburn] and spend some time with you.' You
just wonder what's going to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mosebar: "Dave gave everything he had for the team. He helped
me out--some young guy who came in to take his job--but he never
worried about that. He was all about the team."</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Starter gives up five runs in three innings and
his replacement fares no better in 8-4 loss to Astros.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The euphoria of a new labor agreement and the knowledge that the plug
wouldn't be pulled from the Dodgers' promising season quickly gave
way to the frustration of an 8-4 loss to the Houston Astros on Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd of 30,046 in Minute Maid Park watched the Astros rock
Dodger starter Andy Ashby for five runs in three innings and rough up
reliever Kevin Brown for three runs--two of them on homers--in three
innings, as Houston pulled within five games of the Dodgers in the
National League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   Right-hander Wade Miller (12-3) faced the minimum 18 batters in
the first six innings before giving up four runs in the
seventh--three on Adrian Beltre's homer to left--but three Astro
relievers shut down the Dodgers over the final 2 2/3 innings, and the
surging Astros improved to 31-17 since the All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   The pitching tandems of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, Greg
Maddux and Tom Glavine, Pedro Martinez and Derek Lowe, receive more
publicity, but Houston's duo of Miller and Roy Oswalt are 59-20 since
the beginning of 2001, second only to Schilling and Johnson (83-20).</TE>
<TE>   "We dug a hole for ourselves early in the game that was too deep
to get out of," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. " ... The Astros have
rectified themselves since the first half, and they're going to be a
force down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ashby (9-10) considered Friday "a positive; the main thing
is we're playing baseball and we have a [labor agreement]," he
couldn't feel good about his performance.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander had gone 2-1 with a 1.76 earned-run average in
his previous six starts, but he collapsed during a four-run third, in
which he gave up an RBI single to Lance Berkman, a sacrifice fly to
Daryle Ward and a two-run triple to Orlando Merced.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't give us a chance to win--I didn't do my job," Ashby
said. "Basically, I couldn't throw a strike. I was behind in the
count all the time, and when you get behind, you have to nibble. It's
not easy to pitch that way, especially here, against a good lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Biggio homered off Brown in the fifth before the Dodgers
rallied for four runs in the seventh to trim the lead to 6-4. But
Jose Vizcaino homered off Brown to open the bottom of the seventh,
and Merced added a sacrifice fly to extend Houston's lead to 8-4.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers awoke Friday morning still not knowing whether they'd
be going on strike or to Minute Maid Park, but when catcher Paul Lo
Duca, the team's union representative, called to inform teammates of
the labor agreement, a collective sigh of relief filtered through
their hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I can finally exhale, for myself, for this team, and for the
fans," Dodger center fielder Dave Roberts said. "We've been trying to
focus on baseball and not the labor situation, but I was wondering if
[Wednesday's game] was going to be our last of the season.... I'm a
fan, too, and I didn't want the game to be tainted in any way."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers haven't reached the playoffs since 1996 and haven't
won a postseason game since 1988, and Tracy acknowledged he would
have been "devastated" had there been a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have been hurt for the game, for this team, and for the
fans," Tracy said. "How would you bring closure to an uncertainty?
It's hard to do. It's easy to say you would have done this or that
[had there not been a strike], but that's just an opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Added Lo Duca: "With the position we're in, no one wants to see
the season end. We got a deal done. I don't want to get into who's
happy, who's not happy, I'm just glad we're going to finish the
season, we're going to be playing on Sept. 11, and for all the kids
who are going to get called up [Sunday]. It's a great feeling for
them."</TE>
<TE>   As the team's player representative, Lo Duca has participated in
daily conference calls for the last week and has been the focus of
intense media grilling as Friday's strike deadline neared.</TE>
<TE>   Though he claimed his union responsibilities weren't a burden, Lo
Duca acknowledged "it's just great to get this off the table and get
the focus back onto the field." After hitting .326 in the first half,
Lo Duca is batting .206 since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a blue-collar gamer, and he's had a lot on his plate--maybe
an excess--but he's never used that as an excuse," Tracy said.
"Offensively, he hasn't been where he likes to be, but when he goes
behind the plate, no one on that pitcher's mound has suffered. That's
when it would have become an issue for me."</TE>

<HD>Cora Makes Return to Starting Lineup</HD>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Shortstop Alex Cora, who was hospitalized for a night after suffering
a moderate concussion during a head-first dive into the knee of
Arizona shortstop Tony Womack on Monday night, returned to the
starting lineup Friday night against the Astros.</LD>
<LD>   Cora, who missed games Tuesday and Wednesday night, was cleared
Friday by trainers who conducted hand-eye coordination tests after
various exercises, such as running, riding a stationary bike, taking
batting practice and fielding ground balls. Cora's headaches were
gone, and the soreness in his upper back had dissipated.</LD>
<LD>   After being knocked unconscious for 30-45 seconds by his collision
with Womack, Cora said he will try to avoid sliding head-first.</LD>
<TE>   "But I have to go with my instincts," Cora said. "I want to slide
feet-first, but when things are moving fast, we'll see. Hopefully I
can be a little more cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Cora didn't get a chance to test his approach Friday night; he
flied out twice and grounded out in three plate appearances in the
Dodgers' 8-4 loss to Houston. But he did cleanly field the two
grounders hit to him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speedy center fielder Wilkin Ruan, utility player Joe Thurston and
catcher David Ross are expected to be among the first wave of
call-ups from triple-A Las Vegas when rosters can be expanded Sunday.
One of three left-handed relievers--Mike Magnante, Jeff Williams or
Victor Alvarez--will also be recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, reliever Giovanni Carrara and infielder
Jeff Reboulet will be activated off the disabled list Sunday, and
reliever Kevin Beirne will join the Dodgers on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   When Las Vegas has completed the triple-A playoffs, the two other
left-handed relievers from the Magnante/Williams/Alvarez trio, and
possibly outfielder Chin-Feng Chen, are expected to be recalled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said there was no need for any kind of pre-game
speech to re-focus the Dodgers after a week of speculation about the
labor situation. "They know where they're at, as evidenced by the way
they've played the last 20 games, and when you're playing the clubs
we're playing for the last 29 games, you don't need any motivation.
This is a special opportunity for all of us." ... Struggling
left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii, whose spot in the rotation was skipped
this weekend, was in the bullpen Friday night and will be there again
tonight. Tracy said he would only be used in relief in case of
emergency. Ishii is scheduled to start Tuesday night against Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Seeks Some Payback Against MetroStars</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A., which lost, 5-0, to New York/New Jersey in
June, hopes to turn things around.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cobi Jones swears he wasn't one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Galaxy captain was at Edison Field on Thursday night.
But he was there in an official capacity, throwing out the ceremonial
first pitch--a sinker, he said--before the Angel game and doing a
live television interview that lasted half an inning.</LD>
<LD>   But Jones insists he took his baseball and Angel jersey home that
evening and didn't join the irate crowd, which, fearing it was
witnessing the last game before a players' strike, littered the field
with baseballs, beach balls and toilet paper to protest a possible
work stoppage.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball's strike was averted, but who knows what Galaxy fans will
shower the Rose Bowl field with tonight if the Galaxy gets thumped
again by New York/New Jersey, as it was on June 15 at the
Meadowlands, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   Not to alarm anyone, but they are giving out Galaxy lunch boxes
tonight, which is somewhat fitting since the Galaxy has adopted a
lunch-box mentality since the worst loss in team history.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows that this is a match that we need to come out and
get a little bit of revenge for the way we were pretty much beat up
on last time," said Jones, who missed that game while at the World
Cup with the U.S. national team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's ready and prepared for this game."</TE>
<TE>   A week between matches will do that.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy is coming off a stretch during which it played six
games in 18 days, three consecutive weeks of Wednesday matches
followed by Saturday matches.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sigi Schmid gave his team two days off this week as a
respite before the season's stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about how the week has gone and I think the guys are
rested and ready to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They'd better be. Against the MetroStars, the Galaxy will face
arguably Major League Soccer's most intimidating forward in the
6-foot-4, 210-pound Mamadou "Big Mama" Diallo.</TE>
<TE>   Diallo, who joined the Metro- Stars after a May 24 trade with New
England, burned the Galaxy defense for four goals in June, the second
time he had scored four in a game against the Galaxy. In seven
matches against the Galaxy, Diallo has 11 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having played in only 19 games this season, Diallo has 11
goals, six behind the 17 scored by New England's Taylor Twellman in
24 games, and Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz in 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schmid said, the Galaxy is in a different place today.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a better rhythm at this point of the year than we were
the last time we played New York," he said. "But anytime you take a
loss like that, it's something you remember. It's on our players'
minds and it's something we need to make up for."</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The last few days, the American players have been searching for "the
juice," the extra energy and drive they need to push them through a
talented field at the 2002 World Basketball Championships.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night, in a tight first-round game against Germany, they
got what they needed from Paul Pierce.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Celtic guard took command with a spectacular third
quarter and propelled the United States to a 104-87 victory that was
not nearly as comfortable as the final score might suggest.</LD>
<TE>   The victory keeps the U.S. unbeaten (2-0) in this tournament
entering tonight's game against China and its NBA-bound center, Yao
Ming.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Germany (1-1) that appeared to have the upper hand
coming out of halftime, pushing to a slight lead while the
Americans--now undefeated in 55 games when NBA players face
international competition--looked occasionally lax for a second
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little frustrated," Pierce said. "I had to be a little
bit more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   That meant going to the basket instead of settling for outside
shots. And that led to his impressive run.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of his team-high 26 points were scored in those few
minutes. He began with a lay-up here, a free throw there. Then came
the fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   With 2.5 seconds remaining in that third quarter, he scored a
lay-up, made a free throw, grabbed a tipped inbound pass and heaved
in a 30-foot shot at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Those six points put the U.S. ahead by 10 and took the fight out
of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "They made plays when it counted," German guard Marko Pesic said.
"That is the difference between good teams and very good teams."</TE>
<TE>   Up to that point, Germany had stayed close thanks mainly to Dirk
Nowitzki, who had a game-high 34 points and 10 rebounds. But his best
play came early.</TE>
<TE>   After halftime, Nowitzki appeared tired and harassed by increased
pressure from U.S. forward Ben Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   The stage was set for Pierce's explosion and a fourth-quarter
blowout.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody just had the juice," he said. "I'm sorry it took us so
long to get it."</TE>

<LD>It has been almost seven years since a horse not trained by Bob
Baffert has won the Del Mar Futurity, and the trainer has been nearly
as dominant in the $250,000 Del Mar Debutante, which will be run for
the 52nd time today.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert has won the Debutante, the last Grade I race of the Del
Mar meet, five of the last seven years and four of the last five.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Catarina has a chance to continue Baffert's good fortune in
the seven-furlong Debutante as she makes her stakes debut against
eight other 2-year-old fillies.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who have never won the Debutante,
the daughter of Unbridled stamped herself one of the better members
of her class with an eight-length maiden win here Aug. 11. She has
trained well since the race and looks capable of making the jump from
the maiden ranks to Grade I winner, as Habibti did for Baffert in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The most accomplished member of the field is the unbeaten
Buffythecenterfold, a Capote filly trained by Mel Stute and named for
former Playboy centerfold Buffy Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   Buffythecenterfold is three for three with two stakes wins--in the
Landaluce at Hollywood Park and the local Sorrento.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Zavata will be heavily favored to win for the
fourth time in five starts in today's $200,000 Hopeful Stakes at
Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   The Hopeful is a Grade I at seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. Headed for his first Del Mar riding
title since 1991, Valenzuela won four races Thursday and two Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's fifth at Sacramento. The six
maiden fillies and mares are 0 for 79.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the eighth using Santa Catarina
and Sea Jewel on top, those two plus Miss Houdini in the two hole and
all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Friday): Previous day/meet total: 3/68. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $15.80/$400.80. Total money bet: $560.</TE>

<LD>Now that the baseball strike is no longer an issue, I find myself
completely ambivalent about the situation. There was a time when I
would have felt anger about the way the players and owners have
turned this sport into a business. Of course, I'm not going to kid
myself: All sporting franchises are businesses. The atmosphere and
mind-set of the entire league have shifted from a sport to a job.</LD>
<LD>   If I want to see a baseball game, I'll catch a college, high
school, or minor league game--games where money is not the motivator,
games where the players still like playing for the sake of baseball
itself.</LD>

<TE>   No matter how much motivated by greed and general selfishness, we
should still recognize that averting the work stoppage was no small
accomplishment. There are no losers but only the fans, the vendors
and the various related workers who are all winners.</TE>

represent, we should congratulate them for seeing the bigger picture
and finally learning how to act on it.</TE>

<TE>   Not to rain on anyone's victory parade, but the problem is that
this compromise, like all the others before it, is only a temporary
fix. Eventually, whether it's in four or five years or 20, the
players' union will keep demanding more and more until the owners
will have no choice but to shut the game down for as long as it takes
to finally break the union and start from scratch. It's inevitable.</TE>

<LD>What a wonderful "Chicken" story [Bill Plaschke, Aug. 25]. In a
subtle way it says so much about the pending baseball strike. The
fabric of the game has changed so much that having fun at the
ballpark and entertaining the fans is no longer a priority for the
players or management. I, for one, miss the Chicken and what he and
the other mascots gave to the game. It sure was more enjoyable than
today's "wave" or watching a beach ball in the stands!</LD>

<LD>While I found Paul Lo Duca's comments as silly as any regarding the
possible strike, there is no cause to paint him with the same brush
as that hypocrite Brett Butler.</LD>
<LD>   While constantly spouting off about what a great Christian he was,
Butler led the charge against Mike Busch, who did nothing more than
report to work when his employer told him to. Lest we forget, Busch
had a young wife and child and if he did not report to spring
training in 1995, the Dodgers had threatened to cut him. Busch was a
minor leaguer and the union was not going to help him if he was out
of work. Not only did Butler speak out against Busch, Butler's wife
led the charge to ostracize Busch's wife from the family section at
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   In the end it was Busch himself who saved Butler from the ire of
the fans by agreeing to appear with him at a press conference to bury
the hatchet. Lo Duca may be silly, but he's no Brett Butler.</LD>

<LD>Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this alarming pattern
developing in Trojan football? Every year for the last four or five
years, this program seems to lead the NCAA in injured players. This
starts in training camp and continues all season long. When checking
the pregame report, USC's injury list is always three times longer
than the opponent's.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some questions that need answers: Do you have a
year-round training table for your players? Do they work out all year
long in a state-of-the-art facility on campus? Are your fitness
coaches and instructors as qualified as they should be?</LD>
<LD>   All the major universities with successful football programs
insist on training and facilities of this type. Given the cost of
your tuition, and the wealth of most of your alumni, this should be
available to your athletes.</LD>

complaining about protecting quarterbacks. The next time anyone wants
to complain, have him first stand still with arms up in the air and
then have someone who outweighs him by at least 125 pounds and
wearing much more padding come charging at him and pile-drive him
into the ground. Then ask him again.</TE>

<HD>Kid Has a Real Ball at Dodger Game</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Sunday evening Dodger game against Atlanta, my 12-year-old son
and I sat in the first row of the loge near first base. He waited
anxiously and hoped against all odds that a foul ball would come his
way.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of the eighth inning, as the Braves were coming back
into their dugout, first baseman Julio Franco looked up into the
crowd and saw my son Justin waving frantically for the ball. He
smiled and tossed the ball directly to my son. Immediately, a nearby
teenager jumped at the ball and knocked it out of my son's glove. It
fell below to a man in the field-level seats. My son, crushed,
crumpled in his seat and began to cry. Fans around us encouraged him
with "There will be others" and "It was the other kid's fault." That
did little to console him.</LD>
<LD>   I then watched as a fan below made his way to the man with the
ball and talked to him for several minutes, gesturing up at my son.
The gentleman, as he was certainly so, looked up and tossed it to
Justin. That not only made his day, but restored my faith in
humanity.</LD>
<TE>   As the fans cheered the gentleman for his kindness, I waved and
mouthed the words "Thank you" to both men below. My endless thanks to
Julio Franco and the two gentlemen for making a 12-year-old boy
happy.</TE>

<LD>I was born and raised in Southern California and always took pride in
our local teams. I grew up admiring such Dodger greats as Don
Drysdale, Steve Garvey, Steve Yeager and Davey Lopes. I sat in front
of the TV watching Kareem, Coop and Magic. I knew the sounds of Vin
Scully and Chick Hearn as well as my dad's voice.</LD>
<LD>   But there was one problem. As hard as I tried, and as much as I
wanted, I could never, ever be like any of those players. After all,
I was a girl.</LD>
<LD>   I couldn't be a Dodger. I couldn't be a Laker. Instead, I had to
sit and dream that someday my brother would grow up to be like them.
Except for tennis (and a little golf) there was not much for a young
female athlete to look forward to. But that is changing. Now I can
take my daughter and son to a Sparks' game, or watch them on TV, and
be proud that Los Angeles not only has a women's professional
basketball team, but indeed has the best women's basketball team
around.</LD>
<TE>   My daughter can watch Lisa Leslie do her magic in the post and be
able to say, "I want to be like her someday." And why shouldn't she
be able to? Why isn't she able to more often?</TE>
<TE>   Because there are still men out there whose thinking is so shallow
that they cannot stand the thought of admitting that women are great
athletes. There are people out there more concerned with ridiculing
the game than promoting it.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on you, Mr. Simers. I plan to be at that parade; that is, if
people like you don't find a way to bring in the rain.</TE>

<LD>   Angry U.S. Sprinters Blame Coach for Disqualification</LD>
<LD>   Confusion about the schedule for the second-round heats in the 100
meters caused two U.S. sprinters, Rey Robinson and Eddie Hart, to be
disqualified. The only U.S. sprinter who did arrive in time for the
start, Robert Taylor, finished second and advanced. He also would
finish second the next day in the final, behind Soviet Valery Borzov.</LD>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Borzov almost missed the second round. He too had
been given the wrong start time. But he had remained at the stadium
instead of returning to the village and was sleeping when he heard
the sprinters being called for his heat.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz Makes It Five for Five With Two Races to Go</TE>
<TE>   With two events remaining, Mark Spitz had already become the
greatest swimmer in Olympic history. He won his third individual
event, the 100-meter butterfly, and set his third world record. He
also anchored the winning 800-freestyle relay team to a world record.
His fifth gold medal was a record for a swimmer in a single Olympics,
passing the four won by the United States' Don Schollander in 1964.
Spitz's seven gold medals, including the two he won in relays in '68,
tied the all-time Olympic record for swimmers set by Johnny
Weismuller.</TE>

<KH>BASEBALL'S 11TH-HOUR LABOR SETTLEMENT / Ross Newhan ON
BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>On With the Show</HD>
<DH>Dollars Didn't Get in Way of Sense</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When it came down to it, when Bud Selig and Don Fehr and their
negotiating staffs stared into the abyss of baseball's ninth work
stoppage in 30 years, it wasn't so much that either side blinked.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't so much that either side finally pushed the other over
the edge in the holy pursuit of total victory.</LD>
<LD>   This was sweeter than that, better for both, and certainly more
productive for the game and their relationship.</LD>
<TE>   How it plays out, what impact the new bargaining agreement has on
competitive balance and the payroll structure remains to be seen, but
give them credit.</TE>
<TE>   Peace is better than war, and in avoiding a work stoppage for the
first time in baseball's combustible labor history, both sides
identified the risks in doing otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The result was that a union conditioned to sweeping the owners
agreed to the types of concessions, some larger than others, it would
have considered--and still does to an extent--abhorrent in other
years.</TE>
<TE>   And the owners, who normally pursue total victory, only to
capitulate at the 11th hour and be left with nothing, accepted
incremental gains they can possibly build on in the next
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We had significant differences, no question about it," union
counsel Gene Orza said, "but the key to this negotiation was that the
clubs did not approach it with a provocative or authoritative stance.
That was the one distinguishing feature."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but more than the men who set the tone and did the
negotiating, the strike-day settlement might have germinated in the
accompanying environment.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the events surrounding these negotiations that
conspired to produce--or at least contribute to--the changes in
attitude and atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   A work stoppage by millionaire players and billionaire owners amid
the nation's reeling economy and attendance already down 6%?</TE>
<TE>   Empty ballparks devoid of patriotic ceremonies on Sept. 11?</TE>
<TE>   Ballplayers averaging $2.4 million having garbage and coins thrown
at them, poster boys for greed?</TE>
<TE>   Look, no one should be so naive as to think money didn't play into
the urgency to reach a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   There was pressure from those bankers wanting loans repaid, and
pressure from Fox concerned about postseason ad revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Players would have lost about $335 million in salaries if the
final 431 games had been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Owners might have lost $400 million in attendance and other
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Dollars, as always, were a compelling factor, but so was sense,
for a change.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why they kept talking even after Fehr had had a
couple of his usual verbal blowups at the table--union lawyers Steve
Fehr, Michael Weiner and Orza were pivotal in keeping the process
moving.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why nobody quit even when the talks were causing
sleepless nights and prompting lead management lawyer Rob Manfred to
run to catch the last train from Grand Central long after midnight so
that he could get home for a quick shower and be back in time for a
breakfast of bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different world than it was in 1994," veteran player agent
Tom Reich said, referring to the 232-day work stoppage of 1994-95.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who couldn't see the risk of permanent damage with
another stoppage had to be blind, and neither side was.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be complimented. They knew the sport couldn't afford,
maybe even survive, another shutdown and they negotiated a very
even-handed agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Even-handed is one thing. Meaningful is another.</TE>
<TE>   Of the major components, only time will determine if the increase
in revenue sharing will be employed by recipient owners to close the
competitive gap or wind up in their pockets, as that dole often has,
to enhance their balance sheets and franchise values. The payroll tax
and steroid testing could be similar illusions.</TE>
<TE>   The tax is strictly what it is designed to be, a Yankee tax.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, only New York figures to be consistently
penalized.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the big spenders have already begun policing themselves.
Cleveland and Baltimore have already cut back, and Texas and the
Dodgers may be next.</TE>
<TE>   Steroid testing is strictly window dressing aimed at appeasing
fans. It has no teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Random testing kicks in only if survey testing shows that more
than 5% of the players are using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   The first survey test is in the spring. Players know it's coming
and would have to be suffering from too many beanings to be on a
spring cycle.</TE>
<TE>   This was all about public relations for both sides, and the
owners, who like to market bulked-up athletes hitting the ball out of
the park, didn't want it any more than the union did.</TE>
<TE>   With all of that, the union can boast that it negotiated on issues
it has previously refused to negotiate. That allowed Selig to emerge
with almost all of the components recommended two years ago by his
economic study committee and to announce for the cameras that the
agreement should significantly contribute to restoring competitive
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-line owners may believe it doesn't go far enough and isn't
tough enough on salary growth, but it figures to be ratified, and it
figures to contribute to a measure of previously missing stability.</TE>
<TE>   If it also should not have come down to the 11th hour and a union
strike date, the commissioner has to stand before the cameras on that
as well.</TE>
<TE>   If he had not called off secret negotiations with the union during
mid-summer of 2001, withdrawn Paul Beeston's negotiating authority,
later forcing him to resign as baseball's chief operating officer,
and then wasted the off-season and much of 2002 on the doomed idea of
deleting two teams, maybe it could have been resolved long before the
uncertainty and all-night bargaining sessions that disrupted the
division races.</TE>
<TE>   What's done is done, of course, and that's the one, verifiable
certainty about the new labor agreement.</TE>
<TE>   More important than what's in it, or the environmental and
contributing factors in how the owners and players made it happen,
it's done.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a lot nicer than the customary abyss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The New Deal</TE>
<TE>   Players and owners negotiated a collective bargaining agreement
covering four years that includes for the first time a payroll tax.
The tax starts next season on teams with payrolls exceeding $117
million, and increases to a threshold of $136.5 million in 2006.
Other highlights of the deal included:</TE>
<TE>   * increased revenue sharing;</TE>
<TE>   * drug testing for steroids;</TE>
<TE>   * no reduction in the number of teams through the 2006 season;</TE>
<TE>   * an increase in the minimum salary to $300,000 (up from
$200,000);</TE>
<TE>   For the full agreement, see D4.</TE>

<HD>Carr Suffers Knee Injury in Houston's 17-13 Loss</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Texans got a scare and lost the game too.</LD>
<LD>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers knocked David Carr, the No. 1 pick in the
NFL draft, out of the game in the first half with a bruised right
knee and took advantage of two early miscues for a 17-13 victory
Friday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Carr was hurt with 13:57 left in the second quarter when he was
pulled down by Buccaneer defensive end Corey Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Carr walked off on his own and spent the rest of the half sitting
on the bench with an ice pack on his knee and remained in the team's
training room in the third quarter. He returned to the sideline in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed five of nine passes for 58 yards and had two rushes
for four yards.</TE>
<TE>   New York Jets 23, Philadelphia 16--The Jets (4-0) got touchdowns
from two players who might not make it to the season at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Ataveus Cash made his first pro reception a touchdown catch and
defensive tackle Geradie Mercer scored on an interception return.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay 21, Tennessee 20--Third-string quarterback Craig Nall, a
fifth-round pick from Northwestern Louisiana, solidified a roster
spot by leading the Packers on second-half scoring drives of 73, 46
and 82 yards at Green Bay. He completed 12 of 19 passes for 182
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Volek threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Berlin with
eight seconds left in the game to pull the Titans to within a point,
but the two-point conversion failed when the ball went off the hands
of Berlin--wide open in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 20, Cleveland 19--Nick Goings had two short touchdown
runs in the fourth quarter as the Panthers rallied against the Brown
reserves at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pro Bowl tight end Tony Gonzalez of the Kansas City Chiefs ended
his two-month holdout and signed a one-year tender. Gonzalez, who
rejected an $8-million signing bonus and a long-term deal that would
have approached $28 million, signed the one-year deal for $3.05
million.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Matthews was named starting quarterback in the season opener
for the Washington Redskins even though he threw five interceptions
in six quarters of exhibition games.... Guard Leon Searcy of Miami
probably will be sidelined for a third consecutive season after
tearing his right triceps during the Dolphins' 24-22 win over the
Chicago Bears Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Wayne Chrebet of the New York Jets signed a
seven-year, $17.5-million contract that theoretically will allow him
to finish his career with the team.... Linebacker Jamal Brooks of
Dallas could be sidelined up to three months after fracturing his
left fibula in the Cowboys' 28-25 win over Jacksonville Thursday.</TE>

<LD>   Jones won the 100 meters in 10.88 seconds, finishing 0.02 ahead of
Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine, the world champion. In the 200, they
were even halfway through the race, but Jones pulled away at the end,
finishing 0.13 ahead of Pintusevich-Block in 22.11.</LD>
<LD>   Gail Devers avenged her only Golden League loss in the 100
hurdles, finishing in 12.49 and beating world champion Anjanette

Maurice Greene turned in another disappointing performance. Greene
lost for the third time in two weeks, finishing sixth in 10.11.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glad to be in uniform and not on strike, the St. Louis Cardinals
showed why they are a first-place team with everything to play for
the remainder of the season.</LD>
<LD>   In the first game since a new labor agreement was reached, Albert
Pujols hit a three-run homer in the first inning to get the Cardinals
going and St. Louis defeated the Chicago Cubs, 6-3, Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The atmosphere at Wrigley Field was a bit strange, more
back-to-business-as-usual than anything else.</LD>
<TE>   As the Cubs took the field, there was a smattering of applause and
no outward signs of anger or hostility.</TE>
<TE>   Fans sat on the rooftops overlooking the neighborhood park and
enjoyed the sun. But the announced crowd of 36,311 inside was smaller
than usual for a Cardinal-Cub matchup that is usually close to a
sellout (39,111) because of the heated rivalry between two teams in
the same division.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis (74-59), shooting for the postseason, had more to lose
if the players had gone on strike than the Cubs, who are 21 games
under .500.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 7, Arizona 6--Barry Bonds hit a two-run single and
then walked four times and Randy Johnson failed to get his 20th
victory at Phoenix as the Giants held off the Diamondbacks for their
sixth win in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Robb Nen struck out Erubiel Durazo with the bases loaded
to end the eighth inning and struck out pinch-hitter Matt Williams
with the bases loaded to finish the game.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Montreal 2--Pitcher Damian Moss singled and scored on
Darren Bragg's double in the fifth inning and he combined with John
Smoltz on a four-hitter to lead the Braves at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (9-5) yielded three hits over the first seven innings before
giving up Michael Barrett's leadoff double in the eighth. Barrett
took third on Matt Cepicky's grounder before scoring on Brad
Wilkerson's grounder. Smoltz pitched the ninth for his major
league-leading 47th save.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 9, Cincinnati 4--The Brewers began the day in Milwaukee,
waiting to hear whether there would be a strike. Once the team landed
in Cincinnati, it went straight to the park, arriving around three
hours before the start of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Whether related to the threat of a strike, Friday night high
school football--or the opponent--the announced attendance of 16,218
was the smallest at Cinergy Field since May 8, also against
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, New York 5--Travis Lee hit a go-ahead three-run
homer in the seventh inning at Shea Stadium as the Phillies sent the
Mets to their 12th consecutive loss at home.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell of the Phillies drove in three runs to pass 100 RBIs
for the first time in his career to help the Phillies (67-66) win for
the eighth time in nine games to move above .500 for the first time
since they were 5-4 on April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Pittsburgh 3--Only 4,962 turned out at Miami. It was
the fourth-smallest home crowd in club history, all this season. They
saw Kevin Millar get his fifth consecutive two-hit game and double in
the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 2, Colorado 0--Brett Tomko gave up four hits in eight
innings to lead the Padres at San Diego. The Padres got polite
applause from the crowd of 15,987 when they took the field in the top
of the first inning.</TE>

<HD>Watkins' Chances Diminish</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angels are less likely to sell to him now that
labor agreement has been reached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baseball labor agreement reached Friday enhances the chance for
Disney to sell the Angels but further diminishes the likelihood that
the buyer will be Alabama businessman Donald Watkins, who has pursued
the purchase of the money-losing team for six months.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has not granted exclusive negotiating rights to Watkins,
and baseball sources continue to express reservations about his
ability to afford the team and whatever operating losses might
follow. Although he appeared to be the only party willing to make a
deal despite the threat of a player strike, he acknowledges that
labor peace--and with it the uninterrupted flow of revenues for four
years--increases the chance for Disney to find other Angel bidders.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect there will be several more people involved, and it will
be fiercely competitive," Watkins said Friday. "From Disney's
standpoint, it's a seller's market. That doesn't bother me."</LD>
<TE>   Disney executives have not met face to face with Watkins since
June. He said he contacted company officials Friday to alert them
that he planned to submit a revised bid next week. He is expected to
offer $200 million for the Angels, up from the $150 million he
proposed in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Disney made the correct decision to hold onto the team
and ride out the resolution of the labor situation," he said. "Now
that the labor situation has been resolved, I'll be submitting a new
proposal that will more accurately reflect the value of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Disney did not respond to the $150-million offer, a decision that
had less to do with the unsettled labor situation than with the bid
simply being considered too low, sources said. Disney spent $140
million to buy the Angels in 1996 and another $98 million to renovate
Anaheim Stadium, now Edison Field. The Angels reported $100 million
in operating losses from 1995-2001, according to figures released by
the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   With Disney's stock price plunging to eight-year lows, the company
appears willing to write off either the renovation costs or the
operating losses, but not both.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain how, or if, Disney would respond to a new proposal
from Watkins. He privately lists his net worth at $1.5 billion, but
Forbes examined his holdings in March and reported that "we have
reason to doubt the number." In response, Watkins said he would
reveal his financial records only to major league officials.</TE>

<HD>Robinson Finally Gets Past His Pain</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If it isn't a neighbor, it's a writer. If it isn't a student, it's a
Japanese film crew.</LD>
<LD>   Continually nudged to recollect his 1972 Olympic mishap, Rey
Robinson has never been close to forgetting any details of the
nightmare he experienced 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But he has forgiven.</LD>
<TE>   Robinson, a 20-year-old sprinter from Florida A&amp;M, was considered
a co-favorite with U.S. teammate Eddie Hart to win the 100-meter gold
medal in 1972. The three qualifying races to the final were
considered formalities for the duo, who months earlier had tied the
world record by each running the 100 in 9.95 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   After breezing through a morning qualifier on Aug. 31, Robinson
and Hart were due back at Olympic Stadium in Munich later that day
for a quarterfinal heat.</TE>
<TE>   They missed the race and were disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   As the infamous story goes, U.S. sprint coach Stan Wright
approached Robinson while he was receiving a rubdown in the Olympic
village in the afternoon before a heat they believed was to be run in
the evening. With Hart and another 100-meter entrant, Robert Taylor,
at his side, Wright told Robinson to hurry--they needed to leave for
the stadium immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for a bus, Robinson entered an ABC television studio and
inspected a monitor. His 100-meter heat was ready to begin. A graphic
listing the entrants had an N/A next to his name for Not Available.</TE>
<TE>   Said Robinson: "It was like being involved in a car accident
that's your fault when you have no insurance and everyone on the
freeway is stopped to look at you."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Wright accepted blame pointed at him by Robinson and
dozens of international media members for relying on an outdated
schedule. But in an official report to the U.S. Olympic Committee
from U.S. Track and Field team manager George M. Wilson, it was noted
that the sport's governing board, the International Amateur Athletic
Foundation, had conducted a technical meeting 48 hours before the
heat and decided to change the schedule--moving the 100-meter heats
before the three 10,000-meter heats.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he was aware of the change, but was distracted by a
controversy over the size of poles used by pole vaulters and forgot
to inform Wright. Wilson said he believed U.S. coach Bill Bowerman
also was aware of the change. Bowerman denied that, leveling
criticism at the IAAF for failing to effectively communicate its
amended schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, the father of Philadelphia Eagle defensive back Bobby
Taylor, was able to race in his heat and ultimately won a silver
medal behind the Soviet Union's Valery Borzov. Robert Taylor is
believed to be residing in Texas. Bobby Taylor's NFL biography
mentioned Robert in 2000, but doesn't this year, instead noting that
he was raised in a single-parent household by his mother, Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, an assistant coach for a junior college track team (Merritt)
in Oakland who has applied to replace retired Cal track and field
coach Erv Hunt, won a gold medal in 1972 as a member of the 400-meter
relay team.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in
1993, died at age 78 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 50, did not attend Wright's funeral, but he said he no
longer blames the coach for the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson has been men's track and field coach at Florida A&amp;M for
three years, leading the team to two Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference
championships.</TE>

<HD>Labor Pains Are Always a Big Part of the Games</HD>
<DH>History: When baseball players walked out in 1972, it
ushered in a new era for major sports, with America's pastime being
the most troubled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce McNall rolled his eyes in disgust.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to let someone," said the Kings' owner, "who would
be flipping hamburgers for a living if he couldn't skate, tell me how
to run my business."</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1992. The object of his derision was defenseman Marty
McSorley, the Kings' player representative. The subject was the NHL's
first work stoppage.</LD>
<TE>   Darrick Martin clenched his jaw in determination.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody craves the fans, the arenas, the smell of popcorn,"
said the Clipper guard. "We definitely want that. But we've got to do
what's right for us."</TE>
<TE>   The year was 1998. The subject was the NBA's first work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Youngblood shook his head in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "People come up to me," said the Ram defensive lineman, "and say
things like, 'Why the hell don't you go back to work? What are you
[complaining] about?' ... I understand. This is entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   The year was 1982. The subject was the NFL's first work stoppage
in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   All of the above have faded from the scene and there is labor
peace in their leagues, at least temporarily. But the sentiments they
expressed remain unchanged, no matter the sport, no matter the labor
issues. There were echoes of all their comments during baseball's
just-solved labor crisis.</TE>
<TE>   On March 31, 1972, major league players went on strike, marking
the first time one of the four major sports had been ground to a halt
by a labor dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "The losers in the strike action taken," said baseball
commissioner Bowie Kuhn, "are the sports fans of America."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long losing streak. Baseball has been the league
leader in work stoppages with eight, causing a cancellation of 1,736
games over the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   But the other sports have had their share of labor strife:</TE>
<TE>   Football</TE>
<TE>   1970: The sport's first strike lasted only four days in the middle
of summer and no games were lost.</TE>
<TE>   1974: Another midsummer strike, this one stretching over 41 days.
Exhibition games were played during the labor action because rookies
and some veterans reported to camp.</TE>
<TE>   1982: The first big one. Two weeks into the season, the players
initiated a strike that lasted 57 days, causing the cancellation of
98 games and reducing the 16-game season to only nine games.</TE>
<TE>   1987: Again, two weeks into the season, the players struck. But
this one turned into chaos. After a week off, the owners resumed the
schedule with replacement players. After two weeks of replacement
games, more than 100 striking players had crossed the picket line.
The NFL Players' Assn. ordered its members back into camp despite a
failure to reach a new agreement, but league officials wouldn't
permit them to play, citing sudden concerns over injury. After a
third week of replacement games, the striking players returned.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   1995: A midsummer lockout ended before the season started.</TE>
<TE>   1998-1999: A 191-day lockout shrank the regular season from 82
games to 50.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   1992: A 10-day strike at the end of the regular season ended with
the postponed games made up.</TE>
<TE>   1994-95: A 103-day lockout ended in January with the regular
season nearly sliced in half from 84 games to 48.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of bitterness and unhappiness on all sides during
the various strikes and lockouts. But nothing seemed to infuriate
people as much as the NFL replacement games. The owners couldn't
convince anybody that putting a Raider, Ram or Packer uniform on
somebody made them a Raider, Ram or Packer.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got people coming in here who couldn't beat the Sioux City
Buffaloes," Ram defensive lineman Shawn Miller said of some of his
teammates in those 1987 games. "All the Joe Publics, if they are
expecting to see a great game, they've got another thing coming. It's
not even going to be close to the caliber of a good college football
game."</TE>
<TE>   In every sports strike, the owners and players begin as
billionaires and millionaires and finish the same way. It is the
support personnel who are hurt the worst financially.</TE>
<TE>   "The players were complaining about money," Sports Arena vendor
Lamont Harvey told The Times in 1999 at the end of the NBA lockout,
"and they're making thousands of dollars a game. People like me
really have to hustle to make $80 a game. I don't think [the players]
realize that they hurt a lot of people with this."</TE>
<TE>   Can anything stop the incessant stoppages?</TE>
<TE>   "They should just cancel the whole season," said one player, "and
let everybody get a real job."</TE>
<TE>   That player, speaking 3 1/2 years ago about the NBA, was Dennis
Rodman. If Rodman is the voice of reason, then surely both sides must
question their sanity .</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hell has not frozen over and pigs have yet to take flight.</LD>
<LD>   To the contrary, Coach Mike Price figures everything is in order,
now that his Washington State football team is expected to win the
Pacific 10 championship, the first time that has happened since 1961,
when the conference's preseason poll began.</LD>
<LD>   "You've finally got it right," Price said. "It took 41 years to
pick us the favorite."</LD>
<TE>   The Cougars occupied a more familiar position last fall, predicted
to finish last, but wound up playing the role of Cinderella. Their
startling 10-2 record included upsets of Stanford and UCLA in the
regular season and a 33-27 victory over Purdue in the Sun Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jason Gesser sparked the turnaround, leading the
conference with 258 yards a game in total offense and 25 touchdown
passes. Not only does he return as a confident senior, he gets his
entire offensive line back.</TE>
<TE>   The program's renewed standing should not be a surprise in at
least one respect: Pacific Northwest schools have dominated the
conference in recent seasons. Washington, which earned a trip to the
Rose Bowl after the 2000 season, should finish near the top again.
Last season's champion, Oregon, is picked close behind.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional powers USC and UCLA are projected to finish in the
middle of the pack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all over college football ... it's parity," UCLA Coach Bob
Toledo said. "It's a very competitive conference."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Price, 14th year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 10-2, 6-2 in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: For all the talk about Gesser and the offense, the guys
on the other side of the ball were an even bigger surprise last
season, producing a league-best 35 turnovers--22 of them
interceptions--and 36 sacks. "I think the biggest rise in Washington
State's fortunes has been defense," Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter
said. Marcus Trufant returns at one corner and the line is deep. The
toughest conference games are at home.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: An early schedule that includes Nevada, Idaho and
Montana State won't impress the BCS. The Cougars must replace
safeties Billy Newman and Lamont Thompson, and their best returning
receiver, Mike Bush, was suffering from a stress fracture.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes right: Washington State defeats Ohio State on Sept. 14
and makes the pollsters forget about an otherwise soft nonconference
schedule. In this unusually long season, the Cougars must have enough
left for the last three games against Oregon, Washington and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Washington</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Rick Neuheisel, fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 8-4, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: Cody Pickett returns at quarterback, as does receiver
Reggie Williams, a Randy Moss type who burned the league as a
freshman last season. The tailback duo of Rich Alexis and Braxton
Cleman should make up for the loss of Willie Hurst. The Huskies have
finished either first or second in the conference since Neuheisel
came from Colorado three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: The defense fell apart late last season,
surrendering points by the dozens in losses to Oregon State, Miami
and Texas in the Holiday Bowl. Even worse, All-American tackle Larry
Tripplett is gone. Linebacker Ben Mahdavi, the team's leading
tackler, is one of only four players who started every game on
defense last season.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes right: Washington proves it can win on the road in a
tough opener at Michigan today. The Huskies won't get another real
test until Oct. 19, when they visit the Coliseum to face USC. The
last two games are at Oregon and Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Bellotti, eighth year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 11-1, 7-1.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: The Ducks have all the swagger of a nationally
recognized program with another promotional banner hanging in Times
Square and tailback Onterrio Smith, a preseason All-American,
predicting a 2,000-yard season. Keenan Howry could be the best
receiver in the conference. Kevin Mitchell and David Moretti anchor a
solid linebacking corps.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: For all the returning talent, Oregon must fill a few
gaping holes, starting at quarterback, where Joey Harrington must be
replaced. Jason Fife, the heir apparent, is stronger and faster than
his predecessor but has scant experience. Cornerbacks Rashad Bauman
and Steve Smith are gone too.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes right: Onterrio Smith carries the offense behind a
revamped line and the defensive front seven puts enough heat on the
quarterback to ease the pressure on the new cornerbacks. Fife will
have to be steady if he wants to prove to his teammates that, as
Bellotti put it, "there's life after Joey."</TE>
<TE>   USC</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Pete Carroll, second year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 6-6, 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: With a well stocked backfield--Justin Fargas, Sultan
McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie--the Trojans insist they are
returning to a run-first mentality. That would take pressure off
quarterback Carson Palmer, still looking to fulfill expectations that
accompanied his arrival at USC four years ago. All-American safety
Troy Polamalu and phenom lineman Shaun Cody are back.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: The aforementioned tailbacks are already battling
minor injuries and cornerback Kevin Arbet is out for the season,
leaving the Trojans vulnerable at their thinnest position. The
offensive line has yet to prove itself and the first three
games--Auburn at home, then Colorado and Kansas State on the
road--could be killers.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: The Trojans get help from their touted freshman
class, especially in the secondary and on the offensive line. They
survive the first three games and begin conference play with
confidence in themselves and their second-year coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Toledo, seventh year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 7-4, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: Four starters return on the offensive line and the
running game should be in good hands with a combination of Akil
Harris and Manuel White. Matt Ware, who excelled as a freshman last
season, could be even better as he switches to his natural position
at free safety.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: Cory Paus remains a question mark at quarterback and
the defense must replace Robert Thomas, Kenyon Coleman and Marques
Anderson. Just as pressing, cornerback Ricky Manning Jr.'s recent
arrest evokes memories of last season's distractions.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: The Bruins steer clear of trouble and key
veterans--Paus in particular--bounce back from their late-season
collapse in 2001. They should get help from returning kicker Chris
Griffith and all-conference punter Nate Fikse.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dennis Erickson, fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 5-6, 3-5.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: Erickson is too good a coach to let his team crumble
twice in succession, or so goes the argument. With veteran
cornerbacks Dennis Weathersby and Terrell Roberts in single coverage,
his talented defense can blitz more often. Tailback Steven Jackson
averaged 5.3 yards a carry as a backup last season, so the loss of
Ken Simonton might not hurt too deeply.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: Sophomore Derek Anderson takes over at quarterback
with little experience and will need help from a receiving crew that
came up short last season. Kicker Ryan Cesca was all-conference two
seasons ago but has struggled since.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes right: Oregon State opened with a 49-10 victory over
Eastern Kentucky and Anderson gets more time to mature against the
likes of Temple and Nevada Las Vegas. Plus, the Beavers get their
archrival, Oregon, at home in the rainy, hostile environs of Reser
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Buddy Teevens, first year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 9-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: Seven starters return on offense, and that doesn't
include talented quarterback Chris Lewis, who showed his ability to
run and pass as a backup last season. He will be on suspension for
the Cardinal's season opener at Boston College on Sept. 7, but Lewis'
style should mesh with that of new Coach Teevens, who oversaw the
"fun-and-gun" as offensive coordinator at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: Offense notwithstanding, the Cardinal has fewer
returning starters than any other team in the conference. The defense
must be restocked, kicker Mike Biselli is gone and the Cardinal
ranked last in net punting last season.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: Teevens is successful in bringing the Florida
offense to the West Coast and Lewis takes full advantage. It seems
likely Stanford will need points, lots of them, to be successful with
a young and inexperienced defense.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona</TE>
<TE>   Coach: John Mackovic, second year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 5-6, 2-6.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: The offense-minded Mackovic has plenty to work with,
including all-conference halfback Clarence Farmer and Jason Johnson,
a capable quarterback who must find a way to cut down on last
season's interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: The once-proud "Desert Swarm" defense surrendered 34
points a game in 2001 and, although Mackovic hasn't abandoned the
double-eagle flex, he is tinkering with odd-man lines and different
coverages. Receiver Bobby Wade and two teammates were recently
disciplined for run-ins with the police. Mackovic ordered them to
help build a house for Habitat for Humanity.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: Wade doesn't hurt himself on the construction
site, the young defensive line grows up and cornerback Michael
Jolivette returns to the form that made him a freshman All-American
in 2000. With consecutive games against Oregon, Washington, Stanford
and Oregon State, the Wildcats will know where they stand by the end
of October.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dirk Koetter, second year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 4-7, 1-7.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: Junior end Terrell Suggs and sophomore safety Jason
Shivers anchor a defense expected to improve. Kicker Mike Barth and
receiver Shaun McDonald, who led the conference in touchdown
receptions in 2001, should help put points on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: The rest of the offense must recover from the loss
of quarterback Jeff Krohn, tailback Delvon Flowers and receiver
Donnie O'Neal. Freshman quarterback Chad Christensen and the other
newcomers got a rude welcome in a season-opening loss to Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: After that bruising start, the schedule eases
some with Eastern Washington, Central Florida and San Diego State.
The defense needs to carry the burden for the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   California</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Jeff Tedford, first year.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record: 1-10, 0-8.</TE>
<TE>   Case for: The Golden Bears have reasons for hope. The new coach,
Tedford, showed his prowess as Oregon's offensive coordinator and
might coax a big season from senior quarterback Kyle Boller. Joe
Igber, back from a broken collarbone, leads a trio of tailbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Case against: Where to begin? Cal ranked at or near the bottom in
almost every offensive and defensive category last season. Adding
insult to injury, the NCAA has put the team on probation, thereby
ending even the wildest dreams of a bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well: Tedford has a shot at building a respectable
offense around Boller. That gives Cal a shot at stealing a few
victories.</TE>

<HD>KCAL Missed a Chance to Deliver Real News</HD>

<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an August night in Anaheim, traditionally a time and place
where the only things you see falling are the Angels in the
standings.</LD>
<LD>   So what was this? Foul balls hurled by angry fans back onto the
field? Half-filled water bottles flung dangerously from the upper
deck? Outfielders getting hit in the back by pizza boxes? Television
crews running for cover, running for their safety?</LD>
<LD>   At Edison Field?</LD>
<TE>   Home of the Big A in the parking lot and the big Zzzzs in the
stands?</TE>
<TE>   It had to be seen to be believed.</TE>
<TE>   Which, depending the television feed you happened to be viewing
Thursday night, was easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, which carried the Angel-Devil Ray game live for Tampa, Fla.,
covered the disturbance for what it was: a developing news story.
There were images of fans, frustrated by the increasing possibility
of a players' strike the following morning, picking up baseballs
fouled into the stands and firing them back onto the field. There
were shots of fans chanting, "NO STRIKE!," shots of garbage strewn
across the warning track, shots of dollar bills wadded up in disgust
and tossed onto the dugout roof.</TE>
<TE>   This was the same footage eventually shown to the rest of the
nation on ESPN's "SportsCenter," and across the Southland on local
news broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   KCAL Channel 9, which televised the game locally, showed precious
little of that. Its announcers--Steve Physioc, Rex Hudler and John
Ireland--made mention of the fans' behavior, but visual evidence was
highly conspicuous by its absence. Channel 9 kept its cameras
dutifully trained elsewhere, even as the game was delayed to clean up
the debris.</TE>
<TE>   Channel-surfing viewers had to wonder what was--or wasn't--going
on. Judging from its highlight package, ESPN appeared to be covering
an English soccer riot (Tampa Bay at Leeds?) or a bad call that went
against the Browns in Cleveland. Meanwhile, the same game on Channel
9 seemed to be just another 6-1 Angel victory, except with lots of
close-ups of players and coaches looking more distracted than usual.</TE>
<TE>   That was by intent. According to Jeff Proctor, KCAL executive
sports producer, "Our feeling is that generally if you show people
doing kind of idiotic things, it encourages them to do it....</TE>
<TE>   "Had we been at Fenway Park or in New York, it might have made
air. Because our initial inclination is to make sure the Angels are
put in a good light. By showing the fans throwing stuff, a) we don't
want to encourage that behavior, and b) we don't want to put the
Angels in a bad light, as their telecaster, as their broadcaster."</TE>
<TE>   On one level, of course, this makes perfect sense. Usually, the
Angels need no help at all casting themselves in a bad light.
Usually, they need all the backup they can get.</TE>
<TE>   But such thinking casts a bad light on another level, the one they
teach in Journalism 101. News is news, regardless of where it
happens. Channel 9 had a choice Thursday night: Do we serve the
viewers, who have the right to know what's happening, or do we serve
the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   Given those alternatives, Channel 9 opted for happy public
relations over good journalism.</TE>
<TE>   This was not just another night at Edison Field. Outside the
ballpark, KTLA Channel 5 sportscaster Tony Hernandez and his crew
were forced to move the site of their postgame remote broadcast when
angry fans leaving the stadium began crowding around them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hairy," said Tom Klimasz, KTLA senior sports producer.
"Once we set up and put on the lights, it was just like a magnet for
the crowd. And it really, really got ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Klimasz estimated he and the Channel 5 crew were surrounded by a
crowd of 150--"mostly teenagers and young kids, like in their early
20s ... and they were pretty tanked."</TE>
<TE>   After being advised by police to either move their equipment or
cancel the remote for their own safety, Klimasz placed a phone call
to his studio.</TE>
<TE>   "Our segment was supposed to come up at about 10:09," he said. "At
10 o'clock, I called the executive producer and said, 'No way. Safety
is a big issue right now.' "</TE>
<TE>   The crew packed up its van and drove around the stadium,
eventually setting up next to the Amtrak station, where they were
able to film their 10:45 p.m. sportscast in peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been that scared in a while," Klimasz said. "I was
inside Staples, fortunately, the night of the Laker-Pacer
championship [clincher]. But my cameraman, Brian Dunn, was there. And
he said [Thursday night] was similar."</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 viewers had to wait for the postgame show and the
following newscast for a true sense of what happened. Immediately
after the game, Ireland, from the third-base dugout, informed his
audience why there would be no player interviews--because "the
situation had gotten pretty ugly" and stadium security staffers had
instructed players to leave the field.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland then led off the newscast with a report on the
disturbance, finally airing the scenes that Channel 9 elected not to
show during the game. The footage had to be lifted from the Fox feed,
complete with Fox logo at the top of the scene, because the
production staff in the Channel 9 truck did not include those images
in the highlight package it sent to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Better late than never? That is one rule-of-thumb concept that
works better at a New York labor negotiation table than a TV
production truck parked outside Edison Field.</TE>

<LD>Who won?</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles won.</LD>
<LD>   By a margin as giant as Eric Gagne's goggles.</LD>
<TE>   In a decision more clear than David Eckstein's drive.</TE>
<TE>   As the last idiot was throwing the last foul ball onto Edison
Field late Thursday, this was a town of greedy players, abusive fans,
wrecked hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The moment Bud Selig announced a new labor agreement Friday
morning, it became the greatest baseball town in America.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight games left. Two contending teams. A pennant race
squared.</TE>
<TE>   From the heights of baseball's arrogance and insolence has fallen
a month of magic. Directly onto our laps. Landing atop the Dodger Dog
and Rally Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   Who cares that this new agreement lasts for four years? For the
Southland, it's all about the next four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Two great stories, saved from extinction. Two special teams,
rescued from themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Paul Lo Duca was apologizing for militant union
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he is the starting catcher on a Dodger team that could make
the playoffs for the first time in six years.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Scott Schoeneweis was properly chiding strike-sick
Angel fans for throwing junk onto the field, remarks for which he
also apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he is the left-handed middle reliever on an Angel team that
could make the playoffs for the first time in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   With mere signatures, officials transformed the dread of pickets
to the promise of history.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Angels, after all, could end up in the playoffs at
the same time for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   This fact has been pondered by many, but spoken by few.</TE>
<TE>   You can shout about it now.</TE>
<TE>   Our teams aren't necessarily great, but they're tough, and they're
fun, and you can talk about that too.</TE>
<TE>   Looking forward to the Dodgers' four-game home stand against the
San Francisco Giants in the middle of September? It's safe to buy
tickets now.</TE>
<TE>   Actually thinking about driving to Anaheim for one of those four
games against the Oakland Athletics in a couple of weeks? Don't
worry, somebody will be there.</TE>
<TE>   All this may sound like bubbling and babbling, except, if you're
like me, you've spent the last month afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Afraid to invest in a season that might be a fraud. Afraid to
embrace a team that might walk away. Afraid to pay attention to
something that only makes you look foolish.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on the owners and players for toying with our emotions.</TE>
<TE>   But congratulations to baseball for beating them both.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Selig and Don Fehr could have ruined all this, ruined what
could be the best stretch of baseball in this town's history. But for
once, they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in nine negotiations, they lost to a higher
power.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball may no longer be our national pastime, but it is still
our national treasure. It is still worth compromise and concessions.</TE>
<TE>   It is still worth saving.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the owners and players said Friday, even as they were
trying to say something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   The players claimed they were willing to strike. They were not.
They knew what it would do to a game that has so handsomely
compensated them.</TE>
<TE>   The owners claimed they were willing to let the season end on the
spot. They were not. They knew the game could be vastly different
when they returned.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, as with all things athletic, the bottom line wasn't the
sport, it was the money. But in this case, everyone was smart enough
to realize, the game couldn't take many more hits and still bleed the
same green.</TE>
<TE>   The players agreed to weed out their own dirty teammates with a
random steroid testing clause.</TE>
<TE>   Victory, baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The players agreed to clean up the Latin American recruiting mess
with a worldwide draft.</TE>
<TE>   Victory, baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The owners agreed that it was impossible to become the NFL
overnight without dismantling sports' strongest unions, so it didn't
try.</TE>
<TE>   Victory, baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Competitive balance won't occur overnight--the Kansas City Royals
will probably not win a world championship during the next four
years--but this is a start.</TE>
<TE>   More teams can bid for free agents. Great players might move to
places that aren't New York or Atlanta. October will never belong to
everyone. But one day, more will share.</TE>
<TE>   Victory, baseball.</TE>
<TE>   All of which means: victory, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember what a Dodger playoff victory felt like? It has
been 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember what an Angel playoff series victory felt like?
Liar.</TE>
<TE>   From the dreariness of strike talks has emerged the realization
that the Southland could soon experience both.</TE>
<TE>   Victory, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   For the next month, the only Fehr will be the one that Eric Gagne
and Troy Percival strike in opposing hitters.</TE>
<TE>   While the only Bud will be the one you toast in the stands.</TE>

<HD>Revenue Sharing Levels Field</HD>
<DH>Baseball: It won't close gap completely, but it is expected
to make teams in small markets much more competitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Increased revenue sharing in the new baseball labor contract approved
Friday won't inspire the Oakland Athletics to keep pace with the
power-shopping New York Yankees, and don't expect the Minnesota Twins
to suddenly toss around $105-million contracts and private jets.</LD>
<LD>   The wide gap separating the wealthiest clubs from the pack won't
be bridged during the four-year agreement despite more money being
transferred to low-revenue teams, and a payroll tax designed to
discourage spending might not be as effective as many small-market
owners hope. But the revamped system could provide an economic boost
for well-run franchises and give mistake-prone teams a wider margin
for error, and at least that's a start.</LD>
<LD>   "From our standpoint, the best thing that we could ever have is
the ability to preserve what we have created," Oakland General
Manager Billy Beane said. "We're not necessarily looking for a chance
to compete for the greatest free agents, we just want to keep the
guys we've developed.</LD>
<TE>   "If [the new agreement] helps us do that in any possible way, if
it even helps us come close to being able to do that, we'd all be
satisfied. How much it could [help] will be revealed in the next
couple of weeks, but it could be significant."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new agreement, each team contributes 34% of its net
local revenue, after deductions for ballpark expenses, to a pool that
is redistributed equally to all 30 teams. The amount of money
transferred from the high-revenue to low-revenue clubs will increase
from $169 million to $258 million, based on 2001 revenue figures,
when revenue sharing is fully implemented under a phased-in plan. The
Dodgers generated $119.21 million in revenue last season and the
Angels $67.33 million.</TE>
<TE>   Payout figures cannot be determined until revenue is calculated
after the season, but small-market clubs will receive a far greater
percentage of their bigger competitors' profits. Owners demanded
increased revenue sharing because they believe disparity in local
revenue is responsible for the competitive gap between big-and
small-market teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Major League Baseball Players Assn., which contends that poor
management is a bigger factor than owners concede, opposed
revenue-sharing increases, in conjunction with a restrictive payroll
tax, believing it was tantamount to a salary cap. But the union put
aside its objections to complete a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't help as much as good player development, good
administration and good management," said Gene Orza, the union's
associate general counsel. "It will help some because you're
redistributing a sizable amount of money, but competitive balance is
a tricky proposition."</TE>
<TE>   Not according to owners.</TE>
<TE>   The basic concept of revenue sharing is that the entire sport
benefits if high-revenue clubs share their profits to enable low-end
teams to spend more money on players, increasing competitive balance.
Only five clubs from the two lowest payroll groups participated in
the playoffs from 1995-2001, and all lost in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   And of the 224 postseason games played during that seven-year
span, teams from the top two payroll groups went 219-5. The 1998 San
Diego Padres were the only club from a lower payroll group to reach a
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Owners were rebuffed in their attempts to implement a minimum
$45-million payroll, which the union considered to be another
restraint on salaries, and management in turn shot down the union's
proposal to participate in monitoring how clubs spend their
revenue-sharing money. The union sought to sanction clubs that it
determined did not spend enough to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union would seemingly support all 30 clubs having a
salary floor, it opposes any mandates on spending. The fear is that
owners would eventually seek a hard cap in future negotiations if
players open the door on this issue, saying the benefit of a payroll
floor would be outweighed by a ceiling on the high-revenue teams that
drive the market.</TE>

<HD>Surgery on O'Neal's Arthritic Toe Is Set for Sept. 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than two months of angst and analysis, Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal has scheduled the surgery doctors believe will ease
the pain in his arthritic toe for Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, Dr. Robert Mohr will perform the surgery, called a
cheilectomy, at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   The recovery is expected to take about eight weeks, and O'Neal,
the most valuable player of the last three NBA Finals, could miss
most or all of training camp and some of the regular season.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers open their bid for a fourth consecutive championship
Oct. 29 against San Antonio. If O'Neal's rehabilitation follows its
projected schedule--it varies from patient to patient and could take
as much as a month longer--O'Neal would return within about a week of
the opener.</TE>
<TE>   A virus that gripped O'Neal in recent weeks looms as a potential
complication. If he continues to show symptoms of the virus that
forced him to be hospitalized because his body temperature spiked and
liver swelled, the surgery would be delayed again. Perry Rogers,
O'Neal's agent, said Friday that the date was set assuming the virus
would be diminished enough or eradicated in time for the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille wants to get on with this," Rogers said. "We can't wait
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   In cases such as O'Neal's, bone spurs form on the top of the main
joint in the big toe and can grind together when the toe bends
upward, causing pain and limiting mobility.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure is a relatively simple one in which the surgeon
carves away the bone spurs on both sides of the joint so that they no
longer rub together.</TE>
<TE>   It usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes and can be performed under
either a local or a general anesthetic in an outpatient operation.
O'Neal's will be done locally.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, O'Neal had surgery to correct a claw toe deformity in
his left small toe. Because of that procedure and the onset of
arthritis in his right big toe, O'Neal limped through much of last
season, obtaining relief only occasionally, and often through
consumption of anti-inflammatory medication he feared excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said Friday that O'Neal has maintained a cardiovascular
program during the summer and is lighter than he was at the end of
last season.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' Dixon Says She's Ready to Play</HD>
<DH>WNBA Finals: Injured starting guard participates in
practice Friday. Cooper to decide just before Game 2 today whether
she will play against Liberty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She moved gingerly around the court Friday, doing some light shooting
drills and kibitzing with teammates. There was stiffness in her back
and her gait. But that Tamecka Dixon could move around at all Friday
was good news for the Sparks.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon was unable to play in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals Thursday,
won by the Sparks 71-63. She bruised her back and strained the
patella tendon in her right knee when she slipped on wet steps while
exiting the team bus for the morning shoot-around.</LD>
<LD>   Even though it was raining, Madison Square Garden officials would
not let the Sparks' bus park in a dry area closer to the arena,
saying they did not have any bomb-sniffing dogs to examine the
vehicle. So the players had to exit the bus in the wet street.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Michael Cooper said Dixon's availability for Game 2 would be
a game-time decision. He's sure Dixon wants to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year it was almost the same kind of thing," Cooper said.
"She got hurt in the first game against Charlotte and came back on
crutches. But come game time she said she was ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll let the doctors and Tamecka decide. We don't want the
series to go any longer, but the fortunate thing is ... we have two
games here. You want to take care of business and not have to use
that [Sunday] game. But if she's not ready to go, then we'll hold her
out. If there's a third game, she'll be ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   If it's left solely up to Dixon, she will play in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "As I shot around my back loosened up," Dixon said. "I'll play
with some soreness in my knee ... it's a pain I can work through. As
far as I know, I can play unless the trainers pull me out."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said she is not hurting as much as she was last year when
she came down hard on her right foot and injured her heel. In the
title-clinching game against Charlotte, Dixon scored 13 points in 37
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no pain like the pain I felt in the final game last
year," Dixon said. "If I can get through that I can get through
anything. I'm stiff, but the pain level last year was much greater."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie, who said Thursday's was "the most physical game I've
played in my six years here," expects more of the same today.</TE>
<TE>   "The [game] wasn't consistent with what you experience throughout
the regular season," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York set two WNBA Finals records Thursday with seven
three-pointers in a half and nine in the game.</TE>

<LD>Radio--KSPN (1110).</LD>
<LD>   Championship series--Sparks lead, 1-0.</LD>
<LD>   Update--New York is in familiar territory. The Liberty has lost
the first game of every postseason series it has played in 2002 and
come back to win the next two games. This time it will be trying to
win on the road, something it has not done so far in these playoffs.
"I'd like to think we took their best shot, but it's dangerous to
think that way," Spark forward DeLisha Milton said. Milton, Leslie
and Latasha Byears were able to smother the inside play of Liberty
forwards Tamika Whitmore and Tari Phillips, holding them to a
combined six-for-22 shooting. The Liberty cannot afford for Whitmore
and Phillips to be nonfactors if New York is to extend the series to
a third and final game Sunday.</LD>

<HD>Kuerten Earns Overdue Redemption</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: After suffering through an injury-riddled
season, he upsets second-seeded Safin, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>To prepare himself for his match against Marat Safin, the big-hitting
Russian who is seeded second at the U.S. Open, Gustavo Kuerten showed
up for the Spark-Liberty WNBA game Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Kuerten had a front-row seat at Madison Square Garden. He had a
big box of popcorn and wide-eyed appreciation for the physical play.
"They always try to intimidate each other," Kuerten said.</LD>
<LD>   His way has never been intimidating on the tennis court. Kuerten
experiences his sport with a giggle and loose-limbed enthusiasm. His
season has been marked by hip surgery, pain and so many disappointing
losses that Kuerten, who was seeded No. 1 here a year ago, came to
the Open unseeded.</LD>
<TE>   Friday brought some redemption and proof that his elegant strokes
are still punishing, that his joyful spirit has not been doused at
the expense of his competitive fire.</TE>
<TE>   In straight sets, in 2 hours 11 minutes, Kuerten upset Safin, the
2000 Open champion, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   This was the only real surprise of a routine day unless you count
it as an upset that the weathermen were wrong. Rain barely touched
the schedule. Or unless you count it as a shock that Serena Williams,
the defending women's champion, appeared in a new outfit at Arthur
Ashe Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova, who will turn 46 in October, and Leander Paes
of India upended the top-seeded mixed doubles team of Australians
Rennae Stubbs and Todd Woodbridge, 7-6 (4), 7-5. Navratilova was
visibly thrilled, pumping her fist, and Paes saluted her afterward,
bowing in the "I'm-not-worthy" fashion.</TE>
<TE>   And Arnaud Clement's 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over 10th-seeded
Sebastien Grosjean was technically an upset. But the two Frenchmen
know each other's likes, dislikes, backhands and forehands and they
fought for nearly four hours on the tightly packed Grandstand court.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time Open champion and 2001 finalist Pete Sampras moved
safely into the third round. With losses to such anonymous players as
Paul-Henri Mathieu, George Bastl and Andrea Gaudenzi this year, no
match is a certainty for Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   But Kristian Pless, a 21-year-old from Denmark, provided little
resistance to Sampras, 10 years older and 13 Grand Slam titles ahead
of Pless. Sampras used 21 aces, including a big, kicking serve on
match point, to eliminate Pless, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   So pretty in pink, Williams needed seven minutes to win the first
three games of her third-round U.S. Open match against No. 26
Nathalie Dechy of France; 24 minutes to win the first set and 49
minutes to win the match, 6-1, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Williams switched from her single-piece, all-black, self-described
cat suit to a skin-tight pink shirt that was strategically slit to
display a dangling navel ring, and a black skirt. The addition of
pink did not soften the percussive power of Williams' game. Dechy, of
France, never was allowed an opening to move the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Equally overpowering was 1998 champion and No. 4 seed Lindsay
Davenport, who also took 49 minutes to oust 17-year-old qualifier
Marion Bartoli, 6-3, 6-1. Bartoli, of France, ranked No. 231 in the
world and the reigning U.S. Open girls' champion, never had a break
point. Davenport, playing her fifth tournament after missing eight
months because of knee surgery, had 11 aces and 37 winners.</TE>
<TE>   Also moving on was 11th-seeded Andy Roddick, who celebrated his
20th birthday with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 second-round win over Raemon
Sluiter of the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten, a three-time winner of the French Open, has only been as
far as the quarterfinals here. Though he played a quality three-set
match against Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals of the Mercedes Benz
Cup in Los Angeles last month, Kuerten had arrived here after two
first-round losses in Toronto and Cincinnati and little confidence
that his sore hip would allow him the freedom of movement to glide
about the court.</TE>
<TE>   "But I really put a lot of effort on practice and in the gym to be
ready for this one," Kuerten said. "I think everything has come
together at the right time for me."</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten, 25, brought a modest 12-10 match record and No. 46
ranking into the Open and with no seed, Kuerten has been left to
float through the draw, knowing he would have to pick off top-ranked
players in nearly every round.</TE>
<TE>   The Ashe Stadium crowd was firmly behind Kuerten, who bowed to the
fans in appreciation at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," Safin said, "he played one of his best matches. He was
playing fast and he served well."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, who reached the quarterfinals here last year but who
hasn't advanced past the third round of any of the first three 2002
Grand Slam events, said he has found some missing confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually competing and I'm actually feeling my shots," he
said. "I'm hitting the shots I want to hit."</TE>

<HD>Forward Progress</HD>
<DH>The hiring of Tyrone Willingham at Notre Dame is a
milestone, especially considering state's history</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Some day, perhaps, the time will come when it is no longer a social
milestone that a major college football program has hired a worthy
coach who also happens to be black.</LD>
<LD>   That time, however, is not yet here. So when Tyrone Willingham,
who is African American, leads the Notre Dame football team in its
opener tonight against Maryland in the Kickoff Classic at the
Meadowlands in New Jersey, it is a measure of the progress that has
been achieved--but also a sign of how far there is to go.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham is the first black coach in Notre Dame history. Not
only the first black football coach. The first black coach in any
sport.</LD>
<TE>   Notre Dame is arguably the nation's premier college football
program, so the hiring of a black man as coach stands as a landmark.
Pat Haden, the Los Angeles lawyer, Rhodes scholar and former USC and
L.A. Ram quarterback who serves as an analyst for NBC's Notre Dame
telecasts, said, "You hope something like this makes the walls come
tumbling down."</TE>
<TE>   Only four of 117 head coaches in Division I college football are
African American. The three others are Bobby Williams at Michigan
State, Fitz Hill at San Jose State and Tony Samuel at New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing, isn't it?" said Floyd Keith, executive director of the
Black Coaches Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham was not Notre Dame's first choice. Several widely known
coaches, Jon Gruden and Steve Mariucci among them, were secretly
sounded out before the university hired Georgia Tech's George
O'Leary, then dismissed him only days later after learning of
discrepancies in O'Leary's academic record. Only then, late last
year, did Notre Dame turn to Willingham, who at Stanford in recent
seasons had twice been named Pac-10 coach of the year, in 1995 and
1999. What's more, Stanford had defeated Notre Dame three times in
the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Disciplined, methodical, Willingham, raised in North Carolina and
at 48 old enough to remember segregation, has since said many times
over that it is not important that he was not Notre Dame's first
choice. What matters, he says, is the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "You never let your ego stop you from making what is a good and
wise decision," he has said repeatedly since being hired.</TE>
<TE>   His presence in South Bend holds remarkable meaning for anyone
aware of the history of race relations in Indiana. In a dramatic turn
of events for a state in which one in three native-born white men
once belonged to the Ku Klux Klan, the four highest-profile positions
in Indiana sports are now held by African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The others: Tony Dungy, coach of the Indianapolis Colts; Mike
Davis, basketball coach at Indiana University, and Isiah Thomas,
coach of the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Some might call that merely serendipitous. Others say it's proof
of real progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is profound," Dungy said. "When I was growing up [in
Michigan], there's no way we would even have thought to dream of
there being the head coach of a professional football team, and the
head coach of a college basketball team, and a pro team, and the
coach of a college football team--all of them being African American.
For even one of those positions to be held by an African American
would have been too much to think of. But four?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of that, proud to be in the company of those other
three guys."</TE>
<TE>   Keith said, "It tells you how far we can come, doesn't it?
Anything can change."</TE>
<TE>   That it could happen in Indiana, however, is truly such evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana has struggled," said Jim Madison, a history professor at
the IU campus in Bloomington. "But I'm not sure Indiana has struggled
more than America has struggled. In this, as in many ways, Indiana is
America."</TE>
<TE>   Madison, author of a book about a notorious 1930 lynching of two
black men in Marion, Ind., said, "You have to understand how bad it
was in the old days. You also have to understand how not good, how
not perfect, it is today."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1920s, Madison said, about 30% of native-born white men
in the state belonged to the Klan.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana, he said, has historically had "a larger percentage" than
other states of such white natives, and thus Indiana has "had perhaps
a larger capacity to be fearful of others--ignorant of others, and
therefore fearful of them."</TE>
<TE>   Even as recently as a generation ago, growing up black in Indiana
meant learning early about a racial divide. Anita DeFrantz, who went
on to win a bronze medal in rowing at the 1976 Olympics, served on
the International Olympic Committee and now is president of the
Amateur Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles, grew up in Indianapolis.
She said one of her earliest memories--she was, she said, maybe 4--is
of a sign posted to a tree in a small town out in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The sign warned blacks, using a racial epithet, "Don't be here
after dark," DeFrantz recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Klan's presence can still be felt in Indiana. The day after
Willingham was hired, the South Bend Tribune featured stories on the
new Notre Dame coach as well as on the activities of a Klan faction
in Osceola, a few miles from the Notre Dame campus.</TE>
<TE>   Railton Loy, who heads that Klan faction, said this week that he
could not believe Notre Dame had hired Willingham. That Davis, Dungy
and Thomas are also head coaches of their teams shows, "They're going
to hell in a handbasket," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added of Davis, who took IU to last season's NCAA championship
game, "He did a good job for them. But who's to say Knight," meaning
former IU coach Bobby Knight, "wouldn't have done just as well?"</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Willingham said life in South Bend since he arrived
in January has seemed normal. He also said he pays no attention to
those who would pass judgment on him because he is who he is.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I grew up with cross burnings in our [North Carolina]
neighborhood, major [Klan] rallies in the neighborhood," he said.
"That is nothing new. And you don't even think about it. You don't
even let that thought process enter your consciousness. Because you
refuse to be intimidated by anything if you're going to be good at
whatever you do."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, speaking Wednesday after Notre Dame's last on-campus
practice before today's game, said he is not, however, unmindful of
the history here--all the history, not just the fabled Irish lore.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're blessed, the four of us, to have this opportunity,"
he said. "But I also think the four of us are very confident about
our role--not just for budding African Americans but also for other
young men. Because I think we take life very seriously and want to do
something very positive that impacts everyone."</TE>
<TE>   He said he intends not only to develop top-notch football players
but young men with a respect for ethics and values.</TE>
<TE>   One day last spring, after practice, defensive lineman Jason Sapp
found a cellular phone on campus. He spent several hours tracking
down the owner and returned the phone the next day. Sapp sought no
credit, no reward and was surprised when the owner sent Willingham a
note of praise describing Sapp's effort and initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to exemplify to [the owner] what our team stood for,"
Sapp, a junior from Bridgeport, Conn., says now. "I wanted her to
know what I was a part of. It's just a good deed that a lot of my
teammates would have done as well."</TE>
<TE>   It was only a small thing, Sapp said. But, echoing Willingham, he
said, "Small things win championships."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham made it plain he hopes to attract more like-minded
young men to South Bend.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is ... this has not been a university that has been
open to diversity. OK?" he said. "But there are African Americans and
every other racial group that you can name that have values. That
believe in God. That believe respect for self and others is
important. I hope we do have that ability to track that kind of
individual here."</TE>
<TE>   He added, with a smile, that on the football field such young men
had to bring "great talent."</TE>
<TE>   Plainly put, the Irish need more talent.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's team finished 5-6. While trying to master Willingham's
pass-oriented offense, Notre Dame's players will be tested by five
currently ranked teams and nine that played in bowl games last
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish lack depth, former starting quarterback Matt LoVecchio
transferred to Indiana, and Julius Jones, the team's leading rusher
the last two seasons, was ruled academically ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Navy and Rutgers appear eminently beatable, Haden said. But "all
the other games are tossups."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has not finished a season ranked in the top 10 since
1993. It hasn't won a national championship since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, however, is confident Notre Dame will win again. Asked
about it, he said, "Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   If the Irish do win, and win soon, that surely will open doors
faster for other qualified black coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "It should send a message to all athletic directors, and all
coaches who desire to be coaching at a predominantly white
institution that if this can be done at Notre Dame, it can be done
anywhere," Keith said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Irish post a few more 5-6 seasons, will Willingham
enjoy a healthy measure of good will? If so, for how long? Will what
he looks like work for or against him in ways subtle or overt? No one
knows.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham said he fully understands the import of "waking up the
echoes," as it is often put by Irish boosters, the powerful symbolism
of restoring Notre Dame to what used to be its exalted standing in
the national rankings--for the university, for him, for those who
aspire to be like him.</TE>
<TE>   Digger Phelps, the former Notre Dame basketball coach and current
ESPN analyst who has lived in South Bend for 30 years, put it this
way:</TE>
<TE>   "I've said to people that that guy on the cross up there,"
referring to the mosaic of Jesus hovering from the campus library
over the north end of the football stadium, "could go down and go
into that stadium, lose a game and 80,000 people would boo him. You
can quote me on that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got nothing to do with black, white, green or yellow. It has
to do with winning."</TE>

<LD>It's not required viewing, but plenty of the Bruins will be checking
out the Colorado State-Colorado game today.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA opens with Colorado State on Sept. 7 and plays Colorado on
Sept. 21.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope they bang each other pretty good," Coach Bob Toledo said.</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins will have meetings today but won't practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a good scouting day," linebacker Marcus Reese
said. "We're going to see what they've got, see what they're made of.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is good because they're both rivals. They're not going
to be hiding anything."</TE>
<TE>   It might feel as if the season is starting without the Bruins, but
that's all right.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, it helps us," cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. said. "I
remember trying to watch film this summer, and it's kind of confusing
because you don't know who's coming back and you really can't see
who's who. Now you know exactly what's going on, who's playing where
and who's doing what."</TE>
<TE>   The players won't practice today or Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reese was dressed for practice but didn't take part in contact
drills because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said Reese might be cleared by doctors to practice Monday,
but Toledo is already considering trimming Reese's special teams duty
as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   Reese considers his most recent concussion mild but isn't sure how
many he has had and said he isn't worried about repeated damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Shoot, I don't know. I've had quite a few. It's a rough game," he
said. "None of them have been serious. So it's not really scary."</TE>
<TE>   He's just waiting for an OK to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to the doctors," Reese said. "They're very cautious about
concussions. I can't tell the doctors what to do."</TE>

<DH>Business: Members of Southland labor organizations say that

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leroy Hamilton, 66, lives in a South Central Los Angeles apartment.
He is a home-care worker responsible for an 82-year-old Los Angeles
woman who requires daily meal preparation, diabetes tests, bathing
and home clean-up.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton earns $6.75 an hour from a Los Angeles County public
authority, the Personal Assistant Services Council. He belongs to the
Service Employees International Union Local 434-B, which is
negotiating for a 75-cent hourly raise when the county approves its
expenditures Sept. 18.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel very strong about this," Hamilton said. "When you're a
member of a union, you want what's best for your fellow worker. We
are one. We are a whole."</LD>
<TE>   A lifelong baseball fan, Hamilton said there's no better example
of that solidarity than the Major League Baseball Players Assn.,
which got a minimum-salary raise, to $300,000, in its settlement with
owners Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "After watching where they've come from, what they've got and how
they intend to keep it, I'm with the players all the way," Hamilton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the great disparity in the money involved, Oria Green, a
political organizer for SCIU, agreed with Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports is sports," she said. "We don't need sports for our
society to function. The things we're doing for people as home-care
workers are mandatory, things that allow people to live. But I'm cool
with sports.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what you're fighting for in a labor movement,
you have to fight for what's right. And if there are people on the
other side of things willing to dupe you, you have to stick together.
Unions fight for you and make things right."</TE>
<TE>   Green has taken to extreme measures to gain publicity for her
union's fight. On Aug. 20, she said, she was one of 17 SCIU members
arrested for failure to disperse near the Hall of Administration. A
large contingent of home-care workers congregated downtown, some
marching into the streets, stopping traffic and scuffling with
police. The incident drew slight media attention.</TE>
<TE>   Tyrone Freeman, president of Local 434-B, can only dream of
winning the media coverage of baseball union leader Don Fehr,
although Freeman said he would implement more "direct actions of
civil disobedience" as the wage decision nears.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty more to come," Freeman said. "That incident at
Broadway and Figueroa was just a little swig in the hot summer heat,
so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said he was arrested in a union incident last year,
adding, "People don't seem to understand how difficult it is to live
on such a small amount of money."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ponce deLeon, president of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union Local No. 13 in Wilmington, said the number of
similarities in union brotherhood easily outnumbered the financial
differences baseball's union has with organizations such as the
longshoremen's. Many ILWU workers, including Local No. 13, have been
working on a day-to-day contract since their agreement with Pacific
Maritime Assn. expired July 1. Negotiations have stalled on health
care and dock technology issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be an entirely different classification in earnings,
but we're both paid on our skills," Ponce deLeon said. "It's just
that our skills provide more immediately for things like a home and
family. None of us want a strike."</TE>
<TE>   A common philosophy links the unions, said Steve Holguin, an
attorney whose firm represents the home-care workers and
longshoremen.</TE>
<TE>   "Workers are entitled to get what they can," Holguin said. "If the
owners generate good money, the players deserve some too. There are
workers and there are people making money off of them. The worker who
gets the most is the one who realizes the strength in numbers."</TE>

<HD>Matua, Fargas Probably Out</HD>

<LD>Fred Matua, who was on track to become the first true freshman in six
years to start an opener on the offensive line for USC, did not
practice Friday because of a bruised knee and might lose his spot for
Monday's game against Auburn.</LD>
<LD>   Matua suffered the injury Thursday while blocking on a pass play
during a two-minute drill. He said he was sore but hoped to play
against Auburn.</LD>
<LD>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he would wait a day or two before
making a decision about Matua's status. Senior Derek Graf, who
practiced as the backup center throughout training camp, worked in
Matua's place with the first unit.</LD>
<TE>   "Derek has been around a long time, he's adept at our
communications and system and what we're calling," Carroll said.
"With all the work he's done at center, he has to be in charge of a
lot of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Senior tailback Justin Fargas, who strained his right hamstring
before the Trojans' first scrimmage on Aug. 17, also did not practice
Friday after aggravating the injury on the same play Matua was hurt.
Fargas caught the pass, accelerated to full speed and grabbed his
right leg after he was knocked to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas' availability for Auburn was questionable before the
setback. On Friday, Carroll intimated Fargas would not play.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to push it," Carroll said. "We have the long break
after this game that will give him a great chance to be 100% next
time out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Carson Palmer showed no ill effects from a foot
injury that forced him to limp off the field after practice on
Thursday. He participated in drills and moved without noticeable
discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams was not wearing the
protective plastic boot that encased his sprained left ankle on
Thursday. He ran lightly and will be evaluated daily, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Hershel Dennis and senior Sultan McCullough will return
kickoffs against Auburn, Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>In Las Vegas, Baseball Is Strictly Minor League</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Las Vegas breathed only a small sigh of relief Friday when a baseball
strike was averted. That's because in this town, football is king.</LD>
<LD>   Of the $2 billion wagered at Las Vegas sports books in the fiscal
year that ended June 30, $861.1 million was bet on football games,
according to statistics compiled by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
Basketball ranked No. 2 at $529.7 million and baseball was third at
$448.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball is not the national pastime anymore. Football has
supplanted it," said Robert Walker, director of the race and sports
book at MGM Grand and Mirage.</LD>
<TE>   Las Vegas would have been affected by a prolonged strike similar
to 1994-95, when the World Series was canceled. Wagering on baseball
games plunged from $479.1 million to $337.9 million, a drop of 29%.</TE>
<TE>   But Walker said a baseball strike this weekend would not have
disrupted bettors.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have hurt a little bit, but more like a paper cut," he
said. "The timing couldn't have been worse for baseball and best for
us. [Today] starts college football and next weekend is NFL football.
Those are by far our two premier sports."</TE>
<TE>   Sports books would have been required to refund millions of
dollars in World Series bets had the rest of the season been
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put your money on the Cubs or Devil Rays, you wouldn't
mind seeing a strike," Walker said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The discovery of a large rookery of emperor penguins in Antarctica
has raised hopes that the birds were not disastrously affected by a
huge iceberg last year. The appearance in the Ross Sea of an iceberg
the size of Jamaica and an increase in sea ice made it almost
impossible for the birds to find food, causing the deaths of
thousands of penguin chicks.</LD>
<LD>   But researchers on a U.S. Air Force plane returning to New Zealand
from a midwinter resupply flight to bases on Ross Island observed and
photographed the penguins in a large huddle. It was impossible to
tell how many birds were there, but their presence was a positive
sign, said Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Lou Sanson.
Emperors are the largest penguins, standing more than 3 feet tall and
weighing as much as 90 pounds.</LD>

<HD>SPINAL INJURY / Nerve-Graft Surgery Gives Paraplegics Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An experimental nerve-graft surgery allowed a paraplegic woman whose
spinal cord was severed in an automobile accident to reacquire
limited use of her legs, an Italian doctor reported this week at a
San Diego conference.</LD>
<LD>   In a 14-hour surgery performed in July 2000, Dr. Giorgio Brunelli
of the Universita' di Brescia in Italy removed a portion of the
28-year-old's sciatic nerve and used it as a graft to connect the
undamaged portion of her spine to muscles in her buttocks and thighs.
He said the graft allowed the regrowth of nerves connected to the
central nervous system into the muscle tissue.</LD>
<LD>   The patient first showed movement in her legs in September and
since has begun walking with assistance, Brunelli said. The woman had
used a wheelchair for five years before the surgery. "It is
rudimentary walking--she needs a walker--but she can move," Brunelli
said.</LD>
<TE>   Some doctors are skeptical about the procedure, said Dr. Wise
Young of Rutgers University, who has followed Brunelli's research.
Young said the permanent severing of the sciatic nerve guarantees
that a patient loses use of the leg muscles--something that may cause
problems if better treatments are eventually found.</TE>
<TE>   Brunelli stressed that the surgery is experimental, but said he
plans to operate next month on a second patient, a man injured in a
November automobile accident. "I will not give any illusions to
patients," he said. He also said the procedure works only if the
spinal cord is severed in the thoracic region between vertebrae T-7
and T-11.</TE>

<HD>AIDS / Ancient Epidemic Cited in Chimps' Immunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dutch researchers theorize that an AIDS-like epidemic wiped out huge
numbers of chimpanzees 2 million years ago, leaving modern chimps
with resistance to the AIDS virus and its variants. If true, the
hypothesis would explain why chimps, who share more than 98% of their
DNA in common with humans, don't develop AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   The theory stems from a study of DNA in 35 chimps conducted by the
Biomedical Primate Research Center in the Netherlands.</LD>
<LD>   The chimps in the study shared an unusually uniform cluster of
genes in the area that controls their immune systems' defenses
against disease. "Chimps show more genetic variation than humans in
all areas--with this one exception, which is seriously condensed,"
said Dr. Ronald Bontrop, who led the Dutch team that worked with
statisticians from the University of California.</LD>
<TE>   The findings will be published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of the Sciences of the United States of America.</TE>
<TE>   Bontrop said that the chimps' lack of genetic diversity in that
area suggests that a lethal sickness attacked chimps in the distant
past. This unknown disease would have wiped out all or almost all
chimps that didn't have the right immune system genes to fend it off,
leaving the survivors with a uniform set.</TE>

<BD>From Times staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The need to vaccinate all Americans against smallpox may be less
pressing than people thought, according to researchers from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Amid fears that the United States is vulnerable to a bioterrorism
attack involving smallpox, tests on people vaccinated more than 35
years ago show that many of them still carry a significant amount of
immunity to the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, published in the Aug. 29 New England Journal of
Medicine, appears to go against conventional wisdom that smallpox
inoculations are only effective for seven to 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Frelinger and his colleagues said resistance to the
disease among people vaccinated decades ago is waning, but not
rapidly. "We would think that people even 35 years later would still
have substantial resistance to smallpox infection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but some experts are
pushing to have all citizens vaccinated or revaccinated out of a fear
that the virus, which can kill one-third of the people it infects,
could be used in a biological attack. Routine vaccinations against
smallpox in the United States stopped in the 1970s. Washington has
ordered millions of new doses of the vaccine, but is working to
"stretch out" existing vaccine supplies by diluting them.</TE>
