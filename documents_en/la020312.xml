<LD>In what could be considered a prelude to this summer's effects-driven
sci-fi movies, "The Time Machine" performed well, grossing $22.6
million to capture the No. 1 spot in the weekend box office. It also
marked the first time since last May, when "Shrek" opened with $42.4
million, that a DreamWorks movie has debuted in first place. "All
About the Benjamins" grossed $10 million to open in third place.</LD>

<DH>TV*FX's 'The Shield' pushes police drama to the edge of
cable territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Ryan remembers well the furor that erupted when "NYPD Blue"
premiered in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan, the creator of FX's new gritty police drama, "The Shield,"
is from Rockford, Ill., home to one of the numerous ABC affiliates
that initially refused to air "NYPD Blue" due to its bedroom scenes,
violence and nudity. Station managers, religious leaders and several
advertisers felt the show went too far.</LD>
<LD>   "Rockford was a very religious town, and I remember talking to my
mother there about how appalled people were in just thinking about
[how] such a show could be on the air," Ryan said. "It's scary to
think of a time that a whole part of the country could not watch a
show that was so wonderful, especially in its first season."</LD>
<TE>   What a difference nearly a decade makes.</TE>
<TE>   "NYPD Blue" has become a popular mainstay of the television
landscape, its content now barely raising an eyebrow. Meanwhile, Ryan
is waiting for reaction to "The Shield," whose premiere makes that
first episode of "NYPD Blue" look like a Disney movie, featuring
brash treatment of sex, violence and nudity that may be unprecedented
for a network partly supported by advertisers. (As a cable channel,
FX also receives fees from cable subscribers.)</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the show--which is being shot in Los Angeles--cultivated
its own brief controversy by beginning life under the working title
"Rampart," a clear reference to the LAPD scandal involving police
corruption. The producers changed the name when LAPD officials raised
objections, and Ryan said the series has no connection to the Rampart
scandal or real police situations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are other elements of "The Shield" that might prompt
concerns from law enforcement professionals.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene of the pilot, Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is
called in to "interrogate" a child molester who refuses to disclose
the whereabouts of a girl he's kidnapped. Using coarse sexual
language, the detective teases the suspect before taking a box
opener, phone book, a bottle of liquor and other items out of a paper
bag and proceeding to brutalize him--with the approval of his
superiors.</TE>
<TE>   In the second episode, a rookie with strong religious convictions
is persuaded to take part in a ritual called "The B&amp;B," in which he
is taken to a bar for pitchers of beer, followed by a sexual
encounter with a prostitute.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan was surprised by FX's interest in his pilot script, which
revolves around an elite cop unit with an outlaw attitude: "I thought
it was a show that no one would make. The subject matter is too dark.
The main character does something really despicable. The rough
language is essential. I thought it would just be a spec script that
I could show to get other work."</TE>
<TE>   Saying that it turns conventional TV police drama on its head, FX
executives are optimistic "The Shield"--the network's first original
weekly drama--will establish a brand identity for the network that
will place it between the edgy sensibility of its sister Fox network
and the bolder, no-holds-barred fare on HBO and Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that now the country is ready for a show that pushes
boundaries and challenges adults who don't want to pay $16 a month
for this kind of entertainment," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   FX officials acknowledge that they are a bit nervous about how
audiences--and police officers--will respond to "The Shield's" crass
language and depiction of cops who break the law to keep the peace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pushing into territory that is very risky," said FX
President Kevin Reilly. "This is not a show that is going to appeal
to everyone. There will be some sensitivities bruised. We don't ever
expect Johnson &amp; Johnson or PG&amp;E to buy commercials on this show."</TE>
<TE>   He added with a chuckle, "But we're a cable network. We wouldn't
be doing our job if we weren't offending somebody."</TE>
<TE>   According to Ryan, being shocking or offensive is the last thing
on his mind. "I'm not throwing 25 curse words just so I can get 10
in. I know what we can and can't do," he said. "There are certain
areas we stay away from. There are times when the network feels we've
gone too far, and I have to defend that material. If I can't defend
it well enough, then we shouldn't be allowed to do it."</TE>
<TE>   In the fictional police division depicted in "The Shield,"
extramarital affairs, racial insults, off-color pranks, references to
oral sex and X-rated initiation rites are routine. The tightly bonded
brotherhood of detectives is not above beating up criminals or
infringing on a suspect's civil rights. And some department
higher-ups look the other way as long as the crime rate goes down.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the drama is Chiklis' leader of the Strike Team
unit, whose shaven head and solidly husky build illustrate his
bulldog approach to his work. Mackey's effectiveness at his job and
friendship with criminal elements is clouded by a malevolence that
finds him butting heads with his commanding officer, Capt. David
Aceveda (Benito Martinez), as well as perps.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the anti-'Commish,'" joked Chiklis, referring to one of his
best-known roles as the jovial, overweight police commissioner on the
'90s drama "The Commish."</TE>
<TE>   Added Reilly, "He's Tony Soprano with a badge."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, who is almost Chiklis' double with his shaved head and
build, wanted to create an unconventional cop drama with actors who
would not be shoo-ins for People magazine's Most Beautiful People
list. A fan of true-crime books and a former writer on "Nash Bridges"
("Not the most realistic cop show," he quipped), he was inspired by
his periodic ride-alongs with police in San Francisco, where "Nash
Bridges" was filmed.</TE>
<TE>   "The world I was seeing was vastly different from the one that
always shows up on cop shows," Ryan said. "It made me start thinking
about how different the reality was. Then the Rampart scandal broke,
and it showed police in a different light. It was intriguing to see
all the allegations that were being made at the same time that crime
was being reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting dilemma. What would people want if their
safety could be more guaranteed? It's something that comes up in the
pilot: What people really care about is walking to their car without
being mugged, and coming home to find their stereo still there. If
that means some cop has to rough up a few people, then it's don't
ask, don't tell."</TE>
<TE>   As for the character of Mackey, Ryan said, "He's not based on any
one person--he's from my imagination. Most of us have a fantasy about
what we would do if we had the power. This is a cop who is wonderful,
but he also has a code he lives by. There are things he believes are
worth protecting. The audience will hopefully see that what Vic does
makes sense in the context of his code."</TE>
<TE>   As for how he thinks police officers will respond to "The Shield,"
Ryan shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Cops don't watch TV," he said. "The only show cops really liked
was 'Barney Miller.' If they do watch, there may be concern at how
policemen are portrayed. But I'm sure they will agree that most cops
aren't like the ones in 'The Shield.' This isn't about bashing cops.
It's about asking tough questions on what it takes to be a good cop."</TE>

<TE>   "The Shield" premieres tonight at 10 on FX. The network has rated
it TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children under 17).</TE>

<HD>Late Night's List Is Shorter Than Ever</HD>
<DH>Talk Shows* Leno and Letterman seem to agree with networks
that young talent need not apply for their gigs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though they are archrivals in the race for ratings supremacy, David
Letterman and Jay Leno have effectively joined forces in one cause:
Keeping the late-night field clear of an emerging talent who might
someday replace them.</LD>
<LD>   The jockeying for Letterman's services, in fact, underscores not
only the paucity of candidates perceived to be ready to front a
late-night show but also the iron grip with which Letterman and Leno
have held onto their late-night thrones in the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   "This used to be a great forum for young comics to get national
prominence," complained one prominent talent manager, speaking on
condition of anonymity lest he alienate either "The Tonight Show" or
"The Late Show." "And these two hosts almost made a conscious effort
to eliminate that."</LD>
<TE>   The manager noted that both shows had improved talent relations of
late.</TE>
<TE>   But the comparatively gentle, nurturing era in which Johnny Carson
was king of late night and broke in comics on "The Tonight
Show"--introducing them to audiences through repeat visits to his
stage and allowing a few to be guest hosts--has long since given way
to the highly competitive Leno versus Letterman, either-or years.</TE>
<TE>   It's an all-consuming and personal ratings battle that doesn't
allow any other comedic voice to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Carson could afford to be magnanimous; he didn't, for the
most part, have competition. Leno versus Letterman, on the other
hand, is all about competition. Leno consistently wins, much to the
consternation of Letterman, whose ego evidently can't abide simply
being the more critically admired of the two.</TE>
<TE>   His people (it is never Letterman himself) carp that "The Late
Show" loses to "The Tonight Show" in large part because CBS' prime
time and late local-news audiences are weaker than NBC's, an argument
that would seem to belie the average American's ability to point a
remote control at the TV and press a button.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Leno and Letterman have redrawn the politics of late
night, a side effect of their talent and drive, not to mention the
profits generated by each of their shows. Neither has a guest host,
opting to air reruns when they go on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   When Letterman underwent quintuple bypass heart surgery in January
2000, elaborate discussions about who would fill in eventually gave
way to a tiny concession on "The Late Show's" part: For a few weeks,
quasi-guest hosts reminisced about past appearances. Then Regis
Philbin did a night, and so did Bill Cosby. But the point was well
taken: Letterman is bigger than the show itself.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's offer to "The Late Show" host marks the first seismic shift
in late-night since 1991, when it was announced that Leno would
succeed Carson on "The Tonight Show" and Letterman, deprived of his
dream job, eventually retrenched at CBS. That 10 years have passed
since then signals the glacial pace at which the landscape changes in
late night, where two men, now both in their 50s, don't figure to
give way to successors in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, networks are so focused on short-term gains that
talent development has practically ceased, observers say. Thus,
Disney-owned ABC, evidently having decided that it needs a more
profitable product than "Nightline" at 11:30 p.m., seized on a quick
casting fix when the opportunity to enter the Letterman talks arose.</TE>
<TE>   Late-night entertainment is a key potential profit center for the
networks because the successful shows draw a heavy concentration of
men ages 18 to 49, an elusive demographic that advertisers labor to
reach. In addition, the attrition of prime-time ratings has increased
the emphasis on developing late-night franchises.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has been searching for a late-night show for years, knowing
that it can get a jump on the competition by starting a program at 11
p.m. A recent play for Conan O'Brien, host of the 12:30 a.m. "Late
Night with Conan O'Brien," ended when O'Brien extended his contract
at NBC through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, one could argue that with the exception of
Arsenio Hall's late-'80s insurrection, most have failed in late
night, from Dennis Miller to Magic Johnson. It is not a job, in other
words, that is as easy as it might look.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime talent manager Bernie Brillstein, who shepherded the
careers of everyone from John Belushi to Martin Short, articulated
several familiar talking points in the comedy world that resonate in
the bidding frenzy for Letterman: The death of "The Tonight Show" as
a classy breeding ground of young talent; the attendant rise of the
comedian-as-multimillion-dollar sitcom star; and the explosion of
cable channels, which dilutes the creative gene pool and causes a
clutter of talk shows and talking heads.</TE>
<TE>   Before now, ABC has done little in the way of developing for late
night, even as "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher's" stock has
dropped internally. "PI," which airs at midnight, after "Nightline,"
hasn't even been a part of the public debate, further evidence--if
any were needed--that the show won't be renewed at the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Wong, the network's senior vice president of alternative
series and specials, declined to be interviewed, as did Maher.</TE>
<TE>   Also not speaking is Jon Stewart, who many believe is best
positioned to jump into the late-night waters thanks to his topical
satire-talk show "The Daily Show," which airs on cable's Comedy
Central, a cable network part-owned by Viacom, owner of CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who hosted "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend, joked
during his monologue that he would take whatever network role offered
him, including NBC weatherman Willard Scott's job of "waving at old
people."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's "Daily Show" draws fewer than 1 million viewers at 11
nightly, but a wave of positive press has recast him as a kind of
matinee idol of late-night comedy, with the accessibility of Leno and
the cynicism of Letterman but without the more objectionable
qualities of each.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said Stewart reveres Letterman and would be
reluctant to take him on as a competitor, and they noted that he is
signed at Comedy Central through January 2003. Chris Rock, another
proven commodity via his run as host of HBO's "The Chris Rock Show,"
is said by his representatives to be preoccupied with his film
career, both as star and director.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Craig Kilborn, the man chosen by Letterman's
production company, Worldwide Pants, to succeed Tom Snyder as host of
CBS' "The Late Late Show." But although Kilborn has improved the
network's performance among young men, he has done little in his
three years on the air to convince executives that he's ready for a
higher-profile time slot.</TE>
<TE>   In today's era of vertically integrated media conglomerates,
executives talk of using cable channels as "labs" to develop
late-night personalities for the broadcast networks. In this way,
presumably, a comedian named Zach Galifianakis, host of VH1's new
late-night talk show "Late World with Zach," could someday become a
late-night personality for CBS, as both are owned by Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, however, will VH1 exhibit the patience with
Galifianakis needed to develop him, assuming he deserves the chance?
Or is the trial-by-fire that O'Brien survived at NBC, where he lived
on 13-week contracts in his initial months on the air before the
network made a long-term commitment, the exception that proves the
rule?</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, 10 years from now, or 15 years from now, who's
going to be in your living room every night? And how are they going
to work their way in?" said Doug Herzog, president at USA Cable
Networks, who, before a stint running Fox, launched "The Daily Show"
at Comedy Central.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are like pillars," Herzog said admiringly of Leno and
Letterman. And pillars, unfortunately, don't grow on trees.</TE>

<LD>Tom Bonadeo noticed something funny last summer. The traffic patterns
began to change on the broadband service he oversees as chief
technology officer for NTC Communications, a firm that wires hundreds
of apartment complexes near college campuses on the East Coast. Even
though his company had enlarged its broadband capacity, its network
was being clogged up every night with downloads from Morpheus, the
popular file-sharing program that allows music fans to download a
vast array of free songs.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't take long for Bonadeo to discover that students weren't
just downloading songs anymore. They were downloading movies. Lots
and lots of them. I naively asked Bonadeo if these were old movies or
DVDs. "Heaven's no," he says. "They're current ones. And they're not
ones someone's recorded on a video camera in a theater. This is all
top-notch quality digital stuff."</LD>
<TE>   For the last several years, the record business has been embroiled
in a nightmarish struggle to protect its music from being illegally
downloaded on the Internet. The Recording Industry Assn. of America,
or RIAA, estimates that 3.6 billion songs are illegally downloaded
every month. Things have gotten so bad that Michael Greene, the head
of the industry group that puts on the Grammy Awards, devoted most of
his recent Grammy telecast speech to lambasting music fans for
"stealing artists' livelihood," calling file sharing "the most
insidious virus in our midst."</TE>
<TE>   Now the movie business is feeling the heat. Surveys say an
astounding 350,000 films are being downloaded illegally every day,
many of them while still playing in theaters. The Motion Picture
Assn. of America filed suit March 5 against a number of popular
file-sharing services, including Morpheus, Grokster and Kazaa. At a
recent entertainment law gathering, MPAA chief Jack Valenti said
file-sharing "is file-stealing--it's an outrageous despoilment of
precious assets."</TE>
<TE>   Disney czar Michael Eisner was just as blunt at a recent Senate
Commerce Committee hearing. "There are people in the tech industry
who believe that piracy is the killer app for their business," Eisner
said, complaining that high-tech firms' earnings are propelled by
"people getting things for free."</TE>
<TE>   Is there any way for Hollywood to avoid the fate that has befallen
the music industry, which has waged wrenching battles against Napster
and other free file-sharing outlets while record sales plummeted? Are
there lessons Hollywood can learn from the music business' mistakes
and missed opportunities? I asked a number of music industry insiders
what advice they could offer Valenti and their movie-biz peers. When
I couldn't get Valenti on the phone, I figured I'd try a more direct
form of communication.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Jack:</TE>
<TE>   Sorry we missed each other. I did get your messages from the road,
but you never left me your cell number. But no matter--maybe someone
will e-mail you the column. (It's free, you know, we don't get paid
for most of our content on the Net, either). I know the studios are
making you carry the ball on this, since they're too busy dealing
with short-term problems (like bad-mouthing their rivals' Oscar
movies) to worry about a looming technology crisis.</TE>
<TE>   So here's some free advice: Don't waste too much energy on getting
help from Congress. You did a great job of lobbying the Commerce
Committee, which made all the right noises about threatening the tech
firms with draconian legislation if they don't figure out how to
prevent computer users from downloading pirated movies off the
Internet. It probably sounded reassuring to show-biz stockholders,
but you and I know that theft-proof technology is a pipe dream. Just
ask the music-biz guys: They've tried every kind of protection device
imaginable and any two kids from Stanford could figure out a way
around it over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let the lawyers do all the talking. The record business
allowed their legal eagles to lead the charge and they alienated
everyone in sight, starting with the news media and teen downloaders,
their most active record buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many people looked at this as a legal issue instead of a
cultural issue," explains Danny Goldberg, who has run several record
labels in the past decade. "The only people at record companies who
dealt with this were the Internet department and legal affairs, but
unfortunately the lawyers, who see everything in terms of precedent
and worst-case scenarios, were closer to the top hierarchy of the
company, so they dominated the debate."</TE>
<TE>   Don't tell consumers you're protecting artists' rights without
enlisting the artists' support. The record industry has darkly warned
that music will disappear if musicians don't get paid for their
efforts, but with rare exceptions, no pop artists ever came forward
to support this contention, persuading fans that the people really
benefiting from copyright protection were profit-hungry record
labels.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're ever going to get any big movie stars to support the
movie equivalent of [pay-to-use subscription services] Pressplay and
MusicNet, you need to give actors an economic incentive to be a part
of your subscription service," says attorney Peter Paterno, who
represents Metallica, Dr. Dre and other top artists. "If you gave Tom
Cruise or Tom Hanks a 50-50 split of the profits, they'd be out there
... for you in a minute."</TE>
<TE>   Here's an idea, Jack: the next time you go to Congress, bring
Cruise along. If he can open "Vanilla Sky," maybe he can convince
kids not to steal movies off the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Don't preach "The Customer Is Always Wrong" gospel. The biggest
mistake the record business made was shutting down Napster without
providing a decent alternative pay service. As Alex Salkever pointed
out in BusinessWeek recently, all it did was foster a new generation
of "free-floating trading systems built on an ever-changing networks
of PCS swapping encrypted files, a system that's everywhere and
nowhere at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   You can't simply protect the status quo. A whole generation of
consumers has come of age who experience entertainment through
computers, MP3 players, I Pods and other convenience-oriented
devices. Soon they'll demand similar portability for their film
collections. Modern-day technological innovation, from the Walkman to
the cell phone, is all about convenience. If you put your
entertainment in a lock box, you're swimming against the tide.</TE>
<TE>   As RIAA chief Hilary Rosen put it: "You need a business strategy
to go with a legal strategy. You can't wait to put movies on line
until you have absolute security. There's no silver bullet. It's a
circular problem that you'll never solve or get ahead of."</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget to promote the value of your entertainment. The news
media has repeatedly portrayed the music industry as the
personification of soulless corporate greed. This happens when you
price CDs higher than LPs, even when they're cheaper to produce.
Miraculously no one seems to have noticed that DVDs routinely cost $5
more than video tapes, even though they cost no more to manufacture,
perhaps because they do offer value-added extras.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't lose sight of the fact that for all its ills, downloading is
a fantastic delivery system. Getting entertainment free isn't always
piracy; it's also a proven marketing tool. At the same time that
record labels were demonizing kids for downloading music without
paying, Lost Highway Records was giving away thousands of "Oh
Brother, Where Art Thou?" CDs to promote the soundtrack, which is one
reason it ended up being such a hit. One man's bootlegging is another
man's word-of-mouth. If "Matrix Reloaded" is as good as the original
and some hacker put half the movie on the Net, it would only make
fans that much more excited about seeing it in a theater. In theaters
or DVDS or the Internet, content still counts.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, don't be afraid of the future. Remember when you
said VCRs were the "Boston Strangler" of the film biz? Now home video
is the industry's biggest profit center. New technology has a funny
way of appearing scary at first glance, but it often opens the door
for unforeseen business opportunities. I bet a lot of people thought
Fed Ex would be wiped out when fax machines and e-mail came along,
but the company is doing just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't fight disruptive technology--you have to learn to adapt
to it," says Jim Guerinot, who manages No Doubt, Beck and Offspring.
"It's wrenching for big companies to have to change their business
model and rethink their notions of profit margins. But there's a
gigantic collection of entertainment fans out there. The industry
can't treat them like the enemy. You have to follow where the market
is going."</TE>
<TE>   It's sound advice, Jack. If Hollywood is good at anything, it's
giving people what they want. The trick is finding a way to get them
to pay for it.</TE>

<HD>From Jelly-Filled to Hard-Nosed</HD>
<DH>Television* Actor Michael Chiklis has been physically and
mentally revitalized in his new tough-guy role as a detective on 'The
Shield.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title character of ABC's 1990s drama "The Commish," paunchy
police commissioner Tony Scali, never let chasing a criminal get in
the way of a good meal.</LD>
<LD>   "Chases usually lead to ... injuries, but no one ever got hurt by
a bowl of linguini," said Scali, as played by Michael Chiklis.</LD>
<LD>   So guess what Chiklis is doing in the opening scene of his new FX
show, "The Shield," in which he plays a hard-driving and hard-living
police detective?</LD>
<TE>   One clue: There's not a strand of linguini in sight. Chiklis is
not only chasing down a drug dealer through alleys and down busy
streets. He also seems to be running from the perceptions created by
past roles, from "The Commish" to his portrayals of John Belushi in
"Wired," Curly in ABC's "The Three Stooges" movie and the rotund,
happy-go-lucky father in NBC's short-lived sitcom "Daddio."</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the pot belly and thinning hair, replaced by a stocky,
buff physique and shaved head that complements the glowering persona
of his new role, Det. Vic Mackey. Despite the character's
overpowering dark side and violent nature, Chiklis says he has been
revitalized, physically and mentally, by the part.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a gift," Chiklis said. "Rarely does an actor get to
play this kind of three-dimensional character. He is gray and
ambiguous. This role is challenging on so many levels. In the past,
I've always played these roly-poly, genial guys. My heaviest lifting
has been a doughnut. Now I'm getting thrown around. I'm just full of
bruises."</TE>
<TE>   Chiklis indirectly credits the critical bruising he took on
"Daddio" for his new look. The comedy about a stay-at-home father was
yanked off the air a few weeks into its second season last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very painful experience for me," he said. "It was a
sweet family show I did for my children and the way the whole thing
panned out was very painful. There was a tremendous amount of anger
leveled at the show from the critics. I needed to find a way to get
out of the pain, so I hit the gym and vowed to get into shape. I
thought, 'I'll just go the other way in terms of career direction.'"</TE>
<TE>   Chiklis is disturbed by some of the scenes he's been involved in
playing Mackey: "We're dealing with some real sordid things here. And
Mackey has to put on a real hard shell as his armor, otherwise he
won't survive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he's amused at his unsmiling face plastered on billboards
and bus placards as part of FX's promotion for the series.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought, 'That's pretty cool,' and then I think, 'Oh
boy,' and start to worry about what it all means," Chiklis said.
"Right now I'm living in the moment and enjoying it."</TE>

<DH>The beguiling 'Central European Avant-Gardes' at LACMA
highlights unfamiliar yet riveting artists who sought to overcome
inequity and achieve modernity in the early 20th century.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who is Katarzyna Kobro? The obscure sculptor, born in Moscow to a
German father and a Russian mother in 1898, is today known mostly to
a coterie of specialists in a niche field of early 20th century
abstract art. By the time of Kobro's untimely death in Lodz, Poland,
in 1951, most of her adventurous sculpture from the 1920s and 1930s
had long since been destroyed, some by her own hand and some by the
Nazis. What little that remained was soon obscured from the West by
the Iron Curtain.</LD>
<LD>   Who is Wladyslaw Strzeminski? Like Kobro, whom he married in 1921,
the avant-garde painter today hovers beneath the radar of all but a
few historians of Modern art. Strzeminski, in addition to making
chromatic abstractions whose radical simplicity articulated the
fundamentals of easel painting, published important theoretical texts
on art (sometimes written with his wife). In 1931 he also assembled
the Collection of Modern Art in Lodz, a sizable group of progressive
works that made New York's fledgling Museum of Modern Art look almost
Victorian by comparison.</LD>
<TE>   Kobro and Strzeminski are two of the riveting artists in the
beguiling exhibition "Central European Avant-Gardes: Exchange and
Transformation, 1910-1930," which opened Sunday at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. It is loaded with unfamiliar names. Partly
Kobro and Strzeminski draw your eye because they seem so artistically
prescient. Their work anticipates features of American Minimalist
painting and sculpture by more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Strzeminski's paintings are visually taut surfaces of textured
color. Shifts between crimson and orange or fleshy pink and off-white
are crisp and blunt; but the textured application of paint and the
balanced scale of the relative color-shapes are such that the broken
fields read as flat, seamless surfaces. No illusion of foreground and
background breaks their material spell, which has an almost spiritual
edge of interconnectedness.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings owe something to the older Russian, Kasimir
Malevich, whose Suprematist art pioneered geometric abstraction. But
they also put you in mind of Robert Ryman since the 1960s; he's found
endless ways to apply paint to a flat surface in poetic answer to the
question: What is a painting?</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Kobro conquered space in a way that feels even more
radical. Her earliest sculpture (from 1924) is made from panes of
glass, a yellow ball, a metal armature and a sinuous strip of wood
whose contour suggests an elongated guitar. It shows her
extrapolating Cubist still-life painting into three dimensions,
turning recognizable objects into a concise articulation of a
unified, transparent field of time and space.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, all recognizable referents disappear. Kobro began to use
sheets of painted steel, sometimes curved and often abutted at right
angles, to make sculptures she called "Space Compositions." Forget
bronze, wood or stone, ; her industrial objects speak of the
construction of new worlds-- without ever mimicking machine forms.
Employing white, black and primary colors, the anti-illusionistic
sculptures are committed to principles of clarity and organization.</TE>
<TE>   Their compositions are also modular: Mathematical formulas, such
as the Pythagorean Golden Section, guide relationships among
individual parts, as well as between parts and the whole. (Simply
described, the shorter is to the longer as the longer is to the sum
of the shorter plus the longer.) They recall the Russian avant-garde
sculpture of Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko, but they also
make you think of contemporary work by Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt.
The link is pointedly acknowledged by the pedestals LACMA designed
for the display of Kobro's tabletop sculptures, pedestals that recall
LeWitt's 1960s sculptures of open-form cubes.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA curator Timothy O. Benson has brought together some 300
works for "Central European Avant-Gardes." Not all of them are as
invigorating and revelatory as Strzeminski's paintings and Kobro's
sculptures. More common are curious groupings like a 1912 ash and
leather settee designed by Josef Gocar, flanked by contemporaneous
paintings by Vaclav Spala and Bohumil Kubista.</TE>
<TE>   All three artists worked in Prague. Spala's "Brick Factory,"
painted in chunky pinks, greens, blues and grays, applies decorative
color to an industrial image whose style is derivative of earlier
Cubist landscapes by Parisian Georges Braque. Gocar's settee is
designed in zigzag shapes, joining the wood grain to create an
illusion of three-dimensional Cubist facets. The crystalline facets
in Spala's landscape and Gocar's settee take on the specter of
hocus-pocus in Kubista's Cubist painting of a hypnotist and his
patient (imagine a crystal swinging in front of your eyes; you are
getting sleepy, sleepy). These three works--by turns corny,
flat-footed and too clever by half--demonstrate a longing for
artistic modernity that far outstrips the available talent.</TE>
<TE>   That longing, though, is among the most appealing aspects of this
exhibition. You feel it around every corner. These are artists who
wanted desperately to be modern, to escape the shackles and inequity
of established society and to participate in the heady construction
of a new paradigm. Some, like Kobro and Strzeminski, had the
wherewithal to do it. Most didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, some of the most compelling work in the show comes
in nontraditional forms. There are editioned multiples like
innovative prints (Laszlo Peri's crisp, 1922-23 linocuts on shaped,
die-cut paper look like little Frank Stellas). Mixed media works rely
on machine printing, typography and found objects (the collages of
Karel Teige and Jindrich Styrsky create pictorial poems). And
cross-media experimentation aims for a whole new dimension (the
psychology of perception as it relates to color and sound anchors
work in music and stage design by Miroslav Ponc, Friedrich Kiesler,
Josef Matthias Hauer and Franz Pomassl). The Modernist urge to "make
it new" is strong.</TE>
<TE>   And it was likely made even stronger by social circumstances. The
exhibition focuses on artists working in 14 central European cities,
including Weimar, Ljubljana, Budapest, Warsaw, Belgrade, Bucharest
and Berlin. In 1910 these were mostly social and cultural capitals of
old agrarian and feudal societies, which hadn't participated in the
century-long build-up of industrialization that characterized Western
Europe. But they were not immune to the convulsions of the first
industrialized conflict, World War I, which left a redesigned
landscape of nation-states throughout Central Europe.</TE>
<TE>   To the east lay Moscow, seat of a Utopian revolution. To the west
was Paris, home of art's established avant-garde. The conflicted
territory in between became, in a sense, the site of the
internationalization of the avant-garde. Along with the first "world"
war came a rush toward the first "world" art. The turbulence of
Expressionism was challenged by the clarity of formal relationships
in International Constructivism, exemplified by Kobro and
Strzeminski.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition begins to tell its complex story, which can better
be unraveled now that the Cold War is over and access to art in the
region is less restricted. Think of the episode as the prologue to
today's globalization, which is likewise having profound economic,
social and artistic ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few stumbles in the show. In one gallery, for example,
Kobro's remarkable "Space Compositions" are lined up in a wide
alcove. That means you can't walk around them. The sculptures become
frontal, like paintings. The installation defeats the unity of
geometric sculpture and fluid space that is Kobro's distinctive
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Reconstructions of lost works can also be a problem for shows that
tackle this period. Between Hitler and Stalin, much avant-garde art
in the region has not survived. Kiesler's 1924 Constructivist display
system, erected from two-by-fours and wooden slats painted red, white
and black, is identified as a reconstruction, but only if you read
the label closely. The same goes for a video projection of
"Pharmacy," a lost photomontage film from the 1930s by Franciszka and
Stefan Themerson. They should be more clearly flagged as copies and
approximations.</TE>
<TE>   These are small matters, though, for an exceedingly important
exhibition. LACMA has made a specialty of this kind of show over the
last two decades, beginning with "The Avant-Garde in Russia,
1910-1930: New Perspectives," and continuing with a variety of large
exhibitions focused on Modern art in Germany. American museums
typically look to France as the big story in Modern art. LACMA has
distinguished itself by looking to other pockets of extraordinary
activity, and "Central European Avant-Gardes" extends the singular
tradition.</TE>

<LD>   Another Daytime</LD>
<LD>   Talk Show Is Canceled</LD>
<TE>   The world of daytime talk shows seemed to be in turmoil Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell already had announced plans to leave her program
at the end of the season. Now comes word that Sally Jessy Raphael's
show, the longest-running of its genre, has been canceled after
nearly two decades on the air. And Oprah Winfrey confirmed that she
will end her top-rated program at the end of the 2006 season, the
show's 20th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Though Raphael's producers had tried to give the show a makeover,
building a new set and giving viewers a peek behind the scenes, they
didn't succeed in arresting the show's ratings slide. Raphael, third
after Winfrey and Jerry Springer three years ago, had sunk to ninth
in talk-show ratings. Studios USA Domestic Television, which
distributes the show to about 190 U.S. television stations, said it
will pull the plug when the current season ends this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Raphael, a former disc jockey, began the show as a local St. Louis
program in 1983 and went national the following year. "I am proud
that we were able to help so many guests and viewers find solutions

<TE>   '9/11' Documentary Scores Big Ratings</TE>
<TE>   CBS' documentary "9/11" drew huge ratings on Sunday, attracting an
estimated 39 million viewers, the largest audience for any
non-sporting event broadcast this season.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring limited commercial interruptions and unedited language,
the production showcased previously unseen footage of firefighters
inside the World Trade Center, shot by French filmmakers Jules and
Gedeon Naudet.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings, not surprisingly, were especially strong in the New York
City viewing area, where more than 35% of all households tuned in
(compared to 22%, for example, in Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   The audience was comparable for viewing during the recent Winter
Olympics closing ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters who watched the show told the Associated Press they
found it accurate and sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's history, and history has to be documented and it's got to be
shown to the world," said retired firefighter John Vigiano, who lost
both his sons in the terrorist attack.</TE>

<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Adams and John:</TE>
<TE>   a Budding Team</TE>
<TE>   Elton John, who has been spending a lot of time touring with
fellow piano man Billy Joel, is also sharing the microphone
increasingly with a guitar man--singer-songwriter Ryan Adams.</TE>
<TE>   John has been championing the alt-country star for months in his
Interview magazine column, thanked Adams for his inspiration in the
credits of his recent "Songs From the West Coast" album and appears
in Adams' video "Answering Bell." And, next Tuesday in New York, the
pair will tape an episode of Country Music Television's "Crossroads"
series, which brings together country-leaning artists with pop or
rock acts. The show will air in May.</TE>
<TE>   John and Adams will get together again March 24 at John's 10th
annual Oscar night party at Moomba in West Hollywood. Sponsored by
the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the event has raised more than $30
million for AIDS prevention programs and services.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   'Lion King' Closing Doors at Year's End</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. production of Disney's "The Lion King" will close at the
end of this year, after it marks its second anniversary at the
Pantages Theatre in Hollywood in October.</TE>
<TE>   According to producer Tom Schumacher, the show is selling out on
weekends and has made a profit--though he would not disclose figures.
In January, Disney Theatrical officials reduced seating capacity in
the theater from 2,704 to 2,261, creating better box-office
percentages.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. production will move to Chicago for a spring 2003
opening.</TE>

<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   KPFK to Use Donations to Fix Transmitter</TE>
<TE>   Despite the refusal of a couple of on-air personalities to
participate in its fund-raising drive, KPFK-FM (90.7) reported
receiving unprecedented donations--$914,000--from listeners for its
"Save Our Signal" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Though KPFK has what officials there say is the capacity to reach
more listeners than almost any station in the country, it is now able
to operate at only 30% of capacity. With the new funding, officials
say they can repair a faulty transmitter and begin broadcasting at
full strength, possibly by this summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Malcolm in the Middle" star Jane Kaczmarek, who had been absent
from the set for a few weeks due to a reported salary dispute, has
returned to work on the season's last episode. Insiders said it was
unclear whether the actress received a raise.... Megan Mullally, who
just won a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actress in a comedy
series ("Will &amp; Grace"), will head the cast of "He Hunts," Philip
Lattell's new translation and adaptation of Georges Feydeau's farce
"Monsieur Chasse!," opening at the Geffen Playhouse on April 17....
"The Art of Paul McCartney," 70 paintings, sculptures and photographs
by the former Beatle, will be exhibited May 24-Aug. 4 at Liverpool's
Walker Art Gallery.... The Spanish-language network Telemundo
premiered its first unscripted series on Monday. In "Protagonistas de
Novel," 20 contestants live in a TV station for two months, facing
dancing, acting and singing challenges. At the end of the series,
airing weeknights at 9 on KVEA-TV Channel 52, 12 of the participants
will be chosen for roles on a future Telemundo melodrama.</TE>

<HD>Hubbard Street: A New Destination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jiri Kylian's magnificent Nederlands Dans Theater already operates
two satellite companies in the Hague, but a splendid performance
Sunday by Hubbard Street Dance Chicago suggested that the Windy City
now holds a fourth Nederlands ensemble--or at least an unofficial new
spinoff.</LD>
<LD>   Hubbard Street artistic director Jim Vincent came to Chicago in
2000 after a career that included 12 years as a dancer and ballet
master with Nederlands. At the Alex Theatre in Glendale, he presented
an exciting four-part program dominated by European Modernism: two
works commissioned for Kylian's dancers and one very much in the same
style.</LD>
<LD>   Only Trey McIntyre's accomplished sextet "Split" reflected
pre-Vincent Hubbard Street traditions in its emphasis on breezy,
buoyant jazz dancing. Recorded Art Blakey percussion invited
high-velocity attacks, but McIntyre never asked his dancers to outrun
the accompaniment. Instead, he focused on deft, gymnastic partnering
switcheroos--initially in a trio for Kendra Moore, Francisco Avina
and Joseph P. Pantaleon, and later in a duet for Massimo Pacilli and
Mary Nesvadba. The addition of Yael Levitin inspired playful new
partnerships and a finale loaded with rapid lighting, costume and
backdrop changes before the cast marched shoulder to shoulder into a
sly fake-out ending.</LD>
<TE>   So much for Hubbard Street Americana. Vincent's own "counter/part"
may have been choreographed in Chicago, but it pursued a Nederlands
aesthetic in its unorthodox juxtapositions: alternating passages of
orchestral and keyboard Bach that accompanied dramatic shifts between
social and personal perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Identified as a "new work in preview," it began with the ensemble
in surging formalist choreography wearing abstractions of Baroque
clothes. Soon, however, Vincent introduced the nearly nude Mario
Alberto Zambrano as an embodiment of pure impulse, absolute physical
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In other intimate passages, however, Lauri Stallings portrayed a
more enigmatic figure: a woman handed from man to man, constricted
and diminished by each partnership but always remarkably passionate
in seeking what Zambrano represented.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Vincent left her plight under-defined in an ending
that layered and then integrated soloists and ensemble, making
Zambrano something of a catalyst but sacrificing the deeper
implications of the work in favor of structural symmetry.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, two Nederlands acquisitions by Israeli choreographer
Ohad Naharin, proved unconcerned with structure or depth but sought
new pathways to dance expression by breaking as many rules as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Against English folk and theater ballads, Naharin's duet
"Passomezzo" undermined partnering conventions, asking Gregory Sample
to support Robyn Mineko Williams while walking on his knees, or prone
or with his hand covering her face. An exchange of roles and then a
dodgy, hyperkinetic equality ended the experiment.</TE>
<TE>   Naharin's "Minus 16" used an archive of cha-cha and bossa nova
singles to accompany an assault on the whole entrenched theatrical
status quo. One section, for example, found the dancers inviting
audience members to join them on the stage--not just a brief, token
moment of contact, but an extended essay in
hands-across-the-footlights camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   Another section involved solos accompanied by the dancers' own
taped confessions: everything from accounts of family discord to a
catalog of tattoos and a recipe for guacamole. And whenever the
various activities began to look random or anarchic, Naharin threw in
passages of impossibly wild, flung-out group dancing--executed in
perfect unison.</TE>
<TE>   He also proved shameless in stealing from himself: The formal
choreography in "Minus 16"--dancers seated in chairs executing a
complex cycle of movement motifs--came straight from his "Axioma 7,"
performed locally by the Rambert Dance Company in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The big question "Minus 16" raised is what we really want from a
dance event--a nice, neat display up on a stage or maximum knowledge
of and proximity to the dancers themselves? With a cheering ovation
Sunday, the Alex audience voted for the latter.</TE>

<HD>Is 'Undeclared' Getting Expelled?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE MARGULIES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If this turns out to be the final episode of "Undeclared" tonight
(8:30 p.m., Fox)--and there is every reason to believe it will--you
can say the comedy series went out not with a bang but with
whimpering.</LD>
<LD>   Lizzie (Carla Gallo) is upset because her friends' attempts to dye
her hair go awry. Steven (Jay Baruchel) mopes because he has to tend
to Lizzie's frazzled psyche instead of joining his buddies in
watching videos of naked women. And Eric (Jason Segel) is tormented
over his breakup with Lizzie.</LD>
<LD>   Such woe! So few laughs!</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't supposed to end like this.</TE>
<TE>   The first-year show about life at a fictional California college
got off to a good start last fall, pulling in decent ratings and
winning praise from critics. The Museum of Television &amp; Radio thought
enough of the series to include it in the William S. Paley Television
Festival last week.</TE>
<TE>   But along the way, the audience began to dwindle, and while Fox
hasn't officially canceled the show, the network certainly delivered
a vote of no confidence by cutting the season order from 22 episodes
to 17.</TE>
<TE>   That resulted in tonight's installment having to serve as the
season-ender, which is pretty strange, since most of it takes place
off-campus as Eric lamely attempts to analyze a phone message to
figure out where things stand with Lizzie.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Stiller makes a guest appearance as Eric's former stepfather,
an even sorrier soul than most of the regulars. "There is nothing as
good as the love of a good woman," he tells the younger man. "Except
Ecstasy."</TE>
<TE>   What "Undeclared" does have going for it is a refreshingly
natural, non-jokey style of staging and performance. But that goes
only so far. Because when the characters are all acting like dolts,
realism isn't actually a positive.</TE>

<HD>Eastern and Western Styles Converge at 10th 'Musics Alive!'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, the mini-festival "Musics Alive!" sprouted in Ventura
County, fueled by an intriguing premise--blending new and world
music. In this offshoot of the New West Symphony, programming focuses
on contemporary classical and non-western "world music."</LD>
<LD>   Last weekend's 10th-anniversary festival was host to Chinese
composer Bright Sheng, who came to the U.S. in 1982.  As a testament
to his music's strength, the audience was left wanting more, beguiled
by cultural interweaving of Eastern and Western styles and even bawdy
humor in three of his pieces in the program.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday at the San Buenaventura Mission's Serra Center, the
highlight was the West Coast premiere of Tan Dun's "Crouching Tiger
Concerto," adapted from his Oscar-winning "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon" film score. But for its charms and commanding solo work by
cellist Mark Tanner, it also has the detached air of music written to
serve another master--images on the screen.</LD>
<TE>   More musically captivating was Bright Sheng's "Flute Moon,"
written in 1999 and nicely played by members of the New West
Symphony, with soloist Paul Fried on piccolo and flute.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the music continued in the reverberant Ventura City
Hall Atrium. Sheng played piano on his captivating "Four Movements
for Piano Trio," joined by skillful string players--cellist Erika
Duke-Kirkpatrick and violinist Alan Grunfeld. Based on Chinese folk
songs, the work is sweetly melancholic and energetic.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based composer Joan Huang's "Remembering South River
Land" also creates its tapestry from folk songs. This moving work was
played with customary poise by pianist Gloria Cheng, along with
Grunfeld and clarinetist Donald Foster.</TE>
<TE>   Ge Gan-Ru's intense, righteously dissonant "Si" is less idyllic;
it's a programmatic view of the protests and massacre at Tiananmen
Square. On lighter turf, Sheng's pocket-size "opera," the
seven-minute "may I feel, said he," is based on e.e. cummings'
playfully salacious poem about illicit lovers, a lightheaded finale
to the festival.</TE>

<HD>Enchanted Search for the Heart of 'Amelie'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ACHRENE SICAKYUZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A new breed of tourist has invaded the hilltop urban village of
Montmartre here: the "Amelie" fan.</LD>
<LD>   This particular species wandering the congested, winding streets
has roots all over the world, especially in Europe and Japan. Its
members have a common trait: They adore the movie "Amelie."</LD>
<LD>   The story of their pilgrimage began last April with the release of
director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film, which is up for five Academy
Awards this month, including best foreign language film.</LD>
<TE>   Titled in French "The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain," it's
about a sullen, lonely young waitress, played by Audrey Tautou, whose
life turns upside down when she discovers a child's secret box hidden
in her bathroom floor and goes looking for its owner, now an adult.</TE>
<TE>   From that moment of discovery, Amelie also makes a most
un-Parisian decision: She will dedicate herself to intervening,
sometimes mischievously and intrusively, in people's lives to make
them happy. The enchantment of this simple premise, which is
presented with subtle, tender humor, is what's drawing devotees to
the places where the film was shot.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones who come here are looking for the joie de vivre that she
left in their minds," says Monique Labbe, co-owner of the Cafe des
Deux Moulins, the real-life establishment where much of the movie is
set.</TE>
<TE>   Labbe's family-run cafe is located at the corner of Lepic and
Cauchois streets, a block from the fabled Moulin Rouge cabaret and
below the steps of the Sacre-Coeur church. With its large copper bar,
a few tables on the sidewalk and a cigarette counter, the Cafe des
Deux Moulins--named after two nearby windmills that have survived
urbanization--doesn't seem much different from the other cafes lining
the sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   But a detail catches the eye: the big "Amelie" poster covering the
back wall. The cafe, which is the heroine's workplace, has become an
outpost of Amelie-mania.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to celebrating Montmartre, "Amelie" created a style, a
look and an atmosphere that have become a reference point for
journalists, politicians and designers. It is slowly earning a place
in the French cultural patrimony.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the French press often describes joyful, lighthearted
and happily naive situations as "la Amelie Poulain." The newspaper
Liberation recently labeled designer Jean-Paul Gaultier's summer 2002
collection "a mix of Amelie Poulain and French cancan."</TE>
<TE>   Other fashion critics noted the resemblance to Tautou of the first
model to hit the catwalk and Gaultier's homage to the cabarets and
plazas of postwar Montmartre. Radio and television shows frequently
sample Yann Tiersen's soundtrack, which has sold 2.5 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   And politicians of diverse ideologies have praised "Amelie's"
spirit of friendship and kindness, saying they wish the French would
emulate the movie's ideals.</TE>
<TE>   "France should be softer.... We need more tolerance, more
fraternity, a bit like the France of Amelie Poulain," said Francois
Fillon, regional leader of President Jacques Chirac's conservative
party, in a speech last year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, a Socialist, honored
"Amelie's" director and producer with a medal Wednesday. The mayor
hailed "a work that celebrates Paris with all the city's inner
humanity, energy, poetry and joy of living."</TE>
<TE>   Even Chirac held a private screening of "Amelie" at his elegant
official residence, the Palais de l'Elysee, attended by director
Jeunet ("Alien: Resurrection") and actress Tautou.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways,  Amelie-mania has been even more pronounced in
Japan. But it has been based more on commerce than poetry, warmth or
the character's benevolence. The Japanese love Amelie's clothes, bed,
bathroom and her apartment furnishings in general. Japanese clothing
chains have produced a line of fashionable accessories such as pins,
T-shirts and good-luck charms. Japanese travel agencies also offer
special "Amelie" packages that include tours of Montmartre and the
movie locations.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long time since a French comedy combined spectacular
critical and commercial success at home and abroad. The film has been
seen by more than 8 million people in France and 17 million
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Amelie" is set in 1997, but it creates a dreamlike Paris that is
not really Paris. There are no traffic jams, noise or pollution in
this vision of Montmartre as it might have looked half a century ago.
The soundtrack, dominated by the melancholic accordion rhythms of
postwar Paris, adds to an alchemy that freezes the story in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "'Amelie' is the Montmartre of the 1960s, where grass grew on the
sidewalks because there was not a lot of traffic," says Alain
Gauthier, a former Montmartre resident shopping at Chez Ali, a
grocery store that figures prominently in the film. "You can tell
from the story that it's happening now, but it has a look from the
old days."</TE>
<TE>   That too helps explain why "Amelie" immediately struck a chord
among the French, and particularly Parisians, who admit they tend to
be dour and reserved.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no sex, no violence or bad words," says cafe proprietor
Labbe. "I think people need this."</TE>
<TE>   Since the movie's release, Labbe has welcomed an onslaught of
tourists and journalists. Business has boomed. The managers of other
coffee shops and restaurants crammed into Montmartre's narrow streets
are expressing envy and irritation at all the tourists asking
directions to the Deux Moulins, where Jeunet's crew spent three weeks
shooting in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time the movie comes out somewhere in the world, we see the
tourists from that country arriving shortly afterward," Labbe says.</TE>
<TE>   Montmartre is not only crowds, tourists, bars and cars. It also
has quiet alleys, deserted squares, look-alike cul-de-sacs and narrow
steps bathed in sun or shadow. At the corner of a silent, steep
little street, you end up at the grocery Chez Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Although the store is only two blocks from the Place Pigalle,
infamous for prostitution and tawdry night life, Chez Ali occupies a
calm residential corner. It was chosen by Jeunet to house the only
really mean character in the story: Monsieur Collignon, the grocer.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Mdoughy, 46, the manager of the real store, is nothing like
the cold and mocking Collignon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese tourists have the best time when they come here," he
explains in a Moroccan accent. "I show them the photo album I put
together from the shooting with all the actors."</TE>
<TE>   Mdoughy is now a star in his neighborhood. Visitors regularly
question him about Tautou, Jamel Debbouze, who plays the grocer's
gentle assistant, and the other actors. They inquire if he inspired
the character of Collignon. He has given interviews to an assortment
of foreign journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like the garden gnome in the movie," he jokes. "I'm traveling
all around the globe."</TE>
<TE>   After the two-week visit of the film crew, Mdoughy decided to keep
his place almost as the director decorated it. He preserved the green
facade, the Maison Collignon sign and the layout. His outdoor stall
has become more refined than that of an average local grocery. The
produce is elegantly presented in wicker baskets, decorated with
plastic flowers and colorful fake fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the movie has changed his life, Mdoughy replies softly:
"It's like a flame, and I don't want it to go out."</TE>
<TE>   The movie's good cheer also changed the mood of the neighborhood,
Mdoughy says.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the place was losing its nostalgia, and the movie gave it
a new breath," he says. "It got people closer to each other. It's
quite magical, a happiness that invaded Montmartre."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the crowded and agitated Rue Lepic, Madame Labbe is
sterner and more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "The movie leaves a good feeling, that's for sure," she says. "But
it is in no way the reality. People haven't changed."</TE>
<TE>   That's sad news for Amelie fans crossing through the screen into
the real Paris. Around noon on a recent Friday, Romain Clarte, 25,
was taking pictures of the grocery. An aspiring French screenwriter
who has seen "Amelie" four times, he said he had taken advantage of a
quick business trip to Paris to visit the real-life movie set.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not only here for 'Amelie,' but as I was in Paris I thought
it'd be a good idea to come and see this place," he said. As much as
he liked the film, however, he said he saw little change in the
aggressive and unfriendly manner of many Parisian drivers and
pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Other than in Japan, Jeunet has resisted attempts to further
commercialize the "Amelie" phenomenon. You won't find "Amelie"
T-shirts, key chains or hats at souvenir shops in Montmartre. The
director rejected a proposed "Amelie" TV series offered by U.S.
producers as well as a request from the French Health Ministry to use
the title character in an informational campaign about abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Early this month,  the director  collected a Cesar award, the
French equivalent of the Academy Award, for best film. That added to
a string of honors for "Amelie," including Spain's Goya for best
European film and prizes from film festivals in Berlin, Toronto and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In Montmartre, the owner of Chez Ali aspires to more modest glory.
Mdoughy is working on ideas for a chocolate and an ice cream to be
named after Amelie.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to discuss this with Monsieur Jeunet," the grocer
explains. "But right now he is busy with the Oscars."</TE>

<LD>In the backstage lounge behind a black curtain, a tiny girl sits on a
white couch, her small legs crossed delicately as she answers a
reporter's questions. Eight-year-old Dakota Fanning, co-star with
Sean Penn of "I Am Sam," maintains the poise of a seasoned show-biz
pro. (Of her film role, she says: "It was just unbelievable working
with Sean. I just learned so much.")</LD>
<LD>   It's Saturday afternoon at the Shrine Auditorium in downtown Los
Angeles and Dakota has just finished rehearsing for the Screen Actors
Guild Awards (shown Sunday night on TNT). She's a presenter this year
and like all presenters, the actress is eligible for a visit to the
"Talent Retreat," a carefully decorated room where upscale
merchandisers compete to give away their goods to the celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   Dakota is wearing one of her gifts: a $1,500 sterling and gold
bracelet. She lists her other goodies: "I got some perfume ... I got
three dolls. I got a back massage and a watch and some
sunglasses....It's unbelievable!"</LD>
<TE>   People move in and out of the room all day. They sit on the bright
yellow couch, lean against the faux mink blanket, sip bottled water
and watch celebrities choose high-priced lingerie, watches,
bracelets, shoes and perfume from the tables. Uma Thurman was in
earlier. She hit every kiosk and rushed out because her baby was
waiting in the car. Ian McKellen and Kate Beckinsale also stopped by.
Ed Asner sat down in the spa area of the room for a paraffin hand
treatment. He joked with the woman kneading his shoulders and held up
two mittened hands. "You want me to take my shirt off?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors are chosen by the lounge's creator, Karen Wood, and pay up
to $5,000 for a spot inside the lounge and a salesperson to pitch
their wares to the stars. And if they're lucky, the result will be
"product placement" as a celebrity walks away wearing one of their
items. "They're really doing us more of a favor than we're doing for
them," says Britt Johnson, whose public relations company,
Mediaplacement, was representing a new perfume. "When they start
wearing stuff, it can be a national trend."</TE>

<TE>   Art and Charity in a Temple of Fashion</TE>
<TE>   Gallery owner Paul Kopeikin pushes his way through the crowd of
art enthusiasts, searching out his favorite photographs at the
reception on the women's clothing floor of the Barneys New York store
in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   He points to a black and white portrait of Andy Warhol in which
the artist wears his trademark turtleneck and white mop of hair,
staring directly at the camera. Kopeikin says he'd never been a huge
fan of the photographer Greg Gorman, but after seeing this shot, "I
kind of got Greg Gorman." It's a setting Warhol might appreciate:
Right next to the $1,800 portrait hangs a beige vinyl jacket priced
at $2,555.This Saturday night reception is sponsored by Focus on
AIDS, a nonprofit that supports AIDS research, care and education.
Photographers clamor to have their donated work featured in the
charity's high-profile fund-raising art auction, which takes place
about every 18 months. Among the featured photographers are David
LaChapelle, Bruce Weber, William Wegman, Herb Ritts, Wim Wenders and
Annie Leibovitz.</TE>
<TE>   The evening preview gives potential buyers a chance to view the
220 pieces before the auction Friday that organizers hope will raise
$300,000 for the charity.</TE>
<TE>   Kopeikin owns a contemporary art gallery in Los Angeles, and
several of his featured artists have donated work to the auction.
Moving on, he stops at a black and white photo of a man standing in
the shadows. The picture is titled "Hollywood Boulevard." The man
appears to be homeless. "How about that Diane Keaton?" he asks,
referring to the actress-photographer. "Isn't that disturbing?"</TE>
<TE>   Then he spots a black and white photo depicting a blank billboard
shot at night by Matthew Betcher. "I don't even know who that guy
is," he says. "But I think it's a great picture."</TE>
<TE>   Next to Douglas Kirkland's $1,700 close-up black-and-white of
Audrey Hepburn's young face hangs a black leather jacket for the same
price.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, guest Yvette Gilpin takes a break from the photos to scan
a row of skirts and pants. "I think it's a nice parallel," she said
of what art and fashion demand of viewers. "One isn't asking more
[than] the other."</TE>

<TE>   Celebrating a Film, Mourning an Event</TE>
<TE>   A month after Matthew Shepard's death in 1998, five members of the
Tectonic Theater Project arrived in Laramie, Wyo. Their project: to
interview residents about how the brutal murder of the 21-year-old
gay student changed their town and their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The theater group stayed for a year, and their conversations with
townspeople became the basis for a play and for an HBO movie, "The
Laramie Project," which premiered at the El Capitan Theater in
Hollywood on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   After the movie, some lingered in the lobby while others sought
refuge in the restroom, wiping away stripes of mascara.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad this movie had to be made," said a somber Camryn
Manheim, who stars in the movie, alongside Christina Ricci, Janeane
Garofalo and Peter Fonda, among others. Manheim was standing outside
the theater, getting ready for the after party. "It's strange," she
said about the celebrations, but added, "I guess it's a good time to
hug everybody."</TE>
<TE>   At the Sunset Room, few people were actually hugging. Roxy Music's
"More Than This" played in the background as guests in the dimly lit
restaurant talked about how moved they were by the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, people were back to business deals,
celebrity-spotting and joking about the amount of oysters, shrimp and
sushi some guests piled on their plates.</TE>
<TE>   In one booth, former Hollywood Reporter columnist George Christy
huddled with a friend. Nearby, Steve Buscemi ate his oysters.</TE>
<TE>   Ian McKellen (who wasn't in the movie) said the party was like a
wake. "After the funeral, you have the celebration of life."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hollywood felt like a long way from Laramie.</TE>

<LD>DEEP IN THE SHADE OF PARADISE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By John Dufresne</LD>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   416 pages; $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There's always at least two stories, the one you set out to tell
and the one you discover along the way; the one you know about, the
one you don't," says the narrator in John Dufresne's absolute lark of
a novel, "Deep in the Shade of Paradise," a sequel to his 1994 debut
"Louisiana Power &amp; Light."</TE>
<TE>   Readers who embark on this bizarre, hilarious and totally hypnotic
journey may never be sure which of the stories Dufresne manages to
tell, but by the time they're knee-deep in the swamp of his
imagination, they won't give much of a hoot either way.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep in the Shade of Paradise" takes on the premise of
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in pungent Cajun-Creole
fashion. Set in the Louisiana town of Shiver-de-Freeze--a corruption
of the French cheval de frise--on the family plantation of Paradise,
the stage is set for the wedding of Ariane Thevenot and Grisham
Loudermilk.</TE>
<TE>   All of the family have gathered, including Boudou Fontana (first
name rhymes with "Who do"). The boy is the last of the Fontana clan,
all of whom have been victims of a persistent hex, a curse Boudou
hopes to end. So well-known, in fact, is the curse that the local
museum features a display of objects related to the demise of the
Fontana lineage.</TE>
<TE>   Boudou's great-uncle Royce Birdsong, meanwhile, is suffering from
Alzheimer's; Boudou, who has a photographic memory, takes over the
job of remembering for Royce.</TE>
<TE>   As pre-wedding festivities get underway, Royce's bachelor son
Adlai falls in love with the bride-to-be and tries to change the
course of the planned nuptials, just as the groom is seducing Miranda
Ferry in her Airstream trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this quirky caprice of a tale, oddball characters mill
around, shedding a surreal light on such themes as the purpose of
memory, the importance of family, the difficulties of love, the
nonsense of destiny and the role of fidelity.</TE>
<TE>   There's Tous-les-Deux, conjoined female twins who develop a crush
on Boudou; the priest who's in love with the bride-to-be's mother and
rethinking his commitment to celibacy; Underwood Abdelnour, the
Lecture Man, who will come to your gathering and liven things up with
the topic of your choice, including "If Immanuel Kant, then Genghis
Khan"; Alvin Lee, second cousin to Boudou, a polygamous Southern
preacher whose congregation dresses in early 1970s tie-dye, Nehru
jackets and love beads and listens to Marvin Gaye on portable
eight-track players; and Earlene deBastrop Fontana, Boudou's
country-songwriting mother, who can't get over the loss of her
husband, Billy Wayne Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Wayne died as part of the Fontana curse on the day Boudou
was conceived. Adding to this lineup are scores of walk-on characters
who keep readers on their feet and in the thrall of the eccentric
narrative, if not exactly sure where (or why) things are unfolding as
they are.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all these comings and goings, we're treated to off-the-wall
narrator ponderings on philosophy, great books and linguistic theory,
along with the odd slam on the New York literary establishment and
ivory-tower academics. There's lots of "Jesus Saved Me, Amen!" talk,
which Dufresne pushes to its sidesplitting limit.</TE>
<TE>   (One religious convention features snake-handling congregants,
spiritually inspired messages for answering machines and a Witness
Panty Hose booth).</TE>
<TE>   Many nods to the discerning reader are buried amid this hoopla,
such as when Adlai tries to convince Ariane to elope with him: "Sure
we'll have a lot of explaining to do," he tells her, "but the only
people that really matter are kin, and blood is thicker than
irony...." Dufresne is not afraid to use postmodern strategies to get
his story across, and he leans heavily on the David Foster Wallace
tradition of lengthy end notes to give readers off-kilter pieces of
the tale that don't quite fit in this far-from-straightforward
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Though Dufresne's work has been compared to that of William
Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor and other Southern denizens, don't take
the similarities too seriously. This is not the kind of highbrow
literature up for discussion in college classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   His work is closer to the over-the-top philosophical antics of Tom
Robbins than anything you'd encounter in an American literature
course.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, though, that is to Dufresne's benefit. "Deep in the
Shade of Paradise" is a book that's perfect for losing yourself in,
for drifting off and forgetting all about the paperwork you need to
gather for tax-filing day, the chores around the house calling for
your attention and the grass you're supposed to be mowing.</TE>
<TE>   This is one to sweep you away to a gloriously off-center notion of
paradise.</TE>

<HD>Happy 90th Birthday, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.</HD>

<LD>Today is the 90th anniversary of the founding of Girl Scouts of the
United States of America. It all began after Juliette Gordon Low met
with her cousin, Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Boy Scouts
and Girl Guides in England. A year later, Low called a friend to say,
"I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all America, and
all the world, and we're going to start it tonight." On March 12,
1912, Low gathered 18 girls in Savannah, Ga., for the first Girl
Scout meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Juliette Gordon Low, known by her friends as "Daisy," believed
that all girls should have the opportunity to develop "physically,
mentally and spiritually." Her goal was to bring girls out of their
home environments and into community service and the outdoors. She
planned a program where girls could learn self-reliance, self-respect
and self-worth.</LD>
<LD>   In the past 90 years Girl Scouting has helped launch women leaders
in all fields, including education, government, arts, science, sports
and business. Some examples include Olympian track star Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, Eileen Collins, the first female space shuttle
commander, and two-thirds of the women currently in the U.S.
Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Today there are 2.8 million Girl Scouts, ages 5 to 17, and nearly
1 million adult members. All are part of a worldwide family of 10
million girls and adults in 140 countries through membership in the
World Assn. of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. It is an organization
dedicated totally to girls, where they can find fun, friends and a
foundation of values and skills to improve themselves and the world
around them.</TE>

<HD>Exploring Latin Fashion in the Real World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA CRITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It takes more than a map to understand Latin American fashion. It is
about geography, culture and even deeply held religious beliefs. And
if it's a commercial success, it's also about capturing the attention
of New York, Milan and Paris fashion insiders who are literally a
world away from where the design was born.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a myth that everything Latin American is in hot tropical
colors, but they don't exist in everyday fashion," says Kimberly
Randall, a curator of a new exhibit at the Museum at the Fashion
Institute of Technology called "Latin American Fashion: Exploring
Identities on the New York Runway."</LD>
<LD>   The clothing of carnaval and celebrations is what is seen most
often in the United States, that is not what the woman who is
shopping in Mexico City or Sao Paulo, Brazil, is wearing, Randall
says.</LD>
<TE>   Looking at the garments for the show, co-curator Cathy Maguire
reports seeing "a fair amount of white and black with a smattering of
red, turquoise and purple."</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis is on cut, not printed fabrics.</TE>
<TE>   Randall and Maguire, graduate students at FIT, separated 80 pieces
of real-life clothing and accessories by more than 24 Latin American
designers into categories for the exhibit, which runs through April
13.</TE>
<TE>   They include quinceanera, a girl's 15th birthday celebration;
architecture; Catholicism; the mantilla, a lace scarf typically worn
as a head covering or cape; surrealism; seduction and dance.</TE>
<TE>   "What we wanted to present is the diversity of such a large
region," explains Maguire.</TE>
<TE>   For example, though almost all Belgian designers are influenced by
their similar experiences in Antwerp, Latin American designers lead
vastly different lives and come from different sets of values and
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Some designers are heavily influenced by their heritage, others by
their travels, and others look to their stylish relatives, says
Randall.</TE>
<TE>   But there is at least one consistency, according to Oscar de la
Renta, who was born in the Dominican Republic and is now one of New
York's most famous names in fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latin American woman is a woman who has always felt strongly
about her femininity--and that has influenced my designs," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin American women--they love to be flirtatious in a slinky
dress, going dancing," agrees shoe designer Edmundo Castillo, who was
born and raised in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   "The first and foremost thing about their shoes is they have to be
sexy," says Castillo, who worked for Donna Karan before launching his
own line in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo and De la Renta say their childhoods, when they were
surrounded by several sisters, gave them insight into what Latin
American--and women all over the world--really want in their
wardrobes.</TE>
<TE>   De la Renta says his collections now are mostly seen through his
"international eye," which was trained while he worked in both Spain
and Paris before coming to New York 35 years ago, but his Latin
American heritage is evident in his use of color and light.</TE>
<TE>   "Light is important," he explains. "The tropics are bright, the
sunsets are dramatic.... I've never done an all-black collection, and
my collections are not murky. I like light and lively clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Jimenez, a Mexican American, sees Latin American fashion
from a different vantage point.</TE>
<TE>   She says the Chicano art movement--which her father was heavily
involved with when Jimenez was a child growing up in Texas--is her
greatest source of inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The very spiritual art, society and culture that surrounded her
"brought the sacred into everyday life," says Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   She also says that she considers herself a Latina but she can't
quite say where from.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely represent part of the Latin community, but I'm the
part of the community who is still trying to figure out where I fit
in."</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez doesn't speak Spanish, but, she adds, her design
sensibility comes from her Mexican grandmother who taught her about
clothes during "sewing circles" at a local church.</TE>
<TE>   "I always tie in with symbolism and mysticism in my clothes and
art," she says.</TE>
<TE>   One of Jimenez's designs featured in the FIT exhibit falls into
the surrealism category: a denim shirt covered in gold leaf that
leaves a trail of gold flecks.</TE>
<TE>   De la Renta's pieces on display include a long black velvet dress
with a full puffed sleeve that the curators see as influenced by
Catholicism, and a colorful "dance dress" based on fringed tango
shawls.</TE>
<TE>   The dresses for quinceanera (called quince in Cuba and "pinky" in
Puerto Rico) are sometimes as elaborate as wedding gowns, says
Maguire.</TE>
<TE>   They traditionally have a full skirt, a fitted bodice, puff
sleeves and lace embellishment.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Herrera's version displayed at the museum has an
exaggerated puff sleeve, and Mark Montano's was inspired by an Edgar
Degas ballerina painting.</TE>
<TE>   Architectural garments by Latin American designers are tailored
but have an unusual twist, according to Randall, who cited Narciso
Rodriguez's seemingly white, sleeveless, column dress--which has an
open back and crisscross straps underneath the bodice. Maguire notes
that Venezulan designer Angel Sanchez, whose work is included in the
exhibit, is a trained architect.</TE>
<TE>   Catholicism is seen through the restraint in design and the
influence of 16th and 17th century paintings, says Randall.</TE>
<TE>   Seduction is best demonstrated by Isabel Toledo's red lace dress
with a stole and Rodriguez's "liquid copper" sequin dress, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   These themes are hardly fads of fashion.</TE>
<TE>   They can be seen throughout Latin American fashion of this
century, last century and even before, so maybe there is some
constancy, after all.</TE>

<KH>Fall 2002/PARIS COLLECTIONS</KH>
<HD>Flying Colors</HD>
<DH>Retailers respond to the few upbeat hues amid the funereal
tones on the runways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>Paris</DL>
<LD>PARIS--The global gloom has settled on fashion designers in the City
of Light. So many have embraced dark, somber colors and saggy
silhouettes that the occasional colorful and joyous collection seems
almost manic by comparison.</LD>
<LD>   As the fall collections got underway Thursday, the funereal black
ensembles, swooping dark coats and militaristic details continued the
sober theme that took root weeks ago in New York with, for example,
the all-black Ralph Lauren collection. That dark feeling was
reflected here in the clothes of Yohji Yamamoto, Ennio Capasa for
Costume National and even Michael Kors for Celine.</LD>
<LD>   Timing is also heightening the contrast: These heavy-spirited fall
previews are taking place just as the ruffled and frilly spring
collections are arriving in stores. Retailers and editors are
studying closely the fall trends of skirt suits, scarves, bomber
jackets, boots and big coats for an acceptable middle ground that
offers creativity, an upbeat mood and a reason to shop.</LD>
<TE>   Though edgy fashionistas may continue with their black-loving,
dour ways, some stores that rely on a broader customer base are
planning a counter-strategy. "All-black clothes for the New York
customer--or the American customer--after Sept. 11 are not going to
make it," said Bloomingdale's fashion chief Kalman Ruttenstein. He
and Neiman Marcus executives said colorful, uplifting clothes are
selling best. Bloomingdale's New York, Florida and Century City
stores will open Kaleidoscope boutiques filled with colorful
sweaters, T-shirts and accessories to brighten the fall season.</TE>
<TE>   More than ever, the iconoclast designers who operate outside of
fashion's trend dictates have delivered the perfectly quirky, more
upbeat clothes that reflect these odd times. More like conceptual
artists than dressmakers, Dutch designers Viktor &amp; Rolf magically
transformed the meaning of clothes by employing cinema's blue-screen
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a model wore a sweeping evening coat and dress, tasseled
snakeskin boots or a patchworked satin blouse, their common royal
blue color enabled them to act as screens for video projections. A
woman could wear a glamorous gown full of snobbish class
associations, but she could change the meaning by becoming a human
screen for a movie about anything--Egypt's pyramids, mountain scenery
or fish, as the designers demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it was to celebrate the imagination," said Viktor
Horsting. For the finale, a model marched out in a military jacket
with cloth cylinders resembling dynamite sticks. She was transformed
from a scary suicide bomber when the video beam erased details of the
clothes with images of a cityscape.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, clothing can gain or lose power when its context
changes. Perhaps that's why John Galliano's Christian Dior collection
redefined "ethnic" with his delightful mix of Peruvian and Etruscan
warrior helmets, rustic Indian and Eskimo moccasin boots and a
continuous, elegant blur of National Geographic folkloric costume
references. Galliano's boldness pushed Dior clearly into a new era
with his luxuriously decorated leather or denim pants, full skirts
encrusted with ethnic embroidery and luxurious hand-knitted cardigan
coats.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a wonderfully eclectic collection," said Robert Burke,
senior vice president of fashion direction at Bergdorf Goodman, "but
it was also a very understandable collection." Galliano successfully
abandoned his usual tortured styling and also refined the peasant
theme that's been in fashion this year.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar vein, Hussein Chalayan presented the folkloric
fashion equivalent of a bell curve on the runway. He started and
ended with the same model in the full regalia of Eastern Turkey's
ethnic costume and gradually subtracted, then added, decorative
elements. The midpoint? A classic black knee-length coat. The
deviations? Scraps affixed like jagged lace on a distressed leather
skirt, cloth harnesses cinching dresses, and bits of bright
embroidery on vests, dresses or coats.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, Chalayan was taken aback at the suggestion that the
clothes were complicated, and he was mute when asked to describe the
pattern for one of his intricately patched, pieced and harnessed
looks. He proved on the runway, however, that the seemingly random
construction can be repeated: He showed the same complex design, but
in two dresses in different colors.</TE>
<TE>   The best collections here have come from designers who are
embracing their own essence. Jean-Paul Gaultier, Dries Van Noten and
Karl Lagerfeld showed strong collections that included their
recognizable but freshened signatures. Gaultier's models shed their
perfectly, classically tailored coats, motorcycle jackets and pea
coats and hung them on a rotating dry cleaner's rack that conveyed
hangers along the runway. Gaultier said he employed the clever idea
to help show what's underneath the veil of our coats.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he illustrated how a woman can be in command of
her own style. She can add arm warmers, tailcoats, mesh T-shirts or
snug fur vests to cinch a full dress, or add formality or funkiness
to a simple white shirt and pants. With artist Christo as an
inspiration, Gaultier wound scarves into ropes and wrapped skirts,
necks, heads, coats and more with them. "The collection is about
everything that is packaging," the designer said backstage. These are
unfussy, easy-to-assemble packages, too, as the quick, on-stage
changes demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Lagerfeld poured into his namesake Lagerfeld Gallery his
signature sleek and small-shouldered silhouette, wispy chiffon
dresses (a la Chanel) and the kind of weightless and woven fur coats
he perfected at Fendi. With glittery T-shirts, skirts or boleros as
accompaniment, the collection could have seemed precious had he not
injected real-life styling with plenty of edgy denim jeans made in
collaboration with Diesel.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing his serious Belgian roots, Van Noten presented a
neutral-colored collection of gray, black or olive oversized
sweaters, jackets and dresses. His talent was enlivening those safe
and sometimes dour basics by wrapping them in a gorgeously
embellished long scarf or topping them with a coat or sweater made
fantastic by heavy floral embroidery, dramatic volume or the charm of
hand-knitted flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   Though Michael Kors and Ennio Capasa have always created sleek,
classic clothes, their collections seemed unduly repressed. Capasa's
mostly black Costume National collection suffered from a lackluster
presentation that betrayed the timeless beauty in his urban wardrobe:
lean pants, great leather jackets and a sexy, simple top. In the
light of day this fall, Capasa fans may well relish the understated
fun of a furry bomber with snap-apart sleeves, a long fuzzy cardigan
embellished with a sparkling medallion, or pinstripes made of gold
piping on a tailored black velvet jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Kors, a New Yorker who always seems chipper and once made a Celine
safari collection seem like a fun lark, brought a downbeat state of
mind to the French collection. In his mix of soft and hard, hard won.
Distressed leathers, jagged zippers on aviator pants, rugged bomber
jackets and colors of black, wine, moss and gunmetal overwhelmed the
softer pieces. His real achievement was making the '70s shirt
jackets, platform boots and shirts under sweaters (think Lauren
Hutton) look modern, not like retro retreads.</TE>
<TE>   The new sobriety can be overwhelming. Junya Watanabe, in a homage
to Yohji Yamamoto's early work, showed only black or gray holey,
mouse-eaten slipdresses and skirt suits. Though his black patchworked
coats were graceful and romantic, the idea of tattered, ravaged
clothing leaves a sour taste.</TE>
<TE>   Even the masterful Yamamoto fell under the weight of a collection
that L.A. retailer Tommy Perse called "heavy," in spirit and in
fabric. The padded gray mechanic's jackets worn with backward ball
caps were odd enough to call Gomer Yamamoto of Mayberry. The hugely
oversized blazers with sagging shoulder pads seemed sad, more so on
the waifish models with dirty faces and ashen hair. Not all hope was
lost: Suddenly, as Led Zeppelin's "Good Times, Bad Times" boomed,
some of the same sorry silhouettes appeared with angel wings
stenciled on the back of bomber jackets or long coats.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Yamamoto is an optimist, after all. Maybe those wings
weren't from angels whisking us up to heaven after death, but from
guardian angels telling us to have hope. Sadness lasts only as long
as we let it. Perhaps it is time to let color and happiness into our
lives.</TE>

<LD>There wasn't much new in the latest scathing report on the
performance of Los Angeles County's giant system of foster care:</LD>
<LD>   The county fails to move children "promptly" through the system
and back to their families or into adoptive homes. Some foster
families are paid too much and some too little, because of slipshod
methods of tracking funds. A growing backlog of kids available for
adoption is costing the county millions in federal funds. Records are
in such disarray, social workers lose track of the kids they're
supposed to be watching.</LD>
<LD>   The charges, though troubling, are all complaints we've heard
before. The audit, released last week by state Controller Kathleen
Connell, is simply the most recent in a long list of investigations
and studies that make it clear our foster care system--the nation's
largest, with 53,000 children under its control--is doing an
inadequate job of protecting kids.</LD>
<TE>   Connell's office says she initiated the audit to see if the
county's Department of Children and Family Services was spending
state money properly, after earlier reports found the agency was
having trouble keeping track of its wards. California could be
assessed up to $5 million in penalties when federal officials review
the Los Angeles County operation this fall, Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The controller stepped in because these mistakes can be very
costly if they're not corrected by then," said Lisa Casalegno,
Connell's press deputy.</TE>
<TE>   But some legislators and child-welfare officials are grumbling
that the audit is little more than a grab for attention by a
politically savvy elected official who will be turned out of office
by term limits this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me that there's not a lot of 'there' there,"
said Hilary McLean, press deputy for Gov. Gray Davis. "The governor's
already demonstrating a strong leadership role on these issues. These
are, after all, some of our state's most vulnerable children."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, they are ... which would make it all the more tragic if
the issue of what happens to them, and their families, becomes
another political football.</TE>
<TE>   This was going to be the year for foster care. Three hundred
million dollars had been set aside to reform the system and remedy
its most glaring ills. A package of legislative fixes would have cut
caseloads, increased incentives for foster families, cut hurdles for
adoptive families and provided help for struggling families trying to
keep their kids out of foster care.</TE>
<TE>   But the cure was whittled to a $30 million Band-Aid when the
state's budget deficit set in, and Los Angeles County was left to
limp along with too many kids, too few social workers and too little
support for its fledgling commitment to change.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a local investigative panel pronounced our system
in such disarray, that "Los Angeles County lacks the ability to
protect its foster children from re-abuse and re-neglect." In other
words, children faced about the same level of peril in foster care
that they'd faced in the homes they had been rescued from.</TE>
<TE>   Department director Anita Bock, who came on board just one month
before that report, has talked a good game of change. But few
improvements seem to have taken place. A $22-million program to keep
families together and children out of foster care was so ineffective
and poorly managed that only a handful of families were able to get
help. Last month, an appellate court stepped in to order social
workers to stop skipping monthly visits with their wards. And
MacLaren Hall, the county shelter for abused and neglected children,
is still characterized by its critics as a house of horrors.</TE>
<TE>   Bock says the agency is making progress, and she worries that the
controller's salvo will reinforce the notion that the foster care
system is a shambles, a lost cause with problems too massive to
solve.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made a great deal of progress in the last few years, and
it's somewhat of a tragedy that people continue to define the system
by its failures," Bock said, after reviewing the report. "There are
still many areas that need a substantial amount of reform, but this
generalized anecdotal rhetoric about everything being in crisis isn't
doing anybody any good."</TE>
<TE>   My telephone call to Bock on Friday caught her in the midst of
reviewing one family's case--one among many that land on her desk
because of complaints or challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the family approaches my office, unhappy with a
decision that's been made. Sometimes it's the social worker,
sometimes the court," Bock said. "I read the reports, meet with the
family ... anything to try to determine what is truly in the best
interests of the child. Because it's a mistake to presume our agency
always acts in good faith. Every case is different, every family is
different, every situation is different. And at the end of the day,
it's always a judgment call."</TE>
<TE>   Bock has been under pressure on several fronts to improve her
department's performance. Next week, she is due to answer to the
county Board of Supervisors on the slow pace of planned reforms.</TE>
<TE>   She says her department's statistics paint a different picture
than Connell's report: The number of deaths in foster care is
decreasing, social worker caseloads have fallen, and the number of
children taken from their parents and placed in foster care is down.
"I think we're overall on the right path," she said. "Reform is
difficult and slow, and this sort of nuclear rhetoric doesn't help at
all."</TE>
<TE>   But Bock must also realize that the stakes are high precisely
because the work her agency does--taking children away, giving them
back, shuffling them among from foster homes--produces nuclear
explosions every day, in hundreds of families and homes.</TE>

<HD>Do You Pinch on St. Pat's?</HD>
<DH>Part 2: The story so far: To find out about pinching on St.
Patrick's Day, a sixth-grade class is writing letters to other states
asking how they celebrate the day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTY MARTENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sean approached Miss Baxter's desk. "I don't want to write a letter
to any of the 50 states," he said. "I want to write a letter to
Ireland and find out what they do and see if they ever heard of
pinching for not wearing green on St. Patrick's Day."</LD>
<LD>   "That's a good idea," Miss Baxter answered. "We'll all be anxious
to hear what they have to say."</LD>
<LD>   "Let me share what I read in the newspaper yesterday," Kate said.
"In Dublin they have green ice cream and green cotton candy on St.
Patrick's Day. Let's write a letter to our PTA and suggest they make
green cotton candy on St. Patrick's Day and sell it to the kids.
They'd make a big profit. And they're always looking for ways to
raise money. I know. My mom's the treasurer."</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah!" echoed the class.</TE>
<TE>   On April 1 the school secretary entered the classroom with her
hands behind her back. "Guess what? I've got a surprise for you."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, sure. We know. April Fool!" everyone shouted.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary waved a thick brown envelope. "No April Fool here."
She laughed.</TE>
<TE>   The envelope was addressed to Melissa. It was from Hopkinsville,
Ky. A whole class had written. The answer puzzled the sixth-graders.
In one letter a person said, "Yes, we pinch," and the next one said,
"No."</TE>
<TE>   Some writers mentioned they had attended school elsewhere before
moving to Kentucky. A pupil who went to school in Germany when his
dad was stationed there said, "We threw eggs at people who didn't
wear green."</TE>
<TE>   "In Alaska we threw people in the snow if they forgot to wear
green," another wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we kiss people who don't wear green," a letter said.</TE>
<TE>   A boy wrote, "I asked another class we met on our field trip to
Tennessee and found out they don't pinch."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: How many kids from other states will answer their
letters?</TE>

<LD>With friends like these: A car thief in Paramount dropped a cell
phone while being chased by L.A. County sheriff's deputies. He got
away, but a deputy retrieved the phone. It rang a few minutes later
and the deputy answered it.</LD>
<LD>   What happened next, according to the city's monthly newsletter,
sounded like something out of a Joseph Wambaugh novel.</LD>
<LD>   Posing as the suspect, the deputy told the cell phone caller that
he was hiding from the cops.</LD>
<TE>   The caller said, "Come here, we'll hide you."</TE>
<TE>   The deputy said he couldn't remember the address.</TE>
<TE>   The thief's good buddy gave it to him.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives went to the residence, got the name of the thief and
put a warrant out for his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hardly big enough for one SUV: As you may have read in Saturday's
Times, Chinese real estate mogul Zhang Bo has built a housing
development called Orange County outside Beijing. It's the kind of
gated, master-planned community of luxury homes that Bo had seen on a
tour of California's Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   I did spot something different about the Chinese version, though
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   It has a one-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back to California's Orange County: The police log of the Rancho
Santa Margarita News said: "A Porsche was reported abandoned after
sitting in the same place on La Flauta for four days."</TE>
<TE>   That's Rancho Santa Margarita for you. In the neighborhood where I
grew up, we wouldn't have reported an abandoned Porsche. We'd have
been honored to have it parked on our street.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This feature won't be master-planned: Bob Thomas of Newport Beach
noticed a mansion evidently being offered by someone with a couple of
teenagers in the family (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who says Southern California has no history? Jeff Carruthers of
Pomona spotted an ad for a house that is old enough to qualify as a

<HD>Despite All, Parks Is Best for the City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED DAVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn got one thing right: Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks is much too stubborn. So Parks isn't perfect. But he's the best
choice to lead the Los Angeles Police Department for the next five
years.</LD>
<LD>   As a former chief of the LAPD myself, I'd like to make a case for
Parks.</LD>
<LD>   He's a man of high integrity. Don't sell that point short. The
question of whether Los Angeles can hold on to those values if Parks
goes is a considerable one. A city largely free of corruption is not
a given. It's produced by standing above compromising relationships
and by vigilance.</LD>
<TE>   Parks himself worries that the scandals of early 20th century Los
Angeles could return if the department allowed itself to be enmeshed
in politics. That wariness is one reason Parks chooses not to be "a
good listener."</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League helped muscle the previous chief out
the door. If it should do the same to Parks, its self-serving,
money-powered agenda would dominate the law enforcement and political
landscape. That must not happen.</TE>
<TE>   The department Parks leads keeps making gains against
discriminatory behavior. From what I can tell, it now treats every
group with a reasonable degree of fairness. If there are
imperfections in policing, they mostly don't arise out of a climate
of prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor overseeing compliance with the federal consent decree
gives the LAPD very good marks for its efforts so far.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has installed and enforces a complaint system that puts the
city at the forefront in well-disciplined policing. For Los Angeles,
given its history, that's a fundamental need, not an option. Some of
the uproar from the Police Protective League--disguised as claims of
"low morale"--shows how much of an impact his disciplinary system has
had.</TE>
<TE>   The police union does have a valid point, though. There's a
threshold at which things can descend into pettiness, where mountains
are made of molehills. Discipline needs to be tempered with wisdom
and a sense of proportion.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers tend to minimize what Parks has accomplished with the
complaint system. But why? It's what they demanded. It neither sells
out the citizen nor undercuts the cop. Have they studied what he has
built? Do they really think this system is small potatoes?</TE>
<TE>   This brings up the subject of the criteria set by the Police
Commission for judging Parks. Are the members giving him the bum's
rush? Parks' responsibility, above all, has been to shape a
department that all residents can depend on and trust. Anyone who
doesn't realize that this needs to be his guiding mission wasn't
paying attention in the 1990s. Parks has put his heart and soul into
that task.</TE>
<TE>   If reappointed, can Parks do better? Sure. For one thing, it may
be time for some of the greatest, most self-effacing leadership of
Parks' career: Break out the peace pipe with the Police Protective
League.</TE>
<TE>   However strained relationships are now, Parks and the league have
to cooperate to make LAPD employment become a goal again for young
officers and recruits. Working hours have been radically changed;
other morale issues can be worked on to boost retention and
recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   Parks does need to become a better communicator with the public,
city officials and his own force. Bernard, become a listener. And
what's wrong with meeting with the LAPD's inspector general from time
to time?</TE>
<TE>   It gnaws at me that Parks and others didn't do a more satisfying
job of bringing the Ramparts Division investigation to a close. We
still haven't gotten to the roots of what happened. This can't be
allowed to stand as a raw sore.</TE>
<TE>   Still, overall, Parks is terrific, always has been. He's a great
chief, always will be.</TE>

<LD>We are not lawyers or social workers. We are actresses and mothers
who care enough to speak out against the great injustices being
inflicted on the more than 50,000 children living in the Los Angeles
County foster care system.</LD>
<LD>   These include children who are moved from home to home, sometimes
having up to 15 placements, with social workers changing almost as
often; children sent to foster homes that have been deemed dangerous
by some agencies and not by others; children repeatedly immunized or
unknowingly given different medications by different doctors.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. County recently settled lawsuits for $4 million involving a
foster child who was overmedicated with phenobarbital, Xanax, Prozac
and three other psychotropic drugs. As a result, the child fell into
a coma and suffered brain and liver damage.</LD>
<TE>   Poor tracking of children and the inadequate sharing of
information within the system has had devastating results. In one of
the most tragic incidents, an 11-month-old, Danzel Bailey, starved to
death while under the Department of Children and Family Services'
watch.</TE>
<TE>   The Alliance for Children's Rights, a nonprofit children's
advocacy group, recently won a court battle against the Department of
Children and Family Services, forcing social workers to visit
children on a monthly basis--something they were already mandated to
do. If case workers want to skip a visit, they will have to convince
a judge that their absence does not violate the best interests of the
foster child. It has taken two years at an untold cost to taxpayers
for this finding to be made.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the alliance argued that the best interests of
the child should always be paramount. The county argued, however,
that its discretionary powers should be paramount and that to rely
solely on the best interests of the child would "lead to absurd
results."</TE>
<TE>   This leads us to ask two questions: First, if the Department of
Children and Family Services is not serving the best interests of the
child, whose interests is it serving? Second, why would a department
whose sole purpose is to protect the safety and welfare of children
take this position?</TE>
<TE>   This lawsuit was a golden opportunity for Anita Bock, the director
of the department, to demonstrate leadership and improve the services
for children and families in her care. Instead, she chose to fight
for the right for her department to visit or not visit children at
its own discretion. It is obvious that she feels that her department
does not need to be held accountable to anyone but itself.</TE>
<TE>   She is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, although the county has lost at the trial and appellate
levels, it plans to keep fighting. Only two supervisors, Mike
Antonovich and Zev Yaraslovsky, have consistently supported
preserving the best interests of our children. Why are taxpayer
dollars being used for high-priced lawyers to oppose the best
interests of children?</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles foster care system is the largest in the country,
and the journey through it for many children is a treacherous one. We
cannot fathom why the Department of Children and Family Services has
been allowed to hold so tightly to a system that is irrefutably
broken rather than spearheading changes that would serve the
interests of the children they are supposed to protect.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever motives are at play, ask in the strongest terms that the
Board of Supervisors make the welfare of children as high a priority
as it makes new roads. It is time for board members to demand that
the department properly do its job and take responsibility for these
children as the law demands. And to once and for all protect their
fragile and promising lives.</TE>

<LD>Of course the Pentagon has scenarios for nuking other countries.
That's what generals are supposed to do. When they aren't fighting,
they're planning ahead to the next fight.</LD>
<LD>   But if, as the 19th century Prussian military strategist Karl von
Clausewitz observed, "war is the continuation of politics by other
means," then come the real questions: What is the political end the
Bush administration is seeking? Will continuing on to war achieve
that end?</LD>
<LD>   So far, the Bush team is hanging tough, even though such military
scenario-izing is scarifying to the world, and maybe destabilizing to
some allies. The Nuclear Posture Review, revealed first in the Los
Angeles Times, lays out hypothetical circumstances for nuclear
strikes against China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Russia and
Syria. But no doubt if those countries had a freer press, their war
plans against the U.S. would be exposed too.</LD>
<TE>   There's nothing new about such war planning. The late Herman Kahn
was one of many military think-tankers who made a career out of
armchair-strategizing about deterrence and overkill. He published two
books, "On Thermonuclear War" and "Thinking About the Unthinkable."
In one exercise, he outlined 44 levels of military escalation, from
"ostensible crisis" to "barely nuclear war" to "justifiable
counterforce attack." So eager was Kahn for precision that he even
half-seriously suggested the creation of a computer-controlled
"doomsday machine" that would eliminate the unreliable human factor
in nuclear war fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, the politicians never surrendered to such Strangelovian
suggestions, preferring to keep a human finger hovering just above
the nuclear button all through the Cold War. Perhaps the political
class remembered that World War I started in part because politicians
surrendered their authority to a simpler technology--the technology
of railroad-based mobilization. The issue in 1914 was getting one's
troops to the frontier before the enemy. In those days, that meant
relying on intricate but inflexible railway schedules to move men and
materiel to the battle zone.</TE>
<TE>   As the Oxford historian Niall Ferguson argues in his 1998 book,
"The Pity of War: Explaining World War I," war mobilization created
its own war momentum. The Russian army, for example, knew that it
would be the slowest to mobilize, so its generals wanted to be the
first to mobilize. Indeed, once the order to gear up for war was
made, the Russian chief of staff said that he would destroy his
telephone so that he could not receive a countermanding order. And
so, Ferguson wrote, "war by timetable" commenced, and 10 million men
died.</TE>
<TE>   Today, George W. Bush faces the challenge of sticking to his
reported plan of removing Saddam Hussein even as he seeks to tamp
down brush fires in Afghanistan and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming for the moment that Bush succeeds in all three of these
missions, longer-term questions will remain. Specifically, how will
the rest of the world react to these latest usages and considered
usages of American strength, both conventional and nuclear?</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, countries facing an American threat, real or imagined,
face a choice: They can plan to accommodate, or they can plan to
retaliate. And as the same Nuclear Posture Review reveals, the
potential threat to the U.S. goes beyond the countries on the nuclear
hit list. In all, 12 other nations have nuclear weapons programs, 18
have ballistic missiles, 13 have biological weapons and 16 have
chemical weapons. No doubt the U.S. would be better off if these
programs disappeared, but the problem with war-strategizing and
deadly weaponizing is that every military, worldwide, can get into
the grim game.</TE>
<TE>   In response, U.S. military planners will no doubt develop more
scenarios, planning tit for tat. That's necessary, but it's not
sufficient. In the words of Georges Clemenceau, who led France to a
Pyrrhic victory in WWI: War is too important to be left to generals.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the task for Bush: He must demonstrate to a skeptical world
that plans for winning wars today are in fact a plan for keeping the
peace tomorrow. If he fails, then, with apologies to Clausewitz,
politics will continue on into war, and then on to still more war.</TE>

<LD>When in doubt, nuke 'em.</LD>
<LD>   The news that the Pentagon had secret contingency plans to fight
terrorism with nuclear weapons has the marks not of considered
military doctrine but rather of an infantile tantrum born of the Bush
administration's frustration in making good on its overblown promise
to end the terrorist scourge.</LD>
<LD>   There is desperation in the air; the giant that is America feels
humbled by the Lilliputian terrorists who have not been brought fully
to account. There still is not a clear line of command connecting the
hijackers with Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders whom the president has
yet to capture, "dead or alive."</LD>
<TE>   Neither has there been progress on the source of the anthrax that
killed five people and crippled the U.S. Postal Service, except the
disconcerting evidence that this particular evil seems to be
home-grown.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear weapons also are a made-in-the-U.S.A. product, and given
that we are the only nation to have used them, one would expect that
we would have a special responsibility to eschew their future use.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the administration's plan not only targets the three
"axis of evil" nations--Iran, Iraq and North Korea--but Syria, Libya,
Russia and China as well.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the absurdity: We risk escalating a worldwide nuclear
arms race to nuke a shadow terrorist enemy whose most effective
military action to date was begun with box cutters. Clearly, that
threat could have been met best by taking the modest steps of
maintaining armed air marshals on civilian planes and employing
better-trained airport security guards.</TE>
<TE>   Nuking our own or anyone else's airports would not have saved the
World Trade Center and the human beings who were there Sept. 11. The
hijackers succeeded because our $30-billion-a-year intelligence
apparatus failed to perform and we consistently coddled Saudi
Arabia's backers of religious hate even after their minions blew up
our embassies.</TE>
<TE>   Having squandered the Clinton-led Israel-Palestine peace
initiatives, President Bush watched from the sidelines as the Mideast
caldron, the source of most of the world's terrorist threats, boiled
to overflowing. The enduring terrorist threat has little to do with
the caves of Afghanistan and everything to do with the failure to
secure the Mideast peace promised by Bush's father's Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Arab-Israeli peace should be the highest order in a war
on terrorism. This administration, however--whether to gain poll
approval or because of its allegiance to military contractors--has
raised the military options above any diplomatic efforts. So why not
also throw some nuclear weapons into the mix?</TE>
<TE>   Because it is ludicrous. Does anyone really believe that nuclear
weapons might save the lives of Israelis and Palestinians, when it
assuredly would incinerate them? Or that targeting Russia and China
for potential nuclear attacks would lead those nations to embrace
further moves toward nuclear stability and arms control? Or cause
them to be less threatened by our announced plan to scrap the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and build a missile defense?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Chinese or Russian military planners would be attacked by
their own hard-liners if they failed to respond to this report by
placing even greater emphasis on making their own nuclear forces more
robust, survivable and again on hair-trigger alert in anticipation of
an American first strike. To encourage heightened fears of U.S.
nuclear intentions at a time when the Russians and Chinese are our
allies in the war against terrorism is dizzyingly counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   We need to encourage those countries and other nuclear powers to
think of nuclear weapons as dangerous junk that at best will
boomerang and destroy all that they care about. As the anthrax
example demonstrates, our own investment in weapons of mass
destruction can easily turn into our own undoing.</TE>
<TE>   What madness to even entertain the thought that nuclear weapons
are anything other than the means to the world's destruction. What we
need instead is a U.S.-led worldwide campaign to shun nuclear weapons
as inherently genocidal, to effectively end proliferation of nuclear
weapons technology and material and to treat those nations that dally
in the business of nuclear arms as barbarians in need of restraint.</TE>
<TE>   It is we who have defined rogue nations as those bent on
developing weapons of mass destruction. How then can we so cavalierly
entertain the idea of again leading the world down the path to
nuclear Armageddon?</TE>

<LD>Power corrupts and corrupt officials become skulkers. So do
incompetents. To help citizens flush out governmental bad behavior,
California has a public records act, an open meetings law and other
statutes that are supposed to guarantee access to information at all
levels. Even so, public officials repeatedly stonewall efforts to
find out what's going on in government, in part because there is no
serious penalty for such malfeasance. Meanwhile, the courts have
failed in their role as a check on government abuse by allowing
exemptions to these laws and narrowing their scope.</LD>
<LD>   The recent case of former state Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush sounded an ear-piercing alarm that reform is overdue.
Reporters and even a state senator filed freedom of information
requests to find out how the office was handling certain claims
stemming from the Northridge earthquake. Insurance Department
officials rebuffed them time and again, willy-nilly marking the
relevant documents "confidential." The scandal did not erupt in
public until a year and a half ago, when a department insider leaked
information to the Los Angeles Times. Public outcry forced
Quackenbush to resign.</LD>
<TE>   Such sneakiness is why California needs a constitutional guarantee
of access to governmental information, something that a
constitutional amendment proposed by Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco) would provide. SCA 7, which voters must
approve, is sponsored by the California Newspaper Publishers Assn.
and the California First Amendment Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "The people," it declares, "have a right to attend, observe and be
heard in the meetings of elected and appointed public bodies, and to
inspect and copy records made or received in connection with the
official business of any public body,  agency, officer or employee,
or anyone acting on their behalf." The amendment would not affect
existing open meetings and records laws but would give them backbone
and allow the Legislature to toughen existing law, while preserving
the public's right to privacy. Public bodies would still be able to
hold closed meetings in special circumstances, such as to discuss
personnel matters or legal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Burton's amendment is beginning its long legislative journey
before the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. To become
effective, it will need approval by a two-thirds vote in both houses
of the Legislature. Cities and counties have expressed concern about
SCA 7 and will not support it without amendments, but the Legislature
should not let this strong measure be weakened by politicians and
bureaucrats looking for ways to keep what they do hidden from public
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers: Please speed this amendment along, so that voters can
decide in the Nov. 5 general election whether they want government
people to work in secret or in full public view.</TE>

<LD>Funny what people do when no one's looking. At a closed meeting in
December, four of the five members of the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors--Gloria Molina, Don Knabe, Mike Antonovich and Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke--tried to deep-six a proposed initiative to raise
the salaries of in-home health aides for the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Those aides, unable to convince the supervisors to increase their
pay beyond minimum wage, had filed notice to begin gathering
signatures to put the raise to a vote in November. Before that
process can begin, however, state law requires that county counsel
certify the notice of intention. The four supervisors ordered County
Counsel Lloyd Pellman to skip that step. Only Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky objected.</LD>
<LD>   Government by initiative has plenty of problems, as we've never
hesitated to point out. But arguing against the process, whether from
the bully pulpit or in court, is entirely different from manipulating
it behind the scenes. The plan, it turned out, was not merely
devious. It was illegal, as Pellman eventually advised the
supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisor Molina is trying to pin the blame on Pellman, accusing
him of making phone calls that violated the state's open meetings law
and of giving the supervisors bad advice. Pellman deserves his share
of the blame--the scheme was his idea to begin with--but remind us
again, how many years has Molina been a supervisor?</TE>
<TE>   Neither the health aides nor the taxpayers who pay them (and who
pay the supervisors and the counsel) would have learned about these
shady dealings if not for Times staff writer Evelyn Larrubia.</TE>
<TE>   In using the state's public access laws to request the records of
the meetings, the reporter managed to expose both underhandedness and
incompetence: The county denied Larrubia's request--only to
accidentally enclose the records along with the denial.</TE>
<TE>   The moral? The public's right to know shouldn't depend on
serendipity.</TE>

<LD>Today's Catch-22 award goes to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.), author of a bill that simultaneously eliminates the need
for states to add ethanol to gasoline while forcing California to buy
much more ethanol than presently to add to its gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   A 1990 congressional mandate required that all gasoline contain 2%
of an oxygenate to fight smog. There were two acceptable
oxygenates--ethanol, made primarily from Midwestern corn, and the
petrochemical methyl tertiary butyl ether, better known as MTBE.</LD>
<LD>   California refiners opted to use this latter substance. It mixed
easily with gasoline and was more readily available than ethanol.
Then MTBE began showing up in water wells and other places it didn't
belong, including Lake Tahoe. It turns out that the substance is a
stubborn and potent pollutant and a suspected carcinogen that leaks
from underground storage tanks and moves quickly into water supplies.
In 1999, Gov. Gray Davis ordered a ban on MTBE use beginning at the
end of this year (although he is now considering another year's
delay).</LD>
<TE>   California already uses about 100 million gallons of ethanol each
winter to reduce carbon monoxide in the air and may need more ethanol
to boost the octane of the next generation of reformulated gasolines.
But Midwest farmers want Congress to artificially create a much
bigger California market for them.</TE>
<TE>   When the concern over MTBE first arose, oil refiners and
environmental groups alike agreed that the state's new reformulated
gasolines could meet clean air standards without either MTBE or
ethanol. By repealing the 1990 mandate and banning the use of MTBE
after 2006, Daschle's bill, S 1766, also acknowledges that oxygenates
aren't needed to fight smog. But it nonetheless would require
California to use 500 million gallons of ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   Why, a political naif might ask, would Washington bully California
into using ethanol when it's not necessary? The growers now claim
that ethanol has to be used in massive quantities not as an oxygenate
but as a source of renewable energy to lessen our reliance on oil
imports. That's a slender excuse. This really is a blatant subsidy
for Midwestern corn farmers and the ethanol processors such as the
giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., the big-bucks political
contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle and his Midwestern colleagues have the clout to push the
ethanol mandate through Congress and to win the president's
signature. Their goal is to boost ethanol output over the next decade
from 1.7 billion to 5 billion gallons a year nationally. The
compulsory sale of an unneeded product is bad public policy, and
someone ought to strike it from Daschle's legislation, leaving
science and the market to decide when ethanol is needed and in what
quantities.</TE>
<TE>   But such common sense isn't politically feasible, so Davis and
Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer are negotiating with Daschle
for a three-year delay in implementing the ethanol edict in
California. Without it, experts say the state can suffer gasoline
shortages of 5% to 10% and price spikes, a recipe for another energy
crisis. All for a particularly absurd agribusiness subsidy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Price of Freedom, in Blood," March 7:</LD>
<LD>   The finger of blame for Fadime Sahindal's murder shouldn't be
pointed at Sweden's liberal way of life, which supposedly enabled the
act, but at the Kurds for creating this archaic and ignorant
tradition of "honor killing." None of this would have occurred had
the backward society these people emigrated from not still been mired
in old world superstition. According to the article, the Swedish
government has bent over backward to allow these immigrants the
freedom to prosper in both their own transplanted culture and the
mainstream Swedish society. If it's such a crime for the Kurds to
embrace Swedish culture, then they should simply go back home.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Marfisi</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While there is plenty of truth in your stereotypical portrait of
Scandinavian liberalism, allow me to suggest another angle on why
integration of immigrants in Sweden remains so elusive. There has
been no immigration to make up for labor shortages during the last
decade. Almost all net migration has been the result of family
reunification and asylum. Indeed, this is one of the key deficiencies
in the integration dynamic and one of the reasons that Swedes not
only look away during cultural clashes but at most other times as
well. The so-called tolerance has in reality not entailed anything
remotely resembling acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   There has been precious little contact between communities
segregated not just by choice but by government housing programs.
Thus there are immigrants with citizenship (relatively easy to
obtain) but without work living alongside asylum-seekers without a
work permit.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants are part of American folklore, while in Scandinavia
they are viewed at best as a necessary burden. Only a change in the
mind-set of Swedes and others, aided by more liberal immigration
laws, can pave the way for the kind of integration that might save
the Fadimes of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Bergquist</TE>
<TE>   North Vancouver, Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read, with absolute horror, the Column One article about the
murder of a young Kurdish woman in Sweden by her father--a supposed
"honor killing." Further reading of the newspaper gave me the usual
roll call of death, deceit and destruction throughout the world.
Then, with a shudder, I realized something. When I read about a Kurd
killing his daughter, a crooked president in Zimbabwe or some
executive stealing millions in the U.S., I see one common
denominator. They are all men.</TE>
<TE>   Is there no way we can let women run this troubled world of ours?
Men certainly have done a miserable job. Half of the population of
this country is female, so why isn't that reflected in our
government? Just when are we going to understand that we men, with
our fragile egos, seem to delight in destruction? I am saddened to
think that, in the 21st century, women, who are our mothers, wives
and friends, can be treated so badly.</TE>

<LD>Re "Insanity of March Madness," editorial, March 8: Although I agree
that there were many factors militating against a large turnout in
the March 5 primary, your suggestion that "many Californians didn't
even realize an election was coming up" simply won't wash. Unless one
has no television set, never sees a newspaper or is presently living
in one of those Afghanistan caves, there's no way he or she could be
unaware of the primary.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty percent of the eligible electorate voting is unacceptable,
even if the election were held in January for an hour in the middle
of the night--so put me down as an advocate for compulsory voting.</LD>
<LD>   Joel Rapp</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To the effects of the primary's timing and ballot complexity I
would add that the "greatest generation" is passing from the stage. I
would guess that an analysis by precinct would indicate that voter
turnout is directly linked to age.</TE>
<TE>   In the precinct I supervised, the percentage of registered voters
who turned out was 42%, not the 31% reported for the state. Voters
made the effort to come to the polls using wheelchairs, walkers and
canes. Several indicated that they had voted in every election for
more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   I believe voter turnout can be viewed as a thermometer gauging the
underlying patriotism among the populace. If so, our leaders should
be concerned about our subnormal temperature.</TE>

<TE>   The only way to assure voter participation in elections is to
declare an election void if under 50% of the registered voters don't
vote. I don't believe our government wants people to vote anyway.</TE>

<TE>   The recent election had a low voter turnout yet again. I couldn't
help but wonder if all the latter-day patriots who rushed to display
flags on their cars and houses after Sept. 11 even bothered to vote.
It does take a little more thinking and involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not to worry. My husband and I both voted, and the absence
of yours makes our votes carry more weight. So I suppose I should be
thanking you all. I hope you like the people we voted for!</TE>

<TE>   Re "No-Show Poll Workers Leave Some Unable to Cast Ballots," March
6: I served as a poll worker in the recent election and can now
understand why people shy away from this important civic duty. The
voting process is not difficult to figure out, but the long hours--13
to 14 per day--are the No. 1 reason that might prevent people from
volunteering at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Most young adults lack the time to commit to such a schedule, so
retirees are the majority left to staff the polls. The solution might
be simple: Divide the day in two shifts, and more people would have
the time and willingness to serve.</TE>

<LD>In your March 7 editorial lamenting the voters' renewed support of

Legislature's speakership and committee chairmanships as if there's
something wrong with that. Perhaps at The Times you have no
"institutional memory" of the damage done to the state of California
by the career politicians who held those positions for years and
operated them as personal fiefdoms to the everlasting detriment of
the public.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a record-low turnout in last Tuesday's election,
Californians embraced environmental protection along with a renewed
attempt to protect ourselves from those who long ago forgot what we
sent them to Sacramento to do. We have only to look at our state's
shameful record in public education, among other issues, to see the
"advantages" of the institutional memory that you seem to advocate.</LD>

<LD>Re "Secret Plan Outlines the Unthinkable," by William M. Arkin,
Opinion, March 10: I was a young woman with small children when the
Berlin Wall was being built; atomic bombs were being tested and
people were building bomb shelters. I lived with the anguish of
knowing that in the expected atomic holocaust there was no way I
could protect my children. For years I felt the fear and worked for
peace. At last it seemed that disarmament was a possibility. Now my
children are grown and I have grandchildren. But because of this
administration's saber-rattling--the legitimizing of atomic arms as a
reasonable response in military conflict--the specter of atomic
destruction rises once more and the fear returns.</LD>
<LD>   To even consider building a program and a plan for the use of
atomic weapons is outrageous madness. Let us divest ourselves of this
set of Dr. Strangelove clones and find some leaders who will help us
bring about peaceful resolutions of our world conflicts rather than
lead us into another arms race.</LD>

<TE>   As a cancer survivor, it's horrifying to me that the Bush
administration has secretly concocted plans to develop tactical
nuclear weapons ("U.S. Works Up Plan for Using Nuclear Arms," March
9).</TE>
<TE>   The nightmare devastation wrought on the civilian populations of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki should be burned indelibly on our collective
consciousness. Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons, small
or large. No soldier of any army deserves such inhumane annihilation.
Winds could carry radioactive fallout away from military targets for
a radius of many miles, raining slow, cancerous death on innocent
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   That we would stoop to consider such a ruthlessly immoral act is a
supreme irony in view of President Bush's recent remarks. Axis of
evil, indeed.</TE>

<TE>   The Times and every news publication that subsequently ran
articles regarding the U.S.'s new plans for using nuclear arms have
endangered the security of our country. Regardless of whether the
Bush administration is correct in making such a plan, the information
should not have been made public. By making it public, we may be one
step closer to entering a new Cold War. At a time when it is of
utmost importance that we build an alliance of countries, the last
thing we need is to give other countries reasons to distrust us. The
media need to learn that in the current environment sometimes
national security is more important than being the first to break a
story.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for publishing the front-page article about the
just-disclosed first nuclear strike strategy "against at least seven
nations." It is absolutely mind-boggling that people do not
comprehend the scale of destruction and suffering that nuclear bombs
have already caused and would cause if used again. To people in
Southern California--a region with over 13 million people living near
many military targets--this should be scarier than all the hoopla
about anthrax. To me, as a scientist used to dealing with numbers,
this is also scarier than the gruesome attacks of Sept. 11. The
retaliation elicited by a "first use" could be the destruction of the
U.S. as a functioning society. This is what I would call an
impeachable offense, even worse than Enron!</TE>

<TE>   Can The Times really be surprised that the U.S. government makes
contingency plans for the use of our weaponry? Would you rather have
us without such contingency plans? After quoting nuclear arms
opponents first, you supply a rebuttal from the Heritage Foundation,
labeling it "conservative." If it deserves a label, don't the two
nuclear arms opponent organizations also deserve some sort of label,
like "liberal" or "left-leaning"?</TE>
<TE>   You make the reader wade through the bulk of the article before
noting that Congress requested that the nuclear strategic review be
updated and that the Clinton administration also had nuclear
contingency plans. Is anyone other than The Times surprised that
plans developed after Sept. 11 may have changed from those done eight
years ago? (The Times does not know, of course, if in fact the plans
are any different.)</TE>

<LD>Marion Doenhoff, 92, who helped shape German postwar journalism as
publisher of a leading weekly newspaper and author of best-selling
books on her native East Prussia, died Sunday in Berlin of unstated
causes.</LD>
<LD>   Born to an aristocratic family in East Prussia, Doenhoff studied
in Switzerland after the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. But she
returned to look after family holdings near Koenigsberg, now
Kalingrad, Russia, during the war.</LD>
<LD>   As the Soviet army approached toward the war's end, she fled west
to Germany on horseback. The seven-week journey provided the material
for her 1962 best-selling book on East Prussia's people and their
history. She later wrote a book warning of the dangers of
globalization.</LD>
<TE>   Doenhoff joined the liberal Hamburg-based newspaper Die Zeit in
1946, rose to chief editor in 1968, and became co-publisher from 1972
until her death. Doenhoff also helped found the German Council on
Foreign Relations in 1955.</TE>

<LD>Tony Gonzales, 72, former wrestler known as "the Mysterious Medic,"
died March 4 of heart failure at his home in Alabama Port near

<LD>   Gonzales, who was making his living pumping gas, began his
wrestling career in Texas in 1954, when he was hired by Jack Donovan
and Buddy Colt.</LD>
<LD>   He made his ring debut as a good-guy wrestler called "Yaqui Joe."</LD>
<TE>   But in 1961 he moved to Mobile and became the bad guy billed as
"the Mysterious Medic" in white tights and a white doctor's coat. He
was one of the first to wear a mask in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-10, 245-pound wrestler inspired so much hatred that in
1962 a preacher turned wrestling fanatic jumped in the ring and
stabbed him 17 times.</TE>

<HD>C. Wright, 83; Father of Black Museums</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles H. Wright, a Detroit obstetrician and gynecologist who gave
birth to Detroit's first African American history museum in the
mid-1960s, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Wright, considered the father of the national movement to
establish African American museums, died of a heart attack March 7 in
the Detroit suburb of Southfield.</LD>
<LD>   Wright created the International Afro-American Museum in a Detroit
row house where he lived and worked in 1965, donating $1,000 a month
to pay for a small staff and costs.</LD>
<TE>   Inspired by a memorial for Danish World War II heroes in
Copenhagen, Wright believed that African Americans needed to connect
with their history and celebrate black heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd bring healthy babies into the world and I'd see them later
and they'd be psychologically scarred," Wright told the Detroit Free
Press in 1997. "I saw we had to do something about society--and the
museum was an effort to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Wright's daughter Stephanie Wright Griggs said her father founded
the museum "to inspire people to have a greater sense of self-pride."</TE>
<TE>   "He was always concerned about African Americans having
self-esteem," she said. "He wanted to counter some of the negative
stereotypes we have about ourselves, and he felt very strongly that
there was a lot to be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Wright could not have envisioned that his small museum, which
originally housed its exhibits in a trailer that traveled to schools
and state fairs, would one day become the world's largest African
American history museum.</TE>
<TE>   Forming a partnership with the city of Detroit, the renamed Museum
of African American History opened in a new 28,000-square-foot
building in the city's University Cultural Center in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   With voter-approved construction bonds, a third,
120,000-square-foot museum opened in 1997; a year later it was
formally rededicated and renamed the Charles H. Wright Museum of
African American History.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is anchored by a permanent exhibit that educates
visitors on African civilization, the "Middle Passage" taken by slave
ships bound for America, the Underground Railroad and the
civil-rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   The museum and its annual African World Festival in August draw
more than 1 million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Wright was a dreamer, but he had the fortitude and the
passion and was blessed with the ability to get others to believe his
dream, and that's his legacy," said Harry Harrison, a museum vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a clergyman, Wright was born in Dothan, Ala. He earned
a bachelor's degree from Alabama State College (now University) in
1939 and graduated from Meharry Medical College in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, who interned at Harlem Hospital, began a private practice
in obstetrics and gynecology in Detroit in 1953. Before retiring in
1986, he delivered more than 7,000 babies.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't delivering babies, Wright was active in the
civil-rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   He provided medical services to marchers in Selma, Ala., and
Bogalusa, La., in the '60s. And Wright, who never lost his light,
melodious Alabama drawl, encouraged other physicians to support and
donate money for social causes, including the African Medical
Education fund, which helped Africans studying in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Detroit, he led protests on various issues, including
eliminating segregation policies at a Detroit women's hospital that
prevented black obstetricians from delivering the babies of patients
they admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically said, 'If I admit [a patient], I will deliver my
babies,'" said his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "He would fight discrimination, if it existed, with anybody," said
Robert Shannon, former museum board president. "He's a great reason
the hospitals in Detroit are as equal as they are."</TE>
<TE>   When her father first started the African American history museum,
Griggs said, he did everything from fund-raising to recording oral
histories.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that African American history wasn't always accurately
recorded, Wright believed that the only way to get it down correctly
"was to document and record your own history," said his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go around with him in those days, and he'd interview people
and say, 'These people need to be recorded for history,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wright wrote several plays, including "Were You There?," a
morality play about making the right choices in life. He wrote
several books, including "Paul Robeson: Labor's Forgotten Champion."</TE>
<TE>   Under Wright's leadership, the museum and Detroit's public high
school principals established the Paul Robeson Scholarship. Wright
was one of the founders of the Assn. of African American Museums.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole life has been a continuous quest for freedom," he once
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Griggs, Wright is survived by his wife, Roberta;
his daughter Dr. Carla Wright; two stepchildren, Wilbur Hughes III
and Barbara Smith; and one granddaughter.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Sale Called Threat to Reforms</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker urges firm to
separate auditing and consulting duties. Two more clients turn to
other auditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts by the troubled Andersen accounting firm to sell itself to a
larger rival are a desperate act that threatens reform of the
nation's financial reporting system, former Fed Chairman Paul A.
Volcker, who heads a panel reviewing Andersen's operations, said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen has talked to both Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Ernst &amp;
Young International about a business combination in recent days,
according to people familiar with the talks.</LD>
<LD>   But Volcker said such an acquisition would reduce competition and
blunt momentum for major reform in the accounting industry.</LD>
<TE>   "The other accounting firms have said quite openly they don't like
the reforms we are suggesting, and it seems they would like Andersen
to go away," Volcker said. "The worst result for the nation would be
the disappearance of Andersen and no reforms."</TE>
<TE>   Volcker noted, however, that Andersen was "desperate" to survive
in the face of a possible criminal indictment and loss of clients.
The already wounded company has been bleeding clients and on Monday
lost two more: FedEx Corp. and Riggs National Corp., a banking
company.</TE>
<TE>   As former Federal Reserve Board chairman, Volcker's views carry
weight on Capitol Hill, experts said. But one said Volcker's view
that competition is needed would have little sway with the Justice
Department, which is considering an indictment of Andersen for its
shredding of Enron Corp. documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Volcker has great influence on Congress but not at Justice, where
the decision will be made," said John Coffee Jr., a law professor at
Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the only way Andersen can protect itself from indictment
would be an agreement to cooperate with the government's
investigation of top Enron executives, such as former Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker, who guided the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, is
heading a special independent panel empowered by Andersen to make
changes in its management structure and business practices in the
wake of the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker on Monday released his blueprint to reform Andersen's
business practices, a model he says can extend to other accounting
firms. He released the plan earlier than expected, fearing that delay
would hurt Andersen's chances of survival.</TE>
<TE>   His plan would split Andersen into separate accounting and
consulting companies to avoid conflicts in which auditors overlook
irregularities so as not to lose the lucrative consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting company would focus on the auditing and tax
preparation disciplines that are the traditional functions of the
industry. It also would rotate the lead partners on each audit every
five years and provide for more oversight of the technical and
analytic decisions that go into auditing a company's books.</TE>
<TE>   Although Volcker's panel was empowered to make changes, the fate
of the proposal was clouded by the prospect of Andersen being
acquired by a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen from Andersen, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte said that
their respective firms would not comment on the specific merger
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen issued a statement that said, "Andersen is considering
many options to enable us to continue to successfully serve our
clients and promote the career opportunities of our people."</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte spokesman Matthew Batters confirmed that Deloitte was
examining how it could "address the current and future issues facing
the profession," but he declined to provide any details.</TE>
<TE>   But people familiar with the Deloitte talks said the two
accounting firms had discussed options, including a merger, the sale
of the entire Andersen firm and the purchase of parts of the
accounting company's business.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement could come as early as this week if the firms can
solve Andersen's huge liability resulting from its work for Enron,
the Houston-based energy trader that filed for bankruptcy protection
Dec. 2. Andersen's Enron liability also is an issue in the Ernst &amp;
Young talks.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has offered to settle the claims of shareholders,
employees and other groups with grievances against Enron for
$750million to be paid out over five years.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be surprised if they can handle the legal complexity of
such a transaction," Volcker said. "Who knows what legal contortions
they would have to go through to get this done?"</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of such a transaction extend beyond Volcker to the
plaintiff of a class-action lawsuit against Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not tolerate any situation where Andersen partners
protect their assets and go with their lives unscathed while there
are thousands of investors who suffered billions and billions of
dollars in losses," said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the University
of California Board of Regents.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system is the lead plaintiff in a massive class-action
lawsuit against Andersen and Enron's senior management over the loss
of investment money from Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the university system might take legal action to block
any transaction that might diminish the amount of funds the
plaintiffs hope to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of a criminal indictment has increased pressure on
Andersen to find a way to survive. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has barred individual accountants convicted of a crime
such as obstruction of justice from certifying audited financial
statements, said spokeswoman Christi Harlan. However, the statute is
unclear on whether an entire firm could be subjected to same penalty,
potentially a death sentence for Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker and former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner say the
absorption of Andersen by another firm, or its demise through a
bankruptcy, would concentrate too much power in the remaining four
firms.</TE>
<TE>   Under normal circumstances, a merger between Andersen and one of
the other large accounting firms probably would face antitrust
scrutiny, Turner said. But with the Andersen firm rapidly melting
away, regulators may allow such a deal to preserve jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has annual international revenue of $9.3 billion,
compared with $12.4 billion for Deloitte and $9.9 billion for Ernst &amp;
Young.</TE>
<TE>   Similar fears that the accounting industry was contracting too
rapidly into a few powerful firms helped derail a proposed
$18-billion combination of Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   That deal would have created the world's largest accounting firm
but faced criticism over how it would affect competition here and
abroad. European regulators were among the biggest opponents, Turner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The two firms called off the deal, citing regulatory hurdles and
the potential difficulty of merging the cultures of the two firms.
But a 1998 merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand created
the world's largest accounting firm.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Drawing Static</HD>
<DH>Radio: No. 1 broadcaster disputes critics who say it
conceals stations to evade FCC ownership caps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many radio stations does Clear Channel Communications Inc. really
own?</LD>
<LD>   Some advertisers and competing broadcasters have petitioned the
Federal Communications Commission, alleging that the media giant has
evaded federal law and misled regulators by taking control of radio
stations above the ownership limit in various markets by warehousing
them in front companies.</LD>
<LD>   "The problem is that you have a company that's been told not to
own radio stations in certain markets and has decided it's going to
control those radio stations anyway," said Arthur Belendiuk, a
Washington communications attorney who filed the petitions opposing
Clear Channel's proposed purchases of two stations.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel, the nation's biggest broadcaster, claims ownership
of "approximately" 1,225 stations and said it fully complies with
federal law, which forbids owning more than eight stations in a
particular market.</TE>
<TE>   "The FCC has reviewed every one of our transactions and we've
abided by the rules," said Clear Channel spokeswoman Pam Taylor. "We
just happen to be really good at maximizing flexibility under the
rules that are in place."</TE>
<TE>   However, FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell in a letter last month
said the agency was "considering carefully" the issues raised by
opponents of Clear Channel's planned acquisition of an Ohio station.
Powell added that the FCC had initiated proceedings to examine the
effects of the consolidation that has swept the radio industry in the
last six years.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio-based chain said it has entered various deals to
control sales or programming at about 75 stations beyond the ones it
already owns. Under local marketing agreements, Clear Channel can
take over another station's programming, and with joint sales
agreements, it sells the station's advertising time. In most cases
under these arrangement, Clear Channel pays a fee to the station's
owner and seeks to sell enough advertising to cover its costs and
still earn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Small radio chains that struck such deals with Clear Channel say
they operate independently of the conglomerate. The chains say they
have merely turned the FCC limits into a business opportunity by
buying stations the conglomerate could not, then auctioning back the
advertising operations as allowed by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Clear Channel's involvement with such marketing and joint
sales deals flows through San Antonio lawyer Van H. Archer III, who
has stakes in companies that own 15 radio stations, several in
markets where Clear Channel is legally barred from owning any more.
All 15 of the stations have sold back their advertising rights to
Clear Channel, Archer said.</TE>
<TE>   Archer also has ties to Clear Channel. He incorporated Clear
Channel's charitable arm, the Clear Channel Communications
Foundation, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Clear Channel put up $2 million in the mid-1990s to
guarantee a NationsBank loan provided to a firm called Mercury
Broadcasting Inc., according to regulatory filings. Texas state
records show Archer is 100% owner of Mercury Broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Archer said his arrangements with Clear Channel
had "no impropriety." He said the financing for his companies comes
from other sources and added that any Clear Channel loan guarantee
"definitely does not ring a bell." He said an accounting executive at
Clear Channel had asked him to incorporate the conglomerate's
nonprofit foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Archer said his stations entered the advertising agreements with
Clear Channel because it is "a company that's been around for a long
time, and they're going to be around for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   "They're reputable people," he said, "and I don't have to worry
about them not paying the [advertising] fees."</TE>
<TE>   Harry Martin, an attorney for Archer's firms, said: "My clients
have put their own money in. These are far from being front
companies."</TE>
<TE>   The  industry long has been rife with rumors that broadcasters
have concealed stations to sidestep federal ownership caps, which
until the mid-1990s forbade a company to own more than four stations
in a market and 40 nationally. But the new allegations are focused on
radio's biggest player at a time when media companies are bracing for
a new round of consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel, once a modest broadcasting chain, expanded
dramatically after the 1996 deregulation of the radio industry. The
company vaulted to the top of the  business in a series of massive
acquisitions, and today it owns about 10% of the nation's radio
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators approved some of the acquisitions on the condition that
Clear Channel sell certain stations to prevent it from accumulating
unfair power over programming or advertising rates in some cities. As
part of Clear Channel's $24-billion merger with AMFM Inc., for
example, the company agreed to divest 110 stations.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Clear Channel appears to control the obscure
companies buying some of the divested stations. In other cases, Clear
Channel is overstepping the bounds of the traditional joint sales
agreement, which would allow it to sell air time for another station,
by taking full control of the station's management, according to the
petitions filed with the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the AMFM deal in 2000, Clear Channel agreed to divest
KBRQ-FM in Waco, Texas. The station, along with at least five others,
was sold to Chase Radio, a small Texas-based firm of which Archer is
49% owner. In November, Chase Radio asked the FCC to approve a plan
to sell the station back to Clear Channel.</TE>
<TE>   A petition filed by Belendiuk in January alleges that Clear
Channel already runs Chase Radio's stations. According to the
document, Clear Channel filed an employment report disclosing that it
had employees working at KBRQ. Moreover, Clear Channel's Web site
said the executive overseeing  its Waco stations also managed KBRQ.
Clear Channel also filed engineering documents on behalf of the
station, the petition states.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, an attorney for Chase Radio, said the company withdrew its
request to sell the station before Belendiuk filed his petition. He
said Chase had concluded that federal regulators would probably
reject the deal on the grounds that Clear Channel would have too much
of the Waco advertising market. Martin also disputed the allegations
in Belendiuk's petition.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Chase Radio previously entered a local marketing
agreement and handed control of some operations over to Clear Channel
but didn't have to disclose it initially because the station's signal
was redirected so it wouldn't overlap with Clear Channel's stations
nearby. He said the engineering report was filed as a Clear Channel
document by mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC has yet to rule on another sale opposed by Belendiuk. In
November, he petitioned the FCC to deny a request by Clear Channel to
buy WKKJ-FM in Chillicothe, Ohio. The station once belonged to Jacor
Communications, which agreed to sell WKKJ and other stations to
secure approval for its acquisition of a rival.</TE>
<TE>   So Jacor sold WKKJ to Secret Communications II, a small firm owned
by Frank E. Wood, Jacor's former president. In August 1999, Secret
entered into a time-brokerage agreement handing control of
programming and advertising to Concord Media Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But Belendiuk's petition alleges that Concord is a front company
run by Clear Channel. Concord's president is Mark Jorgenson, a radio
broker who has negotiated station sales for Clear Channel. As in the
case of the Waco station, the petition cites Clear Channel regulatory
filings as evidence that it controls Concord stations.</TE>
<TE>   Concord Media said it entered a joint sales agreement with Clear
Channel in June 1999, and that agreement was not disclosed in other
FCC filings, Concord said, because such information was not required.
Concord said Belendiuk unfairly criticizes the company for doing
business in markets where Clear Channel has a heavy concentration of
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "It would very difficult to purchase a station where Clear Channel
does not have a presence," Concord Media said in legal filing.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a
consumer advocacy law firm, said the questions surrounding Clear
Channel's relationships with small companies such as Chase underscore
deregulation's flaws.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 telecommunications overhaul "was supposed to end these
evasions by making the broadcaster limits high enough to satisfy all
but the greediest," Schwartzman said. "The greediest have kept at
it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Pursue Lawsuit to Curb Cigarette Marketing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department is demanding sweeping changes in tobacco
marketing and manufacturing practices as part of a federal lawsuit
that many observers had expected to be dumped by the Bush
administration.</LD>
<LD>   In a document turned over to industry lawyers, Justice Department
attorneys said they would seek a court order forcing tobacco
companies to reduce levels of nicotine, the habit-forming substance
in their cigarette brands, "to the greatest extent possible."</LD>
<LD>   They called for a slew of other anti-smoking measures, including
elimination of cigarette advertising in stores, use of graphic
warning labels filling at least 50% of the space on cigarette packs
and print ads, and a ban on lobbying against ordinances directed at
secondhand smoke.</LD>
<TE>   The multibillion-dollar suit is a holdover from the Clinton years,
and many thought the Bush administration--buoyed by millions of
dollars in tobacco contributions to the Republican Party--would
abandon or settle it on terms favorable to the industry. Such
expectations mounted last year when Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
initially sought only $1.8million to fund the litigation team.</TE>
<TE>   Yet certain of the curbs surpass even the optimistic wish lists of
public health advocates. The measures are spelled out in a 47-page
document given to the industry in December to indicate what the
government hoped to gain from the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies agreed in 1998 to marketing restrictions as part
of their $246-billion settlements with the states. But the Justice
Department proposals are tougher than those included in the state
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be surprising at all for the Reno Justice Department
to ask for this," said an industry spokesman who would not speak for
attribution, referring to former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. But for the
demands to surface under Ashcroft "is remarkable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It suggests either that Justice Department attorneys involved in
the case are "completely off on their own" or that Ashcroft "has
taken up the banner and decided this industry really does need to be
dealt with severely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defendants include Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Moskowitz, a spokesman for Reynolds, said the company was
continuing to prepare its defense of the case, which has a trial date
of June 2003. "We don't believe there is a need for additional
advertising and marketing restrictions that go beyond those detailed
in" the states' settlements, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions from industry foes ranged from cautious optimism to
enthusiastic praise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an amazing change of heart by the administration, which
has been lukewarm to cold about this litigation," said Sen. Richard
Durbin (D-Ill.), a leading tobacco critic in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry that maybe this reflects the career people at Justice and
not the full commitment of the Justice Department leadership," said
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), "but I'm waiting to be
pleasantly surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden said Monday that the
department has made a commitment "to this litigation, and this
document reinforces that."</TE>
<TE>   Filed in September 1999, during President Clinton's second term,
the suit originally sought recovery of billions of dollars a year in
smoking-related health-care costs paid by U.S. taxpayers. U.S.
District Judge Gladys Kessler dismissed the cost recovery portion of
the suit but has allowed the government to pursue claims that tobacco
companies were guilty of fraud and racketeering in concealing the
hazards and addictiveness of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Justice Department document, court- appointed
officials would monitor the industry's compliance. Among the demands:</TE>
<TE>   * An end to the estimated $3.54billion the industry spends each
year on point-of-purchase advertising and promotions, including
in-store signage and display racks.</TE>
<TE>   * Restriction of cigarette ads to black-and-white print format.
Alluring imagery, such as people driving fast cars or cavorting at
the beach, would be barred. And warning labels would have to cover at
least 50% of advertising and package space.</TE>
<TE>   * Creation of a foundation to develop, test and promote less
hazardous cigarettes, funded by cigarette makers.</TE>
<TE>   * Stiff penalties to tobacco companies if underage smoking fails
to decline by target amounts. The targets include a 60% reduction in
10 years, with the companies liable for at least $80million for each
percentage point short of the goal.</TE>
<TE>   As part of their settlements with the states, tobacco firms agreed
to eliminate billboards and transit and stadium signs. They also
pledged not to use cartoon characters in promotions and to bar
distribution of caps and shirts with tobacco logos.</TE>

<HD>SEC Investigating WorldCom, Qwest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping up its investigation of the telecommunications industry's
accounting practices, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
demanded internal documents from WorldCom Inc. and Qwest
Communications International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies Monday acknowledged receiving requests for
information. The SEC is examining the books of telephone-and-data
service providers after the bankruptcies of Enron Corp. and Global
Crossing Ltd. Investors have questioned whether the carriers
improperly boosted sales by swapping network space.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's enforcement division is seeking documents on WorldCom's
accounting for so-called goodwill and a charge taken in 2000 as well
as information on company loans to top officials. The firm was also
asked for disputed customer bills and sales commissions,
organizational charts and personnel records of former workers, and
information on its tracking and review of analysts' profit estimates.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom, the second-biggest U.S. long-distance phone company,
said its practices complied with accounting standards and laws.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC requested information on a charge WorldCom took in the
third quarter of 2000. The company said in October 2000 that the
$405-million charge was related to domestic and international
wholesale bills it couldn't collect because of customer bankruptcies,
litigation and contractual disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's informal request also covers WorldCom's handling of a
change in rules for goodwill accounting. WorldCom said last month it
might have a write-down of $15 billion to $20 billion for the change
in accounting rules for goodwill, which is the difference between the
price paid for an asset and its book value.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom have been punished by
investor fears that the company's slowing revenue growth, competition
with other Baby Bells and a glut in capacity would lead it to the
same fate as competing telecom companies, such as Global Crossing,
that have filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares, off 18 cents to $9.01 in regular Nasdaq trading,
dropped to $8.39 in after-hours activity on news of the SEC request.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Qwest acknowledged an inquiry into the former Baby
Bell's accounting practices in 2000 and 2001. Denver-based Qwest said
it planned to respond fully to the request.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry also focuses on equipment sales Qwest made to
customers such as KMC Telecom Holdings Inc., which sold Internet
services back to Qwest, and changes in the production schedules and
lives of some phone directories.</TE>
<TE>   "They've asked us for some documents," Chief Executive Joe Nacchio
said. "They haven't told us why, other than they want to explore
these areas. We'll just let that play out."</TE>
<TE>   Qwest said sales of optical capacity in which there were
reciprocal agreements with customers made up 2.8% of revenue in 2000
and 5.1% of revenue in 2001. Revenue from sales of Internet equipment
to customers who then bought Internet services from Qwest was less
than 1% in both years, as was revenue from changes in its phone
directories.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed last month on behalf of shareholders alleges those
deals were used to artificially pump up Qwest's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications International shares fell 25 cents to close
at $9.46 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Anschutz Seeks to Take Theater Company Public</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: $345-million Regal IPO may indicate
turnaround for movie exhibitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking another step in consolidating his position as the nation's No.
1 movie theater owner, Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz filed
Monday for a $345-million initial public stock offering by his Regal
Entertainment Group.</LD>
<LD>   The widely anticipated move also signals a possible turnaround in
the financially troubled film exhibition business, which has seen
eight major chains file for bankruptcy  during recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz created Regal by combining three theater chains he
acquired through bankruptcy reorganizations: Regal Cinemas Corp.,
United Artists Theatre Co. and Edwards Theatres Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Reemerging with a leaner and potentially stronger company, yet
boasting the largest number of screens in the country, Anschutz is
positioning himself to take advantage of the remaining opportunities
for further consolidation, said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with
Janco Partners Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Theaters may not be a high-growth business," Harrigan said, "but
it is a strong and steady business."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, total box-office revenue increased for the 10th
consecutive year, rising 10% to $8.4 billion. Attendance grew roughly
5% to 1.5 billion moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   "Anschutz did a good job of bottom fishing," said Harrigan, who
added that many theater chains expanded "like drunken sailors ...
building too many theaters too fast" during the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Not only were there too many theaters, they were too big, with
many sporting a dozen or more screens at a time when Hollywood was
churning out fewer blockbuster hits.</TE>
<TE>   The reclusive Anschutz did not return calls, and Regal declined to
comment on its filing.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz built his fortune bartering railroad right of ways,
creating a 16,000-mile fiber optic network that is now Qwest
Communications. Recently, Anschutz has been building a sports and
entertainment empire with stakes in sports arenas including Los
Angeles' Staples Center as well as teams such as the Los Angeles
Kings hockey team and the Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire soccer
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Los Angeles gave Anschutz approval to develop a
$1-billion entertainment district on 27 acres downtown. It would
include a movie theater complex.</TE>
<TE>   Under bankruptcy protection, Anschutz closed many of the Regal
group's under-performing theaters and extracted the firm from
high-cost leases. He found further savings by combining  managements
of the three chains, centralizing  management in Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of the seasonal peak for moviegoing, Regal's
stock offering is scheduled to hit the market in June, when the next
installment of the "Star Wars" series will be playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Regal is moving forward with good theaters," said Jeff Blake,
head of distribution and marketing for Sony Pictures. "They got rid
of their bad theater leases, aggressively consolidated their
operations and what they presented to us [at  ShoWest in Las Vegas
last week] is pretty exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Regal said it operates 17% of all the theater screens in the
United States, with 5,885 screens in 561 theaters in 36 states.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, AMC Entertainment Inc., the second-largest theater
chain, plans to go to market Wednesday with an offering for 9million
common shares. AMC shares, which closed Monday at $11.29, have more
than doubled during the last 52 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   According to financial information filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the combined financial performance of the three
chains constituting the new Regal Entertainment last year had revenue
of $2billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $358million.</TE>
<TE>   Regal plans to use $180million of the IPO proceeds to repay
Edward's Cinema debt and an additional $76million to redeem that
company's preferred stock. Most of the remaining funds would be
devoted to general corporate expenditures, including acquisitions and
working capital.</TE>
<TE>   Regal plans to sell Class A shares, which have one vote each on
company issues. Anschutz owns 45.6 million Regal Class B shares, and
an affiliate of investment firm Oaktree Capital Management owns 12.3
million Class B shares. Each Class B share has 10 votes each.</TE>
<TE>   Regal will seek to have its shares trade on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol RGC. Underwriters for the stock sale will
include Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Bros.</TE>

<HD>Layoffs Hit Home in Rochester</HD>
<DH>The once-resilient region struggles after Global Crossing
job cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROCHESTER, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Janet Mahoney has never had to apply for a job since getting out of
college 20 years ago. With high-tech positions popping up all over
town, companies were wooing her.</LD>
<LD>   But as one of the growing number of employees let go by
fiber-optic networking company Global Crossing Ltd., which filed for
bankruptcy protection in January, the 41-year-old technology
executive is finding the job market much different.</LD>
<LD>   Now, she's using an executive recruitment firm to help her polish
her resume, give her interviewing tips and devise a strategy to land
a job. Her only requirement: She wants to stay in the family-friendly
Rochester area.</LD>
<TE>   That won't be easy because Rochester also is struggling. The
six-county area of 1.1 million in upstate New York is trying to
maintain its status as a pocket of affluence and resiliency while it
attempts to redefine itself and lessen its dependence on the region's
dominant employer, Eastman Kodak Co. It is an economy in transition
as Kodak, which once accounted for 22% of the region's payroll, has
dismissed nearly two-thirds of its local work force in the last 20
years--a total of 36,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak is cutting more this year, and Global Crossing's Rochester
operation--the company's biggest with more than 1,300 employees a
year ago--probably will take another hit after the company's news
Friday that it will cut 1,600 more workers in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders long have boasted about Rochester's elastic
economy, which has been able to withstand several decades of
battering to a hard-hit manufacturing sector stretching from Buffalo
to the Adirondack Mountains. An ever-emerging stream of small, new
companies consistently has picked up the slack from major layoffs at
Kodak and the other giant employers, Xerox Corp. and Bausch &amp; Lomb
Inc., and increased the job ranks every year.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, as a wet March snow blew in off Lake Ontario, the
region felt another kind of chill: The state Labor Department's
monthly survey found that the historically low unemployment rate
jumped to 6.3% in January, higher than the nation's 5.5%, and that
the area had lost 12,400 jobs in the previous 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   For Rochester's popular, dynamic mayor, William A. Johnson Jr.,
the news wasn't surprising. Long warning that the elastic in the
economy was getting stretched out, Johnson proclaimed that the area
had reached the saturation point in its ability to absorb the
thousands of jobs eliminated at the Big Three and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Objectively, we only look good compared to Buffalo," Johnson said
in his annual state of the city speech last week. "From a national
perspective, greater Rochester's rates of job and population growth
have ranked near the bottom of all metro areas for the past 30
years."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Rochester's employment numbers ranked it 249th out of
288 metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   For Mahoney, a single mother of a 6-year-old boy, the dire
employment news means her effort to find a job in Rochester just got
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it here, and I don't want to move," says the former Global
Crossing director of call-center technology.</TE>
<TE>   Despite harsh winters, the area is known as a friendly,
family-oriented community where neighbors don't have fences
separating their properties. With a median household income of
$31,000--and high-tech pay far surpassing that--the city and
surrounding Monroe County can be quite affordable. The median home
price is $94,000. The region usually is the top United Way
contributor per capita nationwide and has a long history of giving,
fostered by the philanthropy of George Eastman and his photo
equipment company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Woes Hit Hard</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney, among about 300 Global Crossing employees laid off in the
last year, had bought into the company's vision of a seamless,
worldwide, high-speed voice and data network that the onetime Beverly
Hills company was building. That is why Global's bankruptcy has hit
Rochester's psyche harder than the thousands of layoffs at Kodak,
Xerox and Bausch &amp; Lomb.</TE>
<TE>   This, after all, wasn't an old-line company shedding weight in the
face of stiff competition. This was the promise of the future, the
leading edge of a wave of telecom firms that were going to put
Rochester on the map as a top communications technology center in the
nation. This was the heir to Rochester Telephone Co., the longtime
utility that was the safest of investments, a stock for widows and
orphans.</TE>
<TE>   Rochester Telephone's parent firm, Frontier Corp., was purchased
by Global Crossing in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not Kodak slugging it out with Fuji," said Rocco
DiGiovanni, Monroe County's director of planning and development.
"People felt betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   Although the number of telecom firms in the area has grown 30% in
two years, to 92, much of that growth came during a telecom boom that
has since gone bust.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot is PaeTec Corp., a local phone service and
networking provider in suburban Fairport, which will hire 15 to 20
former Global Crossing workers. PaeTec's chairman, Arunas A.
Chesonis, believes that despite the bad year Rochester has had, tech
jobs will help to pull the area out of its doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   Chesonis and analysts like Kent Gardner at the Center for
Governmental Research, a local economic research firm, believe there
is still a lot of power in the small business engines, not only at
tech companies but also as biotech and the 17 colleges and
universities that dot the area. Employment had grown every year in
the past decade until last year, and they are sure the young firms
will spur growth again.</TE>
<TE>   "The real success," Gardner says, "is that Rochester has nearly
weaned itself from its [economic] dependence on Kodak."</TE>
<TE>   From its peak of 60,000 Rochester employees in 1982, Kodak now has
24,000 in the area and will likely drop below 20,000 this year, based
on previously announced worldwide cuts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But changes aren't coming fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney, who lost a $32,000 severance package when Global filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 28, is entertaining job
prospects in the Scranton, Pa., area and northern New Jersey. Many
others who call themselves ex-GXers after the ticker symbol of the
company's once highflying stock, also are looking elsewhere--or
looking to get out of the industry altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "The job market here is completely dead, especially for networking
and high-tech jobs," says Malcolm Kirby, a former director of
information technology and product development. He's now looking at a
job possibility out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Rolin (Bud) Peets, who thought heading up computer security
operations at Global would be part of a growing field, says there are
no similar jobs for him in Rochester. Born and raised here, he and
his wife don't want to take their two children from their
grandparents and the rest of their extended families. So he joined
one of his brothers in the masonry business, laying bricks and stone.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one job, with 20 employees who would be reporting to
me, but it paid only in the mid-$40,000 range," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even for an area with a high median income, tech jobs usually pay
much more. Kodak employees average $61,000 a year, PaeTec workers
$82,000. Peets said he was earning a base annual salary of $115,000
plus bonuses totaling $35,000 at Global before he was laid off at the
end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Johnson worries that lower-paying service jobs are replacing
higher-paying manufacturing jobs, but he knows the economic problems
are multifaceted. Companies are leaving town because of burdensome
state and local taxes, he said, and they're taking Rochester's future
with them. In the last decade, 41% of Rochester citizens 20 to 34
years old have left town. That has played a major part in limiting
overall population growth to only 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of my daughters left Rochester, though one has
returned," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney is doing her best to stay in town. After going into a
panic for about two hours after first learning about Global's
bankruptcy, she started a systematic approach to recovering her lost
severance pay and getting a new job.</TE>
<TE>   She also started to conserve money, pulling her son, Brian, out of
a $700-a-month day-care arrangement, shopping for values, even
clipping coupons, which she had never done before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offering a Helping Hand</TE>
<TE>   After forming an Internet discussion group for former Global
employees, Mahoney joined 16 other ex-GXers from around the country
to create a steering committee to represent the interests of fired
workers. They meet often, discussing strategies for recovering money
they're owed, job possibilities, and rumors about their former
employer.</TE>
<TE>   They also have sought help from local members of
Congress--Democratic U.S. Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter held a
meeting in Rochester on Saturday to hear their concerns--and brought
in lawyers to press their claims in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a learning experience," Mahoney said. "I'll be a
different person from all of this. But my first priority is to get a
job, and my goal is to be employed in April."</TE>
<TE>   Many afternoons, while her son is at school, Mahoney heads for the
executive employment firm Goodrich &amp; Sherwood, which Global hired to
provide outplacement services. Besides getting help for herself, she
helps others where she can, such as giving a talk on money-saving
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney says she saw Global Crossing deteriorating under the
weight of heavy spending and dwindling demand from a glut of
fiber-optic cable. But like others in the company, she was confused
by mixed signals the company was giving.</TE>
<TE>   The company started cutting its work force early last spring, just
as it was handing out its biggest bonuses ever. And as layoffs
increased in late spring, it opened a major call-center operation in
Montreal. In July, it handed out more bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a puzzling backdrop," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Mahoney is hoping that some of the more upbeat local
economists, researchers and planners are right in their views that
the Rochester area's small new firms, including telecom companies,
will once again work their magic and pick up those who have lost
their jobs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Apartment Investment &amp; Management Co., the No. 2 U.S. apartment
owner, completed its $822-million purchase of 17,383 apartments from
Beverly Hills-based Casden Properties to gain more properties in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Apartment Investment paid $206 million in stock and $198 million
in cash. The deal also includes $418 million earmarked for apartments
Casden is developing. Apartment Investment is assuming $673 million
in debt.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase will add 11 cents to 14 cents a share to Apartment
Investment's funds from operations in 2002, increasing earnings for
the year to $5.31 to $5.54 a share, the company said. That compares
with analysts' expectation of $5.35 a share, based on the average
estimate of Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   The Denver-based real estate investment trust, also known as
Aimco, earlier said it would invest as much as $50 million for a 20%
stake in closely held Casden, to gain the right to buy apartments

<HD>Agency Probes Possible Enron Commodity Fraud</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Commission is looking into energy company's
trading on New York Mercantile Exchange and online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government is investigating whether Enron Corp. committed fraud
or manipulated markets through improper trading, the chairman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   CFTC Chairman James Newsome said the agency was using its
anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority to investigate Enron's
trading on commodity exchanges, notably the New York Mercantile
Exchange, as well as its own big online trading system.</LD>
<LD>   The system, called EnronOnline, was the world's first
commodity-trading platform based on the Web.</LD>
<TE>   Enron was the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas and
the country's leading electricity trader. The Houston-based company
also started new trading markets in telecommunications bandwidth,
pulp, paper, plastics and the influence of the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spiraled downward into the biggest corporate bankruptcy in
U.S. history on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Newsome said the CFTC last fall began an inquiry into Enron's
trading that later became a formal investigation. Enron spokesmen had
no immediate comment on the CFTC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Enron became one of the largest traders of energy
derivatives--financial contracts used to hedge or speculate on a
commodity. Businesses buy them to guard against losses from
unexpected market movements while speculators buy them as high-risk
bets, hoping for huge returns.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have maintained that the multi-trillion-dollar global
market in over-the-counter derivatives--which are traded outside
commodity exchanges--should continue to be exempt from regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, which was among Bush's biggest campaign contributors,
lobbied throughout the government and Congress against regulation of
electricity markets and the trading of derivatives tied to energy
commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Lee Gramm, an Enron director and member of the board's audit
committee, was chairwoman of the CFTC before she joined the Enron
board in 1993. As head of the agency, she shepherded an exemption
from government oversight for the trading of energy products, which
benefited Enron and other energy-traders. Gramm is married to Sen.
Phil Gramm (R-Texas), former chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, the CFTC doesn't have the authority to regulate
over-the-counter or electronic derivatives trading but is empowered
to investigate if it suspects fraud or market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) recently proposed legislation
that would restore full oversight authority to the CFTC.</TE>

<HD>Cisco SEC Filing Details Plans to Buy 3 Start-Ups</HD>
<DH>Tech: Company gives unusually specific information to ease
investors' concerns over accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc., looking to ease investor concern about its
accounting practices, provided an unusually detailed amount of
financial information in a regulatory filing Monday, including the
financing of four start-ups.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose maker of computer-networking equipment said it will
buy three closely held start-up companies within six months for as
much as $500 million in stock.</LD>
<LD>   Cisco, in a quarterly report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said it has already invested $38 million in the
unidentified companies.</LD>
<TE>   A fourth start-up may be purchased by July 2004 for up to $2.5
billion in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cisco has historically funded much of its research and
development by buying young companies for Cisco stock, it has
recently invested in start-ups, agreeing to acquire them only if
certain technology and research milestones are met.</TE>
<TE>   The company also reclassified revenue adjustments and deferrals
after investors said last month that Cisco didn't adequately explain
how fiscal second-quarter revenue rose 8.3% from the prior period.
The shares fell 8% on Feb. 7, the day after the results were
released.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco distributed a $334-million negative revenue adjustment and a
positive $45-million revenue deferral among five categories of
products and services, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In reclassifying revenue among routers, switches, access devices
and other products, Cisco is backing out revenue adjustments and
deferrals from the appropriate product and geographic categories, to
make it easier for investors to gauge trends of Cisco's businesses
and geographic regions.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco shares fell 38 cents to $17.42 on Nasdaq and declined to
$17.37 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk-show host Oprah Winfrey will end her show after the 2005-06
television season after renewing her current contract for two years,
the 20th anniversary of the program's premiere in national
syndication.</LD>
<LD>   Winfrey's current contract runs through the 2003-04 TV season.

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares in AOL Latin America had their biggest one-day decline in four
months after just one of the controlling partners put up cash to
continue funding the unprofitable Internet service provider.</LD>
<LD>   Shares in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company fell 13% to
$2.64, 10 cents above its all-time low.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner Inc. said it will lend up to $160 million to its
Latin American joint venture in exchange for bonds convertible into
stocks to finance the money-losing unit through 2002. Venezuela's
Cisneros Group and Brazil's Banco Itau, the other two partners, did
not put up any of the cash.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Latin America, which has not made a profit since its initial
public offering at the beginning of 2000, had a loss of $70.5 million
in the fourth quarter of last year on revenue of $18.7 million
compared with a loss of $105.5 million in the year earlier period.</TE>

<HD>Disney, Carnival Face Higher Insurance Costs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s theme parks, Carnival Corp.'s cruise lines and
other businesses that host thousands of tourists are facing higher
insurance costs because of last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-based Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, said
last month in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that it may have trouble obtaining adequate levels of insurance
coverage. Theme park operator Six Flags Inc. said last week that its
insurance expense will rise 40% this year.</LD>
<LD>   The higher costs come as companies such as Disney are trying to
climb out of a sales slump. U.S. consumers cut back on travel last
year because of the economic recession and fears of flying after the
Sept. 11 hijackings.</LD>
<TE>   The average theme-park operator spends about 4% to 5% of its
revenue on insurance premiums, said Dennis Speigel, president of
International Theme Park Services Inc., a consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance premiums at Cedar Fair, an owner of six theme parks
including Knott's Berry Farm near Los Angeles, will rise by more than
10% this year, spokesman Brian Witherow said.</TE>

<HD>Wholesale Sales Rise 1.2% in January</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales at U.S. wholesalers showed the largest gain in 19 months in
January and inventories dropped to a two-year low, signs of a
rebounding economy that will stimulate factory production.</LD>
<LD>   The 1.2% rise in sales was the first since August and the largest
since June 2000, the Commerce Department reported. Stockpiles fell
0.2% in January, the eighth consecutive decline, and their value
declined to $287.7 billion, the lowest since January 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "Sales are so strong that inventories are getting even thinner,"
said Joseph LaVorgna, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
in New York. "You are going to get more production, employment and
income growth because inventories are going to be rebuilt."</LD>
<TE>   The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long goods remain
on storeroom shelves, fell to 1.28 months, the lowest since March
2000. U.S. retail chains, including Best Buy Co. and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., reported last month the biggest monthly gain in sales in almost
two years, opening the way for orders to increase at distributors and
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Factories, wholesalers and retailers pared inventories by a record
$120 billion at an annual rate from October to December, according to
previous data from the Commerce Department. Consumer spending grew
during the quarter at a 6% annual rate, the fastest in 31/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesalers account for about one-fourth of all business
stockpiles. Retailers and factories account for the rest. Last week,
the Commerce Department reported a 0.6% decline in January factory
inventories, the smallest decrease in eight months, after a 0.9% drop
a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Record sales of existing homes in January may be affecting other
spending. Wholesale sales of durable goods rose 1.3% in January, led
by building materials and furniture, after falling 0.7% in December.
Durable goods inventories fell 0.4% in January, led by autos and
parts, metals and furniture, after declining 1.1%.</TE>

<HD>L90 Removes CFO, Calls Off Merger</HD>
<DH>Internet: Moves come weeks after the SEC said it is looking
into how online marketer recognized revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an
investigation into L90 Inc., the Marina del Rey-based online marketer
said Monday that it removed its top financial officer and ended a
pending merger with entertainment firm EUniverse Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer Thomas Sebastian has been placed on
administrative leave, and Chief Executive and President John Bohan
has resigned.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Cannold, former chief operating officer of the Web site
Space.com, will replace Bohan.</LD>
<TE>   EUniverse announced in early January that it would acquire L90,
and expected the cash deal to be worth as much as $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, designed to help EUniverse expand its audience in a
tightening Internet advertising market, was put on hold when L90
disclosed last month the SEC had issued subpoenas to the company and
at least one of its board members.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies will continue to negotiate a cash reimbursement
by L90 to cover pre-merger expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't reasonably predict when the investigation would end,"
said EUniverse CEO Brad Greenspan. "We made a mutual decision to
terminate the existing merger agreement."</TE>
<TE>   L90 executives declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Company sources who have seen the SEC subpoenas, however, said
federal investigators are looking into how L90 structured its
advertising deals, as well as how the company recognized certain
revenue on its balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's news comes only days after company co-founder Mark Roah
resigned from the company's board, citing personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in L90 shares was halted Monday before the market opened.
On Friday, the stock closed at $1.21 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Sharp Pump Price Increase Continues</HD>
<DH>Energy: Gasoline jumps 12 cents a gallon in California in a
single week, the steepest gain of any state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices spurted higher nationwide in the last week led by a
12-cent jump in California's average per-gallon pump price, an
increase blamed on refinery problems, higher oil prices and rising
demand.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles motorists got the worst of it, paying an average of
$1.444 a gallon, up about 14 cents, for self-serve regular gasoline,
according to a weekly survey of 800 service stations released Monday
by the Energy Information Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. increase of 7.9 cents per gallon was the second-largest
on record, bringing the average price of self-serve regular gasoline
to $1.223 per gallon. A year ago, the price was nearly 19 cents per
gallon higher.</LD>
<TE>   California prices rose more than any other state, increasing to
$1.454 per gallon. Last year at this time, the average price in
California was $1.70 per gallon. In San Francisco, the weekly average
increased 9.7 cents to $1.44 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices are reacting to reduced supply brought about by
routine refinery maintenance as well as more serious refinery
problems in California and Texas. In addition, demand for gasoline is
up because of the economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Strong oil prices, boosted by fears of war with Iraq, also are
pushing gasoline prices higher, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil and gas futures hit the highest prices in nearly six
months Monday. The April contract for West Texas intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark, closed at $24.31 a barrel, up 47 cents, on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Gas futures for April delivery reached 79.1
cents a gallon, up 2.29 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale prices in California leaped about 25 cents a gallon last
week primarily due to outages at the Valero Energy Corp. refinery in
Wilmington and the ChevronTexaco Corp. refinery in Richmond.
California refinery problems immediately boost prices because few
refineries outside the state can produce California's cleaner-burning
gasoline, which is mandated by air pollution regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Those refineries are coming back on line and routine maintenance
at other refineries is ending, which is calming spot gasoline markets
in California, said Mark Mahoney, West Coast market analyst for Oil
Price Information Service, a Lakewood, N.J., firm that tracks gas
prices. The latest AAA gas numbers, supplied by OPIS, show gasoline
prices up in California and nationwide, although not as much as in
the EIA survey.</TE>
<TE>   Prices should moderate for a few weeks, barring new refinery
breakdowns or significant oil price increases, but will begin rising
again with the start of the summer driving season, Mahoney said.</TE>

<HD>IBM Issues New Accounting Details in 2001 Annual Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. on Monday published new accounting details in its 2001
annual report, under pressure from investors.</LD>
<LD>   The report showed how earnings from its pension plan boosted
Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM's earnings by about $800 million in 2001,
disclosed write-downs for investments and broke out other expenses
and gains that had been lumped into catch-all accounting categories
investors have begun to fear.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 1 computer maker had raised a storm of protest by
accounting for a sale of optical transceiver technology as operating
profit rather than a one-time gain.</LD>
<TE>   Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi dropped his rating on
IBM to "market perform" from "outperform" Monday, largely because he
expects IBM's services division to post lower growth.</TE>
<TE>   But he said IBM's financial disclosures could prompt investors to
rethink company performance.</TE>
<TE>   A number of analysts say that IBM has not misled investors but has
not been as detailed as it could have been.</TE>
<TE>   In the annual report, IBM reported that income was boosted by its
pension investments by $841 million in 2001, up from $728 million the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of IBM closed up 15 cents to $105.24 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Kmart Names New CEO</HD>
<DH>Retail: Chairman and turnaround specialist James Adamson
replaces Charles Conaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beleaguered Kmart Corp. replaced its chief executive Monday, in a
management shake-up just three days after the discount retailer
outlined plans to shut down 284 stores and dismiss 22,000 workers
nationwide</LD>
<LD>   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer said Charles C. Conaway, 41, had
resigned and was immediately replaced by turnaround specialist James
B. Adamson. The move was not a complete surprise because Adamson, a
Kmart board member since 1996, replaced Conaway as chairman shortly
before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old Adamson, who steered  Advantica Restaurant Group
Inc. and drugstore chain Revco D.S. Inc. through bankruptcy
reorganizations, said his immediate goal is to stabilize the
company--focusing on workers, on the firm's  relationship with
suppliers and on keeping stores clean and well-stocked to regain
customers.</LD>
<TE>   But Adamson was short on details and did not venture an answer to
a key question that investors and consumers are asking: How will the
company compete against discount price leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and the trendier Target Corp.?</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a new chief executive officer and chairman of the
board who says the same things" Conaway did, retail expert Kurt
Barnard said. "I'm very much afraid that the basics alone will not
bring Kmart customers back."</TE>
<TE>   Adamson acknowledged Monday that Kmart must better define itself,
saying a strategy to differentiate itself from competitors should be
completed by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take some time to really analyze where the business
is today--where its strengths are [and] where its opportunities are,"
Adamson said.</TE>
<TE>   Conaway's departure comes less than two years after he was hired.
Analysts said he made significant blunders, including launching a
doomed price war with Wal-Mart. Conaway could not be reached for
comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Kmart will try to build upon is its licensing agreements
with some strong brands, including Martha Stewart, Disney and Sesame
Street. The company has asked the Bankruptcy Court to let it keep its
agreements with these suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson said he expects the relationship with Stewart, Kmart's
most known brand, to continue and grow stronger. He acknowledged that
Kmart must stabilize its relationship with its vendors, including
Fleming Cos.,  Kmart's only grocery supplier.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas-based Fleming said Monday that it is shaving about 20
cents a share from its earnings projections this year and next
largely because of the upheaval at Kmart. But Fleming applauded
Kmart's store closures, saying that by shuttering the least
productive stores, both companies will be better able to "move the
remaining business forward."</TE>
<TE>   The change in chief executives was part of a larger management
restructuring that included the naming of Julian C. Day as president
and chief operating officer, positions that previously were vacant.
Day has been COO at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Also, Albert A. Koch,
chairman of turnaround management firm Jay Alix &amp; Associates, was
named chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares closed at $1.45, up 16 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>School District Closes 3 Lease Deals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has completed three office
lease transactions valued at $14.1million. The leases include new
offices in the City of Commerce and the Media Tech Center north of
downtown Los Angeles, along with the extension of a lease at a
downtown high-rise.</LD>
<LD>   The largest of the three involves the relocation of the district's
transportation branch from a site near downtown to about 35,000
square feet at the new Media Tech Center, east of the interchange of
the Golden State and Glendale freeways. The 10-year lease with the
developer--an affiliate of Legacy Partners Commercial--is valued at
$5.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   Trammell Crow Co.'s Jonathan Larsen and Lisa St. John represented
the school district in the lease negotiations. David Harding, Peter
Poulson and Kevin Duffy of CB Richard Ellis negotiated for the
developers.</LD>
<TE>   LAUSD agreed to relocate administrative operations of its District
J from downtown L.A. to a facility in Commerce, which is closer to
District J schools. That 10-year deal covering 22,500 square feet at
5800 S. Eastern Ave. is valued at about $5.7 million. Holly Forsythe
represented landlord Abby Co. Trammell Crow's Larsen, St. John and
Tom Sheets negotiated for LAUSD.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified also extended the lease on some of its offices at 611
W. 6th St. for an additional 30 months. Though the District J group
will vacate that property, other operations will remain within 52,500
square feet of offices there.</TE>
<TE>   Those include the District I group, for which the Trammell Crow
team is negotiating a possible move to a planned office development
on property owned by First AME Church subsidiary Grant Housing
Partnership at 103rd Street and Central Avenue, Larsen said.</TE>
<TE>   The downtown lease extension is valued at $2.5 million. St. John
and Larsen negotiated for the district. Stephen Koile of Metcom
Management represented property owner 611 W. 6th Street Associates.</TE>

<HD>Dow Close Highest Since June</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors bet on an improving economy, but
worries over rapid stock rise and Mideast tensions temper enthusiasm,
analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks crawled higher Monday as more investors pushed into
the market, fearful of missing out on a continuing rally tied to the
economy's apparent rebound.</LD>
<LD>   But the Nasdaq composite index surrendered a midday rally and
closed slightly lower, as profit-taking hit some tech issues.</LD>
<LD>   Still, winners edged losers on Nasdaq and on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "The entire focus of the market has shifted away from what can go
wrong to now a better balance between what could go wrong and what
could go right," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm
LibertyView. "The economic news has been incredibly good."</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.75 points, or
0.4%, to 10,611.24, its highest close since June 21.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index slipped less than a point to
1,929.49. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 3.95 points, or 0.3%,
to 1,168.26.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE observed two minutes of silence before the opening to
mark six months since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The attacks
shuttered Wall Street for nearly a week--the longest shutdown since
the Depression--and prompted a massive sell-off when the market
reopened.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow has climbed 29% from its post-attack lows, the Nasdaq is
up 36% and the S&amp;P 500 has advanced nearly 21%.</TE>
<TE>   The broad market erased early losses Monday, adding to strong
gains last week, as investors bet the U.S. economy is on the mend.
The Nasdaq index surged 7% last week.</TE>
<TE>   But worries that stocks have come too far, too fast as well as
concerns about growing tensions in the Middle East kept investors'
enthusiasm in check, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The government reported that sales at U.S. wholesalers had the
largest gain in 19 months in January and inventories dropped to a
two-year low, continuing a recent string of upbeat economic news that
has prompted policymakers to declare an end to the recession.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts caution, however, that a rebound could be mild and stock
valuations are creeping ahead of the historical average.</TE>
<TE>   Banking giant J.P. Morgan was among the Dow's biggest gainers,
rising $1.56 to $36.30. The company said it wants to cut costs 10% to
15% and financial weekly Barron's reported bargain-hunters were
taking interest in the stock.</TE>
<TE>   American Express, another Dow stock, gained $1.08 to $41.55 after
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market was quiet. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note, which surged to an eight-month high Friday, was
unchanged at 5.32%.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Networking company Ciena jumped $1.02 to $10.29, and its
acquisition target ONI Systems rose 56 cents to $7.11 on speculation
Cisco Systems would buy them both, Reuters reported. Cisco fell 38
cents to $17.42.</TE>
<TE>   Other networking heavyweights also climbed. Corning rose $1.05 to
$8.90 and Juniper Networks gained $1.40 to $14.71.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor shares eroded recent gains. Chip giant Intel lost
75 cents to $33.42, and the SOX semiconductor index dropped 2.4%.
Chip maker Intersil fell $5.48 to $31.17 after saying it plans to buy
Elantec Semiconductor for about $1.4 billion to expand into
additional markets such as those for optical storage chips used in
compact discs and DVDs as well as flat-panel displays. Elantec
rallied $4.57 to $45.77.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil shares rallied as crude prices rose again on escalating
Mideast tensions. Exxon Mobil rose 58 cents to $43.49, tracking the
rise in oil prices. ChevronTexaco rose $1.45 to $89.10. Crude oil
futures rose 47 cents to $24.31 in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense shares rose. Northrop Grumman was up $2.54 to $108.46,
Lockheed Martin climbed $1.01 to $57.75 and General Dynamics gained
$3.85 to $90.85.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Not Sold on Retail Mergers</HD>
<DH>Deals: Speculation centers on talks between Federated and
May department store chains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest department store companies, among retailing's worst
performers in the last year, might be hoping to consolidate their way
out of trouble.</LD>
<LD>   But analysts and others say a flurry of deals is unlikely. And,
they add, merging alone is not the answer to more successfully
competing with discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kohl's
Corp. and Target Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The latest merger speculation was sparked Monday by reported talks
between the nation's two largest department store companies,
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Bloomingdales and Macy's,
and May Department Store Co., owner of Robinson's May.</LD>
<TE>   That report in the Wall Street Journal fueled speculation about
other acquisitions among department stores, which have suffered from
declining mall traffic and eroding sales after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But, experts say, any meaningful deal between Federated and May is
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't happen," said Bob Buchanan, a department stores analyst
with A.G. Edwards. "I doubt that we will see May and Federated merge
in my lifetime, chiefly because the two companies don't like each
other, and I know enough senior executives at both companies to say
that."</TE>
<TE>   Investors showed no significant reaction to the news Monday.
Federated shares gained 23 cents to $43.70 and May shares lost 16
cents to $36.48, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other combinations, focusing on the few regional chains not
swallowed up in the ilast round of consolidations in the 1980s and
1990s, don't make sense in the short term, Buchanan and others said.</TE>
<TE>   Possible targets include Dillard's Inc., a 340-store
Arkansas-based chain with stores throughout the South and Midwest. It
has suffered declining sales and earnings, particularly after its
$3.1-billion purchase of Mercantile Stores, despite moves to lure
more moderate customers.</TE>
<TE>   Dillard's, however, is family controlled and operated. And thus
far, it is more interested in being the acquirer than the acquired.
Dillard's stock fell 32 cents to $22.48 Monday on the Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno, Calif.-based Gottschalks Inc. is another oft-cited
possible acquisition. It has 86 smaller-city department stores in
California, Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and
in 2000 added the Seattle-based Lamonts chain of 34 stores.
Gottschalks' earnings not including tax and charges fell 88% last
year despite an 8.5% sales gain.</TE>
<TE>   However, investors drove Gottschalks stock up 62 cents, or 21%, to
$3.60 on the New York Stock Exchange in volume that was far higher
than normal for the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Still another rumored target is the department store divisions of
Target Corp., which includes Mervyn's and Marshall Fields. Also on
the list is Saks Inc., which owns the Parisian, Younkers, Carson
Pirie Scott and Proffitt's stores. It previously has talked of
separating its luxury Saks Fifth Avenue from the more moderate stores
group.</TE>
<TE>   "Consolidation is inevitable in the longer term, but the holdouts
have held out for various reasons," said Gilbert W. Harrison,
chairman of Financo Inc., an investment bank that focuses on the
merchandising sector. "The problem is not how do the department
stores become larger and consolidate, but rather how do they reinvent
themselves to get the consumer to shop there?"</TE>
<TE>   The companies declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts said the rumors have a ring of truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're likely to see any number of combinations proposed
and some actually occur, because it has to happen," said Todd Slater
of Lazard Freres in New York.</TE>
<TE>   If the department store sector shrinks, the effect on California
could be dramatic, creating a glut of retail real estate and hitting
an important local sector, apparel manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be consolidation, there has to be," Buchanan said.
"But it's probably a ways down the road....My bet is that you will
not see major consolidation activity over the next year in the
department store world."</TE>

<LD>TRW Inc.'s board and senior executives have been named in the first
shareholder lawsuit since the auto parts and defense equipment maker
rejected Northrop Grumman Corp.'s takeover bid.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks to force the board to "adequately consider"
Northrop's now hostile $11.4-billion bid. Arthur Posner and Rachel
Hirsch charge that TRW's board is ignoring its duty to increase
shareholder value.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern Ohio
eastern division, also seeks class-action status.</LD>

<LD>U.S. property and casualty insurers paid $24 billion in claims last
year--the largest amount ever--largely because of the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The amount could be adjusted higher because of pending lawsuits
related to Sept. 11, according to the Insurance Services Office, a
Jersey City, N.J., advisory company that issued the report.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, in 2000, property and casualty insurers paid $4.3
billion in claims.</LD>
<TE>   Insurers paid $16.6 billion in claims related to the terrorist
attacks. Previously, the largest amount paid by insurers for a single
event was $15.5 billion for losses caused by Hurricane Andrew in
Florida in 1992.</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $13 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.825%, up from 1.76% last week. An additional $13
billion was sold in six-month bills at 2.02%, up from 1.89%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since Nov. 26, when the bills
sold for 1.92%. The six-month rate was the highest since Oct. 22,
when it was 2.13%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.858% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,953.90, and 2.069% for a six-month bill selling for $9,897.90.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield

<LD>The airline industry won't recover from the terrorist attacks for
another year, the government says, but growth later in the decade
will overwhelm the air traffic system if it isn't improved.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration, releasing its forecasts in
conjunction with its annual conference, said the number of passengers
on U.S. airlines is expected to decline this year compared with last.
Not until later in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 will the skies
beckon again, the FAA said.</LD>

<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Barclays are among international
creditors that may take a stake in Argentina's biggest publicly
traded bank to avert its collapse, the chairman of the nation's
deposit insurance fund said.</LD>
<LD>   The foreign lenders, which also include Bank of America Corp.,
Dresdner Bank and the World Bank's International Finance Corp.,
signed letters of intent to convert as much as $400 million of loans
to Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires into shares, said Jose Jaime, who
heads Seguro de Depositos and has participated in the bailout talks.
The deposit insurance fund, which the government controls, also will
provide financing for the rescue.</LD>
<LD>   Banco Galicia ran short of cash after depositors accelerated
withdrawals last year as a recession deepened.</LD>

<LD>Boeing Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Phil Condit expanded the
roles of three top executives and elevated them to the chairman's
office, potentially narrowing the field of those likeliest to succeed
him.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer Mike Sears, Chief Technology Officer David
Swain and newly named Chief People and Administration Officer
Laurette Koellner were promoted by the world's biggest aerospace
company and commercial jet maker.</LD>
<LD>   Condit said the moves were prompted by three pending
retirements--Vice Chairman Harry Stonecipher in June; Jim Dagnon,
senior vice president for people, in May; and John Warner, senior
vice president and chief administrative officer, in July.</LD>
<TE>   The 60-year-old Condit did not directly answer questions about
when he intends to retire. Boeing shares rose $1.48 to $50.88 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Israeli real estate firm has purchased a 288,000-square-foot
Hawthorne data center leased to AT&amp;T Corp. The sale marks the first
Southern California investment for Red Sea Group, whose U.S.
operations are based in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   Red Sea is believed to have paid more than $43 million for the
former Northrop Grumman Corp. facility built in 1963 at 2301 W. 120th
St. Tel Aviv-based Red Sea purchased the property from Seattle's
Sabey Corp., which bought the facility after Northrop vacated the
premises and subsequently negotiated a 15-year lease with AT&amp;T.</LD>
<LD>   The data center, or Web-hosting real estate category, was very
active until the telecom sector began hitting the skids two years
ago. But Red Sea Vice President Mitch Kralis said his firm was
attracted to the Hawthorne facility's long-term lease with a
corporate giant and believes the area is "up-and-coming."</LD>
<TE>   Mortgage banker L.J. Melody &amp; Co. helped Red Sea secure
acquisition financing from Royal Insurance Co. Patrick Pendergast of
Washington Partners brokered the property sale.</TE>
<TE>   Kralis said Red Sea wants to buy additional income-producing real
estate in Southern California and has the capital to close
transactions quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Red Sea has engaged an agent to sell its Bourbon Street
Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Earl Scheib Inc. said its operating loss narrowed to $1.57 million in
its fiscal third quarter from a loss of $2.23 million a year ago,
helped in part by lower administrative costs. The Sherman Oaks-based
company said sales at its auto paint and body shops open at least a
year jumped 7.7%. Total sales declined 1.5% to $10.2 million, as the
company operated 26 fewer shops in the latest quarter than in the
year-ago period.</LD>
<LD>   Earl Scheib's net loss was $778,000, or 18 cents a share, compared
with $2.3 million, or 53 cents, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which operates 135 shops in more than 100 cities,
said it plans to close at least seven more shops by the end of the
next fiscal year.</LD>
<TE>   Its shares rose 10 cents to $2.70 on the American Stock Exchange,
before the results were announced.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sport Chalet Inc. said earnings will miss analyst expectations for
its fiscal fourth quarter, primarily because unseasonably warm and
dry weather has dampened demand for snowboards, skis and other winter
goods at its stores.</LD>
<LD>   Total sales during January and February were down 1.1% from the
year-ago period, and sales at stores open at least a year plunged
8.8%, it said. Excluding winter goods, same-store sales were up 4.1%
in the two-month period.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts were expecting La Canada-based Sport Chalet to post
earnings of 15 cents a share for the quarter. The company said it
could not give an earnings forecast because it expects sales to
fluctuate for the rest of the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Sport Chalet shares closed up 3 cents at $10.13 on Nasdaq, before
the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Cities See Red in Kmart Closings</HD>
<DH>Retail: The loss of sales tax revenue could have a big
effect on budgets of small municipalities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pending closure of 16 Kmart Corp. stores across California won't
make much of a ripple in the state's giant real estate market and
economy.</LD>
<LD>   But on a local level, the store closures announced last week as
part of the company's reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court are
expected to have a profound effect on small property owners and
cities that are heavily dependent on the discount store chain for
rent and sales tax revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of a large Kmart store could translate into the loss
of $200,000 to $300,000 in annual sales tax revenue in addition to
job cuts, said real estate consultant Larry Kosmont.</LD>
<TE>   The loss may take a painful toll on small cities that are slated
to lose a Kmart, including Compton, Fountain Valley and La Verne.</TE>
<TE>   "For many communities, that [amount] is the equivalent of two to
three police cars fully manned," said Kosmont. "Each city ... has to
create a plan to deal with the loss quickly. If they don't they are
foolish."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is slated to lose three Kmart stores, but the effect
on the city's treasury will be minimal given the city's tax base and
the legion of rival stores that will pick up former Kmart shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the closing of three Kmarts in the much-smaller
Central Valley city of Fresno is expected to have a larger effect
fiscally.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a city that has limited retail resources, and your
Kmart closes, it's going to pinch," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "Fresno really
got hammered."</TE>
<TE>   The Kmart stores to be closed in dense urban areas are expected to
be scooped up by other major retail chains, such as Target Corp. or
Home Depot Inc., or speedily recycled into other uses because of the
shortage of developable land, say retail and real estate observers.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part they will be absorbed into the retail community
fairly rapidly," said Brent Howell, a retail real estate broker at CB
Richard Ellis. "Some of these sites will take longer than others but
we have always been able to fill the void."</TE>
<TE>   But finding and moving in a replacement tenant could take several
months under the best of circumstances, leaving individual property
owners and city officials without rental and tax income for a
significant amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   The wait could be much longer if the property needs to be
redeveloped for other uses, such as housing, schools or offices.</TE>
<TE>   "They [landlords] are going to be challenged," said Michael
Zugsmith, chairman of NAI Capital Commercial, a real estate brokerage
and investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a substandard location ... you could be sitting with
that empty space for a year or more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In La Verne, located at the eastern edge of Los Angeles County,
the upcoming closure of the Kmart on Foothill Boulevard has city
officials preparing to work with property owners to market the site
and find other tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The store is one of the city's largest sources of sales tax
revenue--about $2.7 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart was in the top five," said City Manager Martin R. Lomeli.
"Their loss will certainly be felt in our budget for next year."</TE>
<TE>   Lomeli said the fiscal effect on the city will be softened a bit
as La Verne's remaining retailers, including a Target store, capture
some of Kmart's sales, and contribute more sales tax to the city
treasury.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kohl's, a fast-growing discount department store, has
filed permits to open a store in the city.</TE>
<TE>   That could help replace some of Kmart's sales tax revenue but
Kohl's is not scheduled to open until spring 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a void to fill in our community," said Lomeli, "and we
will work hard to fill it."</TE>

<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., owner of the fifth-largest U.S. bank, voted
against Hewlett-Packard Co.'s proposed $22.7-billion purchase of
Compaq Computer Corp. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment
on the decision. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo owned about 4.5
million shares of HP as of December. Wells Fargo's opposition strikes
another blow to HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who's fighting to
get enough support to win a March 19 shareholder vote.</LD>

<LD>After disabling a copyright-flouting supplier of online movies,
Taiwan's largest phone company is teaming with CinemaNow Inc. to
provide a legitimate movies-on-demand service. Chunghwa Telecom plans
to use movies from Marina del Rey-based CinemaNow to offer an
English-language movie channel to high-speed Internet subscribers.
The controversial Movie88 site had used Chunghwa's network to offer a
wide selection of English, Chinese and Japanese for $1 per viewing,
but Chunghwa knocked the service off line at the request of the
Motion Picture Assn. of America.</LD>

<LD>Avaya Inc.'s corporate credit rating was cut to "junk" status by
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. on concern that cost-cutting measures won't
help the biggest maker of office telephone equipment overcome weak
demand. Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Avaya's corporate credit rating to
BB-plus from BBB-minus and withdrew ratings on the company's
short-term corporate credit and commercial paper. Avaya shares fell
31 cents to $5.95 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Tenet Says Profit Will Exceed Analysts' Estimates</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp. on Monday lifted expectations
for earnings in its fiscal third quarter, helped in part by more
frequent visits by older patients and cost controls.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company said profit from operations for
the quarter ended Feb. 28 would "comfortably" exceeded the average
estimate of 81 cents a share of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call. The company did not provide an exact estimate.
In the year-ago period, Tenet earned 60 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   It plans to release its results April 4.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet has been concentrating on more profitable services such as
cardiology to attract patients.</TE>
<TE>   It also reduced interest expense by repaying some debt. Admissions
to hospitals owned more than a year rose about 2%, even though the
U.S. flu season was the weakest in years, Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet reiterated that it expected earnings from operations to grow
at least 35% in fiscal 2002. Analysts surveyed by First Call expect
Tenet to earn $3.12 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet shares rose 69 cents to $61 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Profit Increases 58% at Williams-Sonoma</HD>
<DH>Retail: Sales climb at namesake and Pottery Barn stores as
shoppers stock up on houseware items.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. on Monday reported a 58% jump in profit for its
fiscal fourth quarter as the cookware and furniture retailer reduced
expenses and boosted sales at its namesake and Pottery Barn stores.</LD>
<LD>   But shares of San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma fell $2.64, or
5.4%, to $46.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares hit a
52-week high of $49.62 on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts said investors were expecting the company to exceed
profit forecasts it made two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   "People had expected them to report better than what the company
guided," said Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Joan Bogucki-Storms,
who rates Williams-Sonoma a "buy" and doesn't own any of the
company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer said its upscale Pottery Barn chain posted
particularly strong results, as shoppers stocked up on holiday items,
linens and furniture. It also improved its gross margins through
aggressive inventory management, which led to less promotional
activity, and lower merchandise and freight costs.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have said Williams-Sonoma and other home-oriented
retailers have benefited from people spending more time at home since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and from a boom in the housing
market.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma said net income for the quarter ended Feb.3 jumped
to $70.4 million, or $1.20 a share, from $44.5 million, or 79 cents,
a year earlier. Sales increased 17% to $787.4million.</TE>
<TE>   Results were a penny short of the $1.21 average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts raised their estimate from $1.16 after Williams-Sonoma
said Feb. 25 that earnings in the year just ended would be as much as
$1.32 a share.</TE>
<TE>   During the quarter, sales at stores open at least a year rose 7%
and 7.3% at Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn, respectively, the
company said. Pottery Barn Kids same-store sales climbed 13%, the
retailer said. Same-store sales at Hold Everything declined 16.7%.</TE>
<TE>   For the current fiscal year, the company said it was keeping its
earlier earnings guidance of $1.52 to $1.56 a share, compared with
$1.32 for the year just ended.</TE>

<HD>Alan Manson, 83; Soldier Turned Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Manson, one of a host of World War II soldiers recruited to
appear in Irving Berlin's 1942 musical and subsequent movie "This Is
the Army," who went on to act on Broadway, television and film, has
died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Manson died of undisclosed causes on March 5 in New York City's
Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously delighted with his assignment, then Sgt. Manson
portrayed a stiff interlocutor in the first part of Berlin's historic
morale-boosting stage revue. In the second half, he dressed in drag
as "Jane Cowl" in the Stage Door Canteen production.</LD>
<TE>   He kept in touch with other members of the Army troupe, one of the
first integrated units in the military, long after they played
Broadway, toured the nation and the world with the popular show.</TE>
<TE>   In its three-year run, the show raised $15 million for the Army
Emergency Relief Fund. The 1943 film version starred future U.S. Sen.
George Murphy as the father of future president Lt. Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The Broadway cast members proved so popular with Eleanor Roosevelt
that she invited them to Washington to perform for her husband. After
the presentation at the National Theater on Oct. 8, 1942, Manson
recalled the thrill of meeting their commander in chief, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a night none of us will ever forget," he later told Berlin
biographer Laurence Bergreen. "Roosevelt ... stayed up until 1:30 in
the morning, shaking hands with all 359 men in the company. Mrs.
Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins were there. No one could go to sleep
after that. We just sat up talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Manson went on to perform in the hit Broadway revue "Call Me
Mister," Rogers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" and "Angels Kiss Me." But
in 1955, his stage career hit a snag when he was called before a
House committee investigating communists in New York theater.</TE>
<TE>   Invoking the 1st, 5th and 9th amendments and his belief in
privacy, Manson refused to answer any questions. "I feel that these
matters lie within a province that is hallowed," he said, "and that I
spent five years in the Army for."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was later cleared, Manson found so little work as an
actor for a few years that he was forced to earn his living as a tour
guide. In 1959, he returned to the boards in Paddy Chayefsky's "The
Tenth Man," then "Gideon."</TE>
<TE>   But for the last four decades, Manson devoted himself primarily to
character roles in television and motion pictures, often portraying
an authority figure such as a judge.</TE>
<TE>   He had a regular role in the soap opera "The Edge of Night" for
many years, and appeared in such popular series as "M*A*S*H,"
"Kojak," "McMillan and Wife," "The Bob Newhart Show," "The Rockford
Files," "Three's Company," "Columbo" and "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   Manson is survived by his wife of less than a year, Corey Rose
Lang, and his brother, Arthur.</TE>

<HD>Bill Radovich, 87; NFL Star Blacklisted After Court Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Radovich, a former pro football lineman and the first player to
take the NFL to court over the right to play for the team of his
choice, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Radovich died Wednesday in Newport Beach after a brief bout with
cancer. His death was announced Monday by USC, where he was a
letterman from 1935 through '37.</LD>
<LD>   A tenacious guard and linebacker who played at 5 feet 8, 220
pounds, Radovich was an all-star for the Detroit Lions in 1939 and
1945. But he is best remembered for his legal wranglings with the
NFL.</LD>
<TE>   "Every sports law course starts with the Radovich case," said
Richard Berthelsen, general counsel for the NFL Players Assn. "That's
probably one of the first things students learn when they're studying
the history of professional football."</TE>
<TE>   After playing for Detroit from 1938 through '41, Radovich entered
the Navy and stayed there until the end of World War II. He was 30
when he rejoined the Lions for the 1945 season and, as he was nearing
the end of his career, he wanted to earn as much as he could right
away. Also, he wanted to be closer to his father, who was gravely ill
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, he informed the Lions he wanted to be traded to a West
Coast team, preferably the L.A. Rams, or at least earn more money so
he could fly back to see his father more often. Lion owner Fred Madel
Jr. refused both requests.</TE>
<TE>   "The little creep said I'd either play in Detroit or I wouldn't
play anywhere," Radovich told the New York Times in 1994. "He also
told me if I tried to play in the [All-America Football Conference],
he would put me on a blacklist for five years."</TE>
<TE>   Like many established NFL players, Radovich was lured to the new
league, which offered to double many players' salaries. He signed
with the Los Angeles Dons, playing for them in 1946 and '47; he
earned $300 for each game in the 12-game season.</TE>
<TE>   When the All-America Conference folded, Radovich tried to join the
San Francisco Clippers--who played in the NFL-affiliated Pacific
Coast Football League--as a player-coach. That's when he learned he
had been blacklisted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, Radovich sued the NFL and suffered a setback when the
case was dismissed by a lower court. Six years later, the U.S.
Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled in favor of Radovich, saying
all professional sports--except baseball--were subject to antitrust
laws. The court ordered that the case be retried.</TE>
<TE>   At the behest of his attorney, Maxwell Keith, Radovich reluctantly
dropped the case and accepted a $42,500 settlement from the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The groundbreaking Supreme Court decision had ramifications that
extended beyond football. Marvin Miller, former executive director of
the Major League Baseball Players Assn., was encouraged by the
Radovich case when his association first challenged baseball's
reserve clause in the late 1960s. After all, the court had said
baseball's long-standing exemption from antitrust laws was
"unreasonable, illogical and inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of guts to take on the NFL back then," Radovich
told the Chicago Tribune in 1992. "There was no union, no players
association, no legal fund. And we didn't make very much money. It
cost me a lot, but I knew I was right."</TE>
<TE>   After his playing career, Radovich worked as a position coach in
the Canadian Football League, then settled in Los Angeles. He was a
big supporter of USC football and a dedicated member of the Trojan
Football Alumni Club. He kept his job as an executive at Washington
Iron Works well into his 80s.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was playing football, he was tough and never gave up,"
said Al Abajian, who played for the Trojans 15 years after Radovich.
"He was a scratcher.... He wasn't afraid of anybody until his dying
day."</TE>
<TE>   Abajian became a widower in the early 1980s; Radovich never
married. The two were former Trojans, as well as Newport Beach
neighbors, and maintained a good friendship over the years. They met
for lunch at least twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   Abajian said Radovich was diagnosed with cancer about a month
before he died.</TE>
<TE>   "He never whimpered," Abajian said. "Never made a sound. One of
the last things he said to me was, 'Thanks for being such a good
friend.'"</TE>
<TE>   Radovich is survived by a brother, Walt, and a sister, Gloria Kaye
Clinton, both of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be Thursday at St. Sava Church in San
Gabriel.</TE>

<LD>Two San Fernando Valley men have been arrested in connection with a
telemarketing scheme in which they allegedly duped businesses across
the nation into buying overpriced and defective toner for copying
machines, the U.S. attorney's office said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Danny Yahalom, 35, of Encino and Oren Ben Elkanah, 50, of Tarzana
were named in a 45-count indictment that included allegations of
fraud, money laundering and filing false income tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the pair, operating as International Business
Network, bilked nearly three dozen companies out of about $150,000.</LD>

<LD>A former teacher at the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center was
sentenced to two years in federal prison Monday for using the
Internet to solicit sex with a onetime pupil.</LD>
<LD>   Guy Raz, 35, who pleaded guilty earlier this year, faced up to
five years behind bars under terms of a plea agreement. He was
arrested in October when he showed up for a meeting with the
13-year-old girl at the Altadena Public Library.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents said Raz obtained the girl's e-mail address while
teaching a religion class at the temple. His contract was not renewed
when it expired in June.</LD>

<HD>Listen Up: Audio Books Ease Long Commute</HD>
<DH>Motorists on their mind-numbing drives to work are key
customers for burgeoning industry --and nowhere more so than in the
Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most entrepreneurs who are locating a new business site check for
adequate parking, freeway access and real estate costs. Tyrone
Pereira looks at average commute times. The longer, the better.</LD>
<LD>   He won't even consider a neighborhood for one of his stores unless
the average driver faces a commute of 25 minutes or longer. If the
average drive time stretches for an hour or more, that's prime real
estate.</LD>
<LD>   Pereira is the co-founder of Talking Book World, the largest
retail distributor of books on cassettes and CDs. Commuters are his
core customers. The ones with long, mind-numbing drives to work are
his dream clientele.</LD>
<TE>   "The success of the product is definitely tied to the commute
time," said Pereira, whose company has 14 locations in Southern
California, with stores set to open in Temecula and Irvine this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   For the audio book industry, Southern California--home to the
nation's worst traffic congestion--is the land of milk and money.
Audio books are a $2-billion industry, and Southern California's
daily freeway snarls can take credit for a big chunk of that.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider it a major market anywhere there is a long commute,"
said Jean George, a spokeswoman for Santa Ana-based Books on Tape,
one of the pioneers of audio books.</TE>
<TE>   Southland commuters spend the equivalent of about 10 days each
year sitting in traffic, almost the same amount they spend annually
on vacation. That kind of punishment can make for drivers starved for
relief from the daily monotony of a freeway commute.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers such as Beverley Kruskol of Tarzana. She owns a commercial
painting business and must drive throughout the region to meet with
clients and workers. That means regular run-ins with the Ventura
Freeway, the "four-level" interchange downtown and those obnoxious
SigAlerts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go crazy if it wasn't for my tapes," Kruskol said as she
scanned a stack of cassettes in the Talking Book World store in
Tarzana. She mostly prefers science fiction, but also likes
mysteries. "I don't love the traffic, but at least the tapes make it
60% better," she said.</TE>
<TE>   'I Don't Even Know Who Else Is Out There'</TE>
<TE>   For many Southern California drivers, audio books are standard
survival gear--like snow tires in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Weinstein, a clothing manufacturer from Thousand Oaks, spends
a good chunk of his day in traffic, driving from one vendor to
another. But he doesn't mind, as long as he has a good book playing
in his car tape player. He prefers an engrossing mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know who else is out there," he said of his daily
commute. "I just sit back and relax."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein estimates that he has gone through 40 or 50 books in the
last year. That's a lot of time spent staring at someone else's back
bumper. It's enough to drive the most mild motorists to strangle
their own steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   But Kim Traxler, a nurse from Canoga Park, said her audio books
act as an all-natural commuting sedative. "I find that if I'm stuck
in traffic, I take out the audio book and I say, 'I'll get there when
I get there,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   The only side effect is that audio books can be addictive. Traxler
and others said they find it hard to pull themselves away from a good
book even after they have reached their destination.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be sitting in my car in my garage waiting to finish a
chapter," Kruskol said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales Up About 12%, Observers Say</TE>
<TE>   Regular customers such as Kruskol have helped boost audio book
sales nationwide about 12% in the last year, according to industry
observers.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California traffic not only fuels audio book sales, but
was a primary catalyst for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1970s, Duvall Hecht was just another frustrated
commuter, schlepping two hours each day between his home in Newport
Beach and his job at an investment firm in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   To break the monotony of the drive, Hecht ordered books on
cassette from a dealer on the East Coast. But the dealer sold only
copies of a very limited selection at a high price.</TE>
<TE>   "I went around in frustration over this," Hecht said.</TE>
<TE>   That frustration was the mother of invention because Hecht
eventually launched a business dedicated to recording thousands of
books and renting out the audio to commuters.</TE>
<TE>   With an investment of $4,000 from a friend and only four
titles--"Oil and Water," "The Paper Lion," "Happy Days" and
"Zelda"--Hecht founded Books on Tape. Last year, his firm, which
serves an average of 100,000 customers annually, was sold to Random
House for an undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it [demand for audio books] because I was on the 5 Freeway,
plodding to work every day," Hecht said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, audio book customers spend an average of 4.4 hours each
week listening in the car, according to a survey by the Audio
Publishers Assn. The selection is vast. Almost every conceivable
topic can be found on audio books, from biographies to lessons in
quantum mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular audio books tend to be the same titles found
regularly on the New York Times best-sellers list. Authors such as
John Grisham, Nelson DeMille and Elmore Leonard are often the hottest
sellers at audio book stores.</TE>
<TE>   But given the amount of time Southern California commuters spend
behind the wheel, audio books also offer an excellent opportunity to
educate and enlighten motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hatch, a movie theater designer from Palmdale, plans to learn
Chinese during the three to five hours he spends on the road each
day, meeting clients and surveying construction sites.</TE>
<TE>   "Audio books definitely make the drive more bearable," he said,
"and they are not as distracting as yakking on the cell phone all
day."</TE>
<TE>   Holy Bible on Tape, Unabridged: 72 Hours</TE>
<TE>   Many audio books promise to make you a better person while you sit
in traffic. One claims it can get you to quit smoking in two
hours--about the time it takes to commute between Palmdale and Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   A Palos Verdes Peninsula-to-Woodland Hills-length trip will
provide enough time to enjoy "The Taming of the Shrew."</TE>
<TE>   Those with a little more time (and perhaps more frazzled nerves)
can absorb "The Path to Tranquility" by the Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, for that epic commute, there is the Holy Bible,
unabridged. On 48 cassettes. That's 72 hours of reading from the Old
and New Testaments.</TE>
<TE>   As of yet, no company has recorded a commuter's version of the
Bible with the commandment: "Thou shall not use profanity in the fast
lane."</TE>

<HD>Intersil Drops 15% After Acquisition Announced</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street turned cool Monday on Intersil Corp. stock, sending its
shares down 15% a day after the Irvine maker of chips for wireless
communication and power management said it would buy Elantec
Semiconductor Inc. for about $1.24 billion in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   Intersil's shares dropped $5.49 to $31.17, while Elantec's stock
surged to a 52-week high of $48.32 before closing at $45.77, up $4.57
a share. Both stocks trade on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Gomberg, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, said
investors may be concerned that Intersil has overpaid for Elantec, a
Milpitas, Calif., maker of chips used in flat-panel monitors,
recordable DVD and CD drives and communications equipment.</LD>
<TE>   But he said that the deal made good business sense. "There's very
little product overlap and there's an opportunity for Intersil to
introduce Elantec to the variety of customers that they've yet to
penetrate," Gomberg said.</TE>

<LD>Broadcom Corp. named George Farinsky, a former chief financial
officer of Mattel Inc., as its fifth director. The Irvine chip seller
is no longer the only Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index company with four
board members. Broadcom, the world's largest maker of cable-modem
chips had five directors until Myron Eichen died in July at age 72.
Farinsky, 67, has also served as CFO of software maker Ashton-Tate
Corp. and U.S. operations president of the Bank of British Columbia.
Since 1991 he has been a consultant, private investor and corporate
director, Broadcom said.</LD>

<TE>   Interplay Entertainment Corp., an Irvine video game publisher,
said it lost $4.9 million, or 11 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter, slightly more than its net loss of $4.8 million, or 18 cents
a share, for the same period a year ago when there were fewer shares
of stock outstanding. Revenue declined 30% to $21.5 million. The
company said it released three new titles in the most recent period,
half of what it released a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Incoming Arts Chief Sues a Major Donor</HD>
<DH>Courts: The stock fraud litigation has nothing to do with
O.C. Performing Arts Center, where both have leading roles. But some
fear that relations, fund-raising will suffer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO, ANN CONWAY and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The incoming chairman of the Orange County Performing Arts Center
finds himself in the delicate position of pursuing a stock fraud
lawsuit against one of the center's biggest benefactors: Broadcom
co-founder Henry Samueli.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed last month by Thomas Tierney and several other
high-profile Broadcom investors against Samueli and other company
leaders, has been the subject of nervous speculation by county arts
insiders. Some fear that the legal fight will dampen donations and
force arts leaders to take sides.</LD>
<LD>   Samueli has donated more than $10 million to help build the new
theater and concert hall next to the Orange County Performing Arts
Center in Costa Mesa. As a member of the center's board of directors,
Samueli is responsible for raising $50,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   Despite concerns that some arts patrons have voiced privately,
center officials said they don't believe the lawsuit will have any
effect on donations from Samueli or anyone else and predicted no
other problems when Tierney takes over as chairman of the board in
July.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm counting on people to rise above these issues and do what's
important for the community," said the center's president, Jerry
Mandel.</TE>
<TE>   Mandel said Samueli has committed to buy a $75,000 table for the
center's gala fund-raiser, which has raised more than $1 million
annually in recent years, and said he knows of no threats from anyone
to pull out their money.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney, head of the fitness and nutrition company BodyWise
International Inc., is one of 26 investors who filed suit in Orange
County Superior Court last month. They accuse Samueli, Broadcom
co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III and other top officials of the
Irvine chip maker of fraud and misrepresentation.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Broadcom inflated future sales and gross margins
when Samueli, Nicholas and others sold nearly $80 million in stock
options before Broadcom's trading price tanked last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The suit isn't the first against Broadcom, whose accounting
practices first came to light last year. Other investors filed a
similar lawsuit in federal court, which was dismissed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A Broadcom lawyer said Tierney's suit is a replica of the one
dismissed Monday and predicted it would have a similar outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We view this case as an attempt to blame those ordinary market
losses on this accounting decision when ... it had no material
effect," said lawyer Dan Tyukody.</TE>
<TE>   Samueli and a company spokesman did not return calls seeking
comment Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company called the federal lawsuit "frivolous" and
denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The latest lawsuit comes as the arts center is trying to raise
$200 million for an expansion that will include a 2,000-seat symphony
hall and a 500-seat theater. Fund-raising began in July 1999 for the
symphony hall, which is slated to open in October 2005. The project
is the first major expansion of the center since it opened in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The list of lawsuit plaintiffs contains several well-known
names--most from Orange County, with others from Los Angeles and
North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Many are prominent in the overlapping worlds of business,
philanthropy and politics. Many plaintiffs also made generous
donations to the center. Several of those suing Broadcom are members
of Republicans for a New Majority, a group of moderate Republicans
that formed in 1999 to broaden participation in the party.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs include Raj and Martha Bhathal of Tustin, whose Raj
Manufacturing produces Guess licensed swimwear; Benjamin Du of
Newport Beach, president of pump manufacturer Flojet Corp., and his
wife, Carmela; Robert J. Follman, president and CEO of RA Industries
Inc., and his wife, Carole, of Coto de Caza; Thomas E. Tucker,
president of Genstar Capitol, of Newport Beach; and attorney George
J. Wall of Newport Beach and his wife, Nancy.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Higby, chief executive of Apria Healthcare Group Inc. in
Lake Forest, said his name was mistakenly added to the list of
plaintiffs. He said he called lawyers to have his name removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, my holdings were very small," he said Monday. "If I were
to start suing all the tech companies for stock losses I've suffered,
Broadcom wouldn't be at the top of the list."</TE>
<TE>   During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Broadcom wowed Wall Street
as the industry's fastest-growing chip maker. Its voracious appetite
for strategic acquisitions, buying a dozen companies in 2000 alone,
fueled its explosive growth.</TE>
<TE>   But the Irvine company was criticized early last year after
details surfaced in the press that its quick leap to $1 billion in
sales may have come in part from some accounting methods involving
five of the companies it bought.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom had arranged for those five companies to issue their
customers special "warrants"--promises to sell them Broadcom stock at
a discount--as encouragement for the customers to continue buying
products.</TE>
<TE>   News of the accounting method, and several lawsuits that followed,
came as the industry was collapsing. Broadcom's stock eventually fell
to a low of $18.77 a share, a deep drop from the $200-and-above range
of the stock at its peak. It has partly rebounded, closing Monday at
$43.95 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Tyukody, Broadcom's attorney, said the company accounted for the
warrants in a manner suggested by its accountants at Ernst &amp; Young.
It restated its third-quarter 2000 earnings and stopped using the
accounting method for the warrants.</TE>

<LD>Aris Gaddvang returned to work Monday at a 99 Cents Only store to
expressions of concern from customers and co-workers over the alleged
hate-crime attack two days earlier that left him bruised and afraid.</LD>
<LD>   Three teenagers confronted the 25-year-old store manager in the
rear parking lot of the Huntington Beach store as he prepared to
unload merchandise. They shouted racial slurs and "white power"
before beating him with metal pipes, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack reverberated across Huntington Beach on Monday--a city
that has tried to shed its reputation for hate crimes. Mayor Debbie
Cook expressed outrage at the incident and called on schools to do
more to educate young people about racial tolerance.</LD>
<TE>   "What kind of commentary is that on our society that we have
14-year-olds acting like white supremacists?" asked Huntington Beach
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg. "They learned that from somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   At the store, customers told Gaddvang they were saddened by what
happened to him and apologized on behalf of the community. But
Gaddvang, a Filipino American, has asked for a transfer out of
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited to come here because it is a big, beautiful store
in a nice neighborhood," he said. "But now I have to think of my
safety."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was particularly frightened by a call he received
Saturday evening, a few hours after the attack, from a person
Gaddvang said identified himself as a parent of one of his attackers.
Gaddvang said the caller used racial slurs and threatened him.</TE>
<TE>   Gaddvang was in the parking lot off Springdale Street around 2:30
p.m. Saturday when the three boys on skateboards taunted him with
racial slurs, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to keep my calm and told them, 'You guys don't know what
you're talking about,'" Gaddvang said. But the boys, with metal pipes
tucked in their waistbands, refused to leave, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One teen threw a pipe at Gaddvang, and when he ducked he was
attacked from behind, he said. Finally, Gaddvang said, he broke away,
after the boys allegedly threatened to return and kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested three boys several blocks away. They were taken to
Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of felony assault with a
deadly weapon, criminal threats and interfering with an individual's
civil rights. No charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked that kids are doing this," Gaddvang said as he
pointed to bruises on his arm, neck and face. "They could have killed
me. It's even more frightening if someone is teaching them this."</TE>
<TE>   Gaddvang moved to Orange County from the Philippines six years ago
and has worked for the discount store chain ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was the first time he was a target of racial hatred, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach has been the site of several high-profile hate
crimes. In the mid-1990s, the city received much media attention when
skinhead youths shouted racial slurs at an American Indian before
stabbing him 27 times.</TE>
<TE>   City officials responded by creating a task force of police,
educators and clergy. They later beefed up racial tolerance
education.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations
Commission, said the efforts have been successful: Hate crimes both
in Huntington Beach and countywide have declined for several years.
There were 122 hate crimes reported in the entire county last year,
and nine in Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole campaign against hate was a national model of what a
city can do to really turn around the image," Kennedy said. "Every
community faces this in different ways, but that's a city that did it
right."</TE>
<TE>   That makes Saturday's attack all the more vexing to city leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking about how pleasant it was we weren't referred to
as the 'white supremacist gathering place' for some time," Lowenberg
said. "I don't think we are back to that point, but we're reminded of
the days of when we were."</TE>

<TE>   Huntington Has Seen a Decline in Hate Crimes</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach has been the site of several high-profile hate

<TE>   In the mid-1990s, the city received much media attention when
skinhead youths shouted racial slurs at an American Indian before
stabbing him 27 times. The victim recovered from his wounds; a La

the evils of racism, but must help students learn to coexist with
people of different races and backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I sometimes wonder what's going on," the mayor said. "Is it
problems that are inherent in the schools that need to be addressed?
Are they getting it from their home environment?"</TE>

all the buzz isn't about "Mr. Deeds," due out in June. Rather, it's
Ryder's misdeeds, allegedly caught Dec. 12 by security cameras at a
Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store, that have been the talk of
Hollywood for months.</LD>
<LD>   But the store surveillance tape, a copy of which was viewed Monday
by The Times, doesn't live up to the hype. For 90 minutes,
closed-circuit cameras follow Ryder from Saks' first floor to the
third. She tries on several hats, then takes the escalator up to the
designer clothing sections, moving from racks of Calvin Klein slip
dresses to Donna Karan, Chanel and Yves St. Laurent on what appears
to be a major shopping spree.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have said the tape is damning evidence of a
shoplifter, interrupted. Ryder's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he has
found nothing incriminating on the tape.</LD>
<TE>   "Contrary to the public perception, this tape exonerates her,"
Geragos said. "I'd say this is a prosecution, interrupted."</TE>
<TE>   What becomes clear after viewing the tape is that many of the
allegations are based on what store security officers saw and not
what was captured on tape.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, Ryder, 30, was charged with multiple felonies--grand
theft, burglary, vandalism and possession of Oxycodone, a powerful
prescription pain reliever. At the time, the district attorney's
office issued a news release quoting Beverly Hills police saying that
Ryder had been seen on the store's closed-circuit camera using
scissors to clip off the antitheft devices, and stuffing the items
into a shopping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Some entertainment press reports have even indicated that the
actress was so intent on removing the antitheft tags from $4,760
worth of pilfered merchandise that she cut herself and left
bloodstains in a dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   But the tape shows nothing of the sort.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons backed away Monday
from her original Feb. 1 news release, which stated that Ryder had
been caught on camera using scissors to cut antitheft tags from
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons added that police reports she has seen never indicate that
Ryder cut herself. Ryder did, however, allegedly damage some
merchandise, which led to the vandalism charge, Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   While under surveillance by a female loss-prevention officer,
Ryder allegedly used scissors twice to snip antitheft tags from
several items while inside two dressing rooms, according to a law
enforcement source. But the best view offered on tape is a closed
dressing room curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what you've seen and whether you've seen the entire
tape," Gibbons said. "I haven't seen the tape, and if there was any
error in my press release, you'll have to talk to the Beverly Hills
police."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the camera might have ''seen'' didn't end up on the tape.
There is, however, plenty of footage of Ryder shopping, schlepping
and losing her grip on the bags, which fall to the floor as sales
staffers walk by. But the scissors never appear, there's no blood and
the rest seems open to interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder wears a long, dark skirt, square-toed boots and a long white
coat. She struggles at times, carrying a garment bag, a red Saks bag,
a plastic shopping bag and at least three other totes. At one point,
she stuffs several pairs of socks into a white hat.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Ryder plunks a black hat on her head and seems to forget
about it as she rides an escalator to the second floor. The price tag
is clearly visible when she enters a dressing room shortly before
4:30 p.m. When she comes out about 15 minutes later, the tag no
longer shows.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, the hat disappears when Ryder peeks out from behind
the curtain of a second dressing room. The tape offers no clue as to
where it went, although Ryder is accused of shoplifting two black
hats with a combined value of $575. She is also accused of stealing
seven pairs of socks, an Yves St. Laurent blouse, several expensive
handbags, a pricey hair band and three hairpieces.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Ryder engages in conversation with a helpful sales
clerk, who bustles in and out of the dressing room, finally returning
with a credit card receipt. As they walk toward the escalator, the
clerk rests her hand on Ryder's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, another helpful clerk brought Ryder a soft drink, and
even removed a sales tag from a small item inside one of the bags
Ryder toted. The only thing Ryder can be seen stuffing into her bag
is the paper wrapper from a straw.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder is free on $20,000 bail as the public awaits the screening
of the tape at her preliminary hearing, scheduled for Thursday. The
stakes are high for a district attorney's office that in the past has
been accused of going easy on celebrities, and for a two-time Oscar
nominee who had no film projects on her plate at the time of her
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   And so, the spinning has entered a new phase.</TE>
<TE>   Call it Saks, lies and videotape.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the Beverly Hills courthouse Monday, Geragos told
reporters that there's nothing on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are you going to believe?" he said. "The witnesses or your
own eyes? Obviously, all of this supposed smoking gun evidence
doesn't appear to be there."</TE>
<TE>   "Would Mark Geragos spin? Oh, my goodness," Gibbons said in mock
amazement.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills Saks store had no comment and referred calls to
the corporate office in New York. A spokeswoman there was out of the
office until later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   The tape seems to prove one thing: In shopping, as in other
pursuits, the famous are different from everyone else. Ryder is never
seen in line at a cash register, even though she used her Visa card
to charge thousands of dollars worth of merchandise before she was
stopped outside the store and accused of shoplifting.</TE>

<HD>A Child's Death Raises Questions About Faith</HD>
<DH>Courts: A couple who prayed instead of seeking medical care
for their daughter face charges of involuntary manslaughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although 11-month-old Julia Wiebe struggled for days with a raging
fever before dying of meningitis last summer, authorities say the
true cause of death was neglect by her mother and father.</LD>
<LD>   Richard and Agnes Wiebe of Rancho Cucamonga face charges of
involuntary manslaughter for failing to get the simple antibiotics
that would have saved Julia's life. They have pleaded not guilty.</LD>
<LD>   The Wiebes--members of a small, tightknit church in Upland whose
members claim branches around the world--say they did not realize how
sick their daughter was. But they acknowledge religious convictions
prevented them from seeking medical attention. Instead, they relied
on prayer.</LD>
<TE>   "The parents made a decision not to seek medical care, which could
have treated the child and prevented the death," pathologist Stephen
Trenkle testified during a preliminary hearing that began last month
and continues today. "They chose another form of healing. They made
that choice--and from my position, they made the wrong choice."</TE>
<TE>   The case bears striking parallels to another unfolding in Boston,
where authorities put a woman suspected of religiously motivated
medical neglect in custody to protect her unborn fetus.</TE>
<TE>   In the Wiebe case, county child welfare officials took custody of
another baby born to the couple after the death of Julia.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of their church, the Church of God Restoration,
have silently supported the couple. At one recent hearing, about a
dozen women in ankle-length skirts and long-sleeved shirts under
waist-length vests and jackets appeared in court.</TE>
<TE>   And watching everything from his seat in the back of the courtroom
was Daniel Layne, the white-bearded founder of the Restoration
Church.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the church say that under Layne's direction, members
have moved away from their families, shunned friends, and avoided
medical care for themselves and their children.</TE>
<TE>   But Layne, 58, sharply denies these charges. Church members are
free to act as they choose and are not punished, he said. Critics, he
said, are either relatives who never took the time to understand the
church or former members bearing grudges.</TE>
<TE>   "Our members are not brainwashed, they are not zombies, they are
not under any mind control," Layne said in an interview this week.
"This is a voluntary association of freethinking people."</TE>
<TE>   Although Layne declined to discuss the Wiebe case, he did say a
strong belief in divine healing is one of the tenets of the church.
He, in fact, would decline modern medical help if he were ill, Layne
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if someone here were sick and wanted to go to a hospital,"
Layne said, "I would take them to the hospital myself, stay with
them, pray with them, and then welcome them back with open arms into
our service."</TE>
<TE>   Church Rejects Much of Modern Society</TE>
<TE>   Layne, a self-described transient and recovering heroin addict
from Los Angeles, said he found God 22 years ago. He belonged briefly
to the Church of God, but quickly became frustrated with what he
considered a lax interpretation of the Bible. So in 1981 he broke
away and started his own conservative church, now located in Upland.</TE>
<TE>   Members reject much that is integral to modern society: rock
music, movies and television. The church subscribes to strict
standards of dress and behavior that includes modest dress, much like
the Amish, and favors use of prayer over medicine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go back to the year of the reform, around 1880, and
stick to what our pioneer brethren taught," Layne said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Layne's church in Upland--which now has about 55
members, he says--sprouted satellite congregations in Louisiana,
Ohio, Canada, Mexico and Germany, with a total membership that
investigators estimate at more than 800 people.</TE>
<TE>   Layne maintains that members are not forced to follow the church's
teachings, but follow out of their own free will. But some former
church members and an expert who has been tracking the group say
Layne's grip on his followers has become increasingly intense in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   One former Church of God Restoration minister said Layne attracted
him and his wife about 10 years ago with his "seriousness about
Christianity." At the time, "We didn't see the control he has now,"
said David Kauenhowen, a Canadian resident. "He was a humble man back
then. And we enjoyed the church, until he got so personally involved
in people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   After a few years, however, Layne began dictating the way
parishioners should dress, Kauenhowen said. Long pants and shirts for
men, T-shirts always underneath. Women couldn't show their legs or
even their ankles. Jewelry of any kind, including wedding rings, was
forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Layne required parishioners to seek his approval to date,
to marry or to move, Kauenhowen said. Children were subject to strict
discipline and physical punishment from an early age and were to be
home-schooled or sent to small schools run by the church. And if
relatives became critical of the new guidelines, Layne advised
shutting them out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And although prayer was always emphasized over medical treatment,
in recent years Layne began shunning members who sought help from a
doctor, calling it a sign of weakness in their faith, Kauenhowen and
others said.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Ross, a New Jersey-based consultant and paid expert witness
who writes and lectures nationally on small sects, said that in the
last six months he's gotten more than a dozen calls from former
church members or relatives alarmed by Layne's teachings. Some are
concerned that relatives are not getting proper medical care. Others
say loved ones have cut them off because they questioned the group's
beliefs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They see a situation [in which] the person they care about has a
lessening control over their lives," Ross said. "And they are fearful
of what that's leading to."</TE>
<TE>   Another Case of Trouble With the Law</TE>
<TE>   The Wiebe case is not the first time that Restoration followers
have gotten into trouble with the law.</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, Canadian authorities removed seven children from the
home of a Church of God Restoration family in Aylmer, Ontario.
Authorities were responding to complaints that the children had been
beaten, in some cases with belts and sticks, and that at least one
child suffered a severe burn and was denied medical care. The
children were returned to their parents by the court with conditions
for their treatment while a trial is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Kauenhowen, the former minister, said he told Layne he was alarmed
by the direction of the church, a criticism that got him thrown out
in February 2000, he said. Current members, he added, no longer speak
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Layne, who has never been married and has no children, said
Kauenhowen is simply bitter over his falling out with the church. And
relatives who complain are doing so because they refuse to understand
their loved one's faith. Some interpret the church as extreme because
of its rejection of all that modern society has to offer. But that
does not make it a cult, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pressure from society to conform to the norm," Layne
said. "And that's difficult for us because we have a doctrine that
teaches separation from what society teaches us--immorality, rock
music, divorce, sexually explicit material, television. To us, all of
that is horrible."</TE>
<TE>   He denies being the church's only leader. Five other elder
ministers join him in overseeing its teachings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't deny I have an influence on the church," Layne said.
"But I would deny that anyone has to accept [my influence]....We
don't run people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Courts Draw the Line at Hurting Children</TE>
<TE>   Ross said there are thousands of small sects across the country
not affiliated with Restoration that follow similar beliefs regarding
medical treatment. And though the courts try to respect the
fundamental right to religious freedom for adults, they draw the line
when edicts of the church hurt children.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors routinely charge parents with offenses ranging from
child neglect to manslaughter for denying medical care.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the boldest moves yet by a court, a Massachusetts judge
ordered Rebecca Corneau into protective custody to ensure the safety
of her unborn fetus. Corneau belonged to a fundamentalist sect called
The Body, which rejects all medicine, including prenatal care.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, the Wiebes' 11-month-old daughter began vomiting. Over
the next few days, she became sicker, eventually developing a fever
and suffering seizures that lasted more than two hours at a time,
Richard Wiebe told investigators. Wiebe and his wife fervently prayed
over the little girl. They covered her tiny body with wet rags. As
she weakened, they fed their daughter chamomile tea through an
eyedropper. The Wiebes said they didn't know how sick their daughter
was. They thought she just had the flu.</TE>
<TE>   But by July 6, the little girl stopped breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The Wiebes tried to perform CPR, but Julia never recovered. Wiebe
called their pastor, Layne, who directed the couple to call
paramedics, according to court testimony. Investigators believe the
baby had been dead more than two hours by the time they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by San Bernardino County Sheriff's
investigators, Richard Wiebe, a draftsman for an Upland company, said
he and his wife never considered taking Julia to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "That was not something that I had an option for," Wiebe told
investigators during a taped interview played in court Thursday. "I'm
settled with the Lord and I was going to trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Wiebe added he still believes he made the right decision. He was
prepared to accept God's will.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith is not a guarantee that we will be healed," Wiebe told
investigators. "Faith is just believing that God's way will be done."</TE>
<TE>   Agnes Wiebe was pregnant at the time of Julia's death and has
since given birth to a boy. Sheriff's officials seized the baby in
January and placed him in protective custody. A trial in that case is
also pending.</TE>
<TE>   The Wiebes remain free on bail. The judge in Rancho Cucamonga
Superior Court will decide whether to order them to stand trial.</TE>

<HD>Dog Could Not Be Stopped, Owner Says</HD>
<DH>Trial: Defendant Marjorie Knoller describes her futile
efforts to pull her pet off its victim. 'It got worse and worse and
worse.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sobbing San Francisco lawyer testified Monday that she could not
stop her large Presa Canario dog from fatally mauling her neighbor,
despite yelling at the dog, jerking his leash and even throwing her
body on top of the victim to try to save her.</LD>
<LD>   "He just wouldn't stop what he was doing," said Marjorie Knoller,
who is on trial for murder in last year's death of Diane Whipple.
"Anything I was trying he wasn't listening.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time I would think it would be over and I could get him
away from her and get him the hell out of there, it would get worse
and it would start all over. It got worse and worse and worse."</LD>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, wearing a periwinkle blazer and with her hair pulled
back in a ponytail, spoke clearly and strongly, but broke down in
tears several times.</TE>
<TE>   Her defense attorney, Nedra Ruiz, questioned her for nearly five
hours. Prosecutors will cross-examine her today. Whipple's partner of
seven years, Sharon Smith, watched Knoller's testimony from the front
row.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, died Jan. 26, 2001, after
being attacked by two dogs as she returned to her San Francisco
apartment from getting groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, who was indicted on charges of second-degree murder,
involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog, faces 15
years to life in prison. Her husband, Robert Noel, was charged with
the two lesser counts and faces a sentence of four years.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, Bane and Hera, have since been destroyed. The trial was
moved to Los Angeles because of publicity in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have argued that their clients were responsible
dog owners and that the attack was unexpected. Prosecutors maintain
that Knoller and Noel knew their dogs--each weighing more than 100
pounds--were dangerous and did nothing to prevent the mauling.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said that on the afternoon of Jan. 26, she had taken Bane
for a walk on the roof and was about to enter her apartment when the
dog noticed Whipple at the end of the hallway. Bane started pulling
Knoller down the hallway toward Whipple, she said, despite her
yanking on his leash with all her strength and sternly saying, "Bane,
come."</TE>
<TE>   Bane pulled Knoller off her feet and dragged her face down on the
floor down the sixth-floor hallway, she testified, until he reached
Whipple and jumped up on her and started tearing at her clothing. "I
had never seen him do any of that before," she said. Hera was nearby,
barking hysterically, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The dog would calm down momentarily, but then would react
violently any time Whipple tried to move, Knoller said. She said she
got on and off Whipple a few times as she attempted to shield her
from the attack.</TE>
<TE>   At one point when Knoller was on top of Whipple and telling her,
"Stay down, don't move," Whipple threw her arm back and hit Knoller
in the face, she testified. It was then that Bane bit Whipple in the
neck.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by Ruiz why she didn't call 911, Knoller said she was busy
trying to get Bane away from Whipple. "I'm not going to leave and
leave Ms. Whipple out there with no one there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said she also was bitten by Bane during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had presented witnesses who testified that the
attorneys were associates of a prison gang and helped run an
attack-dog breeding ring.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by Ruiz if she was part of the Aryan Brotherhood gang,
Knoller said, "I'm Jewish," adding that her relatives were "survivors
of the Holocaust, so no."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller told jurors she felt sorry for Whipple and her loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Just thinking about the horrible way that Ms. Whipple died in
that hallway causes me great, great sorrow, and I'm in pain for
everybody who knew her and spent time with her," she said. "My heart
goes to her family and friends that she died such a horrible,
horrible death."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz presented her client as a hard-working, compassionate
attorney who did legal work for the mentally ill, homeless and AIDS
patients. Knoller also described her lifelong love of animals,
including horses and big dogs such as English mastiffs and Akitas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in all kinds of dogs, especially large dogs,"
Knoller told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said she and Noel subscribed to magazines such as Dog
World and Dog Fancy and downloaded information from the Internet
about Presa Canario dogs. She said she was drawn to Presa Canarios
because they were guard dogs, but had a reputation for being
sensitive and gentle. Knoller said she kept in mind the history of
Presa Canarios as fighting dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "They were protective, they were loyal to their owners, somewhat
wary of strangers," she testified. "You have to be aware of the fact
that they may be dog aggressive, but that generally doesn't translate
over to people."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said she and her husband frequently walked the dogs to
parks and through busy neighborhoods in San Francisco. Knoller said
she trained them to respond to basic commands but never trained them
to be aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged, however, that Bane was not entirely passive. In
September 2000. She said Bane severely bit Noel's finger as he was
trying to break up a fight between Bane and another dog at a beach.</TE>
<TE>   The bite required surgery and four days of hospitalization, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Assistant Dist. Atty. James Hammer said he
plans to ask Knoller about statements she made to a San Francisco
grand jury and about previous testimony from other witnesses who
described the dogs as frightening.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said the jury will have to decide what Knoller was crying
about.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if she was crying for Hera, herself or Diane," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Charter School in Flap Over Attendance</HD>
<DH>Education: Palisades High's absence policy is opposed by
parents, officials. Forty teachers face discipline unless they
reverse grades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teachers at Pacific Palisades Charter High School last fall thought
they were on solid ground when they enforced a tough attendance
policy that gave failing grades to students who had too many
unexcused absences.</LD>
<LD>   Now 40 teachers themselves face possible disciplinary action this
week if they ignore orders from their principal and Los Angeles
Unified School District officials to pass as many as 200 students who
flunked classes in February under the attendance policy. District
officials say that the attendance policy was never properly vetted
and that it is probably illegal.</LD>
<LD>   Those teachers now complain that school administrators caved in to
angry parents and let absentee students off the hook.</LD>
<TE>   The row shows the difficult balance many schools are trying to
achieve between parental involvement and meddling as they implement
tough educational standards.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff also highlights the sometimes testy relationship
between L.A. Unified and its semi-independent charter schools. Pali
High is a 2,500-student charter school including a math and science
magnet that draws students from all over the city. It remains part of
the district, but some teachers say the school may apply this year to
become fully independent under a state program.</TE>
<TE>   The attendance policy flap will be aired today at a school
governance council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Last week 70 teachers signed a letter urging Pali's principal to
defend the attendance rules, which flunk students who have more than
six unexcused absences in a semester. The policy allows parents to
appeal after the fact with doctors' notes and other legitimate
excuses.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers say that the policy is a matter of principle and that
it's important to teach students the value of responsibility. All the
tests and education reforms in the world, they add, won't make a bit
of difference if students don't show up.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Ford failed his cooking class because of absences and
tardies but received an A after the teacher in that class responded
to the principal's directive. Ford still has a failing grade in
English, which he missed seven times during the fall semester.</TE>
<TE>   "He's allergic to many different things," said Ford's mother,
Jacqueline Watson, who is appealing the English grade. "He has
migraines. I even brought in a letter from the doctor's office" to
cover several missed classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should he get a failing grade if he made up all the work?"
she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Redclay, a Pali English teacher and faculty senate
chairwoman, vows the faculty will go to court before letting truant
students pass. "We'll hire a lawyer, even if we have to do bake
sales," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Mills, a Spanish teacher who has a daughter attending Pali,
said changing the grades "would send a message that we are going to
graduate you and send you out into the world without teaching you to
be accountable for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   But the local cluster administrator, Carol Dodd, said that the
attendance policy was never an approved part of Pali's charter. As a
charter school within the district, Pali can apply to waive certain
requirements but has much less autonomy than charter schools that
have seceded.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no record on file of an attendance policy from the
school," said Dodd, "so Palisades must abide by district guidelines
and district policy." Under district policy, students who hand in
their work and make up tests should pass regardless of attendance.
Dodd directed Pali Principal Linda Hosford to discipline teachers who
refuse to change grades, but she declined to say what those
disciplinary actions might entail.</TE>
<TE>   Hosford was also reluctant to detail those measures but said they
could include submitting negative evaluations into teachers'
personnel files. Hosford originally defended the attendance policy,
which the school began implementing in 1994 and still posts on its
Web site. She credited the rule with increasing the school's
attendance rate from around 85% to its current level of 92%.</TE>
<TE>   But a few days ago, Hosford was told that there was no written
policy for Pali on file at district headquarters and that she had to
enforce the district one instead.</TE>
<TE>   Pali Spanish teacher Maggie Nance accused the district of
deep-sixing the policy to appease upset parents. She and other
teachers blamed Margaret Evans, the assistant principal in charge of
attendance, for being too soft on negligent students and encouraging
parents to complain to the district about the attendance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said she enforced Pali's attendance policy until she learned
that the district hadn't approved it. But Evans said some teachers
seem overeager to fail students. One student, Evans said, missed more
than six days because she had traveled to Argentina and got stuck
there during civil unrest. That case is being appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Other students have been excused because of deaths in the family
or health problems, Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's able to keep up with his work, how are you going to fail
him?" she asked, pointing out that teachers can be absent for 10 full
days and still get their salary. "So why would you take an A from a
kid and give them a fail after six days? I mean, we are in business
of educating the kids, so why are we trying to hurt them?"</TE>
<TE>   Max Lebovitz is a 17-year-old senior who has been accepted at
several colleges, including Arizona State University and Colorado
State University. He had six absences and then three tardies to his
first period painting class. Three tardies count as an absence at
Pali.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher, who gave him an F, changed it back to an A under an
order from the principal, according to Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Vasant Kearney, 18, received Fs because he missed as many as 13
days in classes. To appeal, he later brought in notes from his
father, David Kearney, a Topanga acupuncturist and doctor of Oriental
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "Vasant has respiratory seasonal sicknesses and also physically
injured himself a couple times [practicing karate]," said Kearney in
a phone interview. "I've been in practice for 30 years--it would be
ludicrous to get a note from another doctor."</TE>

<HD>Ruling on Grand Jury Gets Charges Dropped</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Judge says for the second time this year
that the panel does not represent a fair cross-section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Monday threw out the indictment against a handyman accused of
rape and murder, ruling for the second time this year that the
Ventura County Grand Jury is male-dominated and does not reflect a
cross-section of the county's population.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling sets aside the indictment against Vincent Sanchez, who
is accused of gunning down a 20-year-old Moorpark College student
last summer during a rape attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The much-anticipated decision comes more than a month after the
same judge, Frank Ochoa in Santa Barbara County Superior Court,
issued a nearly identical ruling in a separate death penalty murder
case. That decision is being appealed.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez, a 30-year-old from Simi Valley, has pleaded not guilty to
first-degree murder in the July 5 slaying of Megan Barroso, as well
as attempted rape and assault charges involving four other women. All
of those criminal counts were dismissed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   However, the court ruling does not affect guilty pleas Sanchez
entered in the rapes and assaults of 10 other women during the last
five years.</TE>
<TE>   In his 39-page decision, Ochoa ruled that the September 2001
indictment was unlawful because the procedures used to seat the
Ventura County Grand Jury are defective.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, court administrators solicit volunteers to serve on the
19-member panel. Ochoa found the selection process does not draw a
fair cross-section of the community as required by state and federal
law, and has resulted in male-dominated grand juries for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he found that women constituted only 30% of the
2001-02 grand jury pool. Of 40 applicants, only 12 were women.</TE>
<TE>   "The disparate representation of women in Ventura's grand jury
pool was consistent throughout a five-year period," Ochoa wrote.
"From 1995 to 2000, there were a total of 333 grand jury pool members
in Ventura. Only 99 of 333 were women."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ochoa found there was no intentional discrimination, he
ruled the selection process flawed nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said her
office has not decided whether to appeal the dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to read it and digest it and decide what to do," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling sends the Sanchez case back to the arraignment stage
and could force prosecutors to present their evidence at a
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Sanchez terrorized Simi Valley residents
from 1996 to 2001 with a series of rapes before kidnapping and
murdering Barroso. They contend he shot at her car as she drove home
from a Fourth of July party and then dragged her from the car. At
some point, they say, he tried to rape her.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn argues that there is no
evidence to show his client killed Barroso during a rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is significant: Paired with a first-degree murder
charge, the rape allegation makes Sanchez eligible for the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials said they are now looking at ways to revise the
grand jury system in Ventura County.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Lawmakers Facing Term Limits</HD>
<DH>Politics: San Francisco native sons Willie Brown and John
Burton may decide to switch jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Le Central bistro is a hip downtown hangout where hizzoner Mayor
Willie Brown regularly holds court, springing for martinis and
rolling dice with a few cronies to decide who pays for their repast
of roasted chicken and petrale sole.</LD>
<LD>   But in this bastion of high-profile lawyers and businesspeople,
the diners are not shy about assessing their politicians. Some see
Brown and state Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), his
friend and ally, as two veteran lawmakers who may be seeing the end
of their political shelf lives, like aging wedges of sharp cheese.</LD>
<LD>   "Just once, I'd like to see these people get real jobs," said cafe
regular Leslie Knapp. "All their lives, they've known nothing but
politics. It's time to move on."</LD>
<TE>   Nowadays, the two larger-than-life native sons face looming
decisions about their political futures: Now that Californians have
rejected a proposition to loosen term limits, many believe that
Democrats Brown and Burton could soon play a game of political
musical chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who started life as a poor kid from Texas, established
himself as a political titan by serving 31 years in the California
Assembly, the last 14 as speaker. He was elected San Francisco mayor
in a 1995 landslide, and won a second and final term--though not as
easily--in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, a recovered drug addict whose brother was the legendary
Rep. Phil Burton, served in the state Assembly and in Congress. In
1998, he took the helm of the state Senate, becoming the most
powerful politician in California after Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The 67-year-old Brown, whose term ends next year, has already
raised a $1-million campaign war chest and has set his sights on
Burton's seat, which opens up in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   And while Burton at the moment says he does not want to become San
Francisco's next mayor, the election is still more than a year off
and nobody is counting him out.</TE>
<TE>   San Franciscans, who have historically preferred colorful
politicians and supported long-term administrations, recently bucked
the state trend on term limits: While Proposition 45--which would
have allowed termed-out incumbents the possibility of an
extension--failed elsewhere, 53% of the city's voters backed the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Brown Says He Has Many Good Years Left</TE>
<TE>   For many, Brown remains a star with plenty of shining power.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget about voters and term limits--those mandates are the
tyranny of the majority," said Doug MacPhereson, perched at a window
seat at Le Central. "Willie Brown has a unique brand of leadership
which doesn't always wait for any consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, the cocksure former lawyer who once dubbed himself the
Ayatollah of the Assembly, says he has many good years of politicking
left. "I've done 40 years of politics with no wear and tear on me,"
he said. "I have more energy than people one-tenth my age. I still
have full use of my brains. There's no reason I should be put out to
pasture."</TE>
<TE>   Since election day, the 69-year-old Burton--normally accessible to
the media--has been reluctant to talk to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   He was dealt double blows last week: Not only did he lose the
term-limit fight but his daughter, Kimiko Burton, was also defeated
in her bid to keep her job as San Francisco public defender, despite
his financial and political backing.</TE>
<TE>   When reached on his cell phone Friday and asked about his future,
Burton said: "I'm gonna go eat lunch. Talk to you later." And he hung
up.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Brown and Burton should follow their instincts. "I
don't think they should hesitate for a minute," said Raymond
Wolfinger, a UC Berkeley political science professor. "For voters to
say they're in favor of the generic concept of term limits is a
different thing than giving the boot to two of their most beloved
statesmen."</TE>
<TE>   Others sense a shift--a younger grass-roots movement starting to
overtake the machine politics of old-timers like Burton and Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "The new grass-roots liberalism is a big caution to these two
men," said Ed Moose, a restaurant owner and local Democratic
organizer. "There are 200,000 people living in this city who weren't
here five years ago. People just don't vote the way they used to."</TE>
<TE>   Moose said Burton now "has baggage because he couldn't get his
daughter elected." And Brown--who often brags he has never lost an
election--has his own concerns, Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent elections, numerous Brown-backed local candidates in
county supervisor races as well as various political measures backed
by the mayor have gone down to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, Willie Brown is not the guy who always wins,"
Moose said. "He's lost more than he's won over the last year and a
half."</TE>
<TE>   But blue-collar San Franciscans still love their mayor. At Capps
Corner, a North Beach eatery frequented by cops and longshoremen,
it's all Willie, all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco needs Willie Brown like Chicago needed Richard
Daley," said police officer Dick Sheehan. "You need a powerful
politician like Willie to get things done with all this town's
battling political factions."</TE>
<TE>   Added Mike Paulsen, who sat next to Sheehan at the bar: "Willie
Brown is just getting started. Why give him the boot when he's doing
a hell of a job?"</TE>
<TE>   Mixed Opinions on Politicians' Futures</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner at Moose's restaurant, the bets on Brown's and
Burton's futures were mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Freitas, a retired San Francisco district attorney and a
Burton friend, said he thinks the senator would have run for mayor if
his daughter had won her race.</TE>
<TE>   "But now he's got to think long and hard about it," he said. "He's
almost 70. I think it would be physically difficult for him."</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby table, Jeff Adachi, who defeated Burton's daughter for
the public defender's job, said the days of old-style San Francisco
politics might be over: "But the machine has been so powerful for so
long, hand-choosing their own candidates, I'm afraid we don't have a
generation of young politicians ready to take its place."</TE>
<TE>   Though he has already met with political backers to discuss a
state Senate run, Brown said he will not begin to actively campaign
until he leaves his job as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brown called the idea of term limits "un-American."</TE>
<TE>   "The very idea of voter choice means we have the ability to vote
for the same person in perpetuity, day in and day out, if that
pleases you," he said. "To punish the veteran politician just because
he becomes experienced at his job, to not reward him, is just
anti-Democratic."</TE>
<TE>   At Le Central, diners such as Leslie Knapp say they've heard
enough from Willie Brown for now: "Yes, he's a regular here and he
gets things done and he has a lot of charisma, but it's always got to
be Willie's agenda. Who cares what the voters want?"</TE>
<TE>   She paused, as if tapped on the shoulder by hizzoner himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I've said that, Willie will never buy me another drink."</TE>

<HD>Protest Trip Ends at Taco Bell</HD>
<DH>Labor: Tomato field workers make the trip from Florida to
Irvine seeking support for better wages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS and MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cross-country caravan of Florida tomato field workers upset with
Taco Bell, a major tomato buyer, for not helping in their struggle
for better wages arrived at its destination Monday: Taco Bell
corporate headquarters in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The farm workers were greeted enthusiastically by local supporters
in a street rally outside the 12-story, glass-walled headquarters
building. Their reception by Taco Bell officials was cordial but far
less than what the visitors had hoped it would be.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, Taco Bell told them it wasn't the company's fight.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a labor dispute between the workers and their employer,
the Six L Packing Co.," said Jonathan Blum, senior vice president for
public affairs for Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., Taco Bell's parent
company. "We don't intervene in any company's labor dispute."</TE>
<TE>   The workers and church officials supporting them had a different
view.</TE>
<TE>   "Taco Bell just can't say, 'It's not our issue.' It's certainly an
issue to their customers," said the Rev. Noelle Damico of the
Washington, D.C.-based United Church of Christ's National Office for
Justice and Peace.</TE>
<TE>   Others have succeeded recently in pushing fast-food companies to
make changes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals pressured
McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's to strengthen supervision of
their suppliers to ensure better treatment of cows and chickens
before and during slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   The three burger chains deny they capitulated to PETA. But Richard
Martin, managing editor of Nation's Restaurant News, credits a PETA
boycott and ad campaign with having an effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to alienate their customers with bad publicity," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the chains now require suppliers to give
egg-laying hens a minimum of 72 square inches of living space.</TE>
<TE>   The two-bus caravan left Florida three weeks ago and stopped at
several cities where it has support groups. Monday, they were greeted
by nearly 500 supporters at Santa Ana Memorial Park. With a police
escort, the crowd walked behind a flatbed truck, singing and chanting
slogans during the two-mile trek from Santa Ana to Von Karman Avenue
in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The 65 Florida workers from the caravan led the parade. For
Hernael Alvarado, who has picked tomatoes for 10 years, it was a
special way to spend his 40th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "The work is hard, the day is long," he said, "all for 40 cents a
bucket."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarado wore a cardboard hat with the image of a tomato. The
pickers and packers are part of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers,
which organized the caravan. Lucas Benitez, an organizer, said
workers are paid 40 cents for each 30-gallon bucket. Few workers can
pick more than 150 buckets a day, which is $60.</TE>
<TE>   Florida supplies most of the nation's tomatoes during the winter.
The state's tomato industry has a crop value of about $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among those walking with the workers were members of Local Union
652, a construction laborers' union.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our members know what it's like to work for the kind of
wages these farm workers have to feed their families on," said Rudy
Ruvalcava, union spokesman. "We just want to show our support."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine police blocked off a quarter-mile stretch of the street for
the rally. At Taco Bell, 80 security guards hired for the day ringed
the headquarters grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We did that at the police's suggestion," Tricon's Blum said. "Our
primary objective was just to make sure that no one got hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The farm workers and their supporters are trying to raise public
awareness for their national boycott of Taco Bell's 7,000 fast-food
restaurants. The boycott was a factor in Taco Bell's recent decision
to meet with Six L to discuss the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We only told the packing company that because it was affecting
our company, we hoped it would do what it could to resolve the labor
issue," Blum said. "But we are not intervening."</TE>
<TE>   Blum said Taco Bell does not buy tomatoes from Six L but from a
broker, which buys from several companies, including Six L.</TE>
<TE>   Taco Bell did meet with organizers of Monday's rally, but Blum
said it was a courtesy visit because the group had come all the way
from Florida.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Seeking Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>As major league officials opened their disciplinary investigation
into Saturday's twin brawls between the Angels and San Diego Padres,
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia suggested a severe suspension would be in
order for San Diego pitcher Bobby Jones.</LD>
<LD>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said he has fulfilled a
request to provide video footage of the incidents to the office of
Bob Watson, who handles discipline for Commissioner Bud Selig. Watson
is scheduled to visit here Thursday on unrelated business.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia would not explicitly say who among the six ejected he
believed should be suspended, but he left no doubt that he hoped
officials come down hard on Jones, who triggered the second
bench-clearing brawl by throwing an inside and high fastball to the
Angels' Troy Glaus.</LD>
<TE>   "If they throw at someone's head, they should step in and suspend
the guy and make it a deterrent--not just a one-day or two-day
thing--so there are consequences," Scioscia said. "Then players
wouldn't have to take it into their own hands."</TE>
<TE>   After the Angels' Aaron Sele hit the Padres' Ryan Klesko on the
back, a plunking Klesko said Sele had previously vowed to deliver,
Klesko charged the mound, and the first fight was on. In response,
Jones threw a fastball high and tight to Glaus, who charged the
mound, and the second fight was on.</TE>
<TE>   Jones acknowledged trying to "protect my hitters" by throwing
inside to Glaus in retaliation for Sele hitting Klesko.</TE>
<TE>   "If you read the quotes, it was obvious there was intent on their
part," Scioscia said. "That's what was disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia did not care for Jones' explanation that the pitch was
intended to be inside but not that high.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk you run if you're throwing at somebody is, you're human,
you miss by a foot and you run the risk of killing somebody,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub pitcher Julian Tavarez was suspended for five
regular-season games and San Francisco Giant infielder Russ Davis for
three after a spring training brawl last year.</TE>
<TE>   If Glaus and Scott Spiezio--the two Angels ejected--are suspended,
the Angels hope the suspensions would not be enforced simultaneously,
so that Spiezio could play third base during the games Glaus could
not.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon drove in four runs, three on a home run, in a 13-6
Cactus League victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Salmon is
hitting .412 in 17 at-bats this spring, and his two home runs and 10
runs batted in already exceed his totals for last spring, which
preceded the worst season of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like night and day for me," he said. "I wanted to feel the
swing I've had in the past, and I've done that. This is a confidence
booster."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy went three for three and is hitting
.600 in 15 at-bats.... Catcher Jorge Fabregas is expected to miss
five to seven days with a badly bruised toe suffered on a foul tip.
The Angels sent him for X-rays, which revealed no broken bones....
The Angels wouldn't mind adding another left-hander to their bullpen.
They'll watch the waiver wire, but they're not excited about
available left-handers such as Pedro Borbon of Toronto and Mike
Magnante of Oakland.... The Angels sent 14 players to minor league
camp and put pitcher Steve Green, still rehabilitating from
reconstructive elbow surgery, on the disabled list.</TE>

<HD>Ailing Roddick to Sit Out Event</HD>

<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>An ailing Andy Roddick is facing a $20,000 fine from the ATP Tour for
his withdrawal from the Pacific Life Open, even though it was obvious
he was in discomfort during Sunday's final at Delray Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   To avoid the penalty, Roddick, seeded 11th here, would have to fly
to the tournament site by Wednesday to be examined by a doctor. His
agent, Ken Meyerson of SFX, said Monday that Roddick would not
appear, indicating a fine would be appealed.</LD>
<LD>   "He's definitely got an ear infection," Meyerson said. "It's
pretty bad. He'll be bedridden at least today, tomorrow and the next
day. He's clearly sick."</LD>
<TE>   Ordinarily, the fine is $10,000, but because Roddick is ranked in
the range of 11-25 and was seeded, the fine is doubled. Had he
retired in the final against Davide Sanguinetti of Italy, Roddick
would have been examined and presumably would not have been fined.</TE>
<TE>   The rule was put in place to prevent players from abusing the
system, damaging tournaments with last-minute withdrawals. Richard
Ings, the tour's executive vice president of rules and competition,
said an appeal of the fine would go through chief executive officer
Mark Miles.</TE>
<TE>   Ings said successful appeals are rare.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick was replaced in the draw by Francisco Clavet of Spain, who
lost in the first round.</TE>

<LD>Beignets, anyone?</LD>
<LD>   Or grits?</LD>
<LD>   Baron Davis is traveling light and moving fast these days,
although just where, he can't tell you.</LD>
<TE>   It could be Charlotte, where the Hornets now draw flies while the
city tries to figure out how to keep the team but lose its owners ...
or New Orleans, where the owners say they're headed, although tickets
are moving slowly and Commissioner David Stern is maintaining an
ominous silence ... or none of the above.</TE>
<TE>   Davis could be a free agent in the summer of 2003, at 24, having
just become an All-Star for the first time at 22, and will be one of
the hottest tickets in a star-studded class.</TE>
<TE>   It's been some trip too:</TE>
<TE>   * 1997-1998 season: Blows out knee as a UCLA freshman, requiring
major surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998-1999: Returns with a heavy brace but regains much of his
form. Assured of being a top pick, declares for the draft. Doesn't
want to play in Charlotte, which has the No. 3 pick, and has his
agent so inform the Hornets. They take him anyway.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999-2000: Rides the bench while the other top picks--Elton
Brand of the Chicago Bulls, Steve Francis of the Houston Rockets and
Lamar Odom of the Clippers--are tearing it up, which makes him look
like the dud of the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000-2001: Becomes starter.</TE>
<TE>   * 2001-2002: Becomes All-Star. Now averages 19 points a game and
ranks in the top 10 in assists, steals, minutes and, in a surprise,
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   "When he first came to me," says Coach Paul Silas, "you could
almost categorize him as a non-shooter. And after the first year, he
stayed after the season and worked for, like, 14 straight days on his
shot and it started to come....</TE>
<TE>   "He works perhaps harder than anybody on my team. And that was the
only thing that was missing. He had everything else--athleticism,
could handle the ball, could go to the hoop strong, knowledge of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably my smartest player. He really is, he's just
brilliant. But he's young. That's what you have to understand, he's
going to have his highs and lows because he's only 22.</TE>
<TE>   "He has all it takes to be a star in this league. If he keeps his
head and keeps progressing, I think he has star written all over
him."</TE>
<TE>   Just as they always said he did.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, at one time or another, they said lots of things about
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Malfeasance, Nonfeasance</TE>
<TE>   I spend a lot of time trying to analyze what Boston did wrong,
what the Lakers did wrong, what the Pistons did wrong. How do you
stop that major fall after a long-term championship team? ...</TE>
<TE>   Boston probably could have traded Kevin McHale or Robert Parish
four or five years ago and gotten talent to keep themselves going.
And instead of trying to dump James Worthy in the last two years of
his contract, if the Lakers had moved four years ago, they maybe
could have gotten ... but I don't know. It's not easy to do.</TE>
<TE>   If it ever came that I had to move Larry [Johnson], it'd be a
tough decision.</TE>
<TE>   --Hornet President Spencer Stolpen, January 1993</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, what was missing in the Hornets' plans to avoid a major
fall after becoming long-term champions?</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes, a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Owner George Shinn and Stolpen, his right-hand man, were out of
their gourds from the get-go. They were in their sixth season, having
made the playoffs for the first time the previous spring, when
Stolpen delivered the above exercise in exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   They were full of themselves to bursting, packing their huge,
23,000-seat arena nightly--for 10 consecutive seasons--and lucking
into one top lottery pick (No. 1 choice Johnson in 1991) after
another (No. 2 Alonzo Mourning in 1992.)</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there was a problem with Johnson's back, which
everyone thought was minor in the summer of '93, when Shinn,
valentines passing before his eyes, gave him a 10-year, $84-million
extension, though Johnson still had three seasons left on his old
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Aghast, Stern asked Shinn if he realized he'd given one player
almost three times the $32.5-million expansion fee the league had
charged him.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Hornet bosses were easy to impress or depress. Said
Stolpen of the other NBA owners, who wanted to tar and feather them:</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of them are just jealous that they didn't have an
owner and/or a player to put those two things together."</TE>
<TE>   No, sometimes things don't turn out the way you think they will.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was never the same player again. He'd be dumped
unceremoniously to the Knicks, who were desperate enough to take his
mammoth salary, three seasons later.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Hornets were in the midst of a talent drain, 27 free
agents leaving from 1996 until last summer when they finally got
one--Jamal Mashburn--to stay.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't count Mourning, who forced them to trade him for Glen
Rice ... or Rice, who forced them to trade him for Eddie Jones and
Elden Campbell ... after which Jones left as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't count Kobe Bryant, whom the Hornets drafted and
(oops) traded to the Lakers (helping them rebuild from the James
Worthy days) for Vlade Divac ... who left as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   So, when the 19-year-old Davis, who dreamed of being a Laker or,
at least, a Minnesota Timberwolf so he could play with Kevin Garnett,
told the Hornets he wouldn't play with them, he was only carrying on
a grand tradition.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't go to Charlotte to work out. The Hornets had to scout
him off videotape.</TE>
<TE>   It was good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Arn [Tellem, Davis' agent] for 1,000 years," says
Silas. "He tried to talk me out of it. I just told him, flat-out,
'Arn, we're taking him. If he wants to sit out a year and go back in
the draft, that's his choice but we're going to take him."</TE>
<TE>   Says Davis, "I thought I was going to be traded--until Paul Silas
called me and said, 'We're taking you, that's that, deal with it.'</TE>
<TE>   "I go, 'Charlotte, it is.'</TE>
<TE>   "Deep down inside, I didn't care, because it was going to be a
dream come true, regardless."</TE>
<TE>   Well, way down deep inside.</TE>
<TE>   He Had a Lot of Growing Up To Do</TE>
<TE>   When I was 5 feet 5 in 10th grade, people used to say I wouldn't
go high Division I, I would probably go somewhere like Northern
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   And I proved them wrong. They said when I hurt my knee that I'd
never be the same, I'd never make it to the NBA but I've done it....</TE>
<TE>   My rookie season they said, "Damn, B.D.'s not going to pan out ...
he's just another one of those UCLA guys who get to the league and
don't really do anything." I've proven them wrong.</TE>
<TE>   --Baron Davis</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At 6-21/2, 210, Davis doesn't look like the typical NBA player.
More like the typical NFL strong safety.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what he looked like as a 5-3 ninth-grader at Santa Monica
Crossroads High School.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1994. The local hot prospects were Schea Cotton, Chris
Burgess and the Collins twins, Jason and Jarron. Davis was a squat,
chunky little afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to run around the court and steal the ball from everybody,
like, run between their legs," he says. "It was, like, I dreamed of
playing in the NBA. I wanted to, but I was small. I just wanted to
get to college. I just wanted to play Division I basketball....</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was really getting recruited my sophomore year. I wasn't
getting recruited at all. I saw a magazine, HoopScoop, and I was like
the last guy on the last page, out of 2,000 kids in the country in my
class....</TE>
<TE>   "I was somebody nobody really heard of, but I got invited to Nike
camp.... My AAU coach, he went to them. I mean, me and him pretty
much begged them to let me in their camp."</TE>
<TE>   Davis says he could dunk at 5-5. It got easier as he grew to 6-1
his senior year. By then, they were saying he was the next coming of
Stephon Marbury.</TE>
<TE>   He thought about going to Georgia Tech, as Marbury had, briefly.
That is, Marbury was only there for one year, and Davis didn't think
about it for long. His grandmother, Lela Nicholson, "was like, 'No,
you're going to UCLA.'"</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, knee injury or no knee injury, he was an NBA
lottery pick. Of course, a year later, when he was warming the bench
in Charlotte, this didn't look like the world's greatest decision.</TE>
<TE>   Silas had a veteran point guard, David Wesley. There was also that
problem with Davis' jump shot, which didn't often go in.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the third pick, and I think I was the only one not
starting," Davis says. "Like out of the first six, me and Johnny
Bender [of Indiana].</TE>
<TE>   "It was just, like, devastating really. I was miserable my whole
rookie year.... It was my first time being away from home. I was
homesick. I wasn't playing, and I wasn't playing like I knew how to
play. When I'd get in, I'd be in for, like, five or six minutes and
come right out. It was hard."</TE>
<TE>   Miserable as he was, he didn't complain about Charlotte or Silas.
He just got to work.</TE>
<TE>   "That's to his credit," says Silas, "because he really suffered
that whole year."</TE>
<TE>   The next season, with Jones the latest to bail, Silas opened a
spot for Davis, moving the 6-foot Wesley to shooting guard. They were
short, but they were good too.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets staged a surprise run in the playoffs, blowing out
Miami in a three-game sweep, then taking the Milwaukee Bucks to Game
7 in the Eastern Conference semifinals, as fans, who had deserted by
the thousands, rushed back into the Hive.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, however, a referendum on a new arena was rejected, and
Shinn and his new co-owner, Ray Wooldridge, started looking for a new
home.</TE>
<TE>   Not that secrecy was their forte. Each flew into Louisville, Ky.,
on his own executive jet, which were both parked conspicuously in the
open.</TE>
<TE>   Fans streamed out of the Hive. Almost unnoticed, it became Davis'
show as Mashburn, the Hornets' leading scorer, went out for three
months.</TE>
<TE>   All but forgotten, the Hornets remain a young, deep, if still
sleeping giant in the runt-filled East. Not that it comes up much,
but Silas and team President Bob Bass have done a remarkable job of
keeping up with the talent drain, bringing in dark-horse prospects
such as Jamal Magloire and Lee Nailon. Their 18-14 road record is the
conference's best.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they're only 12-18 in the all-but-deserted Hive.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially after the run we had last year," says Davis. "You see
23-24,000 rowdy fans in the gym and then you come back, season
opener, and you barely have 13-15,000. It's kind of disappointing.
It's like, what's the point of being there?</TE>
<TE>   "And you hear all these talks about if we move here, it'll be sold
out every night. It's kinda disheartening to run out and, basically,
nobody's there, your family and friends, watching you warm up. It's
tough, man. It's terrible, actually."</TE>
<TE>   He's back home tonight as the Hornets play the Lakers, which is
always exciting for the neighborhood kids from 88th and Towne where
he lived with his grandparents, the Nicholsons. Last time in, he took
30 of them to the Hornets' shoot-around and the game against the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Davis will be coming through fast this time, at the end
of a trip before the Hornets return to Charlotte for what could their
last hurrah in the Carolinas.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, you get the feeling it's going to turn out all right, for
Davis, anyway.</TE>

<LD>Cleveland Indian bench coach Grady Little was hired Monday as manager
of the Boston Red Sox, joining a team with new owners eager to win
the franchise's first World Series title since 1918.</LD>
<LD>   Little replaced interim manager Mike Cubbage, who took over when
Joe Kerrigan was fired March 5.</LD>
<LD>   "I do consider myself a lucky man to be able to manage in the
major leagues," Little said when introduced at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Little, 52, managed 16 years in the minors for Baltimore, Toronto
and Atlanta and was selected manager of the year four times.</TE>
<TE>   Players said Little introduced himself with a handshake.</TE>
<TE>   "He greeted everybody. You could tell he was excited," first
baseman Brian Daubach said. "All the uncertainty is gone. Now we can
focus on April 1."</TE>
<TE>   The team said Little signed a two-year contract with options but
wouldn't give financial details.</TE>

<LD>Steve Jacobson of Newsday writes that former Dodger Mike Piazza is a
New Yorker all the way now:</LD>
<LD>   "He comes from Norristown, Pa., which is sort of Philadelphia
territory, and he grew up as a baseball player in Los Angeles, which
is someplace else. New Yorkers like to feel the natural superiority
over Los Angeles, in spite of the weather, and of course we're right.</LD>
<LD>   "'I'm an East Coast guy,' [Piazza] said. 'West Coast attitude is
different. The East Coast is more passionate. It has a deeper
history; the fans are more intense, less laid-back.'"</LD>
<TE>   Intense, or rude? But we won't quibble, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: When did UCLA first play in the NCAA men's basketball
tournament?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A true visionary: Jack Curry of the New York Times on the
exceptional eyesight and depth perception of the Yankees' Jason
Giambi:</TE>
<TE>   "[He] has 20/13 vision in his right eye, his lead eye as a
left-handed batter. That means he can identify an object from 20 feet
that a person with 20/20 vision can see from 13 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "But even more important is his depth perception. Bill Harrison,
an optometrist who has worked with professional athletes for three
decades, said Giambi is in the top 1% of thousands of baseball
players he has tested.</TE>
<TE>   "'I can pick up the ball right when [a pitcher] lets it go,'
Giambi said. 'It's a huge advantage. I got God-gifted when it came to
the eyes.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trojans are in: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post has already
selected his Final Four. And they are: "Southern Cal from the South,
Arizona from the West, Maryland from the East and Kansas from the
Midwest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Wilbon: "My hero today is Dickie Vitale. Did you see him go
ballistic on ESPN's selection show? Called out the selection
committee for being the chumps they are, called out Digger Phelps for
refusing to let Notre Dame play the University of Detroit when Vitale
was coach there. I love Vitale for this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It won't happen: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Boo to
the NCAA tournament committee for lacking the imagination to put
Indiana and Texas Tech in the same regional.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way Bob Knight's old and new teams can meet now is in
the national championship game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Never a doubt: Chris Ross made a 50-foot shot with seven-tenths of
a second remaining that sent San Antonio Jay past Dallas Kimball,
54-53, for the Class 5A high school state title in Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Ross scored his only basket of the tournament on his 17th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like I drew it up," said Jay Coach Romy Vela.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What, no A-1 sauce? Gary Trent of the Minnesota Timberwolves
comparing himself and teammates Kevin Garnett and Marc Jackson to a
menu: "We're using our beef inside. Kevin is the flank cut, Marc is
the porterhouse and I'm the New York strip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 1950. The Bruins lost to Bradley, 73-59, in a
first-round West Regional game in Kansas City, Mo., on March 24, then
lost a consolation game to Brigham Young the following day, 83-62.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "Instead of
a playoff, the three-way tie atop the Ivy League standings was
settled by SAT scores."</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers handle Minnesota, 108-99, for
third win in a row on trip as they climb back into playoff race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Well, it's a race now.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers went into the Target Center and took a victory Monday
from the Minnesota Timberwolves, 108-99, before a disbelieving crowd
of 17,992. The Clippers' third consecutive road victory moved them
within 11/2 games of a playoff spot in the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Took?</LD>
<TE>   Fact is, the Clippers reached out and grabbed the game from  the
hands of a team that, at least in the NBA's standings, is vastly
superior. They won on a court where very few visiting teams win.</TE>
<TE>   And they accomplished it with such remarkable poise and confidence
down the stretch that Elton Brand was moved to bellow at teammate
Quentin Richardson during a fourth-quarter timeout: "We're supposed
to win these games."</TE>
<TE>   Weeks ago--days ago even--it would have seemed preposterous. But
it happened Monday, when the Clippers' bench outscored Minnesota's
reserves, 54-15, and when six players scored 10 points or more and
only three did for the Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not real that I'm in a playoff hunt," Brand later joked with
reporters. "We're going home with a three-game winning streak. All on
the road. If you had told us early in the season that we would do
that on the road, we would never have believed it."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' victory coupled with the Utah Jazz's loss to the
Memphis Grizzlies and the Seattle SuperSonics' defeat against the
Dallas Mavericks tightened the race for a playoff berth. The
ninth-place Clippers are 11/2 games behind the eighth-place Jazz and
three behind the seventh-place SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota lost its fourth in a row and suffered only its sixth
loss in 29 games at home. Kevin Garnett led the Timberwolves with 26
points and Joe Smith had 25, overshadowing the Clippers' best
players.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers simply had more good players than the Timberwolves
and used that to their advantage. For instance, Minnesota suffocated
Brand and Michael Olowokandi, holding them to 15 and four points,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   But other Clippers made significant contributions, starting with
reserves Richardson, Darius Miles and Sean Rooks. Minnesota had no
answer for Richardson's 17 points, Miles' 20 or Rooks' 13 (including
11 in the fourth quarter).</TE>
<TE>   And Jeff McInnis won the battle of the point guards, scoring 17
points with 14 assists. Minnesota's Chauncey Billups scored 18 points
and had eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   The teams were tied, 75-75, to start the fourth, but the Clippers
immediately went on a 17-4 tear. Minnesota never recovered and never
threatened late as the Clippers maintained a double-digit lead for
most of the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they were not going to let Elton or Michael beat
them," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "They double-teamed them
every time we threw the ball in there. It shows we're growing as a
team because we passed the ball right back outside."</TE>
<TE>   And into the waiting hands of Richardson, Miles and Rooks.</TE>
<TE>   "Darius Miles was sensational," Gentry said of the 20-year-old
forward.</TE>
<TE>   At the buzzer, the Clippers raced off the court, through their
postgame showers and onto the bus that would carry them to the
airport and their flight back home.  They were 3-1 on their four-game
trip to the Snow Belt, and they believed they should have won at
Milwaukee to start their final lengthy trek of the season.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, their three-game road streak is the longest since they
won three in a row between Feb. 19-22 last season. The Clippers also
concluded a dizzying stretch of 25 of 35 games away from Staples
Center with a credible 18-17 record.</TE>
<TE>   What's left isn't easy, but the Clippers finish with 10 of their
final 18 at home, including a "road" game against the Lakers, and
leave the Pacific time zone only once more.</TE>
<TE>   With six victories in seven games and eight in their last 12, the
Clippers seem poised to challenge for their first playoff appearance
since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got a ton of work to do," Gentry said. "We know that.
We'll go home now and get back to Staples and take care of business."</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry had no update to give on injured Clippers Keyon
Dooling, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom. It's not that he's
unconcerned about them, but Gentry can't wish them back to health.</LD>
<LD>   It's possible Dooling (ankle), Maggette (hand and knee) and Odom
(wrist and ankle) will be sidelined for the rest of the regular
season. Gentry said he will know more about their status when the
team returns to L.A. today.</LD>
<LD>   Odom is perhaps the closest of the three to being fit to play,
although that's asking a great deal from him.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got to be prepared to play with what we have here," Gentry
said Monday. "So far, the guys we've asked to step up have done that
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Tremaine Fowlkes and guard Doug Overton are expected to be
signed for the rest of the season after their 10-day contracts run
out, Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes has signed two 10-day deals already and is entrenched as
the team's starting small forward.</TE>
<TE>   Overton has become Jeff McInnis' backup at point guard.</TE>

<TE>   Eric Piatkowski outplayed Wally Szczerbiak, his counterpart at
shooting guard, which was one of several keys to the Clippers'
victory Monday over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Piatkowski outscored
him, 14-7, badgering him with a brand of defense not often seen this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to watch some film and I saw how he likes to get his
shots," Piatkowski said. "I let the other guys worry about Kevin
Garnett. When you just stay on one guy, it's pretty easy to guard
him. And it's not like he likes to put the ball on the floor. He's a
lot like me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders was ejected after drawing two
technical fouls with 7:51 remaining in the third quarter and the
teams tied, 57-57. Referee Jack Nies bounced Saunders after hearing
several magic words. Assistant coach Jerry Sichting took over for
Saunders.... The Clippers play host to the Michael Jordan-less
Washington Wizards at Staples Center on Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Daytona 500: An Official History"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Bob Zeller</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: David Bull Publishing, Phoenix</TE>
<TE>   Price: $39.95</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Daytona 500 isn't in the book, but that's the only thing
missing from the year-by-year history of the Great American Race,
stock car racing's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Zeller, a former Long Beach newspaperman, chronicles every
race, beginning with the 1959 inaugural which took three days before
Lee Petty was declared the winner over Johnny Beauchamp, who left
Daytona International Speedway thinking he was the winner.</TE>
<TE>   There was no photo-finish camera at the race and the decision was
reached by a collection of newspaper and newsreel footage that showed
Petty's Oldsmobile inches in front.</TE>
<TE>   All of the photographs in the 192-page coffee table-sized book
came from archives of the International Speedway Corp., owner of the
Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Zeller meticulously rummaged through newspaper files to prepare
his text for each race.</TE>
<TE>   Of special interest are the legendary races, such as Petty's
controversial victory in 1959, David Pearson limping across the
finish line at 30 mph to edge Richard Petty in 1976, the fourth-turn
fisticuffs between Cale Yarborough and the Allison brothers, Donnie
and Bobby, in 1981, Dale Earnhardt's heartbreaking loss to Derrike
Cope in 1990 and his emotional victory in 1998, and 2001 when Michael
Waltrip won on the day NASCAR President Mike Helton had to say,
"We've lost Dale Earnhardt."</TE>
<TE>   It's all there, wonderfully written.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Izturis Looks Like No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It seems apparent to just about everyone in Dodger camp--players,
coaches, reporters, clubhouse attendants, groundskeepers--that
22-year-old Cesar Izturis has all but locked up the shortstop job,
even though Manager Jim Tracy said he hasn't decided whether Izturis
or Alex Cora will start.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy seemed to go out of his way to break Cora's fall Monday when
he was asked why Cora was starting at shortstop and Izturis at second
base in the Dodgers' 5-0 exhibition loss to the New York Mets.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy began by saying both could play either middle infield
position, but then he veered off course with an unsolicited promotion
of Cora, who was the starter last season.</LD>
<TE>   "I want that shortstop to understand that I still think he's a
darn good defensive player," Tracy said. "I don't want him to lose
sight of that."</TE>
<TE>   Have Cora's spirits sagged under the weight of Izturis' rave
reviews? His manager thinks not. "He's not down," Tracy said. "I have
to look at contingencies. I haven't made up my mind who the shortstop
will be, but whoever it is, we have to be prepared in case of
injury."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Cora, who has had plenty of time at second base this
spring and may play some third, will be considered for a utility
infield job, but he will have to hit better than he did last season
(.217, four home runs, 29 runs batted in) to edge Jeff Reboulet for
that role. There's a slim chance Cora and Reboulet both could make
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Cora is out of minor league options, so he would have to clear
waivers before being sent to triple-A Las Vegas. The Dodgers have
virtually no depth at shortstop in the upper levels of their farm
system and don't want to lose Cora, whose $625,000 contract could
deter some teams from claiming him.</TE>
<TE>   Cora has handled the situation with class. He and Izturis have
become friends, and while Cora does not seem eager to discuss his
potential demotion, he is not bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just worried about myself," said Cora, who ranged deep behind
second base to field Edgardo Alfonzo's third-inning grounder and
threw to first for the out Monday. "I'm doing what's asked, catching
the ball, getting some hits, taking my walks. I'm just doing my
thing. That's all I have to say."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers lose a one-run game to the Mets this season because
New York catcher Mike Piazza cuts down the potential tying run in the
ninth with a superb block of the plate, they will have one of their
own to thank.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza took what he called "a crash course in catching" this
winter from former Dodger catcher Steve Yeager, spending a week with
Yeager at the Bucky Dent Academy in Delray Beach, Fla. Yeager will
join the Dodgers today as a temporary catching instructor.</TE>
<TE>   "Being in the big leagues for 10 years, you're never too old to go
back to school," Piazza said. "[Yeager] noticed I wasn't balanced on
my throws, I was rushing my throws, and I wasn't in great position on
plays at the plate. He was a great catcher, and it was an honor to
work with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever expect to be Ivan Rodriguez behind the plate, but if
there's one little piece of the game that can make me a better
player, if I can show the organization I'm committed to improve, I'll
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Many speculated Piazza, 33, would have moved to first base by now,
but a winter trade for first baseman Mo Vaughn, who has three years
remaining on his contract, will keep Piazza behind the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where all that talk about me moving to first came
from; I've beaten that rap for how many years now?" Piazza said. "I
go week to week. I don't think long-term about it. As long as I'm in
good shape and still enjoy catching, I'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, sidelined because of a sore
right hamstring, will make his first Grapefruit League start today.
Center fielder Tom Goodwin, out because of a strained muscle in his
left side, also was cleared to play.... Potential closer Matt Herges
gave up three runs and four hits Monday and walked pitcher Grant
Roberts with the bases loaded in the eighth inning. Tracy didn't seem
concerned. "He's surrendered a few runs, but he's a power pitcher,
and he has to build himself up to where he left off last year," Tracy
said....The Dodgers had three hits against the Mets, same as Sunday
against Houston.</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Accused of Cover-Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FLEMINGTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors filed more charges Monday against Jayson Williams in the
shooting death of a limousine driver at his mansion, alleging the
former NBA star wiped his fingerprints off the shotgun and told
guests to tell police it was suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 34, has already been charged with manslaughter in the
Feb. 14 shooting of Costas Christofi. Prosecutors have said the
former New Jersey Net was handling the shotgun recklessly.</LD>
<LD>   The new charges are hindering apprehension, evidence tampering,
witness tampering, fabricating physical evidence and conspiracy to
obstruct the law, which carry a combined penalty of more than 14
years in prison. Manslaughter carries up to 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   Williams surrendered at the courthouse Monday and posted $20,000
bail before leaving.</TE>
<TE>   After Christofi was shot, Williams removed his own clothes and
tried to hide them, officials said. He also allegedly tried to
position the shotgun at an angle to make it seem as if the driver
shot himself.</TE>
<TE>   Williams wiped his fingerprints off the shotgun, then "attempted
to imprint the victim's fingerprints upon the very same shotgun in an
effort to convince investigators that the shooting had been
self-inflicted," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses at Williams' estate told police Williams told
them to lie "in order to convince detectives that the victim's death
had been self-inflicted," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of his guests, Kent Culuko, 29, and John W. Gordnick, 44, were
also charged Monday with evidence tampering, hindering apprehension
and conspiracy to obstruct the law. Culuko was also charged with
witness tampering.</TE>

<HD>Kings Keep It Simple and Win</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Murray's return to Staples Center after recovering
from accident is greeted with a gritty 2-1 victory over Chicago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since his Feb. 15 accident, Coach Andy Murray was
behind the Kings' bench for a game at Staples Center on Monday. And
he couldn't have been treated to a better effort from his team.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings fell one short of matching a franchise record for fewest
shots allowed in a game and used goals by Ziggy Palffy and Philippe
Boucher to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks, 2-1, in front of 16,956.</LD>
<LD>   With their victory, the Kings improved to 31-22-9-4 and moved into
the No. 5 playoff spot in the Western Conference with 75 points. King
goaltender Felix Potvin faced only 11 shots and stopped 10 to help
the Kings move to 17-6-2-2 over their last 27 games.</LD>
<TE>   "All of the games are big right now, and it doesn't matter who
we're playing," said Boucher, who scored his game-winning goal with
4:59 left.  "Every day the standings are going to change. You lose a
couple of games and you're almost out and if you win a couple, you
can move almost into first place."</TE>
<TE>   In his third game since returning to the team after his
single-vehicle accident and post-concussion recovery, Murray was glad
to see his team hold off the pesky Blackhawks, who began the game
second in the Central Division with 80 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight's game was a credit to our players," said Murray, whose
team outshot Chicago, 32-11. "They stayed relentless for 60 minutes.
We were on top of [the Blackhawks] from the drop of the puck."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, which played without injured center Alex Zhamnov, had
problems with the Kings all night.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a good job in the neutral zone," Chicago Coach Brian
Sutter said. "Their defense, I thought, was real good. They battled,
they didn't fool around with the puck. When they didn't have a play,
they used the glass and kept it going ahead and they checked hard."</TE>
<TE>   For the first 20 minutes, the Kings blitzed Chicago goaltender
Jocelyn Thibault from all angles. But despite their aggressive
attack, which saw them register the first 11 shots, the Kings didn't
get the puck past Thibault until 18.6 seconds were left in the
period.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Palffy and Jason Allison teamed up for a highlight
goal after forcing a Chicago turnover deep in the Blackhawks' zone.
Palffy finished the play with a turnaround slap shot from the slot
for his 25th goal of the season and 11th over his last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play a simple game," said Palffy, who has 26 points
over his last 24 games. "Right now, everyone is trying to win, so it
is up to us to keep it simple."</TE>
<TE>   With a 1-0 lead and a 12-2 edge in shots after one period, the
Kings found themselves tied with the Blackhawks less than two minutes
into the second. After shaking free from the Kings' Craig Johnson,
Chicago's Tyler Arnason scored his third goal of the season when he
was able to squeeze the puck between Potvin's right skate and the
left goal post at 1:54.</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, both teams had solid opportunities to score
but either missed the net or were stopped by the goalies. That lasted
until nearly five minutes were left when the Kings finally broke
through on Boucher's goal.</TE>
<TE>   With most of the action near the Chicago bench, Boucher switched
sides with his defense partner Mathieu Schneider and took a pass from
Palffy on the left side. Then, from inside the blue line, Boucher
launched a blast that beat Thibault to give the Kings a 2-1 lead at
15:01.</TE>
<TE>   "I put it on net as hard as I could," Boucher said about his
winning goal. "I tried to beat [Thibault] on his right side. I got a
good piece of it, got lucky and it went in."</TE>
<TE>   From there, it was only a matter of holding on for the Kings, who
improved to 14-12-5-1 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a great job of backchecking and we weren't able to get
any rushes," Chicago right wing Tony Amonte said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who do not play again until Thursday, know this was a
great start for a key three-game homestand.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to keep doing more of the same," Boucher said. "I
think we dominated this game.... We did everything the way we wanted
to do."</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Takes It Easy With Toe</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal sat contentedly on a large purple practice ball
Monday afternoon, 21 games from the playoffs, a most-valuable-player
run and a third consecutive championship in him yet, perhaps.</LD>
<LD>   That depends largely on the toe. It's the toe that grips a team
and a city, and that is why O'Neal watched and rested and 10
teammates ran, and why Coach Phil Jackson and his practices have
taken an edgier spirit in recent days. Nearing the end of a
harmonious season, the first in years for the Lakers and their famous
egos, Jackson's grandest accomplishment yet might be to have five
healthy players on the floor and pointed in the same direction come
mid-April.</LD>
<LD>   Samaki Walker, once his starting forward, wore a wrap on his
hyper-extended right elbow. A team physician told Walker on Sunday
that he would need another week to heal, putting his recovery closer
to Sunday's game against the Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<TE>   Rick Fox, with a grimace on his face, pulled back the bottom of
his shorts to reveal a thick, blue bruise on his right knee. Kobe
Bryant's left hand hurts only when he picks up a basketball. Brian
Shaw has a sore right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm on emergency duty," Shaw said, and then laughed.
"I guess nothing's changed, actually."</TE>
<TE>   About a month has passed since O'Neal reworked his shoes and
orthotics. The pain has eased some but not enough, no matter what his
recent numbers say. It is likely, therefore, that he will return to
Dr. Robert Mohr, the UCLA specialist, in the coming days to discuss a
new tack.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal waded without expression through waiting reporters Monday,
though by all accounts the birthday bash he hosted the night before
was quite a hit.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Polishing Off Game and Opponent</HD>
<DH>Tennis: After a tentative first set, he sweeps to victory
against Fish, then goes to practice court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>The Pete Sampras project, a.k.a. the not so young and the restless,
inched forward nicely in the desert here Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The greatest player in the history of the game, as measured by his
unprecedented 13 titles in Grand Slam events, played a bit with fire
in the first round of the Pacific Life Open, as is his wont, and
almost got burned before turning it on like a player much younger
than 30. Singed by Sampras' afterburners was a youngster named Mardy
Fish, 10 years Sampras' junior and a qualifier for this event.</LD>
<LD>   The final score in this featured match of the day was 7-6 (5),
6-2, and for a while in the first set, it looked as if, for Sampras,
this was either going to be the beginning of the end or the end of
the beginning. With Sampras these days, there are images of Kobe
Bryant taking off from 10 feet and dunking and images of Willis Reed
limping out of the tunnel--often in the same match.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras, two-time winner of this event, but seeded 10th this year
and without a title since the historic 2000 Wimbledon when he won
Grand Slam No. 13, nevertheless was playing a newcomer who was seeing
the greatest serve in tennis for the first time in a match, was
wearing black shoes and a bright red shirt and doesn't even spell his
name right.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the master was struggling.</TE>
<TE>   There were no break points in the first set, and Sampras was
spraying baseline shots like a guy trying to kill mosquitoes. His
serve, of course, was keeping him in it, and one of the more potent
weapons in sport carried him all the way to a tiebreaker. At 5-5 of
the tiebreaker, it was youth that was not served.</TE>
<TE>   Fish, a big server who feels most comfortable staying on the
baseline, rather than following in his blasts, decided to approach
the net. But he did so behind a cross-court forehand, presenting
Sampras, who has one of the most dangerous forehands in the game,
with a choice of angles. He chose a cross-court blast, and Fish,
uncomfortable inside the service lines, clunked a forehand volley
into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras said afterward that Fish had made a good play and had
merely taken his eye off the ball. But the netted volley gave Sampras
set point on his serve, and, for what seems like the 10-millionth
time in his career, he toed the line and cranked an ace, this one at
116 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The second set might as well have been Kobe making slam dunks.</TE>
<TE>   Matter of fact, the only startling part of the evening, other than
Fish taking Sampras to a tiebreaker, was Sampras heading back out to
the practice courts with new coach Jose Higueras immediately after
the match.</TE>
<TE>   Asked later how long it had been since he practiced after
finishing a match, he smiled and said, "Been a long time, maybe 10
years."</TE>
<TE>   The smile probably meant that the real answer was never.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras appears to be as sincere about this new push to get back
to the top as he has ever been. He says he chose Higueras, after
recently parting coaching company with close friends Paul Annacone
and Tom Gullikson simply because Annacone and Gullikson were, indeed,
close friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I was too comfortable," Sampras said.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights of Monday's first-round men's action included a
tough 6-4, 6-4 victory by No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt over former No. 1
Carlos Moya. Spaniard Moya had a cup of coffee at No. 1 two years
ago, a ranking achieved at this event. Hewitt, the Australian who
beat Sampras in last year's U.S. Open final, has now won 13 matches
in a row in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Also winning was the player who beat Sampras in the U.S. Open
final the year before, Russian Marat Safin. Safin beat a little
fireplug from Spain, Alberto Martin, who had four sets points at 5-6
of the second set, couldn't convert, and then lost a tiebreaker for a
final 6-3, 7-6 (4) result. Safin, with perhaps the greatest body and
physical prowess in the men's game but missing the matching mental
part, overcame crying babies, annoying public-address announcement
ads from nearby courts and his own general lack of focus at key
moments to eventually simply outmuscle the 160-pound Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, at 28 also drifting
into what Sampras is now calling the "twilight period," beat up on
his personal punching bag, Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, 7-5, 6-3. They
have played eight times and Kafelnikov has won eight.</TE>

<HD>Loss Ruins Big Day for Bulls' Cartwright</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings needed a pair of free throws from Peja
Stojakovic with less than seven seconds left to seal a 107-103
victory over the Bulls on Monday night at Chicago, taking the luster
off some good news for Coach Bill Cartwright.</LD>
<LD>   Cartwright and the Bulls announced before the game that they have
agreed on a three-year option that will make him coach through the
2004-05 season. The deal is worth a reported $4.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a decision that didn't require a lot of work on our part,"
General Manager Jerry Krause said. "Bill has proven that he's going
to be an outstanding coach in this league. He has the skills and the
character we want heading up this program."</LD>
<TE>   Stojakovic scored 29 points, and Vlade Divac added 14 points and
14 rebounds for the Kings, who won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago lost despite a strong effort from Jalen Rose, who had 35
points and a season-high 13 assists. But Rose also had a miss and a
big turnover in the final 20 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We were right there, and I felt the team brought me here to put
us over the top in the last seconds," Rose said. "I'm upset I didn't
get it done for my team."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 93, Denver 78--Tim Duncan had 21 points and nine
rebounds at Denver as the Spurs won their seventh consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio, 13-3 against the Midwest Division, also had a 10-game
winning streak in December and won seven straight in November.</TE>
<TE>   Denver missed its first nine three-point attempts and allowed
several uncontested layups and dunks after not rotating on defense.
The Nuggets finished one for 13 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 79, Utah 78--Pau Gasol scored 20 points and Jason Williams
added 15 to lead the Grizzlies at Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol scored off an alley-oop pass from Williams with 1:06 left as
the Grizzlies erased a one-point deficit and took a 78-77 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol added a free throw with 30.1 seconds left to make the score
79-77. Utah's Jarron Collins was fouled and missed the first free
throw. He made the second for the final one-point margin.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 104, Washington 99--Paul Pierce of the Celtics scored 16 of
his 37 points in the fourth quarter at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, who committed 21 turnovers for the second consecutive
night, have lost 13 of their last 16, including seven of nine without
injured Michael Jordan. They visit the Clippers on Wednesday for the
first of a seven-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 119, Seattle 108--Nick Van Exel made three three-point
baskets early in the fourth quarter, helping the Mavericks out of
their only cold spell and on their way to a victory at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks scored a season-best 71 points in the first half and
led by 18 in the third quarter until a series of missed jumpers let
the SuperSonics get within five early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel made a three-point shot as the 24-second clock expired,
then swished another after Seattle got within four. Steve Nash
chipped in another three-pointer, then one more by Van Exel put
Dallas back up, 103-92.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 121, Golden State 96--Jason Terry scored 32 points at
Atlanta as the Hawks set a season high for points.</TE>
<TE>   After a pair of free throws from Adonal Foyle cut the Atlanta lead
to 39-36 with 8:04 left in the second, the Hawks went on a 26-12 run
that essentially sealed the victory by the end of the quarter.</TE>

<HD>BCS Creator Kramer to Quit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Kramer, who changed the way college football decides its national
champion, is expected to retire as early as today as commissioner of
the Southeastern Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Two sources with knowledge of Kramer's plans and speaking on
condition of anonymity said he will step down after 12 years on the
job. The SEC called a news conference for today at its headquarters
in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   Kramer, 72, will attend, along with SEC President Robert Khayat
and Arkansas Chancellor John White, the SEC said. It did not release
details about the nature of the news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Kramer, former athletic director at Vanderbilt, put millions of
dollars in the coffers of the 12 member schools in the SEC. But it
was his bowl championship series formula that made him a
national--and largely unpopular--figure.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Kramer became head of the committee that was charged with
figuring out the best system for determining a national Division I-A
football champion.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Kramer got the four major bowls--Sugar, Fiesta,
Orange and Rose--and the major conferences to agree to the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS uses a complex formula, combining the Associated Press and
coaches' polls, strength of schedule, computer rankings and number of
losses, to come up with the top two teams to play for the BCS title.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every year, there has been some dispute over who belonged
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the BCS called for a playoff to crown a champion, but
Kramer never wavered.</TE>
<TE>   He reveled in the fact that the disputed system created debate and
that the entire bowl system remained intact, keeping dozens of
schools and all those lesser bowl games alive and making money.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley has been widely mentioned
as a possible successor to Kramer. But a source close to Foley,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday he had no interest in
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible candidate is Mark Whitworth, the league's
executive associate commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's true, the SEC would lose a tremendous leader," Foley
said. "He's done outstanding things in this league, and every school
has benefited from his leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   It would take a surprise to keep Mike Tyson from getting a boxing
license in Washington. The judges' scorecards are already well in his
favor going into today's public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The three-member D.C. Boxing and Wrestling Commission bypassed
protocol with an unofficial 3-0 vote in Tyson's favor last month, and
they've given every indication that the actual vote, which is
expected immediately after the hearing, will go the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've given the impression that we've been favorable,"
commission vice chairman Michael Brown said. "I haven't said it's a
done deal."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he would need tangible medical or psychological reasons
to vote against Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   The Jacksonville Jaguars restructured the contract of defensive
end Tony Brackens, allowing them to match an offer sheet given to
cornerback Jason Craft.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars also signed defensive end Stalin Colinet, a six-year
veteran. Terms of Brackens' restructuring weren't available.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Olson resigned as the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback coach
to return to the coaching staff at Purdue.... The Miami Dolphins
signed guard Leon Searcy to a one-year, $750,000 contract and wide
receiver Dedric Ward to a two-year contract extension.... George
Dyer, in his eighth season as a Denver Bronco assistant, was made
assistant head coach.... Tight end Dave Moore, who played nine
seasons for Tampa Bay, was signed by the Buffalo Bills.... Wide
receiver Corey Bradford signed a three-year, $5.25-million deal with
the Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Race officials reported the first dog death in this year's
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.</TE>
<TE>   The dead dog was a 5-year-old male, Goro, belonging to musher Jim
Oehlschlaeger. Race marshal Mark Nordman said the dog died Sunday
night. The cause of death was not determined.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly, Matt Kuchar and Rory Sabbatini received Masters
Invitations to play in next month's tournament, increasing the number
of players in the field to 98. There is one spot left, for a player
not otherwise qualified for the Masters, awarded to the winner of the
Players Championship. The Masters is April 11-14.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Two French-made, portable land-to-air missiles will be deployed
outside South Korean stadiums during World Cup soccer games to
prevent possible terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Military jets will patrol the skies over the stadiums during the
tournament, air force spokesman 1st Lt. Kim Ki-Ho said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The air force will make sure jet noise does not affect matches, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   The security plans are the latest in a series of measures being
planned by South Korean officials to safeguard their portion of the
tournament, to be played from May 31 to June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Five French special police force members arrived in Seoul on
Monday for five days of training with their South Korean
counterparts. It will include hostage rescue operations.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean police will make a return visit to the French special
police forces headquarters near Paris next month.</TE>
<TE>   France was host to the 1998 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team will play its three first-round matches in South
Korea. South Korea has set up an anti-terrorism unit and imposed
no-fly zones for non-air force planes over World Cup stadiums and
nuclear power plants during the tournament.</TE>

<DH>Eighteen Schools Have the Best of Both Worlds in NCAA
Fields</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are 18 of them, Division I colleges proudly represented in both
the men's and women's NCAA basketball tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   Big schools, small schools. North, East, South and West schools.
Football schools, non-football schools. State schools, private
schools.</LD>
<LD>   There are schools where national football titles are expected
(Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia) and schools that celebrate
any football win at all (Indiana, Kent State).</LD>
<TE>   There are schools with only men's basketball titles (Cincinnati,
Duke, Indiana, Wisconsin) and those that have never sniffed a men's
Final Four (Kent State, Creighton, Pepperdine, UC Santa Barbara),
others that have won only women's titles (Texas Tech, Texas, Notre
Dame) and some that have won both (Connecticut, Stanford).</TE>
<TE>   There are three Catholic schools (Notre Dame, Boston College and
Creighton). There are schools most known for baseball teams
(Mississippi State).</TE>
<TE>   Schools with big, new arenas (Wisconsin, Texas Tech) and schools
with high school gyms (Pepperdine, UC Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   There are schools where the men's and women's coaches are good
buddies.</TE>
<TE>   "When Paul Westphal took our men's job," Pepperdine women's Coach
Mark Trakh said, "the first thing he did was take the women's staff
out to lunch. We've been friends since."</TE>
<TE>   Yet at Connecticut, the animosity between men's Coach Jim Calhoun
and women's Coach Geno Auriemma is legendary. The two barely speak.
Calhoun's dismay at the publicity and popularity of the women's team
during the 1995 season was widely reported as was Calhoun's feeling
that his efforts in building a strong men's program were not
appreciated enough. Auriemma, no wallflower, was not silent in his
bemusement at Calhoun's gripes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the last five years, each has won a national title which
goes to show that everybody doesn't have to get along.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years ago, the administration at Oklahoma was ready to drop
women's basketball. Now the Sooner women have a No. 1 seeding and the
men a No. 2. Duke has produced two No. 1-seeded teams, men and women.
Three years ago, Duke's president was chartering a plane to fly
between the men's and women's Final Fours because his school was
represented in both places.</TE>
<TE>   "What a great thing," Duke men's Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it neat?" Duke women's Coach Gail Goestenkors agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Trakh says it warms the heart of all women's coaches to hear what
happened at Notre Dame, the 2001 NCAA women's champions.</TE>
<TE>   "Their athletic director said that things would be exactly the
same at women's games and men's games," Trakh says. "The band would
play, there would be cheerleaders, all the concession stands would be
open, and it wouldn't matter how many people are in the stands. What
happens? The boyfriends of the cheerleaders come to the games. The
families of the band members. And they bring friends and pretty soon
the arena fills up."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it's not so easy.</TE>
<TE>   The women at Syracuse, tired of seeing the men win 20 or more
games year after year and always making the NCAA tournament, marched
into the athletic director's office and said, basically, "We're not
taking this anymore."</TE>
<TE>   That was two years ago. The Orangewomen are in the NCAA tournament
this year for only their third time in history. Unfortunately, the
men didn't make it.</TE>
<TE>   Trakh has been a successful coach at both a high school--Brea
Olinda--and a college where, he says, there have been commitments by
school administrators to having winning programs for both sexes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why you have some schools with a rich men's
basketball tradition, then why you wouldn't have a strong women's
program," Trakh says.</TE>
<TE>   Trakh noted, for example, that Kentucky, which has a rich men's
basketball tradition, a great high school basketball tradition in a
state filled with smart fans and lots of players, playing in the
Southeastern Conference, which has dominated women's college
basketball, has not come close to offering a consistently strong
women's team.</TE>
<TE>   "What I don't understand about that," Trakh says, "is that when
you have a quality men's team and a quality women's team, it makes
the university look good. It shows a commitment on a lot of levels
that should be a positive for a university at any level."</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma at Connecticut and Pat Summitt at Tennessee have been
credited with having the strong wills, as well as the talent, to
build dominating programs at universities more traditionally
accustomed to strong men's sports (men's basketball at Connecticut
and football at Tennessee).</TE>
<TE>   Trakh thinks that when Summitt and Auriemma eventually leave their
jobs, those schools will have built such strong traditions, they will
not be so politically unwise as to let them slip.</TE>
<TE>   But at places like Oklahoma, Duke and Notre Dame, where excellence
in women's basketball is new, clear decisions have been made to
accept no less than the kind of success the men have earned.</TE>
<TE>   That's the beauty of basketball, isn't it? If the commitment is in
place, the goal can be achieved almost anywhere. The players are out
there. So are the fans. Connecticut and Tennessee found that out. So
have Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball, the players, the coaches, the fans, the
commitment--that's what they all have in common.</TE>
<TE>   Different schools with different missions and different teams in
different places, but everybody wanting their men, and their women,
to be winners.</TE>

<LD>Now just about every Sunday I wake up to find neighbors Tom &amp; Aida
out front picking up toilet paper.</LD>
<LD>   It's usually an all-day project because it's on the roof, in the
trees, and since the sprinklers have gone off during the night,
there's mush everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   For a while I thought maybe an angry reader had the wrong address
and was TP-ing their house by mistake, but then I got to know Tom &amp;
Aida.</LD>
<TE>   Now, we live in a good neighborhood, so it's the two-ply stuff,
and I know Tom &amp; Aida aren't that upset because some weeks they leave
the stuff hanging here and there for decoration. It goes well with
the Christmas stuff they've never taken down.</TE>
<TE>   I know all this because I've made the mistake of coming out of my
house on Sundays, which makes it unavoidable to talk with them. I
swear they camp outside waiting for someone to come out.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know they have five rolls they retrieved off the top of
the house--"still good for the using," as Aida noted? I do, because
she tried showing them to me.</TE>
<TE>   I mention all this because I had an excuse for watching "A Season
on the Brink" Sunday. I couldn't leave my home and risk running into
Tom &amp; Aida.</TE>
<TE>   That also meant staying inside all day with the wife ... and
finding something on TV she'd have no interest in watching.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TO KEEP her upstairs, of course, I had to watch every minute of
the horrible, depressing movie, and the additional horrible and
depressing Bob Knight coverage that followed, including a horrible
and depressing interview with Digger Phelps. I'll tell you how awful
this night of ESPN broadcasting was--when my wife asked if I wanted
to go out for a walk, I almost agreed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS nothing new in the movie, but there was one telling
comment, later reinforced by Phelps' ridiculous support, that
bothered me.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, portrayed by Brian Dennehy, explained that his job as a
basketball coach was to make "men out of boys." Phelps later
supported Knight's approach and told ESPN's Bob Ley: "People have to
understand a coach has just four years to make men out of boys."</TE>
<TE>   This got me to thinking: How did millions of boys who never had
the good fortune of being abused, humiliated and crushed by a
basketball coach with a Godlike complex go on to become men?</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from experience, I don't know how I would have done it,
had I not worked for some of the editors I know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A FEW years ago HBO followed the University of Tennessee women's
basketball team for an entire season. We got to see the great Pat
Summitt at work, her players spending much of the season in tears,
berated by Summitt and feeling as if they could please no one, before
being driven to winning an NCAA championship.</TE>
<TE>   It's nice to see some people also are dedicated to making women
out of girls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'D LIKE to go into Blockbuster and see "A Season on the Brink"
filed under horror films, on the other side of the room from sports
classics.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know anything more scary than the inspiring message for
high school and youth coaches everywhere at the end of the ESPN bomb:
Knight's team went on to win the Big Ten title and the national
championship a year later ... the ends justifying the means ...
Summitt climbing the ladder to cut down the championship net to
finish off the HBO show.</TE>
<TE>   I swear, these sports productions get any more depressing and I'm
going to have to stop watching TV and take a walk with the wife--with
the understanding we'll need a running start to get past Tom &amp; Aida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BLOOMBERG NEWS service reported Monday that "an interactive
service will allow some viewers of ESPN's NHL telecasts to check
scores, answer trivia questions and shop on the same screen while
watching the game." I know I do everything I possibly can to avoid
actually watching a hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, I lie. I went to the King game Monday night because I wanted
to see how Coach Andy Murray was doing after experiencing a
life-threatening auto accident three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still not completely right," said Murray, who suffered a
severe concussion as well as numerous other injuries. "I've told the
players if I say something screwball on the bench to ignore it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ALMOST hesitate to mention Murray's name in the same story as
Knight and Summitt. The King coach, like former San Diego Charger
coach Mike Riley, is one of the nicest people in professional sports,
a consistent gentleman who also has the ability to command attention
and a top effort from his players.</TE>
<TE>   Take away October and November, and Murray is NHL coach of the
year for bringing the Kings back from oblivion. He has the team in
playoff position now, beginning a testy stretch against
playoff-caliber teams, with 10 of 17 games, including Monday's, at
home.</TE>
<TE>   That's not such a good thing, though, with the Kings standing only
14-12-5 at home after Monday's 2-1 win over Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done well on the road [17-10-4] because it's been a matter
of survival," Murray said. "If you don't come out hard on the road,
you get buried. That's the attitude we have to have now playing at
home, or we're going to get buried."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like some kind of screwball talking to me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DON'T WORRY--I left before the end of the game. I wanted to see
how Murray was doing; I didn't say anything about wanting to see how
the Kings are doing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Ken:</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the story about you and your dad, but I'm pretty sure the
rule on too many clubs is a two-stroke penalty but with a limit of
two holes--or a total of four strokes ... so you actually beat your
dad."</TE>
<TE>   Just wait until I get the chance to tell him.</TE>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's the bespectacled young coach who bows his head and leads a
prayer before his weekly news conferences.</LD>
<LD>   There's the 5-foot-5 point guard who became the tallest man in
Mississippi when his buzzer-beating three-point basket vaulted Ole
Miss to the Sweet 16 last season.</LD>
<LD>   There's the "Provine Posse," three Rebel starters from Jackson
Provine High who pride themselves on the best man-to-man defense in
the Southeastern Conference.</LD>
<TE>   And there is the huge void in the middle, no center on the roster,
no answer for a certain big man in Westwood who slugs milk from
half-gallon jugs during interviews.</TE>
<TE>   As UCLA becomes familiar with its first-round NCAA tournament
opponent, one question looms larger than all the quirky details: Does
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I spell elimination for the Bruins?</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, the potential is there. Ninth-seeded Ole Miss, which
will play UCLA on Friday night in Pittsburgh, mangled two top-10
Southeastern Conference opponents--Florida by 17 points and Alabama
by 28.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rebels have lost six of their last nine and appear plagued
by the same inconsistency as the No. 8-seeded Bruins. And they are
vulnerable to a monster performance by UCLA's 6-11 Dan Gadzuric,
whose calcium-fueled late-season surge could continue against a team
with no starter taller than 6-8.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi does operate in a calmer environment. Unlike the
constant criticism endured by UCLA Coach Steve Lavin, nobody is
calling for the head of Coach Rod Barnes, a popular 36-year-old
former Ole Miss guard who has led the team to the NCAA tournament in
three of his four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   His deeply held religious convictions bother few--as long as he
continues to reel in the state's top recruits. The knock on previous
Rebel coaches was that the best home-grown talent escaped to
Kentucky, Arkansas and other SEC powers.</TE>
<TE>   But a change was signaled when Barnes signed highly regarded 6-8
forward Justin Reed, a Parade All-American from state champion
Provine two years ago. Two of Reed's high school teammates, forward
Aaron Harper and guard David Sanders, eventually made their way to
Oxford as well.</TE>
<TE>   The triple coup revealed that the mild-mannered Barnes can be
cagey. He hired Provine Coach Wayne Brent as an assistant in 1998,
and the players followed.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I didn't want them anywhere I wasn't at," said Brent, who
has known Reed and Harper since they were 11 years old. "I tell you,
I'm selfish about it. I didn't want anybody else coaching them."</TE>
<TE>   Reed, a sophomore, has blossomed into one of the SEC's best
players, leading the team in scoring (14.6 points a game) and
rebounds (7.6).</TE>
<TE>   "Justin has really matured and become a great player in his own
way and his own time," Barnes said. "He's really stepped up the last
10-12 games. But UCLA has a bunch of Justin Reeds."</TE>
<TE>   Harper, a sophomore, averages 11.6 points and leads the team with
78 three-point baskets. Sanders, a redshirt sophomore who played his
freshman year at Tallahassee Junior College, is a 6-3 guard who
averages 12.7 points and is the best defensive player.</TE>
<TE>   In Mississippi's 68-51 victory over then-No. 6-ranked Florida,
Sanders held hot-shooting guard Brett Nelson scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   "I just try to give the team some intangibles, some things that
really don't show up on the stat sheet," Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   Humility is a common thread with the Rebels, long considered
behind Mississippi State and an also-ran in the powerful SEC. They
don't want UCLA to believe an ambush is possible. "We don't have any
McDonald's All-Americans," Sanders said. "Now, I do love to eat at
McDonald's. If they counted all the money I spent at McDonald's, then
I'd be an All-American."</TE>
<TE>   Another assistant is responsible for the presence of the
diminutive Jason Harrison. Barnes took over when Rob Evans left for
Arizona State in 1998 and hired Henderson State Coach Eric Bozeman as
an assistant. Harrison, considered too short for Division I, was set
to enroll at Division II Henderson State in his native Arkansas, but
decided to follow Bozeman and walk on.</TE>
<TE>   He endured chants of "Web-ster, Web-ster" and "Gar-y Cole-man,"
but by last season Harrison grew in stature, gaining third-team
All-SEC honors. And he became a giant in Rebel lore in the second
round of last season's tournament, making the three-point shot that
beat Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   The heroics haven't stopped. Harrison, who averages 10.0 points
and 3.9 assists, triggered Mississippi's 84-56 victory over Alabama
in a regular-season finale the Rebels believed they had to win to
gain an NCAA berth.</TE>
<TE>   "I am thankful, thankful to God, that I've had the chance to be
Jason's coach for these four years," Barnes said. "It just proves
that if you do the right thing, work extremely hard and believe in
what you're doing, you can succeed in life."</TE>
<TE>   Vintage Barnes, crediting the almighty along with one of his
undersized, underdog players.</TE>
<TE>   It's an approach that has worked well enough for the former cotton
picker from the Mississippi Delta to get feelers from Arkansas in its
search for a replacement for Nolan Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never demanded our kids pray at practice or attend chapel; I
just give them the option," Barnes said. "But I don't find much
resistance. In our program, God is first, family is second and the
team is third."</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, presumably, would be a victory over UCLA.</TE>

<LD>When North Carolina Wilmington qualified for the NCAA tournament in
2000, it was the first time in school history that the wallflower
Seahawks had been invited to the Big Dance.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter that they were the 15th-seeded team in the South
Regional. Nor did it upset them that they were scheduled for early
elimination by facing powerful Cincinnati in a first-round game.</LD>
<LD>   The Seahawks were just happy to be in Nashville.</LD>
<TE>   "The first year we went as tourists," Seahawk junior guard Brett
Blizzard said Monday afternoon. "This year is different. We're not
going just to take pictures or see the sights."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, there may be more to see and do in Nashville than in
Sacramento, site of the 13th-seeded Seahawks' first-round game
Thursday against fourth-seeded USC.</TE>
<TE>   But they'd probably have just as much time to explore the
California state capital as they did the Grand Ole Opry two years ago
if they are bounced from the tournament, as expected, by the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, North Carolina Wilmington is not conceding the 4:45 p.m.
game at Arco Arena. The Seahawks, who begin the tournament having won
10 of 12 games, believe they have a legitimate shot at wrecking USC's
hopes of making at least a repeat trip to the Elite Eight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to play hard and try to win," Blizzard said, "and
hopefully stick around a little bit, play like we've been there
before."</TE>
<TE>   Despite traveling cross-country to a western city for a game
that's in the South Regional bracket, North Carolina Wilmington will
be rested, having won the Colonial Athletic Assn. tournament on March
4, winning three games by an average of 15.3 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, who also won the regular-season title with a record
of 14-4, set a school record for victories in going 22-9, the same as
USC.</TE>
<TE>   But three days before tipping off, that's about all the schools
claimed to know about each other.</TE>
<TE>   USC does have tape of the Seahawks because they were Miami of
Ohio's opponent on a game film the Trojans used to prepare for the
RedHawks in December.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, meanwhile, joke that they know of USC only because
their coach has a sleeping disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I know about USC is what I've seen on television,"
Jerry Wainwright said. "I'm a classic insomniac ... that's why I've
seen them play. I have not seen them in person.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Pacific 10] is one of the power conferences and they play
excellent basketball. I've met [USC Coach] Henry Bibby once, but I
don't know him very well at all. They will present a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Few figure the Seahawks to present much of a challenge for the
Trojans. North Carolina Wilmington runs a motion offense that thrives
in slow-down, half-court sets.</TE>
<TE>   Blizzard, a 6-foot-4, 195-pound shooting guard, isn't shy about
letting it fly, taking 213 shots from beyond the three-point arc,
making 39% of them.</TE>
<TE>   The CAA player of the year's 17.5-point average leads the Seahawks
as do his 92 assists and 64 steals.</TE>
<TE>   "People think that we're just a one-dimensional team with me as
the only option," Blizzard said. "But we've got some guys in the post
that can score and some outside shooters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not one-dimensional. We're more than that."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks have an undersized center in 6-8, 250-pound junior
Craig Callahan, North Carolina Wilmington's second-leading scorer
(13.1) and rebounder (5.2).</TE>
<TE>   But Callahan likes to take opposing post players outside, making
39.1% of his three-point shots (36 of 92).</TE>
<TE>   As a team, the Seahawks are shooting 37.7% from three-point
territory.</TE>
<TE>   But their niche is on the defensive end. The Seahawks are giving
up an average of 60.3 points, 11th-best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   USC figures to try to force its will on North Carolina Wilmington
by speeding up the game with its various press defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're expecting some scramble-type defenses to be thrown at us,"
Blizzard said. "They think they've got better athletes than we do and
can force us into some turnovers. We just have to play smart and stay
within ourselves. Be calm."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, whose biggest victory this season was a 58-50 upset
at Minnesota that was their first-ever win against a Big Ten school,
haven't seen the variations of pressing defenses that await them.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have to compress our preparation time," Wainwright said.
"We didn't win 22 games by tricking people.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   But they might want to bring a camera, just in case.</TE>

<HD>Practice Makes Perfect Setup</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Hantuchova upsets No. 3 Henin, 6-3, 6-3, after
impressing the Belgian in workout.</DH>

<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Daniela Hantuchova defeated third-seeded Justine Henin, 6-3, 6-3,
Monday at the Pacific Life Open, but, in reality, the damage was done
several days ago on the practice court.</LD>
<LD>   Henin practiced with Hantuchova and watched the long-legged
18-year-old from Slovakia play wonderfully, hitting the ball hard and
going for broke. Henin, a thoughtful sort, started worrying about
their match.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-year-old Belgian suddenly realized this was the kind of
match she was supposed to win. And the pressure showed as she
double-faulted eight times and won only 45% of the points on her
first serve. Hantuchova had 24 winners to Henin's nine.</LD>
<TE>   In other fourth-round matches, No. 2 Martina Hingis of Switzerland
beat Cara Black of Zimbabwe, 6-0, 6-3; No. 4 Monica Seles had an easy
day against Ai Sugiyama, 6-0, 6-1; No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain defeated No. 7 Silvia Farina Elia of Italy, 6-4, 7-6 (4); No.
12 Lisa Raymond dispatched Anne Kremer of Luxembourg, 6-2, 6-3, and
No. 10 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa rallied from a 2-4 third-set
deficit against Alexandra Stevenson, winning, 6-1, 5-7, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   The day's big comeback was by Emmanuelle Gagliardi of Switzerland,
who saved six match points against Anastasia Myskina of Russia and
won, 1-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5), in 2 hours 31 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   One other leading player was taken out when Anna Smashnova of
Israel defeated No. 6 Meghann Shaughnessy, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   But for those who didn't watch Hantuchova and Henin practice, that
result was the major surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't play a good match," Henin said. "I think I was too
nervous at the beginning of the match. She was strong. I couldn't
develop my game because I was too nervous. I practiced with her some
days ago. I could feel she was playing well. Maybe I was a little bit
afraid of this match."</TE>
<TE>   That seemed surprising since Henin reached the Wimbledon final and
French Open semifinals last year and has been ranked as high as No.
5.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm young also," she said. "I still have many things to learn.
Everybody can beat everybody on the tour. I don't have the experience
of [Venus] Williams or [Lindsay] Davenport or [Jennifer] Capriati or
Hingis in the top 10. I just tried to do my best. Today, it didn't
work.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a young player. She has nothing to lose. She was the
outsider, like I was last year. So, I mean, that's the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova, ranked 26th, admitted that practicing against Henin,
and Hingis, increased her confidence. This was her breakthrough
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, when I played her in the practice, I didn't give her
any chance, the same I did in the match today," Hantuchova said. "I
was very happy what I did in practice, I also did in the match,
because you are under pressure. It's much tougher, but I did it."</TE>

<HD>Six Flags Asks for Study on Coaster Injuries</HD>
<DH>Safety: Amusement park operator wants surgeons to look at
whether visitors' preexisting conditions or rides are to blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major amusement-park operator is entering the debate over whether
roller coasters can cause brain injuries by asking a physician's
group to study the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Six Flags President Gary Story said he believes a study he
requested by the American Assn. of Neurological Surgeons will
reinforce what amusement park officials have said all along--that
roller coasters are one of the safest forms of recreation.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the industry has been trying to put the controversy to
rest by arguing that brain injuries at amusement parks involve people
with preexisting conditions. That appeared to be the case last summer
when two people died after riding roller coasters, one at Six Flags
Magic Mountain in Valencia, the other at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena
Park. Without scientific study, roller coaster proponents and critics
have been unable to engage in a serious safety debate.</LD>
<TE>   "These rides are given the same precision that a fine race car,
that a space shuttle, that bullet trains are given," Story said. His
company operates 39 theme parks, including Magic Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "The safety of this equipment is studied inside out," Story said.
"In every public debate, there are at least two sides. We feel it is
incumbent upon us to give the truth a fair hearing."</TE>
<TE>   The surgeon's group has not yet agreed to conduct the study.</TE>
<TE>   Story's request comes on the heels of an announcement by the Brain
Injury Assn. of America that it is forming a panel of experts to
examine the possible link between roller coasters and brain injuries.
The association is doing so at the urging of Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), who has proposed stricter regulation of amusement-park
rides.</TE>
<TE>   The Brain Injury Assn. is an advocacy and prevention group and
could bring its own biases to the study, Story said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of America should listen to people that really
understand the human brain--the American Assn. of Neurological
Surgeons. Who would you believe?"</TE>
<TE>   The Brain Injury Assn.'s president, Allen Bergman, acknowledged
that his group is in the "advocacy ballgame," but said it has
extended an invitation to industry-recommended experts to sit on the
panel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a witch hunt," Bergman said. "Our intent here is
strictly to review the literature and analyze the science: What do we
know, what don't we know and what do we need to know?"</TE>
<TE>   Markey said he welcomes any additional study that will explain the
apparent increase in brain injuries on roller coasters. A January
article in the Annals of Emergency Medicine highlighted 16 cases,
saying it had found a disturbing trend: one case in 1979, none in the
1980s, 14 in the 1990s and one through August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pleased that Six Flags has taken an interest in lifting the
veil of secrecy that has so far prevented the facts from coming to
light," Markey said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have an interest in ensuring that no patron should visit
Six Flags for a pleasant vacation but leave for a very unpleasant
operation....This issue has been ignored for years. Perhaps now it
will receive the attention it demands."</TE>
<TE>   Stan Pelofsky, president of the American Assn. of Neurological
Surgeons, said the question of whether to undertake a study is in the
"early discussion stage." His group cannot answer whether it will go
ahead "until someone really steps up and says, 'We want the study
done and here are the funds to get it done.'" Markey has authored a
bill that would require amusement parks to report serious injuries to
the federal government and give it the authority to investigate
accidents. That bill has stalled but draws attention each time there
is a serious accident.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Escapes Sylmar Facility</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 17-year-old gang member convicted of trying to gun down three
teenage boys escaped from Juvenile Hall in Sylmar by breaking a
window and scaling a razor-wire-topped fence two days before he faced
a possible life sentence, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Ruben Gilliam, 17, of Los Angeles had been scheduled to
appear at the downtown Criminal Courts Building today, after his
conviction on three counts each of attempted murder and assault with
a deadly weapon.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Grimes issued
a bench warrant for Gilliam after a county probation officer informed
her that the youth had escaped shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Gilliam used a ball extracted from a computer mouse to break the
window of his hillside dorm room, authorities said. He then sprinted
20 yards and hopped a 16-foot fence to reach a car where at least one
accomplice was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Burkert, detention services bureau chief for the county
Probation Department, said there have been eight "serious attempts by
juveniles" in the last three years to flee the complex, where about
500 youths are housed. Gilliam is only the second inmate to break out
of the 30-acre site during that time. The other escape ended with the
boy's capture a few hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Burkert said Juvenile Hall employees contacted the Los Angeles
Police Department within minutes of the escape and that authorities
mounted a brief but intense search of the neighborhoods surrounding
the complex.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD sent a helicopter and a squad car," Burkert said.
"Together with police, our probation personnel also searched the
area."</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials said the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors was told about the escape Monday. But they did not
publicize the incident because they believed Gilliam was no longer in
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Burkert said probation officials followed department policy by
immediately contacting the Foothill Division and the 77th Street
Division, which had initially arrested Gilliam.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had escaped on foot, the neighborhood would have been
notified immediately," Burkert said. "But since he was in a vehicle,
we didn't think he was going to hang around."</TE>
<TE>   But LAPD spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello said the Foothill
Division, which patrols around Juvenile Hall, was not notified of the
escape. A patrol car that happened to be dropping off paperwork at
the hall learned Gilliam was loose and broadcast the information to
other units.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials also defended the department's decision to
house Gilliam at Juvenile Hall, even though he was tried as an adult.
Burkert said juveniles, who must be separated from the general adult
inmate population, have a limited amount of cell space in the
downtown county jail system and are better off in juvenile detention
centers.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Gilliam was convicted of a serious crime
that made him "unfit" to be tried as a juvenile. During his trial,
prosecutors alleged that Gilliam, known by his gang name "Hoodsta
Foot," got out of a white Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme on April 25,
2001, in South Los Angeles and shot three youths with a handgun at
close range.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year-old was shot in the mouth and the others in the arm and
buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   After finding Gilliam unfit to be tried as a juvenile, a court
commissioner ordered the teenager held in a juvenile detention hall
rather than county jail.</TE>

<HD>SAG Board Urges Members to Back Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screen Actors Guild directors late Monday night recommended that
their 98,000 members approve a proposal that would allow limited
investments by advertising firms and production companies in talent
agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The critical 57-44 vote to recommend the deal came after an often
heated debate lasting more than 10 hours over a new "franchise
agreement" negotiated last month between SAG and two groups, the
Assn. of Talent Agents and the National Assn. of Talent
Representatives.</LD>
<LD>   Agents who represent SAG members must abide by the franchise
agreement, which was first forged in 1939 to protect actors from
unscrupulous agents.</LD>
<TE>   The most controversial part of the three-year agreement would
permit investments of up to 10% initially and as much as 20%
eventually in agencies by some companies involved in production.</TE>
<TE>   Agents asked SAG for that right, arguing that current rules hinder
their ability to attract investment capital and create business
ventures.</TE>
<TE>   But some actors, including such prominent stars as Richard
Dreyfuss, argue that any change in the rules creates potential
conflicts of interest, because agents might end up representing
actors in projects in which they have a financial interest.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement package also contains a number of sweeteners for
SAG, including proposals that would help bolster its ailing health
and pension funds and another that would set up a fund to pay actors
when agents fail or misappropriate money.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also would enlist agents in the campaign by actors
to stem runaway production to foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules were a campaign issue in SAG's presidential
election, which was decided Saturday when Melissa Gilbert, a
proponent of the new arrangement with agents, defeated Valerie
Harper, who campaigned against it.</TE>
<TE>   The referendum will be mailed to members April 3, with a return
date of April 18. Gilbert said the referendum would "allow each
member to have a voice in this important decision."</TE>

<HD>Disney's Role Could Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Manager Pierre Gauthier has told Duck players that Disney
intends to become more involved with the team, according to sources.
Gauthier would not elaborate recently on what was meant by "more
involved."</LD>
<LD>   Those assurances were made a few weeks after statements in January
by Disney President Robert Iger to the effect that the team was still
on the market.</LD>
<LD>   Iger had said that Disney would be open to selling the Ducks and
the Angels, provided the buyer would keep both franchises in Anaheim.
Iger made it clear that Disney officials saw no future in keeping the
teams.</LD>
<TE>   "Long-term, I'm not sure there's great synergy value or brand
value" in owning professional teams, Iger had said at the Salomon
Smith Barney Entertainment, Media and Telecommunications conference.
"If someone stepped up and offered the right price, we'd be willing
to sell."</TE>
<TE>   John Dreyer, a spokesman for Disney, said that Iger's statement
was not a shift in position for the company. He also said that having
teams perpetually on the market would not affect the day-to-day
operations or plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We have similar commitments to both teams and to Anaheim," Dreyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials may become even more committed to beefing up the
Ducks. As with any fixer-upper, improvements increase the chances of
a sale.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Timo Parssinen has worked at learning the North
American game and those efforts have brought him back to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Parssinen, who played in Finland, was recalled from minor league
Cincinnati after Marty McInnis was traded to Boston on March 5.</TE>
<TE>   It is his fourth tour of duty with the Ducks and he has
established himself ... somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a character guy and went down and played hard," Coach Bryan
Murray said. "He has become a guy we know can play in this league and
be an adequate player. He'll play in the NHL. I'm not saying he will
be playing for us, but he will be an NHL player."</TE>

<LD>The draw: The tournament committee's decision to reconfigure the
first- and second-round sites to ease travel concerns has paid
immediate dividends for Maryland, a bit perturbed last year when it
had to go through Boise, Idaho, and then Anaheim to win the West.
This year, Maryland enjoys its first-ever No. 1 seeding and opens at
Washington's MCI Center, a stone-crab's throw from home. Maryland
should be Beast of the East in this draw and we can't see a bump on
the road until a possible regional semifinal matchup against
Kentucky. The rest of the draw features a parade of star coaches as
five of the 16 coaches in play here have won Division I national
titles: Bob Knight, Jim Harrick, Jim Calhoun, Tubby Smith and Tom
Izzo.</LD>
<LD>   Best first-round game: Texas Tech vs. Southern Illinois. Imagine
the half-time speech possibilities: Bob Knight: "I came all the ...
way to Chicago and we're losing to the Salukis?" Actually, Southern
Illinois is capable of an upset, having already this season defeated
Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   Sleeper: Michigan State. After advancing to three consecutive
Final Fours and winning the national title in 2000, the Spartans seem
oddly out of place with their No. 10 seeding. Yet, if you think
defense and rebounding are keys to NCAA success, Michigan State is
capable of a mild first-round upset of North Carolina State and might
even scare Connecticut should the Huskies survive Hampton.</LD>
<TE>   Upset in the making: Take your pick of possible giant-slayers
here, No. 15 Hampton over No. 2 Connecticut or No. 13 Valparaiso over
No. 4 Kentucky. Hampton, of course, pulled off last year's biggest
upset in knocking off No. 2 Iowa State, while most contend this is
Valparaiso's best team since the 1998 squad that advanced to the
Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   Impact coach: Texas Tech's Bob Knight. Love him, hate him, make a
bad cable movie about him, Knight cannot be ignored. Texas Tech's
turnaround was one of college basketball's best stories this season,
but there may be plenty of drama left to be played out. Knight hasn't
coached a team to the Sweet 16 since Indiana in 1994, but his Red
Raiders have a good chance to win two games in Chicago and put Knight
on a higher pedestal.</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Maryland's Juan Dixon. He's the kind of
tough-as-nails guard you need to make deep tournament runs. Not only
is he the only Division I player in history with 2,000 points, 300
steals and 200 three-pointers, the senior shooting guard also shoots
90.7% from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Maryland. The Terrapins have the talent to tiptoe
through a less-than-enthralling bracket and get to start off with
essentially home-court advantage. Maryland should have a relatively
free ride until the regional finals, where a possible matchup against
Connecticut awaits, yet the Terrapins have a much easier road to the
Final Four this year than they did last season.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Hamilton Is Ready to Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Hamilton thinks he knows the answer.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Galaxy's new vice president and general manager,
it's all about kissing babies and shaking hands.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton is the team's fourth general manager in seven Major
League Soccer seasons, and each of his three predecessors--Danny
Villanueva, Sergio Del Prado and Tim Luce--struggled to find ways to
boost turnout at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   All three failed.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy has averaged 21,245 fans a game during the first six
years of its existence. The high came in 1996, when it attracted
28,918 to the Arroyo Seco. The low was in 2001, when only 17,387 made
the trip to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 11 days before the team starts its seventh and final season
at the Rose Bowl before moving into its new 27,000-seat home at
Carson, the Galaxy is trying to increase attendance by at least 15%
this season.</TE>
<TE>   That's Hamilton's job. A former soccer player at North Carolina
Greensboro who went on to become coach at Greensboro College and
later an assistant at Duke, he joined the Galaxy in mid-January after
the demise of the Miami Fusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just open up the doors and expect people to come,"
Hamilton said. "We have a very clear picture of our target market.
It's those people who are already financially and emotionally
committed to the game. I don't think it's our duty to try to sell the
game at this point to other [non-soccer] people. Eventually, that
will happen, and we have to take every opportunity we can to convert
people."</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, the Galaxy will try to reach soccer fans "who
don't know enough about us, don't follow us, don't go to our games
and don't have any understanding of what we hope to be in this
market."</TE>
<TE>   What the Galaxy hopes to be, in the long term, and especially once
its own stadium is in place, is a team recognized worldwide. Perhaps
not in the same sense as Bayern Munich or Real Madrid or Liverpool,
but recognized nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   That means becoming an even better team and playing international
teams regularly outside MLS play.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, we have a responsibility to the Southern
California soccer community to be a resource for them. That's a
responsibility we take very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   First, though, the Galaxy has to get the attention of the fans who
turn out in the tens of thousands to see, say, Chivas of Guadalajara
or Club America of Mexico City or Comunicaciones of Guatemala or El
Firpo of El Salvador, when they play in Los Angeles, but who so far
have largely resisted the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "In a market this sophisticated, with this much access to the
global game at the highest level, you need players who are very
exciting," Hamilton said. "It's not enough in this market to win.
Winning isn't enough. It may be enough in other U.S. markets, but
here you have to do it with a flair and an excitement and a passion
and a skill level that's the best this country has to offer at this
time."</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters is the fact that, unlike baseball,
basketball, football and hockey, which have the field to themselves,
American soccer faces global competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Any one of us on any day can find our favorite [soccer] team,
club, country somewhere on satellite and watch them, for pretty much
the cost of admission to one of our games," Hamilton said. "And we
can do that in the comfort of our own home.</TE>
<TE>   FC Barcelona--and all the other top clubs worldwide--are the
Galaxy's competition. Rivaldo is a better draw on TV than, say, Cobi
Jones is in person.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way to overcome that," Hamilton said. "It has
to be with the quality of play and it has to be with game-day
environment. We have to convince people that we're a part of their
soccer lives."</TE>
<TE>   So the Galaxy will be reaching out to soccer fans of all ages and
all languages, everyone from fresh-faced AYSO youngsters to hardened
players in the Southland's hundreds of ethnic-league teams who have
been largely ignored previously.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to talk to soccer people about soccer," Hamilton said.
"That includes everybody from soccer moms to little kids playing in
leagues to people who pay $20 to go in a crowded bar to watch their
country play during World Cup qualifying. It's a pretty broad market
for us to get to....</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to run this like a political campaign. We're going to
go out and shake hands and kiss babies. We're going to become a part
of their soccer lives."</TE>

<LD>It hasn't taken long for Coach Andy Murray to get his word across to
players he thought were struggling to get their game back after the
Olympic break.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Murray benched Steve Heinze for a game because he
thought the right wing was pressing too much.</LD>
<LD>   Murray was ready to do the same to Bryan Smolinski but before
benching the veteran center, Murray decided to have a talk with him
first.</LD>
<TE>   "I would say that his game hasn't been that bad but it hasn't been
good enough for a guy who needs to be an impact player for us," said
Murray, who had a one-on-one discussion with Smolinski on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski, who hasn't scored a goal since Jan. 17, opened Monday's
game against Chicago skating on a line with Ziggy Palffy and Heinze.
Murray said he decided to give Smolinski--who finished Monday night's
game without a goal or an assist--another chance after their talk.
"Bryan indicated to me that he preferred not to have that option used
on him," said Murray, who wants Smolinski to be more responsible on
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's totally aware now. He appreciates the fact that I'm sticking
with him and giving him an opportunity. I told him that I think he's
the key to our team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran left wing Kelly Buchberger, who suffered a severe ankle
sprain on Saturday at Colorado, was not in the lineup Monday and had
his consecutive-game streak end at 243.</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger, 35, was placed on the injured reserve list and is
listed as week-to-week. The last time Buchberger missed a game was
March 15, 1999 as a member of the Edmonton Oilers.</TE>

<LD>The draw: The Final Four contenders before the season began looked
like Illinois and Florida. But make way for Kansas--deposed by Duke
as the nation's No. 1 team Monday after losing to Oklahoma in the Big
12 final--and for Oregon, not even a top-40 team before the season.
It's hard to see anyone stopping either from reaching the regional
final, but the intrigue in the bracket is a potential
Florida-Illinois second-round game Sunday in Chicago--probably for
the right to play Kansas. Illinois made a nice late-season recovery
and Frank Williams is often brilliant late in games.</LD>
<LD>   Best first-round game: Stanford-Western Kentucky is a rare
first-round contest between ranked teams: No. 24-ranked Stanford
(19-9) is the eighth-seeded team, but ninth-seeded Western Kentucky
(28-3) is ranked No. 19. It's also a head-to-head matchup of two of
the nation's most skilled 7-footers--Curtis Borchardt and Chris
Marcus.</LD>
<LD>   Sleeper: Mississippi State. The Bulldogs were under the radar for
most of the season because of an early blowout loss to Cincinnati,
but won the Southeastern Conference tournament over Alabama and
defeated all the good SEC teams at least once. Cautionary note:
Mississippi State would have to play hometown favorite Texas at
Dallas in the second round if Boston College can't upset the
Longhorns.</LD>
<TE>   Upset in the making: Pepperdine over Wake Forest. The Demon
Deacons were a first-round victim of Butler last season, so the Waves
could strike a blow for the left-out mid-majors by upending the
Atlantic Coast Conference team Thursday at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Impact coach: Roy Williams. He has guided Kansas to a No. 1
seeding five times in 14 seasons and made the Final Four twice, in
1991 and '93 (But neither time as a No. 1). The only coaches in the
field with better NCAA tournament winning percentages than Williams
(67.6%) are Mike Krzyzewski (80%) and Tubby Smith (72%).</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Drew Gooden. The 6-10 junior forward for Kansas
averages 20 points and 11 rebounds and probably will finish second to
Duke's Jason Williams in the Wooden Award balloting. Keep an eye on
his excellent hands--one of several keys to his rebounding ability.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oregon. Kansas meets its mismatch in a regional final
between the two best running teams in the country. It will be bombs
away too: Oregon is No. 1 in the nation in three-point shooting, and
Kansas is No. 3. The problem for the Jayhawks is perimeter
mismatches. The small Kansas guards won't be able to shoot over
Oregon's wings, and 6-3 Kirk Hinrich--the tallest player in a
three-guard attack--will be hard pressed to defend 6-7 Luke Jackson.
And somebody still has to stop Frederick Jones, who plays like a
smaller Vince Carter, and Luke Ridnour, the Oregon point guard who
would be the epitome of a classic Jayhawk guard.</TE>

<HD>Losing Season Costs Florida State's Robinson a Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Robinson was fired Monday after coaching Florida State to four
straight losing seasons--and one big upset victory.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson was 64-86 in five years at Florida State, but only 46-72
over the last four seasons and 25-55 in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.</LD>
<LD>   "We haven't won a lot of games and that's why we're here today,"
Athletic Director David Hart Jr. said.</LD>
<TE>   "We just couldn't turn the corner competitively."</TE>
<TE>   Hart said he had expected a breakout year for the Seminoles but,
"We're still trying to learn how to win. It's nobody's fault, it just
didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 44, had two years left on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   Hart said Robinson would be paid $250,000 to cover the remaining
two years on his base salary and that he would immediately begin
looking for a new coach.</TE>
<TE>   Possible successors include Richmond Coach John Beilein, Tennessee
Tech's Jeff Lebo, Davidson's Bob McKillop, Western Kentucky's Dennis
Felton, Winthrop's Gregg Marshall, Hampton's Steve Merfeld and
Florida assistant John Pelfrey.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State scored arguably the biggest upset of the season when
it ended Duke's 22-game winning streak with a 77-76 victory on Jan.
6, but went 4-12 after that game, finishing at 12-17.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murry Bartow resigned as coach at Alabama Birmingham after failing
to lead the Blazers to the postseason for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Bartow, who succeeded his father, Gene, as head coach, had a
103-83 record in six seasons. He was 44-45 the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   UAB is coming off the worst season in its 24-year history, going
13-17 and losing in the first round of the Conference USA tournament.
It was only the second losing season for the Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach had some injuries the last couple of years," Athletic
Director Herman Frazier said. "It's been somewhat of a struggle for
him in following in his father's footsteps here at UAB."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Bartow became the program's first coach and athletic director
in 1977, guiding the Blazers to seven straight NCAA tournaments in
his first nine years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duke moved back into the No. 1 spot in the AP men's poll, a record
fourth straight year the Blue Devils were on top of the final
rankings of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Duke (29-3), which won the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
Sunday with a 91-61 victory over North Carolina State, had been tied
with UCLA for the most consecutive years as the final No. 1. The
Bruins' run was 1971-73.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sixth final regular-season No. 1 ranking for Duke,
leaving it one behind UCLA and Kentucky for most ever.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils received 58 first-place votes and 1,759 points
from the national media panel to easily outdistance runner-up Kansas
(29-3), which had been No. 1 the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Seven schools--UCLA, Missouri, Iowa, St. Joseph's, Virginia,
Boston College and Syracuse--were ranked in the top 10 at some point
this season but weren't in the final poll.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for the NCAA tournament selection show and three of four
conference championship games produced significant increases over
last year for CBS.</TE>
<TE>   The selection show earned an overnight rating of 5.8 and a share
of 11, up 5% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for the Conference USA, Pac-10 and Southeastern Conference
title games also were higher.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prairie View A&amp;M dismissed coach Elwood Plummer. In 18 seasons at
Prairie View, Plummer's record was 153-377.... Coach Tubby Smith said
Kentucky guard Gerald Fitch did not play during a first-round loss in
the Southeastern Conference tournament because of a curfew violation.
After Kentucky's 70-57 loss to South Carolina on Friday, Smith said
it was a coach's decision.... Kansas, Gonzaga, Stanford and
California will make up the field at the sixth annual Pete Newell
Challenge, to be held Dec. 28 at Oakland.</TE>

<LD>Not too long ago, it was considered a rarity for an athlete to play
in 1,000 NHL games. Because of the brutality of the sport, few hockey
players reached this milestone.</LD>
<LD>   That's not the case any more.</LD>
<LD>   Already this season, 13 players have joined the 176-member
1,000-game club, and there's a chance two more will do so before the
playoffs begin next month.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings' Kelly Buchberger, Nashville's Cliff Ronning, Phoenix's
Teppo Numminen, Pittsburgh's Stephane Richer, Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk,
Tampa Bay's Grant Ledyard, San Jose's Adam Graves, Calgary's Dave
Lowry, the New York Rangers' Theo Fleury and Brian Leetch and
Colorado's Mike Keane, Todd Gill and Joe Sakic have achieved this
mark since October.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia's Mark Recchi (994 as of Sunday) and Calgary's Craig
Berube (982) are on pace to join them before the regular season ends
next month with Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick (971) leading a pack of
others primed to reach the mark next season.</TE>
<TE>   And the funny thing about most of these so-called "old-timers" is
that none seem prepared to quit soon.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at athletics in general, athletes are producing at an
older age in all sports," said Washington center Adam Oates, who will
turn 40 in August and leads the league in assists this season.</TE>
<TE>   "[Compared to] when I came into this league ... guys really treat
this sport differently. It is more of a 12-month sport and guys train
a lot differently, and myself included. I train 10 times harder now
than I used to when I first came into this league. And I think for
the most part ... everybody does."</TE>
<TE>   After playing in his 1,000th game earlier this season, Buchberger
said he's part of a generation of players who simply enjoy playing
hockey. He should know because when he played for Moose Jaw as a
junior from 1984 to '86, two of his minor league teammates were
Fleury and Keane.</TE>
<TE>   Staying physically sound enough has also been a key. Players are
able to bounce back from injuries thanks to improved medical
technology and better all-around conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think playing the games is the easy part because we all love to
play them," said Oates, who has played in 1,192 games. "The hard part
is the training in the summer. The off-season conditioning is
actually the hard part every year. Knowing that you have got to force
yourself to get there and stay in condition."</TE>
<TE>   Size Doesn't Matter</TE>
<TE>   One of the most unlikely players to play in 1,000 games is the
5-foot-8, 165-pound Ronning, who joined Sakic to become the latest
players to reach the mark Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his lack of size, Ronning has been regarded as one of the
league's toughest players for years. He's the Predators' all-time
leader in goals (80), assists (144), points (224), power-play goals
(24), power-play points (95) and shots (877).</TE>
<TE>   "He was my roommate for three years in Phoenix and probably one of
the true freaks of nature that there are in sports today," Roenick
said about Ronning. "How you can have a guy who is 5-6, 5-7 or
whatever he is and dominate a hockey game like he does?</TE>
<TE>   "He's tremendously skilled. He's tremendously poised for being a
little guy, and he is very, very, very smart in terms of knowing
where to be and where the puck needs to be at the right time. Not to
mention you can't catch him."</TE>
<TE>   Speeding Up the Game</TE>
<TE>   Reaction around the league was mixed after general managers
decided to approve further exploration of three on-ice rules at their
annual March meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at a whole host of ways of moving the game along as
quickly as we can," Commissioner Gary Bettman said. "There are three
things that we came out of the meeting wanting to pursue. One is
hurry-up line changes/faceoffs, one is not allowing a defending
player to use his stick or his free hand in the neutral zone to
obstruct an offensive player who is not carrying the puck, and the
other was a modified 'tag-up' rule. We want to pursue implementation
of all three elements, but to do that we have to make sure we define
them in a way that works."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL's hockey operations department will refine definitions of
the "hurry-up faceoff," the "tag-up" offside rule and the standard of
enforcement regarding obstruction, and then present the changes at a
Board of Governors meeting in June.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the league will decide if any of the rules will be
implemented for play next season.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we make changes, we've got to be comfortable with [them],"
San Jose General Manager Dean Lombardi said after last week's
meetings. "I don't think there's a whole lot wrong with the game
we've got right now and you don't want to jump into anything."</TE>
<TE>   A big concern is that the league might try to make changes based
on the success of the hockey competition at last month's Salt Lake
City Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to decide whether our goal is to get people out of the
rink faster or are we trying to increase the flow of the game?"
Lombardi said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to do right now is look at the possibilities and
then make an [informed] decision. We don't want to keep revisiting
these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * The odds of Calgary making a late run to qualify for the
playoffs may be long, but the chances of Flame winger Jarome Iginla
holding on to win the league's scoring title have greatly improved
since the Olympic break. With 16 games remaining in the regular
season, Iginla has opened up some breathing room in the race for
points and goals. Iginla, who will be a restricted free agent after
this season, has said that he wants to remain in Calgary, but the
Flames are expected to open negotiations at around $4 million per
season. Word around the league has Iginla looking for a long-term
deal worth at least $6 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Edmonton is another Canadian team hoping to get hot down the
stretch and Oiler General Manager Kevin Lowe is looking to make a
deal before the league's March 19 trading deadline. The Oilers have
been offering Tom Poti as a trade candidate.</TE>
<TE>   * Dallas owner Tom Hicks is known as someone not afraid to pay big
money for a player (note: Texas Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez and
his $25-million-a-year contract), but that doesn't mean he's ready to
make a deal for Florida's Pavel Bure and his $10-million-a-year
contract.</TE>
<TE>   As long as Pittsburgh General Manager Craig Patrick believes that
the Penguins have a chance to make the playoffs, don't look for the
team to trade Darius Kasparaitis or Robert Lang. But that could
change, considering that both players will be unrestricted free
agents this summer.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As far as Colorado Coach Bob Hartley is concerned, the race for the
Vezina Trophy is over. Patrick Roy is his choice.</LD>
<LD>   Roy turned aside 33 shots as the Avalanche beat the St. Louis
Blues, 3-2, Monday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   "If he doesn't win it, I don't know who will," Hartley said of the
award given each season to the NHL's top goalie. "The ones who watch
Patrick on a regular basis since the start of this season, they know
what kind of season he's having."</LD>
<TE>   Colorado has won six consecutive road games. It was the first road
game for the Avalanche since Feb. 8. St. Louis has not won since the
Olympic break (0-5-2).</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 2, Montreal 1--Sandy McCarthy scored with 45.5
seconds left to give the Rangers a win at New York. McCarthy, playing
on the top line in place of injured center Eric Lindros, lost the
puck at the blue line, but Theo Fleury saved it. McCarthy scored on a
wraparound.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 4, Pittsburgh 2--Ray Whitney and Mike Sillinger each
scored twice at Pittsburgh. Jean Francois Labbe, starting his first
NHL game in two years, stopped 34 shots for the first win of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Calgary 3--Craig Conroy scored his second goal with
1:19 left in regulation as the Flames salvaged a tie at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta forward Ilya Kovalchuk, the leading goal scorer among
rookies, will sit out the rest of the season because of a dislocated
right shoulder.</TE>

<HD>No One Looking Past Songaila</HD>
<DH>Midwest Regional: Pepperdine prepares for 6-9 Wake Forest
star, a member of Lithuanian team who ranks among ACC leaders in
seven categories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darius Songaila describes himself as "a nice guy" in his profile in
the Wake Forest basketball media guide.</LD>
<LD>   Right. So what prompted Virginia Coach Pete Gillen to call
Songaila "a mangler who kills innocent bystanders in the post" after
the Demon Deacon forward bullied the Cavaliers for 27 points in a
game last season?</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine will discover the answer Thursday, when it encounters
the bashing, bruising Songaila, a member of the Lithuanian national
team, in a first-round game of the NCAA tournament's Midwest Regional
at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Though the 6-foot-9, 248-pound senior is overshadowed by other big
men in the Atlantic Coast Conference, namely Duke's Carlos Boozer and
Maryland's Lonny Baxter, Songaila is no secret to Wake Forest's
opponents. He ranks among ACC leaders in scoring, rebounding,
field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, assists, steals and
blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Songaila's style of play that has earned him the most
notice. He doesn't shy away from contact and has provided
seventh-seeded Wake Forest (20-12) with a steady, durable enforcer
during his four seasons as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a gladiator," said Skip Prosser, the Demon Deacons'
first-year coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives our guys courage, and I think that's maybe his biggest
contribution."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (22-8), seeded 10th in the regional, already seemed
aware of Wake Forest's front-line muscle when the pairings were
announced Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they have some strong inside play," said Cedric Suitt, the
Waves' 6-11 center. "I'm going to have to pick up my defense that
much more."</TE>
<TE>   Songaila (pronounced sun-GUY-la) leads Wake Forest with averages
of 17.8 points and 8.1 rebounds and is shooting 52.5% from the field.
He is arguably the Demon Deacons' best player since Tim Duncan and
ranks second to the San Antonio Spur forward in career starts with
118.</TE>
<TE>   Adept at using either hand around the basket, Songaila is a
skilled post player who can make medium-range jump shots. He is
nearly automatic from the foul line, making 85.4% of his free throws,
and ranks third on the team with 86 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "He's selfless," Prosser said. "He makes everyone else better
because teams really distort [their defenses] toward him. He's
willing to pass the ball, and he cares about winning."</TE>
<TE>   Songaila has demonstrated that quality since he began playing
basketball as a boy in his native Lithuania. He grew up in
Marijampole, a city of 65,000 located about two hours from the
capital of Vilnius, and quickly established himself among his
country's top talents with his play on the junior national team.</TE>
<TE>   He realized a dream when he was selected to play on the national
team for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Playing with former Portland
Trail Blazer center Arvydas Sabonis, Songaila helped Lithuania win
the bronze medal and throw two scares into the U.S. "Dream Team" of
NBA stars, including an 85-83 semifinal loss.</TE>
<TE>   Songaila found his way to Tobacco Road after playing one season
for New Hampton Prep in New Hampshire in 1997-98. He received an
offer to play at the prestigious prep school after Lane Odom, son of
former Wake Forest coach Dave Odom, saw Songaila play with the junior
national team in Lithuania.</TE>
<TE>   He battled foul trouble early in his career at Wake Forest,
fouling out of eight games as a freshman and five games as a
sophomore, but since has reduced the calls against him. This season
has been his most enjoyable, and he's looking forward to graduating
and getting married this spring. He is engaged to former Wake Forest
tennis player Jackie Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad this is the year that it all came together," said
Songaila, who was selected to the All-ACC second team.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest's Lithuanian connection will continue after this
season with Vytas Danelius, a 6-8 freshman who has relied on Songaila
for guidance and support.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his countryman's roughneck reputation, Danelius says he
knows the real Songaila.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all," he said, "he is a nice guy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine and Wake Forest each have played eight teams in the
NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves went 3-7, beating UCLA, USC and Gonzaga and losing to
Utah, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Georgia, Arizona and Gonzaga twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons were 4-8 against tournament teams, beating North
Carolina Wilmington, Marquette and North Carolina State twice and
losing to Kansas, St. John's, Cincinnati, Maryland twice and Duke
three times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's scheduled practice at Arco Arena will be from noon to
12:50 p.m. Wednesday and is open to the public.</TE>

<DL>DAYTON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>For the second consecutive year, the NCAA has its two lowest seeds
playing for the 64th spot in the tournament as Siena takes on Alcorn
State tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The winner will catch a flight to Washington to play No. 1
Maryland on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The play-in format returned last season when the number of
automatic bids expanded.</LD>
<TE>   Siena (16-18) won four games in four days on its home floor to get
the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference's automatic bid. The Saints
are the 16th team to make the NCAA tournament with a losing record.</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn State (21-9), which won the regular-season and tournament
championships in the Southwestern Athletic Conference, has already
won a couple of NCAA play-in games in Dayton, beating Xavier in 1983
and Houston Baptist a year later.</TE>
<TE>   "I won both of those games on this floor," said 26th-year Coach
Dave Whitney. "I'm hoping that this floor will be just as good to
us."</TE>

<HD>Close-Knit Wilson Is Serving Early Notice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scouting report on Hacienda Heights Wilson High was simple. It
was also dead-on: Well-rounded, with solid pitching and catching.</LD>
<LD>   The Wildcats opened their season at the San Dimas tournament and
walked away with the championship, beating Rancho Cucamonga, 3-0, in
the final Saturday, and this week find themselves ranked No. 2 by The
Times.</LD>
<LD>   Pitcher Jamee Juarez began the season with a three-hitter,
two-hitter and one-hitter, and during the tournament, she struck out
43 in 28 innings--15 against Rancho Cucamonga.</LD>
<TE>   There has been a new hero on offense every game. Yvette Pena had
two runs batted in, providing the game-winning runs in a 4-1 victory
over West Covina; Jenny Chacon and Juarez each had two RBIs in a 10-4
victory over West Covina; Jessica DeGiacomo drove in the winning run
in the fifth inning of a 3-0 victory over Rowland, and Iris Gonzalez
knocked in the winning run in the seventh inning in a 1-0 victory
over Pomona Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is one team that can spread the wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's made some big contributions," Coach Walt Martin said.
"Even our 9-10-11 players, who are alternating playing time, are
doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who coached baseball nearly 30 years at Wilson and is in
his 11th season with the softball team, admits he already has a soft
spot for this group.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a special team," said Martin, who guided Wilson to the
Southern Section Division III title in 2000. "Of the 11 girls, four
are seniors, and they're neat kids. Whatever we ask them to do--pick
up rocks, pick up paper, rake the field--they do it. I think maybe
that's unusual for a team. You always hear a little bit of grumbling,
but these [players] have a good work ethic....</TE>
<TE>   "They're all kind of best friends. They stick up for each other
wherever they are, on campus, in the community, at games."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson should be better than last season's team. Second baseman
Tiffanie Wedell, one of four seniors, has recovered from a knee
injury that hobbled her most of last season, and senior center
fielder Annette Zamarripa has played a valuable leadership role.</TE>
<TE>   It's a collection of players that could be destined to repeat the
title the school won two years ago. At least Martin likes to think
so.</TE>
<TE>   "We have good athletes ... and they can all play," he said. "And
they get along with each other. At times, I think, they get along
with each other too well. It's fun to be around."</TE>
<TE>   Bring it on: Foothill opened the season ranked No. 1 by The Times
and No. 2 in the state. Along with some of the other top teams in the
country, Foothill begins play Thursday in the Ramada Express Best of
the West tournament at Bullhead City, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill has shown its mettle in the early going. The Knights
defeated Fresno Bullard, 17-0, in their opener, and followed with a
doubleheader sweep of Clovis the next day. Bullard was ranked No. 4
in the state and Clovis was No. 5. The top-ranked team in the state
is Fairfield.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Foothill played host to Lakewood, also in The
Times' top 25, and won, 3-1 and 6-0, behind two new pitchers, senior
Alison Yin, a transfer from Pasadena Westridge, and freshman Lori
Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   In its first three games, Foothill scored 15 runs in its final
at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "Our history is that we never score at the end," Coach Joe
Gonzalez said. "We get ahead, and then play really good defense. But
it's been an explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Explosions, implosions: Matching Foothill in the good start
department is Newhall Hart, which is in a rebuilding year but opened
its season by winning its own tournament. Unranked in the preseason,
Hart debuts at No. 6 in this week's Times' rankings after beating
Whittier California.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Esperanza dropped from fifth to 24th after losing its
first three games--to No. 23 Capistrano Valley, No. 8 Anaheim Canyon
and Dana Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly what was expected of the team that played for last
season's Southern Section Division I championship.</TE>

<LD>Noah Bryant's shoulders are thicker than a watermelon. If one of his
friends at Carpinteria High needed someone to lift a car, he'd gladly
oblige.</LD>
<LD>   He's 6 feet 1, 275 pounds, bench presses 430 pounds and is the
state's top high school shotputter, with a best effort of 63 feet
83/4 inches.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant's older brother, Josh, is a freshman at Louisiana State.
He's a competitive power lifter who benches 573 pounds. Father Dan, a
former thrower at Westmont College, is 52, weighs 300 pounds and
benches 400 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant's mother, Susan, is only 5-1 and never afraid to ask for
help from one of the herculean men around the house.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll move heavy things for me, but no one seems to be able to
pick up a sock," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner at the Bryant house is similar to a banquet for Sumo
wrestlers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to watch your fingers," Susan said. "Anything that
doesn't move might get eaten. We don't have a lot of leftovers."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was on his way to becoming an outstanding offensive
lineman. He was an All-Southern Section football honoree as a junior
at Carpinteria. Then, two weeks before two-a-days last summer, Bryant
told his coaches he would pass up his senior football season to
concentrate on track.</TE>
<TE>   He agonized over his decision for weeks, not so much based on
whether he'd receive a scholarship in football. He felt training full
time for the shotput would help him fulfill his track potential.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the hardest decision I ever made," he said. "Track is what
I love to do. It's just something inside of me. It's what I'm here
for."</TE>
<TE>   His father turned the garage into a weight room. Six days a week
in the fall, Bryant would lift weights and work out with his private
coach, John Amneus. He didn't arrive until halftime of most home
football games because of his training schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Loud music could be heard from the garage, where Bryant used
blasts from Guns N' Roses and Van Halen to inspire his lifting
exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant finished third in the shotput at last year's state meet at
61-111/2 His training has been going so well that reaching 70 feet
this season is not improbable. He has thrown 65-4 in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very intense individual," Carpinteria Coach Van Latham
said. "Any time you give him a challenge, 'Oh, come on, you can't do
that,' it sets him off."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is convinced he's going to break the 70-foot barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the way my training has been going, that I want to do it so
bad that I'm going to do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Bryant toss a 12-pound ball is entertaining. He reaches
an emotional crescendo, then lets out a loud grunt while releasing
it.</TE>
<TE>   "On my big throws, I'll have adrenaline pumping before I go in,"
he said. "Something clicks inside me. I start grunting and getting
mean."</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant walks around campus, buildings don't shake, but he can
be an intimidating sight.</TE>
<TE>   "If [students] didn't know me, they'd probably get out of the
way," he said. "But I'm not a mean guy."</TE>
<TE>   Just don't encourage the Bryant brothers to wrestle at home.
That's a certain way to break things, like a coffee table.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my brother used to fight a little bit," Bryant said. "Any
time he wanted to, he'd beat me up. Toward the end, we were pretty
even in wrestling."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky, Arizona, UCLA, USC and Missouri are the schools Bryant
is considering for college.</TE>
<TE>   When coaches come to the Bryant home for a recruiting visit, they
should beware of chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my dad have broken three or four chairs," Noah said.
"They're in the basement."</TE>
<TE>   The chairs were broken not in some wrestling demonstration. They
were shattered simply by a Bryant sitting in them.</TE>
<TE>   These are big men with big dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "Noah's goal is to be in the Olympics some day," his father said.</TE>
<TE>   Noah never rests until his goals are attained.</TE>

<LD>The draw: If the West Regional is the bracket of champions, the South
landed some top runners-up. The second through fourth seeds all lost
in the finals of conference tournaments: Alabama (Southeastern),
Pittsburgh (Big East) and USC (Pacific 10). The No. 1 seed, Duke, is
a champion in every sense of the word. The Blue Devils are back to
defend their NCAA title and just rolled to the ACC tournament crown.</LD>
<LD>   Best first-round game: No. 5-seeded Indiana vs. No. 12 Utah. It's
Big Ten player of the year Jared Jeffries and a Bob Knight-influenced
system against the tactics of Rick Majerus. Utah's coach is great
under tournament conditions, with quick turnarounds, and now he gets
three days of preparation. In February, the Utes had to clear out of
their dorms to make room for the Winter Olympic athletes. Now they'll
be much closer to home (in Sacramento) than Indiana will be.</LD>
<LD>   Sleeper: USC. If the Trojans can somehow get past Duke--or get
someone else to do the dirty work for them--they could roll through
whomever emerges from the lower half of the draw. They're athletic
and tournament-tested after making it to the Elite Eight last season.</LD>
<TE>   Upset in the making: No. 10 Kent State vs. No. 7 Oklahoma State.
Kent State has won 18 consecutive games; the Cowboys have won only
eight of their last 18. If Oklahoma State's jump shots aren't falling
and the offense stops moving, it comes down to guards Maurice Baker
and Victor Williams trying to take their men off the dribble.
Middle-of-the-pack teams from the power conferences tend to overlook
mid-major conference champions. The Cowboys should check with the
Indiana Hoosiers, who lost to Kent State in the first round last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Impact coach: Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. He's always the impact
coach, no matter what the region. Nine Final Fours, three
championships. Enough said.</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Just like last year, it's a battle between Duke
teammates. Last time it was Jason Williams and Shane Battier. This
time it's Williams and Mike Dunleavy Jr. Dunleavy can drain
three-pointers, make athletic plays around the hoop, get into the
passing lanes on defense and create steals. When he's on, Duke is
almost invincible. But Williams is the one who makes it happen, with
his quick-release shot and his ability to get to the basket. The
status of Pittsburgh point guard Brandin Knight's sprained knee will
determine how far the third-seeded Panthers advance in the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Duke. With projected opponents Notre Dame, USC and
Alabama, the path to the Final Four won't be easy. But the Blue
Devils have all the ingredients for another championship run: size
(Carlos Boozer), athleticism (Dunleavy, Chris Duhon, Dahntay Jones)
and a great lead guard (Williams).</TE>

<LD>No introductions will be necessary when Jason Kapono of UCLA and
Justin Reed of Mississippi take the floor in the first round of the
NCAA tournament Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The off-season basketball circuit often forges unlikely
acquaintances, such as a Bruin junior and a Rebel sophomore. They
trained together in Colorado Springs, Colo., last summer and played
on separate national teams.</LD>
<LD>   Kapono made what was considered the more prestigious team, which
played in the World Championship for Young Men in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Reed made the team that played in the World University Games in
China. Mississippi Coach Rod Barnes was an assistant on that team.</TE>
<TE>   Although Reed did not believe he played to his potential during
tryouts, he came to a realization that has made him a better player.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing I talked about with Coach Barnes, developing
some more outside skills," Reed said. "Last year, we didn't have a
lot of size, so I had to play underneath the basket. I believed
adding a jump shot and developing my ballhandling skills will help my
game."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono remembers the 6-foot-8, 230-pound Reed as a versatile power
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good player, a very good player," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing in Pittsburgh will be a homecoming of sorts for first-year
UCLA assistant Patrick Sandle. He coached under Ben Howland at Pitt
the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It will feel like going home," Sandle said. "I'm looking forward
to it."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he got the same feeling when UCLA Coach Steve Lavin
hired him. Sandle, 38, was a star guard at Crenshaw High, helping the
team to the City Section championship in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Sandle became a coach shortly after completing his eligibility at
San Francisco State and was an assistant as St. Mary's, Fresno State,
Sonoma State and three junior colleges before Howland hired him at
Northern Arizona in 1996.</TE>

<LD>Loyola Marymount's men's basketball rebuilding plan appeared ahead of
schedule in December. The Lions, 9-19 last season, had won six games,
were over .500 and had a 15-point second-half lead over USC.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans went on a 39-9 run to end any hopes of an upset.
Second-year Coach Steve Aggers didn't figure on the impact that loss
could have. The Lions won only three more games, finished the season
with a 12-game losing streak and were still behind other West Coast
Conference teams in terms of talent.</LD>
<LD>   "Eighteen months ago, we inherited a program that was 2-26,"
Aggers said. "In your first year when you have a job, there's a lot
of excitement around the change. Anything you do is a positive."</LD>

<TE>   "We never could regain the form we showed in December," he said.
"As a result, our kids just lost confidence.... This group of kids
battled and fought and competed all season. We played the No. 6 team
in the country [Gonzaga] to a six-point game in the middle of the

<TE>   Cal State Long Beach (10-6) begins its Big West Conference
baseball schedule Thursday with a three-game series against UC
Riverside (15-7) after moving into Baseball America's top 25 with a
three-game sweep of Arizona. Coach Mike Weathers, who succeeded Dave

<LD>North Carolina Wilmington has held opponents to 60.3 points per game,
the 11th-best average in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   USC is averaging 77.6 points.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans insist they will do nothing out of the ordinary
Thursday when they encounter the Seahawk defense in a South Regional
game at Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to change the game up a little bit," USC Coach Henry
Bibby said after practice Monday. "But we're not going to change the
way we play. We're going to pick it up and make them play a little
faster and go from there."</TE>
<TE>   The 13th-seeded Seahawks were wondering why they were chosen to
fly cross-country in a year when the NCAA was making an effort to
keep teams closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little disappointed ... but there's nothing we can do
about that," said junior guard Brett Blizzard. Among other schools
forced to make long trips: California and UCLA to Pittsburgh, and
Wake Forest to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's bench may be getting longer for the later rounds of the NCAA
tournament as X-rays taken Monday of center Kostas Charissis' broken
left ankle showed enough improvement that the junior hopes to begin
working out early next week, if the Trojans are still alive and
playing in Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Wilmington, heading to only its second NCAA
tournament, is making its fourth postseason appearance in the last
five years.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, though, are 0-3, having lost, 66-52, to Wake Forest
in the 1998 National Invitation Tournament, to Cincinnati in the 2000
NCAAs, 64-47, and last year to Dayton in the NIT, 68-59.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The draw: The West is stacked not only with excellent teams, but with
excellent teams playing very well. Of the top seven seeded teams,
only Miami did not win its conference tournament. The bracket lacks a
Duke-Maryland-Kansas gorilla at the top, but No. 1 Cincinnati and No.
2 Oklahoma are so close, either could be considered a top seed. A
ho-hum first round could produce monster second-round matchups,
including Gonzaga-Arizona, Cincinnati-UCLA and Ohio State-Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   Best first-round game: Miami-Missouri. Neither team played well
down the stretch, but both are dangerous. Five Hurricane players
average at least 11 points and the Tigers have potent three-point
shooters in Clarence Gilbert, Ricky Paulding and Kareem Rush. Even if
the game is one-sided, Rush and 6-foot-10 Darius Rice of
Miami--cousin of NFL great Jerry Rice--undoubtedly will entertain.</LD>
<LD>   Sleeper: Missouri. The 12th-seeded Tigers were ranked No. 2 in the
nation early in the season after winning nine in a row with victories
over Alabama, Xavier and Iowa, but are 12-11 since. A near-upset of
Kansas in the regular-season finale and a 20-point win over Iowa
State in the first round of the Big 12 tournament offered glimpses of
their potential.</LD>
<TE>   Upset in the making: No. 10 Hawaii over No. 7 Xavier. Besides
Missouri's game against Miami, this is the best chance for a
lower-seeded team to win. Hawaii defeated Tulsa on its home court for
the Western Athletic Conference tournament title, stuck around for
Sunday's selection announcement and must travel only about 250 miles
to Dallas for its first-round matchup. Xavier has NBA prospect David
West and the Atlantic 10 tournament title, but its weak conference
and suspect nonconference schedule could spell a first-round exit.</TE>
<TE>   Impact coach: Lute Olson of Arizona. Yes, Gonzaga's Mark Few is
everybody's favored rising genius, but Olson proved in the Pac-10
tournament he is still the best coach in the Pacific time zone,
getting his outmanned roster to produce its best 20 minutes of the
conference tournament in the second half of the final against USC.
Arizona gained a No. 3 seeding with a team that played the nation's
toughest schedule and has six freshmen among its nine scholarship
players a year after losing four starters.</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Steve Logan of Cincinnati. Some say the two-time
Conference USA player of the year is more important to the Bearcats
than Jason Williams is to Duke. The only player in the West Regional
who can approach his value is Gonzaga guard Dan Dickau. Logan, who
can play either guard position, is a tremendous clutch shooter who
averages 22 points and has scored at least 30 five times.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Gonzaga. Back in the familiar role of believing they
have something to prove, the 'Zags will overcome Olson's coaching to
beat Arizona and Logan's shooting to beat Cincinnati, making their
first Final Four appearance.</TE>

<LD>A fire in a two-story office complex Sunday night caused at least
$800,000 in damage to 11 businesses, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The shell of the building, which smoldered into the early morning
Monday, was so unstable that fire investigators were unable to enter
it to determine the cause.</LD>
<LD>   It took about 100 firefighters nearly four hours to bring the
blaze under control. The flames were reported at 6:58 p.m. at 1012
Brioso Lane, in the southwest corner of the city.</LD>
<TE>   "The heat of this fire was extremely intense. Nobody could even
get in," said Capt. Kirk Dominic, a spokesman for the Costa Mesa Fire
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The walls of the structure were to be braced so investigators
could work inside. Arson investigators have also been asked to
inspect the building.</TE>

<HD>Audit Questions Graffiti Payments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles controller alleged Monday that the city overpaid for
graffiti removal by New Directions for Youth Inc., but another top
city official said the expenditures were justified.</LD>
<LD>   City Controller Laura Chick raised questions about the city's
anti-graffiti efforts at a time when the program is flush with money.
The City Council recently increased spending to contractors from $4.3
million to $7.8 million to counter the blight.</LD>
<LD>   New Directions for Youth Inc. is one of 17 nonprofit agencies that
share contracts administered by the city agency Operation Clean
Sweep. New Directions serves much of the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The audit found that New Directions was paid $459,333 in 1999 for
graffiti removal, which auditors said was at least $54,525 "in excess
of allocable expenses."</TE>
<TE>   The controller concluded that New Directions used an additional
$15,000 to buy two vans without the written approval of Operation
Clean Sweep.</TE>
<TE>   The audit recommends reimbursement and a review of billings for
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   But Delphia Jones, director of Operation Clean Sweep, and Ed
Viramontes, executive director of New Directions for Youth, said the
group justified all of its billings and obtained verbal approval from
the city to buy the vans.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just a difference of opinion," Viramontes said. "We are
going to fulfill the wishes of the city controller."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Chick, Jones said the compensation paid to New
Directions should stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be meeting very shortly to talk about the audit,"
Jones said Monday</TE>
<TE>   Chick said she stands by her recommendation that the city seek
reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   Chick's office concluded that New Directions for Youth hired an
accountant who assigned an estimated cost to volunteer labor.</TE>
<TE>   The audit said the approach "did not appear reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said in a letter that New Directions met the terms of its
contract by exceeding the square footage and cleanup guidelines, so
"the compensation authorized to them should be honored."</TE>
<TE>   Viramontes defended the billing in a letter to Chick.</TE>
<TE>   "Since NDY was in full compliance with the goal of maintaining a
graffiti-free environment in the assigned areas of the San Fernando
Valley, no excess funds were received," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said her agency has provided written confirmation that it
gave verbal authorization to New Directions to buy the vans.</TE>

<DH>Wildlife: Residents tell of losing pets to animals that
have followed prey out of dry hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents of hillside communities in and around Los Angeles have more
than bone-dry brush to fret about this winter as drought conditions
force coyotes to roam deeper into neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Rodents and rabbits are coming down into streets and yards looking
for food and water, officials say. And where the prey go, the coyotes
follow.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last year, the Los Angeles Department of Animal
Regulation has received an increasing number of complaints about
coyotes, including attacks on pets. That has prompted officials to
reconsider the city's policy on dealing with the animals.</LD>
<TE>   "They are losing their natural fear of man," said spokeswoman
Jackie David. "Coyotes are everywhere. People perceive them as a
threat to public safety. Our department is looking at ways to
dedicate more resources to keeping coyotes out of neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, about 100 people gathered at a Canoga Park
meeting of the Los Angeles Animal Services Commission, many to
complain about losing pets to coyotes. Some said they were afraid to
jog at night because of the animals.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a prisoner," said Malka Tasoff, a 17-year Tarzana resident.
"I'm a captive in my own home."</TE>
<TE>   But Leo Grillo, an animal rescuer, said that in 18 years he has
seen numerous coyotes and never considered them a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "The comments I'm hearing tonight are just superstition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is considering whether to assign two wildlife
specialists to handle coyote problems and create a program to educate
the public about the animals. Under the proposal, animal services
workers would trap and kill coyotes deemed an imminent threat to
people or pets.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Fish and Game does not count coyotes
because they are prolific and not endangered. Fish and Game officials
say they do not know whether the increasing number of complaints
indicates growth in the coyote population.</TE>
<TE>   Coyotes are intelligent animals that have adapted to living near
humans. They have adjusted to their shrinking habitat in the Los
Angeles area and use streets, parks, flood-control channels and
freeways to venture into neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The coyotes generally eat rats, mice, squirrels, fruit and
carrion. But having learned that domestic animals are easier prey,
coyotes also kill cats and small dogs. They also will attack
chickens, sheep and goats. "Pet owners beware," said Michael
Carpenter of Shadow Hills, who lost three chickens, a duck and a
peacock to coyotes two weeks ago. "They left nothing but feathers."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter, who is chief deputy for Los Angeles Councilman Dennis
Zine, said Zine's office also has received calls from residents
fearing for the safety of their children and pets. Patrick Kennedy of
West Hills was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said that about 4 a.m. two months ago a coyote nearly
killed his miniature pinscher in his backyard. Kennedy sprained his
ankle trying to wrest the pet from the coyote, which tore the tiny
dog's belly and throat.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically had to sew him up from the inside out," Kennedy
said of the $750 in veterinarian bills.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Kennedy has been circulating leaflets calling for a
tougher city policy on coyotes. City animal regulation officers trap
a coyote only if it is sick or injured or if it attacks a person and
is suspected of having rabies.</TE>
<TE>   The county, state and federal government can also require trapping
due to health and welfare risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see them treat coyotes like any other stray dog,"
Kennedy said. "They wouldn't hesitate to come out and take it away."</TE>
<TE>   Animal experts recommend the following to protect pets from
coyotes:</TE>
<TE>   * Keep cats and small dogs indoors at night.</TE>
<TE>   * Walk dogs on a leash in well-lighted areas.</TE>
<TE>   * Poultry and rabbits should be kept in enclosures of heavy mesh
wire, not chicken wire.</TE>
<TE>   * Fasten trash can lids securely.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not feed wild animals.</TE>

<HD>Area's Fight Against Liquor Sales Lives On</HD>
<DH>Pacoima: Community keeps activist's memory alive in its
efforts to block a permanent license for a market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 15 years, Efren Olvera Flores fought the granting of liquor
licenses to businesses in Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood already had enough places selling alcohol, he
felt.</LD>
<LD>   In January, he was waging a battle against the Superior Super
Warehouse market when he died of a heart attack at age 68.</LD>
<TE>   Community members recently held a candlelight vigil in front of
the market in Flores' memory, vowing to continue the fight.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not against Superior being here, but we're against them
selling alcohol in our neighborhood,'' said Maria Calleros, alcohol
project coordinator for Pueblo y Salud, a community group that is
part of the Pacoima Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Policy Coalition.
''We really feel we can't deal with another alcohol license in this
area.''</TE>
<TE>   Pacoima has long been plagued by alcohol-related crimes, and in
the last several years Flores helped to reduce the number of alcohol
outlets, Calleros said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're fighting Superior's license because we don't want the
number to go back up again,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Five stores in Superior's neighborhood sell liquor. If Superior is
granted a permanent liquor license, there will be six--two more than
state law allows, said Tim Clark, district administrator for the
state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.</TE>
<TE>   A state law passed in 1995 determines how many liquor licenses are
allowed in a specific geographical area, known as a census tract. The
number is determined in part by the area's population and crime rate.
Liquor licenses obtained before 1995 are not affected by the
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon for an area to exceed its liquor-license
allotment. ''It happens in lots of locations throughout the state,''
Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Superior opened its Pacoima store on Laurel Canyon Boulevard a
year ago without a liquor license. But in August, the Los Angeles
City Council decided the store could sell alcohol as a ''public
convenience or necessity.''</TE>
<TE>   Such a determination is required when the neighborhood is
considered a high-crime area with an undue concentration of liquor
outlets, Clark said. As a result, the alcoholic beverage control
agency granted the store an interim permit, good for 120 days.
Superior is on its second renewed temporary permit.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla, who represents Pacoima, was
instrumental in allowing Superior to get the temporary permit and
believes the store is beneficial to the community.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Superior market is in an area traditionally underserved by
grocery stores,'' said Padilla's spokesman, David Gershwin. ''It's a
real top-of-the-line grocery store.''</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Song, who owns the 13 Superior stores, said it's unfair to
expect a full-service grocery store to thrive without a liquor
license. ''I think beer and wine are for when families gather. We try
to provide that for the convenience of our customers,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   The store's request for a permanent liquor license will be
considered at hearings today through Thursday at the Van Nuys State
Building, 6150 Van Nuys Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department officials consider the neighborhood
surrounding Superior a high-crime area but not the worst one in the
Foothill Division, Capt. Kris Pitcher said. From Jan. 1 to Feb. 28,
the area accounted for 2% of violent crime in the division, he said.
And the store itself has not been a big source of problems.</TE>
<TE>   ''The statistics are showing there is relatively minor activity
happening on the store's premises,'' Pitcher said. Police received 13
calls for service to Superior in 2001 and six so far this
year--relatively low for a liquor-selling establishment, Pitcher
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police say it's hard to determine whether alcohol sales at the
market directly contribute to the area's crime. But some residents
believe they do.</TE>
<TE>   At the vigil, Tom Castro of Arleta pointed to the apartment
complex next to Superior where he said drunken vagrants gather.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill Senior Lead Officer Julian Almarez said there are often
fights and stabbings at the apartments.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's an ongoing problem that keeps getting worse,'' Castro said.
''In any other community where people are wealthier, you don't have
this kind of problem.''</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Alvarez, 60, who lives half a mile from Superior, said her
fence is often hit by drunk drivers. ''We love the store, but they
don't need an alcohol license,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees. Shopper Cruz Varraza, 65, of Pacoima says he
appreciates Superior's cleanliness and affordable prices. He doesn't
think the liquor license should be denied.</TE>
<TE>   ''They have alcohol all over; it doesn't matter to me,'' Varraza
said. ''But where there's poor people, there's alcohol; that's part
of life.''</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the vigil said Superior's presence isn't helping the
community. El Tigre market across the street and Food 4 Less a few
blocks away already provide the same services, said Edmundo
Delgadillo, alcohol prevention specialist for Pueblo y Salud.</TE>
<TE>   While Pueblo y Salud members hope Superior will not become simply
another place to buy alcohol, the community will remember the stand
taken by Flores.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's no one to replace him in Pacoima,'' said Reyna Salas,
who knew Flores for 20 years.</TE>

<HD>Lobbyists Donate Record Amount in 2001</HD>
<DH>Fund-raising: Their contributions to city candidates were
up 34%, ethics panel reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reflecting their growing influence in city government, lobbyists last
year contributed a record amount to local candidates and collected
more than $15 million to influence Los Angeles City Hall, also a
record.</LD>
<LD>   The city Ethics Commission reported Monday that contributions by
lobbyists increased 34% in 2001, reaching $853,571.</LD>
<LD>   Reform advocates and ethics officials said the data indicate that
lobbyists are exercising more clout over city government.</LD>
<TE>   "The public is clearly getting drowned out more and more as
contributions and lobbyist spending increase," said Wendy Wendlandt,
associate director of the California Public Interest Research Group.</TE>
<TE>   The report underscores the need for rules that would provide more
disclosure and limit influence by lobbyists, said LeeAnn Pelham,
executive director of the Ethics Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has proposed that elected officials be required to
abstain from voting on matters on which they have been contacted by a
lobbyist who has given them more than $1,000 in contributions. The
rules would also require recusals if lobbyists hold fund-raisers for
officials and would require lobbyists to disclose fund-raising
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Under existing rules, the Ethics Commission was able to report
Monday only on the amount that lobbyists acted as intermediaries for,
delivered or directly contributed to political candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The increase was troubling but no surprise to Bob Stern, head of
the Center for Governmental Studies and an author of the state's
political reform laws.</TE>
<TE>   Partly because of term limits, last year there were an
unprecedented number of hotly contested races for open city seats,
including expensive battles for mayor, city attorney, city controller
and eight City Council seats, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who benefited last year from lobbyist contributions include
Mayor James K. Hahn, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and newly elected
council members Dennis Zine, Tom LaBonge, Jack Weiss and Janice Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2nd Council District race, for which votes are still being
counted, Tony Cardenas received $25,000 from lobbyists during the
last three months of 2001, while his opponent, Wendy Greuel, received
$17,800, the commission reported. With about 1,200 ballots still to
be counted Monday, Greuel was leading by more than 300 votes.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, city candidates reported paying $274,241 last year
to lobbyists for campaign help. Under the commission's pending
measure, such payments would force the official's recusal.</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed that the amount clients paid for lobbying
set a record in 2001, but the increase was not as large as in the
past. Since 1997, lobbyists' compensation has increased an average of
$2 million a year until last year, when it increased just $3,604 to
$15.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics officials said some major development proposals and
multimillion-dollar city contracts were on the table last year,
spurring the spending by firms on lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   The most paid for lobbying a project last year was $716,454
seeking approval of cellular antennae sites, followed by $603,564
paid to lobbyists for the Playa Vista development and $506,100 paid
to lobbyists by bidders on a street toilet contract worth as much as
$750 million over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Greek Theatre contract, the Hollywood and Highland development
and bidders for cable TV franchises rounded out the top six.</TE>
<TE>   Other heavily lobbied development projects include a proposed
downtown sports and entertainment center, Pico Plaza, AvalonBay
Communities in west Los Angeles, Porter Ranch in the north San
Fernando Valley and Noho Commons in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Kindel, a lobbyist whose firm received the most
compensation last year--$1.2 million--said that in tight economies,
companies look to government for contracts and loans, which means
they turn more to lobbyists.</TE>

<HD>Actor's Fate Is in Pakistan's Hands</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Erik Aude, 21, is being held in jail near Islamabad
on an opium charge. U.S. officials say he may face death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Washington, State Department officials say they have done all they
can for Erik Aude. In Lancaster, his former teachers at Bethel
Christian School are praying for him.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the budding actor and former high school football star
now lies with the Pakistani justice system, which has been holding
the 21-year-old Antelope Valley resident on suspicion of opium
possession since his arrest on Feb. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Aude, who was arrested in the Islamabad airport allegedly carrying
3,600 grams of opium, could be sentenced to death, U.S. officials
said. Pakistani officials, however, have told the State Department he
is more likely to face 10 years to life in prison, said Christopher
Lamora, spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Aude's friends and family describe the situation as a nightmare.
His mother, Sherry Aude, said he is innocent. She said she has run up
huge phone bills looking for a good Pakistani lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "This child's an up-and-coming actor," said Aude, who runs a small
Lancaster casting company.</TE>
<TE>   "He can make this kind of money in a week."</TE>
<TE>   Erik Aude was a two-time All-Southern Section defensive end at
Bethel Christian, which held a prayer service for him last week. He
played a quarterback on the TV series "Reba," and a "muscle head" in
the teen movie "Dude, Where's My Car?"</TE>
<TE>   He is in a jail just south of Islamabad and will be arraigned
Saturday, U.S. officials said. His mother said he has witnessed the
hanging of numerous fellow inmates and has been threatened by others.</TE>
<TE>   While the State Department is trying to make sure Aude is not
mistreated, there is little else it can do if he is found guilty,
Lamora said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are expressing our interest in the well-being of this American
citizen [to local authorities]," he said. "But if someone breaks the
law in a foreign country, they are subject to the penalties of that
country."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan is struggling in its fight against opium traffickers,
especially from neighboring Afghanistan, one of the world's top opium
producers, State Department officials said. Pakistan also has one of
the worst heroin addiction problems, with 1.5 million to 3 million
users.</TE>
<TE>   The country came under fire in a recent State Department human
rights report, which cited incidents of prisoners being tortured,
jailed on false charges and held after their sentences expired.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Settles With Tollway, Can Start Freeway Project</HD>
<DH>Commuting: Payments could total $40,000 a year under
controversial noncompetition clause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in recent months, Orange County transportation
leaders have agreed to pay a toll road operator for the right to
improve a public freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The payment -- potentially $40,000 a year -- would compensate
operators of the San Joaquin Hills tollway for any customers it might
lose if a major bottleneck along the San Diego Freeway is eliminated.</LD>
<LD>   The push to relieve severe congestion at Jeffrey Road in Irvine on
the San Diego Freeway is one of 12 freeway choke points that the
Orange County Transportation Authority hopes to fix in $123-million
improvement efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway is covered by an agreement that
requires public highway projects to compensate it under certain
circumstances for any loss of business.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Transportation Authority officials had feared that
eight of 12 pending choke-point projects along the Santa Ana and San
Diego freeways might be subject to the requirement. But negotiations
with the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the tollway's operator,
eliminated all the proposals except one.</TE>
<TE>   "For $40,000 we avoided a lawsuit to stop the bottleneck project,"
said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, head of the agency board.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to
San Juan Capistrano, is part of a 51-mile network of turnpikes
operated by the Irvine-based agencies. All the routes are covered by
protection agreements that require public highway projects within
five miles of the toll roads to reimburse for losses of motorists if
the agency cannot pay the interest on its bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Such noncompetition clauses have become controversial in Orange
County, especially the pact between Caltrans and the California
Private Transportation Co., which operates the 91 Express Lanes on
the Riverside Freeway. The private lanes run along the middle of the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the Express Lanes deal can stand in the way of any
major improvements to the Riverside Freeway, one of the most
congested highways in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the authority agreed to pay $4million to California
Private Transportation just to add a 1,000-yard westbound access
lane.</TE>
<TE>   Toll officials say their noncompetition agreements are more
flexible than the Express Lanes' pact and allow competing projects to
proceed as long as they pay the toll agency for losses.</TE>

<HD>OCTA to Pay Tollway for Right to Add Freeway Lanes</HD>
<DH>Transit: Stipend to San Joaquin Hills operators would
compensate for any motorists who move to San Diego Freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in recent months, Orange County transportation
leaders have agreed to pay a toll road operator for the right to
improve a public freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The payment--potentially $40,000 a year--would compensate
operators of the San Joaquin Hills tollway for any customers it might
lose if a major bottleneck along the San Diego Freeway is eliminated.</LD>
<LD>   The push to relieve severe congestion at Jeffrey Road in Irvine on
the San Diego Freeway is one of 12 freeway choke points that the
Orange County Transportation Authority hopes to fix in $123-million
improvement efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway is covered by an agreement that
requires public highway projects to compensate it under certain
circumstances for any loss of business.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials had feared that eight of 12 pending choke-point
projects along the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways might be subject
to the requirement. But negotiations with the Transportation Corridor
Agencies, the tollway's operator, eliminated all the proposals except
one.</TE>
<TE>   "For $40,000 we avoided a lawsuit to stop the bottleneck project,"
said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, chairman of the OCTA board.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to
San Juan Capistrano, is part of a 51-mile network of turnpikes
operated by the Irvine-based agencies. The others are the Foothill,
the Eastern, and a short stretch of Highway California 133 (Laguna
Freeway).</TE>
<TE>   All the routes are covered by protection agreements that require
public highway projects within five miles of the toll roads to
reimburse for losses of motorists if the agency cannot pay the
interest on its bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Such noncompetition clauses have become controversial in Orange
County, especially the pact between Caltrans and the California
Private Transportation Co., which operates the 91 Express Lanes on
the Riverside Freeway. The private lanes run along the middle of the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the Express Lanes deal can stand in the way of any
major improvements to the Riverside Freeway, one of the most
congested highways in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, OCTA agreed to pay $4million to California Private
Transportation just to add a 1,000-yard westbound access lane.</TE>
<TE>   Toll officials say their noncompetition agreements are more
flexible than the Express Lanes' pact and allow competing projects to
proceed as long as they pay the toll agency for losses.</TE>
<TE>   Of the choke-point projects, the toll agency concluded that a lane
addition on the northbound side of the San Diego Freeway between Sand
Canyon Avenue and Jeffrey Road might decrease traffic by about 60
motorists a day, a tiny fraction of the 80,000 trips made daily on
the tollway. The agreement requires OCTA to compensate the agency for
the loss of tolls if it cannot meet its debt payments and if a
decrease in motorists occurs on the 16-mile toll road through west
Orange County. The tollway board is expected to approve the deal
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to an agreement that will improve traffic and protect our
bondholders," said Clare Climaco, a Transportation Corridor Agencies
spokeswoman. "The noncompetition clause doesn't stop improvement
projects from happening."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's action is part of an effort by OCTA to remove 12
bottlenecks on the Santa Ana, San Diego, Riverside and the Garden
Grove freeways. Ultimately, the authority wants to eliminate 30 choke
points it has identified.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tollway compensation plan, OCTA approved
$8.3million for preliminary design, engineering and environmental
assessments for five of the 12 projects. The proposals include ramp
widenings and new lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The five choke points are on the southbound Interstate 5 at Culver
Drive in Irvine, Oso Parkway in Mission Viejo, Camino Capistrano in
San Juan Capistrano, and Avenida Pico in San Clemente.</TE>

<HD>Jury to Deliberate Arleta Triple-Slaying</HD>
<DH>Courts: Juan Guillen is accused in the year-old crime at a
birthday party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three eyewitness and 15 bullets linking Juan Guillen to a triple
slaying were described by prosecutors Monday as keys to unraveling
one of the rare mass killings in the San Fernando Valley in recent
years.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors were set to begin deliberations today in the case of
Guillen, 26, who could face life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Guillen's defense focused on the fact that several witnesses are
admitted gang members, and that some witnesses testified that they
heard shots coming from more than one direction during a party the
night of Jan. 14, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels told jurors they
must push aside their notions of gang members when considering their
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "You have three gang members at this party, probably on drugs, and
I'm asking you to believe these witnesses," Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, if I could have picked my witnesses, I wouldn't have
picked these witnesses. But I didn't pick them, the defendant did,"
Samuels said.</TE>
<TE>   The three victims were alleged members of the Pacoima Trece gang:
Joel Gonzalez, 27, of Arleta; Jesse Abel, 24, of Pacoima; and Jack
Loutsios, 17, of Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   A ballistics experts from the Los Angeles Police Department
testified that 15 of 16 shell casings of bullets found at the scene,
a birthday party in Arleta, were fired from the same gun, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen, speaking from the courtroom holding cell in between
testimony during the trial, denied having anything against Abel. "We
grew up together," Guillen said.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen's attorney, Nancy Mazza, argued that Det. Jose Martinez
rushed to judgment and threatened witnesses, coercing them to name
Guillen.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen maintains that Martinez is carrying out a vendetta against
him.</TE>
<TE>   Mazza said her client was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She reminded jurors of testimony from neighbors who said they heard
shots from varying directions.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen had left gang life and went to the party to check on his
sound equipment, which was being used there, Mazza said.</TE>
<TE>   During a court break, Pattie Ramirez, who was engaged to Abel,
said a conviction of Guillen will be the only way to get closure.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter has been robbed of her father," said Ramirez, 27, of
Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's mother, Julia, said through tears that her son wasn't
involved in the gang. "I'm waiting for justice to be done," she said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Monday that he supports the
completion of the Belmont Learning Center, a massive high school
complex west of downtown that has been stalled by concerns about
environmental hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's approval gives an extra boost of support for the
beleaguered project, which Los Angeles school district Supt. Roy
Romer has been pushing to finish. The Board of Education is expected
to vote on the matter today.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, Hahn has expressed reservations about whether the
environmental problems could be resolved. The school is built on a
former oil field.</LD>
<TE>   But in a letter to the board on Monday, Hahn wrote that he is
satisfied that new measures will provide additional insurance against
environmental hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems that have plagued this project must not reoccur,"
Hahn wrote. "The community has placed its faith in this school board
to see that the Belmont project is completed in a timely manner. They
will be watching, as we all will, to ensure that the [district] not
only meets but exceeds expectations."</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, the mayor welcomed a new class of police recruits
to the Police Academy. The 49 men and women beginning the program
make up the largest training class since August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, you're going to get the best training there is, so we
want you to stay," Hahn said as he shook the hands of cadets at the
training center.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Monday that he supports the
completion of the Belmont Learning Center, a massive high school
complex west of downtown that has been stalled by concerns about
environmental hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's approval gives an extra boost of support for the
beleaguered project, which Los Angeles school district Supt. Roy
Romer has been pushing to finish. The Board of Education is expected
to vote on the matter today.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, Hahn has expressed reservations about whether the
environmental problems could be resolved. The school is built on a
former oil field.</LD>
<TE>   But in a letter to the board on Monday, Hahn wrote that he is
satisfied that new measures will provide additional insurance against
environmental hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems that have plagued this project must not reoccur,"
Hahn wrote. "The community has placed its faith in this school board
to see that the Belmont project is completed in a timely manner. They
will be watching, as we all will, to ensure that the [district] not
only meets but exceeds expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Hahn continued to press the twin priorities of his
administration: highlighting the need for more police officers and
convincing dissatisfied residents that they should remain a part of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, the mayor welcomed a new class of police recruits
to the Police Academy. The 49 men and women beginning the program
make up the largest training class since August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, you're going to get the best training there is, so we
want you to stay," Hahn said as he shook the hands of cadets lined up
inside the Ahmanson Recruit Training Center in Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   During an address to the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce, the
mayor said he is worried that the number of LAPD officers has dipped
below 9,000 at the same time that crime has shot up. "I think it's a
direct correlation from having fewer police officers available," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the process for getting hired by the LAPD has been
slashed from one year to 120 days, and said he would do more to beef
up the department by reforming the discipline system.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also announced a new initiative that will provide more
information about city services to the business improvement
districts, and a new program that makes business permits available
over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make this city better, we're going to make it
safer," he said. "We're going to make it so wonderful that you
wouldn't even think about leaving us."</TE>

<HD>Help Coming for Displaced Tenants</HD>
<DH>Housing: L.A. officials are devising a plan to aid renters
who are forced out, especially by slum conditions. A new state law
may offer guidance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One night last September, Cecilia Bryan lost everything she owned in
an apartment fire.</LD>
<LD>   Through a haze of ash and disbelief, she watched the destruction.
Then the single mother of four arrived at the same stark question
every survivor eventually asks.</LD>
<LD>   "I kept looking at my kids [thinking], 'What am I going to do now?
Where am I going to go?'"</LD>
<TE>   Each year scores of people lose their homes to a variety of
calamities. With affordable housing in short supply in Los Angeles,
the loss of a home can mean a long search for another home--or
homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Now a study being conducted by the city's Housing Department is
laying the foundation for a citywide relocation policy for low-income
residents who are displaced from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, we don't want people to become homeless,"
said Sally Richman, manager of policy and planning at the Los Angeles
Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Los Angeles City Council, which requested the
study, expect to have a policy in place by the fiscal year that
begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Although statistics are not kept on the number of people displaced
from their homes each year, local officials say the need is
significant, particularly for those who lose homes because of slum
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles study, which includes an examination of services
offered by 21 local nonprofits, is revealing what many survivors
know: Little exists for tenants who are the victims of unscrupulous
or negligent property owners.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really not anyone to help them right now," said Julie
Chavez, who is coordinating the study.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross provides services to those displaced by house fires
and other calamities but does not assist residents who must move
because of code violations.</TE>
<TE>   Such crises have sometimes ended up at the office of the Los
Angeles Homeless Services Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "A council office [would] call saying, 'Hey, this building is
going to close. Can you help us relocate these people?" said Natalie
Profant Komuro, director of policy and legislative affairs for the
Homeless Services Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a relocation policy and fund has been bandied about
for years, but the need was underscored by a tragic building collapse
in December 2000. The 24-unit apartment building fell, killing one
resident and leaving scores homeless. Most were poor immigrant
families.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Los Angeles City Council allocated $500,000 to an
emergency relocation fund but still lacked a clear policy for use of
the money.</TE>
<TE>   By August, officials were tapping that fund to assist residents of
the Palomar Hotel, a residential hotel that burned down, leaving two
people dead and dozens of tenants with no place to live.</TE>
<TE>   In both the building collapse and the fire, the City Council made
payments ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 to help residents move into
new homes.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent $125,000 to assist 64 adults and 38 children from
the collapsed Echo Park building. Another $101,000 went to the 35
residents of the Palomar Hotel, housing officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For David Barling, a former resident of the Palomar, the help from
the city has meant the difference between a corner on skid row and a
roomy apartment in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "If the city had not done that, I don't know what would have
happened to all of us. We had nothing to help us, nothing at all,"
Barling said. "I would have had to go live on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Barling found a unit in a Hollywood apartment building where his
rent is $350, or $30 less than what he paid at the hotel. Not
everyone was so fortunate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A great many people did not find housing," he said. "There are
many people that had to move downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates hope to keep tenants off the street by raising
awareness of their needs--but also, in some instances, teaching them
how to budget and set priorities for housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Inner City Law Center, which administered the funds to
residents of the Echo Park building and the Palomar, did more than
hand out checks. It first had to identify the true residents of the
building--not an easy task when many had lost purses and wallets
containing identification in the blaze. In some cases, the center
shuttled residents to the bank and made arrangements with a bank to
cash checks for tenants without identification.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the policy under study by the city acknowledge the
near-impossibility of offering assistance to every family. "I think
we need to quantify how many people we're talking about. Obviously we
can't do earthquakes," said Rod Field, executive director of the Los
Angeles Housing Law Center, who helped draft a new state law that
allows municipalities to provide relocation assistance to tenants of
substandard buildings, then recoup the money from building owners.
Cities across the state are now implementing that law. The current
study will begin to answer key questions: Under what circumstances
will residents receive assistance? Who will be eligible? What
restrictions will be placed on the use of the funds?</TE>
<TE>   An interim policy limits relocation payments to tenants of older,
rent-controlled buildings, although the City Council can approve
assistance for renters in structures built after 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors with the L.A. Housing Department issued orders to
vacate 126 units in 2001, leaving scores of people either temporarily
or permanently without a place to live.</TE>
<TE>   Other agencies, such as the Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety, can also order buildings vacated.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords are required to offer relocation assistance to these
tenants. Often, though, landlords cannot be found, or simply do not
obey the law. Sometimes the only remedy for tenants is costly and
lengthy lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new state law, written by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los
Angeles), cities can advance money to tenants, then recoup the money
from landlords at a rate of 1 1/2 times the amount the city put out.
That money can be used to help replenish the relocation fund.</TE>
<TE>   A requirement to pay relocation benefits will also deter landlords
from driving tenants out of substandard buildings, only to repair the
units, bring in new tenants and charge higher rents, said Tai Glenn
of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the Red Cross provides much of the assistance to
those who find themselves suddenly homeless. In 2001, the agency's
local chapter found shelter for 2,896 people, including Cecilia Bryan
and her family. For Bryan, whose apartment burned Sept. 11, the help
turned a tragedy into a testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The night of the fire, Bryan, a clerk, had $200 and no family or
friends who could help. The Red Cross became the network she lacked.</TE>
<TE>   The agency helped with hotel vouchers, finding an apartment,
moving costs, furnishing, clothes. Workers gave her the boost she

<HD>Panel Drafts Terms of L.A.-Valley Split</HD>

<LD>If the proposed secession of the San Fernando Valley from Los Angeles
were a marital divorce, you could say that, as of Monday, the judge
had a tentative plan for dividing the couple's assets.</LD>
<LD>   A subcommittee of the Local Agency Formation Commission on Monday
wrapped up its work on the terms and conditions of a Valley-L.A.
split. The subcommittee's recommendations now go to the full LAFCO
board, which regulates the incorporation of new cities.</LD>
<LD>   The subcommittee's plan favors secessionists in several areas. It
would grant a new city significant assets, including parks, police
and fire stations, and libraries. It would also forbid Los Angeles
from charging Valley residents higher utility rates than those paid
by L.A. customers.</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO is scheduled to decide in May whether to place the secession
proposal on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   It is also reviewing secession bids for Hollywood and the harbor
area.</TE>
<TE>   Under the subcommittee's terms, a Valley city would pay Los
Angeles $36.6 million per year in so-called alimony. That would make
up for tax revenue lost by Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The alimony figure is much lower than the original estimate of $65
million, but only because a new city would take on more debt,
including to help pay for the physical assets.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would keep its power grid, sewer system and other
utilities intact.</TE>
<TE>   It would also keep all property easements related to the
utilities, even those that run under assets owned by a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   A new city would contract with Los Angeles for a variety of vital
services, including police and fire protection.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll Rises as Israel Presses Hunt for Militants</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAHAISHA REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli army tanks smashed into the Jabaliya refugee camp in the
Gaza Strip late Monday and drove to the heart of Ramallah in the West
Bank as Israel intensified its hunt for militants. Palestinians reported
at least 22 dead and 75 injured in heavy fighting in Jabaliya, the
largest refugee camp in Gaza.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli television reported that shortly before midnight, about 50
tanks entered the sprawling camp, which is home to about 100,000 refugees
and is a bastion of militancy. Gun battles erupted immediately. Within an
hour, Gazan hospital officials reported receiving a dozen dead.
Palestinians said some of the wounded lay bleeding in the streets as
ambulances were delayed at army checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   By this morning, the army said it had pulled out of Jabaliya, after
destroying what a spokeswoman said were 25 workshops where Kassam rockets
and mortar shells were made.</LD>
<TE>   In the West Bank, the army said it took over Al Birah, Ramallah and
the Al Amari refugee camp overnight. There were no initial reports of
injuries, but Palestinians said tanks were shelling the refugee camp and
had blown up the home there of a female suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said troops were conducting house-to-house
searches "to protect Israeli citizens from terrorism." Palestinian
sources in Ramallah said streets were empty as residents locked
themselves in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, hundreds of Palestinian men and boys--stripped to their
undershirts, their hands on their heads--waited in line for hours outside
a stonecutting factory here at the Dahaisha refugee camp near Bethlehem
for Israeli troops to handcuff, blindfold and interrogate them.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it rounded up about 600 boys and men, ages 13 to 45, in
Dahaisha and about 500 in the West Bank town of Kalkilya. An army
spokeswoman said she did not know if any of the wanted militants had been
found.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon confirmed that Israel had
partially lifted travel restrictions on Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat. The government had used tanks to confine Arafat to the
West Bank city of Ramallah since December.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon told members of parliament from his right-wing Likud Party that
despite his decision to ease restrictions on Arafat and to drop a demand
for seven days of quiet before Israel will start cease-fire talks, the
military's widespread operations in Palestinian-controlled territories
would continue.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 Israelis and Palestinians have died in the fighting
since the beginning of March. The surging violence has cast doubt on the
chances for success of a new Bush administration effort to secure a
cease-fire. President Bush's envoy, Anthony C. Zinni, is due in Jerusalem
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said Israel's actions on the ground made its decision to
partially free Arafat insignificant. Palestinian Information Minister
Yasser Abed-Rabbo called on Israel "to end the closure that all the
Palestinian people have been living under for more than 18 months."</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat does tour Palestinian-controlled areas, he will find many of
their police stations and government buildings, as well as his house and
offices on Gaza's seashore, reduced to rubble by Israeli air raids.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's office said Arafat would be free to travel within
Palestinian-controlled territories because he arrested all the suspects
in October's assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi. The
Palestinian leader will have to request permission from Israel to travel
abroad, including to an upcoming Arab summit in Beirut, where Saudi
Arabia is expected to present a peace plan.</TE>
<TE>   Troops began rounding up Palestinian males in Dahaisha at 6 a.m.
Monday, in an operation similar to one carried out in a refugee camp near
the West Bank town of Tulkarm over the weekend. In Tulkarm, troops
detained more than 1,000 men and boys, arresting about 30 of them. The
army has said the mass detentions are part of its effort to break the
infrastructure of militant groups that are carrying out attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein Hamash, 40, said he walked to the quarry by the stonecutting
factory after troops using loudspeakers demanded that Dahaisha's men turn
themselves in. "I thought it was better than having them come and get
me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife had cowered in their house through the night with
their six children. First the camp was shelled, then troops began cutting
through the walls of the cinder block houses on the outskirts to search
for suspects without having to walk the camp's narrow alleys.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrible situation," Hamash said. "Women cried, children
were frightened. The camp was surrounded."</TE>
<TE>   Hamash, who is diabetic, said he was held at the quarry for nine hours
before being released after nine hours when a computer check showed he
had no security record. He had been seen by an army doctor, given water
and two pieces of bread to eat during the ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of men remained in the courtyard of the factory, awaiting
interrogation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, Hamash said, "is unnecessary." The armed men, he said,
fled the camp days earlier after Israel launched its current offensive by
raiding the Balata refugee camp near Nablus, in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The Popular Resistance Committees said there should be no resistance,
that they learned from the experience of the other camps, Tulkarm and
Balata, where there was resistance and people were killed," Hamash said,
referring to an umbrella organization of militants.</TE>
<TE>   The mass roundups are not intended to be "an action against
civilians," an Israeli army spokeswoman said Monday night. "We have no
interest in arresting innocent people. That is why they are free to go
after a maximum of a day or so."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to capturing some wanted men, the army has uncovered arms
caches and weapons factories in its raids. But thousands of civilians
have been placed under curfew for days at a time, and dozens of civilians
have been injured or killed during the operations. Six Palestinians were
killed Monday before the army's incursion into Jabaliya, shot dead in
exchanges of fire with troops in Kalkilya, the Gaza Strip and the village
of Yatta in the West Bank, according to Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of Israeli tanks, an armored personnel carrier and a bulldozer
stood guard outside Dahaisha on Monday. Inside the camp, Bethlehem Road,
the main street, was littered with the debris of war: a downed lamppost,
an unlit Molotov cocktail, stones, tires and trash. Shops were tightly
shuttered, front doors locked.</TE>
<TE>   People remained confined to their homes, where some said they were
running low on food and water. Water supplies were disrupted when Israeli
bulldozers hit pipes as they dug trenches across the camp's main road to
prevent the passage of cars. Residents said they have been afraid to come
out of their homes since Friday afternoon, when troops first surrounded
the camp. They have been under curfew since soldiers entered late Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   No one was killed Monday in Dahaisha, and troops pulled out this
morning. But the blood of Issa Faraj, 24, who was killed Friday, remained
on the carpet in his living room and on the walls, floors and toys in the
room his two children share. The date of his death, March 8, was written
in blood on one wall.</TE>
<TE>   Faraj was fatally injured in the children's room when two bullets,
which his wife believes were fired by Israeli troops, tore through the
third-story window. Ahlam Faraj, the 21-year-old widow, said her husband
was sitting on the floor playing with Legos with his daughter when he was
hit twice in the chest. He staggered into the living room before he
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "He just looked into my eyes," said Faraj, her voice choking with
emotion. "I wish I had died with him."</TE>
<TE>   Faraj said they managed to get her husband to a nearby hospital in
Beit Jala, but doctors there could not treat his gaping wounds. By the
time an ambulance could get clearance to pass through Israeli army
checkpoints to take him to a Jerusalem hospital, she said, he was dead.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said she knew of no exchange of gunfire in that
area of the camp Friday afternoon. Passage of the ambulance was delayed,
she said, because the Palestinian hospital staff did not coordinate with
the army.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military analysts say the incursions into refugee camps serve
mainly to underscore the army's determination to send troops anywhere and
to do whatever it takes to slow a wave of suicide attacks. The bombings
have demoralized Israelis and undermined Sharon's political support.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister's political problems were highlighted Monday night
by a rally of 50,000 to 60,000 right-wing activists in Tel Aviv's Rabin
Square. Waving banners calling for Arafat's expulsion from the West Bank,
the demonstrators called on Sharon to "return to himself" and launch an
all-out war to crush the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the crowd advocated the mass expulsion of Palestinians living
in the West Bank and Gaza. More than 1,600 police officers and other
security forces were deployed to protect the crowd from possible
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The rally came as political pundits here were calling the decision of
the tiny, far-right National Union-Israel Beitenu party to bolt from
Sharon's broad-based coalition the beginning of the end of the
government. The party's two ministers said they would resign from the
Cabinet today. They cited Sharon's decision to negotiate under fire and
to allow Arafat to leave Ramallah as evidence that the government is not
serious about defeating the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The defection is expected to increase the centrist Labor Party's
influence in the government because Sharon's majority in the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, will be narrowed. If Labor pulls out, Sharon would
lose his majority.</TE>

<HD>Bush Begins Second Phase of Terror War</HD>
<DH>Military: The president vows to confront threats 'anywhere in the
world' and deny terrorists safe harbor. A White House ceremony marks six
months since Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday marked the six months that have passed
since Sept. 11 by detailing the start of the counter-terrorism war's
second phase, promising "a sustained campaign . . . anywhere in the
world" to deny sanctuaries for those seeking to launch attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In summarizing his plan for carrying the war beyond the battles in
Afghanistan, Bush emphasized two key components: that any government will
be viewed as a foe unless it acts to "help remove the terrorist
parasites," and that any nation posing a threat with chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons will be confronted.</LD>
<LD>   "Men with no respect for life must never be allowed to control the
ultimate instruments of death," Bush said. "Against such an enemy, there
is no immunity, and there can be no neutrality."</LD>
<TE>   The president's tough words concluded a solemn ceremony on the White
House's South Lawn that served to recall the terrorist attacks on the
nearby Pentagon and the World Trade Center in New York. Observances of
the day that claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people also were
conducted at those sites and around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The White House event was held on a sunny but blustery morning; among
the well-bundled audience of 1,300 were family members of those who died
on Sept. 11, police, fire and rescue workers who responded to the
disaster and busloads of public officials.</TE>
<TE>   The carefully choreographed event was designed to vividly depict the
vast international coalition arrayed against those whom Bush often
describes as the "evil ones."</TE>
<TE>   As the president spoke, Vice President Dick Cheney met in London with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of Bush's most stalwart supporters
within the coalition. Cheney is on his way to the Middle East to rally
support for the war's next phase, which may extend to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There is growing angst within Blair's own Labor Party over the
prospect of an attack on Baghdad, with some insisting any such campaign
must be led by the United Nations. The prime minister emphasized that no
decisions have been made, while saying he agreed that the danger of rogue
nations possessing weapons of mass destruction must be "properly dealt
with."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney stressed that the United States would engage in "the closest
possible consultation-coordination" with Britain before accelerating its
efforts to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also announced late Monday that Bush will travel to
Germany, Russia and France in May to further promote the war on
terrorism, among other matters.</TE>
<TE>   In the hourlong White House ceremony, the president was preceded to
the podium by the ambassadors from Nigeria, South Korea and
Turkey--chosen to demonstrate "the depth and breadth" of the global
alliance, a White House official said. As they lauded Bush's leadership
and publicly renewed their own countries' vows to fight terrorism, the
flags of 179 nations that form the coalition flapped behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also made a point of singling out the contributions of several
nations to the fight in Afghanistan, mentioning France, Japan, Russia,
Jordan, Canada, Norway and Denmark among them.</TE>
<TE>'Victory Will Come Over Time,' Bush Says</TE>
<TE>   Even as Bush discussed the war's next stages, he sought to reassure
Americans by saying an end will come to the anti-terrorism campaign. In
the past, Bush has cautioned that the multi-pronged efforts to defeat Al
Qaeda and other terrorist groups would be lengthy, probably extending
beyond his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Victory will come over time, as [the terrorist] network is patiently
and steadily dismantled," Bush said Monday. "There will be a day when the
organized threat against America, our friends and allies will be broken."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats have raised questions recently about the direction of
the counter-terrorism campaign, with Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) saying that the drive's continued success was "still somewhat in
doubt," especially if Osama bin Laden and other top Al Qaeda leaders
remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's remarks seemed at least in part aimed at addressing such
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   He said the United States stands ready to provide training and other
resources to nations fighting terrorists who threaten their
governments--calling this a key element of the war's second stage. But he
also said he will not dispatch American soldiers "to every battle."</TE>
<TE>   Bush used his speech to offer a broader perspective on what has
occurred since Sept. 11. That date, he said, "was not the beginning of
global terror, but it was the beginning of the world's concerted
response."</TE>
<TE>   "History will know that day not only as a day of tragedy, but as a day
of decision--when the civilized world was stirred to anger and to action.
And the terrorists will remember Sept. 11 as the day their reckoning
began."</TE>
<TE>   The six months also have marked a passage for Bush--he has emerged as
a determined and sure-footed world leader. That stands in sharp contrast
to his initial image on the international stage: that of a largely
untested president who seemed to scoff at the need for coalitions to
address world problems.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has won--and sustained--strong support for his
prosecution of the war on terrorism. But the coalition he has
painstakingly assembled now faces new tests--in part because of the war's
expanding mission, which began as an effort to target Osama bin Laden and
his supporters, including the erstwhile ruling Taliban regime in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's bellicose language toward Iran, Iraq and North
Korea--especially the "axis of evil" term he used in his State of the
Union speech in January--alarmed some coalition partners, who fear that
an attack on Baghdad could destabilize the entire Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns escalated with last weekend's disclosure that the
administration intends to build smaller nuclear weapons for possible use
against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Iran and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   In his Monday address, Bush softened his rhetoric a bit.</TE>
<TE>   He did not repeat his controversial "axis of evil" phrase or name any
potential targets in the war's new phase. Still, the president left no
doubt about his policy aims or the perils that remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is what we already know: Some states that sponsor terror are
seeking or already possess weapons of mass destruction. . . ," Bush said.
"These facts cannot be denied and must be confronted . . . inaction is
not an option."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently referring to Cheney's trip, Bush noted: "America is now
consulting with friends and allies about this greatest of dangers, and
we're determined to confront it."</TE>
<TE>Terrorists Must Be Hounded, Bush Says</TE>
<TE>   Although allied forces have killed "hundreds of trained killers," Bush
said, "others are still on the run, hoping to strike again. These
terrorist fighters are the most committed, the most dangerous and the
least likely to surrender."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, "there must be no refuge, no safe haven" for
terrorists of any stripe.</TE>
<TE>   "Every terrorist must be made to live as an international fugitive,
with no place to settle or organize, no place to hide, no governments to
hide behind and not even a safe place to sleep," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He briefly outlined the steps the United States already has taken to
accomplish that goal. He noted that 500 U.S. troops have been dispatched
to the Philippines to train forces fighting terrorists there, and that
similar help is planned for the Republic of Georgia and Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill reported that U.S.
authorities have made significant progress in working with other
countries to destroy the money pipeline that has fueled Al Qaeda. These
efforts, O'Neill said, have cramped the network's ability to launch
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, he said, more than $104 million in financial assets
linked to Al Qaeda and the Taliban have been blocked worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon ceremony, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was
flanked by representatives of 29 countries that are participating in the
war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the Sept. 11 attacks, he said: "Our world has changed a
great deal. It has awakened to the threat of terrorism. And as all can
see here, the civilized nations of the world have reached truly new
levels of cooperation, unity and strength. We have the opportunity to
tear terrorism out by the roots."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, construction workers behind him continued repairing the
gash in the Pentagon caused by the hijacked plane that crashed into it.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House later in the day, Bush unveiled a commemorative
45-cent stamp that not only honors the heroes of Sept. 11 but provides
financial aid to the families of emergency relief workers by earmarking
for them 8 cents from each stamp.</TE>
<TE>   The stamp, which shows three firefighters raising the American flag
over the rubble of the World Trade Center, is the first in U.S. history
to depict individuals that are still living. It will be available next
month.</TE>

<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>During the Cold War, the purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons was
straightforward: to deter an attack on the United States by the other
nuclear superpower, the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   But now the most frightening threats to American security come not
from nuclear powers, but from terrorists such as Osama bin Laden and
rogue states such as Iraq. The Pentagon's proposed new nuclear strategy,
outlined in a secret report that came to light last week, is intended to
make atomic weapons useful again--by making them threatening to a new set
of enemies.</LD>
<LD>   The report, called the Nuclear Posture Review, proposed building a new
generation of atomic weapons designed not to destroy the nuclear arsenals
of Russia or China but to attack underground command posts and biological
weapon facilities.</LD>
<TE>   The overall purpose, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld wrote, is
"to provide the president with a range of options to defeat any
aggressor."</TE>
<TE>   But the study has provoked vigorous debate among nuclear strategists
on several counts.</TE>
<TE>   Should the United States use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear
forces, a significant change in policy? Will the new strategy make it
more likely that the United States--or any other nuclear power, a group
that includes China, India and Pakistan--would use atomic weapons in a
crisis? And do we even know that nuclear weapons would successfully deter
terrorists or tyrants?</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we could deter the Soviet Union, because the Soviets had a
lot of people and other assets to protect," said Hans Binnendijk, a
nuclear weapon expert at the Pentagon's National Defense University. "But
we're not sure that theology works anymore. . . . Rogue states and
non-state actors [such as terrorists] have less to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials acknowledge that it will be difficult to
deter attacks by rogue states or terrorists. But they said the report's
emphasis on new kinds of nuclear weapons is intended to make that kind of
deterrence possible--not to make a nuclear war easier to start.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want to make the use of weapons of mass destruction less
likely," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said in a television
interview. "The way that you do that is to send a very strong signal to
anyone who might try to use weapons of mass destruction against the
United States that [they] would be met with a devastating response."</TE>
<TE>   But liberal critics argue that the administration's new course is
hazardous too.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very dangerous policy," said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear
proliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"The test is: How would we feel if other countries adopted the same
policy? I'm not talking about rogue states. What if India developed
nuclear weapons to go after terrorists in the Himalayas? Would we feel
safer then?"</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said the new policy, which is still evolving,
wasn't designed principally to deal with terrorists but rather with the
threat of biological weapons, especially in the hands of a regime such as
Saddam Hussein's in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>A Counter to Threat of Biological Warfare</TE>
<TE>   If a hostile regime attacked the United States with a virulent
biological agent such as smallpox, the casualty figures could resemble
those from a nuclear exchange, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the facts of biological weapons are so enormous, we have to
do all we can to deter their use," a senior official said. "One of the
ways you deter is to make it clear you're not ruling any options off the
table."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, in the administration's view, building new nuclear weapons
designed for use against smaller countries doesn't make their use any
more likely. Instead, it should make their use less likely by deterring
attacks against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The same logic is behind the Pentagon's interest in building new
"Earth-penetrating weapons" with nuclear warheads to destroy underground
bunkers, such as those Bin Laden used in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were in a conventional war with a country that used biological
weapons against our soldiers or our homeland, I can envision a president
retaliating by using these weapons against their leaders," Binnendijk
said. "And if that becomes a credible threat--if their leaders know it's
there--then it also becomes a deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   But critics don't buy that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has . . . eliminated the line between nuclear
weapons and chemical and biological weapons," Cirincione said. "They talk
about 'weapons of mass destruction' as if mustard gas were the equivalent
of a nuclear weapon that could destroy a city. It just isn't true.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States used to tell countries that if they did not acquire
nuclear weapons, we would not attack them with our nuclear weapons. This
administration has abandoned that policy. . . . Now there's no reason for
other countries to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military strategists considered using nuclear weapons several
times in the last half century but always shied away.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, Pentagon officials considered using nuclear
weapons against Communist forces in China, North Korea and North Vietnam.
And the United States stationed thousands of nuclear artillery shells and
other tactical nuclear weapons in Western Europe for use in the event of
a Soviet ground invasion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, President Bush warned that he might retaliate with nuclear
weapons if Iraqi leader Hussein used chemical weapons against U.S.
forces. But Bush later wrote that he never intended to carry out the
threat.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, during the Clinton administration, Defense Secretary William
J. Perry renewed the warning, saying a nation that used chemical weapons
"would have to fear the consequences of a response from any weapon in our
inventory."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, one official said, the Bush administration is merely
taking that policy and calling for new weapons to make it more effective.</TE>
<TE>Some Want Debate to Focus on Strategic Issues</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials did not seem especially perturbed by the leak
of the Nuclear Posture Review, even though the report was officially
classified. Some said privately that a national debate on nuclear
strategy might be healthy.</TE>
<TE>   But they complained that newspapers that reported on the issue focused
on the report's list of seven countries as nuclear targets--Russia,
China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya--more than larger
strategic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing we're trying to do is to reduce our dependence on
nuclear weapons," a senior official said. "That report isn't just about
new nuclear systems. It also says we should rely more on conventional
weapons and on defensive systems."</TE>

<DL>SHAHI KOT VALLEY, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Hardened Afghan soldiers with tanks, rocket launchers and mortars
advanced to the edge of this valley Monday, vowing to clean out nests of
Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters who might still be lurking in its labyrinth
of caves despite more than a week of bombing and firefights with U.S.
troops.</LD>
<LD>   No one knows how many enemy fighters might be in the valley after the
U.S.-led onslaught, but the newly arriving Afghan forces clearly expected
danger as they prepared to enter an area that many believe is the last
stronghold of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to Afghan warriors, U.S. and Australian special forces
were still operating in the area. However, the bulk of regular U.S.
troops were being flown back to Bagram air base about 125 miles north of
the region, satisfied that the heaviest fighting was over.</LD>
<TE>   The long column of Afghans, which lumbered out of the dusty provincial
capital of Gardez about 7 a.m., consisted of 12 tanks, other military
equipment and about 500 troops, said Abdul Matin, an Afghan brigade
commander.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers are under the command of a former Northern Alliance
general, Gul Hydar, who was sent to Gardez with 1,000 troops Friday by
the Afghan Defense Ministry. They are to reinforce a U.S.-trained Afghan
force led by Gen. Zia Lodin, which has been in the campaign since it was
launched March 2.</TE>
<TE>   The troops moved slowly over the bumpy, rutted, packed-earth road out
of Gardez. Atop their tanks, bystanders said, soldiers smiled and waved
their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Matin said the arrival of the troops from Kabul, the capital, was
"very important" for Afghanistan's interim government, led by Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai, because it represented the first steps toward
creating a national army.</TE>
<TE>   "Anywhere in the country where there is trouble, forces should be sent
out by the Defense Ministry to help," Matin said.</TE>
<TE>   By about 6 p.m., Hydar's forces had taken up positions at an entrance
to the valley, he said. Matin described the valley as very long, with
four or five entrances. When entering the valley, the Afghan force will
have to contend with whatever enemy hide-outs have not yet been detected
and bombed, as well as with land mines and booby traps laid by the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Having visited the caves during his days as a moujahedeen fighter
against Soviet occupiers in the 1980s, Matin said it was good that
Afghans would do the close-in dirty work of seeking the last hiding
places of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "The pathways to the caves are very hard to see for the Americans, and
the caves themselves are labyrinthine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Matin, who held a black Walther automatic in his lap, fiddled with a
hand-held radio and talked to a reporter while riding in the back of a
Toyota Land Cruiser, said he expected the final battle for Shahi Kot to
begin within two or three days. Another soldier said he was told that the
first fighting would take place before dawn today. As Monday night wore
on, coalition aircraft could be heard crisscrossing the area.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Bagram, a U.S. Special Forces senior officer, who identified
himself only as Lt. Col. Mark, cautioned that the most risky part of the
mission--scouring mountain ridges and caves for remaining Al Qaeda
operatives--was still ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we back these kind of folks into a corner, the more
desperate they are going to be," he said. He added that between 100 and
200 enemy fighters were believed to be hunkered down "just trying to
survive" in a system of caves high in the mountains overlooking the
valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the number is, but it's not a big one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Army Lt. Col. Chris Bentley, fire support coordinator for the
operation, said Air Force and Marine aircraft had destroyed about 20
caves using ordnance including thermobaric bombs, which draw the oxygen
out of a cave and leave it intact for further intelligence-gathering.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said U.S. and
allied forces hope to finish "mopping up" Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
in the valley by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said several prisoners had been taken and "a great many"
enemy fighters killed in the offensive. Other officials have estimated
the number killed at more than 700.</TE>
<TE>   Additional U.S. troops returned to the Bagram air base Monday from the
fighting zone. Four CH-47 Chinook helicopters disgorged what appeared to
be more than 100 soldiers. Army officials declined to quantify by how
much the U.S. force in the Shahi Kot area has been reduced and stressed
that the battle, dubbed Operation Anaconda, continued.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, more details on the battle to date emerged, showing a
mixture of mistaken estimates of enemy numbers and position, combined
with a rapid response by U.S. troops forced into a defensive posture. And
it became clear that an air attack, the dominant element of the U.S. war
until Operation Anaconda's ground warfare, helped reverse the fortune of
ground troops.</TE>
<TE>   Many returning troops said that, given the intensity and accuracy of
the Al Qaeda and Taliban attacks and mortar fire, it was nearly
miraculous that there weren't more U.S. casualties--reported as eight
killed and more than 80 wounded. Several companies reported being pinned
down for hours, and one of them for nearly a day.</TE>
<TE>   Originally intending to take up "blocking positions" to capture Al
Qaeda and Taliban pockets flushed out by Lodin, U.S. troops quickly found
themselves under fire and on the defensive. But that failure came after
Lodin apparently encountered enemy forces far closer to him than where
U.S. intelligence had pinpointed them and after he was bombarded with
mortars.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember what it is we asked Commander Zia to do on
D-day," said Mark, the Special Forces lieutenant colonel. "We asked him
to be the lead element, to move into an area where we thought we had
identified a pocket--the remaining significant pocket--of Al Qaeda and
Taliban resistance. He found where the leading edge of his defense was,
which was different than where we thought it would be."</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant colonel said it was possible that enemy forces had
advance warning of the attack, possibly from increased helicopter flights
over the area in the weeks preceding the operation. He declined to blame
the surprising level of resistance on an intelligence failure.</TE>
<TE>   "He got knocked down," Mark said of Lodin. "And then he got back up
and he came back again into the same place where he lost about 10% of his
people. And then he did it a third time. And he's not done."</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces officer's spirited defense of Lodin came amid
reports from the battlefield that, several times, the Afghan commander
and his force of about 400 had failed to advance when expected.</TE>
<TE>   It was only after air support arrived for both Lodin's forces and
pinned-down U.S. troops that the battle could be reversed, according to
soldiers involved.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Miller, 27, a psychological operations specialist from St.
Louis, was among the first on the ground on the initial day of the
operation. He said he was assigned to set up loudspeakers to warn
civilians away from U.S. troops, as a way of determining who was hostile
and who was a civilian fleeing villages in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, 150 yards from the landing zone, enemy forces opened up on
the U.S. troops with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The
Americans were pinned down for an hour in the hilly terrain before
helicopter gunships scattered or killed the attacking fighters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Company, consisting of about 45 men from the 1st Battalion of
the 101st Airborne Division's 187th Regiment, moved to another blocking
position about three miles to the northwest, where they were subjected to
a barrage of accurate mortar and machine-gun fire.</TE>
<TE>   "They pretty much had us running around for a while, because we
couldn't get their position," Miller said. "The closest [explosion] to me
was just 20 meters [66 feet] away. . . . Shrapnel was flying overhead."</TE>
<TE>   For six hours, the men of Charlie Company were pinned down, with
mortar shells landing at some points every few seconds. This time, a B-52
blew out the key mortar position about 1 1/2 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, it was just sporadic," Miller said. "The threat was
pretty much over by then."</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and Taliban forces apparently then launched a desperate
assault on Charlie Company's position with 200 fighters, Miller said. But
aircraft spotted them, along with a column of nine vehicles mounted with
machine guns approaching from another direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We would've spotted them eventually, because we had all the high
ground," Miller said. But air coverage enabled them to hold their
position.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, the 200 people were neutralized from the air," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the attacks, despite what quickly became U.S. troop
superiority on high ground, surprised Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't holding back," he said. "We gave them every chance to
surrender. They had their minds set on killing Americans."</TE>

<HD>Fleeing to Culture Shock</HD>
<DH>As the number of North Korean defectors in the South grows, so does
awareness of their plight. Their hunger assuaged, many still struggle to
assimilate.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUCHEON, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>Kim Kang Chul steered past the clutter of fast-food restaurants
that make up the bustling streetscape of this Seoul suburb. There are KFC
restaurants and Dunkin' Donuts, and towering above them billboards
advertising mobile telephones and yet more fast food.</LD>
<LD>   Kim hasn't stopped marveling at the incongruity of it all: that he,
having fled a small North Korean town where you're counted rich for
eating rice instead of corn, should be living amid this 21st century
capitalist bounty, driving his own car, albeit a snub-nosed subcompact
Hyundai purchased with installment payments.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe I'm driving myself around. There are no private cars
in North Korea," said Kim, deftly braking at a red light, yet another
novelty. There isn't enough electricity in the North to power traffic
signals.</LD>
<TE>   One of a new breed of North Korean defectors, the 42-year-old Kim
settled in Bucheon a year and a half ago and brought his children south
last summer. Now they are working hard to assimilate, trying to lose
their telltale Northern accents and recover from what can only be
diagnosed as an epic case of culture shock.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, only a handful of North Koreans managed to escape to
the South. Most were border guards or members of the elite who had unique
opportunities to defect. That has changed as North Koreans find new
routes out, usually slipping first across the border into China and then
making their way to South Korea through third countries.</TE>
<TE>   A record 583 defectors came south last year, nearly double the number
who arrived in 2000, according to South Korean statistics. So far this
year, at least 88 have arrived--including a soldier who braved the land
mines of the demilitarized zone last month near where President Bush just
hours later urged that North Koreans be given their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Few observers are forecasting a mass exodus, but the numbers are
expected to climb as more North Koreans flee the chronic food shortages
and extraordinary isolation that make life so difficult at home.</TE>
<TE>   The trend puts the South Korean government in a delicate position. Any
perception that it is encouraging defectors would pique the North, which
classifies them as traitors, and further undermine South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung's efforts to maintain a dialogue with his nation's Communist
neighbor. Too many new arrivals also could breed resentment among his
people, who already fear that impoverished North Korea will one day
become an economic burden for them.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the government is well aware that a successful
resettlement effort would be a dress rehearsal for the possible
reunification of the Koreas after more than half a century of
estrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "If this relatively small group of North Korean defectors fails to
adjust, our prospects for reunification are gloomy," said Yoon In Jin, a
sociologist with Korea University who has written extensively about the
subject. "If they succeed in making a new life here, we have hope of
integrating. For that reason, we have to make every effort to help them
so we can learn from their trials and their errors."</TE>
<TE>   Extensive research is underway in South Korean academia about
resettling the defectors. The government Unification Ministry has studied
models ranging from Israel's airlift and resettlement of Yemeni Jews in
the 1940s and '50s to German reunification in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   It is generally assumed that integrating North and South Korea would
be even more difficult than Germany's costly effort. While West Germans
were about four times richer than East Germans just before reunification,
the income disparity between South and North Koreans is 16 to 1. South
Koreans throw away 4 million tons of food each year, more than North
Korea, which has about half the population, produces in food staples
annually, according to a report last week by the South Korean government.</TE>
<TE>   "They lived under a totalitarian system. They are very ignorant about
the outside world. They don't know how to open a bank account, how to
drive, how to use a mobile telephone," said Jo Sang Ho, an official with
the Assn. of Supporters for Defecting North Korean Residents, a
government-supported foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey published by the association in December, defectors
complained of difficulties finding jobs, combating prejudice and adapting
to the radically different life in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "They are like newborns. They have to forget everything they learned
in North Korea and start fresh,"' said Lee Jung Kuk, who defected in
1995. Now a successful businessman in Seoul, he volunteers to work with
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeon Woo Taek, a psychiatrist at Yonsei University who works with
defectors, said psychological problems handicap their adjustment to new
lives. They often suffer guilt over family members left behind and live
under assumed names in fear that the North Korean government might punish
their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their main obstacle to life in South Korea is that they are
suspicious and paranoid," said Jeon. "It makes it hard for them to get
close to South Koreans or to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Defectors receive government payments of roughly $28,000 to get
started. The amount used to be higher but was reduced because of the
growing number of new arrivals. For about two months, they are housed in
Hanawon, a resettlement center about 30 miles south of Seoul, which
serves a dual purpose: It is both a training facility and a detention
center while the defectors are investigated by intelligence services,
which try to determine if they are spies.</TE>
<TE>   Hanawon was opened in 1998, a year when there were only 71 defectors.
The increasing numbers are forcing the government to expand the center.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Kang Chul, who, like most defectors, changed his name when he
arrived, is a relative success story amid the new crop. He is one of the
few who can operate a car, having been a driver during his military
service in the North. He managed to bring his son, daughter and mother
south. Still, the family's travails illustrate how difficult the
adjustment is.</TE>
<TE>   They live in a government-subsidized, 13th-floor apartment crammed
with an impressive collection of donated appliances--computer,
television, VCR, stereo, rice cooker, water purifier--but so tiny that
there isn't enough room for a chair in the space that remains.</TE>
<TE>   With a thick accent and slightly mismatched clothing, Kim seems just
enough out of step to be spotted as a Northerner. He looks older than his
42 years, probably the result of poor nutrition and the stress of years
on the run.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Kim escaped from his home in North Hamgyong province by
swimming across the narrow Tumen River into China. He worked as a laborer
on Chinese farms, hoping to raise enough money to smuggle out his family.
But his wife died three months after his defection, succumbing to a
combination of malnutrition and tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   "She sacrificed herself for the children," he said. "She was living on
one meal a day so she could give them all the food, and she just wasted
away."</TE>
<TE>   Kim made it to South Korea two years ago and paid a smuggler to bring
out his mother and children last year. His son, now 15, and daughter, 12,
look younger than their ages; the poor Northern diet has left them
smaller than their South Korean peers. They also have been held back a
year in school because so much of their early education was devoted to
studying the works of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung and his son,
current leader Kim Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotionally, it has been a great shock for the children. They grew up
believing that Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il were heroes. Now they believe
they are tyrants," their father said.</TE>
<TE>   There is much about South Korea that the children like--mostly their
computer and the abundant food--but they complain of loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't that we were always hungry, I would rather be in the
North. The people are more human," said the boy.</TE>
<TE>   He identified himself by a nickname, Tae Hwan, because he wants his
Northern roots kept from classmates. "They are too shallow and frivolous.
They wouldn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Kim has found the adjustment difficult as well. He has tried various
businesses, including a matchmaking service. A writer by profession, he
also has tried selling essays and articles about his experiences in the
North, only to find that South Koreans aren't all that interested.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are indifferent mostly," he said. "I think they have lost
interest, or maybe they have become a little apprehensive that there will
be so many defectors that they become a burden on the economy."</TE>
<TE>   There are now close to 2,000 North Korean defectors living in South
Korea. Although a handful have had striking success writing books or
starting businesses, the vast majority struggle to reinvent themselves.
About 28% are unemployed, living entirely on government assistance.</TE>
<TE>   At a conference on North Korean human rights last month in Tokyo, Hong
Seong Phil, a professor at Ewha Woman's University in Seoul and an expert
on North Korea, predicted that about 1,000 defectors will come south this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can deter them from coming out in search of food and human
rights, and it is up to us to help them," Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost impossible for North Koreans to escape directly to the
South. Until the 22-year-old soldier appeared near the Dorasan train
station last month, no defector had made it across the demilitarized zone
since September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Escaping to China is easier, especially in winter when the Tumen River
is frozen over. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 North
Koreans have fled to China. But they live there illegally in fear of
being sent home, where they would face harsh treatment in labor camps or
even execution. China has a treaty with North Korea requiring that
defectors be deported if caught.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of those in China make it to South Korea, as the latter's
embassy in Beijing will not issue them visas for fear of endangering its
diplomatic relations with the Chinese government. Defectors must go to a
third country--often Mongolia--where the South Korean Embassy screens
them, grants visas and gives them plane tickets. All this is done in
great secrecy to avoid angering the North Korean government.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that every defector coming out was very special and
unique, people who had great bravery or luck, money or connections,
because it was so difficult to get out of North Korea," said Jeon, the
psychiatrist. "But now you are seeing ordinary people, families with
children."</TE>
<TE>   Jeon said the food situation has improved somewhat since the height of
the crisis, in 1997, but that the famine weakened social controls, making
it easier for North Koreans to leave home.</TE>
<TE>   "The society is crumbling. The old virtues of taking care of your
elderly relatives are disappearing because there is not enough food,"
agreed defector Kim Pyong Il, a 38-year-old doctor who lives in Seoul.
"People leave their children, their families."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Chul Young, a 29-year-old actor who defected last year after his
18-month-old son died during the famine, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "People are desperate," he said. "They feel they will die anyway if
they stay, so why not take the chance?"</TE>

<HD>'Angel of Death' Guilty Plea Expected</HD>
<DH>Courts: Therapist makes deal in exchange for life term, say
victims' families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efren Saldivar, the respiratory therapist who once told Glendale
police that he killed dozens of hospital patients with injections of
paralyzing drugs, is expected to plead guilty today to six murder counts
and other charges in a plea bargain that will spare him the death
penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Families of the victims were notified by authorities Monday night that
Saldivar, 32, had agreed to enter the plea this morning before Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito. He has been in custody for 14
months, charged with using the muscle relaxer Pavulon to kill the six
elderly patients at Glendale Adventist Medical Center in 1996 and 1997,
and with injecting the drug into another patient who survived.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced only that
there would be a hearing in the case in Ito's court, and that Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley would hold a news conference afterward on "a major
development in a pending murder case."</LD>
<TE>   Relatives of patients Saldivar was accused of killing said that they
were told that he would plead guilty to all the counts he was facing in
the "Angel of Death" case, and eventually be sentenced to life in prison
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   "It still seems so unreal," said Larry Schlegel, whose 77-year-old
mother, Eleanora, was found dead in her hospital bed Jan. 2, 1997. "It's
just that whole thing that 'it can never happen to you.' "</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing after all this time," said Michele Elmore, whose
mother, Jean Coyle, 64, went into respiratory arrest after Saldivar
allegedly gave her a potentially fatal dose of drugs a month later.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Verah Bradford, declined to
comment Monday night. A spokeswoman for the hospital also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Though Saldivar could conceivably change his mind at the last moment,
his expected plea would be the culmination of a four-year investigation
that began when the hospital received a phone tip that a respiratory
therapist may have "helped a patient die fast." Saldivar unexpectedly
confessed soon after, then recanted his confession, sparking the creation
of a police task force that eventually exhumed 20 bodies for testing.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar's plea still would not settle the issue of how many patients
may have been killed during his nine years as a hospital worker.
Investigators have said they came to believe that the toll was well over
100 during his time as a graveyard shift respiratory therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have done hundreds," said Glendale Police Sgt. John McKillop,
who headed the task force.</TE>
<TE>   If so, Saldivar would be among the most deadly serial killers in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   In his confession four years ago Monday--March 11, 1998--the pudgy
hospital worker told a polygraph examiner and Glendale Det. Will Currie
that he used lethal doses of drugs to kill "40-something" patients at
Glendale Adventist. Saldivar also said he had contributed to "anywhere
from 100 to 200" deaths, there and at other hospitals where he
moonlighted, by withholding medical care, such as by not providing CPR to
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar quickly repudiated that confession, however, saying he
fabricated it because he was depressed and wanted to die.</TE>
<TE>   In investigating whether patients had in fact been killed, the task
force discovered that more than 1,000 patients had died on Saldivar's
shifts at Glendale Adventist or within an hour of when he was on duty.
Police studied only the most recent deaths, however, on the theory that
those bodies would be most likely to still have traces of any drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities exhumed 20 bodies in 1999, but Saldivar was not arrested
until Jan. 9, 2001, when Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley announced that tests
conducted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory had found Pavulon in
six of them.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was also charged with illegal possession of a sedative,
Versed, which was found during a search of his Tujunga home. A subsequent
indictment added an attempted murder count alleging that he injected
Coyle, who was revived and is still alive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his 1998 confession, Saldivar maintained his innocence in
periodic public statements after he was identified as a suspect. He was
taken into custody after his confession, but released two days later when
prosecutors said they needed independent evidence to corroborate his
statements.</TE>
<TE>   When years passed without any charges, Saldivar and an attorney
representing him in a series of civil cases belittled the investigation.
His lawyer dismissed Saldivar's admissions to police as a "coerced false
confession."</TE>
<TE>   But when Saldivar was rearrested last year--while heading to a
construction job in the San Fernando Valley--authorities disclosed that
they had found Pavulon in the exhumed bodies.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, which suppresses natural breathing, is used by doctors and
nurses to keep patients from gagging when breathing tubes are inserted
into their throats. Respiratory therapists are not authorized to
administer Pavulon, which is so potent that it is among the mixture of
drugs used to execute condemned inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was charged with six counts of murder with two special
circumstances--multiple murder and poisoning--that could have landed him
on death row. In recent months, however, there were indications that
Bradford, his criminal attorney, might be negotiating a plea to spare him
that sentence. Several times, the filing of routine court papers was put
off after closed conferences between Bradford, prosecutors and Judge Ito.</TE>
<TE>   Though such a plea bargain would mean life in prison without parole,
Saldivar's brother told The Times last year that the former respiratory
therapist was adjusting well to confinement in a high-security wing of
Los Angeles County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you do enough time it becomes almost like home," Eddie Saldivar
said. "He's comfortable, it's relaxed. . . . The guards like him."</TE>
<TE>   In his 1998 confession, Saldivar said he was trying to put terminally
ill patients out of their misery and, while he felt "nagging guilt," that
emotion was "nothing compared to the anger, rage, of seeing somebody kept
alive in this position."</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed anger at families he thought kept their loved ones
alive too long, or who engaged in fraud to collect health benefits.
Saldivar said he targeted patients who had "do not resuscitate" orders on
their charts so their deaths would not raise suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators have questioned any suggestion that he only killed
patients who were going to die anyway, citing the case of Coyle. Five
years later, she is still alive in a nursing home and was one of the
witnesses called before the grand jury that indicted Saldivar in October.</TE>
<TE>   Coyle told The Times earlier that she remembered blacking out in the
hospital right after Saldivar came to her bedside. Coyle, who has
emphysema and other ailments, uses a wheelchair and has a tube in her
throat to help her breathe.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans of other such hospital murder investigations say such serial
killings are difficult to detect because the victims often are very sick,
and their deaths may appear to be natural.</TE>
<TE>   The police task force and Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie had built
the prosecution's case for trial on Saldivar's statements, the lab
findings and testimony from other respiratory therapists. Potential
witnesses included Ursula Anderson, who was often paired with Saldivar on
the overnight shift and admitted having an affair with him.</TE>
<TE>   According to records unsealed last year, Anderson said she once saw
Saldivar inject a drug into a patient's intravenous tube, "but could not
remember which patient it was," and another time stood outside a
patient's room while he went in "for the purpose of injecting the
patient."</TE>
<TE>   She also told police that Saldivar admitted injecting a muscle relaxer
into Coyle's intravenous line.</TE>

<HD>State Files Suit Against 4 Energy Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The California attorney general's office sued four major energy
companies for $150 million Monday, alleging that they broke contracts to
provide emergency power to the state's power grid operator and instead
sold the electricity on the lucrative spot market on thousands of
occasions.</LD>
<LD>   In many cases, the lawsuits allege, the state was forced to buy its
emergency electricity from the costly spot market, paying a second time
for the same power withheld in the first place by the energy companies.</LD>
<LD>   State officials said the suits demonstrate that big energy companies
began "gaming" the state's power grid operation within months of its
creation and within two years of the 1996 law that deregulated wholesale
energy markets and caused utilities to sell most of their generation
facilities.</LD>
<TE>   "These companies fattened their wallets at the expense of California
consumers and ratepayers," Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits filed in San Francisco County Superior Court allege that from
April 1998 to September 2000 Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy
Inc., Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. and various affiliates
flagrantly violated rules designed to ensure the reliable and safe
operation of the state's electricity transmission system. The suits seek
a total of $150 million from the four companies in restitution, penalties
and all profits from what Lockyer described as selling "the same
electrons twice."</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives declined comment until the suits could be
reviewed, but all said they have done nothing illegal or improper and
have complied with state rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the California energy crisis there have been numerous
state and federal investigations conducted which have resulted in no
evidence of illegal acts by Reliant," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman
for the Houston-based company. "At all times, Reliant has acted legally
and ethically in operating its plants to keep the lights on in
California, in accordance with the rules that California itself
established."</TE>
<TE>   The actions are the latest in the state's ongoing investigation into
alleged price gouging and other profiteering during the energy crisis.
California is seeking billions of dollars in refunds from generators for
spot market purchases. Recently state regulators asked the federal
government to void or modify $45 billion in long-term power contracts
signed by the state. And the attorney general sued Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co.'s parent two months ago, alleging that it illegally siphoned off more
than $4 billion from the utility and helped drive it to bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are numerous energy-related lawsuits in line," Lockyer said at
a news conference here Monday. "This is just one provable case where we
have the hard evidence to show they are double selling."</TE>
<TE>   The four lawsuits revolve around reserve generating capacity that the
California Independent System Operator, or ISO, purchased to ensure that
the state had adequate electricity during a major outage or some other
emergency. The generators were paid to keep the reserves on hand, and if
the grid operator needed them to balance supply and customer demand, the
companies were to be paid for the power itself.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits allege 10,000 violations of these rules by Dynegy, 4,000
each by Mirant and Reliant and 2,500 by Williams as the companies
collected millions of dollars for electricity generating capacity that
they failed to provide.</TE>
<TE>   "Reserves the ISO was counting on to keep the lights on . . . were
simply not there," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The power, state officials said, was sold on the volatile and
expensive hourly spot market, where generators could fetch a premium. And
in many instances, they said, the power was purchased for California.</TE>
<TE>   The practices of the generators not only cheated California utilities
and customers but also artificially drove up prices on the wholesale
market, Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's grid operator became aware of the problem by June 1998 and
issued notices to power providers warning them to meet their obligations.
But, Lockyer said, "The industry thumbed its nose at the ISO.
Unfortunately the ISO did not have the personnel or systems in place at
the time to effectively enforce its rules, and the industry knew it could
get away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy
Producers Assn., predicted that the lawsuits would go nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said efforts were underway to determine whether there are
additional violations.</TE>

<HD>Letterman Spurns ABC Offer, Vows to Remain Faithful to CBS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Letterman told his audience Monday that he would "like to
finish my career" at CBS, agreeing to a new contract with his current
network and leaving jilted suitor ABC measuring the damage that its bid
might have done to ABC News and "Nightline," the venerable program
Letterman would have displaced.</LD>
<LD>   After weighing the two offers, the 54-year-old host returned from a
vacation on the Caribbean island of St. Bart's and signed a new
three-year agreement with CBS, with an option for two additional years.</LD>
<LD>   ABC quickly announced in the wake of Letterman's decision that
"Nightline" will remain in its current time slot, opposite Letterman's
program and "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" on NBC. Letterman detailed
his decision in a monologue during his show's taping in New York Monday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   While the deal appears to reinforce late-night television's status
quo, the reality is that ABC's unsuccessful grab for Letterman seems
likely to have long-term repercussions for all of the principal players
while jump-starting what promises to be an ongoing debate about the
future of network news.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman's deal will reportedly pay him about $31.5 million annually,
up from the $30 million he had made in the last year of his previous
pact. But the key provision involved written guarantees that CBS' parent
company, Viacom, will bring its vast resources to bear in promoting his
late-night program, which continues to trail "The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno" in the ratings, a source of frustration to the mercurial host.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's attempt to land Letterman leaked out 11 days ago and fueled a
spate of stories about the diminished commitment to news by companies
that control the major television networks, foremost among them the Walt
Disney Co., which owns ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to that criticism, ABC defended its interest in Letterman
in a statement issued Monday. "In today's competitive environment, it is
incumbent upon us to explore all programming options, and 'The Late Show
With David Letterman' was an opportunity that ABC felt compelled to
pursue," the network said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Walt Disney Co. said Chairman Michael Eisner and
President Robert Iger were unavailable for comment. Iger and Eisner
reportedly spearheaded the pursuit of Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel, who had limited his public comments to
an opinion piece for the New York Times, issued a pointed statement
Monday in which he and his producers chided Disney, saying that
"intentionally or not, collateral damage has been done" to ABC News and
that it would be unreasonable to expect the show's staff to continue "in
a climate of ongoing uncertainty. There must be a great many talented
comedians who would welcome the opportunity to take over the 'Nightline'
time slot. Our hope is that Disney will send a clear and unmistakable
signal . . . that 'Nightline' can count on serious corporate backing."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Dixon, an analyst with UBS Warburg, echoed Koppel's point,
observing that while Disney's strategy to bring Letterman to ABC had "an
enormous amount of merit, the issue was how it was executed. . . . Iger
and Eisner did not manage the process well."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Dixon said, Iger and company must "rebuild credibility with the
senior news correspondents" at ABC.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, high-profile ABC News personnel--including Barbara
Walters and Sam Donaldson--have publicly expressed outrage over what they
saw as an obvious slight to "Nightline" and its anchor, Koppel, who has
hosted the prestigious news program for more than 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman's decision to remain at CBS is only the latest in a series
of setbacks at ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The network's prime-time ratings have dropped dramatically this
season, as viewing of the quiz-show franchise "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" sank faster than officials anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Letterman's courtship represents only the latest public
relations mess involving a perceived snub of key talent.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall, network officials angered "Millionaire" host Regis
Philbin by suggesting they might cancel the fading quiz show without
informing him. The network also irked Walters by temporarily yanking her
news program, "20/20," from the Friday time period it had occupied for
more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that ABC News President David Westin was blindsided by the
Letterman negotiations has also fueled a sense that news is not a
priority for Disney as it seeks to revive the network.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders at CBS say they had been generally optimistic Letterman would
stay, despite what are perceived to have been frayed relations between
the host and CBS Television President Leslie Moonves.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of, 'If I'm not appreciated, I should make a move,' "
said Lee Gabler, co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, which represents
Letterman. "He wanted to be with a network that cared about his show as
much as he did. . . . CBS stepped up."</TE>
<TE>   Letterman considered ABC's overture only after CBS balked at meeting
certain demands during an exclusive negotiating period, among them the
right to control the hour he currently occupies for 10 years after he
quits the program.</TE>
<TE>   While that concession was not met, CBS did agree contractually to
promote "Late Show" using Viacom's far-flung assets, which include MTV,
VH1, an outdoor advertising company and more than 180 radio stations in
major cities across the United States--all outlets that offer the means
to reach the young-adult audience most advertisers crave.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the publicity has drawn attention to his
program--something Letterman no doubt contributed to by making his
announcement on the air Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On NBC, meanwhile, Leno offered his own joke about Letterman's new
deal, saying that Disney pursued Letterman before the studio "realized
they already had a guy working there named 'Grumpy.' "</TE>

Eller contributed to this story.</TE>

<HD>Fighting for Students, Japan's Colleges Start to Learn Marketing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>When Takahiko Someya first became admissions officer at Tokyo's
private Toyo University, the position was about as demanding as the
proverbial Maytag repairman's job. Applications poured in, high schools
begged him to take their graduates, and selecting an incoming class was a
simple case of comparing test scores. His ample free time was filled with
golf, tennis, diving and hang gliding.</LD>
<LD>   A decade later, Someya is up at 5 a.m., often works until midnight and
visits dozens of parent-teacher meetings and more than 400 high schools
and cram schools each year.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are very tough out there," he said. "I rarely find time to
relax even on Sundays."</LD>
<TE>   Someya isn't alone. After decades of relative ease, Japan's private
universities are finding themselves in a pitched battle for survival amid
declining subsidies, downward tuition pressure and demographics that are
reducing the pool of applicants. By some estimates, 200 of Japan's 497
technical, two- and four-year private colleges could fold by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is spurring creativity. Marketing is suddenly on the
radar screen. Some institutions are offering a free computer to each
student, as well as complimentary taxi service, tuition discounts,
friendship trinkets and cutesy branding. Others use bus ads, overnight
"open campus" tryouts, slick videos, Christmas cards and recruitment
cruises. Kure University is using Space Battleship Yamato animation
characters. Hiroshima Women's University hands out pink date books.</TE>
<TE>   "Our brochures are now brighter, use better paper, have more photos
and use cartoon characters," Someya said. "Many high school students are
so used to reading comic books and have problems with more difficult
reading."</TE>
<TE>   Most striking to some is the stark change in attitude at once-arrogant
universities. "Even high-and-mighty professors come begging for students
now," said Fumio Kawamura, a teacher at Tokyo Industrial High School. "In
the past, even visiting would have been unthinkable."</TE>
<TE>   Competition almost certainly will get tougher. The number of
18-year-olds in Japan has declined 25% since 1992 to 1.5 million, and is
expected to fall an additional 20% before leveling off around 2009,
according to the Education Ministry. Even so, an average of 10 new
institutions have opened each year in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The government is upping the ante by cutting subsidies--which on
average constitute 12% of a private university's operating budget--when
enrollment dips below 50% of capacity. It also has threatened to channel
a disproportionate share of its support to 30 top public and private
schools, squeezing the laggards.</TE>
<TE>   As private universities struggle, public relations and marketing
budgets balloon. Location now matters: As city schools tout their links
with major companies, outlying schools try to move into the city, and
rural institutions suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other private university in the same area is now a rival," said
Kazuyuki Kitamura, director of the Research Institute for Independent
Higher Education.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are racing to upgrade, as two-year colleges try to become
four-year colleges, which in turn seek to become full-fledged
universities. Institutions allow online applications, offer admission
tests at more convenient sites and place emphasis on interviews, essays
and club memberships over test scores.</TE>
<TE>   As the pool of applicants declines, schools are looking to older,
part-time and foreign students. Faced with bankruptcy, Sakata Junior
College recruited Chinese students--only to come under scrutiny when many
were reported skipping classes to work illegally in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Big names also are being called on to lure applicants. Takushoku
University created a stir when it invited former Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori as a guest lecturer. Waseda University has hired former
South Korean President Kim Young Sam to lecture on international
politics, while Hakodate University is offering up comedian Sanshi
Katsura for a "business of laughter" course.</TE>
<TE>   "The student is king, and we need to do whatever fun and amusing
things it takes to meet their needs," said Hakushi Kawamura, chief of
Teikyo University. "We're becoming a lot like convenience stores."</TE>
<TE>   Finding money is a constant headache, particularly for mid- and
lower-tier schools. Raising fees is difficult given deflation, a
prolonged recession and already high tuition. Competition has prompted
some institutions to cut charges by 10% or more. On average, Japanese
students pay $9,800 a year at private schools and $6,000 at public
institutions, excluding room and board.</TE>
<TE>   The hard times have forced many to outsource recruiting, accounting
and guard duties, hire more part-time professors, introduce early
retirement and cut back on tenure. And some institutions have opened side
businesses, including driving schools, wedding halls, hotels, employment
agencies and real estate brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Overriding the change is concern in Japan that its education system is
out of step as it churns out students who are often more suited to old
assembly-line jobs than future creative design positions. Japan's higher
education system was deemed the least competitive of 49 nations in a 2001
survey by Switzerland's International Institute for Management
Development.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss of competitiveness in higher education is one of Japan's
most serious problems," said Yoshimasa Nishimura, a management professor
at Tokyo's Waseda University. "We've waited much too long to deal with
this problem."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's pride has been hurt by large numbers of Japanese going to
U.S. universities for advanced degrees--with relatively few students
heading the other way. Many Japanese end up staying in U.S. labs, raising
fears of a brain drain.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many of the traits arguably needed to spur creativity--a
willingness to question authority and challenge mediocrity--are seen as a
threat to Japan's social fabric and emphasis on group harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan's a country that thinks equality and fairness is central, which
helped our development," said Akira Ishikawa, director general of the
Education Ministry. "Now we need to change this for the next stage."</TE>
<TE>   Many are resisting that change. Tradition-bound institutions still
give relatively little power to university presidents and enormous clout
to professors, who are cited in surveys by 30% of schools as major
roadblocks to reform.</TE>
<TE>   Others worry that higher education is being degraded by pandering to
student tastes. "I doubt over the long run this will succeed in
attracting students," said Satoshi Ajisaka of Obunsha Group's Education
Information Division, a consultancy.</TE>
<TE>   Although consolidation has been slow, a government survey found that
even nearly 40% of public universities were considering mergers.</TE>
<TE>   Saitama University alumnus Atsushi Chikamatsu, a 28-year-old employee
at Tokyo Electric Power, is saddened by the idea that his alma mater's
identity could be undermined by a proposed merger with Gunma University.
But others are taking it all in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "My company was merged and renamed, and my city recently merged and
disappeared as well," said Saitama alumnus Katsuhisa Naito, a 60-year-old
retiree. "I guess it can't be helped."</TE>

<HD>Extradition of Drug Cartel Boss May Take Years</HD>
<DH>Justice: Mexican officials say Benjamin Arellano Felix will
probably face trial at home before any hand-over to the United States is
considered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Mexican officials cautioned Monday that any move to extradite
notorious Tijuana drug cartel chief Benjamin Arellano Felix to face
justice in the United States could take months, if not years.</LD>
<LD>   Arellano Felix, one of the most wanted men on both sides of the
border, was captured over the weekend in an operation that one
high-ranking U.S. official called a "sea change" marking Mexico's more
aggressive tactics against drug traffickers who until recently operated
with impunity.</LD>
<LD>   Another "big fish"--Osiel Cardenas, head of the so-called Gulf
Cartel--is in the cross hairs of Mexican police and may soon be arrested,
said the U.S. official, who is closely connected to the drug fight.
Cardenas' cartel is accused of trafficking cocaine and assaulting U.S.
federal agents in the state of Tamaulipas near the Texas border.</LD>
<TE>   "We may be seeing the last days of some untouchables," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest of Arellano Felix has put President Vicente Fox in a strong
position in advance of next week's talks with President Bush in
Monterrey, Mexico, Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda said Monday.
Immigration, border infrastructure, security and water issues will be on
the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Arellano Felix, 49, whose drug mafia is responsible for an estimated
one-quarter or more of the cocaine entering the United States from
Mexico, was arrested by army units early Saturday outside Puebla, east of
Mexico City, after having eluded capture for the better part of a decade.
No shots were fired, and he is now in the maximum-security La Palma
prison near the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Mexican Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha declared
that Benjamin's brother, Ramon Arellano Felix, 37, the cartel's chief
enforcer, died in a Feb. 10 police shootout in Mazatlan. DNA tests are
pending to confirm the death.</TE>
<TE>   The capture of one Arellano Felix brother and the apparent death of
another has left the cartel "dismantled," Macedo told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials said they would press
for the extradition of Benjamin Arellano Felix to face trafficking
charges in the United States. Castaneda told reporters Monday that
extradition is not guaranteed but subject to judicial recommendation. He
added, however, that the Mexican government had agreed to numerous
extradition requests in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican law forbids extradition of Mexican nationals who would face
either a life sentence or the death penalty in a foreign court. But U.S.
authorities have gotten around this restriction by brokering deals in
which traffickers would be convicted of consecutive terms of 20 years or
more.</TE>
<TE>   Before extradition is considered, Arellano Felix would probably face
prosecution in Mexico, Castaneda said. The process could take years; the
foreign minister's chief of staff, Arturo Sarukhan Casamitjana, noted
that even "small trials" of lesser drug traffickers can last 18 months in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on both sides of the border, Arellano Felix faces what
could amount to life in prison. After his Mexican trial, he could "go to
the United States for his trial there, come back to serve his sentence
here, and then be sent back to the United States to prison," Castaneda
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arellano Felix had been living in a quiet Puebla suburb under a false
name since August, when he paid $250,000 for a walled house. Neighbors,
including executives at the nearby Volkswagen factory, described him as
quiet.</TE>
<TE>   The high-ranking U.S. government official, who asked that his name not
be used, said Mexican authorities acted on their own to capture Arellano
Felix, with minimal help from U.S. authorities. He lauded the new spirit
of cooperation between the United States and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "This ought to send shock waves through the whole criminal element in
Mexico that the rules have changed, that the tolerance that allowed these
guys to go free doesn't exist anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-Mexico cooperation has been credited for the capture last year of
two figures accused of trafficking narcotics through the Yucatan
Peninsula: Mario Villanueva, the ex-governor of Quintana Roo state, and
his alleged conspirator Alcides Ramon Magana, known as "El Metro."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. official pointed to last fall's Operation Landslide, which
broke up a heroin-smuggling ring based in Michoacan state and led to
dozens of arrests in California and Mexico, as evidence of a new trust
between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Fox, had we given that information to Mexicans, we might have
seen it splashed in newspapers the next day," but no one would have been
arrested, he said.</TE>

<HD>Chaotic Voting Closes in Zimbabwe</HD>
<DH>Africa: Court rejects opposition's request for another extension.
Results possible today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The government closed the polls Monday in this country's chaotic
presidential election, and a high court judge later rejected the main
opposition party's petition to extend voting to a fourth day.</LD>
<LD>   The election, originally scheduled to be held Saturday and Sunday, had
been extended one day by court order after long lines and slow processing
at many polling stations prevented thousands of people from casting
ballots over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Though the order called for the vote to be continued nationwide, the
government opened polls only here in the capital and in a nearby township
and did so "under protest," Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told state
television. Both areas are considered strongholds of the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change.</LD>
<TE>   However, when crowds of voters returned to polling stations in Harare
early Monday, they found that many would not open until afternoon and
some not at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Polling was supposed to take place throughout the nation and begin at
7 a.m.," MDC spokesman Learnmore Jongwe said. "There are thousands of
people who would not have had the opportunity to vote."</TE>
<TE>   The election, the most contentious in the nation's history, pitted
President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front against MDC challenger Morgan Tsvangirai.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition accused Mugabe of intentionally slowing the voting
process to rig the results, a charge the government denied.</TE>
<TE>   "If those thousands of people are not allowed to vote, this is a
stillborn election," Tsvangirai told reporters at a crowded news
conference Monday. "The MDC will not be part of an illegitimate process
to try to disenfranchise people."</TE>
<TE>Tsvangirai Asks for Restraint</TE>
<TE>   State radio reported that election results would not be known before
late today or Wednesday. Analysts warned of widespread unrest if MDC
voters concluded that the election was fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai called for restraint from his supporters despite the arrest
Monday of Welshman Ncube, his party's secretary-general, for reasons that
remained unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "Restrain yourselves so you do not allow [the government's] sinister
plans to succeed," he said in a statement. "As you wait for the results,
do not succumb to their provocative traps. I know they are trying very
hard to provoke you."</TE>
<TE>   The government has accused Tsvangirai, Ncube and another MDC official
of trying to assassinate the 78-year-old president. They deny the
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai, 50, who poses the first real challenge to Mugabe's 22-year
rule, alluded to his own life possibly being in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "President Mugabe and his colleagues are afraid of the people, and we
have heard they may do anything to kill the messenger," Tsvangirai said.
"If they do, [the people] must stay strong and carry on the work we began
together."</TE>
<TE>   The run-up to the election was marred by violence, with the opposition
charging that pro-government militants killed at least 107 of its
supporters during the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The government reported that 2.7 million of the nation's 5.6 million
registered voters, or about 48%, had gone to the polls by Sunday.
Thousands more sought the chance Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to add more hours, because we are not going to leave
without voting," Tawanda Tembo, a 30-year-old businessman, said early
Monday afternoon before the polls were closed. He had stood in line a
total of 18 hours over the first two days of voting without success.
"It's my right to vote."</TE>
<TE>4 American Diplomats Held</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Harare reported that police
detained four American diplomats for reasons that were unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats were on their way back to the capital from the town of
Chinhoyi, about 70 miles northwest of Harare. They were stopped at a
police roadblock and told to go to a police station, where they were held
for about five hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been given a satisfactory reason for their detention,"
said Bruce Wharton, an embassy spokesman. "We view that as a clear
violation of diplomatic norms, and we are quite concerned about it."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Americans were accredited election observers. The other two
were diplomats with the U.S. mission here.</TE>
<TE>   Police were unavailable to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial master, have
been outspoken critics of Mugabe's rule. His loyalists have accused the
two Western nations of setting the stage for a coup if the president is
reelected.</TE>
<TE>   Wharton called the charge "ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>Parents Drop Suit Against Sheriff's Dept. in Teen's Train
Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a 16-year-old Moorpark boy who was struck and killed
by a train two years ago while running from police have dropped a
wrongful-death lawsuit against the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Drew Diederich sued the agency and its officers
last year for allegedly violating their son's civil rights.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit claimed that deputies taunted the teenager while he
was under the influence of a hallucinogen and allowed him to run into
a dangerous area where he was hit by a train.</LD>
<TE>   But a U.S. District Court judge threw out the case after ruling
that even if Deputies Paul Ferruzza and Jeffrey Lawrence provoked
Drew, such conduct does not amount to a constitutional violation of
his civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Drew's parents then brought a wrongful-death lawsuit in Ventura
County Superior Court, which was dismissed Monday at the plaintiffs'
request.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Philip Erickson, who represented the department and its
officers, said he wasn't certain why the parents dropped the case,
but the deputies feel vindicated. A continuation school student, Drew
was one of four teens stopped by police on the night of May 23, 2000,
in Moorpark. He died after jumping a fence onto railroad tracks and
being hit by an oncoming train.</TE>

<HD>School Tribute Honors Sept. 11 Victims</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Oxnard students dedicate a monument that turned
out to be far grander than expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six months to the day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Oxnard
students dedicated a memorial Monday honoring the victims, including
eight people who were en route to the Channel Islands when their
hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the fund-raising efforts of students and staff members,
the solemn monument erected in the lunch yard at Robert J. Frank
Intermediate School turned out to be a grander affair than anyone
anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   It features a pair of black granite "towers" representing the
fallen World Trade Center, bright red and blue benches, and a broad
tipuana tree, all arranged inside a Pentagon-shaped expanse of
concrete.</LD>
<TE>   During a brief dedication ceremony attended by honor students,
donors, flag-bearing Shriners and Oxnard political and education
leaders, Principal Ron D'Incau explained the significance behind the
structure's design. Noting that the tired-looking "tipu" tree was in
shock from being transplanted, "like our country [was] in shock on
Sept. 11," D'Incau told the audience not to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "Its branches are going to spread out, and it will protect those
of you sitting on the benches. It will protect the World Trade Center
towers. It will come back, as we as a nation will," D'Incau said.</TE>
<TE>   As with many of the tributes around the nation since Sept. 11, the
Frank school memorial stemmed from a personal connection to people
who lost their lives in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Two National Geographic staff members, as well as three
11-year-old students and three teachers from Washington, D.C., were
among those killed aboard American Airlines Flight 77. All were on
their way to an expedition on Santa Cruz Island, a trip that was
supposed to include participants from Frank and two other Oxnard
middle schools.</TE>
<TE>   At a pre-dedication assembly Monday morning for the school's 1,126
seventh- and eighth-graders, Learning Director Elaine Daughtery, who
had served as National Geographic's local contact for the trip,
vividly recalled the tense hours she spent on Sept. 11 awaiting word
on the fate of the island-bound travelers.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to know they were all on that hijacked plane--that none
of them were coming to California," she said. "We would never meet
them."</TE>
<TE>   Armay Roque, a Frank eighth-grader who was selected as her
school's student representative on the aborted field trip, read a
series of haiku poems she wrote within days of the attacks. National
Geographic has rescheduled the expedition for April 3-5, although no
Washington-area students or teachers will be making the trip. Armay,
however, who turned 14 on Monday, is already preparing for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more of an obligation to take part, given the fact that
I'm lucky I will still be able to do it, while the people from
Washington, D.C., won't be going," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the school's Young Poets club recited an elegy written
by teacher Dori Maria that attempted to put a human face on the crash
of Flight 77. Filled with more than 1,000 squirmy adolescents, the
normally noisy school gymnasium was silent as the students took turns
reading.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial was built with $1,000 in student-raised donations
that went toward the purchase of the tree, as well as $15,000 worth
of materials, labor and cash contributions from members of Oxnard's
construction industry.</TE>
<TE>   John Labriola, who managed the project on behalf of Martinez
Architects, described the structure as a collaborative effort. Its
chief design was largely suggested by the school's staff, then
refined by his firm, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a privilege to participate, even though I would
rather it didn't have to be built," Labriola said.</TE>

<HD>County Budget Woes May Mean Layoffs</HD>
<DH>Finance: Though officials have narrowed the gap somewhat,
they still must make up for a $17.6-million shortfall in the general
fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County government has pared back a projected budget shortfall
but is facing more painful cuts--and the possibility of layoffs--in
the coming fiscal year, county officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Department managers have been given cost-cutting targets intended
to erase a $17.6-million budget shortfall looming in the 2002-03
budget. Earlier projections of a $22-million funding gap were lowered
last month when the county Board of Supervisors cut 44 vacant
positions.</LD>
<LD>   But much more belt-tightening is needed before the budget is
balanced, warned County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston in a report
that will be presented to supervisors at their meeting today.</LD>
<TE>   "Things continue to be uncertain and the economic news is not
good," Johnston said in an interview. "We have to do what we have to
do to reach a balanced budget, and that is going to be hard for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Public safety departments would be shielded from the deepest
reductions under Johnston's proposed adjustments. But for the first
time in a decade, the sheriff, district attorney, public defender and
probation chief would receive only a minimum increase, 2.1%, over
current funding. In recent years, the agencies' annual increases have
ranged between 7% and 10%.</TE>
<TE>   With the more modest hike, and falling revenue from a special
sales tax funneled to public safety agencies, the Sheriff's
Department must cut $3 million from its budget. As a result, it will
probably be forced to trim jobs and services, Sheriff Bob Brooks
said.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly where the cuts will be made is not certain, Brooks said.
He is considering permanently deleting a handful of patrol and jail
jobs or shuttering a women's jail near Oak View. A prime
consideration will be making the cuts in a way that does not affect
the public, the sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do believe it is a very real problem for the CEO and the
board," Brooks said. "So we are not contesting that we should be part
of the solution."</TE>
<TE>   Other programs, already cut to the bone, may be more difficult to
reduce further. Although the sprawling Health Care Agency would see a
slight increase in overall revenue, contributions from the general
fund are expected to fall by nearly 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Building and maintenance budgets would also be slashed, and the
county's contingency fund trimmed to a bare minimum of $2 million,
said Bert Bigler, chief deputy administrative officer, who helped
prepare the budget report.</TE>
<TE>   Layoffs remain a possibility, especially if the state Legislature
decides to cut funding to counties as it struggles to close its own
$12-billion budget hole, Bigler said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a lot of vacant positions that could be closed,"
Bigler said. "But it is certainly possible that there could be some
layoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the county's total revenues are expected to grow by 4.4%
for the fiscal year that begins July 1. But the cost of running the
7,200-worker government is outstripping revenue growth, Johnston
said.</TE>
<TE>   That chronic problem has been masked in recent years by dipping
into year-end reserves. But that practice is financially unsound
because the reserves will eventually run out, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we've used the money left over at the end of the year,
and it's just shrunk and shrunk. Last year it was $10 million, and
this year it's down to just a couple of million dollars," he said.
"What we really need to do is live within our means."</TE>

<HD>Trial Ordered in Fatal Stabbing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge rejects man's claim that he acted in
self-defense when he attacked three men at a Simi party, killing one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rejecting claims of self-defense, a judge ordered a Ventura man
Monday to stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges for
stabbing three men at a party last fall in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Winters, 19, conceded during a two-day preliminary hearing
that he stabbed the three victims with a pocketknife; one of them
died. But his attorney argued that Winters acted in self-defense
after a group of drunk party-goers jumped him.</LD>
<LD>   "They accosted him, they were on him, and it was only at that time
that he came up swinging with a knife," said Deputy Public Defender
Randy Tucker, arguing that the charges should be reduced.</LD>
<TE>   Tucker cited the testimony of three defense witnesses who said
they saw one of the victims push Winters before the knife came out.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tragedy," Tucker said. "But what Mr. Winters did there
was not murder."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley, in ordering the
trial, ruled that prosecutors presented credible evidence to show
that a fight had occurred and that Winters used unreasonable, deadly
force.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the victim who was killed, two others were
seriously injured in the Oct. 13, 2001, brawl.</TE>
<TE>   The stabbings occurred about 10 minutes after Winters showed up at
a Breton Avenue residence with friends and began arguing with another
party-goer, Simi Valley Police Det. Jay Carrott testified last week.</TE>
<TE>   As Ryan Kramer and Mike Ponticelli tried to escort Winters from
the house, Kramer tripped on a step in the garage, and he and Winters
fell to the ground, Carrott testified.</TE>
<TE>   Based on his interviews, the detective added, Winters lunged at
the victims with an opened knife and began swinging it "like a
madman," cutting Kramer and Ponticelli, who recovered from their
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   But their friend Randy Lucero, 21, died after Winters buried the
3-inch blade in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Winters, who did not know the victims, fled the scene and turned
himself in to police the next day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the charges related to the stabbings, Winters is
accused of stealing beer from a convenience store on the way to the
party that evening.</TE>
<TE>   He remains held in lieu of $1-million bail.</TE>

<HD>Suit Calls Prison Haircutting Unsanitary</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Activists claim that use of unsterilized
instruments has exposed thousands of inmates to HIV and hepatitis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AIDS activists supported by South Los Angeles Rep. Maxine Waters
announced Monday the filing of a class-action lawsuit asking that
federal courts prohibit California prisons from cutting inmates' hair
with unsterilized clippers.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in the Crenshaw district, a dozen
representatives of various organizations said they believe thousands
of prisoners have been exposed to HIV or hepatitis from unsanitary
haircutting practices.</LD>
<LD>   A former inmate who is a South Los Angeles minister, James Stern,
said he had earlier filed a suit in the matter.</LD>
<TE>   Stern said that while serving time in a state facility in Delano
for passing bad checks, he had been placed in solitary confinement
for six months for refusing a haircut after observing some other
inmates with bleeding scalps after getting haircuts with unsterilized
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Although he finally submitted to getting haircuts, he said he had
not contracted either disease, but did come down with a less serious
skin condition.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state's Corrections Department, Russ
Heimerich, said the agency has adopted procedures recommended by the
state Bureau of Barbering and Cosmetology that require private
barbers to sterilize implements between customers.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich said, "We don't believe that the risk of getting AIDS or
hepatitis from a haircut in prison is any greater than anywhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   Saying he doubted that Stern would have been subject to solitary
confinement for refusing a haircut, the prisons spokesman also said
that the fact that the former inmate did not contract either HIV or
hepatitis weakens his suit.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the courts have generally ruled there are only limited
instances in which you can sue for a possible risk," Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Wilson, a lawyer representing those seeking the
class-action injunction, said depositions would be taken to prove
there is a danger. Rick Lopes, a spokesman for the Barbering and
Cosmetology bureau, said that a state law exempts the prison system
from regulations the bureau sets, but that it could choose to follow
them.</TE>
<TE>   Waters said a coalition of AIDS organizations became aware of
Stern's suit and decided to back it by filing the class action.</TE>
<TE>   HIV and hepatitis could be transmitted by blood on haircutting
instruments, said Paul Simon, a physician with the L.A. County
Department of Health Services. He said he had not heard of any such
cases in this country.</TE>

<HD>Florida Workers Bring Protest to Taco Bell's Door</HD>
<DH>Labor: Tomato field hands make the trek to Irvine seeking
support for better wages from their employer, whose goods end up in
the chain's outlets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS and MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cross-country caravan of Florida tomato field workers upset with
Taco Bell, a major tomato buyer, for not helping in their struggle
for better wages arrived at its destination Monday: Taco Bell
corporate headquarters in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The farm workers were greeted enthusiastically by local supporters
in a street rally outside the 12-story, glass-walled headquarters
building. Their reception by Taco Bell officials was cordial but far
less than what the visitors had hoped it would be.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, Taco Bell told them it wasn't the company's fight.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a labor dispute between the workers and their employer,
the Six L Packing Co.," said Jonathan Blum, senior vice president for
public affairs for Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., Taco Bell's parent
company. "We don't intervene in any company's labor dispute."</TE>
<TE>   The workers and church officials supporting them had a different
view.</TE>
<TE>   "Taco Bell just can't say, 'It's not our issue.' It's certainly an
issue to their customers," said the Rev. Noelle Damico of the
Washington, D.C.-based United Church of Christ's National Office for
Justice and Peace.</TE>
<TE>   Others have succeeded recently in pushing fast-food companies to
make changes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals pressured
McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's to strengthen supervision of
their suppliers to ensure better treatment of cows and chickens
before and during slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   The two-bus caravan left Florida three weeks ago and stopped at
several cities where it has support groups. Monday, they were greeted
by nearly 500 supporters at Santa Ana Memorial Park. With a police
escort, the crowd walked behind a flatbed truck, singing and chanting
slogans during the two-mile trek from Santa Ana to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The 65 Florida workers from the caravan led the parade. For
Hernael Alvarado, who has picked tomatoes for 10 years, it was a
special way to spend his 40th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "The work is hard, the day is long," he said, "all for 40 cents a
bucket."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarado wore a cardboard hat with the image of a tomato, and
banged a stick against the bottom of a plastic tomato bucket.</TE>
<TE>   The pickers and packers are part of the Coalition of Immokalee
Workers, which organized the caravan. Lucas Benitez, an organizer,
said workers are paid 40 cents for each 30-gallon bucket. Few workers
can pick more than 150 buckets a day, which is $60 a day. Florida
supplies most of the nation's tomatoes during the winter. The state's
tomato industry has a crop value of about $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among those walking with the workers were members of Local Union
652, a construction laborers' union.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our members know what it's like to work for the kind of
wages these farm workers have to feed their families on," said Rudy
Ruvalcava, union spokesman. "We just want to show our support."</TE>
<TE>   At Taco Bell, 80 security guards hired for the day ringed the
headquarters grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We did that at the police's suggestion," Tricon's Blum said. "Our
primary objective was just to make sure that no one got hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The farm workers and their supporters are trying to raise public
awareness for their national boycott of Taco Bell's 7,000 fast-food
restaurants. The boycott was a factor in Taco Bell's recent decision
to meet with Six L to discuss the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We only told the packing company that because it was affecting
our company, we hoped it would do what it could to resolve the labor
issue," Blum said. "But we are not intervening."</TE>
<TE>   Blum said Taco Bell does not buy tomatoes from Six L but from a
broker, which purchases from several companies, including Six L.</TE>
<TE>   Taco Bell did meet with organizers of Monday's rally, but Blum
said it was a courtesy visit because the group had come all the way
from Florida.</TE>

<HD>Girl's Body Too Decomposed to Determine Cause of Her Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: At a hearing, official says Danielle van Dam
probably was killed soon after being abducted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Danielle van Dam's body was too decomposed to allow investigators to
determine how she died, the county's medical examiner testified
Monday in a preliminary hearing for the neighbor accused of
kidnapping and killing the 7-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Brian Blackbourne said he initially identified the body by a
pair of Mickey Mouse earrings that her parents said were Danielle's.
The body was found lying beneath a tree along a rural road Feb. 27.</LD>
<LD>   Blackbourne said the body's deterioration was "consistent" with
the theory that she was killed soon after being kidnapped from her
bedroom on Feb. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Asked by Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek if there was any evidence
to suggest Danielle had been strangled, Blackbourne said that he
found none but that he could not rule out the possibility that she
was suffocated.</TE>
<TE>   In response to another question by Dusek, Blackbourne said the
body had deteriorated too much for him to determine if she had been
sexually assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing additional evidence presented by prosecutors and
rebuttal by the defense attorneys, Superior Court Judge H. Ronald
Domnitz will determine if the evidence is sufficient to order David
Westerfield to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have filed murder, kidnapping and child pornography
charges against Westerfield, 50, a self-employed engineer who lived
two doors from Damon and Brenda van Dam and their three children in
the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield trembled slightly as prosecution witnesses began to
describe how he became the chief suspect within days of Danielle's
disappearance. The Van Dams did not attend the all-day session.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference after Westerfield was arrested Feb. 22,
police asserted that Danielle's blood was found in his recreational
vehicle and on a piece of his clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Hoeffs, a neighbor, testified that the night Danielle
disappeared, Westerfield closed the blinds in his home and left a
backyard light on. Both things were unusual, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoeffs, a dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol, said she
noticed the blinds and light when she got up at 2 a.m. to feed her
baby.</TE>
<TE>   She said it was the first time during the several years she has
lived directly behind Westerfield that she had noticed his lights on
at night and his blinds all drawn.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorney, Steven Feldman, one of the city's top
criminal defense attorneys, sharply questioned the thoroughness of
the police investigation.</TE>
<TE>   From the lead investigator, Lt. Jim Collins, he drew a concession
that Collins had not been aware for weeks that bloodstains had been
found by evidence technicians inside the Van Dam home. Feldman also
asserted that even as police were searching the home for clues, Damon
van Dam vacuumed part of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Van Dam vacuumed up trace evidence that your department might
have been interested in, right?" Feldman asked.</TE>
<TE>   Collins agreed.</TE>
<TE>   No further evidence has yet been presented about the bloodstains.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Johnny Keene said he became suspicious of Westerfield when he
interviewed him Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield was sweating profusely and was "overly cooperative"
when police searched his house, Keene said.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically when we search people's houses, they don't point out
areas they think we should look at," said Keene, a 16-year veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Keene added that while searching Westerfield's recreational
vehicle, detectives smelled a strong odor of bleach, a cleaning
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Keene said he saw "numerous small scratches" on Westerfield's
hands and forearms. Looking at a picture taken of Westerfield's arms,
Keene counted 13 scratches.</TE>
<TE>   During their initial conversations, Westerfield told Keene,
according to the detective, that he had scratched his hands trying to
move his RV out of desert sand where it had gotten stuck.</TE>
<TE>   When the hearing resumes, prosecutors say they will present
evidence from DNA experts, including Deputy Dist. Atty. Woody Clarke,
who testified about DNA in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.</TE>

<HD>Hike in Jobless Benefit Advances</HD>
<DH>Legislature: State Senate Democrats turn back GOP concerns
and approve $540-million outlay for those who lost jobs after Sept.
11. Bill goes to Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Senate Democrats overcame Republican opposition Monday and approved
Gov. Gray Davis' bill to give $540 million in higher unemployment
benefits to Californians who lost their jobs since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans unsuccessfully sought assurances that $940 million in
new federal jobless aid for California would be dedicated to
unemployment benefits and not be spent for any other purpose.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't trust Gov. Davis," said GOP floor leader Jim Brulte of
Rancho Cucamonga.</LD>
<TE>   Majority Democrats countered that the federal funds to extend
benefits an extra 13 weeks, approved by Congress and President Bush,
would be spent for unemployment benefits. They refused to accept the
Republican proposal.</TE>
<TE>   On a straight party line vote of 24 to 5, the bill, SB 2, was sent
to an expected friendly reception in the Democrat-dominated Assembly.
Nine Republicans and two Democrats did not vote.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Davis and the Legislature approved the biggest increase
in jobless benefits in nearly 10 years, a long-sought victory for
organized labor. Effective Jan. 1, the first of four incremental
increases boosted the maximum weekly payment to $330, a sum that will
rise to $450 by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   However, most workers who lost their jobs in 2001 were ineligible
for the higher benefits, including those affected by the events of
Sept. 11--about 15,000 airline, hotel and other tourism industry
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the governor's bill envisioned making the improved
benefits retroactive to workers whose unemployment was a consequence
of Sept. 11. However, it was expanded to include others who were
unemployed on Sept. 11 but for different reasons.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), author of the bill and
chairman of the Senate Labor Committee who carried last year's
benefits increase bill, said the governor's legislation was expanded
to include non-Sept. 11 workers as a "matter of equity" for all
unemployed Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, major employer business organizations, including the
California Chamber of Commerce, California Taxpayers Assn., newspaper
publishers and manufacturers, have warned that the increased benefits
will cost far more than had been anticipated and threaten to bankrupt
the unemployment insurance trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   In Senate debate Monday, Republicans insisted that even without
the retroactive benefits bill, employers face a $530-million tax
increase in 2003 to pay for the higher benefits resulting from last
year's law alone.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte told the Senate that Republicans would vote for the Alarcon
bill if it was amended to specify that $940 million in new federal
unemployment benefits would be spent strictly for unemployment
payments in California.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that the Democratic governor might divert the federal
money to help him balance the state budget and erase a projected
$14.5-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis can take that $940 million that is designed to go for
unemployment benefits and put it in the state general fund. And
businesses will have to pick up an additional $540 million under this
bill," Brulte told the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans did get one victory. On the first roll call, they
refused to give Democrats the votes needed to pass the bill by a
two-thirds majority. Such a majority is required if the benefits are
to take effect immediately upon the governor's signature.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon had to amend it to make it a simple majority vote bill.
This means that instead of taking effect immediately, the benefits
would be delayed until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns its
special session on economic issues. No one knows when this will be.</TE>

<HD>7 Accused of Aiding Terrorism Seek Dismissal of Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers asked a Los Angeles federal judge Monday to dismiss
criminal charges against seven Iranian emigres accused of raising
money for an organization on the State Department's roster of
terrorist groups.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi promised to rule within a
week.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iraqi-based group
that opposes the Iranian regime, was properly designated as a
terrorist organization by the State Department.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of
Columbia found that the State Department had violated the group's
due-process rights by not giving it a chance to rebut the terrorism
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court refused to set aside the designation but
directed the State Department to give the group a hearing. After
doing so, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell reaffirmed the
designation.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, who are free on bail, were accused of raising
$5,000 to $10,000 a day at Los Angeles International Airport by
asking foreign travelers for donations to feed starving children in
Iran. According to the FBI, the money was used to buy arms, including
mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. The defendants have denied the
allegations.</TE>

<HD>Conflict Is Alleged in Vote by El Monte Councilman</HD>
<DH>Politics: Critics question Jack Thurston's impartiality on
car dealership expansion. He denies he was influenced by his
employer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day last summer, El Monte Councilman Jack Thurston got a state
license to sell vehicles at a local Hyundai dealership.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, Thurston voted to approve an agreement between the
city and his new boss. The dealership's owners hope to expand, and
the agreement could provide them with some prime real estate occupied
by homes and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Now some residents are questioning whether Thurston was
representing voters or his boss--even though he didn't start working
for the dealership until a few days after the vote.</LD>
<TE>   "The neighbors saw him working for the car dealer," said Norma
Edith Garcia, a neighborhood activist. "He is getting paid by the car
dealer at the same time he is trying to give him a sweetheart deal at
the neighborhood's expense."</TE>
<TE>   State officials said Thurston sought and received a license to
work as a car salesman from the Department of Motor Vehicles for the
parent company of Famous Ed's Hyundai on July 16.</TE>
<TE>   On July 17, the City Council, sitting as the redevelopment agency
board, approved a contract to give Scott Gunderson exclusive rights
to negotiate with the city to obtain a four- to six-acre site north
of the San Bernardino Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Gunderson was seeking the city's help to expand Famous Ed's, which
he owns with partner Ed Dominguez. He also wanted to relocate his
Scott Pontiac GMC dealership, on Valley Boulevard, next to Famous
Ed's on Santa Anita Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez concurs with DMV records showing Thurston obtained his
license to sell cars for Famous Ed's on July 16. Thurston actually
began work, he said, on July 21, four days after the council approved
the agreement with Gunderson.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston, who worked about a month, was paid on a commission basis
and received at least two biweekly checks, Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston said he did work as a car salesman at the dealership, but
said it did not create a conflict of interest. But he gives
conflicting accounts of when he worked for the dealership.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Oct. 10, Thurston said, as did Dominguez, that he
worked for Famous Ed's until August.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not worked with Gunderson in more than a month and a
half," he said. "[My] former employer has nothing to do with it [the
vote]."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Thurston gave a different timeline for his
employment. "I did not vote on anything until long after leaving," he
insisted, saying he did not work there in July. When asked if worked
there in April or May, he replied yes.</TE>
<TE>   DMV officials said Thurston was not licensed to sell cars at that
time. But they also said it is not uncommon for salespeople to work
in other jobs at a dealership before obtaining a sales license.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston, an 11-year council veteran, said he left the car
dealership on good terms. "He was a good boss," Thurston said of
Gunderson. "He paid me every two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   But his relationship with Gunderson, he said, would not influence
his vote on any city business with the dealer in the future.</TE>
<TE>   One of Thurston's council colleagues, Tony Fellow, said Thurston's
ethics were above reproach. "Jack Thurston is the most honorable man
of integrity I have ever served with on a board," Fellow said. "We
need people like him in local government and Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow said some of Thurston's critics have pushed the issue out
of political ambition. "Norma Garcia, she wants to run for council,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston, 66, got into the car business after, among other things,
running a drapery business and working as a dispatcher and
administrator at a bus company. He said he decided to get out of the
car-selling business "because I found better things to do, like
retirement."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts familiar with conflict-of-interest issues say
conduct such as Thurston's may violate state laws.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's Government Code 1090, public officials "shall
not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their
official capacity." City officers with financial interests in a
contract cannot vote or participate in a contract decision.</TE>
<TE>   Those convicted of violating the law can be thrown out of office.
Municipal lawyers say agreements for exclusive negotiations--such as
the one the El Monte City Council approved--are considered contracts
that fall within the provisions of that law.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Wilson said under
the law, a "financial interest" isn't narrowly defined as a payment
to a public official. He offered an example: An official votes on an
issue affecting a company while knowing--and that knowledge is a key
factor--the company will hire him in the future. That would
constitute a conflict even if the official wasn't technically an
employee when the vote occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Public officials are also subject to the Political Reform Act,
which prohibits them from having an economic interest in any issue
they vote on or discuss.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stern, president of the Center for Government Studies, who
helped write the reform act, said a public official who receives $500
or more from any individual in wages or commissions before a decision
cannot vote on a contract involving that person.</TE>
<TE>   An official with a contract for work, a written offer of a job or
some legal guarantee that he or she is being given a job also cannot
vote, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the law does not apply, however, if a public official gets
a job with a person after voting on a contract involving that
individual. "Conflicts aren't black and white," Stern added.</TE>
<TE>   Thurston said he consulted with City Atty. E. Clarke Moseley and
was told by the lawyer it was appropriate to vote. Moseley did not
return telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Thurston did not raise the possibility of a conflict of
interest, Moseley did--for himself.</TE>
<TE>   His El Monte law firm also represents car dealer Gunderson. He
asked the city to bring in another attorney to handle issues related
to the negotiations, according to meeting minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Gunderson and Dominguez said they also consulted with a lawyer
before hiring Thurston. Dominguez said his only motivation for hiring
Thurston was to help a friend. Dominguez said there was no conflict
of interest because Thurston was working on commission.</TE>
<TE>   State law does not distinguish between commission and salary, said
Roman Porter, spokesman for the California Fair Political Practices
Commission, a state watchdog agency.</TE>
<TE>   Gunderson, meanwhile, plans to continue working with the city to
expand his dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have their own motivations for expanding the
dealership, and it comes down to economics. El Monte is home to 65
car dealerships, and their tax dollars are the lifeblood of the
blue-collar city of 116,000 residents. Those tax dollars pay for
police, firefighters and pothole repairs, city officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The site, bordered on the west by Santa Anita Avenue and on the
east by Granada Avenue, is part of a redevelopment area, where the
city has the authority to take property by eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Harold Johanson said the area was designated for
redevelopment after a year of discussions between staff members and a
neighborhood committee, so it should have come as no shock to
residents when the expansion plan for Famous Ed's was proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Johanson said the city staff, in response to residents' protests,
has dropped plans to acquire and bulldoze a dozen houses on the west
side of Granada, but it still intends to acquire a few aging
apartment buildings north of Santa Anita and a house on Brockway.</TE>
<TE>   The city could use the power of eminent domain to take the
properties, but officials say owners usually sell. "There has never
been a case in the city where people were displaced and didn't come
out ahead of the game," Thurston said.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents say Thurston is not one to judge.</TE>
<TE>   "This [is a] person who is going to decide the future of this
community and who at the same time is involved with the car
dealership," said Hernan Munayco, a neighborhood leader. "I don't
think he can make an impartial decision. It's immoral and it upsets
us that Gunderson has direct contact with a council member."</TE>

<LD>Former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has been hired by a
California water developer to head a new company tackling water
projects in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Brackpool, chief executive of Cadiz Inc. in Santa Monica,
announced Monday that Babbitt will lead an unnamed subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   Babbitt, a former Arizona governor, was secretary of the
Department of Interior under President Clinton. Federal agencies
under his jurisdiction reviewed a Cadiz project to store and pump
groundwater from a Mojave Desert aquifer along the Metropolitan Water
District's Colorado River aqueduct.</LD>
<TE>   The MWD is expected to vote later this year whether to partner
with Cadiz on the project, which has been slowed by
environmentalists' demands for greater scrutiny.</TE>

<HD>Parcel for 2 Schools to Be Bought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District closed a $25.7-million deal
Monday to buy a 40-acre parcel in South Gate for a new high school
and middle school to ease severe classroom overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   The 3,654-student high school and 1,873-student middle school are
expected to open by 2005 on the site of a former industrial park.
Both campuses will have year-round schedules.</LD>
<LD>   "This is huge news for South Gate," said Jim McConnell, the
district's chief facilities executive. "Anything we can do to help
there is a major accomplishment."</LD>
<TE>   As it stands, South Gate Middle School is the most crowded in the
nation. Designed for about 2,500 students, it has 5,000. Students
must wait an average of 45 minutes to buy lunch, McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate High School, built in 1932 for about 1,700 students, is
attended by 4,634.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, the Los Angeles Board of Education abandoned, for
the time being, a separate school construction project in South Gate
after the discovery of highly contaminated soil on a 40-acre site
bought for $65 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of a soil cleanup plan was estimated at about $20
million.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to clean that land up and keep it," McConnell said.
"This community is so overcrowded I'm sure we'll need it for future

<HD>STD Plan Is Rejected by U.S.</HD>
<DH>Health: State had proposed that chlamydia patients'
partners not covered by Medi-Cal be treated to counter increase in
cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government has rejected a California proposal to provide
antibiotics to treat the sexual partners of Medi-Cal beneficiaries
infected with chlamydia.</LD>
<LD>   The move by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
could impede the state's effort to reverse recent increases in the
sexually transmitted disease. State health officials especially want
to reduce the rate of reinfection among women, who face worse health
consequences than men from chlamydia.</LD>
<LD>   Because Medi-Cal is jointly funded by the state and federal
governments, the state proposal to treat sexual partners not enrolled
in the program was subject to approval by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services. In rejecting the request, a federal health
official cited rules governing the health program for low-income
people.</LD>
<TE>   "We understand the public health value of doing something like
this," said Linda Minamoto, associate regional Medicaid
administrator. "But our bottom line was that we could not define the
treatment of the partner as a service to the eligible [person], which
is what we would have to do in order to pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   Minamoto said officials also were concerned about a state law that
allows antibiotics for chlamydia to be dispensed without a doctor's
exam. "I don't know that we, as an agency, wanted to encourage
something like that. Typically, we wouldn't consider that to be good
medicine."</TE>
<TE>   The state's request was the first of its kind in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we're disappointed," said Ken August, a spokesman for
the state Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching out to the sexual partners of Medi-Cal enrollees makes
medical and financial sense, public health officials said. If doctors
treat only an infected woman--and not her sexual partners--she has a
15% to 30% chance of becoming reinfected with the disease within six
months, research shows. And women who become repeatedly infected with
chlamydia face possible infertility, scarring and ectopic
pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment is relatively easy, usually consisting of a single dose
of Azithromycin, a common antibiotic.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said they don't have legislative approval to pay
for partner treatments with state-only funds. As a result, people
with limited income will be forced to seek care at free clinics or
through other subsidized programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly puts a roadblock into payment, but not for
treatment," said Gail Margolis, deputy director of medical care
services at the state Department of Health Services. "There are other
possible avenues."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the state Legislature approved the measure that allows
doctors to prescribe medication to the partners of chlamydia
patients, even if the physicians have never met the partners and do
not know their identities. Normally, doctors must conduct a
good-faith examination of patients before prescribing medications.</TE>
<TE>   Public health experts had found that the partners of people
infected with chlamydia often would not seek care on their own but
would take drugs if they didn't have to visit the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary data for 2001 suggest that reported infections topped
100,000 for the first time, up by nearly two-thirds in five years.</TE>

<HD>Dutchman in Product Dispute Takes Hostages, Kills Himself</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM
</DL>
<LD>A gunman upset with the quality of wide-screen television grabbed
as many as 18 hostages Monday in the tallest building in the Dutch
capital, then shot and killed himself after a seven-hour siege,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The hostages were freed unharmed, along with the more than 200 people
who were trapped in their offices. The gunman's identity was not
released.</LD>
<LD>   "At first I thought it was a joke," said Mark Herveys, an employee of
one of the 56 companies in the 35-story Rembrandt Tower. He said the
gunman grabbed him as he came through the door, stuck a gun in his chest
and told him to stand with other hostages.</LD>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Leo de Wit described the gunman as "mentally confused" and
said he shot himself twice in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with two guns and explosives, the man seized control of the
building in a protest against the Philips Electronics company, which he
complained failed to live up to its advertised promises.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman entered the building, where Philips was headquartered until
last year, shortly after most of its businesses opened for the day. He
took people in the crowded lobby hostage and never left the lobby level.</TE>
<TE>   Herveys said he and a few others slipped out a back door when the
gunman was distracted, after they had been held for about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   De Wit said a professional negotiator spoke with the gunman, who was
demanding media exposure for his complaints. After several hours, the man
told police he wanted to think about presenting more demands. He then
went into a restroom and shot himself.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement faxed from the office tower to state-financed NOS
television, the gunman complained that consumers were being misled about
the quality of the product.</TE>
<TE>   The statement reproduced parts of six letters of complaint previously
sent to a Dutch newspaper and the Consumer Board.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald van Kouwen, spokesman for the Consumer Board, said the public
body had several contacts with the man, whom he refused to name.</TE>
<TE>   "We dealt with him like hundreds of thousands of other callers. We
weren't threatened, and there was no reason for us to contact the
police," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MARSEILLE, France
</DL>
<LD>French truck drivers blocked refineries and oil depots Monday,
snarling traffic and triggering a run on gasoline in some areas, unions
said.</LD>
<LD>   Drivers, protesting over working hours, blocked at least 12 refineries
and oil depots mostly in the south.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not move until the government and employers sit down to
negotiate," Andre Ambrosino, a Marseille-based official at the CGT union,
said.</LD>
<TE>   Unions said they had targeted France's key petrochemical and refining
hub near Marseille and Avignon in the south, but action had spread across
the country to refineries in Dunkirk and other towns in the north.</TE>
<TE>   TotalFinaElf, the largest refiner in France, said the protests had not
affected its stocks or supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers in Rouen, Caen and Tours in the northwest caused traffic
jams, and others paralyzed a toll station, which led to motorists driving
by free.</TE>
<TE>   The drivers say they are not being paid for all the hours they work
because the government's 35-hour workweek does not factor in their
compulsory rest breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers blocked two refineries near the western town of Bordeaux,
shutting off gasoline supplies to main shopping centers and gas stations
in the southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Others blocked at least 10 transport depots near Marseille, preventing
trucks that supply large retail chains from leaving or entering, unions
said.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 300 people are now mounting barricades, and there are more
every hour," one union source said. Another said the action would get
worse during the day and that truckers would target other key refineries.</TE>

<DH>Agriculture: Congolese tycoon is thought to be the first black to
own a cellar. He aims to create a variety that will take the nation's
product to a new level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRANSCHHOEK, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>A Congolese wine lover who has penetrated this country's exclusive
wine industry wants to cultivate African palates while marketing what he
hopes will be an outstanding product.</LD>
<LD>   Telecommunications tycoon Miko Rwayitare bought the small Mont
Rochelle vineyard in the premier Western Cape viniculture region of
Franschhoek last year. His main objective is to create a variety that
will revolutionize the quality of South African wine and the way it is
perceived both at home and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   But Rwayitare is also having a pioneering impact on the industry.</LD>
<TE>   Although no statistics are available for the number of nonwhites with
leading positions in this country's wine business, industry watchers here
believe that Rwayitare is the first black to fully own a winery in South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   His entry into this elite club comes at a time when the country is
navigating a complex path toward integrating the hierarchy of a
profession that was once reserved exclusively for whites.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody told me I was crazy," said Rwayitare, 59, recalling how
friends and colleagues reacted when he announced that he was going to
spend about 16 million rand--the equivalent today of about $1.4
million--to purchase Mont Rochelle, despite the fact that he knew nothing
about the wine business.</TE>
<TE>   "But they said the same thing when I started the mobile phone business
in Africa," he said. "I don't see why I can't succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1985, Rwayitare's cellular phone company, Telecel, is
doing a thriving trade in 14 African nations, and that's where he
eventually hopes to make a significant dent with an exclusive, so-called
icon wine that would sell for about $20 a bottle. He hopes to have it in
circulation by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Already, South Africa is the seventh-largest wine-producing
country--ahead of Chile, Australia and New Zealand. However, skeptics
believe that Rwayitare's presence as a person of color among the upper
echelon of the wine business will remain a rarity for a long time,
because progress toward black empowerment in the field is still
incremental.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an imbalance in the industry today in terms of black and
white," said Jabulani Ntshangase, a veteran wine company manager who is
black. "It is man-made, orchestrated to keep blacks out, so that even
eight years after our democracy, there are still some walls. There is an
invisible electric fence."</TE>
<TE>   Ntshangase goes to high schools and talks to students from
disadvantaged backgrounds about possible careers in viniculture and
oenology that would allow them to become winemakers and vineyard owners,
as opposed to just field laborers.</TE>
<TE>   At Western Cape province's Stellenbosch University, there are 24
undergraduates pursuing degrees in agriculture with majors in viniculture
and oenology, Ntshangase said. Their education is primarily funded by the
South African Wine Industry Trust as part of an affirmative action
program to get more blacks into the business.</TE>
<TE>   But even this program has built-in obstacles. Since the first black
wine industry students enrolled at Stellenbosch in 1997, only one has
graduated.</TE>
<TE>   Mzokhona Mvemve, 26, took six years, instead of the normal four,
because of language difficulties. Stellenbosch has historically taught
courses in Afrikaans, typically a third language for blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mvemve was able to submit work in English, his second
language--in which he is proficient--most of the literature, lectures and
textbooks for the course were in Afrikaans.</TE>
<TE>   "You can imagine being in a class and being lectured in a medium you
don't really understand. That was a struggle," Mvemve said. "I started to
learn just to pass, rather than to really get to know the subject."</TE>
<TE>   Black Stellenbosch students also find themselves at a disadvantage in
the traditionally conservative winery world when they try to gain
on-the-job experience.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mvemve has no hesitation about entering a profession that has
typically been viewed as elitist. On the contrary, he is eager to become
a role model in his chosen field.</TE>
<TE>   "My being there is going to change the whole picture of the industry,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of black empowerment in the wine industry are hopeful that
changing the racial mix in the top ranks will also help transform the
perception of wine and its limited consumption among average blacks.
That, in turn, could help boost domestic sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Wine is not really part of the African culture and lifestyle," said
Vaughan Johnson, who owns a prestigious wine shop at Cape Town's trendy
Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront. "African people are largely beer drinkers."</TE>
<TE>   Ntshangase insists that acquiring a taste for wine is just a matter of
becoming properly acquainted with the product.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me one person who is born with a wine gene in their system, or a
beer gene," he said. "It's all exposure and education."</TE>
<TE>   Rwayitare, the owner of Mont Rochelle, would no doubt subscribe to
that theory.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that he has no formal qualifications in wine
production, he is adamant that relying on his business acumen, and taste
buds, will help him to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "What I know is good wine from around the world, and I appreciate
wine," said Rwayitare, who believes that South Africa sells its wine for
far less than it's worth. The most expensive wine at his winery costs
less than $5.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to make a profit in the wine business is to produce
exclusive wine," said Johnson, the merchant. "The best way to make a
large fortune in the wine industry is to start with a high profit."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Rwayitare plans to do. To achieve his goal of
manufacturing an A-grade wine, 80% of which he hopes to export, he has
embarked on a multimillion-dollar project to restructure his 82-acre
estate, including revamping the cellar to make it more globally
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   He is also negotiating contracts with some of the country's leading
growers who already cultivate superior grapes--the key to producing a
superior wine, according to Justin Hoy, cellar master at Mont Rochelle.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnicity aside, Rwayitare's success will ultimately depend on the
grade of his vineyard's soil, the cooperation of the weather and the
quality of his vines, Hoy said. And Rwayitare's confidence, enthusiasm
and willingness to take risks may in the end be remembered far more than
his race.</TE>
<TE>   "In every industry you should have a maverick, and [in the wine
industry] Miko could be that maverick," Hoy said.</TE>

<DL>AHMADABAD, India
</DL>
<LD>Groups of Hindus attacked Muslims on Monday as religious violence
that has killed hundreds in western India continued to smolder.</LD>
<LD>   Roaming mobs returned to Panvad, where 30 shops and homes were burned
Sunday by about 2,000 Hindu tribesmen who surrounded the village, Deputy
Police Supt. B.L. Parmar said.</LD>
<LD>   Panvad is 60 miles southeast of Ahmadabad in Gujarat state.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, a large crowd descended on the village. Police said they
fired 119 rounds and 140 tear gas shells to disperse the rioters but were
overrun in many places. At least 21 policemen were injured, said B.S.
Vasava, also a deputy superintendent of police.</TE>
<TE>   Rioting in Gujarat began Feb. 27 when Muslims burned a train full of
Hindu activists who had been visiting Ayodhya, where they want to build a
temple on the site of a 16th century mosque that they tore down in 1992.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Responding to U.S. criticism of its human rights record, China
returned fire in a blistering rebuttal Monday--a point-by-point
dismantling of American society that depicts a nation beset by crime,
violent media images, indifference to poverty and arrogant foreign
policy.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the report, the latest in a series issued annually in recent
years by the State Council Information Office, is based on a single
cornerstone: that the U.S. government has no business criticizing other
nations' human rights records before it cleans its own house.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-page report was released on the English-language service of the
official New China News Agency.</LD>
<TE>   Among the report's many assertions:</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S. is "wantonly infringing upon human rights of other
countries" with military and political actions.</TE>
<TE>   * American mass media are "inundated with violent content," which
encourages more violence.</TE>
<TE>   * Racism and discrimination continue unabated.</TE>
<TE>   * Police brutality, torture and forced confessions "are common," and
death rows are full of "misjudged or wronged" inmates. Prisons are
overcrowded and inhumane.</TE>
<TE>   * Americans living in poverty are "the forgotten 'third world' within
this superpower," and the gap between rich and poor is growing.</TE>
<TE>   China says it has made great strides in improving its own human rights
record and insists that many of what the U.S. criticizes as rights
violations are simply efforts to maintain order.</TE>

<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>Eight hundred adopted Chinese children have been given permission
by Beijing to live with their families in Hong Kong after a bitter
struggle, the territory's Department of Immigration said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Since this former British colony was returned to China in 1997, many
mainland Chinese have demanded the right to live here, prompting protests
and legal battles.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Hong Kong's top court ruled that mainland children adopted
by families from the territory had no right to live here. Three months
later, the government struck a deal with Beijing allowing some parents to
apply for residency for the adoptees.</LD>
<TE>   Immigration authorities in Hong Kong said Monday that the Chinese
government has decided to approve applications for Hong Kong residency
for 800 children with no remaining relatives on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did not say how many applications had been made or how many
were rejected. But Hong Kong human rights activist Ho Hei-wah told radio
stations that he knows at least four families in the territory with
adopted children whose applications were denied.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Steps Out on World Stage With Pledge to Britain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney moved Monday to quiet British critics of
possible military action against Iraq, as he set out on his first
overseas trip as vice president, a 12-nation journey to round up support
for the next phase in the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney, in a luncheon with Prime Minister Tony Blair, heard no open
discussion of reluctance to expand the war to encompass Iraq. But growing
unease within Blair's Labor Party over taking on Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein has formed a backdrop to the vice president's visit here before
he moves on to the Middle East, where the anxiety is palpable.</LD>
<LD>   With Blair at his side at a news conference at 10 Downing St., the
prime minister's office and residence, Cheney said the United States and
Britain would act against Iraq "only in the closest possible
consultation-coordination."</LD>
<TE>   And Blair, who plans to visit President Bush in Texas next month, with
Iraq high on the agenda, took pains to emphasize that no decisions had
been made. However, he said, "this is a time when we discuss how
important it is that the issue of weapons of mass destruction is properly
dealt with."</TE>
<TE>Visit Seen as 1st Session to Plot Anti-Iraq Moves</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's visit was being regarded here as the opening
strategy meeting for what Washington is increasingly presenting as an
inevitable campaign to eliminate the threat posed by whatever chemical
weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction, Hussein has at his
disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Blair is leaving all options open without publicly committing now to
military aid.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the prime minister took a
leading role in making the public case for attacking the Al Qaeda
terrorist network. Similarly, he laid out Monday the argument against
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat of weapons of mass destruction will have to be addressed,"
Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be under no doubt whatever," he said forcefully. "Saddam
Hussein has acquired weapons of mass destruction over a long period of
time. . . . He's in breach of at least nine U.N. Security Council
resolutions about weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   But the prime minister faces growing opposition from the British
public and members of his Labor Party to a military campaign to topple
Hussein. Seventy Labor members of Parliament have signed a letter
expressing "deep unease" at the prospect of British involvement in a
military operation. One Cabinet minister, International Development
Secretary Clare Short, expressed outright opposition.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Blair's political allies said that any military action
against Iraq should be under U.N. sponsorship and only after an Iraqi
weapons buildup has been proved.</TE>
<TE>   They said their discomfort grew with news last weekend that the
Pentagon was seeking the development of nuclear weapons suited for use
against Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   "This will encourage nuclear proliferation and perhaps take us all one
step closer to war," they wrote, urging instead that Iraq be pressured to
readmit U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Previewing an argument he is likely to make when he reaches the Middle
East, Cheney said the Pentagon has not aimed weapons at those countries
even though nuclear policies have been shifted to reflect new threats.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has looked askance at relying heavily on
weapons inspectors to reduce Iraq's arsenal, despite the seeming
political appeal inspections have in Europe as a means to avoid conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether Hussein is abiding by the U.N. Security
Council resolution under which he is required to get rid of all weapons
of mass destruction, Cheney said. Hussein is known to have used chemical
weapons against Iraqi opponents, to have developed biological weapons and
to have tried to gain access to nuclear weapons technology, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations and Iraq are scheduled to discuss next month the
conditions for readmitting inspectors. Cheney said inspectors must
operate without limits, under a "go anywhere any time kind of regime" to
determine that Hussein is not hiding anything.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president was scheduled to leave Britain this morning. His
11-day tour will take him to nearly every Middle Eastern state except
Syria, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq. The tour was arranged as an opportunity to
begin the diplomatic groundwork for carrying the anti-terror war beyond
Afghanistan. But the spiraling Israeli-Palestinian violence is
complicating his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Middle East experts fully expect leaders in the region to tell Cheney
in private meetings that they cannot be expected to sign on to a campaign
against Iraq while no progress is being made to calm more than 17 months
of Israeli-Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president said the issues are not linked but that "we have an
obligation to deal with both simultaneously."</TE>
<TE>Polls Find British Now Less Supportive of U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, where opposition to an anti-Iraq campaign is much lower
than Cheney is likely to encounter later in the week, support for the
alliance with the United States has fallen off considerably since Sept.
11. A poll published by the Mail on Sunday, a tabloid newspaper, found
the public split over the use of British troops against Iraq, with just
45% in favor and 43% opposed. Another 12% of the 2,000 people polled
expressed no opinion.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment came on top of a poll in which only 28% of British
respondents said they trusted the U.S. to be the "world's policeman,"
while 38% said they did not trust the U.S. at all.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting such skepticism about Washington's course, columnist
Madeleine Bunting in the left-of-center Guardian asked, "Will Cheney
grasp the perception common outside the U.S. that never has a nation
squandered sympathy and moral advantage so quickly and with such
wantonness?"</TE>
<TE>   Six months after the Sept. 11 attacks, she said, "it is not so much
Islamist hijackers as U.S. bombs that make the world feel a precarious
place."</TE>
<TE>   Only the conservative Times of London supported the U.S. nuclear
review, saying, "This is less Dr. Strangelove than the territory that
comes with superpower status."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Saudis Block Assets of Charity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities, working in conjunction with Saudi Arabia, blocked
the assets of a Saudi charity's offices in Somalia and Bosnia on Monday,
saying they had been linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill announced the crackdown on the
six-month commemoration of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Just back from a week of meetings with leaders of four Middle Eastern
nations, O'Neill said U.S. officials have made significant progress in
establishing a coalition to cut off the Al Qaeda network's money pipeline
and its ability to launch terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neill said U.S. and Saudi officials moved Monday to block some
assets of the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, a Saudi-based charity he
said had ties to Bin Laden and other terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Few deceits are more reprehensible than the act of collecting charity
from well-intentioned donors and then diverting those funds to support
hatred and cruelty," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   The action marked the first time the U.S. and another nation have
worked together since Sept. 11 to freeze the financial assets of an
organization suspected of helping terrorists, according to O'Neill and
other Treasury officials.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill would not discuss the specifics of the effort but said
authorities had reliable information that money raised in Al Haramain's
offices in Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had been diverted to support
terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   The action affects only those two offices of Al Haramain, not its
headquarters in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and prevents the charity's
main office from sending funds to them.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the charity in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a
request for comment. O'Neill said there were no indications that
officials at the group's headquarters were either involved in funneling
money to terrorists or knew about employees who were.</TE>
<TE>   According to the group's Web site, Al Haramain helps feed and educate
the poor in dozens of countries, including war-torn nations or regions
such as Somalia, Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations have a significant presence
in Bosnia and Somalia, where the branch offices "are clearly linked to
terrorist financing," said a Treasury Department memo. It said the
Somalia office of Al Haramain is linked to Al Qaeda and Al Itihaad al
Islamiya, a Somali terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   Al Haramain's Bosnia office has been linked to Gamaa al Islamiya, an
Egyptian terrorist group, Treasury officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, O'Neill said, more than $104 million in financial
assets linked to Al Qaeda and Afghanistan's former ruling Taliban militia
have been blocked worldwide. The United States has identified 191
individuals and organizations suspected of financing or engaging in
terrorism and wants their assets frozen, O'Neill said.</TE>

<HD>'Critical Habitat' Status Withdrawn for Western Salmon and
Steelhead</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Builders hail the Bush administration decision, which
removes protections for 19 endangered and threatened species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced an agreement Monday to withdraw
"critical habitat" designations for 19 species of threatened and
endangered salmon and steelhead in California, Oregon, Washington and
Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   Builders said the administration's action would remove a significant
deterrent to construction in many areas of the four states. It signaled
that economic considerations would receive more weight than before as the
administration decides what habitats will be protected to help endangered
and threatened species recover.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement will not change the designation of the 19 species as
endangered. But the loss of "critical habitat" status could make it
easier for developers to get permission to go ahead with projects ranging
from single-family home additions to entire subdivisions.</LD>
<TE>   The accord was reached with the National Assn. of Home Builders, which
had sued the government's National Marine Fisheries Service over the
"critical habitat" designations.</TE>
<TE>   The home builders had argued that the designations were excessive and
unduly vague, and that they lacked required analyses of environmental
impact.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement will take hold only if approved by U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington. It stems from an order by the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals requiring federal agencies to analyze the
economic impact of decisions to protect "critical habitats" of endangered
species.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Fisheries Service said fish would not be harmed by the
action.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to use other tools to protect that habitat as best
we can," said Jim Lecky, the service's assistant northwest regional
administrator for protective resources. "It still is illegal to harm
endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   But Craig Wingert, a supervisory fisheries biologist for the service's
southwest division, said the agency would forfeit some ability to protect
the fish where small numbers of fish have been found.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some places where having critical habitat has given us
leverage that we would not have had just with the listing," Wingert said.
"We'll lose a little bit, but I don't think it's real significant."</TE>
<TE>California Areas Will Be Affected</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, however, decried the decision as an unjustified
voluntary removal by the federal government of important protections for
prized species.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous," said Mike Senatore, litigation director for
Defenders of Wildlife. "It reflects an administration that is not
concerned at all about protecting listed species."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows a real lack of support for salmon restoration in
salmon-dependent communities in the Northwest," said Nicole Cordan of
Portland, Ore.-based Save Our Wild Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The "critical habitat" designated in 2000 for the 19 populations of
chinook, chum and sockeye salmon and steelhead covered most of the
country's Pacific coast from northern Washington stretching into Los
Angeles County. It also covered inland streams and creeks in all four
states. California's Central Valley and about half of the coast were
included as critical habitat for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   In areas of critical habitat, many building permits require
environmental reviews, which can stall, change or cancel projects.</TE>
<TE>   "They named every blasted watershed as a place that the fish might be,
which meant that any activity on land that might deliver sediment to a
stream or otherwise impact the habitat of the fish is forbidden," said
Ernie Platt, a developer and vice president of the Oregon Building
Industry Assn., the state branch of the National Assn. of Home Builders.
"Good Lord, that covers everything.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had a piece of property in any proximity to a stream, you had
to go through such a horrendous process to ensure that what you
contemplated doing would not kill a fish. How do you do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision veered from the federal government's recent practice
of retaining habitat designations in settlements while making adjustments
to reflect court decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Todd True, an attorney for Earthjustice, disputed the legal grounds
for the government's decision to rescind a designation without going
through a lengthy rule-making process that would be open to public
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Developers and builders hope, and environmentalists fear, that
Monday's decision will set the stage for overturning critical habitat
designations for other species designated during the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>A Way to Settle Lawsuits by Builders</TE>
<TE>   The effect could be especially great in California, which has more
endangered species than any other state except Hawaii. Several of the
species' habitats are under review, including the red-legged frog, the
Riverside fairy shrimp, the Alameda whipsnake and the Southwestern arroyo
toad.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good news, because it shows the agency is willing to
reconsider critical habitat designations," said Phil Serna, a vice
president of the Home Builders Assn. of North California, which is suing
to block critical habitat designation for the red-legged frog.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration said it reached the agreement because a
federal judge recently ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had
failed to conduct adequate economic analysis in the designation of
critical habitat for another threatened species, the Southwestern willow
flycatcher.</TE>
<TE>   True said the action fit a pattern by the Bush administration of
compromising environmental protections to settle lawsuits filed by
business groups rather than fighting.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM EAST ST. LOUIS</KH>
<HD>A Struggling City Fights Perceptions</HD>
<DH>Safety: A lawmaker's comment that the town is too scary to visit
unarmed raises the ire of local leaders working to rebuild the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>This is a boarded-up and beaten-down city, a city of abandoned
buildings and lots heaped with rubble, of windows secured with iron
grates.</LD>
<LD>   But it is, as well, a city with ambition.</LD>
<LD>   So it stung when a lawmaker from across the Mississippi River, in
Missouri, recently slammed East St. Louis as too scary to visit unarmed.
Dismissing talk that the Cardinals baseball team might build a new
stadium here, Missouri state Rep. Jim Murphy told a TV interviewer that
fans would never come. "To go over to East St. Louis," he said, "you'll
have to get your rifle."</LD>
<TE>   The remark stirred a furor on both sides of the river.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the 31,500 residents of East St. Louis are black.
Murphy, a Republican from suburban St. Louis, is white. When his comment
hit the air late last month, local African American leaders held a news
conference to denounce it as racist. Murphy showed up unannounced to
defend himself--and got into a shouting match with a prominent black
clergyman.</TE>
<TE>Lawmaker Says News Influenced Comment</TE>
<TE>   When Murphy tried an apology of sorts a few days later, he only made
things worse. Insisting that he had no idea East St. Louis was 98% black,
the veteran lawmaker said he based his comments not on racist
stereotypes, but on news stories about out-of-control crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Every month or so, you see photos of dead bodies turning up over
there. Is that the most desirable place to locate a stadium that will
draw families?" he said. "There was nothing derogatory meant. My heart
goes out to the people of East St. Louis if it's really as bad as the
media make it seem."</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Harvey E. Henderson could do without such condolences.</TE>
<TE>   In office for a year and a half, Henderson has taken on the challenge
of bringing more tourists into his impoverished community. He's not
starting quite from scratch: The Casino Queen, a riverboat moored here,
already draws out-of-town gamblers by the thousands to play blackjack,
roulette and Caribbean stud poker. But most of those visitors never
venture past the Casino Queen parking lot, right off the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson's goal is to bring folks into East St. Louis itself: To the
museum honoring dance legend Katherine Dunham, to the boyhood home (once
it's renovated) of jazz great Miles Davis, to the athletic center founded
by track-and-field star Jackie Joyner-Kersee.</TE>
<TE>   Even more critical, he has to convince developers that they can earn
money here. The baseball stadium likely is out of reach; the Cardinals
are eager to build a new ballpark in downtown St. Louis if they can
secure more than $200 million in public financing. If that deal falls
through, however, East St. Louis stands ready to woo the team.</TE>
<TE>Despite Crime, Tourism Projects in the Pipeline</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Henderson is courting other attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson says one major project should get underway here this year: a
huge riverfront hall that will host touring cultural exhibits too big for
ordinary museums--such as recent shows on imperial Russia and ancient
Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas he has in mind include a marina, a swanky hotel and a
factory outlet mall. The trick is to make the case to developers that
people will come from all over the region to shop here, or to play golf
along the Mississippi--that they won't be scared away by an East St.
Louis address.</TE>
<TE>   Comments like Murphy's do not help.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jim Murphy ought to be ashamed of himself," Henderson fumed.
"You don't need a rifle to come here. It's a slap in the face."</TE>
<TE>   For all his boosterism, however, Henderson acknowledges that East St.
Louis faces serious problems--starting with a chronically understaffed
police force. Henderson has promised to add six more officers this year.
In the meantime, Police Chief Delbert Marion has said, the force can do
little other than respond to 911 calls.</TE>
<TE>   There are not enough officers to crack down on the city's notorious
strip areas--crumbling blocks where prostitutes and drug pushers strut
day and night, Marion said. There are not enough detectives to
investigate nonviolent crimes unless there's an obvious suspect. The
force cannot even spare an officer to guard Mayor Debra Powell, who has
said she fears for her life because a suspicious character is harassing
her.</TE>
<TE>Police Work Questioned in Spate of Killings</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department's reputation is shaky as well because there has
been little progress in a notorious string of homicides, possibly the
work of a serial killer. In the past two years, the corpses of nine women
have turned up in the city. Another four bodies have been discovered
nearby. Late last year, Illinois state police let it be known that they
had a suspect in several of the killings. They even knew where their man
was: Serving time in an Illinois prison for an unrelated felony. But a
few weeks ago, they acknowledged that they had lost track of the suspect.
He had been released from prison and had vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Such news hardly bolsters public confidence in East St. Louis. And
there are other woes here besides. The city is desperately poor: One in
every five families lives in public housing, and more than half the
children live in poverty. While city officials say they are making
progress knocking down abandoned buildings, most streets sag with decay.</TE>
<TE>Problems Here Common in Any City, Some Say</TE>
<TE>   Still, some longtime residents--and some tourists who come to gamble
at the Casino Queen--say the city's bad reputation is not justified.
Sure, there are some neighborhoods that they might not want to stroll
through at night, or alone during the day. But they could say the same
about any other big city.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got neighborhoods in St. Louis with multimillion-dollar homes
where people are being robbed and shot," said Steve Thompson, 28, of St.
Louis. "I look at it as part of life. I don't classify particular
neighborhoods as good or bad."</TE>
<TE>   At her desk in East St Louis' stately new public library--an airy
$4.5-million building completed last year--interim manager Madie Dowell
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime's not so bad here," she said. "It used to be worse, believe it
or not."</TE>
<TE>   Dowell thought for a moment about Murphy's remark, then dismissed it
with a scornful wave. "He's entitled to his opinion," she said, "but
honestly, people come here all the time."</TE>

<LD>The operator of a Georgia crematory where hundreds of bodies were
found discarded last month was charged in Tennessee with six felony
counts of abuse of a corpse.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Brent Marsh, operator of the Tri-State Crematory in Noble, Ga.,
was already in custody in Walker County, Ga., charged with 174 counts of
theft by deception.</LD>
<LD>   County records show at least 250 bodies sent to the crematory since
1998 were from Tennessee. Bradley County Sheriff Dan Gilley said Marsh
traveled 50 miles from Noble to Cleveland to pick up bodies for cremation
under contract from Bradley County funeral homes.</LD>

<LD>Advocates of a $275,000-per-farm limit on government subsidies have
lost the support of California's senators, who have decided the
Senate-passed cap was unfair to their cotton and rice farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein are asking the
Senate's lead negotiators on new farm legislation to back off the payment
limit.</LD>
<LD>   Under current law, farmers can receive some subsidies in unlimited
amounts, and they could continue to do so under a House-passed farm bill.
Boxer and Feinstein were in the majority when the Senate voted 66-31 last

<LD>Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan filed for election to the Senate seat
to which she was appointed after her husband died in a plane crash.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the first campaign for Carnahan, 68, who said she will run
on her Senate record, not the memory or legacy of her late husband, Gov.
Mel Carnahan.</LD>
<LD>   "Many people say they have a hard time not thinking about what
happened when they look at me--and they're very supportive of what I'm
doing, the fact that I'm carrying on," she said. "But right now, I've got
to put forth my record. That's what I've got to stand on and run on."</LD>
<TE>   Carnahan has served in the Senate since Jan. 3, 2001. Her husband died
three weeks before the general election and his name remained on the
ballot.</TE>

and choose a death sentence for the former black power radical once known
as H. Rap Brown, who was convicted of killing a sheriff's deputy.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Ron Dixon told jurors that evidence they have
already heard justifies a death sentence.</LD>

<HD>Conservationists, Bush Camp Appear Locked in Stalemate Over Energy
Plan</HD>
<DH>Oil: Both sides have enough votes to block. Any bill passed by
Congress--if there even is a bill--likely would have minimal effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For weeks, President Bush and Democratic leaders have framed the
energy legislation pending in Congress this week as a form of homeland
defense: a way to reduce America's reliance on oil from the turbulent
Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   But now, the Senate appears poised to reject the principal ideas of
each side for maximizing America's energy independence.</LD>
<LD>   In a form of mutually assured destruction, the central proposals for
increasing both domestic energy production and conservation look doomed.
Environmentalists appear to have the votes to prevent oil drilling in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the top priority of the Bush
administration and the energy industry. Meanwhile, the administration and
the auto industry are in position to block mandated increases in
automotive fuel economy, the top goal for the environmental movement and
most Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   The result, critics say, may be a bill that only tinkers around the
margins of America's energy problems--if a bill emerges from Congress at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the two elephants in the legislation," said William W.
Martin, a former deputy Energy secretary in the Reagan administration and
now chairman of a Washington consulting firm. "If any compromise results
in having neither of them, then we don't have much of a policy as far as
the impact on oil imports."</TE>
<TE>   The standoff suggests that renewed national security concerns about
foreign oil haven't altered the dynamic that has largely frozen energy
policy for more than a decade: Neither the environmental movement nor the
oil and auto industries appear strong enough to move their priorities
past the other.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when Congress last tried to craft a comprehensive energy
policy, passage of the measure in 1992 came only after the provisions to
increase auto fuel efficiency and drill in the Arctic were removed.</TE>
<TE>   The same could happen in the days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, senior administration officials acknowledge they are well
short of the 60 Senate votes they would need to break a filibuster
against Bush's effort to open a portion of the Arctic refuge to oil
drilling. Sens. John F. Kerry (D-Mass) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.),
both of whom are exploring a run for the 2004 Democratic presidential
nomination, have pledged to filibuster any provision to open ANWR to
drilling.</TE>
<TE>   The administration "is a long way from having the votes to [break] a
filibuster on ANWR," said former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), now an
energy lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>Tougher Fuel Economy Standards Resisted</TE>
<TE>   The prospects for increasing fuel economy requirements--known formally
as CAFE, or corporate average fuel economy standards--don't look much
brighter.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Kerry and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reached agreement on a
bipartisan proposal that would require cars, SUVs and light trucks
combined to meet a fuel economy average of 36 miles per gallon by 2015.
That would be a 50% increase from today, when the vehicles combined
average 24 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, the United Auto Workers and especially the auto
industry are all vigorously opposing that proposal. All argue that it
would lead to less powerful, less safe vehicles and threaten U.S. auto
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry continues to work on potential compromises. He's trying, for
instance, to win the votes of farm-state lawmakers by amending the bill
to exclude full-size pickup trucks used for work from tougher fuel
economy standards. And new radio ads featuring actor Robert Redford start
today in six states urging key senators to support the new standards. But
with the auto industry pummeling the CAFE increase in ads targeted at
swing senators--and Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Christopher S. Bond
(R-Mo.) pushing an alternative that would leave the setting of standards
to the Transportation Department--even supporters are pessimistic about
their prospects of pushing a mandated increase through the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "The auto industry has the upper hand," acknowledged Dan Becker,
director of the global warming and energy program at the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Although the oil industry and environmentalists each dispute the
other's numbers, most experts agree that the Arctic refuge and fuel
economy provisions would have a greater impact on limiting U.S. use of
foreign oil than other aspects of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the Kerry-McCain proposal could save as much as 1
million barrels a day in 2015, 2 million a day in 2020 and 2.8 million a
day in 2025. The oil industry projects that drilling in ANWR could
ultimately yield 6 billion to 16 billion barrels of oil.</TE>
<TE>   Together, these two measures could put a significant dent in America's
growing dependence on foreign oil. During the debate, senators have
flashed photos of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein--from whose country the
United States imports oil--to underscore the national security
implications of energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers also have noted that during the 1973 Arab oil
embargo, the U.S. imported 36% of its oil; it now imports 56%.</TE>
<TE>   Imports are likely to increase from about 10 million barrels a day now
to 15 million barrels in 2010, experts say. Between them, the Arctic
drilling and fuel economy standards would probably eliminate about half
of the projected increase, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>Tax Credits Proffered to Encourage Conservation</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill has other provisions that would reduce dependence on
foreign oil. The measure contains $16 billion in tax credits to encourage
conservation and domestic production; it would also seek to accelerate
development of alternative fuels by requiring both the federal government
and private utilities to purchase an increasing share of their
electricity from such supplies over the next 20 years. Few, though, are
projecting vast short-term impact from those proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "Any bill that avoids both [expanded] drilling in the United States
and enhanced car technology is a bill that will be extremely ineffective
in reducing the growth in our dependence on the Middle East" for oil,
said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at Rice University in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   If the ANWR proposal and new fuel economy standards are each
eliminated, the political question for both Republicans and Democrats may
be whether there are sufficient remaining inducements to reach agreement
on a final bill that could win Bush's signature.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, the White House has made clear it wants the Senate to pass
a bill, virtually no matter what it contains.</TE>
<TE>   Such passage would move the measure along to a conference with the
House, which last year passed an energy bill that authorized drilling in
ANWR but proposed only a negligible increase in the fuel economy
standards. Presumably, a conference committee would tilt whatever the
Senate produces at least somewhat in the House direction, which is closer
to what Bush wants.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely for that reason, Democrats face the more difficult
calculation as the Senate debate continues.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders as of now are committed to passing a bill, even if
the improved fuel economy standards are eliminated, aides say. But
environmentalists are nervous about proceeding to a conference where
Arctic drilling would be on the table--because it passed the House--and
tougher CAFE rules would not, because it did not clear either chamber.
Rather than face that prospect, environmentalists may pressure Senate
Democrats to shelve the bill outright if the fuel economy standards are
defeated.</TE>

<DL>NASHVILLE
</DL>
<LD>Former Gov. Lamar Alexander, the two-time presidential candidate
who campaigned in a flannel shirt, announced Monday he will run for the
Senate seat that fellow Republican Fred Thompson is giving up this year.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an unexpected course of action for me," Alexander said. "I've
been happy as a private citizen, represented by the country's two best
senators. I regret Fred's decision, but I respect it."</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, who was first elected in 1994 to succeed Democrat Al Gore,
announced last week that he is retiring. Since then, several possible
candidates in both parties have emerged.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome of the race could help tip power to the GOP. Democrats
hold a one-vote majority in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, 61, who was Education secretary under the elder President
Bush and Tennessee's governor from 1979 to 1987, twice sought the GOP
nomination for president. He dropped out of the 2000 race after finishing
sixth in the Iowa straw poll, conceding he could not defeat then-Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.</TE>

<HD>Towers of Darkness Become Towers of Light as 9/11 Heroes Are
Honored</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Six months later, a fatherless daughter lights beams
that symbolize the fallen twin towers in one of several ceremonies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Moments of silence, pledges that good will overcome evil and twin
beams of light piercing the night sky on Monday commemorated the six
months since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We saw the worst of mankind. We saw the face of evil," New York Gov.
George Pataki told an audience, some fighting back tears, who gathered in
Battery Park to mark the moment that the first of two jetliners slammed
into the twin towers. Pataki pledged that 8:46 a.m. on Sept. 11 will
remain "a date and a time we will never forget."</LD>
<LD>   The true remembrance, added New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, "will
be in our hearts."</LD>
<TE>   At ground zero, workers paused briefly to recall the assault on
America before resuming the task of removing rubble and searching for
bodies. More than 2,800 people died at the site where the buildings
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>Mourners Gather at Other Crash Sites</TE>
<TE>   Similar ceremonies were held Monday in Washington, near where another
suicide pilot crashed into the Pentagon, and in western Pennsylvania,
where passengers struggling with the hijackers forced a fourth jetliner
into a field.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Methodist Church in Shanksville, Pa., hundreds of people
took part in a multi-faith service in which candles were lit and the
names of the 44 people who perished aboard the plane were read aloud.
Church bells tolled to remember the victims of United Airlines Flight 93.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing they hijacked was our name and our religion," said
Iman Fouad Bayly, representing the Islamic Center of Johnstown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Later, about 300 people journeyed to the crash site two miles away.
Flowers were placed next to a bronze marker in memory of the dead.</TE>
<TE>   A similar event took place at St. Paul's Chapel on Broadway in Lower
Manhattan, where all of the victims from the trade center, the Pentagon
and the Pennsylvania crash were memorialized.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the worst violation of America in our history," former Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani said Monday. He said everyone killed in the
attacks--firefighters, police officers, rescue workers "and many, many
hidden heroes . . . would want us to lift up our heads very, very high."</TE>
<TE>   At New York Police Department precincts throughout the city, officers
stood at attention and saluted while commanders read aloud the names of
23 of their comrades who were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center dead also included 343 firefighters and 37
police officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The New York commemoration came in two parts:</TE>
<TE>   First, on a cloudless morning similar to Sept. 11, officials dedicated
a massive sculpture that had been damaged in the attack as a temporary
monument. "The Sphere"--a steel and bronze sculpture created in 1971 by
artist Fritz Koenig to promote peace through international commerce--was
partially crushed by falling debris from the towers.</TE>
<TE>'Tribute in Light' Illuminates Manhattan</TE>
<TE>   Later, when darkness fell, officials gathered again to turn on two
huge beams of light that soared into the sky to symbolize the twin
towers.</TE>
<TE>   Jessye Norman of the Metropolitan Opera marked the moment by singing
"America the Beautiful," her voice ringing out into the cold, clear night
air. Someone in the crowd held up an American flag.</TE>
<TE>   "The lights are going up really high," said Arthur Leahy, whose
brother James, an NYPD officer for almost 10 years, perished at the trade
center. "Hopefully, he'll be looking down from heaven. It's a beautiful
thing, the lights reaching the sky."</TE>
<TE>   The "Tribute in Light" was switched on by 12-year-old Valerie Webb,
whose father, Port Authority Officer Nathaniel Webb, was killed in the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The light display will continue through April 13. Depending on weather
conditions, the columns are expected to be visible for at least 20 miles
around the trade center complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Look into your heart to remember those that are no longer with us,"
Bloomberg urged the crowd at the morning tribute.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they would have wanted us to make a better world. They would
have wanted us to show the terrorists that they cannot defeat us."</TE>

<HD>High in the Sky, Those in Sears Tower Keep Eyes Open Amid Strict
Security</HD>
<DH>Safety: Extra measures boost the confidence of many in the tallest
U.S. building. But some admit to fear of working in a potential target.</DH>

<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>People rushing to work in the nation's tallest building--the
110-story Sears Tower--were more concerned about the cutting winter wind
Monday than any security jitters exactly six months after the World Trade
Center attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "People are over it," said Rick Carrier, 43, a sales and marketing
executive with Universal Access, a telecommunications firm on the sixth
floor. "I think we've all moved on."</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say the specter of two hijacked planes slamming into the
twin towers in New York on Sept. 11 was far from the minds of the 10,000
Midwesterners, who scurried in the 20-degree cold to their offices in the
black-aluminum architectural landmark. A spate of weekend newspaper
articles, television shows and their own vivid memories made sure of
that.</LD>
<TE>   But Carrier and others say their confidence is based firmly on a
refrain shared by millions of Americans these days: In security measures
we trust.</TE>
<TE>   The Sears building has plenty. There are metal detectors, X-ray
machines, extra security guards, undercover police officers,
bomb-sniffing dogs, building identification cards, no-stopping zones at
the curb and sidewalks blocked by concrete barriers painted red, white
and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Next up: Security turnstiles at the eight access points to the
building's 104 elevators.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Spencer, spokesman for building manager TrizecHahn Office
Properties, said sending e-mail messages to the 124 client firms has
calmed employees and squelched rumors, especially when anthrax scares
brought the Fire Department to the South Wacker Drive address for
repeated false alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer wouldn't say how much the security measures cost but added
they will require a 1% increase in rent, among the city's priciest at up
to $45 a square foot. To people like attorney Jim Zahn, 59, the cost and
inconvenience have been worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Cahajla, a 44-year-old legal secretary, said she was comforted
when building management immediately tightened security after the
attacks. "They really implemented quite a bit of stuff," she said. "I
feel very, very safe here."</TE>
<TE>   Jullian Van Prooyen, 23, an underwriter for Chubb Insurance on the
46th floor, owned up to a bit of trepidation. "I get a little paranoid,
but I think it's very safe," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has been so sanguine about a building that many consider
a potential terrorist target.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Wilson, 39, an accountant, made no secret Monday about his
feelings as he pushed through the tower's revolving doors and into the
modernistic tan marble lobby with the large Alexander Calder sculpture.
It wasn't until last month that he could muster up the courage to walk
into the Sears Tower to go to his bank, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my favorite place, since six months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being closed six weeks to install new security screening
devices, the popular Sears Sky Deck continues to draw crowds of tourists
for the panoramic view of Chicago's skyscrapers, Lake Michigan and
streets stretching into the prairie. The deck reopened Oct. 29, and
former President Bush and Mayor Richard M. Daley were among the first to
visit as a show of confidence in the building's safety. Attendance has
been down only 4% for the popular attraction, which draws 1.5 million
people a year, Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Lynch, 40, of suburban Glen Ellyn, brought his 22-year-old
stepdaughter and her friend, both North Carolina college students, to the
Sears Tower just hours after she got off the plane. It was her first time
in Chicago and looking out from the sky deck was tops on her agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I had talked to them about the fact that it seems these terrorists
might get it in their head to make a strike on an anniversary, to strike
some kind of fear into us," said Lynch. But his stepdaughter and her
friend were unfazed. "They were more concerned that the elevator wouldn't
work right."</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism only crossed John Sparrow's mind briefly as he and Karen
Granger watched an eight-minute movie about the building before ascending
to the 99th floor observatory.</TE>
<TE>   "It struck me that here we are in [this skyscraper], six months after
9/11," Sparrow said.</TE>
<TE>   But his thoughts turned to the future as he and Granger, both from
Washington, D.C., looked out at the brightly lit skyline just after
sunset. He pulled out a white box, opened it to reveal a diamond ring,
and asked her to marry him. Granger, 32, said yes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking about popping the question at a restaurant later
tonight," said Sparrow, 33. But he changed his mind while taking in the
view. "We were just looking at Lake Michigan, staring at the buildings,
standing close and kissing."</TE>

<HD>House Weighs Plan on Partial Amnesty</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The bill would let some foreigners stay in U.S. as
they seek residency. Critics say rules shouldn't be eased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Six months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks postponed a brewing
debate on immigration reform, the House today is expected to approve a
measure backed by President Bush to help certain immigrants stay in the
United States while they seek legal residency.</LD>
<LD>   The House action comes after Bush prodded Republican leaders to pass
the measure before he makes a four-day swing next week through Mexico,
Peru and El Salvador.</LD>
<LD>   The measure has strong bipartisan support in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Under the bill, some foreigners who are now in the U.S. without legal
permission would be able to stay if they pay a $1,000 fee and apply for
residency by Nov. 30. Otherwise, they would be required to leave the
country to file their applications; some could face a reentry ban of as
long as 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill, which is coupled with measures to toughen border
security, would revive a temporary program that drew about 400,000
applicants before it expired April 30. To qualify, applicants had to be
sponsored by an employer or a close family member from the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Most applicants were spouses of U.S. citizens or permanent residents;
some got married in a rush to take advantage of the temporary provision.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who has sought to steer the Republican Party toward a policy of
accommodation on immigration issues, backed an extension of the program
after federal authorities were swamped with applications.</TE>
<TE>   "We should spare families the hardship of separation while one member
is awaiting a green card," Bush declared in July in a speech at Ellis
Island, N.Y. The president urged swift action on the measure, but
Congress delayed.</TE>
<TE>   A scheduled House vote Sept. 11 was canceled as Congress set aside all
business except responding to terrorism. Another attempt to move the
measure through the House was quashed in late December after critics
raised loud protests.</TE>
<TE>   But the House leadership's decision to schedule a vote today was a
clear signal that some tensions over immigration have eased. The measure
will come up under rules that require a two-thirds majority for passage.
It surpassed that threshold in a preliminary vote last May, 336 to 43.</TE>
<TE>   "From its earliest days as a republic, the United States has been a
nation of immigrants," said House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).
"The House vote . . . will send a message to the world that our country
will continue to be a beacon to all who love freedom and the opportunity
to live, work and raise a family."</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the government should not be easing immigration rules at
a time when the United States remains vulnerable to foreign attack.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be given amnesty under this plan who may in fact even be
potential terrorists," said Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.), who heads
a congressional group that advocates strict immigration limits. "We will
not have the ability to do the background checks necessary. So it's a
national security issue."</TE>
<TE>   But Tancredo acknowledged his side probably lacked the votes to
prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Before the terrorist attacks, the Bush administration and Mexico had
been discussing ways to expand legal cross-border movement--a theme
likely to come up again when the president meets his Mexican counterpart
next week.</TE>

<HD>Russian Official Had Dual Role in Uranium Pact</HD>
<DH>Security: The former nuclear chief's links raise questions about
the U.S.' decision to privatize the buying of weapon-grade chemical
element.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<AU>ALAN C. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, a small Pennsylvania consulting firm was quietly
hired by another American company responsible for carrying out a
sensitive nuclear security agreement between the United States and
Russia.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, one of the Pennsylvania firm's owners was Yevgeny O.
Adamov, who then also headed the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. At
the time, Adamov's ministry was overseeing multimillion-dollar
negotiations between Russia and USEC Inc., the same company that hired
the Pennsylvania firm.</LD>
<LD>   These circumstances have raised new questions about the U.S.
government's decision to hand a momentous national security function to
private industry.</LD>
<TE>   USEC buys bomb-grade uranium stripped from Russian warheads as the
exclusive agent for the U.S. government under a novel, post-Cold War
agreement known as Megatons to Megawatts. The uranium is shipped to the
United States, where it is resold as fuel for nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   The urgency of removing weapon-grade uranium from circulation in
Russia has been underscored since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. President Bush and other leaders have warned
that terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, are intent on obtaining
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>Adamov's Involvement Unknown, Officials Say</TE>
<TE>   USEC executives say they did not know who owned the consulting firm,
and did not learn of Adamov's involvement until he resigned his
government post last year amid allegations of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   They said the firm was hired for legitimate consulting work to
identify prospective joint ventures between USEC and the commercial arm
of the Russian atomic energy ministry. No projects were launched before
the contract expired.</TE>
<TE>   Peter R. Orszag, a Brookings Institution economist and critic of
privatizing the nuclear security agreement, said the consulting deal
involving the Pennsylvania firm reflects badly on USEC's management.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it inconceivable that the United States government would sign
a consulting contract with a firm owned by the [Russian] minister of
atomic energy," Orszag said. "Most private sector entities would not
undertake such a transaction."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law discourages companies from making private business
arrangements with public officials in foreign governments. The U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for a U.S. business to
make payments to a government official that could be construed as an
inducement.</TE>
<TE>   A USEC spokesman said the company did not violate the law, and he
noted that the contract called for the consulting firm, Omeka Ltd., to
comply with all applicable Russian and U.S. laws, including the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews and records reviewed by The Times show that USEC paid Omeka
$123,880 for consulting fees and expenses incurred from Jan. 1, 2000, to
March 31, 2001. At the same time--under terms specified in its contract
with USEC--Omeka also received payments totaling $90,000 or more from the
commercial arm of Adamov's government ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The contract ended around the time Adamov resigned from the Russian
government in March 2001. Earlier that year, an investigative report
circulated by a panel of Russia's lower house of parliament, or Duma,
alleged that Adamov had mixed his private business dealings and public
responsibilities. At the time, Adamov denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>Company Official Tells of Blind Trust</TE>
<TE>   The report noted Adamov's ownership in Omeka; The Times could not
confirm other allegations contained in the document. The report did not
refer to Omeka's contract with USEC.</TE>
<TE>   Adamov declined to respond to requests for an interview for this
article or to answer written questions submitted to him in Russia. An
Omeka executive said he did not believe Adamov received revenue from
Omeka while he was a government minister.</TE>
<TE>   "We more or less put it [Adamov's ownership] in a blind trust," said
Mark M. Kaushansky, who co-founded Omeka in 1994 with Adamov.</TE>
<TE>   Now based in Bethesda, Md., USEC once was a government-owned
corporation, like Amtrak, and it processed the nation's uranium for use
in nuclear power plants. As such, USEC had responsibility for carrying
out the Megatons to Megawatts pact with Russia. The 1993 agreement calls
for 500 metric tons of weapon-grade uranium to be stripped from the
Russian warheads, blended to a lower level of radioactivity and sold to
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   When the federal government sold USEC to investors for $1.9 billion in
1998, the privatized entity retained responsibility for the national
security agreement between the U.S. and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement calls for the publicly traded company to purchase a
certain amount of uranium each year from the Russians. But it is up to
USEC to negotiate the price for the uranium, which it resells to
utilities in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that the Russians, over a 20-year period ending in
2013, would be paid approximately $12 billion for the uranium under the
Megatons to Megawatts accord. The exact price, however, has been subject
to recurrent negotiations between the Russians and USEC.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the financial terms have been contested intensely; even a
slight shift in price can be worth huge sums to the Russian government or
USEC.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides now are trying to reach an agreement for new pricing terms,
through 2013. The negotiations got underway in early 2000--about the same
time that USEC retained Omeka.</TE>
<TE>   The discussions that led to the consulting contract between USEC and
Omeka began in late 1999. In a series of interviews for this article,
USEC executives and a representative of Adamov's company said the
dealings had no connection with the negotiations regarding the national
security agreement between the U.S. and Russian governments.</TE>
<TE>   A USEC senior vice president, Philip G. Sewell, said Omeka was
retained to provide "a speculative assessment" of opportunities with the
commercial arm of the Russian atomic energy ministry, known as Tenex.</TE>
<TE>   The contract specified that services were to be performed by "no one
other than" Kaushansky, a Pittsburgh-based representative of Omeka who is
Adamov's business partner and whose title is general manager. Noting that
Omeka is privately held, Kaushansky declined to quantify Adamov's
ownership, other than to say, "Yes, he had an equity stake in the
company. . . . He is one of the owners."</TE>
<TE>   USEC executives said they hired Omeka to gain the consulting services
of Kaushansky, a nuclear engineer and Russian immigrant who speaks
English and Russian fluently. Until the report of the Duma's
Anti-Corruption Committee began circulating, they said they had no idea
of Adamov's involvement with Omeka.</TE>
<TE>No Attempt to Identify Ownership of Firm</TE>
<TE>   Charles B. Yulish, a USEC spokesman and vice president, acknowledged
that the company did not attempt to identify the ownership of Omeka
before hiring the firm. Yulish said this was consistent with standard
practices at USEC.</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning of Adamov's involvement with Omeka, the USEC executives
said they had an in-house auditor review the contract and Kaushansky's
performance. The audit, they said, upheld the propriety of the
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing on its face or there's nothing behind the face that
warrants looking at it askance, in terms of whether monies were paid for
favors or for work that wasn't performed," Yulish said.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of Omeka was handled by Sewell, who was and remains USEC's
chief negotiator with Adamov's former ministry on the national security
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Sewell said officials from Tenex were the first to recommend
Kaushansky's services, and that he relied on their word that Omeka was a
bona fide entity.</TE>
<TE>   Kaushansky told The Times that Tenex hired Omeka at some point before
the company's contract with USEC. Sewell said he was surprised when he
learned, through the Duma report that began circulating in early 2001,
about Adamov's ownership stake in Omeka.</TE>
<TE>   Should Kaushansky have disclosed Adamov's role to USEC?</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he had," Sewell said. Company spokesman Yulish said USEC would
not comment regarding whether it would have hired Omeka if the executives
had known of Adamov's role.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Adamov's involvement with Omeka was less than a secret:</TE>
<TE>   On March 26, 1999, Energy Daily, a well-known industry publication in
the U.S., reported that Adamov, his wife and Kaushansky had founded Omeka
in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monroeville. In April 1999, this report was
cited in the Moscow Times, an English-language daily.</TE>
<TE>   Yulish said that USEC subscribed to Energy Daily. But he said the
article, headlined "Russian Atomic Minister is Card-Carrying U.S.
Capitalist," was not included in the daily summary of news clippings that
USEC distributed among its employees.</TE>
<TE>   Yulish, Sewell and USEC's general counsel, Robert J. Moore, said the
national security agreement between the U.S. and Russia encourages USEC
to pursue joint ventures with the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Kaushansky, while acknowledging Adamov's ownership in Omeka, said his
partner ceased any operational role upon becoming atomic energy minister
in 1998. "He had no control over it," said Kaushansky, who spoke with The
Times by phone and at an office building in downtown Pittsburgh.
Kaushansky said that he doubted that Adamov had been aware of Omeka's
contract with USEC.</TE>
<TE>Official Was in Position to Influence Talks</TE>
<TE>   This much is not in dispute: Adamov and his subordinates were
positioned to influence the outcome of the Russians' negotiations with
USEC regarding the Megatons to Megawatts accord.</TE>
<TE>   And in May 2000--less than five months after hiring Adamov's
firm--representatives of USEC say the Russians tentatively agreed to new
financial terms that were advantageous to USEC. However, the terms were
not ratified by both governments before Adamov left his ministry post.
They remain unresolved to this day, although USEC and Tenex recently
submitted new pricing terms to both governments. The new terms are also
considered beneficial to USEC.</TE>

<DH>Aviation: Flight 587 crash investigators find damage in another
Airbus. Ultrasound inspections ordered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Investigators probing the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in
November said Monday that they have found internal damage in the tail fin
of another Airbus A300 jet, raising questions about the visual
inspections used to certify the safety of the planes.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to the findings by the National Transportation Safety
Board, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it will require the
tail fins of A300s that have encountered severe in-flight stress to be
inspected with ultrasound techniques capable of detecting internal flaws.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said they hope the new procedures will yield more
information on the performance of the material used to construct the tail
fins, a composite of many layers of carbon fiber embedded in a special
resin and molded together under heat and pressure.</LD>
<TE>   Flight 587 crashed Nov. 12 in New York, killing all 260 people aboard
and five others on the ground. The safety board is trying to determine
whether design or structural problems, a mistake by the pilots, or some
combination of factors caused the plane's 27-foot tail fin to snap off,
making it impossible to control.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the safety board warned that pilots can unwittingly
over-stress the tail fin of any aircraft by making sharp back-and-forth
movements of the rudder.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the NTSB said that it will begin using CT-scan technology
to examine the internal condition of Flight 587's tail fin. Investigators
are focusing on six attachment fittings used to connect the tail fin to
the plane's fuselage. One of those fittings had sustained internal damage
during manufacturing, but it was repaired before the plane went into
service.</TE>
<TE>   The second damaged jet was an American Airlines A300 that encountered
severe stresses during a 1997 flight, when it nearly stalled and then
dropped about 3,000 feet before a landing in Miami. Investigators believe
those stresses may have been similar to the conditions Flight 587
encountered.</TE>
<TE>   Using ultrasound to peer into the interior layers of the composite
material, investigators discovered that some were peeling apart. The flaw
in the second jet was discovered in the right rear fitting that attaches
to the plane's fuselage.</TE>
<TE>   Precautionary visual inspections of A300s after the Flight 587
accident had failed to find the flaw. Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium that builds the planes, continues to recommend only a visual
inspection of the tail fins every five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Damaged tails are being found in aircraft other than Flight 587,"
said Lee McKague, a veteran composites engineer. "The case for periodic
ultrasonic inspection grows."</TE>
<TE>   The second jet has been taken out of service and will get a completely
new tail fin, investigators said. FAA spokesman Les Dorr said that it was
not yet clear how many other planes will have to be inspected with
ultrasound.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we are going to determine which aircraft are going to be
inspected is by a review of their service histories, to see which ones
have been exposed to upset or maneuver events," Dorr said.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said that the NTSB's finding of
internal damage on a second plane only strengthens the company's argument
that its design is sound. She noted that the plane has continued to fly
safely for nearly five years since the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a plane that went through hell and lived to tell about it, in
spades," Greczyn said. She said Airbus still stands by visual tail fin
inspections for aircraft that have been operating under normal
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   But if the second plane survived a similarly severe stress, why didn't
Flight 587?</TE>
<TE>   "That's the million-dollar question," Greczyn said. "If one stood up,
then why didn't the other?"</TE>

<HD>Man Charged With Storing Cyanide in Chicago Subway</HD>

<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>A man was charged Monday with storing deadly powdered cyanide in an
underground passage that is part of Chicago's mass transit system.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Konopka, 25, allegedly broke into a Chicago Transit Authority
storage room under the downtown district and stored sodium cyanide and
potassium cyanide.</LD>
<LD>   Officials did not say how much of the chemicals they found, and said
they didn't want to speculate about why Konopka had the chemicals.</LD>
<TE>   Konopka was charged Monday with possession of a chemical weapon and
ordered held pending a hearing Wednesday. Authorities said Konopka,
formerly of De Pere, Wis., was unemployed and had been living in the
Chicago subway system for several weeks. The FBI said he was wanted in
Wisconsin because he failed to appear on charges he vandalized power
stations in Door County.</TE>
<TE>   University of Illinois-Chicago police arrested Konopka and a juvenile
Saturday night on suspicion of trespassing, according to an FBI affidavit
filed in federal court. They were found in a steam tunnel under the
university's education building, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   University police had staked out the tunnel because of a rash of
burglaries on campus in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Konopka was carrying a vial containing sodium cyanide-sodium
carbonate, the FBI said. The juvenile told federal agents that Konopka
had taken over an area within a CTA underground passageway to store
chemicals, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Konopka told police he had keys to various CTA substations, the FBI
said.</TE>

<HD>State Rejects Briton's Death Row Clemency</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rebuffing pleas from British officials, a Georgia pardon board
denied clemency Monday to a British citizen who has been on death row in
Georgia for 16 years.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles acted after
hearing pleas on behalf of Tracy L. Housel, sentenced to death for
murdering Jeanne Drew at a truck stop northeast of Atlanta. Vera Baird, a
member of Parliament, and Sister Helen Prejean, author of the book "Dead
Man Walking," appeared before the board, as did a New Orleans attorney
who, like Housel, holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and the United
Kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Baird read a letter from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, which said
the pending execution, scheduled for tonight, had caused "pain and
anguish" in Britain, which restricted use of the death penalty about 40
years ago and outlawed it in 1998. Blair urged that the sentence be
reduced to life without possibility of parole rather than death by lethal
injection.</LD>
<TE>   The pardon board issued no statement explaining its decision.
Spokeswoman Kathy Browning said the board never discloses the tally of
its votes. "All of these cases are difficult," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Georgia reinstated the death penalty in 1976, Browning said, the
board has granted clemency seven times, while 28 people have been
executed.</TE>
<TE>   Housel's proponents cited three principal arguments on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   They said evidence discovered after his trial showed that Housel, now
43, suffered brain damage from head injuries in his youth and that he had
a history of hypoglycemia, which made him psychotic at the time he
strangled Drew shortly after meeting her in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Housel's original trial lawyer, Walter Britt, has stated
that he provided an inadequate defense to Housel and said the case has
"haunted me for years."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Housel's attorneys said he was denied due process of law
because prosecutors told the jury during the penalty phase of the trial
that he had murdered another man in Texas and assaulted people in Iowa
and New Jersey--even though he was never charged for those crimes.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, a federal appeals court in New Orleans declined to
consider the merits of that argument. Last month, however, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights said it would be a violation of
Housel's human rights to execute him since his jury had heard such
questionable evidence.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a Butts County, Ga., state court--the site of Georgia's
death row--denied a motion by Housel's attorneys seeking to stay the
execution because of the Inter-American court's action.</TE>
<TE>   Housel's attorneys, Robert L. McGlasson and Mary Elizabeth Wells, said
they were disappointed by the pardon board's decision, calling it a "slap
in the face to [the U.S.'] closest friend"--Britain.</TE>

<HD>Top 10 Reasons to Reject Disney and Stay at CBS</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>David Letterman used the opening comments of his show Monday to
tell viewers of his decision to stay at CBS, but not before getting in a
few jokes at the expense of his employer.</LD>
<LD>   Toward Ted Koppel, however, whose "Nightline" would have been pushed
aside had Letterman gone to ABC, the comedian was nothing but gracious.</LD>
<LD>   Letterman called Koppel a great "Late Show" guest who "might be too
funny for a newsman," then noted that his "contributions to American
culture speak for themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Because of his stature, Letterman continued to applause, the newsman
"at the very least . . . deserves the right to determine his own
professional future."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Letterman said he had decided to stay at CBS, although he
said it was not an easy decision--and not without repercussions. "There
goes the vacation to Disney World," he quipped.</TE>
<TE>   He opened the night's "Late Show With David Letterman" by joking that
"all of a sudden, they [CBS] can't kiss up to me enough," saying that he
"finally got a get-well card from my bypass surgery" two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he turned serious and called the contract talks "trivial,
pointless and downright silly" in comparison to the terrorist attacks of
six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the jokes quickly picked up. When he came to CBS nine years ago,
he said, the network was nothing. "We were able to build something," he
boasted, showing a clip reel that included a Stupid Pet Trick and a
Richard Simmons appearance.</TE>
<TE>   As to the negotiations with ABC, Letterman said the Disney-owned
network had "all the . . . money in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The situation got "crazier and crazier and crazier," he said, adding,
"When I drop dead there won't be this much press."</TE>

<HD>Treasury May Shift Funds to Avoid Default</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is expected to maneuver federal
employees' retirement funds to let the government avoid breaching its
borrowing limit later this month, congressional officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move--which is legal and was used by the Clinton administration in
1995--would let Congress postpone politically painful votes on raising
the current $5.95-trillion debt ceiling. President Bush and O'Neill have
repeatedly asked Congress to boost the limit by $750 billion by late
March or risk an unprecedented federal default.</LD>
<LD>   By delaying a debt-limit vote, Republican leaders could win votes for
it by attaching it to popular legislation paying for the war in
Afghanistan. Congress is not expected to be ready to pass the bill
financing the war until at least April or May.</LD>
<TE>   Though it is legal for the Treasury to maneuver the retirement funds,
it could be politically risky, with many lawmakers focused on Enron Corp.
and the demise of its employees' retirement funds.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans criticized Robert E. Rubin, who was President
Clinton's Treasury secretary, when he resorted to the same moves during a
budget showdown with the GOP-led Congress nearly seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis declined to provide specifics when
asked about plans to manage the government's borrowing needs. The plans
were described by several congressional sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working with Congress to pass an increase in the debt ceiling
and we will do whatever it takes to avoid a default should we not get"
it, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, O'Neill has the legal
power to shift money in retirement funds, invested for federal retirees
by the Treasury Department, into non-interest-bearing accounts.</TE>
<TE>   If that money is shifted, it would not count against the federal
borrowing limit. That would free up room for Treasury to borrow more
money to keep the government running. Eventually, the money--along with
all lost interest--would be put back into interest-bearing accounts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Comedy tonight" seems to be the motto at the Grove Theater Center,
where humorous plays will outnumber drama 4 to 1  in the
spring-summer season.</LD>
<LD>   "Sylvia," A.R. Gurney's popular comedy about what happens to a
happily married New York City couple after they take in a stray dog,
runs March 22-April 13. John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men," the only
drama, runs April 24-May 11. The Troubadour Theater Company, which
specializes in spoofing Shakespeare plays, offers "All's Kool That
Ends Kool," June 14-15. Larry Shue's comedy, "The Foreigner," plays
July 11-27, and "All's Well That Ends Well" will be the center's
annual Shakespearean production, Aug. 7-24.</LD>
<LD>   All shows except "All's Kool That Ends Kool" will be staged in the
indoor Gem Theater.</LD>
<TE>   Renovations to the stage shell of the adjacent Festival
Amphitheater will force the Grove to forgo its usual al fresco summer
offerings, said executive director Charles Johanson.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor theater buffs should note that all four comedies on the
Grove schedule also will be staged outdoors at the Muckenthaler
Cultural Center in Fullerton, Johanson said, with dates to be
announced. Information: (714) 741-9555.</TE>
