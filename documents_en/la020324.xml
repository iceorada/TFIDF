<HD>Andersen's Pain Will Strengthen System</HD>

<LD>The demise of the Andersen accounting firm, whether through merger or
dissolution and bankruptcy, won't be the simple banishment of an
errant company.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the resolution of the troubles of the fourth-largest
global accounting firm, with about 64,000 employees and $9.3 billion
in 2001 revenue, will set off trends both negative and positive.
Among them:</LD>
<LD>   * Accounting costs will rise sharply for U.S. and overseas
businesses, in part because of liability issues raised by the
scandal.</LD>
<TE>   * Many of Andersen's accountants will be hired by other companies.</TE>
<TE>   * Reforms growing out of the Andersen-Enron debacle will
strengthen U.S. accounting practices, which "must remain the standard
for the world," says Iwao Tomita, co-founder of Japan's Tohmatsu &amp;
Co. that became the global firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   First the costs. The federal indictment of Andersen was very
broad--too broad, say Paul Volcker, who heads Andersen's oversight
panel, along with some accounting experts and thousands of Andersen
employees who protested last week in demonstrations from Los Angeles
to Atlanta. The indictment made it practically impossible for other
firms to acquire Andersen, because they fear inheriting its
liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   So Andersen apparently will continue to lose business, as some of
its clients cancel its services and seek other accounting firms to do
their audits. More than 50 of Andersen's 2,300 clients have defected
so far.</TE>
<TE>   That is a very costly way to go, says Mark DeFond, professor of
accounting at USC. Other large accounting firms--the Big Four of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Ernst &amp;
Young--will have to grow very rapidly to handle the flood of new
work.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly they will have to hire Andersen auditors to do the
same work for clients they are doing now. But the process will
involve disruption and costs.</TE>
<TE>   A big-company audit is a huge undertaking involving hundreds of
accountants. The average audit fee for U.S. business is about
$2million a year, but typical fees at large firms run much higher
when tax services, management and information consulting are taken
into account.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies, for example, paid $54 million in audit and
consulting fees last year to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Enron, in 2000,
paid about $52 million to Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   When a company switches auditors, it can expect the new auditor to
add 50% to the work hours involved in the job. New audits done in
today's crisis atmosphere could double the tally, adding as much as
$10 billion to accounting costs for U.S. business.</TE>
<TE>   Costs will rise for other reasons as well. Regulations being
proposed in Washington would decree that a firm use different
accounting firms for general business auditing and for tax services.</TE>
<TE>   "That will hit small and medium-sized companies hard," says
DeFond, because they are used to getting a break on the cost of tax
work from the auditor who does their general accounting. Large
companies that maintain their own tax departments will be hurt less
by regulatory changes.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen employees will be hired to do new audits at their old
client firms because there is a shortage of qualified auditing talent
today.</TE>
<TE>   The highflying 1990s economy lured math-adept young people away
from the profession, accounting experts explain, even though
accounting jobs start at $40,000 to $45,000 a year and the pay
traditionally doubles every five years.</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen partners--the senior members who have equity
investments in the firm--stand to lose heavily as the firm is driven
into or near bankruptcy by settlements of lawsuits filed by Enron
shareholders. Andersen's initial offer of $750 million to settle such
lawsuits has been rejected by plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   All accounting firms face rising costs from potential lawsuits
that target accountants for not warning of financial troubles in
companies they audit, even where such troubles could not be foreseen.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 months Andersen has paid more than $350 million to
settle shareholder lawsuits. A few years ago, Ernst &amp; Young paid
$335million to settle suits over its accounting of Cendant Corp.</TE>
<TE>   These threats of rising liabilities are going to produce changes
in the profession, says accountant Richard Weisinger, who heads his
own firm in Glendale. Fees will have to rise to realistically cover
risks, he argues.</TE>
<TE>   New services will be introduced, such as a forensic audits to
guard against wrongdoing--and protect boards of directors from
lawsuits, predicts Jonathan Hamilton, editor of the Public Accounting
Report, an Atlanta-based newsletter, raising costs even more.</TE>
<TE>   It will be necessary to restore credibility to the vital function
of accounting and to keep liability lawsuits from getting out of
hand. The government oversight board being proposed by Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt could provide government
protection for the profession.</TE>
<TE>   And the accounting profession warrants protection because it is
crucial to the functioning of global financial markets and all
business transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the world has been moving toward rigorous, SEC-approved
accounting standards in recent years, because international capital
markets demand such standards, which give a clear picture of a
company's business.</TE>
<TE>   Economies that do not follow rigorous accounting standards,
including Japan's, do not succeed in today's world economy, says
Tomita, who founded the first audit company in Japan in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tohmatsu &amp; Co., Japan's Ministry of Finance supervised the
accounts of Japan's companies, often by signing off on flawed balance
sheets, and ultimately adding to Japan's current financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   But Tomita, who is 78 and retired from active management of his
firm, made his clients follow SEC-approved accounting standards. As a
result, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu grew by getting the international
accounting business of Japan's multinational companies and U.S.
companies operating in Japan. Tomita was eager for Deloitte Touche to
bid for Andersen's customer base, until the indictment made the
potential liability too uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, Andersen's accounting firm affiliates are joining KPMG,
although some of the firm's clients are coming to Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu.</TE>
<TE>   For all its safeguards, the U.S. system too became lax in the
investment boom of the 1990s. Enron's obfuscation of accounts, and
Andersen's approval of them, did not occur in isolation. Today's
investigations in the Enron-Andersen case are necessary to correct
that era's laxity.</TE>
<TE>   The painful process of Andersen's demise will help restore
credibility to investment markets and ultimately make the U.S. system
stronger.</TE>

<HD>Calls for Lawyers to Blow the Whistle</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Enron's collapse increases pressure on the legal
profession to allow lawyers to report clients' financial misdeeds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spectacular collapse of Enron Corp. is leading to renewed efforts
to alter one of the most sacrosanct relationships in America--that
between lawyer and client.</LD>
<LD>   The cloak of confidentiality that guards the relationship has
remained largely intact despite earlier attempts at reform triggered
by the implication of lawyers in a series of scandals, from Watergate
to the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.</LD>
<LD>   But questions about the performance of Enron's attorneys leading
up to the firm's collapse are prompting new calls for lawyers to blow
the whistle on a client before financial harm is done to others--in
much the same way lawyers are expected to speak up to prevent bodily
injury or death.</LD>
<TE>   The American Bar Assn. has rejected a similar proposal twice in
recent months, but a leading legal ethicist is preparing to
reintroduce a motion to allow lawyers to inform on clients who have
used their services in crimes that could cause financial damage to
creditors, clients, shareholders or others.</TE>
<TE>   Many state bar associations already have such rules in place,
lending credibility to the concept, but legal experts say the
blessing of the ABA is crucial because many lawyers defer to ABA
rules regardless of state practices.</TE>
<TE>   "This should have been a slam dunk," said Seth Rosner, a New York
lawyer who chairs the Josephson Ethics Institute in Marina del Rey
and advises firms on legal ethics. "You're not talking about good
clients. You're talking about rat clients."</TE>
<TE>   Rosner, noting that he was not referring to Enron in particular,
said he hopes the climate of reform generated by the Enron case will
help get the rule adopted this time around.</TE>
<TE>   The role of lawyers was in the spotlight this month as members of
Congress questioned Enron's legal advisors about why they failed to
raise a red flag when they were asked to look into the accounting
concerns raised by of Vice President Sherron S. Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   The post-Enron scrutiny of corporate governance also is prompting
the creation of an ABA task force on corporate responsibility and
calls for government regulation of the lawyer-client relationship.</TE>
<TE>   A group of professors from the nation's most prestigious law
schools is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a
rule requiring lawyers to notify the boards of public companies about
instances of wrongdoing that are not being addressed by management.
Such a rule would not address attorney-client confidentiality, but
would push lawyers to be more aggressive in steering clients away
from illegal acts.</TE>
<TE>   "The disclosure obligation we suggest that the SEC expressly
impose on lawyers--to tell clients' directors when they are violating
the law--is substantially less demanding than the disclosure
obligation expressly imposed by federal law on accountants," says the
letter signed by professors at 20 universities, including Harvard,
Yale, UCLA, Stanford and Notre Dame. "We hope that the SEC will also
insist that lawyers professionally represent their clients in
connection with disclosure obligations under securities laws."</TE>
<TE>   University of Illinois law professor Richard W. Painter said he
drafted the letter to the SEC after the ABA's failure in February to
make looser confidentiality rules a part of a broad revision of
professional ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer-Client Privilege a Hot-Button Issue</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt "has said in the wake of Enron, we are
looking at any and all proposals, and nothing is off the table,"
spokeswoman Christi Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   Long one of the thorniest questions facing the profession, how
lawyers should reconcile their obligation to clients with their role
in society periodically emerges as a hot-button issue and forces
change.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, ethics classes were not a part of the law school
curriculum until an appearance at a congressional hearing by John
Dean, the former White House lawyer whose testimony contributed to
President Nixon's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the panel questioned Dean about the asterisks he had
doodled next to several names on a list of key Watergate figures,
said Robert P. Lawry, director of the Center for Professional Ethics
at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "When asked about it, Dean said, 'I was just musing to myself how
many lawyers were involved,'" Lawry said. "Everybody raised hell, and
we immediately began to change the rules. I came into teaching in
1975, in the wake of all that, and ethics were mandated."</TE>
<TE>   Rosner's motion is likely to spark a debate over the question of
how closely to guard client confidentiality at the ABA's third and
final national assembly in August to hammer out the last details of a
major overhaul of its ethical canons.</TE>
<TE>   "People are truly troubled by what role the lawyer should play,"
said ABA President Robert E. Hirshon, who is assembling a task force
to examine corporate responsibility issues, including the role of
lawyers. "There is a tension between a lawyer as a strong adversary
for his or her client, and the other side, which is making sure that
the right thing gets done."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vocal proponents of maintaining strict
confidentiality rules is Lawrence J. Fox, former chair of the ABA's
ethics and professional responsibility committee. Because the law has
many gray areas, he said, clients must be able to have open
discussions with lawyers to get the best counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Without strict confidentiality rules, lawyers would have to
preface client calls with some kind of Miranda warning--anything you
say can and will be used against you, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawyers have an obligation to remonstrate their client," he said.
"Every day in thousands of situations, lawyers do that. They say 'Pay
your taxes,' 'Produce the documents.' Lawyers are regularly wonderful
at getting clients to abide by the law. That's why we want people to
consult their lawyers, and we want those discussions to be full and
free and frank."</TE>
<TE>   ABA's Ethical Canons Carry Symbolic Heft</TE>
<TE>   But Rosner, a former member of the ABA board of governors who 20
years ago argued for Fox's view, said experience has taught him that
a lawyer's advice to a client isn't always persuasive, and there are
times when a lawyer ought to be able to report imminent financial
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't tell you about crime and fraud," he said. "I've been a
business lawyer for 40 years, and they don't tell you. You discover
it and tell them, 'You have to stop your criminal toxic discharge
into the lake.' And the client tells you, 'Go jump in that lake.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nothing the ABA does is binding. The Chicago-based professional
organization's ethical canons, known as Model Rules, are examples of
professional conduct that state bar associations may follow. Unlike
the ABA, many state bars are empowered by state supreme courts to
license and sanction lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The current ABA rule says a lawyer may betray a client confidence
to prevent actions that would likely result in "death or substantial
bodily harm."</TE>
<TE>   California's rule is considered one of the strictest, closely
following the ABA model, allowing disclosure only to prevent death or
bodily injury.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 other states have loosened the rules, allowing a lawyer
to expose a client secret to prevent financial harm to others. A few
states, such as New Jersey, have gone so far as to require lawyers to
report certain financial crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they are only advisory, the ABA's ethical canons carry
symbolic heft. In the case of the confidentiality rule, Fox said, he
believes more lawyers follow the ABA guideline, regardless of the
state rules.</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly why "the ABA ought to revisit this issue in light
of Enron," said Eleanor W. Myers, a Temple University law professor
who favors loosening the confidentiality rule.</TE>
<TE>   "ABA rules count even though they are not binding," she said.
"They are the common voice of lawyers. If we suggest that
confidentiality and loyalty are the most transcendent values, then
that's what gets transmitted."</TE>
<TE>   Rosner stressed that loosening the ABA's confidentiality rule
would in no way jeopardize the laws of evidence that protect
communications involved in lawsuits and criminal cases.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Andersen Workers Reeling," March 19:</LD>
<LD>   It really bothers me that the same people who took on a
partnership structure so key employees could deduct personal expenses
are now taking to the streets in protest when the criminal liability
risk hits home.</LD>
<LD>   As if high-paid business consultants can claim to be surprised by
this. Partners at Andersen probably take deductions for everything
from driving to and from the office, meals, clothing, and laundry to
office furniture, cell phone bills and media subscriptions.</LD>
<TE>   Shredding, stalling, protesting and the like will get you nowhere.
Hundreds of thousands of other 401(k) participants, Justice and I are
standing by to make sure of that!</TE>

<TE>   Andersen officials complain that criminal proceedings will amount
to a "death sentence" for the firm ["Andersen Balks at Guilty Plea in
Enron Case," March 14]. First, why didn't they think about that
before electing to engage in criminal behavior?</TE>
<TE>   And so what if the firm dies? The world will better off without a
firm that not only sees no conflict in soft-peddling its audits of a
company so it can land lucrative consulting contracts with that
company, but is willing to go to the extreme of destroying evidence
in hopes of maintaining or expanding such contracts.</TE>

<TE>   I am not an accountant nor have I ever worked for Arthur Andersen,
but I am appalled at the Justice Department's indictment of an
organization with the effect of putting 85,000 people on the
unemployment rolls.</TE>
<TE>   A CPA who has been indicted stands little chance of ever again
practicing his or her profession of auditing a public company, or
obtaining an officer-level position with a public company.</TE>
<TE>   This may be appropriate punishment for some people in their
Houston office, but the Justice Department's action affects every
employee in every office in the United States, and some foreign
countries.</TE>

has a poor record of defining justice.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As "Airports' Growth May Spark Booms" [James Flanigan, March 7]
points out, the Los Angeles area has a very large and growing
problem, and its solution is of overwhelming importance to the whole
of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The area must have a new central airport to serve the growing need
for air transport that will reemerge when the present turmoil dies
down.</LD>
<LD>   Many sites have been suggested but they all have fatal flaws.</LD>
<TE>   Why doesn't Los Angeles follow the examples of Hong Kong and
Osaka, Japan, and build a modern airport on an island within Los
Angeles Harbor?</TE>
<TE>   With east-west runways, all approaches and departures would be
over water, and if the runways were far enough out, next to the
breakwater, the nearest homes would be miles away.</TE>
<TE>   You wouldn't have to build much more than landing strips and
airplane parking on the island.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional passenger terminals could be onshore next to the
freeways and convenient parking.</TE>
<TE>   A single means of entry, a bridge, a tunnel or monorail, carrying
only approved trucks and buses, with screened goods and passengers,
would give near-perfect security.</TE>
<TE>   Freight, the major part of which is carried in the belly
compartments of passenger planes and which composes a large portion

<HD>Late Savings Start Can End in Strong Finish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I got a very late start in saving for retirement. I know I
should be saving more now, but it's really hard. How do people save
enough for retirement while paying mortgages, car loans, tuition and
the other costs of daily life?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: By making tough choices. You're right that it can be
difficult to save for retirement with so many other claims on your
money.</LD>
<LD>   That's why financial planners constantly urge young people to
start saving for retirement with their first paychecks. The more
money you tuck away while you're young, the more freedom and
flexibility you'll have to cut back when you're older.</LD>
<TE>   It's too late for you to do that, of course. But most people can
find some way to save more if they really try.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few relatively easy ways to save money, such as eating
out less often and trimming grocery bills by paying attention to
sales. Consider driving your current car for a few more years, and
buying a used car when it's time for a replacement. These moves alone
can save you thousands of dollars each year.</TE>
<TE>   Look at your job options, as well. Some companies have better
retirement plans than others, and larger companies tend to have
traditional pensions--an incredibly valuable benefit that guarantees
you a paycheck in retirement. Some of the best pensions are offered
by government agencies, including public school systems.</TE>
<TE>   A good 401(k) plan also can speed you to your retirement goal. A
good company match--preferably in cash rather than in company
stock--would add 50 cents for every dollar you contribute, up to 5%
or more of your salary.</TE>
<TE>   If you're really in a bind, you might need to reconsider some
of the things you've taken for granted, such as the size of your house
or which schools your children attend.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller house not only would lower your mortgage, but also
reduce other home-owning costs such as maintenance and repairs. You
would have to balance the costs of downsizing--the commissions you
would pay to sell your home and buy another, plus moving costs--with
the eventual savings to determine whether it makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, your kids might need to explore less-expensive schools,
get a part-time job to help with costs or get student loans. As
you've read here over and over: Your kids can get help to pay for
college. No one's going to lend you money for your retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Collection Agencies Not Allowed to Harass</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband lost his job and we're falling behind on our credit
card payments. The collection agencies have been relentless, calling
us daily. Is there any way to make them stop?</TE>
<TE>   A: Collection agencies are not allowed to harass people in debt.
If you notify the agency in writing that you want all communication
stopped, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act requires them
to abide by your wishes.</TE>
<TE>   That's in theory. In practice, some bill collectors flagrantly
ignore the law. If yours continue to pester you, contact the Federal
Trade Commission at (877) FTC-HELP.</TE>
<TE>   You're still responsible for paying your debts,
even after quelling the collection calls. You might try contacting the
credit card companies to see whether they'll consider taking back the
accounts from the collectors and working with you on a repayment
plan. Or contact a Consumer Credit Counseling Service in your area to
see what they suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Also pick up "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your
Debts" (2002, Nolo Press), which could offer some solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring your money problem won't make it go away, and swift
action could save what's left of your credit rating. Chances are
these tough financial times won't last, but failing to act could have
long-term repercussions on your ability to get credit.</TE>

<HD>Coming Distractions</HD>
<DH>There's no escaping reality as more theater operators are
using the silver screen as a vehicle for commercials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Johnson goes to the movies to escape reality. So the Irvine High
School senior doesn't appreciate it when a soda company or automobile
manufacturer commandeers the silver screen to make a sales pitch.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't like commercials because I feel [advertisers] are just
trying to make more money off of you," the 17-year-old said. "I just
try to tune them out."</LD>
<LD>   But it will keep getting harder for movie fans to tune out the
growing presence of advertising. The exhibition industry--seeking
additional sources of revenue amid the financial woes of several
major players--clearly sees full-motion commercials playing on the
silver screen as a relatively untapped gold mine. Movie theater
operators are courting major marketers that, for the most part, have
yet to buy into the concept of using the big screen to deliver
commercials in Panavision and Dolby sound.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood traditionally has resisted sharing the movie screen with
commercials, but only a few studios, including Walt Disney Co., still
are grumbling. John Fithian, president of the National Assn. of
Theatre Owners, describes remaining opposition as "hypocritical"
because Hollywood films regularly run in European theaters where
commercials are commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the nation's 35,500 movie screens display some
sort of advertising. Low-tech slide projectors that beam messages
from community colleges, hair salons, restaurants and other local
advertisers are believed to generate half of the theater industry's
advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Movie theater operators are augmenting slide-show revenue with
audio advertising mixed in with movie soundtracks playing before the
house lights dim, as well as advertising on popcorn tubs and soda
cups. Some area theater chains have struck deals to run commercials
for the Los Angeles Times and other regional advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Theater operators and a few commercial networks hope to build upon
early success with cola companies and auto manufacturers and persuade
other free-spending national brands to run their commercials on
theater screens.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibitors are confident that moviegoers will sit still for three
minutes of advertising without getting antsy or irate. Some
executives say the total could rise to more than four minutes during
the winter holiday movie season and Memorial Day weekend, when the
industry releases its blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   Demographics clearly are the driving force behind the commercial
assault. Moviegoers who've bought tickets, snacks and soft drinks
have signaled their willingness to spend--something that's not as
apparent with consumers who hunker down at home in front of a
big-screen television.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a captive audience in a dark room with a 40-foot screen
and Surroundsound," said Todd Siegel, an executive with Screenvision,
a commercial network that matches advertisers with theaters. "At
home, a guy watches sports with a remote control in his hand, the
kids are crying, the dog is barking and the doorbell is ringing."</TE>
<TE>   Movies also draw a young audience that seems to have developed an
immunity to traditional advertising. "It's under 34 years of age
primarily, which is the perfect youth audience for us," said Steve
Sturm, vice president of marketing for the Toyota division of Toyota
Motor Sales  USA.</TE>
<TE>   Each category of films delivers a different demographic. The
recent debut film of singer and aspiring actress Britney Spears, for
example, will draw a dramatically younger crowd than a film starring
Judi Dench.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get their messages to a target audience because a
commercial can be [tied] to a specific movie rating, say, R or PG-13,
or even a specific movie title," said Ray Nutt, a United Artists
Theatre Circuit executive.</TE>
<TE>   Movie theater operators say a primary selling point is the focused
nature of their advertising venue. Clairol Inc. last summer used
movie theater screens to introduce its Herbal Essenses hair-color
line because consumers' eyes are focused on the big screen. The
theater introduction worked because "television can be very
cluttered, and this allowed us to create great buzz even before the
product was available in stores," said Andrea Davey, brand manager
for the line.</TE>
<TE>   Movie screens played a key role in a broad campaign that used
print and electronic media to promote Spears, star of Paramount
Pictures' "Crossroads" who had a new album and a concert tour to
promote. Commercials on movie screens were augmented by advertising
on popcorn bags and a tie-in to a Clairol contest that rewarded
consumers with a trip to the "Crossroads" premiere in Los Angeles.
Theaters distributed discount coupons that "bounced" moviegoers to
record stores, Nutt said.</TE>
<TE>   Initial studies suggest that moviegoers remember what they see on
the big screen. National Cinema Network, a subsidiary of Kansas City,
Mo.-based AMC Entertainment Inc., last year released a Nielsen Media
Research survey that shows consumer recall of movie commercials
dwarfs recall rates for television advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Despite exhibition industry research suggesting that consumers are
OK with on-screen commercials, the practice has generated a backlash.
Portland, Ore.-based Commercial Alert has urged moviegoers to chant
"no commercials" when advertisements are running. The consumer group
wants theaters to post times that movies begin, so patrons can opt
out of viewing commercials.</TE>
<TE>   And not everyone in the exhibition industry is convinced that
commercials belong on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I may be old-fashioned, but once the lights go down, I think the
screen should be held sacred for the moviegoers," said Dan Harkins,
chief executive of Harkins Theatres, which operates 233 movie screens
in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Harkins, a second-generation theater owner, said he's forgoing at
least a six-figure revenue stream by refusing to screen commercials.
He said his stand won't make economic sense if major chains continue
to embrace commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Harkins clearly is the exception. Three chains that entered
bankruptcy proceedings--United Artists Theatre Co., Regal Cinemas
Inc. and Edwards Theatre Circuit--now are owned by billionaire
investor Philip Anschutz, who has signaled his intent to bolster
profit from operations, in part through increased advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The industry also is getting a push from commercial networks,
including National Cinema Network and Screenvision, a wholly- owned
subsidiary of England's Thompson Multimedia. The networks hope to act
as brokers for national advertisers and theater operators.</TE>
<TE>   The commercials apparently are here to stay. Admissions and
box-office receipts hit records in 2001, but theater owners say
ticket revenue is eaten up by the high cost of renting films.
Refreshment counters and coin-gobbling video games no longer are
enough, they say, so the industry is counting on advertising to
squeeze more profit from movie theaters that the late James Edwards
Sr., a theater chain founder, once described as "million-dollar
popcorn stands."</TE>
<TE>   Concession stand profits are being augmented by revenue from slide
shows and advertising that appears on audio feeds provided by
National Cinema Network and other companies. Revenue also is coming
from huge signs being erected in theater lobbies once reserved for
colorful "coming attractions" posters.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Sales USA has used large, two-sided billboards to
advertise its new Celica and Matrix models. Clairol handed out
promotional material last summer when the company used "Bridget
Jones's Diary" and other films to introduce its Herbal Essences line.</TE>
<TE>   The number of commercials being shown on screen has grown in
recent years despite the depressed economy that has stalled overall
advertising revenue. Exhibitors say they're able to charge a premium
for on-screen commercials because movie theaters are jammed with
younger consumers who are tuning out traditional advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Marketing experts caution that consumers will tune out if the
quantity or quality of advertisements isn't carefully monitored.
"There's a fine line between commercialism and entertainment," said
Toyota's Sturm.</TE>
<TE>   Commercials that are dull, that use the hard sell or that have run
on television won't click with viewers who use the moviegoing
experience to escape reality.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers will have the last word when it comes to truly effective
advertising. Carrie Robison, 18, who regularly goes to the movies,
offers the ultimate insult to advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really remember what they were about," she said. "We
usually talk when they're running. It's like they don't filter
through."</TE>

<HD>Savings Plan Can Bring American Dream a Step Closer</HD>
<DH>Proposed legislation would make Individual Development
Accounts for the working poor more widely available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawrence Iriate ran out of financial aid a semester short of college
graduation. But the Newark, Calif., artist had an ace in the hole--an
Individual Development Account, which is a matched savings account
for the working poor.</LD>
<LD>   Iriate had set aside $500 in that account. A nonprofit group
matched his savings $2 for $1. The resulting $1,500 was just what
Iriate needed to help him become the first member of his family to
graduate from college.</LD>
<LD>   Now Iriate's wife, Michelle, is using an IDA to save for a
computer that she'll use for school and that may help the couple
start a Web-based graphic arts business.</LD>
<TE>   If a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has its way, these savings
accounts will become more common. President Bush and Sen. Joseph
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) recently proposed
a bill aimed at boosting charitable giving. A portion of the bill
sets aside $1.7 billion in federal funds for Individual Development
Accounts. That could increase awareness of the accounts and make them
more well-known and widely available.</TE>
<TE>   What are IDAs? Who can use them and where can they be found?
Here's a guide.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's an Individual Development Account?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It's a matched savings account offered only to people with
limited incomes. The accounts are offered through nonprofit
groups--many of them community-based organizations--that match
individual savings if the money is used for specific goals. Those
goals include paying postsecondary education expenses, buying a home
or starting a small business.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, participating individuals will state their goal--both
in dollar amount and the intended purpose for the savings--before
opening an account. The nonprofit group will handle paperwork,
provide financial education and send regular statements showing the
value of the participant's savings and the value of the match.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can participants withdraw their money at any time?</TE>
<TE>   A: They can take out the money they've saved, but the matching
contributions are available only after the savings goal has been
achieved. Even then, the participant does not get the money directly;
the program will send a check for the matching contribution to the
provider of the good or service that the participant designates.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if the participant's goal is to buy a home, the
matching contributions would be put into an escrow account that would
be tapped when the participant closes on a house. If the participant
is saving for school, matching contributions would be sent to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much are the matching contributions?</TE>
<TE>   A: That depends on the program. Some match 50 cents for each $1
the participant saves; others match up to $7 for each $1 saved.</TE>
<TE>   The most common match is $2 for each $1 saved, according to the
Corporation for Enterprise Development, a Washington-based group that
promotes the programs.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Who qualifies for this program?</TE>
<TE>   A: Some of the qualifications are determined by the nonprofit
groups that sponsor IDA programs. About 400 IDA initiatives are
operating through nonprofit groups nationwide, and there are IDA
programs in all but two states--North Dakota and Wyoming, said Sandi
Smith, senior program manager at the Corporation for Enterprise
Development.</TE>
<TE>   A study conducted last year by the Center for Social Development
found that the average age of enrollees in the IDA program was 36,
but some participants were as young as 13 or as old as 72. About 21%
live in households with incomes below 50% of the federal poverty
line.</TE>
<TE>   Although the programs allow accounts to be used for home
purchases, education and to develop a small business, about half also
allow matching funds to be tapped for job training or home repair.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would the proposed legislation affect the IDA program?</TE>
<TE>   A: The proposed Charity Aid, Recovery and Empowerment Act would
provide federal funding for IDA accounts opened from 2003 through
2007. It also would create federal guidelines for who could qualify
for the program and what types of savings goals IDA accounts could
fund.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the bill would restrict eligibility to partcipants
18 to 60 years old. To qualify, single applicants could earn no more
than $20,000 a year; heads of household, no more than $30,000; and
married couples, no more than $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts could be used for postsecondary education or
vocational training, first-time home-buyer costs or to start or
expand a small business.</TE>
<TE>   Participant savings would be matched on a $1 for $1 basis with
federal dollars, up to $500 a year. Additional matching amounts could
come from sources such as states and private foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How likely is this bill to pass?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's hard to say. The bill appeared to be on a fast track
when it was introduced in February but it has stalled, partly because
some legislative leaders want to craft their own version. Promoters
of the IDA program have substantial support in Congress and are
working to ensure that the proposal is passed. However, nothing is
certain.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happens if the bill isn't passed?</TE>
<TE>   A: IDA programs would continue as they are now--public-private
partnerships funded by a patchwork of federal, state, foundation and
private money, said Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where can I find a program?</TE>
<TE>   A: Go to www.idanetwork.org on the Web. There's a section that
describes the various initiatives and where to locate them.</TE>

<HD>Sam Waksal's Other Biotech Imbroglio</HD>
<DH>Research: A legal battle pits the chief executive of
ImClone against the founder of a firm he took over four years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prototek Corp. was on the brink of insolvency when businessman Samuel
D. Waksal scooped it up it in a 1998 stock swap. The tiny
biotechnology company had a stockpile of molecules that showed
promise against malaria and other diseases, but no approved drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Four years later, the deal that gave Waksal control of Prototek is
a bust. The company's most advanced project, a malaria treatment
developed with an $822,000 government grant, cured the disease in
mice but also caused them to bleed to death.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a toxic product," said Dr. Sidney L. Goldfischer, a
retired academic and consultant who oversees the company on Waksal's
behalf. Other compounds developed under the grant face years of
testing, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Goldfischer said Prototek "was a terrible investment, an unwise
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Waksal's problems at Prototek, based in Dublin, Calif., are minor
compared with the blowup at ImClone Systems Inc., where he is chief
executive. ImClone is under congressional investigation for allegedly
misleading investors about a cancer drug that has run into costly
delays. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., a large ImClone shareholder,
briefly tried to force Waksal out while the companies work out
problems with the drug. This month, Bristol-Myers received more
favorable terms on its $1.9-billion commitment to ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   The Prototek saga, unfolding in lawsuits in Alameda County
Superior Court, pits Waksal against the enigmatic scientist who
founded the company. In the middle are investors, among them wealthy
members of a Menlo Park country club who acted on a tip from a former
golf pro.</TE>
<TE>   Months after the National Institutes of Health's malaria grant
ended, Prototek dismissed Robert E. Smith, the scientist who started
the company and sold out to Waksal. Smith claims in a lawsuit that
the company fired him rather than honor promises Waksal made to him,
including a commitment to fund a pathology chair in Smith's name at
UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Prototek, in a countersuit, has accused Smith, 71, of stealing
secrets from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Prototek and Smith deny the allegations against them.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders say they haven't received a financial statement since
Waksal took over, a possible breach of California securities laws.
Two investment funds are suing Prototek, accusing the company of
stiffing them on unspecified royalty payments and a loan balance of
less than $5,000. Frank Kohles, a general partner of the funds, said
Prototek is offering stock, which he believes is of little value.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't live long enough to see a return on this," said Kohles, a
retired real estate investor in Roseville, Calif. In a separate suit,
Kohles is trying to recover an $85,000 consulting fee.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989 Prototek Was Poised for Success</TE>
<TE>   In court documents, Prototek claims it owes the investment funds
and Kohles nothing, but Goldfischer confirmed that the company is in
settlement talks with the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal didn't respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   No one seems to have made money on Prototek, which at its height
in 1990 had 36 employees. Under Smith, a talented biologist with
admittedly weak management skills, the company built a portfolio of
11 patents and isolated a trove of protease inhibitors, enzymes that
block cell growth. As of mid-2000, six of the inhibitors showed
promise in the laboratory against malaria. Among them was the
inhibitor that induced a kind of hemophilia, causing mice to bleed,
Smth said.</TE>
<TE>   Prototek appeared poised for success in 1989, when, according to
company documents, it entered a collaboration with Marion
Laboratories, now part of Aventis. Marion invested $5.25 million in
Prototek and a protease inhibitor targeting rheumatoid arthritis. The
experimental drug showed "astonishing efficacy" in rats, according to
a recent article in the chemistry journal Acta Histochemica.</TE>
<TE>   Marion gave the drug to four arthritic dogs with disastrous
results. Two dogs died within 18 hours; tests showed the chemical
caused heart, liver and kidney damage. Marion withdrew funding, and
by 1991 Prototek was down to four employees.</TE>
<TE>   Such setbacks aren't unusual in the biotech industry, but they are
a challenge for small companies funded by private individuals.</TE>
<TE>   By 1996, shareholders had lost patience with losses at Prototek. A
group of them, including golfers from the Sharon Heights Country
Club, lent Prototek $100,000 and told Smith to find a buyer, said Ken
Anderson, a retired dentist. The lenders took Prototek's patents as
collateral, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investors' frustration subsequently rose when a prospective
buyer they had recruited walked away. Biotechnology entrepreneur
Robert F. Butz, intrigued by Prototek's research, had lined up
investors willing to put $5 million into the company. But his group
insisted that Smith, then president, leave the company.</TE>
<TE>   Butz said Prototek had isolated as many as 100 protease inhibitors
that were protected by company patents, but the company functioned as
little more than a scientific boutique. Smith had "lots and lots of
molecules, but not a clue on how to take them into the clinic," Butz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith retorts that Butz, who went on to launch a gene therapy
company, "didn't have the cash" to bail out Prototek.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders privately became concerned that Smith wouldn't step
aside. A 1990 report on Prototek by consulting firm Sage Group called
Smith an "instinctive scientist ... ineffective in business affairs"
who "should be insulated from business activities."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith, who with his wife held a 52% stake in Prototek,
controlled the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the company's finances continued to deteriorate.
According to an internal memo, Prototek had "no funds to pay overdue
accounts payable [and] to fully fund continuing operations."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, Goldfischer, a scientific advisor to Smith at
Prototek, told Waksal about the company. Goldfischer had Waksal's
ear; his son, Dr. Carl Goldfischer, worked for Waksal as ImClone's
chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him the science was interesting," said Sidney Goldfischer,
professor emeritus at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal negotiated a deal that, on the surface, gave everyone what
they wanted. The company got new management--Waksal became chief
executive--and an infusion of cash to pay some bills.</TE>
<TE>   Smith gave up a management title, but received $200,000 a year in
consulting fees and an invitation to stick around as an advisor.
Waksal told Smith in a 1997 letter that his continued involvement in
the company was "a major requirement" to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that you, Robert, stay involved as a member of
both the scientific advisory board and a close consultant to the
company in order for us to feel comfortable about moving forward,"
Waksal wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he regrets listening to Goldfischer--"a friend of 30
years"--about Waksal. "It is loyalty versus money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During negotiations, Smith said, Waksal promised him "more money
than you'll ever need.... You'll never want for research funds
again." Instead, "he has not paid Prototek's [pre-acquisition]
bills," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith shouldn't complain, Goldfischer said. For years, a second
company owned by Smith and his wife, Judith Kinder Smith, sold a
product under license from Prototek. Enzyme Systems Products posts
about $1.2 million in annual sales on a chemical product used in
laboratory research while Prototek receives royalties of $60,000,
Goldfischer said. (Enzyme Systems and Judith Smith are named as
defendants in Prototek's countersuit against Smith.)</TE>
<TE>   Prototek Acquisition Gave Waksal Control</TE>
<TE>   Waksal also structured a deal between companies he controls. As
part of the Prototek transaction, a second company controlled by
Waksal licensed a Prototek patent--the one that covered the failed
arthritis drug--in return for stock that was paid to Prototek
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The value of those shares is a mystery to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't received one iota of information" since Waksal took
control of Prototek, said Anderson, the retired dentist. "I got the
feeling it was the patents he wanted, nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   California law requires companies with more than 100
shareholders--Prototek had 113 at the time of the stock swap--to
issue annual reports. But stockholders must sue to enforce the law
and violators face a maximum fine of just $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the Prototek acquisition gave Waksal almost complete
control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1998 offering memorandum, Waksal and his investment
partner, New York financier Arthur G. Altschul, control Prototek
through a special class of voting stock.</TE>
<TE>   When the deal closed, their combined 12.4% of common equity
controlled 77.9% of the votes.</TE>
<TE>   Other shareholders ended up with less power than before.</TE>
<TE>   Pistachio grower Samuel Webster, whose family sank $140,000 into
Prototek, isn't happy but he's holding his fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have more information about what is going on.... I
want to be careful about what I say," he said. "I don't count it as
an asset on my financial statement. But, as far as I am concerned,
[Waksal] is the last chance of getting my money back."</TE>

<LD>Andersen Affiliates Bolt for Rival Firms</LD>
<LD>   The Andersen accounting firm's efforts to transfer its overseas
operations to KPMG frayed when three foreign affiliates bolted for
rival companies and a senior Ernst &amp; Young executive launched a
campaign to pick off Andersen practices worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen partnerships in Hong Kong and China said they planned to
merge with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Russian practice plans to
merge with Ernst &amp; Young.</LD>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young also is interested in the rest of Andersen's
non-U.S. affiliates, Chief Executive Bill Kimsey said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the proposed takeover of the No. 4 accounting
firm by Andersen's oversight board, chaired by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker, hinges on the Justice Department dropping
criminal charges and partners approving.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said he wants an agreement in principle to settle
class-action lawsuits over Andersen's auditing of Enron Corp. before
his board takes over the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Drops Recession Warning</TE>
<TE>   Moving to manage a reviving American economy, Federal Reserve
policymakers took a first step toward raising interest rates,
dropping their position that a recession is the nation's biggest
economic danger.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the central bankers left their key, signal-sending
interest rate at a four-decade low of 1.75%. But they accompanied
their decision with word that they believe the risks no longer are
tilted toward recession, but are balanced with the danger of
excessive growth.</TE>
<TE>   HP Moving Ahead With Compaq Merger</TE>
<TE>   After claiming victory in a hard-fought proxy battle,
Hewlett-Packard Co. appears to have the go-ahead to acquire Compaq
Computer Corp., though official results won't be in for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   What sold many of the large institutional shareholders, which
sided with HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina against dissident
director Walter Hewlett, was the unprecedented effort HP and Compaq
put into planning how the two firms would mesh.</TE>
<TE>   But execution of the integration will be critical if HP is to
avoid the prolonged decline Hewlett and many HP employees fear.
Mergers of large technology companies typically do not live up to
management expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Panel Calls for New Accounting Watchdog</TE>
<TE>   In one of its final acts before disbanding, an accounting
oversight board called on Congress to create an independently funded
watchdog agency that would have the power to set accounting standards
and punish auditors for wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal by the Public Oversight Board--a private-sector panel
created in 1977 to help oversee the accounting industry--presents a
challenge to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt's reform package, which seeks an oversight board with greater
industry involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the board's rival proposal, a newly created Independent
Institute of Accountancy would consolidate all rule-making and
enforcement powers in a single agency, operating under SEC
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Memo Says Asbestos Touted for Paper Use</TE>
<TE>   A document recently discovered through litigation describes
efforts by Union Carbide to promote the use of asbestos in facial
tissues.</TE>
<TE>   The memo, believed to be from the late 1960s, indicates that Union
Carbide sold asbestos to at least one paper manufacturer for use in
facial tissues.</TE>
<TE>   Paper companies are among the latest targets of asbestos lawsuits.
Lawyers representing victims of asbestos-related diseases discovered
the memo several months ago in a Union Carbide document repository.
They are investigating and have pressed tissue makers to disclose
whether they used asbestos in consumer products.</TE>
<TE>   Paper maker Kimberly-Clark Corp. acknowledged that it bought
asbestos from Union Carbide but used it in paper for sandpaper
backing, not in Kleenex.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's to Open 30 Stores in Southland Debut</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's Corp., the rapidly growing department store chain, will
make its long-expected push into Southern California in March 2003,
with plans to open at least 30 stores on a single day, according to
developers, city planners and retail experts familiar with Kohl's
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., has declined to give
specifics about its plans. But developers and government officials
say they have identified about a dozen sites at which Kohl's is in
various stages of permitting and development, including three in Los
Angeles County, four in Orange County and three in the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's is building a warehouse in San Bernardino to support the
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's operates more than 380 stores in 29 states, but none in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Home Sales Surge in Southern California</TE>
<TE>   Home sales surged last month across much of the Southland, lifting
prices for almost every type of housing and setting the market on a
scorching pace through the early part of the year that is ahead of
last year's record..</TE>
<TE>   Sales of existing homes, condominiums and new homes jumped 21% in
Los Angeles County, marking the best February since the previous boom
in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The median price, or the point at which half the homes sell for
more and half for less, was a record $237,000, up 15% from a year
earlier, according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Is Going Back on the Wagon</TE>
<TE>   General Electric's NBC television network said it will stop
accepting advertisements for hard liquor, returning to network
television's 54-year-old practice of abstaining from such ads.</TE>
<TE>   NBC executives apparently realized that the company had more to
lose in breaking this taboo than it had to gain, especially after
Congress announced it would hold hearings.</TE>
<TE>   In December, NBC broke ranks with CBS, ABC and Fox to be the first
national broadcast network to run hard-liquor advertising. Struggling
with the advertising recession, NBC had hoped it could tap more than
$100 million in new ad revenue, said Jerry McGee, president of the
Los Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, which
represents liquor companies.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Confirms Cuts in Animation Staff</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Studios Animation President Thomas Schumacher
officially informed his senior executives and top creative staff of
plans to lay off as many as 265 employees at its Burbank facility
over the next year.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts, which will reduce the staff to about 1,000 by May 2003,
are part of Walt Disney Co.'s retrenchment of its cornerstone
animation business.</TE>
<TE>   The animation industry is redefining itself at a rapid pace as
computer-generated movies overshadow those made in the traditional
hand-drawn style Disney invented.</TE>
<TE>   EMI Slashes Jobs, Drops 400 Acts</TE>
<TE>   EMI Group announced a massive overhaul, slashing 1,800 jobs and
dropping 400 acts to cut costs and stem losses at the struggling
British music giant--home to such stars as Garth Brooks and Janet
Jackson. Nearly one-third of the layoffs will be in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic restructuring, in which about 20% of EMI's work force
will be cut, is expected to deliver annual savings of about $140
million, the company said.</TE>

<DH>ODE TO LATA: A Novel, by Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla, Really Great
Books: 288 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. CARLILE</AU>
<BD>D.J. Carlile is a critic, playwright and translator.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ode to Lata" is quite an achievement. In his first novel, Ghalib
Shiraz Dhalla traces the history of a life over three continents,
through three generations of a family, exploring multiple facets of
human sexuality in the process. From India to Kenya to Los Angeles,
the book's varied strands converge in the person of Ali, whose story
it is.</LD>
<LD>   Ali's family is from India, but he was born in Kenya, where his
grandparents had settled. He is Muslim by upbringing but his Hindu
roots are not far from his heart. The films of Bollywood are the
template of his dreams. These fantastical musicals, featuring
melodramatic love stories in which the lovers scarcely embrace, much
less kiss or copulate on-screen, are a staple of Indian culture. Song
lyrics from these florid epics are scattered as commentary on Ali's
disarrayed love life: "poignant lyrics that epitomize the suffering
of love and which only Lata can sing.... Imagine Ralph Fiennes
lip-syncing Michael Bolton when carrying his dead lover out of the
cave, only to be met with the rest of the cast ... equally bereft, in
a full production number. That's Bollywood."</LD>
<LD>   In his early teens, Ali discovered he was gay, and his eventual
move to California is an attempt to find a life of his own where he
is not expected to marry and raise a family. His mother looms over
his life as a reminder of what his "native community" expects of him.</LD>
<TE>   Ali's father, an attractive womanizer, was murdered by his jealous
mistress when Ali was 6, and memories of violent quarrels between his
"loving parents" have stuck in Ali's memory: "There is pandemonium in
the room. I stand barefoot, crying hysterically in my flimsy vest and
underpants and look up at these two larger-than-life people going
amok. There is shouting and screaming and a lot of movement, and it's
very confusing and I can't understand what's going on. I only know
that it's bad. I cry harder ... I know I see blood ... everywhere it
seems. On the wall. On their hands. On their faces. In the mind. I am
standing in the middle of the room. Can't they see me? Why aren't
they protecting me from all this?" Ali's grandparents, too, have
spent their long life verbally sparring and attacking each other. He
is understandably wary of heterosexual relationships from an early
age. In his child's mind, these are bound up with anger, jealousy,
tears, reproaches and blood.</TE>
<TE>   The book's style is conversational yet confessional. When his
mother visits from Kenya, he temporarily shelves his night life and
meditates: "[A]lthough I didn't doubt how much she and my father had
loved me, their parenting had been a sanctioned debacle of neglect at
best. And now, years later, with him six feet under and her
enraptured in religion, I had been left with huge holes in my heart
... which, I had been convinced for so long, could only be filled by
someone exactly like my father. How to tell her all this without
breaking her heart?"</TE>
<TE>   The night life of West Hollywood--the rounds of drinking,
cruising, drugs, dancing and sex--is not glamorized. "When first
treading into gay Los Angeles, one of the rudest shocks had been that
opposites didn't always attract. The clones were looking for clones.
The buff men were looking for other buff men. And the most popular of
them all, the tops, were looking for bottoms who, alas, looked like
tops. Only the queens weren't looking for their own kind.... When
night falls on Santa Monica Boulevard, a modest stretch of its
cadaver begins to take on a shadowy kind of life ... as early as
dusk.... [W]hen darkness finally cloaks its pavements and bus benches
... it actually starts to surge and ripple ... a visible procession
of sexual trade. The drivers stealthily ... search out those they
will not acknowledge by day. Here they will find a menagerie of
sexual creatures to expiate them from the churning in their bellies.
Here they will find the seeming virgin ... the jaded man ... and the
homme fatale who, by the nature of his handsome looks, is fated to
leave for other loves and lands."</TE>
<TE>   Ali is a romantic at heart and is drawn to men who must be pursued
and seduced. He has little skill in maintaining a relationship that
is nurturing and sexually charged. He complains to his fellow
expatriates about the incomplete nature of his love life. They, in
turn, cluck their tongues and sigh along with him in a roundelay of
sympathy and sarcasm: "Chatting away in an orgy of different
dialects--Gujarti, Hindi, Urdu....The sweet exaggerated vernacular
... The sardonic appreciation and extraction of camp from the world
of Hindi cinema. The nostalgic, melancholy strains of 'filmi' music;
and the evergreen voice of Lata Mangeshkar."</TE>
<TE>   This story resonates for any and all of us. We are often stuck in
roles of failure that we blame on our childhoods or find ourselves in
relationships that collapse due to unrealistic expectations. We are
often creatures of self-deception and self-inflicted misery. "Ode to
Lata" engages cultural differences and the loathing dismissal
engendered by racism and intolerance. Ali himself demeans his
lifestyle and his less-than-perfect body, his ethnic "otherness" and
needy emotional hunger.</TE>
<TE>   The morning after a wild night, he's consumed with disdain while
his bed partner is in the shower: "We had met in some dark corner at
a sex club where he could barely make out what I was. I might have
even seemed Latino to him at some point. But now, with daylight
intruding through the blinds ... [a]ll those images of 7-Eleven
salesmen and heavily accented sing-song dialects would have come
flooding into his mind and maybe he would have cringed.... I can't
seem to remember exactly when it all started. This shame.... Perhaps
it's all the result of being born in the shadows of colonialism.
Imagine growing up in a country where being white automatically meant
that you were entitled to the privileges that everyone else had to
struggle for."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the book, Ali thinks of India's fate and how the Moguls
and then the British made their mark. "Two very different cultures
with one very virulent trait in common, their puritanism, had ruled
India. An epoch of lavish sexuality had been expunged ... Suddenly
what was natural had nothing to do with our ancestors ... Centuries
of history were suddenly consigned to oblivion ... Exported to the
West ... India and her legacy had been prostituted not only by
outsiders, but by her own children. They had reduced her to a
commercialism about pungent spices, gods and goddesses with multiple
limbs and heads, and the movies ...."</TE>
<TE>   Dhalla writes: "Passion thrives on many annihilating emotions.
It's fueled by catalysts so fickle, so fleeting, that the promise of
lasting love is never one of them." This is a book of healing, of a
soul coming to terms with itself and the body and mind it inhabits.
This novel allows the so-called "straight" world a more intense
glimpse into the male gay lifestyle than similar efforts, for it is
told by an "outsider" who is deeply enmeshed in gay culture--one who
is part of the scene, but stands at a distance, waiting and wishing
to belong somewhere, anywhere.</TE>

<AU>DAVID FREEMAN</AU>
<BD>David Freeman is a screenwriter and the author of "A
Hollywood Education," "One of Us" and other books.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Los Angeles, script reading can be a badge of honor, a sign of
position. "Don't bother Mommy now, she's reading scripts." The little
tyke is expected to back off, knowing there's no appeal. Mommy's
mired in her "weekend read," plowing through scripts of unproduced
movies. It means Mommy's important.</LD>
<LD>   Now another kind of script is gaining a new popularity: the
published versions of movies already made and in some cases even
playing at the multiplex.The volumes are traditional paperbacks with
snappy covers, usually with a still from the movie cropped in a way
that probably gives pause to the cinematographer. The treatment of
the text ranges from what looks like photocopied pages from the Mommy
version, full of terms of art: POV, smash cut and even the occasional
n.d. sedan (for nondescript). Others have the slick surfaces, easily
read typeface and layout of the big publishing houses.</LD>
<LD>   A film script, if it is ever produced at all, is produced only
once, unlike its cousin the stage play, which may be done many times
in many different styles. If a film is remade, a new script is
written. A strange counter-example is the remake of "Psycho." Gus Van
Sant, an otherwise exemplary director, made a point of shooting
Joseph Stefano's original script and repeating Alfred Hitchcock's
camera angles. The result was stillborn, more an art student's stunt
than an independent work.</LD>
<TE>   Published scripts date to the silent era. An early example is
"Just a Song at Twilight" by Henry Albert Phillips, published in 1921
by the Home Correspondence School, an organization that must have
been selling screenplay lessons even then. Publishing scripts hit a
peak in the late '60s, when art house scripts were published here and
abroad by Lorrimer, Grove and others. That was an era before
videotape and DVD, when reading the script was the only practical way
to examine a movie.</TE>
<TE>   So who reads these scripts? As the old joke has it, everyone has
two businesses: his own and show business. Interest in Hollywood and
its lore has never been greater. In many cases, I suspect, these
scripts are the equivalent of action figures for grown-ups. People
often want to own a souvenir of a movie they've liked. Published
scripts serve as a memento with more gravitas than a T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Film students read them, trying to divine their mysteries. Writers
collect them, looking for models. Academic presses publish them,
heavily annotated with variant scenes and essays. The magazine
Scenario has been publishing current scripts (three per issue) since
the mid-1990s. Many scripts pop up on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Actors and acting students do scenes derived from these published
versions for auditions or in class. A generation ago, in New York,
young actresses often did Viola's ring speech from "Twelfth Night"
("I left no ring with her...."). They had probably played the role in
college. They were pitting themselves against 400 years of tradition,
hoping to hit all the right notes and perhaps add a bit of their own
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in Los Angeles anyway, they might do a scene from "Erin
Brockovich," throwing themselves up against Julia Roberts. They
usually do better with the Shakespeare. One can hear the ring speech
done many ways. It's part of our common literature, and anyone may
take a whack at it. Erin belongs, body and soul, to Roberts, and
anyone else seems a pale imitation.</TE>
<TE>   A similar dilemma exists with reading film scripts for pleasure.
When reading a play, you are free to imagine anyone in the roles. If
you were to read, say, "Red River," it would be hard to picture
anyone but John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the scripts published today are "shooting scripts," a term
that used to mean the script that started production, the so-called
blue pages, the final revision. Now, in this new publishing sense,
it's a record of the production. Hollywood scripts go through many
drafts, often with contradictory purposes. A script that someone is
hoping to sell to a studio (the selling draft) might have baloney
along the lines of "It's metal against flesh as the cyborgs attack
the giant strippers. Good golly, Miss Molly, what a fight!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the star's draft, designed to flatter a big player,
which might say something like, "The most gorgeous woman ever seen
walks into the room. She radiates intelligence and wisdom." The
writer, presumably, imagined a grand star reading that and thinking,
"Hey! That's just like me. I think I'll say yes." There's often a
director's draft that might say something like, "Put director's chase
here." The budget draft, that is meant to make an expensive
proposition sound flexible, might say something like, "It would be
swell if we could have six camels in this scene."</TE>
<TE>   The published version will have none of that but might include the
work of other writers, ad libs and improvisations. So Mommy, absorbed
in unproduced scripts to the exclusion of her family life, is not
reading what you can buy at the bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   All those "Mommy's busy" scripts, which emerge from laptops in
coffee shops and keep a part of the city's economy humming, provide a
certain excitement. A reader never quite knows what will be on the
next page. Will it be clever? Exciting? Idiotic? Misspelled? No
matter how many of these untried scripts one reads, they always
contain a mixture of dread and possibility that is not a part of the
published versions.</TE>
<TE>   The first published screenplay I can recall reading was Dudley
Nichols' script for "Stagecoach," which I had recently seen. It was
included in "20 Best Film Plays," a 1930s anthology. I had never seen
a script and had no particular ambition to write one. It must have
been curiosity, or perhaps I had come across this already aged volume
in the library. I recall that it held my interest but was only a
shadow of the movie I had liked so much. The question that I didn't
yet know to ask was, "If I had read 'Stagecoach' before I had seen
it, what sort of reaction would I have had?"</TE>
<TE>   I was pondering that conundrum when the Faber paperback of
"Storytelling" all but fell on my desk. The movie, written and
directed by Todd Solondz, was in the theaters, though I had yet to
see it. I knew Solondz to be the definition of an independent
filmmaker: quirky and idiosyncratic, often unpleasant, more widely
reviewed than distributed and a man with a particular voice.</TE>
<TE>   I encountered a sly meditation on the nature of narrative. The
first part is set around a university creative writing class and some
earnest student stories that hewed closely to quotidian events,
mostly to do with two sour love affairs. The second part has to do
with documentary filmmaking, documented situations and extravagant
theatrical events: fires, hypnosis, wild strokes of luck and
misfortune. Very much a writer's script.</TE>
<TE>   When I saw the movie, the writing still felt well drawn, and the
ideas were certainly there, but the whole business felt exasperating
and a little heavy, though it had more humor than I had recognized.
Could it be that it had less power for me because I read it first? It
is a question that by its nature is unanswerable.</TE>
<TE>   The opposite of "Storytelling" might be "A Beautiful Mind," Akiva
Goldsman's adaptation of the life of the mathematician John Nash.
It's a big-studio script, an example of what Europeans mean when they
speak, sometimes with hostility but usually wistfully, of Hollywood
craft. It's about mental and mathematical dilemmas, and it marches
along with a bright clarity that is teasingly revealing. It plays
well and reads well, which is unusual. It's my bet to win an Oscar in
tonight's little hootenanny.</TE>
<TE>   "The Matrix," written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, is
a stylish sci-fi story filled with eye-popping special effects. It's
an exception to the "shooting script" designation. The authors
explain they are using the term in the earlier sense, of the version
that went into production. Does any of it come alive on the page?
Well, yes and no. The action is clearly described. The meaning is
often clearer than it is on the screen, but there's no juice in it.
It really does feel like a technical document. The pictures from the
movie are a help, though.</TE>
<TE>   Should we expect a written script to be as compelling as the
filmed version of it? They're different forms, with different
imperatives. If you want a look at some good ones, I'd suggest
reading the scripts that Samson Raphaelson wrote for the Ernst
Lubitsch movies of the 1930s, particularly "Trouble in Paradise" and,
best of all, "The Shop Around the Corner" which is as near to
perfection as this tattered art can achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Running a close second are Preston Sturges' scripts from the early
'40s, particularly "Sullivan's Travels" and "The Lady Eve." Of
course, it helps to picture Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda in the
latter, not that anyone who has ever seen the movie could forget
them.</TE>
<TE>   Scripts from the 1930s and '40s are from an era before location
shooting was commonplace. Special effects were minimal. The archness
of black-and-white film shot on sound stages is closer to the theater
than to contemporary pictures. Scenes were allowed to run on a bit in
contrast to today's shorter, punchier ones; combined with the natural
wit of the period, they can make us feel as if we're eavesdropping on
a cocktail party.</TE>
<TE>   The recent Writers Guild contract calls for a payment for the
right to publish a script as part of a DVD. The payment was achieved
as a way for the guild to squeeze a little more money out of the
studios without establishing a precedent for the other guilds. So
far, no one seems to have exercised this right, though one can
imagine a day when you can read the script on the DVD with links to
the film. Read a scene, click a few clicks and see how it plays.</TE>
<TE>   A modern script usually has little in the way of language and only
a shadow of character. Performances make scripts sing. Movies are
kinetic, crammed with information that seems to change all the time.
The good ones are alive. A book is stable. That's its nature. The
life in it is in the words, permanently nailed to the page.
Publishing scripts sometimes seems an attempt to tame a wild thing.
It does little more than create artifacts of the cinema nation.</TE>

<HD>Sex and the Single-Minded</HD>
<DH>NIGHT GAMES: And Other Stories and Novellas, By Arthur
Schnitzler, Ivan R. Dee: 272 pp., $28.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER GAY</AU>
<BD>Peter Gay is the author of, most recently,
"Schnitzler's Century: The Making of Middle-Class Culture,
1815-1914."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Schnitzler is not nearly so familiar to American readers as he
should be, and this has led to starkly differing views of his
literary stature. In a brief foreword to "Night Games," John Simon
places him "in the vicinity of Proust, Joyce, and Chekhov," while
Phyllis Rose, in the New York Times Book Review, dismissed him as "a
relatively obscure Austrian writer."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Schnitzler has no "Ulysses," no "A la recherche du temps
perdu," no "Cherry Orchard" to his credit. He considered himself (as
Simon notes) an author of the second rank, and that is the level that
is really appropriate to him, even though, in his time and after his
death (he was born in Vienna in 1862 and died in Vienna in 1931),
Schnitzler was as celebrated as Hugo von Hofmannsthal and more
controversial, and enjoyed higher prestige, than Stefan Zweig.</LD>
<LD>   This volume, containing nine Schnitzler stories, can do its bit in
whatever revival of Schnitzler among American readers one can hope
for. These tales, short and long, date from almost four decades, from
1894 to the year of Schnitzler's death (it would have been helpful if
the publisher had taken the trouble to give publication dates for
each of them), and offer a fair sample of his preoccupations. The
translation is competent, so that "Night Games" can build on the
half-dozen or so collections of his work now available.</LD>
<TE>   Schnitzler was the eldest child of an eminent Viennese nose and
throat specialist of Jewish heritage and cosmopolitan, humanistic
convictions. A good son in his individualistic way, he trained as a
physician in his father's specialty even though, as soon as Herr
Professor had died and his literary ventures were beginning to find
echoes, he abandoned his medical practice--what he had most enjoyed
about it was the opportunity to meet pretty, eminently seducible
patients--and became a full-time writer of novels, novellas, short
stories and dramas.</TE>
<TE>   His range was narrow, even though it widened around the turn of
the century, when anti-Semitism had become an irritating, even
frightening ideology in the Austro-Hungarian Empire; Schnitzler's
most interesting play, "Professor Bernhardi" (1908), courageously
tackled this unsavory subject. But even in his unpolitical years,
Schnitzler's psychological penetration could be impressive.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite formula--we encounter it several times in this
volume--was an adulterous affair and its consequences, which he
served up, wittily, in an imaginative variety of ways. Often he
capped his tales with a surprise ending but, being the sensitive
psychologist he was, he should not be dismissed as a mere Austrian
version of O. Henry. He experimented with stylistic innovations such
as stream-of-consciousness and its near relative, the internal
monologue. Several of the stories gathered here have principal
characters talking to themselves, exhibiting subtle shifts of
feelings and moods. More, he was blunt about sexual entanglements and
about the social hypocrisy, the sheer cruelty, that turned so many of
his dramas into tragedies, especially when the love affair crossed
class lines. No wonder that Freud, that other Viennese explorer of
contemporary sexuality, thought so highly of Schnitzler.</TE>
<TE>   Yet their explorations were only superficially alike. Freud
attempted to cover the entire menu of sexual desire, its failures and
successes--impotence and frigidity, homosexuality and fetishism and
other forms of gratification whereas Schnitzler shows little interest
in the diversity of erotic pleasure. He has virtually no room for men
who cannot, or women who do not want to, perform. What interests him
most are the social conflicts and internal stresses that illicit love
is bound to produce in a society that (at least officially) cherishes
the marriage bond; he makes much of the clash between the demands of
passion and the constraints of law and custom. In manipulating this
cluster of themes, Schnitzler can appear as cold as a surgeon, as
cynical as a worldly-wise roue.</TE>
<TE>   The most remarkable instance of his preoccupation with sex without
love is the play "Reigen," written in the winter of 1896 and
unplayable for years because of its "obscenity." It is a brilliant
parade of couples about to engage in, and commenting afterward about,
sexual intercourse, with each episode featuring one of the partners
from the previous one, until in the end, after 10 encounters, the
erotic circle is complete and the round dance of sex is over
(recently the play briefly appeared, under the title "The Blue Room,"
on Broadway).</TE>
<TE>   One adjective that may come to mind, then, as one reflects on
Schnitzler's sizable oeuvre, is "dated." After all, since the end of
World War II, our moral imperatives seem to have visibly shifted,
with virginity less highly valued and class distinctions less
clear-cut than before. But a more appreciative, and more accurate,
verdict on Schnitzler would be, apart from the pleasure that his
erotic imagination can give, the fascinating glimpses he provides
into a world that has largely been destroyed in a century of wars and
genocide. Love and sex and death wear many garments and can be
interesting in them all, including the ones that Schnitzler dresses
them in.</TE>
<TE>   This perspective on Schnitzler should throw light on problems that
(to my mind) diluted the effect of Stanley Kubrick's much discussed
film "Eyes Wide Shut," closely based on a long Schnitzler story of
1926, contained in this volume and here called "Dream Story." For
reasons best known to him, Kubrick moved the dramatic date of this
novella to the present and the scene from Vienna to New York. This
gratuitous transformation destroyed the distance in time and place
that would have made the film a self-contained historical tale
unburdened by the question of verisimilitude--is this really New
York? Do doctors make house calls any more?--that put off so many
viewers. But it is about time we get over debating Kubrick's last
film, and about time, too, for the American reading public to get
over thinking of Schnitzler as a relatively obscure writer.</TE>

<AU>HERBERT GOLD</AU>
<BD>Herbert Gold is the author of, most recently, "Daughter
Mine," "Haiti, Best Nightmare on Earth" and "The Age of Happy
Problems."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time in the tingling world of literary reviewing, the
intellectual concept of "first" thrived. There were first novels,
first collections of stories, first books of poetry.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, gone now. Nostalgia for honest enumeration tugs at my soul
under the malignant impact of phrases such as "his debut novel," "her
debut collection." Reading about debuts calls up visions of the proud
father of the writer waiting to have the first dance with his
debutant in his or her pink chiffon. What virus has brought debut
blight to the useful task of book reviewing?</LD>
<LD>   A clue can be found in a usage note in the American Heritage
Dictionary, which suggests that "debut" is "well-established in
connection with entertainment and the performing arts ... not
entirely acceptable when used in other sorts of introductions ...
probably because of the association of the term with show-business
publicity."</LD>
<TE>   Association with the term evokes a twilight reception at a nice
hotel; perhaps the band is playing "Volare." The new novelist is
wearing a strapless gown and tears are shining in parental eyes as
the shy debutante parades down a stairway, clutching not a corsage
but ... a novel which rips the lid off racial hypocrisy? A lyric
paean to the smell of bootleg whiskey in the hollows of Appalachia?
Of course, there is also a well-established tradition of violinists,
singers and other performers making their debuts, after much
practice, at Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The dictionary suggests what is going on here. Writing is being
treated like a performing art and the new writer like a creature
emerging from the pupa stage because that's where the engines of
publicity take their models. Perhaps the term "debut" applied to
publication on paper began as a charming metaphor, comparing writers
to youngsters heading with formal presentation into the adult world
of defloration. But why give up the tougher notion of a "first novel"
with all its magic promise of perhaps a second and third to follow?
Please, let's not think of the second or third book as an "encore."</TE>
<TE>   "Debut" isn't the only problem. There is also "riveting," as in
"this riveting tale of life on the mean streets of Poughkeepsie, New
York." It evokes the hammering clang of a metal bolt to indicate the
effect on our metabolisms of an engrossing narrative. Agreed, when it
was new the term could suggest strong, moving, enthralling ... a good
read. I began to make note of the times the term is used by one
frequent reviewer and stopped when I ran out of paper. (So much to
complain about, so little paper.)</TE>
<TE>   "Riveting" has degenerated until it means: "Here's a thriller
which will pass the time OK" or "This is the best expose of Henry
Kissinger's naughtiness I've read this week." (I choose not to
mention the critic's name out of fear that she or he will be mean to
my new book about finding paradise in Provence or maybe Tuscany, a
groundbreaking evocation of the authentic smells of fearless cooking
with garlic.)</TE>
<TE>   Interested readers could go to my Website to find further
denunciations of both "debut" and "riveting" plus "hopefully" to mean
"I hope," except that I don't have a Website.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Stafford of blessed memory, novelist, story writer and
critic, posted a sign outside her cottage, warning all visitors:
"Hopefully Not Spoken Here." The use of the adverb "hopefully" to
mean "I hope" is the death of language terminally.</TE>
<TE>   A few other words, once healthy metaphors, now reviewing cliches,
need to be pensioned off. "Trademark," for example, as in "Tom
Wolfe's trademark white suit" or "John Grisham's trademark legal
detail." Hitting the "trademark" key on the computer to suggest a
dominating familiar image or habit has become a lazy writer's quick
fix. The same flaccidity expresses sarcasm with the parenthetical
expression ("wink wink, nudge nudge"). Or crams information into a
name, as we would never do in speech, jamming our circuits, as if the
information is a title like Senator or Herr Doctor Professor: "San
Francisco Asian American Novelist Amy Tan." Why not put this news
into the normal rhythm of healthy American discourse? asks
curmudgeonly Cleveland-born San Francisco resident Herbert Gold.</TE>
<TE>   This is not my debut as a public whiner, but hopefully it will not
become my trademark either.</TE>

<DH>LOVING MONSTERS, By James Hamilton-Paterson, Granta Books:
308 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>

Daily Telegraph.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional literary wisdom nowadays decrees that, in fiction
particularly, the author is irrelevant to the work produced.</LD>
<LD>   James Hamilton-Paterson, the author of "Loving Monsters," has
great fun standing this notion on its head. His narrator--also named
James--includes in his acknowledgments thanks to persons who recur as
characters in his text. James is researching the biography of a
mysterious but elegant old codger called Raymond Jerningham Jebb,
known as Jayjay: the first thing we're confronted with is a full-page
photograph of Jayjay's tombstone, complete with name and dates of
birth and death. His death also rates a mention among the book's
acknowledgments. The Italian town where Jayjay, James and (it would
seem) their author live, Castiglion Fiorentino, exists on the map.
Other photographs, including shots of family members and local
scenes, are scattered through the text. What are we supposed to make
of all this?</LD>
<TE>   Though he has been writing fiction for 30 years, Hamilton-Paterson
is a singularly elusive character. What we learn from various dust
jackets and his other books only adds to one's perception of his
elusiveness. He was born in 1941. He studied at Oxford, but we're not
told what. He also won the Newdigate Prize there (a distinction he
shares with Oscar Wilde), but we're not told when. (Research shows it
was in 1964, when he was 23, which suggests graduate status.) On
internal evidence he's clearly a globe-trotter. He writes a science
column for Das Magazin in Zurich. One of his books, listed as
"children's fiction," is in fact a terrifyingly internalized account
of a neglected and institutionalized child. His poetry is complex,
quasi-surrealistic and subversive of surface appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton-Paterson also writes extremely well, and the tributes to
him from various literary figures are well-deserved. In 1989 he won
the Whitbread First Novel Award for "Gerontius," a fiction based on
the mysterious six-week trip made to the Amazon by Sir Edward Elgar
in 1923. This not only showed him to have a rare understanding of
music but may help one in dealing with "Loving Monsters," since he
obviously feels very much at home in that no-man's-land where fact
and fiction overlap. In his present work, the categories are
deliberately, and mischievously, muddled. We can't tell whether what
we're reading is fact or fiction or a mixture of the two, and that's
just the way, by the look of things, that the author planned it.</TE>
<TE>   So, what about Jayjay, the self-proposed subject of James'
biography, who is on his Italian deathbed when we meet him, dropping
names as liberally as a London cockney drops his Hs? He has a signed
photo of Henry Kissinger in his downstairs loo. He gets notes from
Margaret Thatcher about her proctoscopy. He's had the Queen Mum to
stay. But what he's anxious to unload on James and does, at length,
is not this high-flying second half of his life, spent as a favored
hanger-on of court and diplomatic circles, but his
beginnings--Betjemanite memories of sooty, foggy outer London,
followed by teenage escapes to a very different world in prewar
Egypt, where Jayjay plunges into a swirl of voyeurism, pornography,
bisexual experiment, blackmail and top-secret adolescent passions.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, names are seemingly named. August Moll-Ziemcke, the
German desert anthropologist who supplies Jayjay with a promising
line in porno photos, is represented as having actually existed, and
bibliographical details of his book are given. Jayjay is, he says, "a
truthful impostor": no lies, just "versions and the occasional
omission." I'm not so sure. Ambiguities again. On the other hand, the
exotic foreign (and some local) inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria
here are at least as authentic as those of Olivia Manning or Lawrence
Durrell.</TE>
<TE>   The real trouble is that nothing much happens, even when the war
comes. There's no "English Patient" here, and Jayjay's emotional
secret, when it finally emerges, is a damp squib. Never mind. Jayjay
may be in his anecdotage, may have no real story to tell, but his
gossip is racy; you can smell and taste his Cairo back alleys, and he
never for one instant bores you. This, alas, is more than can be said
for James, who keeps bowing out of their interviews to attend to
another life, one that's surprisingly like his author's.</TE>

<HD>Once Upon This Time</HD>
<DH>IN THE FOREST: A Novel, By Edna O'Brien, Houghton Mifflin:
256 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLOTTE INNES</AU>
<BD>Charlotte Innes writes about books for various
publications including the Nation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edna O'Brien's latest novel, "In the Forest," has the atmosphere of a
fairy tale. Not a Disney fairy tale with cute singing dwarfs but the
ancient, scary kind that started out with the death of a mother,
because mothers died often in childbirth in the old days. These
stories featured ogres in dark woods and princesses imprisoned in
impregnable towers to protect their chastity. Terrible things
happened to small children.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, the ogre is Michen O'Kane, a crazed serial killer
whose mother died when he was young. A German resident in the Irish
county where O'Kane has gone on a murderous rampage labels him
"Kinderschreck," or child-frightener, a goblin from German folklore
who sometimes ate children. The princess is the free-spirited,
beautiful Eily Ryan, who has the flaming golden-red hair and "body
white as milk" of princesses down the ages. The child is Maddie, her
son.</LD>
<LD>   Set in contemporary rural Ireland, "In the Forest" is based on a
true story, as are several of O'Brien's recent novels, such as "Down
by the River," a retelling of the "X" case which changed Ireland's
abortion laws, and "House of Splendid Isolation," based on the
real-life story of an Irish Republican Army terrorist. These more
recent books mark a change from her earlier work which had the
London-based writer recalling her Irish girlhood.</LD>
<TE>   "In the Forest" is slightly different from these other retellings
in that it has at its core the old archetypal battle between good and
evil, with one man as a force for primeval chaos, a man so hurt and
twisted that he is beyond salvation. (Some say O'Kane is a horned
devil who has come to punish the world for its sins. He even cuts off
the head of a priest.) Every aspect of this world has both a
benevolent and malevolent example. The harmless fantasy games of
children mirror the vicious actions of an adult out of touch with
reality. Mother-and-son relationships are represented by the
claustrophobic closeness between young O'Kane and his mother and by
the sunny playfulness Eily enjoys with her son.</TE>
<TE>   Eily's decision to live alone with Maddie as a way to keep her
independence is not only complicated by her yearning for love but
also blighted by O'Kane's lust, just as princesses of old were
threatened by lascivious monsters. He calls her "goat girl" (the
animal was an ancient symbol of unbridled carnality). The book opens
with a description of the dark forest (where a horrible crime is
committed) with a rotting dead goat at its center, symbolic of the
loss of its "old innocence."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the book is also thoroughly modern. O'Brien is a superb
storyteller, and "In the Forest" has the pacing of a suspense
thriller, even though we know at the outset what will happen. She
even plays with modern mythology. When O'Kane captures Eily and
Maddie and takes them into the forest, he starts talking like a
crazed cowboy film villain. The story is threaded with modern
sociological and psychological concerns as well. Over and over again,
through his actions, O'Kane revisits his father's abuse and the loss
of his mother, who was depressive and suicidal. He smashes the eggs
in a thrush's nest and flattens the newborn kittens that belong to
the one family that shows him love.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout the work, there are moments when one gets a sense
of unease. One can't help thinking: This troubled young man is not an
archetype for evil. Sure, some people see mental illness that way,
especially when a killer is involved, and O'Brien often makes it
clear that she is relaying a variety of viewpoints, including those
of the police, who want to repay O'Kane's violence with more
violence, and the local people, who think he has unnatural powers.
But at times O'Brien, as the narrator, appears to be presenting that
viewpoint too. As O'Kane starts laughing manically in the police car
soon after he is caught, "a shaft of terror" passes through the
officers, "witnesses to some medieval grotesquerie: his grinning
face, his loathsome eyes with a dead yet murderous glare.</TE>
<TE>   "They are afraid of him now, the Kinderschreck, one of their own
sons come out of their own soil, their own flesh and blood, gone
amok."</TE>
<TE>   No, one wants to say: O'Kane is a human being with a terrible
history. He was molested by priests he trusted, raped in jail. Now he
is suicidal and hears voices. Suddenly, the fairy tale symbolism
feels imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem lies in the fact that the book mirrors almost
exactly a real event, as a blurb notes at the end of the book: the
murder of Imelda Riney, 29, and her 3-year-old son, Liam, who were
shot to death by Brendan O'Donnell in the woods of County Clare in
1994. O'Kane, like O'Donnell, is convicted of murder and sentenced to
life. Like O'Donnell, his insanity defense is rejected and, after
several suicide attempts, he is moved to a mental hospital, where he
dies of a heart attack after a change in his medication. Perhaps if
"In the Forest" were entirely fiction, the reader would feel horror,
but not the kind of outrage that comes from knowing the reality of
the systemic injustice suffered by O'Donnell, which makes the fairy
tale rendering harder to take.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that the tale isn't breathtakingly told in
O'Brien's typically graceful, emotionally gripping style that stays
just this side of melodrama. It is a story rooted in real feelings
and truthful description, like that of O'Kane's round tin box that
once held floor polish, now filled with "bullets, brass-coated, their
snouts close together" which Maddie pores over, fascinated, as any
boy would be--even though O'Kane is about to kill him. Despite the
fairy tale framework that butts up against the reality of O'Kane's
troubled life, "In the Forest" can't help but lure the spellbound
reader onward from one gritty or dream-laden scene to the next.</TE>

<DH>THE IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE: Movies, Comics, Theatre and Other
Aspects of Popular Culture, By Robert Warshow, Harvard University
Press: 302 pp., $18.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT</AU>
<BD>Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, a former daily book reviewer
for The New York Times, is completing his second novel, "The Mad Cook
of Pymatuning."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, pop-cultural artifacts--from video games to reality
television shows to novels in the form of comic books--come at us
like a meteor shower as viewed in a fun-house mirror. Trying to
assess their significance to our culture is like being inside one of
those elevators in space that science writers invoke to explain time
and motion in Einstein's theory of relativity. We look out of our
elevator and ask: Is pop entertainment approaching the theoretical
limits of violence? Is meaning growing more absurd, or does it just
seem that way because we ourselves are moving backward? And we make
ourselves dizzy trying to find answers.</LD>
<LD>   In such an atmosphere, it is a relief to experience the absolute
gravity of Robert Warshow, the author of "The Immediate Experience:
Movies, Comics, Theatre and Other Aspects of Popular Culture." Nearly
half a century ago, in October 1954, Warshow, a young magazine editor
whose thoughtful essays on popular culture had been exciting the
readers of Partisan Review, Commentary (where he worked) and other
intellectual journals, applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a
book about film.</LD>
<TE>   In his articulate and gracefully written project description,
Warshow argued that serious film criticism tended to fall into two
general types: aesthetic criticism, which stressed matters of
technique, and sociological criticism, which judged the effect of the
film on its audience. What Warshow proposed to do was to accept
movies as being "the most highly developed and most engrossing of the
popular arts" and to judge them in terms of their connection to the
viewer. As he put it: "A man watches a movie, and the critic must
acknowledge that he is that man."</TE>
<TE>   Warshow died the following year of a heart attack at the age of 37
and so never got to write his book. But he left behind enough essays
to form a book published in 1962, the original version of "The
Immediate Experience," with an introduction by critic Lionel
Trilling, and with Warshow's Guggenheim application serving as its
preface. In and out of print over the decades and highly prized by
serious students of film, the book has been brought out in a new
edition, with the addition of eight previously unpublished pieces by
Warshow, a biographical essay by film critic David Denby and an
epilogue by philosopher-turned-film critic Stanley Cavell.</TE>
<TE>   Warshow covers an odd assortment of subjects in the volume, from
the comic strip "Krazy Kat" ("a very sweet-tempered fantasy"), to the
plays of Clifford Odets ("... the spectacular achievement which makes
him a dramatist of importance is his truthful description of the New
York Jews of the lower middle class."), to E. B. White and the New
Yorker magazine ("The New Yorker has always dealt with experience not
by trying to understand it but by prescribing the attitude to be
adopted toward it").</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, his 12 film essays are placed in the latter two-thirds
of the book. They don't examine most of the American movies you think
of first when you recall the best ones of the late 1940s and early
1950s, like "On the Waterfront" or "It's a Wonderful Life" or "From
Here to Eternity" or "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." And where he
does take up a particular film, like William Wyler's "The Best Years
of Our Lives" or Elia Kazan's "Boomerang!" or Leo McCarey's "My Son
John," he refuses to summarize their plots, as if we had them fresh
in our minds from just last night.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't for his assessment of familiar works that you read
Warshow. Rather it's to judge him on his own terms--to look at the
man who is reacting to the work and to see what that work is doing to
him. After a careful reading of "The Immediate Experience," a clear
image of that man remains somewhat elusive.</TE>
<TE>   He's most visibly present in the volume's best piece, "Paul, the
Horror Comics, and Dr. Wertham," about his son's casual attachment to
comic books, like Mad and Tales From the Crypt, and Dr. Fredric
Wertham's famous crusade to have the publication of horror comics
banned. Here Warshow shows us all the colors of his lovingly
respectful relationship with his son, his wish that Paul would not be
so attracted to such violent entertainment along with his concession
that it probably isn't doing him serious harm, and his judgment of
Wertham's analysis in his book "Seduction of the Innocent."</TE>
<TE>   With devastating effectiveness, he concludes that "Dr. Wertham's
world, like the world of comic books, is one where the logic of
personal interest is inexorable, and 'Seduction of the Innocent' is a
kind of crime comic book for parents, as its lurid title alone would
lead one to suspect."</TE>
<TE>   Less available to our scrutiny is Warshow the anti-Stalinist. His
despair over Soviet communism is extreme and serves him well as a
tool of analysis in judging works such as Trilling's novel "The
Middle of the Journey," Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible," the
letters of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and five of the famous movies
on the Russian Revolution: Pudovkin's "The End of St. Petersburg,"
Dovzhenko's "Earth," Eisenstein's "Potemkin," "Ten Days That Shook
the World" and "The General Line," as well as "Tsar to Lenin," a
collection of authentic pictures of actual people and events made by
perhaps 100 photographers. (About these films, he writes that so
weary is he with the joke of human aspiration and wickedness they
depict, he "would have given up all ironies, and the sense of tragedy
and the sense of history along with them, just to have stupid,
handsome Nicholas grinding his heel once more in the face of unhappy
Russia." Oh, for a return to basic indignation! he is saying.)</TE>
<TE>   In his essay on "The Crucible" (currently enjoying a successful
revival on Broadway), Warshow argues that the Salem witch trials were
not in fact an act of persecution; they were the result of "a
metaphysical error," the judgment that certain people were damned.
"The Salem trials were not political," he writes, "and had nothing
whatever to do with civil rights, unless it is a violation to hang a
murderer," which is what witches were judged to be. By alluding to
them in his play and altering their historical meaning, he argues,
Miller manages to seem to be saying something about McCarthyism
without really saying anything.</TE>
<TE>   Warshow writes: "Seeing all this on stage, we are free to reflect
that something very like these trials has been going on in recent
years [the early 1950s] in the United States. How much like? Mr.
Miller does not say. But very like, allowing of course for some
superficial differences: No one has been pressed to death in recent
years, for instance. Still, people have lost their jobs for refusing
to say under oath whether or not they are communists. The essential
pattern is the same, isn't it? And when we speak of 'universal
significance,' we mean sticking to the essential pattern, don't we?
Mr. Miller is under no obligation to tell us whether he thinks the
trial of Alger Hiss was a 'witch trial'; he is writing about the
Salem trials."</TE>
<TE>   The explanation for such disingenuousness, Warshow argues
elsewhere, in "The Legacy of the '30s," lies in our loss of a sense
of reality. "The most important effect of the intellectual life of
the '30s and the culture that grew out of it has been to distort and
eventually to destroy the emotional and moral content of experience,
putting in its place a system of conventionalized 'responses,'" like
applauding Arthur Miller for "speak[ing] out." He continues, "In
fact, the chief function of mass culture is to relieve one of the
necessity of experiencing one's life directly." One might say that
his mission in these essays is to get back in touch with real
experience.</TE>
<TE>   But what does he believe lies beyond the stultifying conflict over
communism? Here he is less incisive. His dismantling of "The Best
Years of Our Lives" is based on the shallowness of its message that
the solution to facing postwar life is to embrace "simple" and
"American" virtues. His analysis of the gangster "as tragic hero" is
based in part on what he sees as the criminal's willingness to say
"no" to American optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Such analyses are arresting enough, just as his explanation of
Charlie Chaplin's development as depending on the shifting balance
between the individual and society is brilliant. But what, we have to
ask, is his judgment of the deeper forces in American life, the ones
that lie beyond the conflict between the right and the left? All he
seems to have to say on this subject is that "the real causes" of
what happened in the '30s "lay far back in the history of American
culture and the social and psychological effects of industrial
capitalism." This portentous summing up scarcely connects us to the
man watching the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Warshow was to some extent a victim of the cultural
conflict he describes. He writes: "Even to stand out against this
culture uncompromisingly--a thing very few were able to do; much more
was required than just to be an anti-Stalinist--was only a partial
victory. One kept one's integrity, but this integrity became a purely
personal satisfaction, without real weight--and the one assumption
everyone shared was that weight was important. The culture remained
and spread and entrenched itself, and its mere existence--this
climate in which one had to live--was a standing threat to one's
personality, was in a sense a deep personal humiliation."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he was only half freed and would have accomplished the
rest of his liberation by writing the book he proposed. Short of
that, the essays in "The Immediate Experience" remain a beacon, a
light to begin to show the way to how we might escape our present
cultural confusions.</TE>

<LD>CRUSTACEANS</LD>
<LD>   By Andrew Cowan</LD>
<LD>   Picador: 240 pp., $22</LD>
<TE>   Midwinter, and the narrator of this novel, Paul, 30-something, is
driving to a seaside village somewhere in Britain. Why? Don't know.
He thinks aloud as if he were speaking to someone, but to whom? We
sense another presence in the car. We think it is a child and, after
20 pages or so, we are pretty certain the child has died. But we
don't ask. We are polite. Get on with it, man! Who died? Was it your
fault? Paul won't say. He thinks about his mother, who died when she
was 25 and he was 10. Then the "you" he talks to gets more specific.
The "you" is a little boy, named Euan, who died when he was nearly 6.
Ominous pronoun, you. So unspecific and yet so very intimate and
specific to the narrator. When we die, do we become pronouns in
literature's graveyard?</TE>
<TE>   And so Andrew Cowan's "Crustaceans" hurtles toward death,
gathering facts as it plows through the narrator's memories of his
mother and of his lover, Euan's mother, Ruth, and of his mighty
father, a sculptor. This death becomes a juggernaut in our
imaginations: gathering momentum, making us read further because we
want to know how and why. In fiction, death is often a denouement on
the page, like Virginia Woolf's famous parentheses around Mrs.
Ramsey's death: a mere mention or phrase. Not in this novel, which
works exactly backward from real life, unzipping itself to Euan's
death. In the end, it is too intimate a novel. Life after Euan's
death is more relevant to us, and there is none of that here. We will
not know Paul and Ruth as they hobble through life after the death of
their son. We did not know Euan. He was Paul's "you."</TE>

<TE>   HE SECRET LIFE OF BEES</TE>
<TE>   By Sue Monk Kidd</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 302 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Life of Bees" begins with a death and proceeds down
the road through the lives of the people left behind. "It is the
peculiar nature of the world to go on spinning no matter what sort of
heartbreak is happening," thinks the brave young girl at the heart of
this novel, whose mother died when she was 4, leaving her with the
meanest cuss of a father in South Carolina. So mean that he tells his
4-year-old daughter, who had been caught in the middle of a shoving
match with a gun between the two parents, that she was the one who
pushed the gun and set it off, killing her own mother. This is only a
convenient story for the police and only the tip of the iceberg of T.
Ray's meanness. Sue Monk Kidd's novel is a study of meanness, a still
life in which each fruit represents a different variety: bullies,
racists, police, drunks, crazy people, petty people and tattletales.
Lily Melissa Owens runs through this story holding her mother's pure
love. She frees her baby-sitter, a black maid who has been abused by
several white men and put in prison for it, and the two of them
follow Lily's instincts to safety. They tend bees in a house in
another town where Lily's mother once found sanctuary, and that's all
I can say about it. "The Secret Life" is one of those novels that
leaves a reader more confident: Heck, if this kid could do it, so can
I.</TE>

<TE>   Essays and Stories About Urban Nature</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Terrell F. Dixon</TE>
<TE>   Georgia University Press:</TE>
<TE>   312 pp., $19.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Phrases such as "relationship to place" leave us all cold, as if
we're standing on an already defeated planet remembering what the
wind smelled like. Some of these essays wander down that dead end,
but most don't. The best describe something new you might not have
noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Take Chet Raymo's essay about silence: "It is a thin membrane that
separates us from chaos. The child sent flying by the skateboarder
bounced in slow motion and lay still. There was a long pause. Pigeons
froze against the gray sky.... The mother's cry was lost in the space
between the stars." Or William Goyen's essay describing the people of
New York's Third Avenue as a kind of gypsy tribe that still had the
spirit of the El train going through them: "These Third Avenue people
had the same vagabond, noisy air and quality that the ramshackle
train and platform symbolized. The El had created a genus of
humanity, almost as the plow had shaped his own." That is sterling
writing. And so is David Wong Louie's story "Bottles Beaujolais," set
in New York among people who think they can control nature, with its
fantastic riff on wines: "'To me you are a burgundy,' I said. Each
syllable echoed in my ears long after it had left my lips....
'There's nothing remotely sauterne about you. You're not even
blond.'" All the senses are alive in the best of these essays and
stories. The writing proves the old theory that our finest metaphors
come from nature, no matter where we find it.</TE>

<DH>BROWN: The Last Discovery of America, By Richard Rodriguez,
Viking: 234 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez is a senior fellow at the New America
Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his 1901 autobiography, Booker T. Washington recounts an incident
he witnessed on a train that illustrates just how "difficult it
sometimes is to know where the black begins and the white ends."</LD>
<LD>   He describes a conductor inspecting a light-skinned passenger
seated in the "colored" compartment. The official examines the man's
eyes, nose and hands. If the rider is Negro, he doesn't want to send
him into the white coach. If he is white, he doesn't want to insult
him by asking his race. To solve his quandary the conductor bends
over to glance at the man's feet. At last he is convinced that the
passenger is properly seated among his own kind.</LD>
<LD>   Washington himself was racially mixed, the son of a black slave
and a free white man. There were reports that his father lived on a
nearby plantation. But his identity and the circumstances of his
involvement with Washington's mother were unclear. Like Frederick
Douglass before him, who heard it whispered that his master was his
father, Washington's family history was only a rumor.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Rodriguez's beautiful new book, "Brown," is a meditation
on America's family secrets. It is a lyrical hymn on the tenebrous
side of history, one not marked by triumphs or defeats but by
entanglements born of eroticism and, sometimes, love. It is at once a
homily on the dangers of puritanism in an impure world and the
confession of an aging baby boomer who has given up trying to
reconcile the contradictory elements of his American soul.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez calls this long-awaited collection of essays the third
of a trilogy on "American public life and my private life." Though
"Hunger of Memory" (1982) and "Days of Obligation" (1992) were,
respectively, about class and ethnicity, "Brown" presumes to be about
race. But race is only the book's point of departure. Rodriguez's
meditation on the meanings of brown--a color whose essential beauty
and mystery, he says, derive from the fact that it is a mixture of
other colors--is also an exploration of American culture in an era of
trampled borders.</TE>
<TE>   If "Hunger of Memory" was priggish and ungenerous in its vision of
assimilation, "Days of Obligation" was Rodriguez's reconciliation
with his ethnicity. This third installment, however, is more daring,
far-reaching and more resolutely unresolved than its antecedents. In
"Brown," Rodriguez regards the nation at large with his California
mestizo eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Having destroyed the notion that brown is monochrome, he
challenges the shibboleth of white and black purity. If brown is the
byproduct of collisions--wanted and unwanted--between strangers, then
we Americans are all brown by definition. "Brown" is a paean to
impurity.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the ideal of the United States as a crucible forging
Old World identities into new Americans has been something of a civic
religion since the early 20th century. But it has always been
woefully incomplete. For one thing, the national ideology was never
extended to blacks and other nonwhites. Even Israel Zangwill, whose
1908 play "The Melting Pot" popularized the eponymous ideal, wrote
that whites were justified in avoiding intermarriage with blacks. He
would only recognize that "spiritual miscegenation" between black and
white had enriched American culture.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to criticism from sectarian Jews of the era, Zangwill,
whose drama featured a Russian-Jewish immigrant who rejected his
faith's prohibition of intermarriage, also retreated from his ideal
of the biological mixing of ethnic whites in America. In an essay
published in 1914, he conceded that "the Jew may be Americanized and
the American Judaised without any gamic interaction."</TE>
<TE>   In "Brown," Rodriguez speaks of all types of intermingling,
"gamic" and otherwise. He extends his gratitude to American blacks
for remaking the English language, giving it so much of its cadence
and dynamism, and then sharing it with the children of immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout these essays, Rodriguez expands our vision of our
shared lineage and recasts the traditional American narratives. He
upends the notion of U.S. history as one that runs from East to West.
America, he says, is destined to be the intersection of North and
South. He asks us to consider a history in which whites are not both
the subject and the verb, one in which "minorities" are not merely
direct objects.</TE>
<TE>   Challenging Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that Europeans
became Americans by battling the wilderness, Rodriguez argues that it
was the struggle (and romance) with the Indians that first
distinguished United States culture from the Old World. He muses over
whites' debt to Indians for their early lessons in survival and their
perennial fascination with "going native." The Boston Tea Party. The
Improved Order of Red Men. The impersonation of the Indian long has
given American children "the license to wildness." It is no wonder,
he concludes, that "Europeans began to regard all Americans as
savage."</TE>
<TE>   Once having established our mestizo past, Rodriguez turns his
attention to the Hispanic tones of our future. Half a century ago,
"brown was like the skinny or fat kids left over after the team
captains chose sides." There was no room for brown in a black and
white world. Today, brown threatens to recalibrate America's sense of
self. The encroachment of Latin America, which for all its cultural
hang-ups still acknowledges its mixed racial origins, could give the
United States a more "playful notion of race."</TE>
<TE>   For American blacks, Rodriguez wishes the freedom "to admit
brown," "to speak freely of ancestors, of Indian and Scots and German
and plantation owner." He is skeptical of arguments that American
Hispanics will create a Spanish-speaking version of Quebec. Though
Pat Buchanan heralds the end of American civilization, this
self-described "queer Catholic Indian Spaniard" is confident of both
the "omnivorous" nature of the English language and the adaptive
strength of Hispanicity. "Try as we will to be culturally aggrieved
by day, we find the gringos kind of attractive in the moonlight."</TE>
<TE>   But the Mexicans who daily stomp on "the legal fiction that
America controls its own destiny" also begin to shade United States
culture with deeper, more visceral shades of brown. "Mexico is a
brown idea we would rather not discuss," he writes. To Rodriguez,
brown means fecundity and inevitability. It is the color of
complexity and of illicit passion. It smells of shame and sin.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its impure past, America still adheres to the fiction of
its purity and innocence. While no contemporary writer has
rhapsodized on the American cult of possibility more eloquently than
Rodriguez, here he laments our growing fearfulness. Though always
infused with the foreboding of his Irish Catholicism, Rodriguez's
writing is more preoccupied than ever with finitude. Brown is also
the color of aging.</TE>
<TE>   But his middle age--he turns 58 this year--and thoughts of
mortality have not turned Rodriguez away from the world. Indeed,
"Brown" is an embrace of life and all its complications. He is
concerned that as borders--be they ethnic, religious, aesthetic or
sexual--fall all around us, Americans are too busy erecting new walls
behind which to hide. "We feel surrounded, that's the thing."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that as the South fuses with the North, it will rescue
America from its fear of nature, from its loneliness, from its
"desire for cleansing." The South is the "netherworld of biology,
sex, hair, infection, blackened skin, multiplicity." Rodriguez's
confessional trilogy is Augustine in reverse. In "Late Victorians,"
perhaps the finest essay in "Days of Obligation," he weighs the price
of his own equanimity, his secret to survival as a gay man in the age
of AIDS. In "Brown," while still acknowledging his temperate
character, he has at last learned to love the corruptible flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he yearns for the South in the way that only a Northerner
can. His longing is reminiscent of Rilke's attraction to the sensuous
European South or the scores of Northern Protestant painters who have
flocked to portray the warm hues of the Mediterranean.</TE>
<TE>   In "Hunger of Memory," Rodriguez writes of having "a conventional
sex life" during his undergraduate years. Separately, he discusses
his penchant for secrecy. In "Brown," he explains how the combination
of his sexuality and his secrecy helped forge his extraordinary
vision. When asked to measure the influence of his homosexuality on
his writing, Rodriguez invokes the memory of another great celebrator
of American multiplicity. "[Walt] Whitman's advantage was
that--prohibited from admitting the specific--he learned to speak of
the many."</TE>
<TE>   But in "Brown," Rodriguez writes of both the specific and the
many. ("Sodomy is among the brownest of thoughts.") Near the end of
these rich, wide-ranging essays, he broods over his own "brown
paradox": the tension between his Catholicism and his homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Rodriguez's own sense of self has grown broad
enough to accommodate--but not to resolve--his own contradictions.
This is precisely what he wishes for America. But before we can
embrace the many sides of our collective lives, we must cultivate a
stronger faith in life itself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Brown'</TE>
<TE>   Brown as impurity.</TE>
<TE>   I write of a color that is not a singular color, not a strict
recipe, not an expected result, but a color produced by careless
desire, even by accident; by two or several. I write of blood that is
blended. I write of brown as complete freedom of substance and
narrative. I extol impurity.</TE>
<TE>   I eulogize a literature that is suffused with brown, with
allusion, irony, paradox--ha!--pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   I write about race in America in hopes of undermining the notion
of race in America.</TE>
<TE>   Brown bleeds through the straight line, unstaunchable--the line
separating black from white, for example. Brown confuses. Brown forms
at the border of contradiction (the ability of language to express
two or several things at once, the ability of bodies to experience
two or several things at once).</TE>

<DH>THE SECRET ARTIST: A Close Reading of Sigmund Freud, By
Lesley Chamberlain, Seven Stories Press: 352 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL S. ROTH</AU>
<BD>Michael S. Roth was curator of the exhibition "Sigmund
Freud: Conflict and Culture" at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los
Angeles and is president of the California College of Arts and Crafts
in Oakland and San Francisco.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is an old man we go to see when we are feeling bad or just
confused. He doesn't say much. He sits behind us when we lie down on
the couch. We can hear him breathing, and we smell his cigar. He
makes us talk, if only because he refuses to say much. We know what
he wants. Not just any old stories will do. He wants to hear about
our secrets, our longings. We can start talking about the latest
disappointments, the most recent crises. But we know that's not
enough. He wants to hear about things we won't tell anybody else. He
is there, waiting for us to open up some cave in ourselves and wake
up that hibernating animal. That's the story he wants, isn't it?
That's the story we want to tell him.</LD>
<TE>   Sigmund Freud won't go away. Everybody knows he was wrong, don't
they? Medication is so much more effective, and then there is all
that embarrassing stuff about sex and penises, about inescapable
aggression and guilt. All of it is from another time, isn't it? Yet
Freud won't go away. He keeps popping up in places where he has no
business. Just when we succeed in pushing him out of medicine because
we really have no evidence that his practice works, he appears in
university humanities programs, novels, television. And when it seems
that we can dismiss him (with a laugh) from overly theoretical work
by our jargon-laden literary scholars, there are nostalgic noises
from psychiatry complaining about meds, insurance-driven
mental-health treatment and the need for patients to make meaning.
There he sits, behind us.</TE>
<TE>   Lesley Chamberlain, journalist and author of "Nietzsche in Turin,"
has written a book about Freud, "The Secret Artist," which links
biography with a thematic reading of his major works. There are more
than 1,700 entries in the University of California Library catalog
under the subject "Sigmund Freud." Chamberlain pays brief attention
to some of the more recent entries in the debates about
psychoanalysis, but she is more inclined to close her eyes and try to
imagine what Freud is really doing there, sitting behind us.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain wants to account for Freud's hold on us and on her,
and so she picks and chooses bits of his biography and writings to
create a picture of the old man. She imagines that the man behind her
is an artist afraid to reveal himself as such because of the
legitimacy of scientific discourse and because of his own fear of
losing his narrative grip on the irrational. Chamberlain emphasizes
both Freud's productive fascination with the irrational (that's what
makes him an artist) and his need to master the irrational in
publicly respectable ways (that's what makes him want to keep his
artistry hidden behind the language of science).</TE>
<TE>   Why does Chamberlain claim that the old man was an artist? First,
she cites the elaborate interpretive writings, "based on imaginative
sympathy with the human condition, together with a capacity to create
character on the page, and generate action." She also dubs Freud the
father of the creative writing class and imagines that his
psychoanalytic writings could be redescribed as a long poem about
nature and three novels: "Vienna 1900," "Love Story" and "Look What I
Can Do!" Does Chamberlain regret that Freud didn't step out from
behind her couch and recite his poem, declaim his fictions? I think
not. Instead, she prefers to imagine her Freud as a writer conflicted
about his own status as a writer.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain emphasizes that Freud's theoretical texts are infused
with the energy and artistry born of personal conflict and
professional ambition. She notes that the founder of psychoanalysis
"gives us ... a theory of intensity, coupled with a theory of
meaning." By intensity she means what Freud usually calls trieb
(drive or instinct, famously located in the id) and what we usually
hear as sex or possibly aggression. Managing this intensity without
losing its capacity to generate significance in our lives is at the
core of what Freud sometimes spoke of as ego, id and superego
dynamics. (Speaking that way was his attempt to not appear to be
merely an artist.)</TE>
<TE>   The founder of psychoanalysis, she says, turned from the study of
the individual mind to the common good because he really wanted to
address the simple but fundamental question: "Why can't there be more
real and fulfilled love?"</TE>
<TE>   The strength of this book is that the author sees this question
hovering behind the couch. Freud said that there can't be more
satisfaction, let alone happiness, in the world because we make
ourselves miserable and because we have created a society that is
very good at making us even more miserable. Fleeing our own
capacities for pleasure (including the pleasure of violence) we
unconsciously turn powerful aggression against ourselves. Thus guilt
shadows pleasure at every turn, both because of our desire for
prohibitions and because of the contradictory nature of our desires.
Recognizing the ways that we contribute to our own misery may itself
be a pleasure (one of the reasons we keep coming back to the old man,
I suppose), and it also gives us some possibility of changing the
cycle of our self-punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Self-inflicted misery hasn't gone away, even as we try to protect
ourselves against harm from others. That's why the issues Freud
explored have remained vital for us even as his findings and
methodology have come under increasing critical pressure. Our notions
of identity, memory, childhood, sexuality, aggression and, most
notably, of meaning have been shaped in relation to--and often in
opposition to--Freud's work. Though hotly contested, Freudian
thinking informs the ways we perceive ourselves and our society, and
it remains relevant to how some of our most pressing concerns (from
drug abuse and aggression to gender and sexuality) are addressed. For
no matter how critical we are of the old man's influence on our
culture, there seems to be no good way of making him disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain wants to keep him around by reminding us that he was
really an artist at heart and that he should not be judged by merely
scientific standards. This is less an argument than an evasion.
Nobody who thinks of the old man primarily as a scientist will be
persuaded by Chamberlain's reading of the key texts. She is preaching
to the choir when she says that Freud was really a writer, an artist.
Of course one can read him this way, and, even though I sing in that
church myself, I am unconvinced that he tried to keep this side of
his contribution a secret, as Chamberlain claims. He just saw it as
one aspect of his work.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain's old man may not then have been a secret artist
because of his infatuation with science, but we can see that he was
an artist of secrets because he was most concerned with making
meaning out of memory, with constructing histories with which we
could live. Of course, it is entirely possible that constructing a
meaningful account of how we have come to be who we are will not
always seem important to a culture increasingly bent on "coaching"
its way into a successful future. In that case, the cigar smoke and
the stories would no longer hang in the air. But if we continue to
consider the past important for giving meaning and direction to our
lives, it's a good bet we will find ourselves going back to the old
man to tell our tales and construct our histories.</TE>

<BD>Hazel Rowley is the author of "Christina Stead: A
Biography" and, most recently, "Richard Wright: The Life and Times."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The value placed on the color of the skin is always and everywhere
and forever a delusion," James Baldwin said in 1976. And yet, as four
recent books on race make clear, this country is obsessed with race
and skin color.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Pratt Guterl's "The Color of Race in America, 1900-1940"
shows the utter arbitrariness of racial categories. Even the label
"white" has changed its meaning over time. In the years leading up to
World War I, the steerage sections of ships to New York were packed
with immigrants--Irish, Eastern European Jews and southern Europeans.
They were not Anglo-Saxons and, therefore, according to the racial
taxonomy of the time, they were not "white." Northerners worried a
great deal about these aliens and their effect on Nordic American
stock. They gave little thought to African Americans: They were a
Southern problem.</LD>
<LD>   During World War I, European immigration stopped. African
Americans were encouraged to move north to fill the employment gap.
From 1916 to 1928, during the Great Migration, 12 million black
Southerners made their way to Northern industrial cities. Northern
phobias changed. In 1920, everyone was reading Lothrop Stoddard's
racist book, "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World
Supremacy."</LD>
<TE>   That was the year the United States Census Bureau dropped the
"mulatto" category. Americans with the slightest drop of African
blood, whatever their color, were called "black." As part of the same
process, people of Irish, Jewish and Mediterranean heritage became
"white."</TE>
<TE>   Progressives like W.E.B. Du Bois were hopeful that the Great
Migration would eventually bring about a genuine melting pot. He
foresaw a time when blacks would disappear into the mass of Americans
in the same way the Irish and Scandinavians and Italians had done, a
time when the word "race" would no longer be useful. He was to be
bitterly disillusioned. During the late 1920s, Northern cities became
increasingly segregated. Race riots flared up. Du Bois came to the
conclusion that white supremacy was built into the psyche of white
people. He and his wife migrated to Ghana.</TE>
<TE>   "Better Day Coming," Adam Fairclough's survey of the struggle for
civil rights, echoes the spiritual hymn "Dere's a better day com',
Don't you get weary." However, it's hard to be optimistic in the face
of 11/2 centuries in which whites have constantly subverted black
progress. As Fairclough writes: "Blacks usually took one step forward
only to find themselves two steps back." His book makes poignant
reading.</TE>
<TE>   A professor of American history at the University of East Anglia
in England, Fairclough argues that, though militant confrontation
appears more courageous and heroic, some important gains have come
from strategies which appear to be compromises, like Booker T.
Washington's stance as an accommodationist. In the 1880s, Washington
established Tuskegee Institute in Alabama in the face of deep-seated
opposition to black education from Southern whites. Washington's
critics--most famously Du Bois--always condemned Tuskegee's
"industrial education," with its manual labor orientation, as a
training in inferiority. Fairclough sees Washington's project as more
subversive. According to him, while Southern whites saw "industrial
education" as a way of keeping blacks down, Washington quietly used
it to raise them up.</TE>
<TE>   In the black community, Washington is generally regarded as the
paradigmatic black sellout. Former President Clinton, on the other
hand, has been systematically championed. And Fairclough is much
tougher on Clinton than he is on Washington. As Fairclough sees it,
Clinton has betrayed blacks. Promising to "end welfare as we know
it," he signed a bill that ended aid to families with dependent
children, turned welfare over to the states and severed people from
the welfare rolls after two years. He supported the "three-strikes"
laws, which hugely increased America's disproportionately black
prison population.</TE>
<TE>   Fairclough does not say much about the vast gulf between the black
middle class and the black underclass, but he does point out that the
"black community" is no longer a single entity and that, because of
this, black leaders are no longer clear about how best to mobilize
against racism. "More than thirty years after the death of Martin
Luther King, the next road--the right road--is hard to discern."</TE>
<TE>   And for Bob Blauner, this sentiment is equally true. Blauner, a
retired UC Berkeley sociologist, is dismayed that essays he wrote to
explain American racial oppression in the late 1960s in "Racial
Oppression in America" are considered just as relevant today. Racism
in this country, he writes, is like "a gritty old boxer who just
won't stay down." His "Still the Big News" is a revised and expanded
edition of that earlier book.</TE>
<TE>   Why does racism persist? According to Blauner, the founders of
modern sociology--Marx, Weber, Durkheim--all predicted that racial
and ethnic allegiances would disappear as traditional societies gave
way to modern industrial societies. Twentieth century American
sociologists were convinced that modern social stratification would
be based on class, not race. They were wrong. Blauner's conclusion is
that racial oppression is an indispensable element of American
society. If the majority of the population benefits from white
supremacy, why would this majority care about the moral issues?</TE>
<TE>   Blauner's vocabulary on race has changed since the late 1960s, and
several of his formerly contentious arguments (such as the claim that
there is a distinct Afro-American culture) have become widely
accepted today. The academy itself has clearly changed. (In the '60s,
Blauner, painfully conscious of the exploitative nature of his role
as a white scholar working on black subject matter, did his best to
incorporate social action into his academic research.) What has not
changed much is the reality of racism in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In "The World Is a Ghetto," Howard Winant steps beyond our
national borders. An anti-racist activist since the 1960s, Winant
sounds an urgent alarm. In his view, the worldwide struggle against
racism has become stymied by the deluded notion that we are "beyond
race," that the world is now truly multicultural and that our
policies should therefore be colorblind.</TE>
<TE>   Winant's basic argument (presented, unfortunately, in prose stiff
with jargon) is that race has been a central ingredient in the
development of the modern world. Concepts of "empire" and "nation,"
"capital and labor" and "culture and identity" all had racial
dimensions. The transition to modernity, through slavery and
colonialism, involved a worldwide racial division into Europeans
("us," the masters, the "true Christians") and the rest of the world
(the "others," the "uncivilized," the non-Christians).</TE>
<TE>   World War II, which "left a legacy of revulsion at racism and
genocide," ruptured the old racial order. In the 1950s and '60s,
independence struggles and social movements gradually brought about
decolonization and civil rights legislation in the U.S. International
protest finally resulted in the end of apartheid in South Africa. In
the last half a century, because of vast immigration of nonwhite
laborers, Europe has become racially heterogeneous.</TE>
<TE>   But do these changes mean, as Du Bois and others once envisioned,
that we are at last "beyond race"? Can we sit back and celebrate
"diversity"? No, says Winant. We cannot transcend racism by fudging
reality. Nowhere have the gains of the last 50 years resulted in
large-scale redistribution of resources. It is not a viable
proposition to have "democracy for some." Rather, it is "a recipe for
thorough-going social and political conflict, and often for open
warfare."</TE>
<TE>   To move beyond these grim realities, Winant insists, we must first
reject the division of the world into "the West and the rest." Then
we must take the next step. "The West attained its prosperity and
invented its democracy at the expense of those whom it exploited and
excluded. The West therefore owes a substantial debt to the world's
'others.'" This reminds me of something else Baldwin said: "The world
is not the world Americans think it is. For example, the world is not
white.... The structure that held the Western world together is
crumbling. All that's left now is naked power."</TE>

<DH>REGARDING FILM: Criticism and Comment, By Stanley
Kauffmann, Performing Arts Journal Books:  216 pp., $21.95 CITIZEN
SARRIS: American Film Critic, Edited by Emanuel Levy, Scarecrow
Press: 312 pp., $45</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN SIMON</AU>
<BD>John Simon is the theater critic for New York magazine
and music critic for The New Leader. His most recent book is
"Dreamers of Dreams: Essays on Poets and Poetry."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1960s and early 1970s were heady times for film criticism. In
colleges and universities, in cafes, bars, movie theater lobbies and
surrounding sidewalks, movies were the subject of heated debates.
Neither moviegoing nor movie reviewing was new, but youthful
hordes--uncomfortable with literature and not yet enslaved by
television--found something to get excited about in the movies. More
than ever before and perhaps ever since, they looked to critics to
stimulate, shape or confirm their opinions, and they gravitated
toward the critics who best satisfied their bents.</LD>
<LD>   Though precise terminology is elusive, there were at the time two
kinds of critics: the eggheads, who preferred what were loosely
called art films, and the populists, who grooved on Hollywood movies
and their foreign counterparts. The eggheads were Stanley Kauffmann,
Dwight Macdonald, Vernon Young, Charles Thomas Samuels and I, with
relatively few adherents. The populists were Andrew Sarris, Pauline
Kael and Manny Farber, with their legions of followers.</LD>
<LD>   From today's vantage, the terms "egghead" and "populist" are
hardly sufficient. Macdonald and his like were engaged with movies
but were interested in other critical fields as well. They valued
film no higher or lower than the other arts, while the populists,
mostly younger men and women, were nurtured exclusively on film. It
was an intoxicant.</LD>
<TE>   Enhanced with popcorn and awash in Cokes, nerds and wallflowers
could fantasize that the glamorous stars were making love to them.
Eventually college film courses and film societies enabled the young
to get academic credit and easy dates from among the like-minded. And
it did not take long for die-hard movie fans to upgrade themselves to
buffs and eventually to cineastes or cinephiles. To establish true
superiority, they spurned most mainstream movies, which everyone had
seen; instead, they exalted the obscure, the ragged, the
lowest-budget genre movies.</TE>
<TE>   While Kauffmann, Macdonald and the rest of them struggled to
separate the chaff from the wheat, the buffs chewed on the chaff as
if it were spearmint gum. And there were critics to encourage them:
Good souls like James Agee, Robert Warshow and Otis Ferguson who,
feeling ashamed that the domestic product fell short of the imports,
valiantly ferreted out the few diamonds in the rough.</TE>
<TE>   Sarris was a young American film buff doing research at the
celebrated Cinematheque Francaise in Paris in the early 1960s. At the
time, Francois Truffaut, a young critic for the journal Cahiers du
Cinema, was advancing what he called the "politique des auteurs":
positing the supremacy of the director, downgrading some reputations
and extolling the techniques of certain Hollywood filmmakers for
their real or putative strengths. Sarris immediately saw the
potential of transplanting what was to be called auteurism to
America. Meanwhile populist criticism had another rising
non-auteurist star: Pauline Kael, who started writing in 1953 and
whose basic philosophy was that movies were like sex--some good, some
bad--and that what mattered was what turned her on. She and Sarris
became the sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly co-leaders of
populist criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The editor of "Citizen Sarris," Emanuel Levy, observes in passing
that "Kauffmann and Simon wrote for smaller magazines" and were,
partly for that reason, less influential. This is an important point.
Because Kael ended up writing for the New Yorker, the most
prestigious mainstream magazine, and Sarris for the Village Voice,
the then-leading countercultural organ, both had bully pulpits.</TE>
<TE>   Be that as it may, the clash of the two film-criticism movements
stirred up the 1960s film community. As the critic Molly Haskell
explains in "Citizen Sarris": "There was something wonderfully
outrageous in the controversies of the sixties, with Andrew and
Pauline and John Simon and Dwight MacDonald [sic] going toe to toe in
passionate and personal debate, frothing at the mouth, sparks flying,
diatribes flowing, at parties and in the pages of outlets both
respectable and obscure."</TE>
<TE>   But those days are gone. Kael's famous attack on Sarris and
auteurism, and his reply, would not resonate today. Few publications
now would run parallel criticism by Sarris and Kauffmann, as the New
York Times once did, pitting Sarris' credo against my own on the
front page of the Arts and Leisure section. More's the pity, but at
least now we have two challenging film books that accomplish the
same: "Regarding Film," Kauffmann's latest collection, and "Citizen
Sarris." The former is mostly criticism; the latter is a festschrift,
a celebratory volume of essays by many hands.</TE>
<TE>   Of the egghead critics, Kauffmann is the least dogmatic and the
least elitist. For more than 40 years, he has been writing about film
in The New Republic and elsewhere and teaching film courses at Yale,
Hunter College and beyond. His is a civilized, easygoing style,
though not chattily egocentric like Kael's or cultishly soul-baring
like Sarris' or olympianly ironic like Macdonald's. He is a man at
home in film history, conversant with culture and the arts,
informative without being preachy, using his writing to think about
his subject and pleased to take us into his confidence.</TE>
<TE>   He is most certainly a master of the felicitous phrase and
memorable characterization. So he describes Emma Thompson as the
"first film actress since Katharine Hepburn to make intelligence
sexy"; he finds in "Amistad" "a sense of presence in the past" he
hasn't experienced since Bergman's "The Virgin Spring"; and he notes
that Oliver Stone "in appalling measure" succeeds in "Natural Born
Killers." He is acute about "Pulp Fiction," which "nourishes, abets
cultural slumming [with] calculated grunginess." Sensitive to
cinematography, he writes of "Stalingrad," "the colors don't
glamorize, they confirm," and in the camera work of "Sister My
Sister," he finds "the everyday put before us as evidence of
strangeness." In "Carrington," "appurtenances of class and of
conscious bohemianism are integral to the characters themselves, not
imposed as decor. Setting and story are unified."</TE>
<TE>   He is an equally good judge of acting. Take this analysis of the
two stars who have portrayed Humbert Humbert in "Lolita": "James
Mason is the ideal Humbert. He gives us a doomed man, conscious of
it, accepting it. [Jeremy] Irons in the role [gives] it his customary
vestments of intelligence and sensitive reticence, but at his deepest
he is no more than melancholy. Mason suggested a tragic fall." And,
much as he admires Julianne Moore, he finds her "frigid" in "The End
of the Affair," leaving the great moments "uninflected."</TE>
<TE>   Knowledgeableness is quietly integrated, not flashily displayed.
Thus Kauffmann notices in Warren Beatty's "Bulworth" an
unacknowledged debt not only to Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe" but
also to a Finnish and a Ukrainian film. He can be understatedly but
effectively witty, as about "Fargo": "The hot news about Joel and
Ethan Coen is that they have made a tolerable film." About "Touch of
Evil": "Heston's attempts to be a dashing young man were painful even
when he was young." Or, at greater length, apropos Mike Leigh's film
about them: "If Gilbert had never met Sullivan [a clause that makes
me shudder as I write it], he would still have a small place in
literary history. Sullivan without Gilbert would now be remembered as
the composer of 'The Lost Chord' and 'Onward Christian Soldiers.'"</TE>
<TE>   In "Regarding Film," there are also impressive essays on various
attempts to adapt opera to the screen, on the changing attitudes of
moviegoers toward film and film criticism, on the problems of
documenting the Holocaust and on the careers of Akira Kurosawa, Billy
Wilder and David Lean. Only once, in a brief obituary notice for
James Stewart, does Kauffmann become a rather too prideful fan.</TE>
<TE>   My own cavils with Kauffmann concern what I consider his
overpraise of the filmmakers David O. Russell, Neil LaBute, Todd
Solondz and Peter Sellars. Nor do I share his enthusiasm for Wallace
Shawn, Ben Stiller, Jim Jarmusch and Chantal Akerman. Much more
rarely, I find him overcritical, as of Giulietta Masina in "Nights of
Cabiria."</TE>
<TE>   But as critics know, agreement matters much less than recognition
of the ability to summon up the memory of films enjoyed, to evoke the
pleasure of and build up the appetite for films unseen and, on
privileged occasions, to change our long-held but obsolete critical
estimates. There is humane wisdom in these pieces, as when Kauffmann,
noting that the 10-year-old Billy Wilder witnessed Emperor Franz
Josef's funeral, is reminded "yet again how short and how long a
century is." Or when he reflects on something magical that happened
to some men born at the right time for the arrival of film to
transform them. Without it, "Josef von Sternberg might have spent his
life in the lace business; Howard Hawks might have remained an
engineer, William A. Wellman an aviator .... Lean might have browned
out his life as a London accountant." So too did Kauffmann discover
film criticism at the right time, to his and everybody's gain.</TE>
<TE>   Such praise is more difficult when assessing the work of Sarris.
While there is no underestimating Sarris' effect on his readers and
his film students at Columbia University--auteurism called long
overdue attention to the importance of the director--his particular
categories, as covered in his 1968 "The American Cinema" (the greatly
influential catalogue raisonne that listed and rated the works of 200
mostly, but not exclusively, American directors) are more
questionable.</TE>
<TE>   About who belongs in which category ("Pantheon Directors," "The
Far Side of Paradise," "Expressive Esoterica," "Lightly Likable,"
"Less Than Meets the Eye" and "Strained Seriousness," to name a few),
not to mention the worth of individual films, I am in enormous
disagreement. I cannot begin to understand how someone could have sat
through the oeuvre of the likes of Edgar G. Ulmer and Joseph H. Lewis
or placed Samuel Fuller, Anthony Mann and Budd Boetticher (who is one
of the contributors to the book) on pedestals. And I do not share the
exaggerated passion for Max Ophuls (though I'm glad to learn that
Sarris no longer considers "Lola Montes" the greatest film ever
made), F.W. Murnau and Sternberg (the aristocratic von is pure
fabrication). Conversely I cannot comprehend Sarris' contempt for
John Huston, Elia Kazan and Lean or the outbursts against Fred
Zinnemann. And although I enjoy some John Ford westerns, I consign
anyone considering "The Searchers" a masterpiece (as most
contributors here do) beyond the critical pale.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every contributor to "Citizen Sarris" dwells raptly on
Sarris' "passion." Why is it that critics of the other arts are not
so glorified for their passion? Is it because it is understood that
they love their fields and passion would merely imply blindness and
besottedness? Or is it that film, as a newer medium, required such
fanatical passion to give it full respectibility ?</TE>
<TE>   Passion is, of itself, no fault except when it descends into
sanctification that ranges from fervid adulation to ferocious
zealotry. Profuse but undiscriminating quotations from Sarris'
writings and spectacularly exaggerated ways of extolling Sarris'
style, intended as homage, have the opposite effect, and the
acolytes, encouraged by the master's ecstatic self-revelations,
indulge in their own unrestrained autobiography. Regrettably "Citizen
Sarris" is the worst-edited book I have ever read, and most of the
writing in it isn't much better.</TE>
<TE>   What, in retrospect, was the significance of the populist-egghead
controversy? It made clear that there were two standards by which
movies could be evaluated. In essence, the populists exalted the
B-movie, which offered technique above content, fun above depth,
strictly cinematic values to which all others were subordinated.
Conversely, the eggheads, while not ignoring technique, considered
moral, social, political, psychological and aesthetic questions of
equal importance.</TE>
<TE>   The way all this has translated into today's practices is as a
recession of the egghead approach and dilution of even the populist
one. Reviewing has become largely simplistic consumer guidance, with
the broader, more speculative view rarely in evidence and
decreasingly in demand.</TE>

<DH>HAROLD LLOYD: Master Comedian, By Jeffrey Vance and Suzanne
Lloyd, Harry N. Abrams: 240 pp., $45</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Turan is film critic for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He will always be the third man, fated to spend eternity behind
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as the last of silent film comedy's
holy trinity. Still, that doesn't mean that Harold Lloyd's profile
couldn't be raised a bit, which is what co-authors Jeffrey Vance
("Buster Keaton Remembered") and Suzanne Lloyd, the star's
granddaughter, aim to do with this handsome volume.</LD>
<LD>   The man Orson Welles called "the most underrated comedian of them
all" made more than 200 comedies over a 34-year career, including
classic 1920s features like "Safety Last!," "The Freshman" and
"Speedy." The popularity of Lloyd's horn-rimmed, go-getting Everyman,
as well as the actor's business acumen, made him the wealthiest of
the silent clowns, able to finance his own films and build
Greenacres, a 44-room, 32,000-square-foot Italian Renaissance villa
in Benedict Canyon. His control of his material has made this an
especially beautiful book; nearly 3,000 original nitrate still
negatives exist, and most of the pictures reproduced are
first-generation images.</LD>
<TE>   Nor does "Harold Lloyd" shy away from being honest about its
subject's personal life, noting his chronic infidelities and his
numerous superstitions (not stepping on cracks in the sidewalk was
only one). But most of the focus is on his features, especially
thrill comedies like "Safety Last!," the source of one of the most
iconic images in all of silent history: Lloyd precariously hanging
from the hands of a clock high above downtown Los Angeles. Like that
tenacious character, Lloyd succeeded by act of will as much as by
anything else. A hard-working perfectionist who employed numerous gag
writers and was one of the pioneers in testing films, Lloyd, said
producer Hal Roach, a longtime friend and collaborator, "was not a
comedian. He was the best actor I ever saw being a comedian."</TE>
<TE>   How well he did will be visible when Lloyd's features--digitally
restored and rescored--are rebroadcast on Turner Classic Movies in
May and take over the screen at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
during the summer. If, as Kevin Brownlow says in the introduction,
Lloyd "has been treated shabbily by history," he's getting his moment
now.</TE>

<HD>Less Is So Much More</HD>
<DH>IN THE BEDROOM, Seven Stories, By Andre Dubus, Vintage: 150
pp., $11 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOBIAS WOLFF</AU>
<BD>Tobias Wolff is director of the creative writing
department at Stanford University and the author of many books,
including "This Boy's Life: A Memoir" and "The Night in Question:
Stories."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good fiction rarely translates into good movies. This is a tired bit
of truth, but it's still a truth. How do you film a voice? How do you
film the unsaid thoughts and ripples of feeling that make us who we
are? It's possible for a character in a story to have the most
important moment of her life while lying in bed alone: How do you put
that across on screen without resorting to some portentous
voice-over?</LD>
<LD>   But once in a while a movie gets it right, and "In the Bedroom" is
that movie. It somehow re-creates the moral atmosphere and emotional
texture of its source--the late Andre Dubus' story
"Killings"--without trying to be literature; from first to last it's
a movie, and a damned good movie, maybe even a great movie. Now the
director, Todd Field, has taken the trouble to thank Dubus for his
inspirational work by gathering seven of his stories together under
the title of the film. I hope--as Field obviously does--that this
will have the effect of drawing some of the movie's many admirers to
this great writer.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of an early novel, "The Lieutenant," Dubus
devoted himself to the short story, and his best achievements in that
form belong on the same shelf with those of his teachers Chekhov and
Hemingway. The stories in this book show him in the fullness of his
voice, his humanity and range; and each is a masterpiece of its kind.</LD>
<TE>   Reading through them ensemble, I was struck by their plenitude.
Part of the pleasure of writing short stories is learning what you
can live without. The form relies on an acute, watchful reader--an
aficionado, really--who is insulted by fat explanation, fat
description, by anything reducible to something more essential; but
the consciousness of that scrutiny can lead to a chill, starved sort
of story in which the writer seems hesitant to tell you anything at
all for fear of being common. I know; I've written a few.</TE>
<TE>   Dubus never succumbed to this anorexic impulse. His language is
full-throated, and he's not afraid to linger on the undramatic, even
languorous moments in which we define ourselves--conversation over a
barbecue, a divorced father driving home alone after dropping off his
kids. Dubus takes his time; his stories, like his sentences, tend to
run long. But that vigilant reader prowling the flock for bloated
stragglers will never catch Dubus out, because at his most complex,
he is still irreducible.</TE>
<TE>   Look at this passage from "The Winter Father," in which the newly
divorced father imagines a place where men like him can take their
kids on weekends: "A place of swimming pools, badminton and tennis
courts, movie theaters, restaurants, soda fountains, batting cages, a
zoo, an art gallery, a circus, aquarium, science museum, hundreds of
restrooms, two always in sight...." It's a list, yes, but you
wouldn't want to shrink it; its grimly comic progression heightens
our sense of the father's desperation to entertain children whose
comfort in casual, unplanned intimacy has been destroyed by divorce.
But from such a cascade of images, Dubus can effortlessly move to a
rending, isolated moment, the father scraping the inside of his
windshield the next morning and realizing that "the grey ice curling
and falling from the glass was the frozen breath of his children."</TE>
<TE>   These are ordinary things, ordinary moments raised to the level of
art by a luminous quality of attention that Dubus lavishes on his
people as well. They are richly imagined, the women at least as
vividly as the men--without a shade of male fantasy or
condescension--and if he believed in evil people, he must not have
found them very interesting, because they don't figure much in his
work. What he is interested in is our attempt to act rightly when the
right is not clear, to secure justice in situations where one man's
good is another man's ill.</TE>
<TE>   "Killings" is a good example of this endless, unsatisfactory
sorting-out. Another, my favorite, is "A Father's Story." In it the
pious, amiable Luke Ripley stages a coverup for his daughter after a
drunken car accident in which she kills a boy. Luke is acting out of
love, the particular protective love of a father for a daughter, and
so absolves himself of guilt, even comparing his love for her to
God's love for us. But what he cannot see is that in removing his
daughter from the process of confession and punishment, he has
isolated her forever from the human community, binding her in
unexpiated guilt.</TE>
<TE>   This is a dark, complex portrait of a man destroying his daughter
in the name of love, never imagining that a greater love would allow
her the freedom to act responsibly and redeem herself. A great story,
it reveals in its ironies and self-contradictions that rare writer
who can write at once passionately and unsentimentally of love, of
its power to rescue us from the prison of self-regard and to blind us
to the havoc we wreak in its service.</TE>

<DH>Nominees Nicole Kidman and Helen Mirren discuss voices,
roles and the directors in their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Mirren and Nicole Kidman haven't met before this moment--the
afternoon after the Academy Awards' nominee luncheon earlier this
month. This is a blind date, at the behest of the Los Angeles Times,
but that doesn't stop the pair from gabbing, about the actor's life,
everything from hemorrhaging vocal cords and stage fright, to the
idiosyncrasies of directors and the actresses' mutual love of
Vegemite, a distinctly non-American affection for yeast extract.</LD>
<LD>   Mirren, most famous for her role as Detective Inspector Jane
Tennison in the British TV series "Prime Suspect," arrived in sleek
black pants and a black sweater. At 56, she's trim and petite and
half a foot shorter than the 34-year old Kidman, who is at once
ethereal and vaguely saucy in a frothy cream-colored slip she found
in a flea market and turned into a dress.</LD>
<TE>   Mirren has been nominated as best supporting actress for her role
as the steely chief housekeeper in Robert Altman's "Upstairs
Downstairs"-style murder-mystery "Gosford Park," while Kidman earned
her best actress nomination for her portrayal of the doomed courtesan
Satine in Baz Luhrmann's extravagant musical "Moulin Rouge." It's
hard to imagine two more disparate performances, but together, they
exemplify almost the complete range of the female experience, from
Kidman's sassy exhibitionism, with its undercurrent of vulnerability,
to Mirren's self-abnegating stoicism, a muted passion play rendered
in a thousand shades of gray.</TE>
<TE>   The two have appeared on both stage and screen.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Mirren: People often ask me, which is your favorite thing,
theater or film? And, I would say, which is the absolute truth, the
one that I don't happen to be doing at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Kidman: Yeah [laughing].</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: And it all has to do with sleep. When you're doing
theater, you think, oh, film is so easy by comparison, and then when
you're doing film, you think, if I didn't have to get up early in the
morning, wouldn't it be so wonderful? Did you enjoy the theater?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman [who appeared in the "The Blue Room" in London and New York
in 1998]: Oh, I loved it, but I lost my voice in the last week, which
was harrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I just lost my voice in "Dance of Death" [recently on
Broadway]. I had to take two shows off.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: I had to take the whole last week. It was devastating. I
lost it on the stage, while I was screaming as the character. I had a
cold, and I was screaming, and suddenly, it was a surreal moment,
gone! The voice was just gone. There was just nothing. And as an
actor, it's the most horrifying thing. Because I then get into the
whole panic. I'm like out of Woody Allen, where, oh no, that means
it'll never come back. It means there's something dreadfully wrong
now with my voice.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I can imagine. But I was told when I was doing "Dance of
Death," if I went on the stage that night, I was in danger of
destroying my voice for good, because it had hemorrhaged.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: That's what I had! I'm so glad it happened to someone
else. I felt like such a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: It was mortifying not to do the show.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: But you have to. I've realized the most important thing an
actor has is their voice.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: In fact, it was funny with the little SAG Award (which
Mirren won for best supporting actress), they've got no mouth. He's
an actor, and he's got no mouth. That's a strange decision for them
to make. That's the most important thing to have. And you understand
on stage as well how psychological the voice is. Every nuance of
insecurity within yourself and fear and everything, how amazingly it
comes out in the voice, without you being able to control it at all.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Neither of you are Americans. Do you feel like outsiders
in Hollywood?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I think Hollywood has always been made up of people from
other places.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Everyone feels like an outsider. You never feel like
you're in the club. Someone said very interestingly, "When you step
foot in Hollywood, you feel like a failure." For some reason, no
matter how successful you've been, you always feel like you're not
really good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I'm not an actress in Hollywood. I don't even sort of
appear on the radar screen in Hollywood in actress terms. But I am
married to an American film director [Taylor Hackford], whose world
is Hollywood. So I sort of see it from two different perspectives.
I've come to respect the industry side of it and how incredibly
well-organized it is.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: How long have you been with Taylor?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Well, we were together for 15 or 16 years and then got
married, which is a good way to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Wow! I'm going to take that advice. I'm very sure.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Very sure, and it was time.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: You did it in Scotland. I was in Britain when you got
married, and it was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Yes, because I never wanted to get married and I'd been
quoted very often saying I wasn't interested in marriage and I
wasn't. I never was.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Did he propose a lot?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: We talked about it but when you're together that long,
it's not a "will you marry me?" kind of thing. You know you're going
to spend the rest of your life together by then anyway. So we had a
four-day wedding for 16 people and ... no ancient aunts, just really
good friends and really close family. Anyway, that's the marriage
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you prepare for your roles?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: When I'm working and I see somebody else's film, I rarely
take the film in, but I come up with great ideas during that [time].
It gives me the time to think about my character. I think it's
because you're sitting alone in a dark space.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: It's background while you're thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Yeah, I can actually daydream during the film.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I find myself sort of walking around, shopping. I'm not
actually shopping, I'm just walking around the shops, often with my
lines, and I find that a quick way to learn. So shopping is perfect
for thinking. I find, going into a film, is a little bit like going
into a nunnery. You're in this tunnel, and until the film's done,
you're not really going to come out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: You have no life.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: You have no life, and I can't sort of have lots and lots
of fun on the set. I hope I'm reasonably nice on the set, but I can't
socialize, especially on the kind of schedule that I work.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: The concentration that it takes. I just did this Lars von
Trier movie. We had six weeks to shoot the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How was it working on that film?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: It's all set on the soundstages. It's very Brechtian. We
don't use props. We just have this chalk on the ground, where the
town exists, and it's interesting because we wanted to make a film
where you take the walls away in society and how you can actually see
everybody doing their business as if they were in town. So all the
actors had to be there all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Oh really, like in "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: The dog in the film is actually the chalk mark, and we all
sort of go to pat the dog, but the dog is just a chalk mark. It's
either going to work or it's going to be a disaster. I was very
frightened.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was so frightening about it?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Certain people that I'd run into would tell me stories
about him. The Chinese whispers--they can be so detrimental. So, I
went there thinking, "Oh my gosh, I'm in a bit of a fragile state,
and this is probably not the smartest thing to be doing right now,"
because the script, it was pretty harrowing. But then I got there,
and the first week was rocky, and he said, "I want to take these
walks with you in the forest." And it would snow, and we'd go off
into the forest, three or four times a week, and we'd just talk, hold
hands, and walk in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I love that.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Sounds very like a fairy tale. He had written this film
for me. I was in every scene, and that was the journey that we were
going to take, and the walks suddenly became as important as the
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I was just thinking about that relationship between actors
and directors. It is really, really misunderstood by the public at
large. It's also misunderstood by lots of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: That's so true.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: The great director just--I mean, what do they do? I'm not
sure that I can actually articulate it. But I know it's something to
do with making an environment comfortable enough for you to create
within.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Steering you, guiding you, prompting you. Altman loves
actors, doesn't he?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: In a very practical way. He's not real sentimental about
actors. He's very practical and not a lot of stroking goes on and not
a lot of "oh, that was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: What's really lovely, off the camera, is the little tiny
hand movement that says, "Got it."</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: If you think they mean it. [Sotto voce, a little play
between herself and the presumed director:]</TE>
<TE>   "We've got it, Helen."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes, yes, love. We've got it."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: What about "Oh, don't worry, I'll be able to piece it
together." It's sort of like you failed me.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Bob Balaban, who is one of the producers of "Gosford Park"
and also acts in it, and I did a film called "2010," here in
Hollywood. And one day he gave me the most brilliant piece of acting
advice. He said film acting is like Zen. He said you aim the arrow
and then you let it go, just let it land where it will, because you
can't really control where it's going to land. You think you're
aiming at the bull's-eye of the performance but, with film, you never
really know, because film is so ...</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Because they edit it.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: But also just the thing of film on one's face. You look at
it after and you go, I didn't know that I did that.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Do you watch dailies?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: No. I can't handle dailies for that very reason. I'd be
obsessive. I'd want to go back and reshoot everything.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In "Moulin Rouge," you descend from the ceiling on a trapeze.
What was it like making that scene?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Well, that was sort of one of the cinematic highlights, I
think, in my life. I love anything that's slightly dangerous. So I
got to up on this trapeze, with all these men in tuxedos below and
Baz calling out things like, "All right men, we want unbridled lust,"
and they'd be screaming and cheering and throwing their hats, and I'd
be looking down at them from up on the trapeze and I'd go, "Remember
this moment." We were doing a night scene shoot actually, it was 11
o'clock at night, and I called my dad because he loves musicals. I
said, "Dad, come out to the set. You're going to see something kind
of fun." He was in his pajamas, and he got dressed and came out, and
he was just so thrilled that he got to see that moment.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Helen, your role in "Gosford Park" is so interior. How do you
focus?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I love night filming. I love coming to the set at night
and there are lights in the sky and everyone else is asleep,
especially if it's out in the country and you see the lights through
the trees. It's so sort of extraordinary, magical. There are all the
caravans and the cables and the lighting truck, and you go down,
down, and there's the set, where all the lights are on, and then
there's the director, then there's the actor. So the whole process
really kind of helps you. Sometimes you can use all the complications
and the technical and the hardness of the film set. You can kind of
use it; it concentrates down to one blink of a bloody eyelid.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As actresses, both of you have been moving toward more
expressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Me more than Helen. You've always been more expressive.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: No, no. For me, the whole constant journey as an actor is
the journey toward freedom that I don't feel I have at all. I feel
sometimes like a rabbit paralyzed in the headlights of a car. Maybe,
at the end of my career I'll finally hit it, as all actors do.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: I'll tell you, every man I've worked with, Helen, every
British man. I remember sitting in the rehearsal room for "Blue
Room," and your name came up and they all went, "Oh, she's so sexy!"
All of them, Sam Mendes and Iain Glen, David Hare, they're like,
"She's hot!" Isn't that nice?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: That's not true. They're lying.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: I was there. I was listening to it, and that was just to
name a few .</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: It's nice, actually. It's great.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: They're going to kill me. They'll be embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: My great inspiration for film acting is of babies and
dogs, because if there's a scene with a baby in it, I cannot take my
eyes off the baby. It doesn't matter who's in the scene with the
baby. It could be the most brilliant, inspiring, fabulous
actor/actress ever, but my eyes will be glued to the baby because
there's something just so free, magical, innocent, alive, and no
actor can compare with that. And the same with dogs. They just have
this absolute purity of expression.</TE>
<TE>   Q (to Nicole): It seems as if "To Die For" was the beginning of a
transformation for you.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: "To Die For," and then I did "Portrait of a Lady" straight
after it. Jane Campion I would credit with just kind of saying to me,
"Go into yourself and give from your soul." Once you feel vulnerable
enough, then you sort of go [breathing out], "Uuh." I try to do it
now, very early on in the rehearsal period, so I feel really, really
exposed and vulnerable and insecure. And then it's kind of like, "OK,
[the director] kind of sees me." You either connect or you don't
connect.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: The sooner you do it the better.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Yeah, but I'm one of the worst table readers. Are you good
at a table read? Yes, you would be.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: No, I don't think I am because I'm very lazy, and I hardly
ever read a script all the way to the end.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you decide to do a movie or not?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Well, I already read the script backward. I jump to the
end and then I go back if it's good enough. But I look to see if my
character is on the last page. If it's on the last page, it means
it's a good role, in general.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: That's funny! I'm going to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: And if it's not on the last page, I see the last time it
appears in the script, and if that's a really good scene, best of all
if she dies, that's excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Then you would have liked "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: "Moulin Rouge"--I'd go for that role, definitely, sign me
up. I wouldn't have to read it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the biggest misconception that directors have about
you?</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: I think it's that I'm tough and intelligent. Two great
mistakes. I'm not tough and I'm not intelligent [lots of laughter
from both women].</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: In the last year, personally, I've been exposed in a very
raw way, which has been strange for me. I'm at a crossroads now, so I
wouldn't have a clue how I'm viewed or not viewed because I feel
really vulnerable. It's a very strange feeling to have when you're
going through such a public display, and I don't mean just in terms
of my personal life or my divorce [from actor Tom Cruise], but even
being nominated for an Oscar at this stage of my career. All the
things that have happened have happened in such a small period of
time and so intensely.</TE>
<TE>   I get a lot of people saying to me, "We're worried about you
because you seem very fragile." That's not just my mother. I suppose
in some ways your fragility is the thing you protect, but you also
don't want to lose it. So much of your work is saying, I'm willing to
be exposed, and I'm willing to be manipulated, and I'm willing to
display these emotions on screen, and I'm going to give them to a Baz
Luhrmann or a Lars von Trier, or an Alejandro Amenabar ["The
Others"], and I'm going to let him do with them what he's going to
do.</TE>
<TE>   Q (to Kidman): This year was such a breakthrough. How did it
happen?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: I don't know. I just think in some ways being forced into
such a vulnerable position made me open up. Through my whole decade
of life with Tom, he was such a huge force and I was willing to not
be. And I didn't want to be. Women in their 30s suddenly say, "I have
to define myself" and I want to also not have barriers between me and
other people. I like to be who I am. I have no other way of
explaining it. I just happened to have two films with two interesting
directors, particularly with Baz who basically held my hand through
the whole year.</TE>
<TE>   He was my life force. He took me under his wing. Some people have
boyfriends. I have directors coming into my life.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I saw you at the Golden Globes, and you seemed very nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Actually, in Cannes, I had one of those things where you
get panicky and you start to shake. I never had that happen to that
extreme. It's really embarrassing, but all the emotions gets
heightened.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: Especially at Cannes. Cannes is an absolute madhouse,
isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Kidman: Yeah, and the Academy Awards were [big], but I always went
with Tom, and I always would grab his arm, and he's very calm and
collected at those things, and I would hold onto him like a rock.
Anyway, [I've got] my sister. My sister's my rock. You've got Taylor.
You need a rock.</TE>
<TE>   Mirren: You need a rock, absolutely, someone you can hold onto.
It's definitely a good idea.</TE>

<DH>Party rocker Andrew W.K. doesn't bother with pretense. 'Why
would I whisper when I can scream?' he asks.</DH>

<LD>It takes a lot of charisma to make filthy white jeans and greasy hair
alluring, but Andrew W.K. has somehow managed it, just as he's
managed to make some of the biggest, dumbest, loudest and most
compelling anthem rock to come along since Slade and Meat Loaf.</LD>
<LD>   With many of the songs on his debut album, "I Get Wet,"
shamelessly devoted to partying, it would be easy to dismiss this
23-year-old singer as a musical parody, a la Spinal Tap. But there is
no irony in his head-banging, hair-swinging, fist-pumping metal
celebrations. When Andrew W.K. serves up a song titled "It's Time to
Party," he means it as an "unconditional, open-ended invitation" for
everyone to enjoy life as much as he does.</LD>
<LD>   "I want [listeners] to feel good about themselves, to feel good
about me and feel better about the people around them, and about
things to come and all things that have happened," says the tall,
dark and scruffy W.K. the day after his recent L.A. debut at the
Whisky.</LD>
<TE>   That spirit was very much in evidence on stage. Whether it was
"Party Til You Puke" or another of his seemingly dunderheaded songs,
the highly animated performer took time out from his air splits and
karate kicks to smile and shake hands with enthusiastic fans. He even
let a lucky few share the spotlight for a second before they dived
back into the crowd, an especially generous move because there was
hardly any room on stage between him and his five musicians.</TE>
<TE>   W.K.'s music is nothing if not dense, with three thundering
guitars, keyboards, thrashing drums and W.K.'s netherworldly vocals.
A rave review in the Village Voice said his new record "could rouse
even Ozzy to kick the camera crew out of his house, grab a bottle of
Jack, peel out of his driveway and head out on a quest for the
nearest kegger." Any way you slice it, his music is loud, and that's
just the way he wants it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other option. That's how music should be. The world is
big, huge, loud, exciting, slamming, beautiful, magnificent and
grand," says W.K., who is in the midst of a six-week U.S. tour for
the album. "Why would I whisper when I can scream? Why would I not
use everything that I have at my little hands to make something that
says how excited I am about life?"</TE>
<TE>   His record won't be out until Tuesday, but W.K. is already working
to create an even bigger sound on his next release. He plans to add
five more people to his act so there will be two drummers, three
keyboardists and two "rabble-rousers"--guys with microphones who can
run around the stage pumping up the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   W.K. not only thinks big, he is big--tall and muscular. In person,
he has so much energy you almost expect him to spontaneously combust.
During lunch in the '50s-retro diner of the Standard Hotel on the
Sunset Strip, he barely touches his sea bass and asparagus,
preferring instead to chat excitedly about his album and to fiddle
with the beaded curtain near the table.</TE>
<TE>   An irrepressible optimist with a down-to-earth demeanor, direct
stare and blinding smile, he exudes an unexpected friendliness. He
even says "please" and "thank you" to the waiter.</TE>
<TE>   It's unexpected because this is a guy who hit himself in the face
with a brick so his nose would bleed in his album cover photo, a guy
who scowls in every other printed photo.</TE>
<TE>   No rock star pomposity or dementia here, so why the crazy faces?
"The world is a free place," he says. "This music is freedom. I can
do whatever I want at all times. It doesn't have to make sense. I
just like people to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew W.K. was born in L.A. but raised in Ypsilanti, Mich., where
his father is a law professor at the nearby University of Michigan.
The W.K. stands for Wilkes-Krier, a combination of his mother's and
father's last names.</TE>
<TE>   Although W.K. has been said to mean "White Killer," "Wild Kid" and
other things, these acronymic Rorschach tests are not his doing.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I've ever said is this: Who Knows?"</TE>
<TE>   He has been called Andrew W.K. since elementary school, when a
teacher used the name to differentiate him from two other kids in his
class--Andrew Cohen and Andrew Gilchrist. Although he used his full
name when he began recording, W.K. is just easier, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He started playing piano at age 4. Later, he learned to play
guitar and drums. Although he grew up listening to his parents'
classical records, he converted to the metal subgenre known as
grindcore as a teen. After playing in a few death-metal bands in the
Detroit area, he moved to New York at 18. There he worked as a
bubblegum machine salesman, parking attendant and waiter while
masterminding his music at home. His goal: to make "the most exciting
music possible."</TE>
<TE>   For the next couple of years he played "any show, any place, any
time. I would do whatever it takes to continue on. That was my
mind-set: Whatever it takes. The most miserable 10-hour bus ride to
play for 10 people? Whatever it takes."</TE>
<TE>   Using a boom box, keyboard and microphone, he performed at
Starbucks and other coffee shops and at art galleries, handing out
home-recorded CDs to whoever wanted them. Through a "friend of a
friend of a friend," his debut EP, "Girls Own Juice," released on
Michigan-based Bulb Records in 1999, made its way to Dave Grohl. The
former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman liked the CD
so much he invited W.K. to open a few dates during his group's tour.</TE>
<TE>   W.K. accepted, although he was frustrated because he didn't have a
band. "I'd go out there with my microphone and run around in a
circle, basically, as fast as I could."</TE>
<TE>   That same year, he moved to Seffner, Fla.--population 37,000--to
start a band with Donald "D.T." Tardy, the drummer for Obituary, a
defunct '80s death metal group from the nearby town of Brandon.
Earlier, W.K.'s manager had contacted Tardy to tell him "how this guy
was just freaking on me and how he loves my drumming and how I should
check it out," Tardy told Kerrang! magazine in October. Tardy joined
W.K. to form a band, which he recruited from his circle of friends .</TE>
<TE>   His group intact, W.K. sought a major-label deal. He was rejected
by several record companies before being picked up by Island two
years ago on the strength of a demo tape.</TE>
<TE>   W.K., who rents a room from a friend for $100 a month, is rarely
home these days. Earlier this year he was on the road in Europe. When
his U.S. tour ends in May, he'll head to Japan and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   W.K. travels light. His luggage consists of a black backpack and a
white plastic grocery bag. Clearly, he doesn't allow himself to be
weighed down by such things as clothes, of which he has just a few.
The back cover of "I Get Wet" shows W.K. after what appears to have
been a daylong swim in a swamp, wearing what is fast becoming his
look--a dirty T-shirt and faded-to-white Levi's.</TE>
<TE>   He wears it offstage. He wears it on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows up well," W.K. says of the way he dresses. "That wasn't
even the idea initially. There was no idea. That's just what I wore.
I played shows and wore jeans and T-shirts."</TE>
<TE>   W.K. likes the simplicity of the outfit for himself and listeners,
who are less likely to be distracted. They "can just get into the
heart of the matter--get wet--get into the core of what's going on,
which is dancing and these songs and smiling and running around."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the day, W.K. is at the hotel for a photo shoot. It's for
the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch "magalog," which will have a music feature
about him in its summer issue. W.K. opts for the T-shirt and jeans,
even though the stylist has brought a rainbow of vintage Adidas
sweatsuits for him to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   He spends two minutes with the makeup artist, then hits the couch
for pictures. It isn't long before he's couch surfing, balancing on
one leg and yukking it up for the lens--crossing his eyes, baring his
teeth, flexing his biceps and generally acting like a monkey. He's as
much a natural for the camera as he is for radio.</TE>
<TE>   Some have described W.K.'s music as speed metal with a pop twist,
or beautiful melodies played with aggression. One critic said his
music sounded like puking garbage trucks. Another described him as a
death-metal Elton John.</TE>
<TE>   In a pop world that's lost much of its ability to develop
interesting and original characters, it's no wonder the media have
latched onto him. He's as much a cultural phenomenon as a musician:
England's pop weekly NME--in its typical overstated enthusiasm--has
put W.K. on its cover twice in the last five months, declaring him
"bigger than Jesus" and the "saviour of music." England's the Face
magazine called him "the first great rock star of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   But W.K. isn't letting the journalistic hyperbole go to his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really affect me at all. I don't think anything needs
to be saved. I don't think things are awful and I've come along to
fix them. I don't think there's ever been a better time to be alive,"
says W.K., exuding a calm confidence devoid of pretense. "I'm just
happy to be here. I'm honored and very, very happy that people like
the same thing I like. That's how I take it. "</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everyone is a fan. His music tends to provoke extreme
responses. At the Whisky, crowd reaction was mixed. Plenty of
die-hards jumped up and down and sang along, but just as many people
stood motionless. They had heard the hype but were waiting to be
converted. Then again, his record isn't out yet, and it only gets
better with repeated listening.</TE>
<TE>   "You either totally love it or you don't," says Lewis Largent, the
executive who signed W.K. to Island. "I think it's really good for
music that there is no middle ground."</TE>

<HD>Looking Both Ways Across the Border</HD>
<DH>At UC Riverside, artists working in different media examine
lives and cultural images in the U.S. and Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The border is a line between two cultures, drawn by history and by
politics, and the one between the United States and Mexico is often
an uneasy one. "There are millions of people living along that
border," says Karen Rapp, associate director of the Sweeney Art
Gallery at UC Riverside. "And they tend to be marginalized by most
Americans and by people from Mexico City." Rapp organized "Lines of
Sight: Views of the U.S./Mexican Border," opening March 27, because,
she says, "artists are saying we need to recognize these people and
their lives."</LD>
<LD>   Prompted by the fact that several university departments
coordinated a border studies program for the academic year, the
gallery and its board decided to do something along the same theme.
Josh Kun, professor of English at the university, had seen some
photographs by Julian Cardona that seemed right for this project.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the photograph that really struck me," says Rapp, as she
points to one of Cardona's large color prints. It depicts a
fresh-faced young assembly worker, 14, who has been caught in a
moment of gazing over her workspace and into the distance. "She looks
rather wistful, really."</LD>
<TE>   What might she be thinking? What might she be dreaming? And will
these things ever be possible? The poignancy is that with her limited
education and limited income (earning perhaps $1.50 an hour), the
horizon is limited.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the gallery found several other artists to add to the
show--photographer Yvonne Venegas, painter Ricardo Duffy and
multimedia veteran Ruben Ortiz Torres, who weighs in with sculpture
and video pieces. Kun, who also DJs at Club Sugar in Santa Monica
once a month, contributes a sound collage, "The Aural Border," a
splice of Mexican pop and electronic music with bits of radio and
Perry Como singing a creamy version of "South of the Border."</TE>
<TE>   In his catalog essay, Kun writes that the 1990s saw the greatest
militarization of the U.S.-Mexican border since the creation of the
border in 1848. (The main border surveillance station, the
headquarters of U. S. Customs Service Command, Control,
Communications and Intelligence, is based in Riverside.) At the same
time, trade agreements have made the Mexican side of the border a
haven for the maquiladoras, the manufacturing plants of international
companies, seeking cheap labor.</TE>
<TE>   For Rapp, Duffy's works help "to anchor the show in some of that
history." His prints and paintings use images from north and south of
the border--from a Coca-Cola bottle to a crucifix, from the Marlboro
man to homeless people--with all the implications of power and
oppression those juxtapositions create.</TE>
<TE>   One of the artist's favorite images, appearing in several works,
is adapted from a road sign on U.S. freeways near the border--a
depiction of a family (father, mother and child) holding hands and
fleeing, meant to warn drivers of pedestrians--illegal
immigrants--running across the highway. For Duffy, it has other
meanings as well. "It could be me, it could be my family running for
a better life in their own world," says Duffy, a Chicano born in Los
Angeles County and now living in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   As someone concerned with current events, he addresses what he
perceives as ongoing racism that started with the arrival of the
Spanish conquistadors in the Western Hemisphere. In "Curtain Raiser"
(1997), a Border Patrol car, driven by Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse,
has three Native Americans in the back seat. The car's hood ornament
is a conquistador, his sword point emitting a pool of blood.</TE>
<TE>   In the foreground, a snarling jaguar threatens to leap off the
canvas. "That's my alter ego, in defiance," Duffy says. The shadows
of the road-sign running family are superimposed across the jaguar's
body, while a green card, dated 1492, the year of Columbus' landing
in the New World, is on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, multimedia artist Torres sees borderland mixings in a
comical, if surreal, light in his videos and sculpture. "Alien Toy,"
from 1997, is an eight-minute video collage that features a
customized pickup truck, which flips off its top and sides and spins
them around (an actual truck made by San Ysidro car customizer
Salvador Munoz), interspersed with pictures of E.T.-like aliens and
Border Patrol logos.</TE>
<TE>   Newly completed are "Transgenic Crops"--a sculpture of mutant ears
of corn--and "Esoteric Buddha in Secondary Inspection," which is a
video showing toys and dolls taken apart and coming together in new
configurations, as well as a sculpture of a composite creature
watching the video.</TE>
<TE>   Cardona presents two different sets of photographs to show his
version of the border story. One set, in glowing color, shows the
clean and orderly employees and interiors of the offices and factory
floors of several maquiladoras.  Here, suited businessmen gather and
give a comradely smile for a group photo; there, women workers tend
their assembly work. Indeed, Cardona was allowed in because he was
hired to do commercial photography for the companies.</TE>
<TE>   Says Rapp, "The story is that he would take a picture and quickly
turn and take an unofficial photograph, and [these are] the result of
that."</TE>
<TE>   The other set, in gritty black-and-white, shows the ongoing search
for some of the 260 women who have disappeared from Juarez, Mexico,
just across the border from El Paso, Texas, since 1993. Some worked
for the maquiladoras, and conspiracy theories abound, says Rapp--for
example, that the local police may be involved or that some Texan is
sneaking across the border to kill these women.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear from the two sets of photographs, however, is the
contrast between the spick-and-span workplace and the lives of the
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The black-and-white shots document the ramshackle housing that the
workers return to at night, and the grieving friends and relatives of
the missing. One shows a woman walking the desert in search of her
daughter's body and carrying a 11/2-liter bottle of water for her
day's trek; another is a close-up of half a dozen grieving women, the
sisters and friends of another missing woman, Sagrario Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Venegas' photographs, by contrast, focus on the domestic lives of
affluent Latinos who live in Tijuana and San Diego--it's a cushy
float through New Year's celebrations, birthday parties,
white-carpeted houses and children's rooms stocked with toys.</TE>
<TE>   While the subjects are respectfully treated, Rapp senses "an
ambivalence" in these pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Venegas, reached by phone in San Diego on her way to Tijuana,
confirms this. Born in Long Beach, she grew up in Tijuana, then moved
to New York City in 1998 to study photography at the International
Center of Photography. She returns to the San Diego-Tijuana border
area two or three times a year to visit and take pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "The title of my series 'The Most Beautiful Brides of Baja,
California,'" she explains, "is taken from the words at the entrance
of my father's studio--'through this door come the most beautiful
brides of Baja.'" Venegas' father is a noted professional wedding
photographer.</TE>
<TE>   She says the series is a reaction to her father's commercial work.
"I'm trying to challenge it somehow," she adds.</TE>
<TE>   "The image he used to give us was always based on what other
people thought, very superficial--he wanted to pretend that life was
like his pictures. He was selling the perfect moment of a
marriage--the wedding day."</TE>
<TE>   Venegas doesn't have any wedding photos among the two dozen
displayed at UC Riverside, but many are celebratory. In one of a
lively dinner party, svelte young women are dressed in strapless
gowns and handsome young men suited up in fashionable black, with
everyone chatting up someone else. In "Briana and Barbie" a Tijuana
youngster shows off her blond, blue-eyed Barbie, proudly holding it
up against her shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trained to become Barbie," Venegas says. "Yes, yes
especially the girls in Tijuana--we're very close to the United
States and our models are American models. There's this thing where
all the girls have long glossy hair and some of them even make their
hair blond."</TE>
<TE>   She admits she has her own fascination for this sleek,
put-together look the women in her photographs have.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the soap opera look," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Then adds quickly, "Of course, I don't want to live it!"</TE>

<HD>Breaking Out of Bollywood</HD>
<DH>The epic 'Lagaan' mixes staples of Indian film with new
elements. The payoff: an Oscar nomination.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Ashutosh Gowariker has spent his entire career in Bollywood,
India's thriving movie industry that produces hundreds of films a
year, mainly lavish melodramatic spectacles filled with action,
costumes, song and dance. But when he worked on his new movie, he had
something different in mind: a film that would be non-formulaic yet
still had significant commercial appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The result, "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India" has succeeded on
both fronts: It's been acclaimed by critics, fared well at the box
office, and, with its themes of oppression, unity and triumph, was
considered unlike anything seen before by Indian audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's up for an Oscar.</LD>
<TE>   "Lagaan" is one of only three films from India ever to be
nominated for best foreign-language film--and the only true Bollywood
film chosen. The other two were more art-house fare: "Mother India"
(1957) and "Salaam Bombay!" (1988). "Lagaan's" lead actor, Aamir
Khan, noted that getting an Oscar nomination was "an uphill task.
Most members [of the nominating committee] had never even heard of
it."</TE>
<TE>   But now that the film has made it this far and is in the running
alongside France's "Amelie," Norway's "Elling," Bosnia's "No Man's
Land" and Argentina's "Son of the Bride," Gowariker--who directed and
wrote "Lagaan"--feels vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he began with the most nebulous of ideas: wanting to
tell a story about "people getting together to achieve a common goal,
to fight oppression. I wanted a story of reunification." He wanted it
to be "bloodless," unlike the often violent scenes prevalent in
Bollywood films. Instead of one hero--again, the case in most films
from India--there had to be a group of heroes and victors. It had to
be accurate and believable, so much so that the actors speak in the
central Indian dialect native to the area in which the movie was set.</TE>
<TE>   It was originally to have been set in contemporary times, before
Gowariker realized that such a story "would have been filled with
jaded characters, politicians and policemen." So he then tried
shifting the time line back to 1947, when the British colonial rulers
were, he says, "the biggest oppressors." But staging the film in that
era would have brought with it other challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult to get away from the freedom movement, but it
would have been irresponsible of me to set a movie in 1947 and not
feature the freedom movement," he said recently over a cup of masala
chai at an Indian restaurant in Beverly Hills. "Instead, I wanted
those emotions [of oppression] to be simmering."</TE>
<TE>   So he ended up in 1893, when Indians "believed that colonial rule
would go on for another hundred years, Gowariker said. "The British
collected taxes [lagaan means 'tax' in Hindi], which were shared with
the maharajahs of each province."</TE>
<TE>   And, while overseeing the Indians, they spent their idle hours
playing polo, croquet and cricket.</TE>
<TE>   Which is where Gowariker's story comes in. The people of a small
rural village in the most arid parts of central India can barely
afford to pay their taxes--in the form of wheat and grains--when the
British impose even greater levies.</TE>
<TE>   The unsympathetic head of the regiment, Capt. Russell (played by
Paul Blackthorne) cavalierly dares the farmers to beat the English
team in a game of cricket. If they win, all taxes for the next three
years will be wiped out. If they lose, they pay triple. Bhuvan,
played by Khan, is the young de facto leader of the villagers and is
alone in his decision to accept the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is an unusual one for Bollywood, which prefers
cop-versus-bad guy dramas and straight Hollywood rip-offs. But other
elements are pure Bollywood--the length (a whopping three hours and
42 minutes) and the numerous song-and-dance sequences peppered
throughout the movie. Gowariker believes that American audiences will
embrace the film despite its length and genre-mixing style. (The film
opens May 10 in Los Angeles and New York.)</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any reason why the U.S. should not accept mainstream
Indian cinema for what it is, usually three hours long or more,"
Gowariker says. "And it's always going to be a musical. That's just
the way it is, and we're proud of it. Indian movies must be realized
in all their splendor."</TE>
<TE>   Observers say the film could help pave the way for future
Bollywood productions reaching the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a wonderful introduction of Bollywood to mainstream
audiences, although Bollywood films are typically more flashy," said
Michigan-based entertainment consultant Vipul Gupta, who described
the film as "an epic story in the vein of 'Gandhi.' It is a universal
story."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly "Lagaan" is a mixed bag of genres--romance, action,
musical, a comedy of sorts--all set in a period piece. But Gowariker,
who has also acted in numerous Indian productions since 1984, said
the time was right for such non-formulaic fare.</TE>
<TE>   "I was tired of the films that were being thrown at me," he said.
"It was so exciting for me to write this and to make it, and I had a
sense that audiences would appreciate it. I would have been
heartbroken if they hadn't." The film cost about $6 million, more
than double the budget for most Bollywood films. It has grossed about
$14 million so far in India and about $20 million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it could be a crossover film, one that showed simplistic
morals and the triumph of the human spirit. These are universal
things. Wherever there has been oppression, this could appeal,"
Gowariker said.</TE>
<TE>   The sentiment of unity was driven home by other factors. The film
shows Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, all of whom have had
fractious periods in India's history, coming together to try to beat
the British at their own game. The motley team assembled by Bhuvan
even includes a harijan, one of the country's "untouchables."</TE>
<TE>   When the movie opened in India last summer, critics raved. Pritish
Nandy, writing in India's Mid-Day newspaper, called "Lagaan" an
"amazing movie" with "flawless teamwork ... a work that will go down
in the annals of cinematic history." Amitabh Bachchan, a screen
veteran on the subcontinent, wrote a piece for the Times of India
calling "Lagaan" "a totally perfect film."</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar nomination has meant global viewership. Since the
nominations were announced, the film has been picked up by
distributors in Venezuela, Zambia and Taiwan, countries that don't
usually screen Hindi-language films.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a movie that doesn't just represent India, but also Indian
culture," Gowariker said. "That is the most fulfilling part."</TE>

<HD>A Late Starter Catches Up</HD>
<DH>As a disappointed actor, 'Gosford Park's' Julian Fellowes
didn't expect to succeed as a writer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES DENNIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How's this for a story pitch? A bald and avuncular character actor
turning 50 comes to the painful conclusion that life has no marvelous
surprises in store for him. The actor, a child of an "imperial
family" who's done a bit of writing on the side, will continue to
play upper-class snobs on British TV series with the occasional bit
in James Bond movies when toffs and/or twits are required.</LD>
<LD>   The actor is living out his days as an obscure, parochial player
on the telly, until he gets a call from a celebrated American
filmmaker, who asks the actor to write a screenplay for him. The
actor's upper-class background makes him a natural to write a
murder-mystery set in a stately English home in the 1930s. The actor
writes the screenplay--the first one he's ever had filmed--and gets
nominated for an Academy Award.</LD>
<TE>   It sounds like the kind of movie Frank Capra might have made--and
certainly not the kind made by Robert Altman, who in fact did direct
the film written by British actor Julian Fellowes: "Gosford Park."
The story does seem to be heading to a Capra-esque ending: The
screenplay has won the Writers Guild Award for best original
screenplay as well as awards from many critics' groups. Curiously, or
perversely, in a stroke the cynical Altman himself would approve of,
Fellowes did not win either of the two BAFTA Awards (from the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts, the British equivalent of the
Oscars) for which he was nominated.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd win one of them, and I didn't win either," Fellowes
recollected as he sat poolside in Los Angeles, having lunch in his
blue blazer and khaki slacks the day after winning the WGA Award
earlier this month. "It was a bit depressing. Although I did hear a
wonderful thing from one of the judges afterwards. Nice woman. She
came up and said, 'I suppose you're a bit disappointed.' I said, 'I
am a bit, really, but we go on.' And she said, 'We felt you had such
success with this film, you didn't need our recognition.' I said, 'I
think you have to be English to get that, really.'</TE>
<TE>   "Extraordinary. The English don't reward success. They reward
aspiration but not success."</TE>
<TE>   Fellowes was born in the Anglo-American Hospital on the banks of
the Nile in Egypt in 1949. His father was with the British Embassy
and the third generation of empire-building Felloweses not to be born
in England. Julian returned with his family to England when he was 2.</TE>
<TE>   "The Labor government passed a law in 1948 which said if you're
not born in England and your father's not born in England, you're not
English. Your mother didn't figure then. Incredibly, the mother was
not a factor until the reign of Mrs. Thatcher. Isn't that
extraordinary? My father was frightfully vague and never did anything
about my passport.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 11, my father was posted to Africa and we had to fly
out there for school. When I applied for my passport, they said, 'Oh,
no, you must apply to the Egyptian Embassy. This child is Egyptian.'
In the end, it was sorted out by pulling some strings. I thought,
what do people do who have no strings to pull in those situations?"</TE>
<TE>   It was this deep knowledge of the people who pull strings that led
Altman to hire Fellowes to write "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   "Julian's most responsible for this film happening," Altman said
by phone from his New York office. "He knew what fork to eat with and
what side of the cup to throw up on. We had a butler, a housemaid and
a cook in their 80s who'd actually been in service at the time [the
'30s]. But Julian was our main guru."</TE>
<TE>   "Not everyone can point to a single person and say, 'That person
changed my life,'" Fellowes says. "Robert Altman has changed my life.
He did it by taking a chance on someone when every instinct must have
been telling him to find someone more experienced."</TE>
<TE>   Fellowes attended Webber Douglas Drama School in London after
three years at Cambridge. He was heeding advice from his father, who
told him: "You have the misfortune to be born into a generation which
must earn its own living; you might as well do something amusing."
But his father stopped his son's allowance after drama school.
Fortunately, Fellowes found steady work as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "My big complaint about acting is you're underused all the time,"
Fellowes says. "You're working flat out perhaps four months of the
year, and so many of the parts don't require anything. When I was in
my early 20s at drama school, I wrote three bodice-rippers that were
published. After that, I wrote the odd magazine article. Literary
reviews. It was always somewhere in my life. The great thing about
writing is that you are used, you are stretched."</TE>
<TE>   Fellowes had been working steadily, but not happily, on stage in
London's West End from 1974 to 1980. "It wasn't me," Fellowes says.
"I felt I was leading someone else's life." At the same time, his
mother died after a lengthy bout with cancer. The combination of his
unfulfilling theater work and his mother's death led him to take a
job in the U.S., which eventually brought him to Hollywood, where he
spent 21/2 years playing such unsatisfactory roles as the chauffeur
in "The Rita Hayworth Story" on TV. I kept coming out from under the
staircase saying, 'Don't worry, Princess, all will be well.'"</TE>
<TE>   So Fellowes returned to London, where he met and married Emma
Kitchener ("the last of the Kitcheners" he jokes, referring to her
ancestor, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum). The couple has an 11-year-old
son. Six years ago, actor-producer Bob Balaban's father, who had long
been a movie exhibitor in Chicago, suggested his son make a movie
from Anthony Trollope's novel "Eustace Diamonds." Someone recommended
Fellowes do the adaptation. (That project remains on hold, Balaban
says.)</TE>
<TE>   "Julian saw through the facades of those fusty novels and made
them alive, pulsating and fresh," Balaban says. Without hesitation,
he recommended that Fellowes write "Gosford Park," an idea Balaban
and Altman had concocted.</TE>
<TE>   "My brief was that Robert Altman wanted to make a British film,"
Fellowes says. "He thought it would be fun to set it in an English
house party in the '30s, in a house where there was still a certain
class thing going on. The film would pay homage to a kind of Agatha
Christie genre. But that's not what it would be about. What it would
be about is an examination of certain master inter-class
relationships and be sort of servant-led. And we quite early on came
up with this device that you never saw the upstairs people unless
there was a servant in the room--which a lot of people don't notice,
but anyway it's there.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it was up to me to come up with whoever, whatever I wanted
in the way of the characters and story. And I remembered this scandal
I heard my aunt talking about when I was a child. There was a chap
called William Whiteley. He was a great multimillionaire, and he used
his female employees much as McCordle [the head of the house played
by Michael Gambon] does in the film. And in the end, there was this
great moment when they came to him and said there was a young man
waiting for him downstairs. He went down and the chap said, 'I am
your son,' and shot him.</TE>
<TE>   "Working from that, there were lots of things I wanted to say
about those people. For instance, there are three types of imperfect
marriage among the upper classes: one is the woman who marries a man
who is totally offensive to her but has so much money that she can
live in a way that only her grandmother lived; the other is the woman
who makes an absolutely acceptable class-equal marriage but is bored
to sobs; and the third is the one who marries for love but runs the
risk of not being able to live in the way that is expected of her.
And the three sisters represent all three marriages. And in that
fictional family on the screen, just as in many nonfictional families
on Earth, the one that is represented as the failure is the one
happily married to a man who can't make money.</TE>
<TE>   "And there are other themes that fascinate me," Fellowes
continues. "One of them is the upper classes' rejection of popular
culture. I've grown up with that all my life and, having gone into
theater and films, I can talk with moderately successful bankers
who've made no mark in the world at all and who look down on me from
a thousand feet--it doesn't matter that I'm up for an Oscar, it is
nothing to them. What I heard last week from one of my relatives:
'Very good luck with your play!'"</TE>
<TE>   "Julian's from a different zone," says actress Emily Watson, who
plays the sexy maid Elsie in "Gosford Park." "Bob Altman wanted Derek
Jacobi [who plays a servant] to iron one of the guests' newspapers in
the afternoon. Julian said no, only in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Fellowes said that despite his reputation for improvisation,
Altman stayed very close to the script when shooting "Gosford Park."
"Because Bob was so determined to make a very specific, accurate
picture about this very arcane group, there was very little
improvisation."</TE>
<TE>   "The way those people talk is so specific, and you could hear it
the minute the actors left the page. They sounded modern and
middle-class and the vocabulary is so different. Maggie Smith did
improvise one line which really makes me laugh: 'Very difficult
color, green.' That was completely Maggie.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, that was the great privilege of being there to protect
the narrative. By his own admission, Bob doesn't care about
narrative. He said the film's not a whodunit; it's a
who-cares-whodunit."</TE>
<TE>   While he talks, Fellowes stares in fascination at the bathers
around the hotel pool like the transplanted Englishman of Evelyn
Waugh's great satire of Los Angeles, "The Loved One." He reflects on
being a middle-aged overnight success story with both a sense of
wonder and detachment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 52 years old," Fellowes says. "I wrote some TV scripts and
I've written God knows enough unmade film scripts, but this is the
first script for a film that got made. I'm an Oscar nominee no matter
what happens. And I think an enormous amount of people who think it's
never going to happen are very encouraged by the fact that here is a
guy to whom it happened at an age when most people have given up and
assume it's never going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinary to be part of these ceremonies that you're
used to flicking through in crumpled magazines in the dentist's
office. And suddenly you're there and everyone's saying: 'Julian,
Julian, look this way.' Not, of course, if Halle Berry's coming up
the carpet behind you.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one of the Brits who hates Hollywood," he continues.
"I've always had a very good time here. I think the British
establishment's tendency to patronize the film industry has been
their downfall. Someone the other day said, 'You can tell the stage
players at the awards because they walk up the stairs properly. Film
people find it so hard if they haven't got marks.'</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, come on! Wake up! They are the ones people dream of now. They
are the ones who engage the public's imagination. If you want to make
the public change their mind about something, make a film about it.
Don't waste your time on a play!"</TE>

<HD>Moving House-- in a Big Way</HD>
<DH>Mounting the ceremony for the first time in its permanent
home at the Kodak Theatre has required feats of logistics by the
producers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laura Ziskin, producer of tonight's telecast of the 74th Academy
Awards, has an Oscar in her office. Not one of the gold statuettes to
be handed out for best whatever and best supporting whatever, at this
evening's ceremony--but one of the 71/2-foot, gold-painted Oscar
statues that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences deploys
around town at special events throughout Oscar season.</LD>
<LD>   This Oscar, tucked in a corner at Laura Ziskin Productions on the
Sony Studios lot in Culver City, has been dressed up in a curly black
wig, lilac-tinted sunglasses and a furry pink boa roughly the texture
of a bathroom rug. From the neck down, Oscar does the traditional
full Monty.</LD>
<LD>   Much like Ziskin's Oscar statue, the Academy Awards are getting a
new look this year. Not only does the telecast have in Ziskin a new
producer, but the show will be presented for the first time in its
new location: Hollywood's Kodak Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   The venue, which opened its doors to the public in November, is
the centerpiece of the new $615-million, 640,000-square-foot
shopping, business and entertainment complex at the corner of
Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. It's just down the street
from the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where the first Oscar ceremony
took place in 1929. The Oscars have not taken place in a Hollywood
location since 1960, when the awards were presented at the Pantages
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   After 73 years, the Academy Awards are finally getting a permanent
home; the academy has agreed to lease the Kodak annually for the
Oscars for the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The 3,500-seat Kodak Theatre, designed by architect David
Rockwell, was conceived with a nod to old Hollywood glamour. So was
the complex that houses it, designed by Ehrenkrantz Eckstut &amp; Kuhn
Architects. Some architecture critics, taking note of such features
as the faux Babylonian portal in the complex's central Babylon Court,
flanked by two columns topped with enormous elephants, have preferred
the term "kitsch."</TE>
<TE>   The outsized, retro glamour of the venue partly inspired Ziskin's
plan to create a show that makes the most of moviemaking talent--not
just as nominees, but also as creative participants in producing the
Oscar program. Filmmakers are either creating new footage or editing
compilations, and some screenwriters have been asked to contribute
written material. Costume designer Ann Roth and production designer
J. Michael Riva are both movie veterans (Riva holds the sterling
glamour credential of being the grandson of Marlene Dietrich).</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to the Kodak many times; I was first taken there when
it was still under construction, and it looked amazing to me," Ziskin
said in a recent conversation at her office. This year, instead of
being located in the academy's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard in
Beverly Hills, the awards show production offices set up shop at Sony
so Ziskin could divide her time between academy duties and
post-production work on the soon-to-be-released movie "Spider-Man."
Between the two projects, she's been sleepless at Sony. "I walk out
of my door and turn left, I go into the cutting room. I turn right,
go to the academy offices," Ziskin joked.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the location and I was thrilled by the idea of being
right on Hollywood Boulevard--but daunted by it," Ziskin said. "I
thought, well, we'll get to rehearse the closing of the streets,
bringing the cars in, but that's not the case. The rehearsal is the
day, there's no dry run. There has been a tremendous amount of
planning, but one feels that even with all the planning in the world,
you don't know what's going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Any theater has limitations, and I'm sure this one does too, but
you design around it. It's an absolutely beautiful house," Ziskin
added. "It's very conducive to making people feel like they're going
into an old-time movie house, to create the feeling of what it is
like to sit in the dark and watch a movie. I really think you cannot
overstate the potency of the movie as both an artistic and cultural
phenomenon. That, at the end of the day, is the thing we are
saluting."</TE>
<TE>   Louis J. Horvitz, director of the telecast for the past six years,
said that working in any new venue presents its own set of
circumstances. "The Kodak Theatre is designed like a European opera
house: The seating is less horizontal and more vertical," he said.
"The challenge will be to photograph this house with an aspect ratio
that runs up and down, rather than horizontally. As our medium of
film and television is more conducive to a 16-by-9 aspect ratio, the
photography at the Kodak will be challenging, to say the very least."</TE>
<TE>   The director is asking the cast to hit its marks early this year.
"The theater is also located in a very busy part of Hollywood.... I
am strongly suggesting that people leave earlier than normal to allow
for the newness of the facility, security, and the fact that they
will all be featured in an opening sequence," Horvitz said. "All in
all, the new Kodak Theatre will be a tiger by the tail that I intend
to ride and tame with the assistance of an army of the best
professionals in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Comedy writer Bruce Vilanch, now in his 13th year as head writer
for the telecast and a semi-regular celebrity guest on "Hollywood
Squares," said he expects the show to look a little different now
that it has moved into a Hollywood square of its own. "There's always
a difference between when you rent and when you own," Vilanch said.
"It's the new place, the new permanent home, so of course it's going
to become a permanent cast member of the show--that's worth some kind
of comment. We're going to be showing off the theater a lot, shooting
in different parts of the theater, so that will be different.</TE>
<TE>   "Will there be ... Kodak moments? On the corporate plug level,
no," he continued. "But just the fact that it is a new place, and
it's gotten so much press because it's where the Oscars are going to
be, we're going to show it off."</TE>
<TE>   Academy executive administrator Ric Robertson, a 20-year academy
veteran responsible for the technical nuts and bolts of readying the
theater, said bringing the Academy Awards to the new location posed
more logistical problems than either the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion or
the Shrine Auditorium, which have alternated as home to the awards
show since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more difficult, because it's a denser, urban
neighborhood," Robertson said in a recent interview in front of the
new complex, near the bleachers for 400 fans going up alongside the
complex's grand entrance, near Grauman's Chinese Theatre and just
across the street from the historic El Capitan.</TE>
<TE>   For months, rumors swirled that the academy would ban the
bleachers because of traffic and security concerns. The bleachers
will exist, but this year, instead of camping out at the site, fans
will get bleacher seats by reservation only. They'll have to fill out
applications, submit to background checks and metal detectors, and
wear ID badges. Without offering details, Robertson said that
security, always tight at the Oscars, will be tighter than ever at
the first awards show held post-Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Behind Robertson is the "red carpet" area where the stars will
enter; storefronts and the theater signage will be covered the day of
the ceremony to avoid unintentional free advertising for the Gap,
Victoria's Secret, Tommy Hilfiger or Kodak. All businesses in the
mall will be closed Oscar day. MTA subways will also bypass the
Hollywood-Highland station until Monday morning. Hollywood Boulevard
between Highland Avenue and Orange Drive has been closed since
Tuesday, and other street closures in the area have been in effect in
the past few days as well.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Shrine, all this happens in a parking lot--there are no
street closures, no issues with neighbors or business owners or
inconveniencing a major thoroughfare," Robertson said. "Here, we are
in the middle of a major retail center too. It's different.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see the movie 'Vanilla Sky'? There's a shot in it of Tom
Cruise in Times Square, and it's empty," Robertson added. "I saw a
picture of the shot, and I thought it was digital, but they actually
did it, early in the morning. It's amazing--no people. If they can do
that, then we can do this."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just a question of moving into a new home. Although the
theater is a multipurpose auditorium, it was designed with the awards
telecast in mind. The complex's Art Deco Grand Ballroom, designed by
the firm of Dianna Wong Architecture &amp; Interior Design, was created
with the annual Oscar after-party, the Governors Ball, in mind. This
year's party has 1,600 expected guests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like they built the whole structure to suit us, but we
did have input," Robertson said. "It feels like we've been working on
this show for four years."</TE>
<TE>   It was indeed that many years ago that talks began between
TrizecHahn, the Canadian developer responsible for the Hollywood &amp;
Highland project, and Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy,
about creating some sort of academy presence at the new development,
which is part of a master plan to revitalize the heart of Hollywood
that first took shape in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the idea was a modest plan to include a motion picture
museum in the complex. But for years, the academy has fought for
rehearsal time amid other commitments at the Shrine and the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. "So Bruce [Davis] said, half-joking, 'We'd like
you to build us a theater.' The idea began to generate steam and
that's how it began," Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that the theater would, if not be built for just us,
make us one of the real anchor tenants, was real appealing. So we
began working with their architects, designers and lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Now seated in the high-ceilinged theater, which features three
balconies and boxes along the sides, Roberston pointed proudly to the
"media cockpit" in the middle of the room. "In the center of the
theater [during an Oscar telecast] there is always a main camera, a
TelePrompTer, often a camera on a jib and other kinds of equipment.
At our other venues, that knocked out dozens of seats. Here, the
cockpit is low enough so people can see over it. Hopefully, every
seat will be a good seat."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson also noted that the theater, as well as its labyrinth of
backstage corridors, is equipped with an overhead network of
ladder-like grids for laying the cable necessary to link the theater
with the TV production trucks parked next to the complex in the
Orange Motor Court, ordinarily used to accommodate tour buses. The
cable also serves as a link to the vehicles serving the many media
outlets covering the awards. They will be parked across the street in
a lot behind the El Capitan. At the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the
Shrine, all that cable was awkwardly strung in visible locations, or
sometimes taped to the floor--a disaster waiting to happen, should a
Manolo Blahnik heel run afoul of that cable.</TE>
<TE>   Although the theater suits the needs of the academy telecast,
critics have panned it for that very reason, saying the Kodak has the
look and feel of a TV studio rather than a theater. The acoustics,
they observe, are ready for prime time, but not much else.</TE>
<TE>   The Kodak Theatre opened in November with a concert featuring the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and popular tenor Russell Watson. Wrote
Richard S. Ginell in Daily Variety, "One is reminded that the last
few generations have grown up with nothing but amplified music in
their ears--and this hall is made for them and only them." Times
music critic Mark Swed called the Kodak "an auditorium for a
statuette with a blind eye and a tin ear."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson seems unfazed by the reviews. "I don't know of any new
theater that doesn't need some tuning," he said cheerfully. "You can
bet that our conductor, John Williams [composer of film scores for
"Star Wars" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," among
others] is going to make sure his part of it sounds great."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson also conceded that some members of the surrounding
business and residential districts did not immediately thank the
academy upon learning of the traffic disruptions and business
closures the ceremony would entail. The City Council suggested that
academy representatives hold community meetings to defuse the
tension.</TE>
<TE>   "About two weeks ago, we had a meeting at the Egyptian Theatre
down the street, and there was an amazing turnout--300-plus people,"
Robertson said. "There were people that were still working on rumors,
that we were closing down Hollywood Boulevard for two weeks, no one
would be able to get through to their jobs and so on. We were able to
quell some of this. It's going to be an inconvenience for people, but
the publicity that the Academy Awards is going to bring into the area
is hard to overlook.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the idea of saying to people: 'Can't you see that
we're making a movie here?' We want to coexist and try to accommodate
as much as we can. But this is a big show."</TE>
<TE>   From an onstage perspective, the last couple of years of Oscar
have already wrought some changes. For the 72nd awards show in 2000,
first-time producers Richard D. Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck vowed to
tighten the show by eliminating the dance numbers. Gil Cates,
producer of 10 of the last 12 Academy Awards telecasts, maintained
the dance ban for the 73rd installment when he returned to the job
last year. Ziskin will do the same--eliminating any fear that viewers
might be forced to witness what happens when "The Lord of the Rings"
meets Lord of the Dance.</TE>
<TE>   Ziskin has replaced dancing with flying; she has engineered the
first Academy Awards show appearance of Cirque du Soleil. The
Canadian acrobatic ensemble will perform a live four-minute act, the
details of which remain a closely guarded secret. Debra Brown,
director and choreographer of the segment, would say only that the
performance is a tribute to cinema. Brown said the piece was
rehearsed at a Cirque theater in Orlando, Fla., and moved in for
rehearsal at the Kodak on Thursday. "We'll have to adapt--but most of
the artists are used to adapting to television galas or adapting to
different stages. But this is the first time we're doing it with so
many artists."</TE>
<TE>   But, Ziskin said that in any location, the venerable Oscar
telecast "defies reinvention."</TE>
<TE>   "I think what it is is a good thing," said Ziskin, whose credits
include executive producer of "As Good as It Gets" and "Pretty
Woman." She got a taste of live TV producing when she shared credit
as executive producer with George Clooney and Pam Williams for the
live CBS presentation of "Fail Safe" in 2000. "But like producing
anything, it's about the talent you bring to the endeavor, so I've
chosen to pull in filmmaking talent, even though we're producing a TV
show."</TE>
<TE>   Vilanch, who will camp out in the wings with members of his
writing staff to write and rewrite material for host Whoopi Goldberg
and others as the show progresses, said that ultimately it's the
movies, not the venue, that dictate the character of each year's
awards show. "The movies lend themselves to so much--I mean,
schizophrenia is always rewarded in Hollywood, but this year I think
it's going to be getting more awards than usual," he said. "The
movies are what dictate the material, and when you are handed the
Moulin Rouge and Middle-earth and dysfunctional families, it's pretty
tasty."</TE>

<DH>The nominated cinematographers may differ about how to get
the look they want. But they all set out with one goal: to capture a
memorable sense of place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The original idea was to gather all five Oscar-nominated
cinematographers in one room to talk about the art and craft of
shooting movies. But in today's global filmmaking reality, a
conference call linking four countries had to suffice.</LD>
<LD>   Bruno Delbonnel checked in from Paris, the city he so charmingly
mythologized in "Amelie." "Black Hawk Down's" director of
photography, Slawomir Idziak, spoke from Warsaw. "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" cinematographer Andrew Lesnie
called from his home in Sydney. British-born Roger Deakins, director
of photography for "The Man Who Wasn't There," and Australian native
Donald M. McAlpine, nominated for his work in "Moulin Rouge,"
gathered around a speaker phone in a Beverly Hills hotel suite.</LD>
<LD>   Delbonnel, working for the first time with his close friend
"Amelie" director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, drew inspiration from French
Impressionist painter Pierre Bonnard and scouted Paris for three
months to find the 80 locations featured in the film.</LD>
<TE>   Deakins, who also shot leading Oscar contender "A Beautiful Mind,"
has made six movies with "The Man Who Wasn't There" filmmaking team
of Joel and Ethan Coen. Deakins and the Coen brothers, shooting in
Pasadena and Orange, filmed in color before printing the images in
black and white. McAlpine contributed to Australia's independent film
movement with such breakthrough efforts as "My Brilliant Career"
(1979) and "Breaker Morant" (1980). He teamed for the first time with
Baz Luhrmann on "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" and spent a
year in pre-production re-creating fin-de-siecle Paris on three
Australian sound stages.</TE>
<TE>   Lesnie, best known for shooting "Babe" in 1995, helped create a
complex "Lord of the Rings" color scheme, defining each realm of
Middle-earth with a distinct set palette. The "Rings" trilogy, filmed
in New Zealand, marks Lesnie's first collaboration with director
Peter Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Idziak worked closely with the late Polish director Krzysztof
Kieslowski on films such as "The Double Life of Veronique" (1991).
Ridley Scott hired Idziak on the strength of "Veronique" as well as
"Gattica" (1995) and "I Want You" (1998). For "Black Hawk Down," set
in Mogadishu, Somalia, but filmed in Morocco, Idziak coordinated as
many as seven cameras shooting simultaneously for lengthy combat
sequences. It's his first film with Scott.</TE>
<TE>   As they voiced their views in an 80-minute discussion excerpted
below, a fundamental bond emerged: To trot out that most familiar of
filmmaking truisms, these master craftsmen thrive on collaboration.
Given the chance in the nominated work to participate as artists,
Deakins, Delbonnel, McAlpine, Idziak and Lesnie responded with moving
images of the first order.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Each of these five films conjures such a vivid sense of
place. How did you go about creating this kind of heightened reality,
where the setting itself becomes a major character in the story?</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: Well, that was the way Joel and Ethan had written it, as
a black-and-white film. Obviously, "The Man Who Wasn't There" was an
hommage to film noir, but also an hommage to '40s science-fiction
movies and B-movies, so there was a lot of different imagery that was
conjured up just by reading the script. You spend time in
pre-production, just generally talking about the ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Putting that noir twist into this middle-class environment,
throwing two unexpected things together ...</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: They've generally done that with all their films. That's
what's so great about Joel and Ethan's filmmaking. They often examine
small lives, small-town America.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Bruno, how did you create this particular vision of Paris in
"Amelie"?</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: The idea was to create a kind of fairy tale look, so
the major thing for us was to make Paris look beautiful, which was
kind of difficult because Paris is not anymore beautiful for us. It's
a very weird city now and very ugly. We had to find those really
remote locations in Paris that only Parisians know about, which are
places the camera likes. The lens makes it beautiful because they're
already beautiful. And then choosing a wide lens as we did, we wanted
to show those buildings which are kind of special to this place,
Montmartre.</TE>
<TE>   Idziak: I must say, filming "Black Hawk Down" was a very easy task
with Ridley as the director. Having a partner who had a complete and
clear vision of the picture, I had only to fulfill his vision. We had
a little bit of fighting, but I was completely free in terms of the
color scheme, how to proceed in terms of filtering, the vision in
terms of lighting and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The word "dust" comes to mind when I think of "Black Hawk
Down." I wonder if your choice of color brought out that sense of
dryness even more?</TE>
<TE>   Idziak: The color decision--I'm just joking of course--but very
often Ridley used to mention that he was making this
public-is-about-to-vomit sort of picture. So I just tried to find my
inspiration for the colors in the color of vomiting. [Laughter.]
That's why I use so much yellow and all this.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Andrew, I read somewhere that tourism in New Zealand has
increased 20% since "Lord of the Rings" was released. Tell me about
the sense of place you and Peter Jackson set out to create.</TE>
<TE>   Lesnie: We took the view that Middle-earth was a prehistory of the
planet. Photographically, that translated into not wanting to make
the movie feel too much like a straight-out fantasy, that the story
wasn't set on another planet, but that it was definitely set on Earth
and that we had just backed up in time. And in terms of mythology, we
wanted to appeal to that primal sense among people that they may have
visited these environments sometime in their past or in a past life
even. New Zealand is an extraordinarily beautiful country. For its
size, it has an amazing number of dramatic landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Donald?</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine: The basic concept for "Moulin Rouge" was that it was the
equivalent of a New York 1980s nightclub set in turn-of-the-century
Paris. The big attraction [for the working girls] was to attach
yourself to some gentleman of wealth and substance, and the place you
could do that, apparently, was the Moulin Rouge. So it was basically
a massive pickup joint, with an underlying core of prostitution and,
to a minor degree, some drugs. So it was a pretty rough old town.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that was a layer having to do with Zidler, the manager
of the club, who was obsessed with electricity. At that point in
history, electricity was the equivalent, say, of television in the
'40s, where people would go to watch it in a shop front. So people
would just go to Moulin Rouge to see the wonder of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As the director of photography, how did you express all of
those elements?</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine: It was a great excuse to light up the joint. The club is
endlessly surrounded by strings and strings and strings of small
lamps. Everything's outlined in festoon lighting, and basically
that's the way we did it. It was really an effort to capture the
ethic of the time, and the way to do that was to transmit as much
visual and kinetic energy from the performers to the screen. That was
our mantra every day: Where's the energy? Look for the energy; fight
for the energy. A lot of that was simply done by often using wide
lenses and a lot of camera movement.</TE>
<TE>   Q (to all): Do you feel you have a signature style that carries
through from one project to the next, or do you think of yourself
more as a chameleon?</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: I like to think I don't have a style, but I also like to
think that if somebody saw a film that I'd shot, they'd know that it
was me that shot it. Look, for every film, it's a new script, a new
set of people. I'm never doing anything that I've done before. I hope
that every film has its own look and its own feel, but I'd like to
feel I have something I am giving that is personal--otherwise I don't
know why I'm bothering.</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: I don't think I have a style. I hope I don't, in fact,
because to have a style is to have just one way to light or
something. For "Amelie," I used digital grading, [a recently
developed process that digitally manipulates a film's color] and
maybe on the next one I'll use another kind of grading. Sometimes
directors don't have a really pristine view of what they want to
achieve, so for me it's very important to collaborate with different
people from the director to the production designer and costume
designer, and find what is the best thing to do for this script.</TE>
<TE>   Idziak: I try not to have any kind of bridge between the project
being made and the next one. I try always to find inspiration in the
script, and try to define the language, to find something new, and to
establish a completely fresh attitude.</TE>
<TE>   But, you know, something I'd like to say: I am used to working in
a system in which the cinematographer is the first person engaged. In
Eastern Europe, it's a sort of rule. So it was a surprise to me to
work in the type of production like you often have in the U.S., to be
asked to deliver some kind of vision at a moment when the set
designer is already hired, sets have all appeared, locations are
already chosen. It's something which always puzzled me.</TE>
<TE>   Very often I have a feeling that some American pictures are very
much alike. You have a feeling of a Christmas tree decoration--you
have a lot of decoration so you don't see very clearly the tree
behind them. I try to avoid that. I try to be very direct in the way
I use my camera and my lighting.</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine: Style often means superimposing some sort of visual
dogma over the whole thing, and that, I think, is ridiculous. Every
shot has to be set up so it suits that particular scene relative to
the scene before and the one afterward, and the whole movie. So the
style of the thing, I believe, comes out of all that which is inside
you all, combined with that which is laid on you.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" was a magnificent experience because for one year
prior to shooting, I was brainwashed. Baz and C.M. [production and
costume designer Catherine Martin] and the writers and the wardrobe
were all working to an increasing degree as we developed the whole
dramatic and visual concept of the movie. Every detail of that film
was planned.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sort of experience that I certainly haven't had at any
time in Hollywood, and it sort of relates back to my poverty years of
moviemaking: You spend evenings over the course of a year with a
director developing this little movie called "Breaker Morant" or "My
Brilliant Career." Then, eventually, you get some idiot to finance
it, and you go and make it. That to me was moviemaking truly from the
heart. Of course, if you're going to play this industrial game, which
is what Hollywood is, it's another game, and there's a lot of joys in
that. But they're different joys.</TE>
<TE>   Q: One more point on the question of style. In the course of
developing any kind of aesthetic, you're inevitably going to develop
likes and dislikes. Slawomir, for example, talks about "Christmas
tree decoration," and I imagine that helps define a certain
consistency in the way he likes to shoot. Could you talk about things
you try to stay away from as a cinematographer?</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine: I guess on a level we're all whores, and sometimes you
have to do things you don't like. My fundamental thing is, I feel an
obligation to the audience to get as much information up on the
screen as I can--to keep it as honest I can. With that in mind, I
very rarely use filtration. I very rarely use smoke for atmosphere.
I've avoided like the plague shooting Super 35. That's an argument I
have to have for every movie I shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetically, every rule, if you can find a rule, is designed to
be broken. On "Moulin Rouge," shooting your glamour leading lady on a
40-millimeter [distorting] lens endlessly and getting away with it
was breaking a rule that--you'd just be killed--I had a feeling
sometimes with Baz that if I were in Hollywood and these dailies came
up, I'd have been fired. In Australia, people were cheering.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Bruno?</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: Here, we are really fighting against these boring
French movies--it's the end of the French New Wave, and we are still
dealing with intellectuals from the Cahiers du Cinema and all those
kind of magazines that try to emphasize all these native intellectual
subjects. Now, with Jeunet, and very few other directors in France
and a very few cinematographers as well, we are fighting to find an
aesthetic. That means I am open to every new kind of technique, every
kind of new technology, you see?</TE>
<TE>   So when I hear Don McAlpine talking about Super 35 and that he
hates it, I say, "I love it!" I prefer to use circular lenses and
shots and Super 35, and "Amelie" was done this way and I hope it is
beautiful. I like what Don says about breaking the rules--I too think
there are no rules.</TE>
<TE>   What I saw in "Night of the Hunter" [the 1955 film starring Robert
Mitchum with cinematography by Stanley Cortez] in terms of
cinematography was amazing. It was absolutely new for its time in the
history of movies. The lighting was gorgeous and the story was great
as well, and it was the proper light for this movie. And that is what
keeps me going in fact. And I don't like the very flat light we have
in France. I think it's definitely ugly. That's it.</TE>
<TE>   Idziak: War movies are not my cup of tea, but it was a great
pleasure and honor to work with Ridley Scott on "Black Hawk Down."
The only thing that helped me to survive the picture was the fact
that Ridley had not worked on this kind of picture before either, so
somehow we both tried to open up the genre with an experimental
approach. We didn't try to look to the past.</TE>
<TE>   Lesnie: I don't have any particular technical dislikes. I think
each project attracts technology that is appropriate to it. For me,
the biggest issues are the scripts. I always ask myself: Is it an
important story? Is it worth telling? When I go to the movies, if I'm
only examining the actual technique of the movie, that means I'm
bored with the film. But if the film sucks me in, I'll generally have
to go back a second time to look at the photography. Those are the
kinds of films I want to take part in.</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: I've got many hates and dislikes, but they're
generalizations: I hate shooting little scenes with multiple cameras.
I hate blue backlight. I hate most Steadicam work. But then I still
use Steadicam on blue backlight with multiple cameras. It just
depends on the project.</TE>
<TE>   I hate most modern movies--I find them bland and uninteresting,
and I find not only the scripts bland and uninteresting but the
productions bland and uninteresting. I've been lucky. I've had
projects where I don't feel I've been forced into producing a bland
and uninteresting look. [Laughter.]</TE>
<TE>   You know, Don says we're prostitutes in a way, because it's a
business out here, but there's still great movies getting made in
Hollywood. I think it's wrong to blame Hollywood. It's just the
times--if you want me to go on the globalization kick, I will.
[Laughter.] In England, they're not particularly making great
indigenous product about British culture, and they're not doing that
in France or anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You each worked with directors who have a very precise vision
of what they want, so I'm sure you planned in advance as much as
possible what the look of the film should be. Was there still room to
be spontaneous on the set?</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: I think, contrary to opinion, the more prepared you are,
the more you can make use of those times that come along where you
say, "Well, I don't want to do it like we storyboarded it. Let's take
this direction and do something totally different." Whereas if you
have no plan and you're wandering around on the set with the actors
trying to find out what the hell the scene is about or saying, "Well,
this dialogue doesn't work," then you've got a pretty scarce chance
of making a good scene.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I love working with Joel and Ethan. They're always very
prepared. People say, "Well isn't that restricting, if everything's
storyboarded before you get to the set?" Yeah, but we all do that
together so we know what we're aiming for. Then you have this sort of
platform to build on and you can take that in any direction you want.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, you've got your gauges and your lenses and your meters and
your storyboards, but are there also internal gauges, as it were,
where you say, "This is better than what we'd planned?"</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: But that's the most important thing. You have to know the
technique of lighting, you have to know what a lens does and why you
want to use camera movement or not. But when you're on the set, it's
totally about gut feeling, about your reaction to the actor and the
way he's moving or what he's saying or what the scene's about. If you
get bogged down in the tech, you're lost--it's nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: My experience with Jeunet was the same as Roger's with
the Coen brothers. For example, when we shot "Amelie" in May, we had
20 days of rain, which is quite unusual, but because of this prep, we
were able to change a lot of things and even use the rain.
Technique--it's not the main point. You can have the most beautiful
crane movement, but it's useless because it doesn't mean anything.</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine: Some days you'll shoot exactly what was planned. For me,
those are the least rewarding days. Other days, when you go to the
set, all of a sudden something explodes. All the preparation, all the
storyboards, all your knowledge of cinema--you bring that with you,
so that when anything comes along--and the inspiration can come from
an actor, a trick of the lighting, a trick of the weather, even the
director [McAlpine laughs]--unless you can actually add something
when that happens, I think you should stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've all just spoken about the importance of preparation.
What were your points of references in preparing for these
movies--not only other films, but also painting, comic books, novels,
photographers? Also, more generally, who are the influences that
inspired you to shoot films in the first place? Roger, we'll start
with you. Before starting "The Man Who Wasn't There," I understand,
you saw a couple of noir films ["This Gun for Hire" (1942) and "The
Blue Dahlia" (1946)].</TE>
<TE>   Deakins: I do see other movies, but I don't think in those terms.
The way you visualize it in your head is something much more
personal. It might be a walk on the beach or the way the light hits
on a certain day that stimulates your imagination. You're really
bringing to the film who you are.</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: Maybe one of my main references now is the French
Impressionist painter Pierre Bonnard. There is this kind of vibration
of light. What interests me the most in his paintings is, for
example, the sensation of a bright sunny day [evoked] not through a
ray of light as in Vermeer paintings, but with a color palette: the
association of colors which anybody can feel as the sensation of a
warm, sunny day. When I was a child, I liked very much in a French
apartment when the light is hitting the end of the room--or only the
floor or only the ceiling. So for "Amelie" I tried mixing this
recollection of my childhood and the idea of this light vibrating to
create a feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Idziak: I am not the kind of person who is inspired by painting,
by other movies, other pictures--it is just the opposite for me. The
script or literature which is about the subject I'm about to film is
very interesting to me. My grandfather, my grandmother, my father, my
mother, both of my sisters, they are all photographers, and I made
the move from still photography to cinema. My father was very simple
in his profession. He never ever used a light meter because he knew
exactly how to expose his mechanism. I admire this kind of hand
worker, who achieves this level of mastery in his profession.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Andrew?</TE>
<TE>   Lesnie: One of my biggest influences when I'm on a production is
music because it seems to stimulate my visual sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In particular, for "Lord of the Rings"?</TE>
<TE>   Lesnie: I looked for classical composers because I was looking for
grand but complex music to get my mind working on the scale of the
project. I listened to Prokofiev, to Holst. The earliest films I had
an interest in was for the music as much as the photography, like "On
the Waterfront," which to this day I find to be an extremely moving
film, in no small part of the brilliant score.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there anything else that anybody here wants to address?</TE>
<TE>   Delbonnel: There is one thing that to me seems special. I don't
talk about "Amelie," but I have seen "Moulin Rouge," "The Man Who
Wasn't There," "Lord of the Rings" and "Black Hawk Down," and all
those movies are very special. And there is a point where all of us
meet, I don't know exactly where, which makes cinematography very
interesting because [these films are] really different from what we
usually see. And even with these backgrounds and different histories
and different systems even, you know, from Hollywood to Poland and
France and Australia, there is a place where we can meet, in
cinematography, and we see it in each of these movies.</TE>

<DH>Architect Jeffrey Kalban uses color and form for uplifting
ends. To him, it's his social obligation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You've seen my paintings right? So you know I like color."</LD>
<LD>   That's architect Jeffrey Kalban talking, and as any visitor who's
seen his geometric abstract canvases in his West Los Angeles office
can attest, Kalban doesn't simply like color. He adores it. The
brighter the better.</LD>
<LD>   Those who haven't seen Kalban's paintings will get a chance to
check out the wiry 55-year-old architect's visual flair via two new
projects. For the $5-million PATH Regional Homeless Center, he has
splashed canary yellow, crisp blue, lavender, orange, red and primary
green throughout the corridors of what has to be the world's most
cheerful-looking homeless center. Slated for an April 11 grand
opening, the Hollywood center incorporates 19 social service
agencies, a beauty salon, a 98-bed dormitory, showers and classrooms
in a three-story, one-stop service "mall" run by Los Angeles
nonprofit organization People Assisting the Homeless.</LD>
<TE>   The Fairfax district's new $6-million Pan Pacific Park Recreation
Center, at 7600 Beverly Blvd., features Kalban's low-slung burnt-red
building adjoined to a taller forest-green gymnasium, both banded by
slivers of white, rough-textured concrete bricks. Also set to open in
April, the complex houses two gymnasiums, classrooms and offices.</TE>
<TE>   These projects represent the latest in a series of Los
Angeles-area efforts that have earned Kalban and his 10-person firm
nearly a dozen awards in the last decade. Since his start in 1969
with I.M. Pei in New York, Kalban has applied his contemporary
aesthetic to commissions ranging from the Toyota Technical Center in
Torrance, the Curtis School in Los Angeles and the Spataru residence
in Westwood, all of which were honored by the American Institute of
Architects. Kalban's most prominent assignment: the Getty Center
South Building, completed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the wiggly walls of the Pan Pacific's west wing,
Kalban can hardly contain himself. "Look at this curve going one way,
the other curve going back the other way, the stripes, the green
walls, the straight wall, the rhythm. And then you have these palm
trees and the shadows working with the undulations of this sidewalk,
so this walk through here between the trees and undulating
walls--it's going to be a real California experience. They built it!
We drew it and they built it."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban can be forgiven his giddiness. Creating a public works
building of distinction is no easy feat, and the architect had to
navigate a tangle of agencies and community groups, each with their
own requirements. "They give you a book of specs this thick," Kalban
says, holding his fingers 2 inches apart.</TE>
<TE>   The original Pan Pacific Auditorium, built in 1935, embodied a
pared-down Depression-era variation on Art Deco known as Streamline
Moderne. Heralded by four iconic, fin-shaped towers, the versatile
venue was the site of everything from Ice Capades and boat shows to
political conventions and Elvis Presley concerts. The building was
shuttered in 1972 and burned down in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Los Angeles County and the city's Recreation and
Parks Department recruited Kalban to devise a new building. Kalban,
who had made the city's "approved list" on the strength of a striking
outdoor stage he'd designed for Warner Park in Woodland Hills, needed
to please a varied constituency.</TE>
<TE>   "We had long meetings and many of them, and Jeff was just great
the whole time," says Adinah Solomon, deputy to county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who helped shepherd the project to completion. The city,
the county, the lawyers, the neighborhood organizations, the park
advisory committee, the soccer players, basketball fans and
noise-conscious residents all sounded off. "There were times when
you'd want to yell, 'What are you talking about?' But Jeff didn't--he
just listened to whatever they had to say."</TE>
<TE>   For Kalban, it was simply business as usual. "I've been on
commercial projects where I've seen architects force preconceptions
down the throat of clients. What do you learn from that? Nothing. How
do you grow from that? So you go to community meetings and even
somebody who might be totally negative, there's a reason for it," he
says. "But if you understand why they're negative and you can solve
that problem, then all of a sudden you've got an architecture that is
unique, that's not some preconceived design that's slammed down on
the site."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban's ability to incorporate community feedback made converts
out of some neighborhood skeptics, Solomon says. "One of the
neighbors who was adamantly against the park, started crying when she
saw the designs; she says, 'This is what the park should look like.'"
Yaroslavsky, who has lived in the Fairfax neighborhood since he was
8, added, "More than 100 people who had been involved in the input
process were there when we broke ground on the park, which is
something you don't see very often. That facility really bears the
fingerprints of that neighborhood in a serious way."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban may have been receptive to suggestions, but he was no
pushover, fighting when necessary to bring his ideas to fruition.
"There were a lot of people second-guessing us as we got closer and
closer to painting the thing: 'Don't you want to make it tan?' No, we
don't want to make it tan, no way! That would have been safe and
easy."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention less costly. Because he wanted the colors to
complement each other perfectly, Kalban went through more than half a
dozen "brushings," driving to the site on his own dime to inspect the
colors. "If you have things that are a little bit out of the
ordinary, it costs you money," he says. "But we said ... it's gonna
be a green building and a red building that have the stripes on 'em
and the gray for the accents. Nobody's criticizing it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Driving east down Beverly Boulevard to the PATH project, Kalban
acknowledges that Los Angeles has not always demonstrated much
reverence for its past. In the case of the rec center, he wanted to
pay homage to the Pan Pacific legacy, most notably by fronting the
new complex with a tower that mimics the original building's
trademark "icons."</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a great building," Kalban says. "You couldn't
possibly want to do something new here without honoring it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are buildings that are worth keeping, magical places like
this place," he says, pointing to the Insomnia Cafe. Then again, a
few moments later, he passes a mundane mall. "Unfortunately things
like this pop up, these strip malls that have absolutely no sense of
restraint and how the community works."</TE>
<TE>   The PATH Center, shoehorned between a pest control company and the
101 Freeway, bears little resemblance to the dilapidated warehouse
building the nonprofit group purchased in 1999. Kalban reinforced the
columns and wall structures for seismic support, then painted the
columns red and punched holes in the support walls, more or less for
the heck of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to add a little bit of design, a little bit of whimsy
to the severity of that wall," he says. "The holes don't compromise
the structural integrity at all, but they help make it look like when
people walk by, there's something playful happening there."</TE>
<TE>   The primary color palette continues in the center's reception area
and throughout the 40,000-square-foot headquarters. "You'd be
surprised how much positive energy flows through this building
because of the colors, says Janet Ganaway, the nonprofit group's
associate director. "That's the first thing people see when they walk
in the door. It's very uplifting."</TE>
<TE>   The clinic has been processing nearly 100 people a day since
opening for partial service in January. "Word of mouth spreads really
fast," Ganaway says. "They're not going to something that's dirty,
that's dingy, that's plain, and it really sparks them and kind of
like uplifts their self-esteem when they come here."</TE>
<TE>   The group's executive director, Joel John Roberts, says he gave
Kalban "a lot of constraints and wishes--everything from the shape of
the building to the color, to the flow, security, different entrances
(for male and female residents), the campus feeling within one big
building. He came up with some amazing solutions."</TE>
<TE>   One example of Kalban's resourcefulness: Roberts wanted to promote
his organization to the 250,000 motorists who pass by on the 101
every day. The problem: State regulations prohibit new billboards
overlooking freeways. Adhering to code, Kalban solved the problem by
integrating a can't-miss-it logo into the fabric of the building.</TE>
<TE>   "They've built the Staples Center for sports, the Disney for
culture, the cathedral for religion," Roberts says. "So we told Jeff,
we're right off the freeway too; we also want to make a statement
about our city, that we've created a center for compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban's rejection of the standard institutional look in favor of
more welcoming visual cues is helping to accomplish the PATH mission,
Roberts says. "This building is about encouraging homeless people on
the street to enter our doors for the first time. You know, they're
afraid, they don't know what's going to happen when they walk into
some institutional building. Here, anyone is willing to walk in
because it's very open and bright, and like a mall."</TE>
<TE>   Results have been striking. Officials at the city Department of
Mental Health Services report that they've served more people in one
week at their office in the PATH center than they did the previous
three months with their old program.</TE>
<TE>   If Kalban's design has helped make the homeless feel at home, it's
in part because he and his staff interviewed dozens of PATH personnel
before conceiving their plan. "These PATH people get in the vans and
go out and pick up the people on the streets and bring them
back--they're passionate about helping the homeless. So how can you
not take it to heart? They have this incredible focus and dedication;
we wanted to respond to that. Yeah, maybe there's one or two places
where I question the color, where the yellow's too bright, but
basically it works."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up on Long Island, N.Y., Kalban decided to be an architect
at age 7. A couple of years later, he began poring through
architecture magazines, admiring works by Le Corbusier and Brazilian
Oscar Niemeyer. "It was the poetry in their buildings that I liked,"
he says, "their sheer romantic approach to architecture, but in a
very Modernist way."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban graduated in 1969 with a bachelor of architecture degree
from Ohio State University and went to work for Modernist master I.M.
Pei in New York. He took a year off to do sculpture, then joined his
soon-to-be-wife, Maria Pavlou, in Los Angeles in 1972. Three years
later, he joined Pereira &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the opposite of I.M. Pei in how they approached
design," Kalban recalls. "In Pei's office, this huge architectural
firm, you learn from the point of view of architecture as fine art.
There was no compromise at all, whereas Bill Pereira was very
pragmatic. He encouraged me to learn to design from the inside out:
You learn the problems of your clients, solve them and then design
the building."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban started Kalban &amp; Associates in 1982. Early on, he parlayed
small-scale commissions from Toyota--a suggestion box, a clock, a
fountain--into an ongoing relationship that has produced 14 buildings
around the country, including the $45-million Toyota Technical Center
in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Managing partner Susan Oakley, a former teacher, joined in 1993
and helped forge a niche in the private school arena. Curtis School,
St. Matthew's Parish School in Pacific Palisades, Marlborough School
in Los Angeles, Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood and the
Viewpoint School in Calabasas are among Kalban's clients.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Kalban received his most prestigious commission to date:
the Getty Center's South Building. Steve Roundtree, executive vice
president for the Getty Trust, hired Kalban to design a five-level
structure to house parking, administrative offices and maintenance
facilities. Roundtree recalls, "We had Richard Meier already in
place, but he was essentially buried by the work and deadlines to get
in place at the Getty Center at the top of the hill. So I made a
decision to bring in a different architect because essentially this
was an entirely separate problem to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the decision right from the start we didn't feel
compelled to come up with a design that looked like Richard
Meier--just the opposite," he continued. "We didn't want there to be
any confusion; everything about the building, including the
landscaping on the hill behind it, we gave that over to Jeff."</TE>
<TE>   The assignment was challenging. Museum officials had to figure out
how to put up a fairly significant building, nestle it into a little
niche hard up against the hill, get parking underneath it and be able
to move cars and equipment in and out, Roundtree said.</TE>
<TE>   Kalban also had to appease the high-powered homeowner groups from
Bel-Air and Brentwood. "We broke it into two halves, so that the
footprints of the buildings were comparable to the house size," he
says. "When we presented that to the homeowners' association, they
were very supportive."</TE>
<TE>   Roundtree, while serving as chairman of the board for the Curtis
School, later asked Kalban to design that school's campus. "I think
Jeff has a clean aesthetic with a humanistic scale," he says. "He
likes to break buildings down to a human level so that as you
approach a building, you feel comfortable with the structure rather
than being overwhelmed by it."</TE>
<TE>   Kalban lives in Sherman Oaks with his wife, a fashion designer
with her own company, Tailfeathers, and their teenage daughter. He's
content with living in a non-trendy neighborhood in the Valley and
also willing to work for relatively modest fees if he finds the
project exciting.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get the budgets that an I.M Pei gets," Kalban says. "We
don't have any commercial partners, so we don't have to worry about
making money for the firm, other than staying alive. It's just Susan
and myself and our desire to do the architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves room for clients like People Assisting the Homeless.
"If you can't do something like that at least some of the time, then
why get up in the morning?" Kalban says. "I believe very strongly
that every building has a social obligation. I don't care if it's a
private house or a corporation; you face the public every point in
its process, and you have an obligation to work in an uplifting way."</TE>

<KH>The Oscars</KH>
<HD>Remembrance of Flings Past</HD>
<DH>For a little guy, Oscar got around. Now that the awards
have a permanent home, take a look at where they've been.</DH>

<LD>Times and tastes have certainly changed. What began humbly enough as
a relaxed "family" evening with a dinner of broiled chicken on toast
has evolved into the biggest event in the film industry.</LD>
<LD>   As the Academy Awards settle into their first permanent home--the
Kodak Theatre at Hollywood &amp; Highland--it's a good opportunity to
reflect on the places the extravaganza has outgrown.</LD>
<LD>   The first event, May 16, 1929, was held in the Blossom Room at the
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Far from the tightly guarded secret they
are today, winners had been announced three months earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the 270 attendees were academy members. Guests paid $5 to
attend. Academy President Douglas Fairbanks was host along with
Chairman William C. DeMille and presented all the awards.</TE>
<TE>   For the second ceremony, April 3, 1930, the event ventured to the
Cocoanut Grove nightclub at the Ambassador Hotel. In their first
broadcast, the awards were aired for one hour on KNX radio.</TE>
<TE>   With the guest list expanding, the fourth gala moved to the more
spacious Sala D'Oro at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on
Nov. 10, 1931. Table assignments, unfortunately, weren't given out in
advance so dinner was delayed until 9 and the presentation didn't
start until midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The event returned to the Ambassador, but in the Fiesta Room, on
Nov. 18, 1932, and in a first, the evening concluded early--at 11
p.m. Another first was a best-actor tie: Wallace Beery for "The
Champ" and Fredric March for "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."</TE>
<TE>   After two years in the Fiesta Room, the Oscars trekked back
downtown to the Biltmore Bowl on Feb. 27, 1935. Nearly 1,000 guests
were on hand to see Frank Capra's "It Happened One Night" take Oscars
for best picture, director, actor (Clark Gable), actress (Claudette
Colbert) and screenplay (Robert Riskin). Colbert was waiting for a
train at Union Station when her name was read. An academy official
tracked her down and taxied her to the Biltmore.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscars continued at the Biltmore or the Ambassador through
1943, but by Oscar's 13th birthday, the affair had become so popular
that banquets were impractical. So on March 2, 1944, the ceremony was
held at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, which had seating for 2,258. It
allowed the academy to invite not only members and their guests, but
also servicemen and women fighting in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Benny was the host that year, when "Casablanca" was named
best picture. The radio broadcast was recorded for delivery to troops
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   After three years, the Academy Awards moved to the Shrine
Auditorium for the 19th ceremony, held March 13, 1947. That year,
academy membership had swelled from 700 to 1,675. Because the Shrine
could seat nearly 7,000, the public was invited to attend for the
first time. Even so, the show wasn't a sellout and tickets were given
to members of the military.</TE>
<TE>   After two years at the Shrine, the Oscars moved to the academy's
own Melrose Avenue theater, which seated 985. The austere shift on
March 24, 1949, was made because the studios had withdrawn financial
support following rumors that they were pressuring voters. Attendees
had to be shuttled in limos from parking lots blocks away. To make
matters worse, it snowed. But the show did go on. "Hamlet" became the
first non-Hollywood best picture.The next year, the event returned to
Hollywood Boulevard, where it remained for 11 years at the Pantages
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   On April 17, 1961, the Academy Awards moved from Hollywood to the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. For the first time, ABC telecast the
ceremony, with host Bob Hope. All eyes were on Elizabeth Taylor,
recovering from nearly fatal pneumonia. She received her first Oscar,
for "Butterfield 8."</TE>
<TE>   In their 41st year, the Oscars moved to the Dorothy Chandler
downtown. Hosts of the April 14, 1969, show were "Friends of Oscar,"
including Ingrid Bergman, Sidney Poitier and Frank Sinatra. For the
first time since Beery and March, there was an acting tie. Barbra
Streisand won for her first film, "Funny Girl," and Katharine Hepburn
won her third Oscar, for "The Lion in Winter." Streisand raised
eyebrows when she accepted in a see-through pantsuit. "Oliver!"
became the last musical named best film.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really notice" the new venue, said multiple nominee
Quincy Jones, who was up for the title song from "For Love of Ivy."
"You go to the show, you are sweating about the nomination. Rod
Steiger called it pleading for your dignity."</TE>
<TE>   The Chandler was home to the Oscars until their 60th birthday,
when they returned to the Shrine, alternating between the two venues
until this year.</TE>

<DH>A specialist in adapting period works, playwright Jeffrey
Hatcher zeroes in on the English Restoration for a story about
theater and change that's surprisingly modern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeffrey Hatcher is your basic Midwesterner, but you wouldn't know
that to hear him speak.</LD>
<LD>   "I have the same splintered syntax as most Americans," he says,
"but I do prefer a level of articulation, rhetorical flourish, even
baroque phrasing on occasion. It's a little old-fashioned."</LD>
<LD>   Hatcher may be a bit baroque-friendly for a guy from Steubenville,
Ohio, but his border-crossing sensibility has helped him carve out an
unusual niche as a playwright: He's the rare go-to American who's
called on to write period dramas set in Europe. Not that there's a
lot of competition for the job.</LD>
<TE>   "I think Americans aren't as good at period dramas for a number of
reasons," Hatcher said by telephone from his home in Minneapolis. "I
think we're embarrassed by it. When we grow up in grammar school, we
do these awful pageants about Ben Franklin, and we don't have a good
history of plays and films about historical characters. If you said
to somebody, 'I want to do a movie about John Adams,' they'd go, 'Oh,
my God' and run out the door. But if you say in England you want to
do 'The Madness of King George,' they say, 'Great.'"</TE>
<TE>   Edward Kynaston makes King George seem tame by comparison.
Kynaston, a famous Shakespearean actor during the English
Restoration, is the eponymous dazzler of Hatcher's bawdy play,
"Compleat Female Stage Beauty," which is running at the Old Globe
Theatre in San Diego through April 27. And yes, the real female stage
beauty went by the name Edward offstage: Kynaston was the last and
most famous actor to play women's roles in Shakespeare's plays.</TE>
<TE>   He was knocked off that perch by Charles II when the king made the
revolutionary declaration that only women could play women in the
theater. (Charles changed the rule to appease his mistress Nell
Gwynn, possibly becoming the first guy with clout to help his
girlfriend get roles.) The adversaries are played by Tom Hewitt as
Charles II and Robert Petkoff as Kynaston.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are switched overnight," says Hatcher, 44, the Globe's
first Shiley Playwright-in-Residence. "In December 1661, men were
playing women. By January 1662, men were no longer allowed to play
women. The Restoration saw a great flowering of art and culture and
theater, but Kynaston is one of those characters who gets lost in the
flood. He became a freak within weeks. Suddenly he was a peculiar
thing, not fully a man or a woman. But what I find interesting is he
picked up the pieces and went on."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher isn't the only one to find Kynaston's peculiar story
compelling, judging from the serious interest it has elicited from
theater and film producers. (Hatcher says he tweaked the play after a
lackluster run in Philadelphia in October 2000; the Philadelphia
Inquirer complained that the play's "humor tends to be arch and
precious rather than truly funny.") In addition, the playwright's
witty take on issues the actor grappled with may have a familiar ring
for contemporary audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it hits so many bases," Globe artistic director Jack
O'Brien said. "I just did a piece about out-of-work steelworkers, and
here's an out-of-work female impersonator. Plus ca change, plus c'est
la meme chose. [The more things change, the more they stay the same.]</TE>
<TE>   "It also [asks], 'Do I keep doing what I've always done, or am I
allowed to change?' Change is the single scariest event in a human
life. Here's a character who stands on the precipice of so much
change, who's a fascinating subject to explore in the distance as
well as comment on mores and gender politics. It's a curiously modern
play couched in curiously classical language. I think it's funny,
it's true, it's moving, it's surprising. It's all the reasons you
want to do theater."</TE>
<TE>   And film too, apparently. Artisan Entertainment and Tribeca Films
are searching for a director for an independent production based on
Hatcher's screenplay. "Artisan is very serious about this," said
Rachel Cohen, Artisan's senior vice president, acquisitions and
productions. "I think we realize we have a piece of gold here. It's
very tenacious and trenchant, funny and tragic. And we want to make
that kind of movie."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher, who has written "Columbo" movies for television,
considers his highly structured playwriting style particularly
adaptable to film. "I love narrative, I love story, I love plot," he
said. "Every night when my son goes to bed, we have a 'book story,'
which I read to him, and then we have what he calls an 'invisible
story,' making one up. The theater is a little less plot-driven than
it used to be, but I always know I have to have a beginning, middle
and end."</TE>
<TE>   "Compleat Female Stage Beauty" kicks off Hatcher's residency at
the Globe, which will also stage "Smash"--his adaptation of George
Bernard Shaw's "An Unsocial Socialist," about a millionaire
socialist. The Globe will also present a reading of "Work Song,"
co-written with Eric Simonson, based on the life of Frank Lloyd
Wright. (The theater produced Hatcher's play "Scotland Road," about a
supposed survivor of the Titanic discovered on an ice floe in the
Atlantic, in 1998.) Hatcher and O'Brien are also talking about a new
commission for the Globe.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien chose "Complete Female Stage Beauty" as the first
production of the residency because the timing works for opera and
theater director Mark Lamos. But given the Globe's heritage, there's
a certain symmetry to launching the program with a new play about
that longtime Globe favorite, the Bard. The residency, bankrolled
with a $1-million gift from longtime Globe supporters Donald and
Darlene Shiley, is designed to help the theater nurture living
playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   "For 60 years, this has been an organization whose
playwright-in-residence has basically been Shakespeare," O'Brien
said. "My predecessor, Craig Noel, has often said that any theater
that spends that much time with a dead playwright should invest in a
living one. We have done a plethora of new plays here. It's not that
we're not dedicated to doing new plays, but we've never really as an
institution focused on the work of one writer in a season. So the
whole idea is to find somebody who's singing in different keys so it
isn't just a series of the same thing, but a real range of creative
output."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher's imagination took root in Ohio soil, much to the surprise
of his construction company manager father and homemaker mother. "I
was the classic only child doing plays in his bedroom, in the womb,"
Hatcher said. "I probably came out with a cape on. I have a
6-year-old, and he's already got 13 alter egos."</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Hatcher recorded the play "Sleuth" and performed both
parts for his parents, complete with sound effects--gunshots and
doors opening. He cut a dramatic figure in elementary school in his
deerstalker cap, the mark of an incipient Anglophile. When his
fifth-grade teacher asked for suggestions for the school play,
Hatcher, who'd just seen Laurence Olivier in the movie version of
"Hamlet" on television, suggested that he star in Shakespeare's
greatest hit. "She said, 'All right, you can do it, but you have to
do it in 45 minutes in class,'" Hatcher recalls. "So I got the
'Classics Illustrated' version, and my mother typed it up."</TE>
<TE>   His acting career in New York wasn't much more distinguished than
his stage debut at Starkdale Elementary School. By the time Hatcher
started trolling for parts in New York in his 20s, he was already
being passed over as leading man material.</TE>
<TE>   "I started balding early on," he said. "I have one of those Nixon
widow's peak things. I was one of those kids in high school and
college who always played older characters with a cocktail in his
hand. They were always off-off Broadway, and I never played a
character in the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher switched to writing, and when he moved his family to
Minneapolis in 1989, he forged a close relationship with the
prestigious Guthrie Theater that was unusual for someone in the local
talent pool. Again, Hatcher's work had transcended locale as well as
medium. His plays are widely produced in regional theater, thanks in
part to an acclaimed, 1994 Manhattan Theatre Club production of his
play "Three Viewings" set in a funeral parlor.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the busy playwright has written a screenplay based
on Amanda Foreman's 2000 biography, "Georgiana: The Duchess of
Devonshire," about the great-great-great-great-aunt of the late
Princess Diana, for Working Title Films, which produced "Four
Weddings and a Funeral." He's also written the book for the
Broadway-bound Jerome Kern musical "Never Gonna Dance," based on the
1936 film starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps ironically, Hatcher's limitations as an otherworldly actor
may have expanded his possibilities as a writer, helping him take his
audiences to unfamiliar places. "He's not afraid to cross the water,"
O'Brien said. "He's not afraid to go to another time zone, another
century and look around. He's curiously fearless, and I think that's
both a strength and a danger for him, because he could be playing it
safer and probably do as well if not better.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours is a society that wants you to do what you did before, and
when we like a performance or an opera, we want the composer to do it
again. It's a great problem because it may not be the best thing for
the artist in question."</TE>
<TE>   As for Hatcher, he's not worried. "We all figure that if we can
stay afloat for five, six, seven years, we have a shot at staying
afloat until we die. For me, it's been five or six years. There's
this old Robert Sherwood line, 'You can't make a living in the
theater, but you can make a killing.' It's either poverty row or you
write a huge hit. I know tons of writers who make a living in the
theater. We're not millionaires, but we do perfectly fine. People are
saying theater is on its last legs. It's fine."</TE>

<LD>Why should casting directors be concerned with Esther Riggin's
unconventional Eurasian look? Why would they want her to look "really
Asian"? Do they not realize that ethnic mixtures exist ("Everyone
Into the Talent Pool," by Greg Braxton and Dana Calvo, March 17)?</LD>
<LD>   As for casting her with white parents, well, they could cast her
with parents that reflect her Eurasian heritage and thereby give yet
another "minority" actor a role. Or cast her in a non-family part.
Thank God I did not read that agents asked whether an actor spoke
"ghetto" or "Chinese" as they have my daughter and her friends.</LD>
<LD>   I still have my suspicions that the viewing habits of the
"heartland" and the advertisers that cater to them have a great deal
to do with the number of minority actors we see on screen. It is too
bad that these, and numerous other, talented, nonminority actors do
not have the familial and other connections that so many working
actors have.</LD>

<LD>Someone once said of acting, "It is in the actor's choices that he
reveals his talent," but talent has never offered a guarantee against
bad choices ("Bad Acting Worth a Good Laugh," by Hugh Hart, March
17).</LD>
<LD>   For that matter, neither has experience. L.A. is overrun with
people calling themselves "actors." Some with talent, some with
skill, some with both, a lot with neither, but all with a million
different dreams.</LD>
<LD>   The one thing all these souls share in common is hope, the thing
that drives them. To classes taught by teachers who know nothing
about the craft of acting. To workshops taught by so-called casting
people who are seldom more than appointment secretaries. Or to
diversity showcases that are no more than cover for the big networks.</LD>
<TE>   They do some "funny but sadly pathetic" things, these actors with
hopes. Luckily it's not all for nothing. The Groundling Theatre has
found a new way to exploit these people who want so desperately "to
make a good impression."</TE>
<TE>   With their inside man (Tony Sepulveda) feeding them funny but
sadly pathetic horror stories from his day job at one of the studios,
cast members like "mature and zaftig" Lynne Marie Stewart can
ridicule the hopes of old and fat actresses playing ingenues or
"hyper-effeminate" Patrick Bristow can make us all laugh at the funny
hopes of a homosexual actor putting his "queenly spin" on Stanley
Kowalski. Only Paul Ruebens, who created the innocent Pee-wee Herman,
seems to let that inappropriate choice of "hope" into his heart, but
he catches himself; after all, as Sepulveda says, "the point of this
show is not to make fun of the actors per se, but of inappropriate
choices."</TE>
<TE>   I think any actor called in to read for "The West Wing" or "Will &amp;
Grace" should be wary of any "choices" offered by Sepulveda. He may
be mining your overzealous, underexperienced thespian hopes for new
material.</TE>

<LD>William Lorton's piece on Oscar-winning films that can't stand the
test of time really annoyed me ("And the Decade-Old Winner Is ...,"
March 17).</LD>
<LD>   Lorton sounds like an indie filmmaker who can't get past the
security gate at a studio lot and decides the only "real" movies
worth watching are the ones made with a handheld camera without a
budget.</LD>
<LD>   Well, boo-hoo. I can film my daughter's school play but that
doesn't make me Martin Scorsese.</LD>
<TE>   If Lorton is quick to elevate "Babe," a sweet but forgettable
film, to a higher plateau than "Unforgiven" and "American Beauty,"
titles he dismisses as "footnotes," then I wish him well in his
small-minded indie world.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty wrong with many Oscar-nominated movies, this and
every year, and with the way the industry functions.</TE>
<TE>   When The Times publishes Robert Altman's cogent analysis of his
alienation from, and objections to, the studio system, it is
facilitating an important discourse on the industry.</TE>
<TE>   When it puts its editorial weight behind the bitter opinions of a
frustrated wannabe, it devalues the character of its arts coverage.
Lorton is entitled to express his views, but The Times does itself a
disservice by rounding up a crowd for him.</TE>

<HD>Lauryn Hill Is Going Her Own 'Unplugged' Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do you want your favorite artists to follow up their hits or follow
their muses?</LD>
<LD>   Lauryn Hill, it seems, has done the latter with her upcoming "MTV
Unplugged" album.</LD>
<LD>   It's not the usual "Unplugged" approach of altered versions of
familiar song, but instead two CDs of new material. The songs, sung
by Hill accompanied only by her guitar, are highly personal,
emotional and in some cases topically inspired. Some run as long as
eight minutes.</LD>
<TE>   It's the first new collection from Hill since her 1998 solo debut
"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"--a huge commercial hit that won the
former member of the Fugees six Grammys, including album of the year.
Her "Unplugged" CD is certainly an unconventional way to follow such
a successful and acclaimed album.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, executives at Columbia Records, which will
probably release the album in May, hope fans and radio programmers
won't be looking for "Miseducation Part II."</TE>
<TE>   "This 'Unplugged' album stands on its own," Columbia spokesman
Miguel Baguer says. "It's a work of art that's incredibly deep. We're
completely behind it, but we don't need hype behind this. It's such a
powerful album that it speaks for itself. 'Miseducation' was
groundbreaking, and this is groundbreaking."</TE>
<TE>   But can it be a hit on the level of "Miseducation"? There are no
plans for a commercial single or video (other than the MTV show's
clips). And Hill is probably going to do only limited live
performances related to the release.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so used to the formula where there has to be a first single
and a second single and so on," Baguer says. "This is not like that.
This is bringing music back to basically just her and the listener.
That's something that goes beyond standard formulas."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey Fuller, music director of L.A. urban radio station KKBT-FM
(100.3), believes that it may be enough to satisfy Hill's fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard some of the songs, and Lauryn is in touch with people's
feelings and emotions, and as long as you can tap into that, you'll
have success," Fuller says. "That's been the key for her, and based
on what I saw and heard, I don't think she's lost that.</TE>
<TE>   "But with an acoustic presentation, you have to pick the right
song [for radio]. And I do think people will be looking for a
full-blown project from her in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   As for a full-blown studio album, Hill continues to write and
record, but no plans have been set for a release.</TE>
<TE>   THE MYSTERIANS: Hill is not the only major act with a long-awaited
project that has question marks attached.</TE>
<TE>   The king of the bunch may well be Guns N' Roses, with Axl Rose
having been working with other musicians for several years on what is
planned as the first album of new, original material since 1991's
"Use Your Illusion" paired releases. Although past reports of
impending completion have not been fulfilled, word inside Interscope
Records is that the project is starting to jell and that the album
could be released before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Other enigmas:</TE>
<TE>   * The Rage Against the Machine camp. A great deal of curiosity
surrounds the new band formed after singer Zack de la Rocha left. The
three remaining members and former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell
are said to have largely finished recording with producer Rick Rubin,
with plans for a spring release. But the official word from Epic
Records is that as of now, there is no completed album, no release
date and not even a name for the band.</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha, meanwhile, has been working on material for his solo
debut with various producers and collaborators, including Dan the
Automator (Gorillaz, Handsome Boy Modeling School) and the hot El P
(of New York's indie hip-hop act Cannibal Ox). But it remains unclear
what material will be on the album and when it may be completed.</TE>
<TE>   * Metallica. The band is working with producer Bob Rock on its
first album of new material since 1996's "Load," but no replacement
has been found for bassist Jason Newsted, who left amid some rancor
last year. The word from Elektra Records is that it's possible the
album could be released this year but not likely.</TE>
<TE>   * Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band. Several E Streeters have
confirmed that recording sessions have been held in New Jersey and
Atlanta for what will be Springsteen's first album of new material
since 1995's "The Ghost of Tom Joad" and the first with his old band
since 1987's "Tunnel of Love." In an interview with a Swedish radio
station, saxophonist Clarence Clemons said of the album, "I think
it's gonna be a more soulful, R&amp;B, rock 'n' roll, modern-sounding
kind of album." But he had no sense of when it would be done and
released.</TE>
<TE>   * Beck. His 1999 "Midnite Vultures" was a bit of a commercial
disappointment, and the eclectic artist seemed to be uncertain of
which directions to pursue next. But he's now working with producer
Nigel Godrich (who did Beck's 1998, song-oriented "Mutations") and
has also worked on tracks with Dan the Automator. There's no telling
what the record will turn out to be, but that's normal for a Beck
project. A fall release is possible.</TE>
<TE>   IN THE PINK: Music business layoffs are reaching record
numbers--EMI is expected to let go as many as 1,000 people in the
latest shrinkage. But someone's reaching out to the unemployed
masses. The annual EAT'M conference (Emerging Artists and Technology
in Music), to be held Memorial Day weekend in Las Vegas, is offering
a "pink slip discount" on its registration fee for out-of-work
staffers. With the regular cost set at $795 until May 3 and $995
after, anyone currently frozen out of the work force can get full
access to all the panels, technology workshops and band showcases for
just $200.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to help these people network and think on their feet, we
wanted to bring them here," conference founder Lisa Tenner says. "We
thought it would be helpful to industry professionals who want to
meet people and schmooze."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Fresh off the gospel Grammy win for "Spirit of the
Century," the Blind Boys of Alabama have recorded a follow-up album
with backing from New Jersey "sacred steel" phenom Robert Randolph
and his Family Band. Ben Harper, who had a song featured on "Spirit,"
plays guitar on several tracks for the new one and joins the Blind
Boys in singing "People Get Ready." No release date has been set....</TE>
<TE>   In his current incarnation as a star club and rave DJ, Boy George
has signed a North American record deal with Moonshine Music. A mix
album, tentatively titled "A Night Out With Boy George," is due June
25.... Moonshine is also behind the third annual Planet of the Drums
tour, with top U.S. drum-and-bass DJs AK1200, Dara and Dieselboy.
Dates for the six-week tour will be announced soon....</TE>
<TE>   Vince Neil has set his sixth annual Skylar Neil Memorial Golf
Tournament for May 2 at the Malibu Country Club. Honoring the Motley
Crue singer's daughter, who died from stomach cancer in 1995 at age
4, the event benefits the Neil Bogart Memorial Fund, which helps with
children's cancer, leukemia and AIDS research. The past tournaments
have raised a total of $500,000.... After making two albums for TVT
Records, lo-fi icon Guided by Voices has returned to its old home,
Matador Records, with a new album due June 18. The band is currently
on tour in Europe co-headlining with the Strokes.</TE>

<LD>   CELINE DION</LD>
<LD>   "A New Day Has Come"</LD>
<TE>   Epic</TE>
<TE>   Returning to pop life with her first new collection since 1997's
smash "Let's Talk About Love," the Canadian chanteuse tries fresh
ideas while delivering the sweeping romantic ballads fans expect. All
the while she radiates a gratefulness that reflects the personal life
she's focused on these past few years.</TE>
<TE>   Dion's work has always emphasized the power, the wonder, the magic
of love, and this 16-song album (in stores Tuesday) is a testament to
defining yourself through the adoring eyes of another. Abetting her
apparent goal of offering something for everyone are such
contributors as youth-pop producer-writer Anders Bagge, fellow
Canadian pop artist Corey Hart, and Shania Twain's hubby and
producer, Mutt Lange.</TE>
<TE>   Although the folk-rocking "Ten Days" offers the quirkiest
departure, it's the modern dance-music styles on some selections that
make Dion sound au courant. Needing no boosts from electronic
processing, her lovely voice lends these numbers a more human quality
than most current pop divas can muster.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the pulsing, soaring "radio remix" of the title track is
much springier than the non-souped-up ballad that comes later on the
album. She doesn't particularly oversing, but the love songs tenderly
celebrating motherhood and surrendering oneself to romance are still
overwrought and blandly sentimental.</TE>
<TE>   The standards "At Last" and "Nature Boy" provide better material,
but although Dion's straightforward take on the former is far less
histrionic than Christina Aguilera's, her renditions aren't
noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   R. KELLY &amp; JAY-Z</TE>
<TE>   "The Best of Both Worlds"</TE>
<TE>   Jive/Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   Money and sex have become requisite themes in R&amp;B and rap. But
this collaboration between two of the biggest stars in those
respective fields carries some unwanted baggage, with recent lawsuits
about alleged sexual improprieties involving Kelly and minors.</TE>
<TE>   All that may cast an eerie shadow on the album every time Kelly
croons about making love, as he does on the sensuous tracks "Naked,"
"Break Up to Make Up" and "Take You Home With Me A.K.A. Body."</TE>
<TE>   If you get beyond that, there's plenty of lyrical and musical
firepower present, with Jay-Z's street-based verses merging with
Kelly's thugged-out R&amp;B meditations, set to polished, radio-ready
production from the Track Masters, Charlemagne and others.</TE>
<TE>   As strong as the album is, though, there's a nagging sense that
Kelly and Jay-Z didn't always push themselves to make a revolutionary
work, settling instead for something that fans would simply accept
and enjoy.</TE>

<TE>   CASSANDRA WILSON</TE>
<TE>   "Belly of the Sun"</TE>
<TE>   Blue Note</TE>
<TE>   Cassandra Wilson's fascinating new album is a defining
demonstration of the fact that jazz singing is not about repertoire.
It is, instead, about individuality, artistry, invention and
rhythm--the qualities that allowed Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday
to transform mundane pop tunes into imaginative jazz classics.</TE>
<TE>   "Belly of the Sun" deals with more contemporary material--Robbie
Robertson's "The Weight," Bob Dylan's "Shelter From the Storm," James
Taylor's "Only a Dream in Rio"--as well as blues-based tracks from
Fred McDowell ("You Gotta Move") and Robert Johnson ("Hot Tamales").</TE>
<TE>   But the jazz foundation of the album is substantial, rooted in the
tunes' attractive harmonies, the pervasive presence of the blues, and
the improvisational recasting of the material with her associates
(including, among others, singer India.Arie and guitarists Kevin
Breit and Marvin Sewell).</TE>
<TE>   Wilson sounds marvelous throughout, employing a colorful range of
sounds--cooing, growling, teasing and whispering--to tell her musical
stories over gorgeously sparse but dramatic accompaniment. In the
process, she affirms, as Armstrong and Holiday did, that for jazz
singers, the primary encounter takes place between the singer and the
music--unlike most pop vocals, in which the primary encounter takes
place between the singer and the audience. It's a big difference.</TE>

<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</TE>
<TE>   "Pinero" soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music Latino</TE>
<TE>   In the opening boogaloo on this sizzling soundtrack, the voice of
actor Benjamin Bratt as poet-playwright Miguel Pinero is heard
declaring: "This is street reality. This is where we shout it out."
The spoken intro could be a slogan for the musical movement that
bubbled up during the '60s and '70s from the barrios of New York, a
concrete crucible for the art of transplanted Puerto Ricans. The
music is not just a fitting background for one artist's troubled life
story. It's the soundtrack of an era.</TE>
<TE>   When Pinero came of age in the late 1960s, Latin upstarts such as
Eddie Palmieri and Willie Colon were creating grooves filled with
grit and aggression, love and hope. The selections here reflect the
menace of crime-filled communities, in Colon's edgy "Calle Luna,
Calle Sol," and nostalgia for an idealized island of enchantment, in
Palmieri's pulsating paean to the homeland, "Puerto Rico."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the era's salsa classics, the producers also wisely
included rare cuts, such as the blistering "Agueybana Zemi," by Jerry
Gonzalez and Frankie Rodriguez, with all the trance-inducing force of
a street rumba.</TE>
<TE>   One quibble: no liner notes to explain the source of or the

<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Christy McWilson, "Bed of Roses," HighTone. The second solo
album (in stores Tuesday) by the Seattle singer kicks off with a
stunner--"Life's Little Enormities" is Richard Thompson meets the
Bangles, with wry, self-analytical wordplay, shimmering harmonies and
psychedelic folk-rock guitars. The closing "Tightrope" is a
boisterous honky-tonk garage-rock stomper. In between are relatively
straightforward country-rock variations, but a strong band (featuring
producer Dave Alvin and R.E.M.'s Peter Buck) and McWilson's
full-bodied voice and probing lyrics keep the album from ever seeming
mundane.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *** Ying Yang Twins, "Alley the Return of the Ying Yang Twins,"
KOCH/In the Paint. Best known for the "Snow White" knockoff "Whistle
While You Twurk," D-Roc and Kaine know how to upgrade parties into
frenzies. With their second album (due Tuesday), the Twins remain
raucous, churning out such rowdy, rapid club cuts as "Say I Yi Yi"
and "By Myself." Light on substance and heavy on celebration, this
collection provides plenty of bounce. S.B.</TE>

<LD>   Violin Concerto, Opus 14; Ballet Suite, "Souvenirs," Opus 28;

<TE>   Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Marin Alsop, conductor; James
Buswell, violin</TE>
<TE>   Naxos American Classics</TE>
<TE>   Composed between 1928 and 1952, these works, with the exception of
the concerto, are undeservedly forgotten. Hearing them again restores
one's admiration for Barber's unflagging creativity, abundant gifts
and well-honed craft. All of this music, not just the inspired Violin
Concerto, played here with easy authority and sensitive detailing by
the virtuosic American violinist Buswell, touches the listener with
its melodic flow and emotional confidence. As ever, Barber's
characteristic lyricism dominates, yet his dramatic peaks, as in the
Shelley scene, can be striking, shattering and completely convincing.
American conductor Alsop coaxes a full range of dynamics and
orchestral colors from the accomplished Scottish ensemble.</TE>

<TE>   VERDI: "Il Trovatore"</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra and chorus of Teatro alla Scala;Riccardo Muti, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   Like those art restoration projects that don't quite work out, the
new critical edition of Verdi's "Il Trovatore," the basis for this La
Scala production, recorded live, is a mixed bag, even in the hands of
a master such as Muti. The conductor forbade Salvatore Licitra--the
tenor he personally coached for the role of Manrico--from singing a
high C at the end of the aria "Di quella pira" because it wasn't in
the original score. He further banished blood and guts and
tub-thumping rhythms (except for the Gypsy camp scene, which is
demonic in intensity and sounds peopled by thousands) in favor of
literal observation of notes and dynamics. The score acquires
delicacy and suavity, but a sauve "Trovatore" means throwing the baby
out with the bathwater.</TE>
<TE>   As Leonora, Barbara Frittoli spins a creamy soprano into fine gold
in the heights, where, in newly restored passages, she sounds like
Violetta transposed from a decidedly different opera ("La Traviata").
Licitra is supposed to be the big find, a young Pavarotti, etc. Not
so fast. He has a big, dark, throaty tenor that flirts with chest
tones. He hurtles through "Di quella pira" at a fast tempo that has
its thrills. But pure gold the voice isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Nucci is a blustery, unsympathetic Count di Luna. But Violeta
Urmana makes Azucena an amazing force of nature. She also sings a
cadenza that astonishes. Brava.</TE>

<TE>   GOLDSMITH</TE>
<TE>   "Christus Apollo," Music for Orchestra, "Fireworks"</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Hopkins, narrator; Eirian James, mezzo-soprano;</TE>
<TE>   London Symphony Orchestra, London Voices; Jerry Goldsmith,
conductor</TE>
<TE>   Telarc</TE>
<TE>   While Goldsmith may believe that the 12-tone-row system is now
"almost anachronistic," as he writes in the liner notes for this CD,
it served him jolly well about 30 years ago, when most of this music
was composed. Written during a time of personal emotional upheaval,
Music for Orchestra is a concise, inventive, exuberantly orchestrated
canvas of distress. It serves as a de facto prelude to another
tone-row work, "Christus Apollo," in which Goldsmith fashions a
34-minute cantata out of a strange Ray Bradbury text that may be
about seeking Christianity throughout the universe--or something like
that. It's a mystical, ear-enticing souvenir from the year of the
first moon landing, with long stretches of narration and no maudlin
compromises. The least interesting piece is the one that reverts to
tonality, "Fireworks," a collection of pompous cinematic cliches
written for a 1999 Hollywood Bowl concert that gives the disc a
forced, cheery Tinseltown ending. Available in CD and Super Audio CD
versions, the sonics are sumptuous on both.</TE>

<TE>   SIBELIUS: Complete String Quartets</TE>
<TE>   Sibelius Academy Quartet;</TE>
<TE>   New Helsinki Quartet</TE>
<TE>   Finlandia</TE>
<TE>   If Sibelius' symphonic work is by now entrenched in standard
concert hall repertory, his chamber music is a relatively
little-known trove, and one that this fine recording helps to
illuminate. The great Finn wrote only four string quartets, and they
represent a fairly neat arc of development, from the tidy,
Haydn-esque classical rhetoric of his Quartet in E flat, circa 1885,
to the more personally expressive A-minor and B-flat quartets, from
1889 and 1890, respectively. Finally, we hear the dramatically more
expansive Quartet in D minor "Voces Intimae" (Internal Voices), a
mystically post-Romantic piece written after almost two decades away
from quartet writing, in 1909. The creative strength here triggers
speculation on where else Sibelius might have taken the string
quartet format had he continued in the medium. The deeply felt,
smartly chiseled readings by the indigenous Sibelius Academy Quartet
and New Helsinki Quartet help in making this album an ear-opener.</TE>

<TE>   "L'Orchestre De Satie"</TE>
<TE>   Orchestre de Concerts Lamoureux, Yutaka Sado, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Erato</TE>
<TE>   Erik Satie dreamed of having his music played by Charles
Lamoureux's orchestra, an alternative to the more traditional
Parisian ensembles. A century ago, its concerts were the place to
hear Bach's "St. Matthew" Passion or something new by Debussy or
Ravel, concerts where the decidedly odd Satie and a music critic once
dueled with their canes. It didn't happen in Satie's lifetime, but
finally the orchestra, under its imaginative new music director,
Yutaka Sado, is making the dream come true. In fact, the Lamoureux
Orchestra offers something altogether unusual--an entire program of
Satie's orchestral music. This includes the ballet "Parade," with its
typewriters and gun shots and other curiosities, along with small
orchestral pieces and cafe band orchestrations that Satie made of
some of his piano pieces. There are even two examples of Satie's
"furniture music," the original Muzak. Performances are striking,
maybe a little too striking, but they remind us that Satie's amazing
originality included his wonderfully peculiar uses of instruments.</TE>

<TE>   "Diary of One Who Disappeared" (to 18 poems by Josef Kalda); 15
Moravian Folksongs for piano; Seven Piano pieces, Ian Bostridge,
tenor; Thomas Ades, piano; Ruby Philogene, mezzo-soprano</TE>
<TE>   EMI Classics</TE>
<TE>   Janacek, with his obsessive Romantic nature, found a mirror in
these poems about an ordinary man who leaves everything to follow a
Gypsy girl who has seduced him. The half-hour cycle is colorful and
melancholy, although not wholly realized in Bostridge's vocally
limited and monochromatic performance. Pianist Ades--no biographical
notes are given, but this is also composer Ades--turns in a mixed bag
of accompaniments, some suave, others rough-edged. By himself, the
pianist makes a persuasive case for nearly two dozen of the
composer's miniatures--charming, bold and characterful keyboard
vignettes.</TE>

<TE>   COZZOLANI</TE>
<TE>   Vespro della Beata Vergine Magnificat, Warren Stewart,</TE>
<TE>   conductor</TE>
<TE>   Musica Omnia</TE>
<TE>   Chiara Margarita Cozzolani was a Benedictine nun fortunate enough
to have lived in the highly musical convent of Santa Radegonda, near
Milan's huge cathedral, in the 17th century. Remarkably for her time,
she published four collections of music, two of which survive, and
this three-CD box fits 12 settings of psalms and antiphonies by her
into a speculative vespers service for the Feast of the Annunciation,
circa 1650. As delectably sung by nine female singers from the Bay
Area early-music group Magnificat, Cozzolani's ideas are often quite
nice--appealingly melodic, lightly Italianate, sometimes
unpredictable (the syncopations in Psalm 112 or the honest-to-God
blue note in "O quam bonus es") or even operatic in style. The set
claims to use Cozzolani's music "wherever possible," with brief
linking pieces and a hymn from other sources. Disc 3 is occupied by
useful comments from Stewart designed to lead nonspecialists gently
into the package. R.S.G.</TE>

<TE>   YOSHIMATSU</TE>
<TE>   Symphony No. 4; Trombone Concerto, "Orion Machine," Opus 55; "Atom
Hearts Club" Suite No. 1, Opus 70b, Ian Bousfield, trombone; BBC
Philharmonic; Sachio Fujioka, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Chandos</TE>
<TE>   Ideas and colors clash on this set of orchestral works from
Japanese composer Takashi Yoshimatsu, to the point where finding the
artistic or emotional center becomes a frustrating search. His Fourth
Symphony, given a crisp and clean premiere recording by the BBC
Philharmonic, is pleasant to a fault, a half-hour piece too often
drifting into zones of friction-free romanticism and cheery tunes.
The composer suggests that it could be called a "pastoral toy
symphony," which may be the best way to consider the piece, suitable
as a kind of children's introduction to orchestral music. Greater
artistic rewards are to be found in his Trombone Concerto, "Orion
Machine," played with a sinuous ease by trombonist Bousfield. For
starters, any expansion of the too-thin ranks of music for this
under-sung instrument is a happy occasion, and the score deftly melds
musical languages, weaving in and out of tonalities (and lack
thereof) and nicely showcasing the soloist. Seriousness thins out
again with "Atom Hearts Club" Suite No. 1, Opus 70b, which freely
refers to such sources as the Beatles and Pink Floyd, and includes a
rhythmic figure filched from Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze." Its
alternately stern and giddy approach leaves us unsure: Is it a
valentine to rock or a parody of it in musical formal wear? J.W.</TE>

<LD>In 1993, Paula Holt--who wanted to produce David Mamet's "Oleanna" at
her Tiffany Theaters--was leaving her home for dinner with friends at
a Mexican restaurant when she received a call from Ricky Jay, the
magician and Mamet confederate whom she had befriended. He told her
that the planned L.A. premiere of "Oleanna" at the Mark Taper Forum
had fallen apart in a fractious dispute between Mamet and the Taper
over casting. Now was the time for her to make her move.</LD>
<LD>   Holt didn't want to stand up her friends, so she met them at the
restaurant. But she also wanted to reach Mamet at his Vermont home as
soon as possible. So she stepped away to the telephone in the women's
room of the restaurant and, using a number provided by Jay, called
Mamet's home. "You don't know me, but ..." she recalls telling the
playwright, to whom she'd never spoken. By the end of the call, she
had Mamet's verbal assent to a production of "Oleanna" at the
Tiffany, which indeed took place in early 1994.</LD>
<LD>   It was a happy ending for Holt. And for theatergoers, it was a
reminder that not every play by a stellar playwright must pass
through a large, prominent theater in order to be seen in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   That's a sometimes forgotten fact. In the vast but diffuse
theatrical landscape of L.A., many casual theatergoers seldom venture
beyond the centrally located Taper, its larger and adjacent sibling,
the Ahmanson Theatre, or whatever mega-musical happens to be in town
on tour. These theatergoers might occasionally see a show at another
large theater, especially in their own neighborhoods, but they would
rarely consider a show at one of L.A.'s many smaller venues.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these small theaters--with lower ticket prices, few bad seats,
longer runs and often strong reviews--can give L.A. audiences their
first look at new material or rare revivals of old plays.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Alan Bennett's "Talking Heads," seven monologues
including three that had never been staged, even in Bennett's home
country of England, is at the Tiffany. The Fountain Theatre is
staging the first L.A. revival in 24 years of "After the Fall,"
Arthur Miller's play loosely based on his relationship with Marilyn
Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Unfamiliar work may not ever attract casual theatergoers, but
revivals of famous titles or L.A. premieres of high-profile plays
that have been acclaimed elsewhere have a better chance. The
producers of these small productions face formidable challenges,
however. Among them is obtaining the rights to the plays.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is no ordinary market in the minds of playwrights and their
agents. In most other cities, the rights to prominent plays are
dispersed by intermediary licensing companies without direct and
careful consideration by the writers and agents. But that's not true
in New York or L.A., the major media markets, where the professional
stakes are highest.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to apply careful scrutiny to rights requests from
L.A. theaters "usually relates to the film and TV life of a play,"
New York agent Charmaine Ferenczi says. "You don't want a production
with bad publicity"--for it might be noticed by L.A. film and TV
powers, who could be considering the play for its film potential or
considering the writers for potentially lucrative screenwriting
assignments unrelated to the play.</TE>
<TE>   Agent William Craver says two of his playwright clients--whom he
declined to identify--recently turned down requests for their most
famous works to be done in small L.A. theaters. They felt their
reputations as writers were based on those plays, he says, and they
didn't want to run the risk of bad productions.</TE>
<TE>   This raises a sore point for L.A. stage producers. Craver says the
reputation of small L.A. theaters is plagued by the "perception that
many of the productions are mounted for the benefit of the actors,"
as showcases for would-be screen stars, without high professional
standards.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that the staggering number of small productions in
L.A.--an average of about 1,500 a year--is usually linked to the
staggering number of actors here. Thirty years ago, the multitudes of
L.A. actors who wanted to appear on stage in the vicinity of
Hollywood--regardless of the wage scale--led their union, Actors'
Equity, to stop requiring payment to its member actors in
sub-100-seat venues within Los Angeles County. This "Equity Waiver"
plan ended in 1988, but it was replaced by a plan that still requires
token stipends (as low as $5 a performance) in the county's small
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that small L.A. theater is often actor-driven does
not necessarily mean the resulting productions are vanity-driven or
otherwise subpar. Many serious theater artists work in small venues
here, albeit without much pay, and their productions sometimes snatch
local awards away from larger companies. Without large marketing
budgets, however, the small theaters don't always communicate their
seriousness and level of achievement to the primarily New York-based
playwrights' agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Most agents are not very familiar with the L.A. scene," says
Barbara Beckley, producing director of the Colony Theatre, which
recently moved from the ranks of sub-100-seat companies to larger
quarters--and more visibility--in Burbank. "They tend to think we're
just a bunch of actors doing a showcase."</TE>
<TE>   The writers and agents also have another reason to hope their
plays land in larger L.A. venues instead of smaller ones. The larger
the theater, the greater the writers' royalties--and the agents'
percentages.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when the Colony was still a 99-seat company in 2000,
a production of "A Shayna Maidel" required royalty payments of only
$50 a performance, Beckley says. But when the Colony presents the
L.A. premiere of "Fuddy Meers"--a play by David Lindsay-Abaire that
became available only after the Colony moved into its new 276-seat
theater--next year, royalties will be $150 per performance or 8% of
the weekly gross, whichever is greater.</TE>
<TE>   Higher up the theatrical hierarchy, a single production at the
Taper might yield a playwright royalties as high as $60,000,
according to Charles Dillingham, managing director of the Taper's
parent company, Center Theatre Group.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Matrix Theatre produced Mamet's "A Life in the
Theatre" in 1980, the Matrix sent solicitations for $100
donations--in exchange for nameplates on the theater's 99 seats--to
everyone on its mailing list. One of them went to Mamet, who returned
it with this handwritten and only slightly hyperbolic note: "I
already gave you my play for free."</TE>
<TE>   Still, because few playwrights make their primary income from
their plays--most make more money from relatively anonymous film or
TV writing jobs, or from teaching or other sources--the size of the
royalty or the venue isn't necessarily of the utmost importance. "I'm
less concerned with the venue than I am with partnering my writer
clients with top talent," agent George Lane says.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Miller, the dean of American playwrights, says he is
sometimes concerned about requests for productions in small, unknown
theaters because his plays "need a little air. Until I get some
details about the company, it sometimes sounds as if they'll be done
in a closet."</TE>
<TE>   However, when Miller and his agents receive persuasive information
about the quality of the applicants, they are open to productions in
small theaters. His "The Man Who Had All the Luck," which bombed in
its Broadway debut in 1944, received its second production just two
years ago at the 99-seat Ivy Substation in Culver City, co-produced
by L.A.'s Antaeus Company and Finesilver Shows. That production
helped attract attention to the long-ignored play, which is now set
for a Broadway production in May, starring Chris O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   Rights to the Fountain Theatre's current production of Miller's
"After the Fall" were initially turned down more than a year ago. But
the theater's artistic co-director, Stephen Sachs, sent an appeal for
reconsideration, which prompted a letter from Miller's side seeking
still more information about the company. One more written round of
bragging about such achievements as the theater's 23 world premieres,
17 L.A. premieres and 100-plus awards in 10 years finally netted the
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Beckley reports a similar experience when the Colony obtained the
rights to Miller's "Incident at Vichy" for a 1995 production. This
was the only time an initial rejection was reversed in the Colony's
years as a 99-seat theater, she says.</TE>
<TE>   The Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles recently obtained rights
to revive Miller's "The Price," after "going through a few hoops" on
the subject of casting, which Miller had to approve, says Odyssey
artistic director Ron Sossi. The negotiating of hoops may continue,
for the most notable name in the cast, JoBeth Williams, is still
awaiting word on casting in a TV pilot and may have to withdraw from
the play, which is tentatively scheduled to open April 20.</TE>
<TE>   One Miller play that no L.A. theater will get soon is "The
Crucible." The rights aren't available as long as the possibility
exists that the current Broadway production might eventually show up
in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Stern, the intrepid producer at the Matrix Theatre on Melrose
Avenue, has received his share of acceptance and rejection letters
during his 25 years of producing in Los Angeles. In 1982, Stern's
fourth show at the Matrix fell apart when a playwright friend decided
not to release rights to his play because the Matrix has only 99
seats. Next Stern was turned down for Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" on
the grounds that South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa--only about 50
miles from Los Angeles--already had the rights. But Stern was able to
convince Pinter's agent that the theaters were sufficiently far
apart. South Coast staged "Betrayal" in August 1982 and Stern
presented his version, which won seven L.A. Drama Critics Circle
Awards, in March 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Stern got the rights to Simon Gray's "The Common
Pursuit"--on the condition that he pay for Gray to fly from England
to L.A. for rewriting and give him approval of cast and director.
Stern complied, only to discover three weeks after rehearsals began
that the production required--in Stern's view--casting and
directorial changes. The changes meant another round of lobbying to
get Gray to accept them. After going through two actors, Gray
suggested casting the young Nathan Lane, who did the play at the
Matrix and later in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Stern has been unable to obtain the rights for a revival of
Lillian Hellman's "The Little Foxes," but Glendale's A Noise Within
succeeded, perhaps because it also was requesting to do "The Little
Foxes" sequel, "Another Part of the Forest," in repertory, says Geoff
Elliott, A Noise Within's artistic co-director. A Noise Within also
would pay somewhat higher royalties than the Matrix, because it seats
144, above the threshold of Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan. However, A
Noise Within was turned down for Pinter's "The Birthday Party," and
Stern snagged those rights and presented the play last year, perhaps
because of the theater's previous success with "Betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   Reasons for rejections are not always made explicit. When Stern
was trying to get rights to "The Women," he was told by an agent for
the estate of the late playwright Clare Boothe Luce, "My dear, they
can see the [1939] movie on videotape." Fresher movie deals--or the
possibility of them--are often cited, several producers said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Deaf West Theatre, which must ask for the
rights to do American Sign Language adaptations of existing scripts
(its recent hits include "Oliver!," "A Streetcar Named Desire" and
"Big River"), reports that it has never been turned down on the
grounds that the rights holder wouldn't approve such an adaptation.
"It makes it easier because we market to a special audience," Deaf
West artistic director Ed Waterstreet says.</TE>
<TE>   If Deaf West applied for the rights to the first L.A. presentation
of a well-known play, however, "that might be tough," says the
company's producing director, Bill O'Brien, because the playwright
would want L.A.'s first look at the play to be in its original form.
O'Brien also says that trying to put together touring rights, which
Deaf West has been doing recently, sometimes presents "a
Catch-22--it's hard to get the rights unless you say where you're
going, and it's hard to get the places unless you say you have the
rights."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally a 99-seat theater will pass up rights that may later
become more valuable. The Fountain's Sachs says he decided not to
pursue a chance to produce "Wit" after its premiere at South Coast
Rep; later the play won the Pulitzer Prize (and played the Geffen
Playhouse in Westwood). A few years ago, the Fountain decided not to
produce Israel Horovitz's "My Old Lady" despite a long history of
producing Horovitz in L.A.; earlier this year, "My Old Lady" turned
up in a Taper production at the Doolittle Theatre, where its grosses
did not meet budgeted projections.</TE>
<TE>   For plays a producer really wants, "a lot of it is about not
taking no for an answer," Sachs says. The Fountain tried to get the
rights to dramatize "The Great Gatsby" for years. The rights holders
said no but offered the rights to other F. Scott Fitzgerald
adaptations as a consolation. The Fountain produced "Tender Is the
Night" and "The Last Tycoon" dramatizations and, perhaps because of
that track record, finally got "Gatsby." A production is slated for
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Productions in small theaters are technically considered "amateur"
productions in rights-granting circles, even though everyone
connected with them may be a professional. "Sometimes when I'm on the
phone to New York, I can hear the tone of their voice change when
they find out we have only 99 seats," Sachs says. But he detects some
hope that New York agents may eventually change their tune. "People
in New York are starting to understand our productions won't be of
lesser value."</TE>

<HD>Since It's From Eclectic Bobby McFerrin, 'Beyond Words' Is
Beyond Category</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazz needs Bobby McFerrin. So does pop music--remember "Don't Worry,
Be Happy"? Classical music needs McFerrin too, if his work as a
conductor is any indication. In fact, music in general needs this
widely talented artist.</LD>
<LD>   Underscoring his musical diversity, "Beyond Words" (***, Blue
Note/Angel), the first release under a contract that issues his
albums jointly on the Blue Note jazz imprint and the Angel classical
label, is a collection of pieces displaying his far-reaching vocal
and instrumental skills. Fifteen of the 16 tracks are originals; the
exception is a masterful duet between McFerrin and Chick Corea on the
latter's lovely melody "Windows."</LD>
<LD>   The tracks range in length--the longest a bit over seven minutes,
the shortest only a minute and 13 seconds; nearly half are less than
three minutes. Performed by a variety of small ensembles (including,
in addition to Corea, accordionist Gil Goldstein, flutist Keith
Underwood, bassist Richard Bona, percussionists Cyro Baptista and
Omar Hakim and, on one track, son Taylor McFerrin on beatbox), the
works have the feeling of a brief but telling passage across the
colorful landscape of McFerrin's creative imagination.</LD>
<TE>   The opening track, "Invocation," reveals his remarkable scat
singing in action. At a time when far too many vocalists dip into
improvisation without either the ear or the musicality to do so
properly, McFerrin's work is a reminder of how marvelous jazz
improvising for the voice can sound when it is performed by a master.
Other pieces leap across genres: the contemporary classical-like
repetitions of "Dervishes," the bistro sound of "Chanson," the bass
and drums of "Taylor Made," and the fragmentary references to
plainsong, Middle Eastern music, African, Spanish and Asian sounds.</TE>
<TE>   But the most remarkable aspect is McFerrin's astonishing vocal
technique. Layering his voice in some spots, he becomes a virtual
one-man representation of his Voicestra ensemble; elsewhere, he
amazes with his remarkable ability to intersperse a sung melody with
low bass notes and high accents that simultaneously outline the
line's harmony. McFerrin may well be the only singer who has
developed this technique to such a high degree of sophistication. He
is definitely the only one who has done so while maintaining a career
that reaches into virtually every area of musical expression.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Acuna has had a diversified career in a somewhat different
sense. Born in Santiago, Chile, she settled on a life as a jazz
singer while still a teenager. Moving to New York before she had
become fluent in English and lacking the funds to enroll in one of
the city's many jazz programs, she simply hung out at jazz clubs,
supporting herself with jobs as a baby-sitter, dog walker and
dishwasher.</TE>
<TE>   But her perseverance finally paid off. "Rhythm of Life" (***,
Verve) is her second album. Like her initial release, "Wind From the
South," it is a blend of American ballads ("My Romance," "I Fall in
Love Too Easily," "More Than You Know") and Latin pieces ("Volver a
los Diecisiete" by Chile's masterful singer-songwriter Violetta
Parra, "Ay Mariposa" by Cuba's Pedro Luis Ferrer and "Maria Maria" by
Brazil's Milton Nascimento).</TE>
<TE>   In each case, Acuna's insists on original interpretations. Ballads
such as "My Romance" and "More Than You Know" are presented over
surging undercurrents of jazz rhythm--the latter case includes solos
from trombonist Avi Leibovich and alto saxophonist Sherman Irby.
"Nature Boy" builds from a repetitious ostinato pattern to a
climactic ending in which her musicians join in chanting "There was a
boy...."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of her accompanists, Acuna has surrounded herself with
some of New York's finest jazzmen--including, in addition to Irby and
Leibovich, bassist Dave Holland, drummer Jeff "Tain" Watts, pianist
Jason Lindner and guitarist Romero Lubambo. Billy Childs adds
beautifully crafted arrangements, especially a lovely, floating
accompaniment for Acuna's rendering of "I Fall in Love Too Easily."</TE>
<TE>   There's even more vocal jazz on the soundtrack album for the new
film "Kissing Jessica Stein" (***1/2, Verve), which provides a
mini-history of jazz singing--mostly by female artists--at its best,
concentrating on the love theme at the essence of the film's story.
The collection opens and closes with tracks from the wispy-voiced but
sophisticated Blossom Dearie, starting with "Put on a Happy Face" and
closing with "I Wish You Love."</TE>
<TE>   In between, there is a lexicon of fine vocal performances: Anita
O'Day swinging "Taking a Chance on Love"; Shirley Horn with "I Just
Found Out About Love"; Ella Fitzgerald and a ton of strings on
"Manhattan"; Dinah Washington with her ineffable rendering of "Teach
Me Tonight"; Carmen McRae finding her groove on "Exactly Like You"; a
youthful Peggy Lee doing a big-band version of "I Don't Know Enough
About You"; Diana Krall romping through "Devil May Care"; and Billie
Holiday's classic "What a Little Moonlight Can Do."</TE>
<TE>   Add to the rapidly growing list of female jazz vocal artists the
single-named Jacintha. Her new album, "Lush Life" (**, Groove Note),
was recorded in Los Angeles with the prominent participation of
players such as guitarist Anthony Wilson, accordionist Frank Marocco,
fluegelhorn player Dmitri Matheny, bassist Darek Oles and drummer Joe
LaBarbera. In addition, pianist-arranger Bill Cunliffe provided
extraordinarily atmospheric string ensemble backings for a few of the
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore-born artist cannot yet be described as a versatile
jazz singer. But in her area of specialty--sensuous balladry--she is
often extremely effective. Blessed with a dark, sumptuous sound, she
uses its whispering-in-your-ear qualities to considerable advantage.
When her phrasing is at its best, she employs subtle shifts of
emphasis as well as occasional slight variations of line to penetrate
into the heart of the material.</TE>
<TE>   Although she probably shouldn't have chosen to sing "Manha de
Carnaval" in Portuguese, doesn't quite grasp the darker aspects of
"When the World Was Young" and has noticeable pitch problems on
"September Song," Jacintha captures the essence of less demanding,
more accessible material such "Black Coffee," "Smile" and "Boulevard
of Broken Dreams." But she needs to expand her stylistic palette if
she hopes to compete with the rush of newly arriving, talented vocal
jazz newcomers.</TE>

<HD>A Question for Passover</HD>
<DH>Why is Ernst Toch's cantata different from all others?
Because, as one of the few pieces composed for the Jewish holiday, it
shows such works' potential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks ago at a concert by the Los Angeles Jewish Symphony, Ernst
Toch's "Cantata of the Bitter Herbs" was performed for the first time
in about 30 years. A forgotten work by a mostly forgotten composer,
it is a doubly neglected score. Rarer still, it represents an effort
by a noteworthy composer to write a Passover piece.</LD>
<LD>   Passover is a time when Jews remember their dramatic escape from
bondage and religious persecution. Its text, the haggada, which is
taken from Exodus, tells how the Jews were passed over by the divine
vengeance brought down upon Pharaoh's Egypt, how they made their
escape across the divinely divided Red Sea and wandered the desert
for 40 years in a determined bid for freedom.</LD>
<LD>   The Passover story is, for most people, the most exhilarating and
uplifting one in the Old Testament--Cecil B. DeMille certainly
thought so. Moses, who broke the bonds of slavery and led the Jews to
a promised land, is not only Judaism's most revered prophet, but the
deliverer of laws that are the bedrock of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. If all this--the quest for freedom, for religious tolerance,
for a homeland--isn't worthy of the inspiration of great music, what
is?</LD>
<TE>   The lack of such Passover pieces is all the more glaring given the
time of year. Passover is the ceremony of spring's onset, of renewal
and rebirth. It shares the dawning of the season with Easter, which
has given rise to some of the most profound music of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Bach's St. Matthew and St. John passions, Handel's "Messiah" and
Wagner's "Parsifal" are examples of works that in reenacting the last
days of Christ, the crucifixion and resurrection (or in the case of
Wagner's opera, their implications), offer universal insight into
suffering, self-sacrifice, rejuvenation, transcendence.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this narrative of a single death has so penetrated global
consciousness that one of the best recordings of Bach's "St. Matthew"
Passion comes from the Bach Collegium Japan. Osvaldo Golijov's "La
Pasion Segun San Marcos," a sizzling Latino setting of St. Mark's
gospel, has become, with the release of a recording of its premiere
performance in 2000, a worldwide sensation. (Yes, there is the
occasional grumpy naysayer, such as the editor of American Record
Guide, who is quoted in the latest issue as protesting, "I don't
think the Passion story of Jesus should be told in vulgar street
music.")</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, even Golijov, an Argentine Jew now living near
Boston (and composer-in-residence this season for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic), wrote a Christian passion, not a Passover oratorio.</TE>
<TE>   That there are no important Passover works written before the 19th
century may not be surprising, given that there were few major Jewish
composers and little place for liturgically based Jewish works in the
concert halls. It has never been the custom of synagogues to
commission new music for their services, as did the Lutheran church,
in the form of cantatas from Bach, or the Catholic church, in its
appetite for masses from just about everybody. The Old Testament was
always a fertile source for material for opera and oratorio, but the
closest thing to a major Passover oratorio would be Handel's "Israel
in Egypt." Halevy's "La Juive" has a Passover scene, but this 19th
century French grand opera is no "Parsifal."</TE>
<TE>   From the onset of the 20th century, Jewish composers have become
plentiful and the concert halls more ecumenical. Still, that made
little difference. Schoenberg's "Moses and Aron" (like Rossini's
"Moses in Egypt" before it) is more about the man than the events
(whereas Moses' name never occurs in the haggada, lest he be
deified). Korngold's syrupy eight-minute Passover Psalm doesn't count
for much.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the reason that the major 20th century Jewish
composers--Schoenberg, Gershwin, Milhaud, Bloch, Bernstein, Feldman,
Ligeti, Reich--haven't written for Passover is that they haven't felt
the need. The biblical narrative is so compelling, and Jews are so
obsessed with it, that they have made Passover an occasion for a
ritual enactment at home, in the celebration of the Seder. Using the
haggada as a guide, prayers are recited, Passover songs are sung,
bitter herbs that recall the bitterness of slavery are tasted, wine
is drunk at specific points, along with many other rituals. Another
tradition is the analysis of the biblical story the night through,
while some of the most observant Jews go so far as to flood the
floors of their home and wade through the waters in remembrance of
the Red Sea crossing.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Passover's personal religious observations, Easter
is a more public holiday, with its week of special services and
spectacles, including such customs as the Hollywood Bowl sunrise
service. Consequently, what Passover music there is tends to function
less for sacred purposes than as popular entertainment, show-business
arrangements of the Passover songs equivalent to those of Christmas
carols.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in 1937, Toch felt a need to make a public statement. The
emigre composer, newly arrived in Los Angeles, had just learned of
the death of his mother in Vienna and of Hitler's armies now in his
native land. He could not help but identify those events with the
exodus of the Jews from Egypt. With the help of a noted local rabbi,
Jacob Sonderling, he fashioned an English-language text based on the
haggada, and wrote a cantata for chorus, orchestra, four vocal
soloists and narrator. The work was premiered in Los Angeles in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The cantata tries too much and too little. The narration is a bit
stilted (although at the recent performance, it needn't have been
quite so lifeless as it was when read by Leonard Nimoy). The choruses
and solos are mostly prayers and psalms. In his Los Angeles years,
Toch, who showed an experimental streak in Vienna, had two musical
styles. He wrote serious symphonies, string quartets and other works
in a complex, often grim but also gripping, highly chromatic style.
He also scored films in a populist, though never trivial, way (he was
especially good at capturing the angst of noir and the weirdness of
science-fiction).</TE>
<TE>   For his cantata, he wanted immediate communication and wrote in a
manner that is even more direct than that of his film music. The
music is far from easy, as the recent tentative performance proved.
But in trying to create a work that approached common vernacular and
still expressed deep meaning and intense emotions, Toch never quite
found the balance. A childlike simplicity, sweet and innocent,
pervades the score. I kept wishing, in hearing it, that he had
followed the example of Bach and Wagner, which was to stretch the
idiom of his music as far as he could in the search of the most
penetrating expression.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the ending, a tender plea for peace that was eloquently
sung by baritone Michael Sokol, got to me. On the day of the concert,
Israel had sent its tanks into the West Bank city of Ramallah. With
the Israelis and Palestinians appearing blinded by their sense of
biblical prerogatives, the Passover story can seem to justify
barbarity. The genocidal Pharaoh ordered the killing of every newborn
Jewish male child. When the Pharaoh refused to let the Jews go,
Aaron, Moses' brother, threw down his rod and through divine
intervention caused the plagues upon the Egyptian people, culminating
in a visit by the Angel of Death to the firstborn in every Egyptian
household. To my mind, both Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat had come
to seem intolerant, destructively inflexible, angry old men right out
of those terrible earlier times.</TE>
<TE>   The first half of the concert, in Beverly Hills High School's
acoustically challenged K.L. Peters Auditorium, didn't help assuage
the day's gloom. It consisted of the local premiere of a "Pesach"
Cantata (Passover Cantata), in which Passover tunes, sung by a couple
of hammy cantors, were merrily jazzed up with waltz rhythms, Verdian
oration, and even a cowpoke gallop or two by Raymond Goldstein,
associate conductor at the Jerusalem Great Synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Such cheap entertainment may be a welcome diversion in Israel
these days, but I think the gentle persuasiveness of Toch's "Cantata
of the Bitter Herbs" should be more welcome still. The notable Easter
works that many of us will be listening to this week are a boon to
humanity. With even a modest work, Toch shows us that a Passover
cantata might have similar potential. With the situation so bad in
the Middle East, we can't wait forever. Toch's kind-hearted message
of peace in the time of war needs to be heard.</TE>

<LD>It was that old purveyor of gloom Edgar Allen Poe who used the line,
"The nothing of a name."</LD>
<LD>   A name like Arthur Andersen perhaps? A name is something you can
register, sell, trade off of, borrow on, cash in on, emblazon on
T-shirts and sully. But extract justice from it?</LD>
<LD>   I'll grant you that the government's criminal indictment of
Andersen has a certain satisfying, take-that ring to it. But, really,
is there much more here than Poe's nothing?</LD>
<TE>   About Andersen, we can make three guesses: Not everyone who worked
in this vast global accounting and consulting firm last fall was
crooked. Some were. None of them had a birth certificate saying
Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   So who was responsible for evidence shredding, not to mention the
larger crimes that cost millions? Let the hammer fall on them. Let
them stand in the dock. Send them to the Big House. Drain their bank
accounts for restitution. Real people with real names who did their
profession and millions of investors dirty--not the ghost of an old
man, once esteemed and now memorialized on a letterhead 55 years
after his death.</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not defending a company with a record like this one's.
Published reports indicate that at least four Andersen clients have
been tagged for juiced books, and that was before Enron.</TE>
<TE>   How many strikes do you get in this league, anyway?</TE>
<TE>   But it's not enough to say the letterhead did it.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is a web of partnerships. And it's the partners who
benefit from Andersen's name. Want to bet whether they benefited
handsomely over the years?</TE>
<TE>   It would be grossly trite to say that names don't commit crimes,
people do. But I can't resist.</TE>
<TE>   That's the trouble with white-collar crime. For too long, we've
been dismissing wrongdoers with halfhearted fines and allowing them
off without admitting guilt so they don't clog up the courts or get
booted off the country club rosters.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Andersen got caught with its signature over inflated
profit statements before. That involved a company called Waste
Management Inc. At the time, Andersen executives bargained with the
government and got off easy. They paid a fine and signed a promise
not to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   Now, finally, matters have gotten so bad that the government has
awakened from its stupor, snarling and snapping.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the indictment is meant as one of those proverbial messages
to other free-enterprise corner-cutters, although if you scratch
deeply behind the known facts, one unfortunate interpretation of the
message is likely to be that businesses with matters to hide should
not let their documents pile up too long before shredding.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment carefully says nothing about what documents were
destroyed." That's one of the objections that Andersen has made in
trying to portray itself as a victim of "a gross abuse of government
power."</TE>
<TE>   No kidding, that's the company's official line.</TE>
<TE>   Let me mention events of last October. On the 23rd, The Times
carried a story about Enron shares dropping 21% while the "SEC
requests information from company on a series of unusual financial
deals."</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Andersen clerks were said to be lined up at the
shredders with trunks of work sheets and memos pertaining to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Now Andersen lawyers say that since the evidence is missing, how
do prosecutors know it was evidence?</TE>
<TE>   Imagine if you were called to serve on the jury and had to listen
to arguments like that?</TE>
<TE>   Guilty? You have to feel bad for the mail-room employees, computer
technicians and the thousands of others in the Andersen enterprise
whose lives are being cast adrift for something they had no hand in.
Just more carnage piling up. Yes, this is another of Andersen's
official complaints about the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   But in this instance, the firm has a point.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people I know are pretty sure that crimes were
committed by those who dug this gargantuan rabbit hole in Houston.
Evidence shredding is a start. But when it comes to justice, there
are people behind these crimes.</TE>
<TE>   We deserve to know who did it. And not incidentally, did what
exactly and for how much gain.</TE>
<TE>   Then we can hope to recall a more famous line of Mr. Poe's:
"Nevermore."</TE>

<HD>Romer Beats Back an Ambush</HD>
<DH>But to get the job done, he must make allies of Latino
parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At times, schools Supt. Roy Romer must feel as if he's in the Alamo.
No sooner does he quell one uprising in the sprawling, heavily Latino
school district than another group of Mexicans besieges him from
another direction.</LD>
<LD>   That's pretty much what happened March 12. Barely an hour after
skillfully settling a long political standoff over the Belmont
Learning Complex, Romer was fighting with a powerful Latino
politician on another issue. Last week he beat back that ambush, too.</LD>
<LD>   Romer didn't win a couple of terms as governor of Colorado and
head the Democratic National Committee without learning political
survival skills. Still, "I do sometimes wonder what I got myself into
here," he said, adding that the political infighting he's seen in the
20 months since being named chief of the nation's second-largest
school district is as rough as anything he's ever experienced.</LD>
<TE>   The defenders of the Alamo faced frontal assaults by a known
enemy. Romer's problem is that in L.A., politics is a cross-fire
among several potent factions.</TE>
<TE>   These factions are especially self-righteous in the Los Angeles
Unified School District. They all claim to have the best interests of
700,000 young students (and 400,000 more in adult education) at
heart. They include teachers unions, bureaucrats at headquarters and
even paternalistic philanthropists.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years the most volatile element has been meddling
politicians--most recently state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles). He's the guy who ambushed Romer on March 12 with a proposal
to spend $6.3 million on an unproven adult literacy program.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco's goal was laudable--providing more English-language
instruction for immigrants. The problems began when he told Romer in
a televised school board meeting that he already had the votes to
approve the literacy program. Polanco had met privately with
individual school board members to promote the program, called
Reality Based Learning California.</TE>
<TE>   Romer warned the senator that his tactics went outside the normal
school district procurement process. LAUSD lawyers also said
Polanco's lobbying could be construed as a violation of state laws
prohibiting private meetings of public bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Romer's protestations, the school board approved the
literacy program 4-3. The yes votes came from board members who
either felt indebted to Polanco--an effective political fund-raiser
and campaign organizer--or wanted to curry favor with him.</TE>
<TE>   The stink of an already smelly deal got worse over the next few
days when it was revealed that Reality Based Learning California is
not affiliated with a reputable company with a similar name in
Washington state but is instead a start-up firm. And its three
employees just happen to work out of a Los Angeles law firm run by a
longtime Polanco ally.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder that at last Tuesday's school board meeting the
erstwhile supporters of Reality Based Learning California said they
had been misled, and the contract was rescinded.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage from this flap was to the reputations of the
naive school board members who allowed themselves to be seduced, or
cowed, by Polanco. The senator is so accustomed to controversy that
he'll likely shake off this setback and await another chance to throw
his weight around the LAUSD.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, Polanco pushed his way into school district politics
at the behest of Latino activists angry at the equally ham-handed
meddling of Anglo politicians such as former L.A. Mayor Richard
Riordan. It was Riordan and his political cronies who engineered the
election of the current school board majority and the firing of a
popular Latino superintendent, Ruben Zacarias, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Romer had nothing to do with Zacarias' ouster, but it haunts his
own tenure. No single event did more to create the Alamo scenario
Romer faces now. It gave Latino activists a reason to be angry with
the district and Latino parents cause to feel alienated from it.</TE>
<TE>   Romer's push to complete the controversial Belmont project went a
long way toward healing that rift. Polanco's power play could have
reopened it, but the senator arrogantly overplayed his hand. Before
Polanco, or some other ambitious pol, sets another ambush for Romer,
the school board chief would do well to cultivate closer ties with
the only group that has the numbers to keep the other factions in the
LAUSD at bay: the grass-roots Latino parents whose children are 70%
of Romer's constituency.</TE>

<HD>Let the Voters Decide on Old-Growth Trees</HD>
<DH>Timber industry has tried to circumvent a forest
initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHAD HANSON</AU>
<BD>Chad Hanson is executive director of the John Muir
Project and a national director of the Sierra Club.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gray Davis was campaigning for governor, he promised that he
would protect all remaining old-growth trees in California--a promise
that he has thus far failed to keep.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' inaction sparked a citizens' initiative known as the
California Heritage Tree Preservation Act, which would protect trees
over 150 years old on nonfederal commercial forest lands. It would
not apply to urban or suburban settings. (A recent announcement by
Boise Cascade regarding its old-growth practices does not affect
California.)</LD>
<LD>   The initiative is backed by a broad coalition of environmental
groups and religious organizations that have been collecting
signatures to qualify the initiative for California's November
ballot.</LD>
<TE>   However, in a shameless effort to deprive Californians of their
right to vote on this important measure, the California Forestry
Assn.--the timber industry's lobbying arm--filed an eleventh-hour
writ to invalidate signatures gathered and force the process to start
over. Although a Superior Court judge rejected the industry's claims
last month, logging interests have indicated that they will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry claims that the title and summary of the
initiative, which were prepared by Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, create
"prejudice in favor of the initiative" by using "politically charged"
words such as "old growth," "heritage trees" and "protects." The
industry also claims that preventing the felling of ancient trees
shouldn't be described as "protecting" them.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's legal wranglings have led most observers to
conclude that its true goal is to stall the signature-gathering and
block the initiative from qualifying for a vote this year. The next
eligible statewide ballot is 2004. By that time, timber corporations
will have cut many of the trees that the initiative seeks to protect.</TE>
<TE>   Californians should be outraged. The ancient-tree protection
initiative would give voters an opportunity to choose between the
short-term profits of timber executives and the long-term welfare of
future generations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service estimates that, in the last 150 years,
more than 80% of the old-growth forests in the Sierra Nevada have
been lost because of logging. Even more dire estimates apply to the
coastal redwood forests and the coast ranges in Northern California.
Yet the chainsaws keep cutting.</TE>
<TE>   On nonfederal lands in California there are virtually no
meaningful protections for old-growth forests. Timber giants such as
Pacific Lumber and Sierra Pacific Industries routinely clear-cut vast
swaths of ancient stands on the lands they own. According to
estimates from the state, Sierra Pacific has increased clear-cutting
on its lands by more than 2,000% in the last several years. Neither
Davis nor the state Legislature has acted to stop this devastation,
despite the fact that such practices have been shown to irreparably
damage vital wildlife habitat, as well as increase the risk of severe
fires.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed California Heritage Tree Preservation Act is a first
step toward protecting the remnants of California's original forests.
While it would not protect whole ecosystems, it would at least stop
the largest, oldest trees from being cut down and hauled to the mill.</TE>
<TE>   Voters should be allowed to decide.</TE>

<HD>For Nine States, a Second Bite at the Microsoft Apple</HD>
<DH>Double jeopardy isn't fair to the company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT A. LEVY</AU>
<BD>Robert A. Levy is a senior fellow in constitutional
studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in
Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been 10 years since the Microsoft antitrust case began. The cost
of the litigation--in time, money and diversion of executive
resources--has been enormous. With the nation transfixed by Enron's
$60-billion collapse, it's worth recalling that Microsoft's
shareholders suffered an $80-billion erosion in market value on a
single day--April 3, 2000, when U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his conclusions of law.</LD>
<LD>   Now the case continues on two parallel tracks: in a Washington
courtroom, where a federal judge ponders whether a long-awaited
settlement between Microsoft and the Justice Department serves the
public interest; and in that same court, before the same judge, where
nine states of the 20 that had originally joined the federal suit
demand that Microsoft's conduct be more severely restricted.</LD>
<LD>   Both court proceedings are based on the same trial, the same
findings of fact, the same conclusions of law. Both proceedings
allege the same injuries to the same people.</LD>
<TE>   If that sounds like two bites at the apple for the nine states,
double jeopardy for Microsoft and a waste of taxpayer resources,
that's exactly what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one of 50 states accept the Justice Department's assessment
that the settlement advances the public interest. Thirty of those
states didn't even sue Microsoft, two others abandoned the suit and
nine more signed on to the settlement. That leaves the District of
Columbia and nine states attempting to substitute themselves as
enforcers of the federal antitrust laws and the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys general in the nine states, including California,
concede that their state and federal claims are the same. They also
acknowledge that Microsoft's behavior did not affect their citizens
more profoundly than anyone else. Yet they want much broader relief
than the settlement affords--to vindicate their singular view of the
public interest. But Congress did not intend that states--in a case
where the Justice Department has already spoken--could supersede the
role of the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the remarks of federal Appeals Court Judge Richard
Posner, who mediated an abortive Microsoft settlement two years ago.
Posner offered these recommendations in a recent issue of the
Antitrust Law Journal: "I would like to see, first, the states
stripped of their authority to bring antitrust suits, federal or
state, except ... where the state is suing firms that are fixing the
prices of goods or services that they sell to the state.... [States]
are too subject to influence by ... competitors. This is a particular
concern when the [competitor] is a major political force in that
state. A situation in which the benefits of government action are
concentrated in one state and the costs in other states is a recipe
for irresponsible state action." Amen to that.</TE>
<TE>   So what is a state to do if it doesn't like the settlement? There
is a comprehensive legal process, established by the Tunney Act in
1974 and now underway in this case, for determining whether antitrust
decrees are in the public interest and how nonsettling parties can
voice their objections. Yet the nine states mostly rejected the
formula prescribed by Congress so they could pursue their own
strategy to override the federal settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the Justice Department and 20 states, responding to the
special interests of rival businesses, combined to challenge
Microsoft. Now, with that challenge resolved to the satisfaction of
almost everyone, nine out of 50 states shouldn't be allowed to wreck
the settlement--or even delay it long enough to spoil our economic
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Let the software industry get back to serving its customers and
get self-aggrandizing state attorneys general such as California's
Bill Lockyer out of the business of enforcing federal antitrust law.</TE>

<LD>Many thanks to Natalie Nichols for her mention of the Sillies in her
story on Detroit bands ("What's All This Detroit Noise?," March 17).
After 25 years, we are finally releasing a "debut" album and will be
flying to L.A. in July to do some shows. It will be good to think
that someone other than a handful of former Detroiters will have
heard our name. A little more encouragement like this and we would
have done it 25 years ago.</LD>

<LD>Pause in comfort for a moment this morning, while sipping your coffee
or juice, to consider what just happened in Afghanistan. For a
generation, we've seen many things blow up in that dusty, medieval
land, especially in the months since we saw some things blow up in
our own modern land. But Saturday, Afghanistan's Monday, was the
first day of the first new school year there in many years.</LD>
<LD>   Can you recall the wonder and excitement of school's first
day--the new shoes, new friends, new routine, books and things to
learn? Well, here's what they're excited about in Afghanistan's
Taliban-free schools--having shoes, getting a classroom, fewer
bullets flying around, books lacking bigotry, no arrests of teachers
for instructing girls.</LD>
<TE>   Life won't change in one semester. War there has been an enduring
business and way of death. And appalling American ignorance and
indifference helped create the Afghan anarchy so fertile for Al
Qaeda. True, some schools have 1,000 pupils for 10 classrooms,
requiring shifts. Rooms are unheated. Some have desks. But thanks to
an amazingly swift effort involving UNICEF, numerous nations and
millions of American youngsters who mailed $4.6 million of allowances
and earnings in response to President Bush's plea, maybe a third of
Afghanistan's youths--by a rough wartime estimate--started down the
long road to literacy this weekend. Charity aside, think of this as
American self-interest. One more nation's new generation of boys and
girls openly growing and learning together is one less home for hate
and intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   America's neighborhoods, schools, faculties and families are not
perfect. But tomorrow, on America's Monday, when you're about to
mutter over school buses waddling along, the momentary gridlock at
school drop-offs and the fresh ink stain on the right knee of
someone's newest school pants, think for a moment about Afghanistan's
schools, where they're so tickled that the artillery shell holes are
patched and there's actually glass in the windows. As we await spring
break and those college acceptance letters, maybe there's an
important lesson about education and our own lives to learn here from
the distant crude classrooms there.</TE>

<LD>Powerful forces often seek to influence the presidential libraries
that in turn help to shape history. Yes, folks, we're talking about
money and politics. And even the mists of time don't stop the
struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Controversy has been brewing in Illinois, for instance, since that
state's governor recommended a man with no experience as a historian
or curator to be director of the $115-million Abraham Lincoln Library
and Museum planned for Springfield. The presidential pardons scandal
tarnished the planned Clinton Library in Little Rock, Ark., after it
drew significant donations from pardoned financier Marc Rich and his
former wife, Denise Rich.</LD>
<LD>   Richard M. Nixon, who knew a bit about money and politics, was a
key architect of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba
Linda. But that has not kept surviving members of the former first
family from trading legal briefs over how the museum should be
governed.</LD>
<TE>   Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower's long-simmering feud tumbled into
the public domain after The Times reported that the sisters are
squaring off in court over a significant financial bequest from the
late Bebe Rebozo, a longtime Nixon friend.</TE>
<TE>   Money is an important issue for the only presidential library that
doesn't accept federal operating funds. The Rebozo bequest could more
than double the $13-million endowment at the library, which helps
make ends meet by renting itself out for weddings and fashion shows.
A planned expansion would make more room for fund-raisers, but
historians would rather see the library acquire important Nixon
presidency records that are still housed in a National Archives annex
in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Cox argues that Nixon family members have a right to accept and
distribute funds as they see fit. Eisenhower long has maintained that
funding and strategic decisions are best left to the broader,
24-member library foundation board set in place during a 1997
reorganization that helped professionalize the library.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon Library opted from its beginning to eschew federal funds
and operate outside of the National Archives' supervision. Given the
tumult surrounding Nixon's presidency, the library has a special
obligation to ensure academics and armchair historians that it stays
at arms' length from strong-willed family members and influential
donors.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's vision of a family-dominated committee would send the
library backward, away from any scholarly respectability. Eisenhower
is right to embrace a broader, more experienced board that, while
top-heavy with such Nixon associates as Henry Kissinger and Kenneth
L. Khachigian, seems better equipped to protect the museum's assets.</TE>

<HD>Secession: Rising 'What Ifs?'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven months away from a likely vote on San Fernando Valley
secession, a new Los Angeles Times poll put support at 55% in the
Valley and 46% citywide. Not surprisingly, secession advocates are
elated by the close poll. We hope that residents on both sides of
Mulholland Drive are sobered by it.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles is one of the world's best-known cities. Deciding
whether to break it into as many as four parts, now that the harbor
area and Hollywood have petitioned to secede as well, is one awesome
responsibility. Splitting up a city this huge, erasing its history,
disentangling its layers of assets and liabilities have never before
been attempted.</LD>
<LD>   Overseeing the process is a little-known but powerful board called
the Local Agency Formation Commission. So far it has not inspired
confidence in its impartiality. The partly elected, partly appointed
commission seems far more eager to get secession on the ballot than
to judge whether the new cities would be able to support themselves
financially without harming what's left of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The commission ordered analysis of the Hollywood cityhood bid
speeded up so that it could appear on the same ballot as the
secession bids from the Valley and harbor areas. That, secession
advocates believe, would boost the chances of each, and the
commission was more than happy to oblige. It hired a private firm not
so much to analyze the secessionists' proposals but to come up with a
plan that could make it onto the November ballot without being
stopped by litigation. Los Angeles would continue owning all assets
and providing all services to the breakaway cities, which would spend
virtually all their revenues paying for these services.</TE>
<TE>   A commission subcommittee has since come up with more detailed
recommendations for dividing assets. A Valley city would get its
parks, libraries and police and fire facilities, and Los Angeles
would keep the Department of Water and Power. The breakaway city
would still contract with L.A. for actual police and fire protection
and many other services. The full commission will decide which if any
plan is put on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee is on the right track in attempting to give
voters more details about what secession would be like. But it's not
there yet. Aside from the question of why residents would want their
city to get into the contracting business--that debate will come
later--they need to know what it's going to cost. They also need to
know how things would work during a crime spree or a drought if their
city was obliged to provide services to nonresidents rather than be
free to move resources where required. And they need to be told what
the cost would be to new and old cities if after the first few years
a new city stopped using those services and developed its own.</TE>
<TE>   The same poll that showed broad support for secession
paradoxically found widespread satisfaction with Los Angeles. Two in
three respondents said things were going well. Fewer than three in 10
said things were going badly. Voters deserve to know exactly how a
breakup would make things better--or worse.</TE>

<LD>Bill Hauck and Roy Romer's position will turn the clock back to the
days when teachers in K-12 were treated as little more than hired
hands, subject to the whims of administrators and politicians
("Should Teacher Legislation Go to the Head of the Class?"
Commentary, March 19).</LD>
<LD>   As a practical matter, their argument will only make it harder to
recruit and retain the kind of talent the nation's public schools
will need to meet the daunting teacher shortage of 2 million expected
over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   If teaching is to be truly a profession, its practitioners need to
be accorded the same authority and respect that characterize other
professions. Anything less than full parity will undermine attempts
to turn around failing schools.</LD>
<TE>   Teacher unions, despite what Hauck and Romer maintain, are not the
enemy. They exist because there is no other way for individual
teachers to make changes that will ultimately benefit students.</TE>

<TE>   I worked in Los Angeles Unified for 16 years, and many times
during this period I felt powerless in the decisions that were made
to try to provide the wonderful students I taught with a sound
education. After constant frustration with the LAUSD's approach, I
finally moved to a suburban district that actually consults me and
values what I say when it comes to the curriculum and methods in the
education of the students I teach.</TE>
<TE>   I know now that my role as a teacher is important, not only for my
students but for the parents, administrators and board of education
as well, because I am the one who knows my students best. The role of
teachers is extremely undervalued, and LAUSD Supt. Romer would be
failing more than 650,000 students if he did not recognize that
teachers should be the core of the district's knowledge and strategy
for improving student achievement.</TE>

<TE>   Wayne Johnson's preposterous analogy comparing school
administrators, most of whom began their careers as teachers, and
school boards to HMOs is way off the mark (Commentary, March 19).
This isn't about brain surgery, it's about how best to teach our
kids. Equally preposterous is that AB 2160 would somehow improve
California schools. Collective bargaining was, quite rightly,
established to protect the interests of employees--in this case,
teachers--and not the interests of the community, the parents or the
kids. Nor was it designed to take the place of representatives
elected by the community to set education policy or the professional
staff hired by them to manage and run the public school system.</TE>
<TE>   The fact of the matter is, AB 2160 would undermine our school
accountability system, increase administrative costs and exclude
parents and the local community from otherwise participating.</TE>

<LD>Re "Saudi Editor Retracts Article That Defamed Jews," March 20: The
Times is to be complimented for the coverage of the recent revival of
the old, anti-Semitic blood libel issue. That such a report could
still appear in Al Riyadh, a newspaper controlled by the Saudi
government, in 2002 shows how deep is the hatred of non-Muslims
(specifically Jews and Christians).</LD>
<LD>   Egyptian editor Adel Hammouda's remark that there is nothing
governments can do to stop the spread and expression of anti-Semitic
feelings is ridiculous. As soon as the U.S. government brought this
matter to the attention of the Saudi government, the editor of Al
Riyadh found an "excuse" to explain how such an article appeared in
his paper.</LD>
<LD>   If such lies and hatred are not nipped in the bud, they will
continue to bring forth another generation of hatred.</LD>

<LD>On March 16 my wife and I were driving in West Los Angeles along
Wilshire Boulevard around 8 p.m. On passing the Federal Building near
Sepulveda Boulevard, we could not help but notice the brightness of
the building due to every darn light in the building being
illuminated. Either there were a lot of federal employees working
late into the night (yeah, sure) or all those state and common-sense)
admonitions about conservation simply do not apply to government
buildings.</LD>

<LD>The Holland, Mich., Life Savers workers losing their jobs to
Canadians should thank Congress for perpetuating artificially high
sugar prices in the United States through high tariffs on imported
sugar ("Workers Feel Like Suckers," March 20). In trying to prop up a
few jobs in sugar-producing states, Congress is merely causing
economic dislocation of the kind causing the Life Savers factory to
move across the border. The tariff that saves one person's job is the
tariff that kills other jobs.</LD>

<TE>   As I read the sad story of the more bitter than sweet goodbye to
Life Savers, I kept looking for mention of Cuba. The economic squeeze
that forced the move from the U.S. to Canada surely had something to
do, I thought, with the fact that Cuban sugar is embargoed to the
U.S. but Canada buys all it can use at a much lower cost than we can
buy domestic sugar.</TE>
<TE>   I had to wait until I got to "Stopping the Cuban Vacation Crisis"
in the same edition to find the angle that was missing on the front
page. Steve Lopez, as he does so frequently, exposed irony and
hypocrisy, this time in the form of our anti-Cuban policy.</TE>

<LD>The problem with "The Mainstreaming of Latino Politics" (Opinion,
March 17), about the recent Sanchez-Morales contest for the Texas
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, is that its author, Gregory
Rodriguez, is guided by the perception that Mexican Americans are
only identified with an immigrant story. In that, candidate Dan
Morales is a Mexican American because he matches that perception, but
not his gubernatorial rival, Tony Sanchez, "who traces his
Southwestern roots to 18th century Spain." Nonsense.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Sanchez is a descendant of Spanish colonists of the
northern territory that eventually became Texas, whose inhabitants,
after Mexico's War of Independence (1810), became Mexicanos; then,
after the Mexican American War (1846-48), Mexican Americans--that
designation reinforced by intermarriage with 20th century Mexican
immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   These early Tejanos, or Mexican Americans, are a sizable and
influential demographic in south Texas. Besides oilman Sanchez, it
includes Lauro Cavazos, former secretary of Education under Bush the
elder, and Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, who headed U.S. Army forces in
the Panama Canal during the Manuel Noriega capture.</LD>
<TE>   In his mudslinging strategy for heavily Latino south Texas,
Sanchez portrayed himself as the authentic Mexicano, partly because
of his early ancestral pedigree, and his rival as a falso, made
vulnerable by his poor command of Spanish. And it worked--he got
two-thirds of the Latino vote in that part of the state.</TE>

<LD>How dare The Times glorify Jordan's King Abdullah's self-serving
statement ("Hope Amid the Wreckage," editorial, March 21)) comparing
the fear of Palestinians to eat in a restaurant or send their
children to school to the real-life fears of Israeli families.</LD>
<LD>   Israel does not "ignore these basic human problems." Israel is
striking at military targets, usually with advance warning, and
sometimes regretfully hurting civilians (most often when the
terrorists are hiding behind or among them). The Arab terrorists are
striking daily at Israeli civilian men, women and now children, right
where they live, with no military advantage to be gained.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone but the most jaded can at least recognize the difference
in tactics and policies of the Israelis and the belief in the
significance of a single human life as opposed to the Arabs
continuing to kill innocents as well as their own people and
themselves.</LD>

<TE>   In your editorial, you refer to Yasser Arafat as the "man who has
fumbled so many opportunities to improve the lives of Palestinians"
and say he "should seize this one." And on the same day, after his
public promises to the U.S. that he is sincerely interested in peace,
we hear of yet another suicide bombing of innocent civilians in
Israel by one of his group's members.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade is linked to Arafat's Fatah
organization, and its activities have never abated despite Arafat's
words. Isn't it time for our country to recognize that Arafat is a
terrorist; that he is part of the problem and not in any way linked
to peace?</TE>
<TE>   Israel should be allowed to defend itself, and we who believe in
peace must find other Palestinian leaders whose word we can truly
trust.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Bill Approved by the Senate</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Campaign Reform Bill Passes Congress; Bush Says He'll Sign,"
March 21: To think it has been seven years to get this hard-won
legislation through the Congress. The point man for the opposition,
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has made some incredibly telling
comments about the nature of the bill and its effects on the
electoral process. If he were not so serious in his position, it
would be absolutely laughable.</LD>
<LD>   Now he wants to spend our money to file a lawsuit challenging this
legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Time and again, McConnell had shamelessly said in no uncertain
terms that this bill would damage the GOP in its ability to retain
political power, more severely than it would the Democrats. With
congressional Republicans getting the lion's share of Enron's
influence peddling, those on the right side of the aisle knew full
well what their chances for reelection would be if they gave
McConnell their full backing on this issue.</LD>
<TE>   This bill got a new lease on life, as we all know, thanks to the
Enron debacle, and the people finally spoke up.</TE>
<TE>   Now, about those millionaire lobbyists. . . .</TE>
<TE>   David Ohman</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After seven years of struggle, Congress passed campaign finance
reform. John McCain is hugging Tom Daschle, and George W. Bush,
fearing his own political defeat in 2004, reluctantly has agreed to
sign the bill into law. Thank you, Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph S. Brax</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) says she is "personally grateful"
because the campaign finance reform bill will bar citizens groups
from using any sort of advertising to review or attack a candidate's
policies or votes in the last two months before an election ("Uphill
Fight Becomes an Avalanche," March 21).</TE>
<TE>   So, what she is really saying is that she is grateful that this
bill will squelch open discussion and debate of her policies. How
undemocratic.</TE>

<HD>The Three-Second Rush</HD>
<DH>Though often illegal, BASE jumping--parachuting from fixed
objects--is gaining popularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The athletes move through the new Nike commercial in about two dozen
sports that you usually don't get arrested for--gymnastics, boxing,
snowboarding, familiar sights on the U.S. fitness landscape--and then
the one exception.</LD>
<LD>   The camera pulls back for a long shot of an athlete named Lottie
Aston, whose feet dangle over the edge of a towering steel bridge.
She jumps.</LD>
<LD>   Under a blue sky, Aston's parachute unfurls for a 730-foot drop.
She lands upright in a canyon and then sprints off.</LD>
<TE>   Aston was allowed to make the jump under a special film permit.
But in the U.S., her sport--called BASE jumping--usually is
prohibited and practiced in secret.</TE>
<TE>   BASE is an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span (bridges) and Earth
(cliffs), the main spots from which the parachutists leap. All are
unforgiving, low-altitude places that promise a singular ground rush
and, on occasion, James Bond-ish thrills. In downtown Los Angeles,
for instance, jumpers sneak into sites such as the 1100 Wilshire
building and, to avoid potential trespassing charges, parachute off
the 37-story luxury office tower at night.</TE>
<TE>   Stealth jumps notwithstanding, the sport is beginning to emerge
from the underground. An unofficial network of longtime BASE jumpers
is riding a spike in the sport's mainstream appeal, which, they
acknowledge, is limited by the fact that most U.S. buildings and
lands are unavailable to them. Still, in a bid for credibility--and
more legal jump sites--veteran jumpers are offering training sessions
and camps that stress safety, and selling gear made specifically for
their sport.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the sport's profile is being raised by BASE
jumpers who sign deals as sponsored athletes and appear in film and
video projects distributed by big names such as the National
Geographic Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "This [exposure] gives us a chance to come out of the darkness,"
said Felix Baumgartner, 32, a BASE jumper who is sponsored by Red
Bull, the hip energy drink company. "This sport has so much power.
It's so strong. Most people who watch BASE jumpers don't believe what
they see."</TE>
<TE>   In December 1999, Baumgartner traveled from his home in Salzburg,
Austria, for an attempted launch from an internationally recognized
icon: the 98-foot-tall Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro.
From launch to impact, Baumgartner would have 2.5 seconds--long
enough, he hoped, for him to pull his parachute and for the canopy to
inflate properly and slow his descent so he could land on his feet.
He would have no time for a reserve parachute, no time to correct for
a swirl of wind. (By contrast, a typical skydive from an airplane, at
an altitude of 3,000 feet, takes roughly two to three minutes until
touchdown.)</TE>
<TE>   After five months of training, Baumgartner headed for the base of
the statue with a crew of assistants. On a morning with no wind,
Baumgartner began his ascent with the help of a ground crew that
watched for security patrols. At daybreak, he fired a cable from a
crossbow that allowed him to climb to the statue's outstretched arm.
He jumped and landed without incident, rushed into a getaway car that
had bogus license plates and made international news.</TE>
<TE>   Long before BASE jumpers began inviting public attention, their
so-called bandit jumps were known to other BASE jumpers through lore
marked by bravado. In private, some veterans tell of concocting
elaborate ruses involving forged employee passes, paying off security
guards and removing air-conditioning grates, all to pull off a
stealth building jump. In 2001, BASE jumpers were arrested or cited
for parachuting off buildings in cities including Minneapolis, New
York and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 8 at about 2 a.m., 29-year-old Robert Tompkins parachuted
from the top of the 1100 Wilshire building, according to Los Angeles
police. He landed, uninjured, on an officer's car.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police officers have spotted four other people
parachuting off that building in the past year, said police Lt. Jose
Perez. Police are concerned about what would happen if such a jumper
should land in traffic, he said. But there's not much officers can
do. "You would have to have someone on the roof 24/7," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Buildings such as the 1100 Wilshire tower are known to BASE
jumpers nationwide who trade information about sites that have easy
rooftop access. (Representatives of 1100 Wilshire did not return
calls for comment.) In October 2000, a Denver police surveillance
team began monitoring the 37-story Embassy Suites hotel, which, at
the time, was known as a BASE-jumping hot spot, officer Jody Pulford
said.</TE>
<TE>   One night, 31-year-old BASE jumper Hank Caylor and a friend
managed to elude police and get to the roof. Caylor, who was an
experienced skydiver and BASE jumper, dove off the building first and
found himself in immediate trouble. His chute malfunctioned, slamming
him through double-paned glass windows on the 21st floor. He was
treated for minor injuries and arrested on suspicion of reckless
endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   During Caylor's trial, prosecutors contended that hotel employees
or pedestrians could have been hurt by shattered glass from the
botched jump. But Caylor was acquitted. In news stories, jurors said
Caylor had planned the jump with care and was not reckless; they also
pointed out that there was no specific law against BASE jumping.</TE>
<TE>   Legalities and potential dangers tend to be overshadowed by the
striking images of BASE jumpers in flight, which increasingly are
being wrapped in credible packages. Two months ago, National
Geographic Channel began airing a 26-part adventure series in the
U.S. called "Out There," which includes an episode featuring Santa
Barbara BASE jumper Tom Sanders and his leap off the world's tallest
waterfall. Sanders parachuted off Angel Falls in Venezuela--film
producers got permission for the event--in tribute to his wife, Jan
Davis, who died 2 1/2 years ago, at the age of 58, while BASE jumping
in Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Nike campaign tapped Aston for its 90-second "Just Do It"
commercial, which was intended to show how movement links athletes in
a wide range of sports, including BASE jumping. "It's one of the more
stunning parts of the ad," Nike spokesman Scott Reames said of the
bridge jump. "You're sort of caught for a second--'What was that?'
... It's young, it's edgy, it's another form of expression. People
who don't necessarily want to be comfortable with the status quo. You
can't deny the coolness factor." A small-print warning notes that a
permit was required for Aston's jump off the Foresthill Bridge near
Auburn, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The sport is also finding a new audience and cachet via unexpected
marketing efforts. A Red Bull Web page featuring its extreme
athletes, for instance, credits Baumgartner with making the world's
lowest BASE jump, from the Christ statue. (In a phone interview,
Baumgartner, a professional extreme athlete, said he warns wannabes
away from attempting the kind of jumps that he lands.)</TE>
<TE>   "We really support the individual spirit," said Emmy Cortes, a
spokeswoman in Red Bull's Santa Monica-based North American
headquarters. She notes that company-sponsored BASE-jumping
expeditions are only made at legal sites outside the U.S. "Humans
taking flight has a lot to do with our brand.... [BASE jumping] is a
perfect image. It encourages people to take risk and live a little."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the demographic, Ensure nutritional products
sponsored North Carolina BASE jumper Jim Guyer, 73, who agreed to
promote Ensure in 2000. Ensure's maker, Ross Products, didn't attach
any conditions to his jumps but doesn't "endorse any type of illegal
activity," Ross spokeswoman Chris Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Legalities vary from location to location--there are no uniform
laws prohibiting BASE jumping.</TE>
<TE>   Jumps are allowed with the permission of, say, a property owner.
Barring that, jumpers find places where they won't be charged with
violations such as trespassing or reckless endangerment--for
instance, some cliffs overseen by the Bureau of Land Management.</TE>
<TE>   And occasionally the door swings open. This year, and in 2000, a
contingent of U.S. BASE jumpers plunged off buildings in Malaysia at
invitational events; a promotional event in February was endorsed by
Malaysia's youth and sports minister.</TE>
<TE>   In October, West Virginia will host about 300 BASE jumpers from
all over the world on Bridge Day, the state's largest single-day
festival. As part of the event, which attracts 80 to 100 media
representatives from every continent except Antarctica, jumpers will
parachute off the 876-foot-tall New River Gorge Bridge in Fayette
County, by special permission of the state legislature. The
eight-second jumps are preceded by gear checks and other safety
precautions.</TE>
<TE>   BASE jumpers aren't welcome in most other U.S. jurisdictions,
acknowledged Keith Spangler, chairman of the Bridge Day Commission.
But "well, West Virginians, we have a sense of adventure. [We're]
free-spirited. The Western slogan is 'wild and wonderful.'"</TE>
<TE>   All the recent exposure could backfire if it prompts a rush of
newcomers, acknowledged Jason Bell, 31, of Bridgeport, W. Va. On his
Web site, www.vertical-visions.com, Bell stresses that BASE jumping
is hardly a spontaneous form of expression. Rather, it requires years
of training and at least 150 skydives, Bell advises newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, most BASE jumpers have tended to be careful,
experienced skydivers. "When I started jumping in '93, it was very
much in the closet," said Bell, a mechanical engineer. "Now it's like
everyone and their mother is jumping.... It's amazing what it has
evolved into."</TE>
<TE>   The sport took off in the late 1970s, after a handful of
experimental skydivers began making regular jumps off El Capitan in
Yosemite. For the next 15 years or so, BASE jumpers hooked up with
one another by asking around at skydiving drop zones. In 1994 a Web
site, www.blincmagazine.com, began its role as a BASE jumper's hub.</TE>
<TE>   So far, BASE jumping has no recognized governing body or oversight
by entities such as the FAA, which sets standards for some skydiving
equipment. BASE jumpers have no formal organization that can track
figures on such things as participation and fatality rates. But Bell
and other experienced U.S. BASE jumpers are working on a plan for a
structured group that will, among other goals, propose safety
guidelines later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The group is led by Mick Knutson, 31, a software architect who
runs the BASE jumpers' Web site in Salt Lake City. The site gets
260,000 hits a day, Knutson said. In the U.S., he estimates that
there are about 10,000 active BASE jumpers. By his count, the
fatality rate is low. Worldwide, in the past 20 years, 41 people have
died on BASE jumps, Knutson said. (By comparison, from 1990 to 2000,
the U.S. Parachute Assn., the FAA-recognized group that sets
voluntary safety standards for skydivers, has tracked 349 fatalities.
There are more than 350,000 skydivers nationwide, according to the
Virginia-based association.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, with the help of digital cameras that record their
efforts, pioneering BASE jumpers say they have been able to perfect
techniques for a new generation that doesn't have to jimmy up
skydiving equipment anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started, there was no sport," said Anne Helliwell, a BASE
jumper since 1981 and a longtime skydiver. "It was an act of
foolishness, basically, that we got away with." Now, she said, she
thinks of the sport as high-risk but much safer than it used to be.
The company she co-owns, Basic Research Inc., in Perris, Calif.,
designs and manufactures BASE jumping gear. Helliwell teaches BASE
jumping courses, leading expeditions to legal sites in Norway and
elsewhere. She also is designated by the FAA to give exams to people
who rig parachutes for skydivers.</TE>
<TE>   Skydivers tend to be divided about BASE jumpers, said Jack
Gramley, general manager of Perris Valley Skydiving center, which
offers a school and drop zone. "You either have a group of skydivers
who say, 'Those people are crazy. What are they doing?'" said
Gramley, a competitive skydiver and FAA-certified parachute rigger.
"Then you have those skydivers who say, 'I wouldn't have the guts to
do it, but I really admire that they do it.'"</TE>
<TE>   (U.S. Parachute Assn. officials declined to comment on BASE
jumping, noting that the participants use different equipment and
different techniques than skydivers do.)</TE>
<TE>   BASE jumping demands unshakable nerves, said Jean Potvin, a
skydiver and physics professor who studies parachute inflation and
flight at St. Louis University. "I look at [them] and think, 'Oh boy,
you're taking a chance.... Those people have crossed the
psychological barrier, and they trust their equipment."</TE>
<TE>   The new BASE-specific gear is reliable, and the sport can be
practiced safely by experienced jumpers if all goes well, Potvin
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the ante is upped for those who want to jump off buildings, he
said. Odd winds that swirl around high-rises could slam a parachutist
into a window. Vision becomes tricky on a nighttime jump from a
high-rise, when the backdrop is darkness and not blue sky. Jumpers
must be able to steer their chutes away from power lines, telephone
poles and other obstacles. All in a matter of seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Night jumps aren't gutsy enough for some, though. On a
Blincmagazine.com forum, a participant dismisses them as wimpy. "I
have 127 jumps, all from very high-bust factor buildings," the writer
noted in a March 10 posting. "I've always jumped at midday during the
week to ensure great light conditions for [my] camera. Why would you
jump under moonlight? The jump wouldn't show up very well in film and
no one would be able to marvel at your courage."</TE>
<TE>   If there were more legal sites, BASE jumpers wouldn't have to
sneak around, and the sport would be safer because people could
practice in daylight, said Blincmagazine's Knutson. He doesn't
approve of jumps like the one Baumgartner made off the Christ statue,
saying, "There's too much disrespect to the country, to the item
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Knutson said he typically enters buildings through unlocked doors
and follows the leave-no-trace ethos that he promotes on his Web
site. "I take nothing and leave nothing," he said. "All I'm doing is
borrowing a little altitude at two or three in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   The jumps, he said, are about staring down fear, about dreams.
"Standing up on the edge of a building ... it's very personal and
very deep," Knutson said. "You can't explain the euphoric feeling
that you get, and the little hairs standing up on your hand when
you're in free fall.... You're flying like you wished you did when
you were a kid."</TE>

<HD>Don't Forget to Look Gorgeous</HD>
<DH>Fashion * For an ordinary woman, finding the perfect dress
to wear to the Oscars is nearly as difficult as earning a nomination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago I was asked a question: "Would you like to cover the
Oscars this year?" What I heard was: "Is it physically possible for
you to look gorgeous for even one night?"</LD>
<LD>   I said yes. How could I say no?</LD>
<LD>   Normal women are rarely required to look gorgeous. For the
occasional New Year's Eve party or work-related bash, it is perhaps
something to aspire to, and on their wedding days, most women would
prefer to hear they look "gorgeous" rather than "pretty" or, God
forbid, "fine."</LD>
<TE>   At the Oscars, however, it is required. Even of the press. Oh, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn't list it along
with all the other commandments and tips (all this year's guests were
advised to wear comfortable shoes). But any woman who finds herself
in possession of Hollywood's golden ticket knows that it is much more
than an invitation. It is a challenge. To look gorgeous.</TE>
<TE>   For actresses, that's easy. For actresses, getting ready for the
Oscars requires little more than showing up to be fitted and plucked
and smoothed and dressed by designers.</TE>
<TE>   The process for the rest of us is nowhere near as benign. The only
thing in my closet that resembles formal wear is my wedding dress,
and though I toyed with the idea of dyeing it black, the marital
symbolism that involved seemed far too dangerous. After calling
around to everyone I could think of who had gone or is going, I
realized that although I am on the very low end of the fashionista
spectrum, I am not alone in my quandary. Nor even in my eyeing of the
nuptial robe.</TE>
<TE>   When Patty Eliot Tobias got engaged to her husband, Joe Adamson,
who works for the academy, she realized she couldn't afford two great
gowns in one year, so she chose a wedding dress that could do double
duty.</TE>
<TE>   "It is midnight blue and had this chiffon wrap that could be done
in different ways," said Tobias, a senior editor of publications at
the Writers Guild West. "So in March I wore it as a wrap, and then
when I got married, I wore it as sleeves."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, she said, was very impressed that he was marrying
"someone so sensible." Since then she's attended the Oscars a few
more times and feels a bit more relaxed. This year she bought a
simple black sheath with two fancy jackets. "Now I have enough
dresses. I can alternate if I want to," she said. But, she added, she
hasn't been able to wear the midnight blue dress again anywhere,
including the Oscars. "It's very strange," she said, "but now it's my
wedding dress."</TE>
<TE>   Georgianne Bernstein also went all out her first time, several
years ago, with a red Bob Mackie covered in about 10 pounds of beads
and glitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it on sale at Nordstrom," she said. "It was very, very
expensive, and I've never worn it since."</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein's husband, Charles, has been on the academy's board of
governors for the last seven years, so they have been to the Oscars
more often than many celebrities. This year she's wearing a gown she
and a friend constructed from a vintage beaded dress. Bernstein, who
is a dancer, always does her own hair and makeup, and ever since the
Mackie year she has developed a better sense of her own Oscar
style--comfortably elegant rather than high-wattage.</TE>
<TE>   As in many areas of fashion, some women instinctively find the
perfect dress in the shop around the corner, and some women ...
don't. When she was nominated for best short documentary last year,
Tracy Seretean hit the usual suspects--Saks, Neiman Marcus and some
Beverly Hills boutiques--but couldn't find a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I saw required a roll of duct tape to keep on," she
said. "Two wisps of chiffon posing as a dress."</TE>
<TE>   Panicking slightly, she began calling designers and telling them
she was a nominee. "Which was so bogus because no one with any juice
in Hollywood would be making these calls," she said. Her fluency in
Italian warmed the heart of a woman at Valentino enough that Seretean
was allowed to peek at the designer's look book. "I picked three
dresses I liked, and this woman told me Julia Roberts had all three,
so she wouldn't be able to tell me which one I could have until
Friday. I thought, I am anxious enough about this thing without
having to wonder what I'm going to be wearing."</TE>
<TE>   So when Sharon Stone's assistant happened to call her asking for a
copy of her documentary, Seretean, knowing that Stone was a good
friend of designer Vera Wang, managed to let the assistant know she
was desperately dress-less. A few phone calls later, Seretean was
cashing in her frequent-flier miles and flying to New York "because
they sure weren't going to send me a dress sight unseen, and they
wouldn't even make a recommendation without seeing what kind of body
I had."</TE>
<TE>   Her father bought her the dress she chose. "It really was the
perfect dress," Seretean said. "Everybody said so." And plenty of
people got a look at it--Seretean won her category, realizing as she
made her way toward the stage that 4-inch heels--"the highest shoes
I'd ever worn"--had probably not been the best choice.</TE>
<TE>   Four-inch heels will also carry Philippa Boyens down the aisle
should she and co-writers Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh win best
adapted screenplay for "The Lord of the Rings." And they will be the
only thing she managed to choose on her own.</TE>
<TE>   Her ensemble has been orchestrated by a group of her friends in
New Zealand who did not trust Boyens' fashion sense in the least. "No
one could even mention a nomination possibility around me," Boyens
said. "But meanwhile they were all talking behind my back about how
if we should get one, someone would have to take me in hand. They
were all very afraid I would show up in something I had just pulled
out of my closet."</TE>
<TE>   When the nominations were announced, one of Boyens' friends put
her in touch with Trelise Cooper, New Zealand's top designer, who put
together a black beaded lace skirt and satin tuxedo jacket.
Meanwhile, Boyens said, her friends keep checking in on her. "They
keep calling to find out if I had gotten a haircut, if I have someone
to do my makeup."</TE>
<TE>   The proprietary feeling that New Zealanders have toward the film
apparently extends to seeing the filmmakers turned out
well--L.A.-based Kiwi hair and makeup stylists stepped forward to
help her. "It's all quite amazing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As a non-nominee, I had no such team and nowhere near the
pressure. I concentrated on simply getting a dress that would not
make me an obvious floating target for Joan Rivers and her
straight-from-the-id nightmare shtick. Following Boyens' lead, I did
get a haircut, but I think I am too old to start messing around with
makeup. My only hope for gorgeous was the dress.</TE>
<TE>   But here is something you should know: Evening gowns run about two
sizes smaller than normal clothes, so at a time when you want to look
and feel your sveltest you're looking at size tags with double
digits. Here is something else you should know: Formal dresses cut on
the bias, and that is most of them, are the most unforgiving garments
you will ever meet. As one friend put it: "I saw lumps I never even
knew I had."</TE>
<TE>   So after a morning of on-again, off-again designer wear, most of
which I absolutely could not afford, I pulled into the
handkerchief-sized parking lot of One Night Affair, which rents
wedding and evening gowns. According to manager Jeffrey Gates, the
store dresses from 400 to 600 Oscar guests a year, including, he
said, some of the biggest stars. "They figure, why pay $2,800 for a
dress they're going to wear once when they can rent it for $175?"</TE>
<TE>   A hundred or so of his clients will coolly show up the last week,
30 or so on the day before. "Sometimes we get women who decide at the
last minute they aren't happy with the dress they've bought," Gates
said, "but we also do a lot of out-of-town guests. And a lot of
press."</TE>
<TE>   After trying on a half-dozen of my own picks, I threw myself on
the mercy of the assistant, a lovely young woman who brought me a
stack of dresses I would never ever have thought to try on. She
kindly didn't tell me what size they were. About halfway through, as
I tunneled through a satin underskirt and hitched myself into a
strapless beaded bodice, I swore I was going to pull a Sharon Stone
and go in a floor-length navy matte jersey turtleneck dress, which I
actually own and which, I think, looks just fine.</TE>
<TE>   With this in mind, I yanked open the curtain to look in the mirror
one last time and literally gasped in shock. Hello, Gorgeous.</TE>

<LD>Who are those courageous school administrators who dismissed the
sexual harassment of a Pacific Palisades High School female teacher
by saying, "Boys will be boys"? (Sandy Banks, "A Missed Lesson in
Limits of Vile Speech," March 19).</LD>
<LD>   If the underground student paper had gone after a black or Jewish
teacher because of his or her race or religion, would administrators
have dismissed it so blithely?</LD>
<LD>   Who are those parents so wrapped up with their son's college
chances that they ignored their offspring's vicious acts and shameful
attitudes? Why are female students demonstrating support for their
male colleagues writing about "humiliating girls during oral sex" and
"slapping girls around"? What do the parents of these girls think
about this?</LD>
<TE>   Most of all, what now? Parents, teachers and administrators cannot
remain silent on this issue. The sexist attitudes expressed in the
student newspaper are damaging to the victims and the perpetrators
alike--and it's going to take a community effort to expose and defeat
them.</TE>

<LD>With obesity at epidemic levels nationwide and young girls and women
doing damage to their bodies in the quest for the perfect body size,
you run an article about a plus-size doll that will hopefully give
Barbie a run for the market ("Plus-Size Doll Casts Shadow Over
Barbie," March 5).</LD>
<LD>   But in describing size 12 as a plus size, you reinforce the idea
that unless you are a size 10 or smaller, you are fat. For many woman
who are size 16 and above, a size 12 seems a lot more obtainable than
a 6 or 8.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks for the reminder that even at a healthy size 12, we would
still be considered plus size.</LD>

<LD>I've read the story of the Dear Abby columnist who called police over
a letter writer who said he was attracted to underage girls ("No
Advice This Time, Just a Call to Police," March 15). What she did was
reprehensible, as her column is based on the anonymity of the writers
being sacrosanct.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the March 8 City of Angles column: The item on novelist
Richard Ford mentions an audience member taking exception to Ford's
"lack of grammatical correctness in his new book (one story features
a series of sentences that end in propositions) ..."</LD>
<LD>   Not yet being familiar with that particular story, I can only say
that, if each sentence ends in a proposition, that potentially juicy
story is the first I'll be turning to. Oh, excuse me, the first to
which I'll be turning.</LD>

<HD>Getting Wayward Teenagers Back on Track, on the Field</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The girls are clustered around the starting line, peeling off their
warmups and stretching their legs for the race. "Ladies," the starter
calls, waving them to their spots. "Remember to remove your jewelry.
No earrings, rings ... no jewelry allowed."</LD>
<LD>   A laugh emerges from the center of the crowd. "Jewelry?" chortles
a member of the Lady Royals of Scott Academy. "I haven't worn jewelry
in six months. I'm in jail!" she said. The other runners--girls from
tony private schools--smile, some wide-eyed, as they remove their
earrings and necklaces.</LD>
<LD>   The starter gun sounds, and the girls take off, the distinctions
between them lost in the blur of a dozen pairs of pounding feet. The
Lady Royals are the last to round the track, staggering in well
behind the others.</LD>
<TE>   But in the stands, their parents cheer victory, not defeat. "I am
so proud of you!" one mother shouts, leaning over the railing and
reaching down, as if she could embrace her child. A dad waves a
stopwatch with Olympic fervor. "Three seconds!" he yells to his
daughter, who plops down on the grass to untie her shoes. "You're
three seconds faster than last week!"</TE>
<TE>   I was at the track meet to cheer on my daughter but had spent much
of that afternoon studying the Lady Royals and wondering where they
were from. The other teams--Harvard-Westlake, Oaks Christian--and my
daughter's high school I recognized. But Scott Academy? What kind of
private school is that, I wondered. And why did their athletes seem
so ... well, un-athletic, fumbling to set their blocks, bouncing as
they ran, chatting more enthusiastically about the snack bar menu
than the competition on the track?</TE>
<TE>   The "academy," it turns out, is actually Camp Scott, a boot camp
in Saugus for wayward girls, part of the Los Angeles County Probation
Department's network of camps for delinquent juveniles. And the Lady
Royals represent a new dimension in rehabilitation--the realization
that sports can have the same redemptive power for girls that they
often do for boys.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, sports have been a part of the probation
department's program for boys. Camp Kilpatrick in Malibu has teams in
basketball, baseball, football, soccer and track competing in the
California Interscholastic Federation against small independent and
religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   Many Kilpatrick alums say the opportunity to play on camp teams
helped turn their lives around. Some did well enough to earn college
scholarships. For others, lessons learned in sports translated to a
new sense of self-respect and responsibility when they returned home.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there aren't occasional problems. Last spring, the star
of the Kilpatrick basketball team slipped away after he was allowed
to play in an all-star game in Long Beach. The high school senior,
who was nearing the end of his one-year camp term, went on the lam
after telling a game official he was going to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   But Art Gonzalez, who coaches Kilpatrick's track team, said his
squad hasn't had that kind of trouble. "Most of the kids really
appreciate the opportunity to be in the spotlight. This doesn't have
the glory of football or basketball, so these guys learn to support
each other."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's athletic director, Karon Howell, said track has been
particularly good for her girls, as well. "You can see the growth as
the season goes on. They're learning how to deal with stress, with
disappointment, how to start something and stick with it until you
finish, about hard work and self-discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these girls are in here because they have trouble with
authority," Howell said. "In track, you've got a coach always riding
you, pushing you, giving you instructions. That's not easy for them.
But they're learning not to take it personally, to understand that
the coach is trying to make you better, not hammer down and be
critical of you."</TE>
<TE>   In track, it's you against the clock or tape. Practice hard and,
over time, you can sprint faster, jump farther, throw harder, run
more laps without collapsing. It's the sort of measurable improvement
that has often been lacking in these girls' lives.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly track meets provide them with unique chances for
camaraderie with kids from different backgrounds, of different
sensibilities. And the private-school teams are enriched as well by
their contact with kids from circumstances so different from their
own. "Track is the only sport where you come down to the infield and
talk, hang around with other athletes, while you're competing," said
Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Howell said, the girls from Camp Scott have benefited.
"At our first track meet, a girl from Brentwood [private school]
befriended one of our girls. She was helping her with the shotput and
they just sort of hit it off. They hung out pretty much the whole
time. The Brentwood girl bought some food and came over and shared it
with my team.</TE>
<TE>   "Things like that happen, and I see my girls just opening up,
seeing new possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   If it's been good for the girls, it's been great for their
parents. "They see their daughters, who may have always been in
trouble, in a whole different light when they're at a meet," Howell
said. "They love to see their daughters competing. They come out and
cheer, they encourage the girls. And that's exactly what these girls
need."</TE>
<TE>   And if there is a silver lining to incarceration, it might be that
if they hadn't landed in jail, few of these girls would ever have
played a sport or been on a team. Now, some will head back home with
a different vision of themselves, a new sense of accomplishment. In
that is the thrill of victory.</TE>

<LD>A trio of parties--with the proceeds going to charities--marked last
weekend's opening of the Grove, L.A.'s newest mega-mall adjacent to
historic Farmers Market at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. The warmup
started midweek with a Nordstrom reception to benefit Childrens
Hospital of Los Angeles and continued to an event at Maggiano's
Little Italy Restaurant to benefit the Heart Fund at Cedars Sinai
Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   But the big bash--with fireworks, a performance by tenor Russell
Watson and the unveiling of "The Spirit of Los Angeles," a bronze
sculpture of two dancing angels, created by De L'Esprie--was held the
night before Friday's public opening. For the gala, tables, covered
in citron cloths with centerpieces of white roses, were arranged
along the main thoroughfare. There, Regency Club chefs served chicken
Wellington and white chocolate mousse with raspberries to more than
1,800.</LD>
<TE>   Grove developer Rick Caruso and his wife, Tina, hosted the gala,
which netted $450,000 for the National Institute of Transplantation.
Heavy traffic had L.A.'s finest on swarm, and a drastic plunge in the
temperature kept the bartenders scurrying. One early arrival, Chuck
Reed, was spotted pleading with a Banana Republic staffer to unlock
the door and sell him a sweater, which Reed wore all evening with the
security sensor attached. KTLA weatherman Mark Kriski, who emceed the
festivities, told the shivering crowd, "If you want to boo me, now's
the time; go ahead." They did.</TE>

<TE>   Scripter Awards</TE>
<TE>   The Scripter Awards Dinner, sponsored by the Friends of the USC
Libraries, was back in its old digs on campus last weekend. After an
18-month face lift, Doheny Memorial Library was reopened in October.
Its Italianate reading room with the long tables, where legions of
Trojans have scratched their initials and stashed their gum for 70
years, had been home to the ceremony since Marjorie Lord Volk and
Glenn Sonnenberg established the event 14 years ago to honor the best
adaptation of a book to the motion picture screen. Author Sylvia
Nasar and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman took home this year's laurels
for "A Beautiful Mind," the portrayal of tortured mathematical genius
John Nash. Volk's daughter, actress Anne Archer, and "Mind" co-stars
Paul Bettany and Josh Lucas presented awards. In accepting hers,
Nasar praised Goldsman's ability to tell the story of a brilliant
mind affected by schizophrenia. "Akiva let the audience see the world
through Nash's eyes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin MacLeod emceed and veteran comedy writer Hal Kanter served
as grand master. Special guest included Scripter award nominees Helen
Fielding, author and co-screenwriter of "Bridget Jones's Diary'' and
Rob Festinger, co-screenwriter of "In the Bedroom.'' Also there were
Scripter committee chairman Al Ruddy; Joan Jani-Mimms, who chaired
the event; Sue Femino, Friends president; Katherine L'Amour; Virginia
and Si Ramo; Del Reisman; Susan Babcock; Kacey and Peter McCoy; Terry
Stanfill; Donald Gibbs; Bob Sattler; Elaine and Ken Leventhal; Bonnie
and Richard Cook; Joanne and Montgomery Fisher; the newly engaged
Tari Susan Hartman and Jason E. Squire of USC's Department of Cinema
and Television; and Veta and Jerry Campbell, dean of the USC
Libraries, who announced that the event raised $100,000 to help
"ensure that USC will never be at a loss for words."</TE>

<TE>   Luminaires in Pink</TE>
<TE>   The main lounge on the first floor of the California Club was
bathed in "surprise pink" lighting for the Luminaires' annual fashion
show to benefit Doheny Eye Institute at the USC School of Medicine.
"My father and my uncle must be rolling over in their graves,"
muttered one amused member as he watched 300 women establish a
beachhead in this one-time male enclave. Even the lounge furnishings
had been moved to accommodate a runway for the first fashion show
ever staged there, a parade of spring/summer designs by Escada.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't so long ago that this was off-limits to an unescorted
woman," recalled Alyce Williamson, who co-chaired the March 13 event.
Following the show, Luminaires president Sonia Hathaway led the way
to the dining room, where florist Tommy Farmer continued the all-pink
theme with arrangements of tulips in tall crystal vases; a meringue
basket filled with pink strawberry mousse topped off the asparagus
soup and lobster salad.</TE>
<TE>   A few guys did brave the crowd--Cheryl Craft, a professor at the
Keck School of Medicine at USC, brought along her colleagues Stephen
Ryan, dean of the school, and doctors John Irvine and Eugene de Juan.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Galpin and Kelsey Hall also co-chaired the benefit, which
raised $100,000.</TE>

<TE>   Barry in the Night</TE>
<TE>   Performing at the Grove of Anaheim, easy-listening icon Barry
Manilow crooned mega-hits such as "Mandy" and his new release, "Turn
the Radio Up," during a benefit concert put on by KOST-FM on behalf
of the American Heart Assn. The "Love Songs Live" production helped
raise $10,000 for the association's community education programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for coming to this special show," Manilow said. "But where
are we? When KOST said they had a special evening planned, I didn't
know we were going to be in beautiful, downtown Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he liked the 1,200-seat venue (the Grove is the former
Sun Theatre) and added, "You know I like intimacy." Actors Harry
Hamlin and Lisa Rinna were among guests attending a preconcert
reception held in the facility's Terra Rosa Room. Their favorite
Manilow hit? "'I Write the Songs,'" they chimed.</TE>
<TE>   Guests at the March 14 concert included Bob Greenberg, chairman of
the Orange County division of the American Heart Assn.; Stephen
Lazar; Stephanie Ross; Karen Sharp; Ginny Carpenter; and Peter
Bastone.</TE>

the Philharmonic Society of Orange County attended a European-style
gala netting $100,000 for the group's musical education programs for
children.</TE>
<TE>   Held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, the black-tie
benefit attended by about 300 guests featured a classic Viennese
feast--goulash soup, mushroom strudel, roulade of beef and chestnut
bombe. John W. Benecke and Mary Kay VanderMolen were co-chairs of the
March 16 event. Guests included Dean and Kaly Corey, Donald and Karen
Evarts, Gary and Tricia Babick, Deirdre and Doug Smith, Fred and Eva

<LD>Charlie and his robot friend E-1 were cleaning up Charlie's room.</LD>
<LD>   "As soon as I'm done," Charlie said excitedly, "I can go with my
friends to the Underground City."</LD>
<LD>   "May I come, too?" E-1 asked.</LD>
<TE>   "No robots allowed in the Underground City," Charlie reminded him.
"There's so much electricity in the air that you guys always short
out."</TE>
<TE>   "That's right," E-1 said. "I forgot."</TE>
<TE>   A moment later E-1 took the toys and clothes Charlie had already
put away and threw them all over the place. Charlie could never clean
up his room again before all his friends left.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you do that?" Charlie yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want you to go. You're my friend."</TE>
<TE>   As far as Charlie knew, he was E-1's only friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll fix that," Charlie said. He went to the corner of the room
and touched a green button on a big machine. The big machine buzzed
and a door in front opened allowing a boy who looked a lot like
Charlie to step out.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi! I'm Chuck," the new boy said.</TE>
<TE>   "You always are," Charlie said. He'd used the machine to make
electric Chucks before. Each one lasted a few hours and then Charlie
had to put the worn-out hulk into the recycler.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck," Charlie went on, "I want you to play with E-1."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, boy!" Chuck exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent!" E-1 cried.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool!" Charlie said. "Now I can go to the Underground City with
my friends." He looked at Chuck and E-1, who had already settled down
to play with his antigravity blocks. "I mean, with my other friends,"
Charlie added as he put on his jacket and walked toward the door to
his room. "And it would be great if you guys would clean up my room.
I already did it once today."</TE>
<TE>   "Right," E-1 said.</TE>

<HD>Why Excuse Some Steel Dumpers?</HD>
<DH>Bush follows the law, then plays politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>David Friedman, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the New American Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orthodox free traders were stunned by the Bush administration's
recent decision to impose tariffs of 8% to 30% on some steel imports
to protect U.S. producers. But if they read the law the
administration used to justify its action, they would learn that the
industry clearly qualifies for relief under long-standing rules of
international commerce. Still, the Bush administration isn't off the
hook. While correctly acknowledging U.S. steel's plight, it cynically
manipulated the relief package in ways that will neither help the
industry nor restore confidence in world trade.</LD>
<LD>   Under the "safeguard" provisions of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974,
industries that face serious injury from increased imports may
petition the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), a
quasi-judicial federal agency, for temporary protection.
International commercial organizations, such as the World Trade
Organization and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, explicitly recognize such safeguard procedures. Their
purpose is to afford a brief respite to an industry being decimated
by rapid import growth so it can regroup or at least plan for an
orderly decline. U.S. steel presents an almost classic safeguard
situation.</LD>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, after U.S. steel producers invested billions
of dollars in new equipment and technology, the industry was on a
generally solid footing. Larger, less efficient firms had stabilized
their losses. A bevy of ultramodern, sophisticated producers like
mini-mills were reinventing much of the sector.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Asian economies collapsed in 1997. Global demand for
steel products plummeted to 20-year lows. Suddenly, world steel
producers were flocking to market their surplus wares in the United
States, whose economy, driven by the tech-stock bubble, continued to
soar. Low-priced imports became even more of a bargain as the dollar
strengthened against other currencies.</TE>
<TE>   Once healthy U.S. steel producers soon were bleeding red ink.
Since 1998, 31 steel companies have shut down or filed for
bankruptcy. According to American University economist Robert A.
Blecker, the sector's incipient collapse put at risk an estimated
325,000 American jobs and pensions that support as many as 600,000
retired workers and their families.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2001, both the Bush administration and the U.S.
Senate asked the ITC to conduct a safeguard investigation. The
commission's analysis, one of the largest ever completed and sporting
a witness list of more than 100 pages, examined the import history
and evidence of serious harm for 33 separate steel products, or about
75% of total steel imports. In October of that year, the commission's
six members announced they had unanimously found that trade relief
was warranted for 12 products, and that no relief should be granted
for 17 others. The commission deadlocked over the remaining four
products. Several weeks later, it sent its report and recommendations
for tariffs ranging from 20%-40% to the president for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Trade hawks generally decry any form of government intervention,
particularly when the result limits the flow of cheap imports into
the domestic economy. It doesn't matter to them if U.S. producers are
wiped out, so long as prices for the affected products stay low.</TE>
<TE>   But trade laws don't work that way. The rules of global commerce
aren't brushed aside when acts of piracy, theft or extortion, for
example, reduce import prices. Countries have painstakingly
negotiated the conditions under which their citizens are willing to
realize the risks and benefits from exchanging trillions of dollars
of capital and goods worldwide. Once the ITC sent its findings to the
Bush administration, it would have been an unconscionable breach of
faith to take no action.</TE>
<TE>   But that action was shaped by politics. Under the law, for
example, the administration was free to interpret the four ITC tie
votes any way it desired. When the relief measures were announced
earlier this month, it revealed that significant tariffs were to be
applied to only two of the deadlocked products--tin and stainless
wire products, not tool steel or stainless flange items.</TE>
<TE>   Why the difference?</TE>
<TE>   Tin plate products are produced in large numbers in West Virginia,
a state President Bush unexpectedly carried in the last election.
Tool steel and flanges are less geographically concentrated and are
used by other powerful industries, such as autos, that care little
about the health of their U.S. suppliers. Rather than apply the
safeguard laws as broadly as possible, the administration gutted the
relief measures in ways that undermined their effectiveness and
legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, the Bush administration decided to fully exempt
Mexico and Canada, along with a mish-mash of other politically
sensitive nations such as Jordan and Israel, from any protective
tariffs whatsoever. Mexico and Canada alone account for 30% of the
total steel imports found harmful to U.S. producers. The ITC
explicitly held that relief was warranted from Canadian imports in
the case of five steel products and from seven Mexican imports.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful of turmoil in our hemispheric markets, the administration
ignored these findings and imposed the full brunt of the tariffs on a
select group of nations, including China, Japan, South Korea, Ukraine
and Russia. Just why these countries' steel imports, and not those
from other, equally harmful sources should be penalized was never
explained. Given the importance of steel to the economic development
of many former Soviet states, it is difficult to comprehend why
Canadian imports are of no concern while Ukrainian and Russian
imports must be strictly regulated.</TE>
<TE>   These exclusions effectively eliminate many of the tariffs.
Western U.S. producers, for example, were particularly hard hit by
imports of slab steel, a product other manufacturers mill into
finished goods. The administration set a 30% tariff for all imports
above 5.4 million tons.</TE>
<TE>   Imports recently peaked at 7 million tons, however, and Canada and
Mexico accounted for 1.6 million tons of that total. Since imports
from our closest neighbors are exempt, the tariff-trigger point just
happens to coincide with the highest volume of imports in recent
memory. It is highly unlikely any significant protection will be
afforded by this approach.</TE>
<TE>   There remains the question of why the U.S. steel industry is
worthy of subject of trade relief and not the myriad other sectors
that likely also qualify under the law. Premier film-production jobs,
for example, are being shipped to Canada so that Hollywood bigwigs,
most of them ostensibly liberal and pro-labor, can slash employee
costs and receive illegal subsidies. "John Q," a movie that bemoaned
the exodus of U.S. jobs and labor's loss of health benefits, was
filmed in Canada under just such arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   The ITC's report to the president also shows that U.S. aircraft
and parts-production employment fell by 50%, or more than 230,000
jobs, during the last decade, six times the steel industry's
employment losses. Some 90,000 workers lost their jobs in computer
and office-equipment manufacturing during the same period. Much of
these losses were caused by foreign demands that parts production be
shipped overseas as a condition of their buying finished U.S. goods
or result from improper export subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   The administration blundered when it selectively imposed tariffs
on steel imports, but not for the reasons most commonly cited. It is
proper to enforce the agreements under which America has consented to
participate in global commerce. It is worse than not acting at all to
do so in a capricious, indefensible manner. That is, unfortunately,
precisely how the administration chose to make one of the most
important fair trade decisions in recent times.</TE>

<HD>Have You Heard About Osama's Cheez-It Stash?</HD>
<DH>The conspiracy lobby is working to keep rumors alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GALE HOLLAND</AU>
<BD>Gale Holland is a freelance writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an article of faith among some Muslims that Israel and/or the
international Jewish/Zionist cabal were behind the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Tales of "4,000 Jewish
workers" who stayed home Sept. 11, and of Israeli spies videotaping
the twin towers collapsing, were quickly debunked. Still, the stories
persist. Most of us chalk them up to anti-Semitism, denial or
ignorance, and go on our way.</LD>
<LD>   But what about our Sept. 11 fantasies? 9/11--our shorthand for the
attacks, the war, the anthrax scare, rolling terror alerts, the whole
scary mess--has spawned a plethora of tall tales, and some of these
are as kooky as the suddenly ill 4,000 Jewish workers.</LD>
<LD>   The stories started soon after the attacks. By now, you probably
know that the photo of the man on the World Trade Center observation
deck with a jet pointed at his back is a fake. But did you hear that
Osama bin Laden penned a memo to his cave mates, warning them to lay
off his "Cheez-It" stash? Or that a New Yorker found bodies, still
strapped in their airplane seats, inside her lower Manhattan
apartment?</LD>
<TE>   If these stories sound like urban legends, they are. But other
storylines contain just enough truth to keep them in rotation. A year
ago, who would have believed that terrorist "sleeper cells" would
turn commercial jetliners into bombs, obliterating national landmarks
and 3,000 lives in a single coordinated assault? Faced with the
inexplicable, we seem to take comfort in irrational
pseudo-explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Take one of the latest stories making the rounds. This account has
it that U.S. knowledge of terrorist mastermind Bin Laden's murderous
intentions goes all the way back to Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and the
1987 Iran-Contra congressional hearings. North is said to have told a
U.S. Senate committee that Bin Laden threatened to kill him and his
family, prompting him to spend $60,000 on a home-security system.
Then-Sen. Al Gore is supposed to have grilled North on his story
during the Senate hearings on the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Except it was actually terrorist Abu Nidal that North was worried
about, according to the Urban Legends Web site (www.snopes2.com). The
security system cost $16,000, not $60,000. And Gore was not one of
North's interrogators. So much for details.</TE>
<TE>   One clue to the shakiness of the story might have been that North
was convicted of obstruction of Congress, destruction of evidence and
of accepting an illegal gratuity in Iran-Contra, although the
judgments were later overturned. And consider the motive. The
political right has every reason to blame Democrats, and excuse
Republicans, for failing to abort an act of terrorism that, after
all, occurred on the GOP's watch.</TE>
<TE>   But the right is not alone in pushing 9/11 lore that suits its
political agenda. A story that has entranced some on the left
revolves around the sudden departure of Bin Laden's U.S.-based
relatives after 9/11. Reputedly, President Bush bundled the relatives
onto planes two days after the attacks, when the rest of the country
was still barred from the skies and before they could be interrogated
by the FBI, in exchange for some favor from the Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   Two Saudi flights did leave the U.S., but Bush had nothing to do
with the departures, according to the Urban Legends Web site. The
flights, one chartered by the Bin Laden family and the other by the
Saudi government, occurred one week after the attacks, when the
no-flight rule had been lifted. The Saudis say Bin Laden's relatives
were questioned before they left, according to the site.</TE>
<TE>   Another peculiarly American rumor with obvious antecedents is that
Bin Laden is alive and well and living in the U.S. Like Elvis, Osama
keeps popping up all over, although he seems to especially like Utah,
where he is typically seen tucking into a Big Mac and fries at
McDonald's, or window-shopping at the local mall, according to the
Urban Legends site.</TE>
<TE>   A big hit on the e-mail circuit is the "Saucy Jack" letter. Jack
is a U.S. Marine Corps special operations intelligence officer who
writes his friend, "Bizarre," a profane account of his Afghan tour.
The letter includes this account of the Afghan people: "These guys,
all of 'em, are Huns. Actual, living Huns....They have no respect for
anything, not for their families or for each other or for themselves.
They claw at one another as a way of life. They play polo with dead
calves and force their 5-year-old sons into human cockfights to
defend the family honor. Huns, roaming packs of savage, heartless
beasts ...."</TE>
<TE>   The letter's battlefield details, celebration of U.S. prowess and
demonization of the enemy play well in these days of severe Pentagon
reporting restrictions, when we're starved for a soldier's-eye view
of the front. But there's a problem with the letter: In it, Jack
discloses his precise location and mission. Military censors? The
letter's author is unknown, but it certainly looks like a hoax. Its
aim seems to be to discourage scrutiny of military operations,
particularly from CNN and "that awful, sneering, pompous [CNN anchor]
Aaron Brown."</TE>
<TE>   In the misty climes where the far left meets the far right,
conspiracy theories have begun to dominate the 9/11 rumor mill. The
basic premise is that President Bush/ the CIA/ Big Oil either planned
the attacks or let them happen to secure a U.S. oil pipeline/ take
over the Middle East/ launch a one-world government.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the conspiracists, such as former LAPD narcotics
investigator Michael C. Ruppert (www.copvcia.com), offer a timeline
of suspicious-sounding, if unsubstantiated, 9/11 factoids and "let"
the reader decide. Claiming that the CIA met with Bin Laden in July
2001 and allowed him to walk away, Ruppert asks, "If the CIA and the
government weren't involved in the Sept. 11 attacks, what were they
doing?"</TE>
<TE>   Other theorists, including private investigator Joe Vialls, lob
more specific, but equally unsubstantiated, allegations. Vialls, on
his Web site (http://geocities.com/mknemesis/homerun.html) claims
that the jetliners used in the Sept. 11 attacks were "hijacked
electronically" from the ground. Vialls doesn't identify the
culprits, but apparently the plot involves a secret U.S. military
software program developed by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or DARPA, and "the multinationals." The media can be
considered unindicted co-conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   "Many readers might by now be indignant; convinced this is
incorrect or misleading information because of 'those telephone calls
from the hijacked aircraft,'" Vialls' Web site says. "Which telephone
calls exactly? There are no records of any such calls, and the
emotional claptrap the media fed you in the aftermath of the attack
was in all cases third-person."</TE>
<TE>   Shadowy government agencies with Maxwell Smartish-sounding
acronyms are big with these conspiracy theorists. So are credentials
that appear to mean something but don't. Vialls, for example, is
described on his Web site as a "former member of the Society of
Licensed Aeronautical Engineers &amp; Technologists, London."</TE>
<TE>   What Vialls and his ilk really represent is the conspiracy lobby,
a tiny but persistent subgroup spawned by the John F. Kennedy
assassination and nurtured through the CIA/ assassination-plot
scandals of the following decades. They see conspiracies everywhere.
A link on Vialls' site refers to convicted Unabomber Theodore J.
Kaczynski, one of the most thoroughly investigated crime figures on
record, as a "patsy."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, their 9/11 scenarios have won them new followers. Ruppert has
appeared on a Canadian cable television show, and a West Coast
lecture series is underway. David Corn, The Nation magazine's
Washington editor, received so many e-mails from readers alerting him
to dastardly U.S./ CIA 9/11 plots that he decided to debunk them in
print. Now, he's sorry he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I was besieged by people accusing me of being a CIA
disinformation agent," says Corn, referring to the responses to his
story. "In hindsight, it's just not worth it; people who believe in
conspiracies of this nature often can't be argued against. Because
they assume if you argue against them, you're part of the
conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes
fiction is just fiction. Getting at the truth is tough, accepting it
can be harder still. Paranoia is a lot easier. Sept. 11 may have
robbed us of our sense of normalcy, but we can't let it unseat our
reason.</TE>

<AU>PAULA R. NEWBERG</AU>
<BD>Paula R. Newberg is the author of "Politics at the
Heart: The Architecture of International Assistance to Afghanistan."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Any country that endures a long war has plenty to answer for. The
scarred lanes and impromptu roadside graveyards in Kabul, like those
across Afghanistan, tell two decades of stories about violence,
deprivation, heroism and forbearance. Some of these tales will be
included in a highly charged independent commission report on ethnic
killings that Afghan leader Hamid Karzai will release soon. Others
will emerge from a commission on truth that he is committed to
establishing. But in the recounting of human-rights abuses,
Afghanistan's past can derail its future. Afghans are starting down a
long road toward political stability, but without a system to deliver
simple justice, they may be unable to resolve problems that make
political reconciliation possible.</LD>
<LD>   The consequences of old conflicts still tear at the seams of
Afghan society and contribute to an environment of uncertain justice.
As the interim government knows too well, this can easily lead to
more fighting. This is why Karzai insists that Afghanistan cannot
wait to confront its past. Wary observers fear that his frail
government cannot handle revelations of past misconduct. Rights
advocates, however, fear that Afghans cannot create a durable society
without airing grievances and bringing bad actors to justice. Both
may be right.</LD>
<TE>   Take the problem of fair trials. Last month, the minister of civil
aviation and tourism, Abdul Rahman, was killed during an altercation
at Kabul airport. Some blame impatient religious pilgrims whose
flight to Mecca never arrived; others believe he was the target of a
political vendetta. Karzai quickly accused rival Cabinet members of
conspiracy to murder Rahman and declared that they would stand trial
under the Afghan constitution. The Cabinet members have denied
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   But whose court, which laws, whose statutes, which constitution?
Like many countries in political transition, Afghanistan does not yet
have a fully functioning justice system. The December Bonn agreement
that empowers Karzai and lays out a route to a future government
revived the 1964 constitution, but it doesn't specify what will
replace the outdated monarchy or how the fragmented Cabinet will get
along. Three months into his six-month term, Karzai can sign
treaties, entice international donors and choose judges, yet even
with billions of dollars in aid pledges, he can't establish the
conditions that will make justice accessible to all Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   If fair laws and courts are not accessible--for every Afghan, not
just for Rahman's alleged killers--just imagine how difficult it will
be to air charges against human-rights abusers. Every individual who
exposes dangerous truths about people in power takes a personal risk;
so do judges who hear their grievances. In countries far more stable
than Afghanistan, truth and reconciliation commissions have been
frustrating and occasionally dangerous. In Latin America, where
courts helped restore democracy, public accusations of rights
violations by prominent persons sometimes led to murder. South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was an essential part of
its transition to majority rule, but even there, communities
committed to fundamental change learned bitter lessons about trusted
political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Even simple justice is hard to guarantee. In neighboring Pakistan
and Kyrgyzstan, courts are often used for retribution, and
journalists and witnesses die. In places as different as Argentina,
Chile and East Timor, experience has shown that political and social
reconciliation happens only when citizens feel confident that their
government can protect them. Afghanistan--where war continues,
ordinary crime is rising and armed men take pot shots at
international peacekeepers on Kabul's street corners--may find that
it is too soon to incur the high cost of political retrospection.</TE>
<TE>   Fostering a climate of accountability is a fine idea, but the
order of business needs to be reversed. First, build the state, then
judge its past. Create a plausible political process to establish the
bona fides of those who seek to rule. Protect vigilantly the right to
question--and do so by ensuring that universal-rights protections are
enshrined in law.</TE>
<TE>   The prerequisites for confronting Afghanistan's past lie in the
country that Afghanistan can become. It can best face risks by
recreating a state in the image of its aspirations--a functioning
civil service, credible judges, and representative political
institutions that make it possible for Afghans to take a leap of
faith out of the morass of war toward something that resembles peace.</TE>
<TE>   This is the chance that the Bonn agreement, imperfect though its
solutions are, offer Afghanistan. Karzai will soon have to decide how
to deal with prisoners of war, respond to U.S. courts hearing cases
against the Taliban, and cooperate with international courts and U.S.
military tribunals that will be convened to judge members of Al
Qaeda. His hands will be strengthened if Afghanistan makes local
justice the first building block of its renewed state.</TE>
<TE>   Justice is a looking glass that refracts the past by framing the
future. More than 20 million Afghans have the right to see justice
done, and even more, to live in a place where speaking about the
future gives memory its voice.</TE>

<BD>Kevin Phillips' next book, "Wealth and Democracy: A
Political History of the American Rich," will be published in May.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Committee for the Direction of the American Economy--sticklers
know it as the Federal Reserve Board--met last week and declared
itself satisfied with the resurrection of national prosperity.
Unfortunately, this provides only marginal comfort, because a
possible roller-coaster economy may take Americans for a double-dip
recession ride in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three decades, under the ever more prominent
guidance of the Fed, the U.S. business cycle has developed a
little-understood quirkiness. Recessions aren't over when they're
announced to be, and two downturns--one in the 1970s, the other in
the 1980s--became spine-tingling double-dips. To add to the risks of
2002-2004, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 76 and wearying, may retire
and be replaced by a minimally credentialed person few Americans have
heard of.</LD>
<LD>   Fed meetings now command as much media attention as a presidential
press conference, a celebrity unimaginable 40 years ago. Few citizens
back then knew or cared about chairmen like William McChesney Martin
(1951-70) or G. William Miller (1978-79). By contrast, the Fed chiefs
since the late 1970s, Paul A. Volcker and Greenspan, have become
household names, and their position is often called the nation's
second most powerful.</LD>
<TE>   This is partly because deregulation of interest rates and finance
during the 1970s, '80s and '90s, along with the floating of
international currency rates, has made the Fed's job of managing the
money supply a lot more complicated--and also a lot more
determinative of the ups and downs of the U.S. economy. Central banks
in other nations have also gained clout, but none can hold a candle
to the U.S. Fed. Fellow central-bank chiefs treat Greenspan with a
deference the College of Cardinals reserves for the pope.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's new global role is more than paralleled by its firmer
hold on the U.S. economy, but that has not meant it can better
predict when recessions are over. Take the bad downturns in the early
1970s and 1980s. Both, in a sense, came in two separate stages. The
recession of 1970-71 staged the economic equivalent of a second
coming in late 1973. The recession in early 1980 had barely abated
when a new downturn developed in the second half of 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Important interconnections support the two-stage thesis. In 1971
and then again in early 1980, moderate recessions were underway
largely because the Fed had raised interest rates to cool the
overheated economy. Both White Houses became nervous because the
presidential elections of 1972 and 1980 were on the horizon. The Fed,
in turn, was just a telephone summons away. So, each time, a newly
appointed chairman--Arthur F. Burns in 1971-72, Volcker in
1980--gunned monetary policy, accelerating the economy out of looming
election-year doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble was, these revs added a powerful stimulus and renewed
inflation; interest rate hikes resumed and new recessions began in
1973 and in 1981. Moreover, each of these follow-up recessions was a
humdinger, deeper than their lead-ins.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990-91, Fed policy shaped a different kind of recession--short
for the big hitters in the financial markets, drawn out for the folks
in convenience stores. The Fed and the economics profession said the
recession ended in spring 1991, when gross domestic product and the
stock market rebounded. Main Street knew better. Federal data showed
that white-collar unemployment continued to rise, peaking in 1993,
two years after recovery supposedly began. Ross Perot's third-party
presidential candidacy bid tapped a real economic frustration and
helped drive George Bush out of the White House in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   This history suggests that what's a recession, and what isn't, has
become increasingly blurred and debatable. More and more, the
yardsticks reflect a finance-weighted economy, not a goods-producing
one. Besides, that's what the Fed represents--finance, in general,
and banking, in particular.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, you see, isn't a regular government agency. It's a
hybrid, partly controlled by the U.S. government and partly by the
banking industry. The Federal Open Market Committee, the body that
votes to expand or shrink the nation's money supply, includes a
number of regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents who are selected
by district boards, on which bankers sit.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists find this a damning conflict of interest. Milton
Friedman, a 1976 Nobel laureate, complained a decade ago that banking
is a "major sector of the economy in which no enterprise ever fails,
no one ever goes broke. That's because the banks have been the
constituency of the Federal Reserve." Labor halls, Main Streets and
suburban subdivisions don't rank as high.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy has also dogged Greenspan's recent years at the
economic helm. Did he get us out of the recession in 2001-2002? Did
he first get us into it in 2000? Or did he do both? There's no doubt
that the Fed's 11 rate cuts in 2001, a record, gave the economy just
about its biggest hot shot ever. Bank profits soared, but
manufacturing crumbled, and goods-producing America still has one leg
in the dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   History, alas, suggests that the piper still has to be paid for
the Fed's unprecedented stimulus. Stage two has yet to be felt.
Conceivably, 2002 and 2003 could resemble 1991 and 1992--a weak
"recovery" period, during which the GDP remains in positive territory
because of finance, while unemployment continues to drift higher.</TE>
<TE>   But a double-dip recession along the lines of the 1970-75 or
1980-83 pattern is attracting more attention. Each, with some
oversimplification, can be described as a mild recession followed 12
to 24 months later by a deep recession.</TE>
<TE>   Could it happen again? Conceivably. Savvy Wall Street advisory
groups have dug into their economic histories and report that a quick
double-dip--a return to recession this summer, say--is probably
impossible. No down quarter has been recorded during the first year
after a recession all the way back to 1954, excluding 1980.</TE>
<TE>   But this is less reassuring than it may first appear. Official
data have already put the fourth quarter of 2001 back in the economic
growth column. Thus, by September 2002, the recovery would be 1 year
old, expiring the assurances from past experience. And the stock
market, remember, is described by analysts as looking some six to
nine months ahead. By that chronology, any perception of a double-dip
beginning in early 2003 could start to pull the market down as early
as next month.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics suggest that another downturn is almost inevitable, because
the one just passed has left record consumer debt more swollen than
ever, the real-estate bubble untouched and stock price-to-earnings
ratios at unsafe heights. As for inflation triggering interest-rate
hikes, some economists say that the best predictive measure--the
median Consumer Price Index--is already running at a worrisome
average of 4% for 2002. The bond market has begun to price in future
rate hikes, boosting long-term rates. Such circumstances make a
double-dip in 2003 quite believable.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the next few years are likely to have some
unprecedented follow-through economic contortions, which may help
explain the new talk about Greenspan considering retirement. He most
likely wants to quit while he's ahead, and he's got a respectable
reason. The problem is, there are no obvious high-powered GOP
successors.</TE>
<TE>   The two most credible choices, former Clinton Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin and William McDonough, president of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, are both Democrats. The Republicans are talking
about John Taylor, U.S. Treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, who is barely known in politics and government, and White
House economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey, who suffers from too much
politics and too many Enron connections.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably essential for Greenspan to stay, despite his age and
despite the possible roller-coaster ride ahead. Otherwise, besides
worrying about unusual economic after-effects, we--and the rest of
the world--might also have to worry about a U.S. economy being run by
a new Fed chairman hardly anyone has ever heard of.</TE>

<DH>The poorest Indians suffer from too little globalization.</DH>

<AU>SAM QUINONES</AU>
<BD>Sam Quinones is the author of "True Tales From Another
Mexico: The Lynch Mob, the Popsicle Kings, Chalino and the Bronx."</BD>
<DL>BOCHIL, Mexico</DL>
<LD>In this town in the highlands of Chiapas, the coffee-bean buyers are
easy to spot. Their two-story concrete houses, complete with garages
and metal doors, occupy half a city block. The homes of the Indian
peasants who grow the coffee are adobe. And therein lies an
unexpected story.</LD>
<LD>   The Indian peasants have no access to world coffee markets other
than through the local buyers in Bochil. As a result, they are
financially abused. Captive and poor, they pay for life's essentials
by indebting themselves to loan sharks who abound near here.</LD>
<LD>   I went to Bochil recently to meet the members of a coffee
cooperative, known as Mut Vitz, that was formed two years ago by 650
Indian peasant growers to break the stranglehold of the local coffee
buyers. Mut Vitz--"Bird Mountain" in the Tzotzil Indian language--has
a small office, warehouse and packaging operation. But it still
exports less than 10% of the 950 tons of coffee beans it produces
annually.</LD>
<TE>   All that would change if Mut Vitz had what it covets above all
else--an Internet connection. Coffee buyers in other countries pay up
to five times more than the buyers in Bochil do, but Mut Vitz can't
contact them cheaply. Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, the former
state monopoly, says that connecting the Indian cooperative to a
major city that has Internet service wouldn't be profitable. So, the
closest Internet connection is two hours away, in San Cristobal de
las Casas, Chiapas' former capital.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 1, 1994, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement
went into effect, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN)
rebelled not far from Bochil. Protesting the abject poverty in which
millions of Mexican Indians live, the EZLN in part blamed
globalization for the Indians' sad fate. But the case of Mut Vitz
demonstrates that, if anything, Mexico's Indians suffer from too
little globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Globalization is connectivity to the world chiefly through
technology and open markets. Its basic tools are literacy,
electricity, roads, airports, telecommunications and the Internet.
The Indians in Bochil, as do their counterparts in the rest of
Mexico, have none of these. They are victims of centuries of
disinvestment in education, communication and transportation--the
essentials of connectivity.</TE>
<TE>   Globalization has thrown into brutal relief just how isolated
Mexico's Indians are. Some still live in areas that are accessible
only by small aircraft on clear days. Many Indian villages are hours
by foot from schools and health clinics.</TE>
<TE>   These are obvious signs of isolation, but the less obvious ones
are no less pernicious.</TE>
<TE>   On my way to Bochil, I met Juan Manuel Perez, a 22-year-old
Tzotzil Indian. He is a student at the Center for Full Indian
Development, a private vocational school in San Cristobal de las
Casas. Perez's goal is to learn how to type, a skill that rivals that
of reading and writing in today's high-tech economy. No one in
Perez's village knows how to type. So, he spends half his day at the
center in front of a sticky manual typewriter, a towel draped over
his hands and the keys, copying government documents for practice.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every student who arrives at the center doesn't know how to
type. Many can't read or write. Some don't know how to drive a car.
The school also offers courses in baking, weaving, farming and animal
husbandry because the Indians' knowledge in these traditional
activities is so paltry.</TE>
<TE>   This lack of basic knowledge is also the bane of the Mut Vitz
coffee cooperative. Only two of the co-op's members know how to use
e-mail. Andres Diaz, 19, and Mariano Gonzales, 21, both sons of
coffee growers, take computer training one day a month as money
permits. Web site design remains a total mystery to these young men.</TE>
<TE>   Improving Indians' economic lot has become a major theme of
Vicente Fox's administration, Congress and Indian and human-rights
groups. The Mexican president has proposed an ambitious
infrastructure-building program, known as Plan Puebla-Panama, to
connect the most isolated and poorest communities in Mexico's
southeastern states, where the country's largest Indian population
lives, to seven Central American countries. It's unclear where the
money to pay for all the roads, bridges, airports and telephone lines
will come from, but few doubt the need for such an undertaking.</TE>
<TE>   Much smaller-scaled efforts are already underway. In Chiapas,
Margarito Ruiz, coordinator of the National Indigenous Assembly for
Autonomy, shops for science and engineering scholarships to award his
Indian students. Eleven of them are in Havana studying medicine on
Cuban government scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are malnourished and shoeless, that's poverty. It's
not Indian culture," said Ruiz, a Tojolabal Maya Indian. "A strong
society that uses cars and planes strengthens its identity because it
has time to think how to develop its identity. It isn't thinking
constantly how it's going to feed itself or its children who are
dying."</TE>
<TE>   Indian doctors or computer technicians? For many Mexicans, those
are strange notions. Mexicans often imagine Indians as colorful
repositories of national culture--folks trapped in time and natural
habitat. But geographic and intellectual isolation is a recipe for
cultural decline and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, most Indians face two fates: subsistence farming
or, when that fails, selling gum on the streets of Mexico City. If
globalization is allowed to reach the highlands of Chiapas, and if
the Indians there and elsewhere in Mexico are given the opportunity
to learn its tools, those alternatives will dramatically multiply.
Indian economic self-determination, as with Mut Vitz, may only be an
Internet connection away.</TE>

<BD>George Salem is chairman of the board of directors of
the Arab American Institute. Marvin Lender is chairman of the
executive committee of the Israel Policy Forum.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As an Arab American and an American Jew, we usually react quite
differently to news from the Middle East. One of us is more
sympathetic to the Palestinians, the other to the Israelis. We
disagree on which side bears more responsibility for the current
carnage, and our anger is often directed at different parties to the
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, we have identical, appalled reactions to the
images from the region that bombard us from our TV screens. The
pictures--whether they depict Israelis or Palestinians--are too
horrible to bear: pregnant mothers delivering children even after
they have been shot; a bewildered and bloodied young man standing
amid the rubble of a shattered coffee shop; mourners wailing in the
universal language of grief; three-foot long coffins for children
whose lives were cut short because grown-ups could not resolve their
differences.</LD>
<TE>   It is tempting for us, like others in our respective communities
here in the U.S., to fall back on familiar, furious pronouncements of
who has been more wronged and why the U.S. should lean on and
pressure the other side. But, as we reel from the TV images, we think
it is time for Arabs and Jews in the U.S. to change course. If we
truly care about friends and relatives we know in Israel and the
Palestinian territories, now is the time to set aside our traditional
differences and unite behind the U.S. government's efforts to stave
off utter disaster in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Vice President Dick Cheney has returned from his Mideast
diplomatic mission, and U.S. Middle East envoy Anthony C. Zinni is
continuing his tireless efforts to restore stability in the
Israeli-Palestinian arena, we should tell the Bush administration,
passionately and vocally, that it is the only glimmer of hope for a
sustained end to the violence. It is painfully clear that Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon cannot reach an agreement on their own. Israelis and
Palestinians cannot seem to stop themselves from escalating both
violence and hatred. Unless the United States steps in, they will
fight until one brings the other down or, more likely, until they
bring each other down.</TE>
<TE>   As Americans with special connections to the peoples of the Middle
East, we should take advantage of our perspectives to try to
influence the direction of U.S. policy in a new way. Rather than
trying to score political points inside the Beltway at the expense of
each other's positions, Arab and Jewish Americans should have one
position: support for the administration when it calls on both sides
to make the painful but necessary compromises for stability and
peace. It would be wrong and unrealistic for the U.S. to try to
impose its will on either party. But viable, substantive negotiations
will not be possible unless the administration presses both Israel
and the Palestinian Authority to end violence, take political risks
and build mutual confidence. This will undoubtedly mean concrete and
potentially difficult measures, like adhering to the Mitchell plan's
ideas of halting Israeli settlement expansion and Palestinian
incitement against the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is sometimes rancor and bitterness between
our communities, as there is between Arabs and Jews in the Middle
East. However, while putting aside partisan squabbling and working
together for the same foreign-policy goals is not easy for either of
us, it is essential. But our doubts and reservations are assuaged
when we see those horrible images of the current conflict on the
evening news.</TE>
<TE>   And we are also motivated by other terrifying images, particularly
the ones that linger in our minds from Sept. 11: the planes colliding
into New York City skyscrapers, the firemen weeping over lost
colleagues, the daily photos in the morning paper of people
slaughtered for the "crime" of being Americans. These, too, are
reasons why both our communities should endorse balanced, even-handed
Middle East diplomacy by the administration. It is not only our
Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters who need this kind of
diplomacy: We Americans urgently need successful diplomacy as well,
because ending Palestinian-Israeli violence and political stalemate
is a vital element of the war on the terrorists who threaten our
country.</TE>
<TE>   Unless there is progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, it will be much more difficult for the U.S. to sustain a
global anti-terror coalition that includes Arab and other Muslim
states. The willing participation of those states will be
particularly vital if the U.S. aggressively takes on other Mideast
extremists who threaten American lives. That is why Cheney's mission
to drum up support for expanding the war on terror and combating
weapons of mass destruction occurs simultaneously with more intensive
U.S. involvement on the Israel-Palestinian front. These objectives
are vital to the country we share, as well as the other region of the
world we care so deeply about.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the dire emergency facing Palestinians and Israelis,
regardless of the need to protect American lives, there will be those
in our communities who undoubtedly will be unhappy if the U.S.
proposes formulas that neither party prefers but both can live with
in order to end this bloody nightmare. But too many lives are at
stake for parochial politics and business as usual. The current U.S.
initiative faces daunting odds and may well not make the picture any
more positive in the Middle East, but it deserves the wholehearted
support of every American.</TE>

<DH>Defying the shackles of gravity is a dream enshrined in
myth and the human psyche. Now NASA will test a machine to determine
if it is also real science.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET WERTHEIM</AU>
<BD>Margaret Wertheim is curating a show on the work of
"outsider physicist" James Carter, at the Santa Monica Museum of Art,
opening April 20. In Carter's theory of physics, gravity does not
exist at all.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laws are made to be broken. Or so the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration seems to think. After an almost two-year wait, the
agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., is poised
to take delivery of a machine that proponents hope will counteract
the laws of gravity.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of the device is a purported effect so radical it
could change the way we interact with one of nature's most
fundamental forces. We're talking revolution, not evolution. A
revolution in spaceships would be just one spinoff. Back here on
Earth, the internal combustion engine could become an endangered
species, replaced by gravity-powered cars, planes and elevators.</LD>
<LD>   The dream of defying gravity has a long and ignoble history. From
Icarus on, the road is littered with failed attempts to unbind our
feet from the shackles of nature's most seemingly inexorable force.
But the team behind the NASA project say they are basing their
efforts on real science, and NASA has paid almost $600,000 to have
the machine custom-built by Ohio-based Superconductive Components,
Inc. (SCI), a company that specializes in high-tech ceramics and
superconducting materials. Says SCI Vice President James R. Gaines
Jr.: "If it works, what a hoot!"</LD>
<TE>   Revolutions are usually bloody affairs, and this one is no
exception. Many physicists believe the whole project is a waste of
time based on unsubstantiated research of dubious origin. Gravity,
they contend, is in no danger of diminution--the only thing they see
at stake is NASA's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The story begins soberly enough, in the pages of the respected
science journal Physica C. There, in 1992, Russian physicist Evgeny
Podkletnov published the results of an experiment in which he claimed
to have discovered a "gravity-shielding" effect. According to the
article, Podkletnov had managed to reduce the force of gravity on a
small object by up to 2%--in effect, he had reduced its weight. Now
2% may not sound like much, but to the physics community, it was like
a bomb blast. The law of gravity is one of science's most sacrosanct
principles; any breaching of its walls would represent a major threat
to the current theoretical framework. If verified, such a finding
would bag its discoverer a Nobel Prize.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the rub: Podkletnov's paper was hazy on the details. He
worried that his ideas would be taken by others, that he would not be
given proper credit, and he refused to allow anyone into his lab to
see his apparatus. Incomplete disclosure, coupled with the outlandish
nature of the claim itself, left most physicists scoffing with
derision. As a result, Podkletnov was thrown out of his job at the
Tampere University of Technology in Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Since his paper appeared a decade ago, Podkletnov says, many
people have successfully replicated his results, but if so, they have
yet to report them in a peer-reviewed journal. All those who have
published have failed to detect any clear results. One of them is
Marshall Space Flight Center researcher Ron Koczor, who spent two
years investigating various aspects of Podkletnov's experiments, and
eventually gave up. But Podkletnov insists the gravity-shielding
effect only occurs when all the experimental conditions are precisely
right. Koczor decided it was a job for the professionals, and in 1999
he persuaded NASA to commission SCI to build a facsimile of
Podkletnov's original apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   The details might be sketchy, but the basic idea behind the device
is fairly simple. It begins with a disc, about six inches in diameter
and a quarter of an inch thick, made out of a superconducting
material whose recipe Podkletnov has carefully kept secret. The disc
is cooled to below -233 degrees centigrade and levitated using a
magnetic field. Then an electric field is applied to make the disc
spin. So far, all we have is a variation on an electric motor, but
Podkletnov claims that when the disc rotates at more than 5,000
revolutions per minute, an object placed above it begins to lose
weight. Somehow, he says, the force of gravity is being
counteracted--the trick is, you have to get the setup exactly right.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it was as simple as baking a cake," says SCI's Gaines.
Even with the company's expertise it has not been easy. Indeed, the
project is a year behind schedule. But Gaines says his team are
almost there, and they should be handing over the device to NASA
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Will it work? Gaines' technicians are not gravity experts; their
field is materials science. They have simply built the machine to
agreed specifications. But, of course, they would be thrilled if it
did work; success would ensure an enormous boost to superconducting
research. Testing of the device will be NASA's responsibility, and he
awaits their results with great expectation.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I am thrilled to hear my tax dollars are hard at work
subverting the laws of nature. Or attempting to, at any rate. Who
knows what conceptual mountains we might demolish if our imaginations
aim high enough? Johannes Kepler, the founding father of modern
astrophysics, saw science as a form of play--empirical data set an
irrevocable boundary to this play, but within its arena the
imagination must be free to roam.</TE>
<TE>   This is not NASA's first attempt to look for the Podkletnov
effect. Last year, Marshall Space Flight Center funded a different
experiment in which a very sensitive Cavendish balance was used to
try and detect a change of weight in a superconducting apparatus.
Results of that study were "inconclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Randall Peters, a physicist at Mercer University in Macon, Ga.,
was a consultant to that project--he helped to customize the balance
for this unorthodox use. "My own position," Peters says, "is that I'd
be greatly surprised if the effect being sought was actually found."
Like most physicists, he feels confident that gravity will withstand
the Podkletnov test. Nonetheless, he adds that "physics is full of
surprises," and he believes that scientists need to maintain an open
mind. Gaines agrees, defending NASA's willingness to go out on such a
speculative limb: "The upside potential is so huge, they really
couldn't afford to miss out if it is true."</TE>
<TE>   NASA's interest in circumventing gravity is not theoretical. The
agency is reaching for the stars. Literally. Even in the zero-gravity
environment of outer space, you still need to accelerate a ship to
extremely high speeds to get to the stars in any viable framework,
something that cannot be done with conventional rocket technology.
The Podkletnov effect suggests it may be possible to effectively
reduce the mass of the ship, thereby reducing the overall energy
needed for acceleration.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the July paper introduced their experimental
analysis with a wistful discussion on the limitations of rocket
propulsion. "Using current rocket technology," they note, "a trip to
the next star would easily consume the mass-energy equivalent of a
planet in order to arrive within a reasonable lifetime." Technologies
like nuclear fission and fusion offer some hope, "but still will not
support the 'Star Trek' vision of space exploration." In short, if we
are serious about space travel, we need a quantum leap forward in
propulsive power.</TE>
<TE>   Investigating potential options is the task of NASA's Breakthrough
Propulsion Physics Project, which funded last year's Cavendish
balance experiment. Then headed by aerospace engineer Marc G. Millis,
the BPP group has license to boldly go where no man has gone
before--to the outermost limits of current scientific understanding.
Speaking by phone from his office at the John H. Glenn Research
Center in Ohio, Millis insists that "we're not asking anyone to
develop a warp drive." NASA understands, he says, that this is going
to take time, and he stresses that they are "interested in
developments of short increments." Giant spikes of speculation are to
be sheathed in favor of careful step-by-step progress.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the BPP is seeking projects that can be feasibly
achieved in two to three years. Already, the office has funded five
projects that investigate anomalous physical effects. Most do not
deal with gravity per se; as Millis notes, "modifying gravity" is
just one possible direction from which to approach the propulsion
problem. The group has also funded work on reducing the effect of
inertial mass, on quantum tunneling and on the relationship between
electromagnetism and space-time. Well aware of the threat to NASA's
reputation, he is determined to encourage only the most clean-cut
suitors, people with university affiliations and the like.</TE>
<TE>   But lightness of being is a dream that transcends institutional
boundaries and beyond the ivory towers of academe an unheralded army
of amateurs are beavering away in their basements against the
unbearable restraints of Isaac Newton's laws. Go online and the
virtual ether fizzes with a thousand competing propulsion systems.
James Cox, editor of AntiGravity News, lists no less than seven major
classifications of anti-gravity devices, from those based on
superconductivity, to those that exploit properties of gyroscopes and
purported anomalies in nuclear physics or quantum mechanics. Cox
himself is working on an anti-gravity backpack that he claims is
nearing the patent stage. He is currently seeking funding to develop
a commercially viable prototype.</TE>
<TE>   When the BPP's next casting call goes out in the fall, Millis says
the agency will keep an open mind. The message of history, he says,
is that new insights can come from the most seemingly unlikely
directions. By definition, no one can predict from whence the next
revolution will arise. Gentleman, start your engines.</TE>

<HD>Steps to Take When Deposit Isn't Returned</HD>

<AU>H. MAY SPITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several readers have contacted me with a surprisingly common problem.
They've moved out after giving proper notice, left the place decent
and yet their deposit is nowhere in sight. The required 21 days had
come and gone, and so, they feared, had their entire security
deposit.</LD>
<LD>   What if the owner does not return your security deposit? Before
you descend into deposit despair, here are some tips that may get
your deposit back to where it belongs.</LD>
<LD>   Start with the obvious. Believe it or not, lots of folks move out
and forget to give a forwarding address to their landlord. With the
flurry of finding a new place and moving, many tenants simply move
and forget the forwarding address.</LD>
<TE>   So what is the landlord's obligation for tracking you down? None.
The landlord is required to mail the deposit letter to the tenant's
last known address. If you haven't left a forwarding address, guess
where the letter gets mailed? To the address of the place you just
moved from. Why? It's your last known address.</TE>
<TE>   Don't landlords have to take the time to call your nearest
relative as listed on your application? No. Just to mail the itemized
letter within 21 days of your departure to your last known address.</TE>
<TE>   One reader was still waiting for his deposit for more than a
month. After catching up to the manager, she indicated it was sent
registered mail. Sure enough, the postcard notifying the tenant was
overlooked, and the deposit letter was sitting at the post office,
collecting dust.</TE>
<TE>   It's always good to start with the source. Whoever collected the
rent is the first source to reach. Ideally, drop by the management
office during business hours. If not, call the manager and in a
nonconfrontational tone simply say, "Hi, this is John Q. Public, did
I give you my new address? Let me give it to you again. I moved out
three weeks ago, and haven't received my deposit letter and check
yet."</TE>
<TE>   Keep the tone light. Be sure to leave your area code and phone
number plus the best time you can be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Is your deposit gone? Or forgotten? You'd be amazed at how many
owners are ignorant of the law and have no idea the time limit
exists. Some landlords get busy with the move-out and re-rental
details and are still making a list and checking it twice. Other
landlords have confessed they simply forgot to send the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a new manager or owner takes over and assumes the
previous party paid the deposit. In a recent e-mail, a reader worried
that an unsent deposit was sold with the building. Turned out the
seller thought the new owner paid out the deposit and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, all deposit moneys are documented and transferred (or
credited to the price) at the close of escrow to the new owner.
Deposit money remains with the property until paid back to you when
you depart.</TE>
<TE>   Still no luck? Nowhere to drop by? No return call? And you've
tried for several days? Time to get some ink involved. Write a
request letter to the landlord, stating your name, address of the
property where the deposit is owed, deposit amount, move-out date and
your new forwarding address. Include something to the effect of,
"Please reply by the following date [insert a date] so I can be sure
you received this letter. If I don't hear from you by that date, you
leave me no choice but to possibly file a lawsuit in Small Claims
Court."</TE>
<TE>   Keep a copy of the request. Send it where you normally sent the
rent.</TE>
<TE>   Still no response? It's rare, but some owners actually don't
return deposits. The Small Claims Court system was made for this type
of situation. No lawyers or fancy suits, simply a place where anyone
can go to explain the situation to an impartial judge and hopefully
get a fair shake. The court limit for claims is $5,000. Be sure to
pick the court that is in the jurisdiction of the apartment itself.
Check the front of your phone book under County Government, Municipal
Courts, Civil Division, for a direct phone number.</TE>

<HD>Acid Stain Adds Color, Appeal to Concrete</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently, we heard about an attractive floor finish called "acid
stain," which is applied directly over a previously unfinished
concrete slab. It's said to be easy to care for.</LD>
<LD>   Acid stain is not paint or a coating agent. It's a coloring
process involving a chemical reaction on a cementitious material. A
solution made with water, acid and inorganic salts reacts with
minerals in the concrete. The result of this reaction is color.</LD>
<LD>   It works well on new or old concrete. Acid stain is a durable
product if properly protected with sealer or wax, and it can be
applied to interior and exterior surfaces.</LD>
<TE>   The appeal of acid stain is that it gives concrete a mottled,
variegated, marble-like look. It creates beautiful colors on
concrete, mostly earth-tone browns, reddish browns and greens. You
can also create your own shades by mixing and matching available
colors, or applying them at different rates.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect acid stain to be uniform or have an even tone. You'll
get different reactions from slab to slab, and even on the same job
you might see different color patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Acid stain can be applied to walks, entrances, driveways, living
rooms, bathrooms, patios, high-traffic areas, and even vertically to
any cementitious surface. But not every concrete floor is suitable
for acid stain.</TE>
<TE>   Although age is not an issue, condition is. A smooth concrete
surface will yield more attractive results than an old, worn one. If
the concrete is broken, the aggregate (sand or pebbles) is exposed or
has previously been acid-etched, the stain might not take and will
not achieve the desired look.</TE>
<TE>   Aggregate does not react with the stain--only materials in the
concrete paste do. On some applications where the surface is
textured, as in stamped concrete or stamped overlays, acid stain
provides more depth of color, greater finish choices and a more
realistic look to the surface. Don't be in a hurry to patch cracks;
they add interest to the design and finish.</TE>
<TE>   Preparation for acid staining will depend on the condition of the
slab. In the case of new concrete, the only thing needed is to allow
time for curing (at least four weeks after being poured), and some
rinsing and scrubbing. Do not acid wash before acid staining.</TE>
<TE>   For old concrete, a thorough cleaning is necessary. Surface
contaminants such as curing agents, glue, sealers, waxes, paint, oil,
dirt, water repellents and anything that will prevent stain
penetration must be removed. Degrease the floor and check for water
absorption.</TE>
<TE>   Water beads indicate the presence of a contaminant and the floor
must be treated again until the concrete readily absorbs water. When
rinsing and cleaning an interior floor, use a wet vac to avoid runoff
and to prevent staining adjacent areas. It is always a good idea to
first try a small test area.</TE>
<TE>   Because the stain contains acid, it is dangerous to work with.
Extreme caution should be used when working with acid stain. Wear eye
protection and rubber gloves, have plenty of ventilation and follow
the manufacturer's directions to the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Acid stain application involves few tools. All that is needed are
assorted brushes and sprayers to apply acid stain--1-quart spray
bottles and 1-gallon to 2-gallon pump sprayers will do fine. Use
equipment with no metal parts. Shake container before use and fill
sprayers. Apply in a nonuniform way, making sure you wet the entire
area and follow up immediately with a brush. Using the brush, work
the stain into the concrete in a circular motion to add to the random
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Varying degrees of fizzing will occur in different areas, and
color might not show right away. The process involves a chemical
reaction and some colors react slower than others. Apply throughout
the entire area. Let the stain dry and then apply a second coat in
the same manner.</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to create a design or pattern, you'll need a saw with
a diamond blade in it for scoring the surface. Score lines add a new
dimension to acid stain; they provide a natural barrier between
colors and create more eye-catching designs.</TE>
<TE>   Use a 4-inch and 7-inch saw with diamond blades. Mark the lines
with chalk, and cut to a depth of about one-quarter inch, being
careful not to over-cut corners or to miss the lines. Use the 4-inch
saw for small detail and the larger saw for long, straight lines.</TE>
<TE>   After the acid stain has dried, the surface must be scrubbed and
neutralized. Using a medium-stiffness brush, apply a mixture of water
and baking soda to the surface and gently brush the entire area.
Rinse thoroughly with clean water.</TE>
<TE>   Once the floor is completely dry, apply two coats of clear
non-yellowing sealer and/or wax. Consult your supplier about types of
sealer to use for interior or exterior applications and for
instructions on how and when to apply wax.</TE>
<TE>   The decorative concrete busi- ness has been growing rapidly over
the last few years, and acid stain has been a big part of this
growth. More contractors are learning to apply it, and more
homeowners, architects and designers are asking for it.</TE>

<HD>Popcorn Ceilings Looking a Little Stale?</HD>
<DH>Homeowners are removing the sprayed-on surfaces for a
smooth look.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN MORELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do you get the feeling it's 1975 when you walk into your house? The
gold swag lamps and the mirror-tiled walls were replaced ages ago,
but when you look up, are you in the disco era?</LD>
<LD>   It's those acoustic ceilings. Also known as "popcorn" or "cottage
cheese" ceilings because of their rough surface, these sprayed-on
textures were a staple of California home building in the 1950s and
'60s, when developers couldn't build houses fast enough for postwar
buyers.</LD>
<LD>   The term "acoustic" came about because, theoretically, the uneven
surface prevents room echoes. But while that's been debatable, there
were more tangible reasons for the popularity of acoustics.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to understand that acoustic ceilings were a great
innovation when they were introduced," said Charlie Christian, a
longtime Chatsworth plastering contractor who remembers the days when
smooth ceilings weren't so smooth. "Plaster ceilings developed cracks
over time. These looked bad when they were left alone, and they often
looked worse when the homeowner tried to repair them."</TE>
<TE>   Coating the ceiling with plaster and gypsum mixed with tiny pieces
of Styrofoam to give it texture seemed to be the solution. Not only
didn't it crack, but it also saved builders the labor costs of having
plasterers do finish work on ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after drywall became commonly used for ceilings, which
eliminated the cracking problem, builders still made the ceilings
acoustic," Christian said. "It was what people in the 1950s, '60s and
even the '70s expected in a new home."</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, the acoustic ceiling is as chic as a mirror ball.</TE>
<TE>   "People want smooth ceilings nowadays, especially on a home
they've just bought and they're moving into," said Christina Lanzone
of Pacific Acoustic Ceilings in Long Beach. "But you should be aware
of what's involved before jumping in and hiring someone to smooth
them out."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest issue surrounding acoustic ceiling removal is safety.
Asbestos was used in some ceiling mixtures as a fire retardant and
insulator until the mid-1970s, when it was outlawed. Asbestos fibers
that become loose can be inhaled and can cause cancer and other
respiratory diseases, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, before an acoustic ceiling more than 20 years old
can be removed, a piece of it must be tested for asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the possible danger that occurs when scraping away an
acoustic ceiling, the testing process is best handled by a licensed
contractor. "The contractor will scrape a little off of a corner and
send it in for a lab report," Lanzone said. "This generally runs
about $20 to $30, and it reveals whether asbestos was used in the
acoustic spray."</TE>
<TE>   Most contractors charge $1 to $3 per square foot for a
non-asbestos job. The price varies depending on the ceiling height,
whether the house will be occupied while the work is done and what
type of finish the customer wants.</TE>
<TE>   If asbestos is found in the ceiling, the scope of the job--and the
costs involved--change dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to bring in a specially trained crew that's qualified
to work with hazardous materials, and that about triples the cost,"
Lanzone said.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where asbestos is found, homeowners can look to other
solutions besides scraping the ceiling, including coating it with
drywall mud and smoothing it into a more acceptable texture.</TE>
<TE>   "You can also simply paint an acoustic ceiling," Christian said.
"That will make it nice and clean, and you might find you don't hate
it as much."</TE>
<TE>   For those who simply can't live under that cottage-cheese look a
day longer and whose ceiling is free of asbestos, the process begins
with the homeowner removing anything from the walls that can fall to
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "The contractor then covers and moves furniture to the sides of
the rooms and attaches plastic sheeting to the walls and floors to
create a 'room within a room,'" said Mark Spangler of Spangler &amp;
Sons, a Chatsworth contractor specializing in acoustic ceiling
removal. "It's designed to keep debris from spreading through the
house."</TE>
<TE>   The ceiling surface is usually loosened with a fine water spray
and scraped to fall onto the plastic-covered floor. Then the debris
and plastic are removed.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently the ceiling is unfinished underneath the acoustic
texture. "Nail heads need to be covered, and joints and cracks need
to be fixed," Lanzone said. "You never know the true condition of the
ceiling until you remove the acoustic texture. In some cases the
living room might be in great shape but the bedrooms need lots of
work."</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who have started to redo their ceilings themselves
often call in experts at this point. "I get lots of calls from people
who've scraped the acoustic off, but they weren't prepared for what
was underneath," Spangler said. "There's much more to it than just
scraping away the acoustic surface, plus you're doing finish work on
a ceiling, which is hard on your neck."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, contractors will apply a "knockdown" texture to the
ceiling after scraping it. "It's a camouflaged look. You don't notice
the imperfections in the ceiling surface, and it's similar to the
texture of a drywall surface," Lanzone said.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a good contractor for acoustic ceiling removal is the same
as searching for any other type of specialist. "Talk to neighbors and
friends who've had the work done and get their experiences," Lanzone
said. "Take a look at different ceilings you like to see what kind of
finish you're after."</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything else, you get what you pay for," Spangler said. "If
someone comes in with a bid that's much lower than anyone else,
they're probably cutting corners somewhere. If you get someone who
does a lousy job on your ceilings, they're not the ones who have to
live with it."</TE>
<TE>   And while removing an acoustic ceiling may be a dusty, messy job,
the results are worth the effort and the money. "It's a clean look
that seems to make a room look larger," Spangler said. "In all the
years I've removed these ceilings, I've never had someone call and
say they wanted one sprayed on again."</TE>

<LD>Question: What is the best way to seal a garage door?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: We assume you are referring to a sectional garage door
rather than the tilt type.</LD>
<LD>   Generally speaking, a high-quality sectional garage door that has
been properly installed is reasonably weatherproof. But even the best
doors can begin to leak after long use.</LD>
<TE>   A simple fix is to apply a 1-inch-wide strip of rubber to the
inside surface of the door at each horizontal section joint, from one
side of the door to the other.</TE>
<TE>   Apply the strip to the upper section centered between it and the
section below. A special rubber bottom can be purchased to fit the
base of just about any garage door.</TE>
<TE>   For the sides of the opening, on the outside trim attach
old-fashioned weatherstripping for a conventional door. It's the type
with the round vinyl bead attached to a flat metal strip.</TE>
<TE>   If the door is wood, use staples or nails to attach your
windproofing. If the door is a metal one, use half-inch, self-tapping
screws.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have all the materials, you should be able to do the
entire job in an afternoon.</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON--The biggest unanswered question facing American
homeowners at tax time this year might strike you as odd: What is an
"unforeseen circumstance" and how can you claim one to avoid capital
gains taxes on a profitable home sale?</LD>
<LD>   That question has been pending before the Internal Revenue Service
for more than a year with no answer in sight. Yet the issue has
potentially large financial significance for anyone who has resold a
home at a profit after occupying it for less than two years.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what's involved: You probably know that under tax reform
legislation enacted in 1997 and 1998, you can exclude from taxation
up to $250,000 (as a single filer) or up to $500,000 (if married
filing jointly) of profits on the sale of your home, provided you
owned and used it as a principal residence for at least two of the
five years preceding the sale. For the vast majority of American
homeowners, the law renders home sale profits totally tax free.</LD>
<TE>   But many sellers find themselves in situations that disqualify
them for the strict tests of two years' ownership and two years' use.
For them, Congress provided a safety net. Taxpayers who sell before
the required two-year period because of a change in place of
employment, a change in health or because of unforeseen circumstances
can qualify for what Congress called a "reduced exclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who cannot claim employment change, health change or
unforeseen circumstances in connection with their early sale get no
tax exclusion: They pay full capital gains tax on every dollar of
their profits.</TE>
<TE>   The reduced exclusion for those who qualify is a fraction of the
standard $250,000/$500,000 exclusion. For example, a single homeowner
who is transferred by her employer after owning her home for 18
months--six months short of the required 24-month minimum--could
qualify for a reduced exclusion of three-fourths (18 months/24
months) of the maximum $250,000 tax-free exclusion or $187,500.</TE>
<TE>   The same taxpayer could qualify for similar relief if she had to
sell the house after 18 months because of an extended hospitalization
for a health problem. Ditto if she had to sell for a bona fide
unforeseen circumstance forcing a premature sale. What precisely is
an unforeseen circumstance? Congress threw the task of defining
"unforeseen" to the IRS, which it directed to issue "guidance,
including regulations and letter rulings" for taxpayers. Early last
year the IRS held a public hearing seeking advice, but it has not yet
made conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, leaves some taxpayers scratching their
heads--especially in the dozens of real estate markets around the
country that have experienced double-digit home value appreciation
during the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Back to the basic question: What is an unforeseen circumstance? A
highly aggressive definition would include almost anything that a
taxpayer didn't anticipate--unpleasant neighbors, barking dogs next
door, unexpectedly loud street noise. To be extreme, you could argue
that just about everything is unforeseen.</TE>
<TE>   You can be certain that the IRS' view of unforeseen will be
considerably more restrictive than that. At the public hearing last
year, the agency took note of suggestions from tax professionals
representing the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Among their proposals for unforeseen events qualifying sellers for
reduced exclusions were:</TE>
<TE>   * A change in the health of a family member, necessitating an
early sale of the home. You might, for example, have to relocate to
help care for a family member in poor health.</TE>
<TE>   * The death of a spouse, a co-owner or a family member.</TE>
<TE>   * Divorce or legal separation requiring sale of the house.</TE>
<TE>   * Unexpected financial hardship, such as the loss of employment by
a resident of the house who helps pay the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   All these appear to fit the spirit of what Congress meant when it
added the unforeseen circumstances safety net. Should you use one of
them to claim a reduced exclusion? You know the answer here: Talk to
your professional tax advisor. Explain the circumstances affecting
your early sale and why they were indeed unforeseen.</TE>
<TE>   Then hope for sympathy from the IRS.</TE>

<LD>When Keith Lehrer, a businessman, attorney and former drummer of the
Circle Jerks, wanted to remodel his 1950s ranch-style house in
Bel-Air, he contacted Santa Monica architect David Hertz, who created
a contemporary eyeful that showcases green design and construction.</LD>
<LD>   "The architect pretty much took it to the ground," said Realtor
Tracy Moss, who shares the listing with her husband, Franklin.</LD>
<LD>   When work was completed in 1998, the house didn't look anything
like its old self.</LD>
<TE>   About the home: Its new look included a soaring living-room
ceiling, an open floor plan, a third-floor sun deck/meditation area
and an open-cage elevator in a glass tower. The layout of the home
was determined in part by its site with city, valley and mountain
views.</TE>
<TE>   Windows were treated with high UV-protection film, water in the
pool was solar heated and building materials were less toxic and more
resource-efficient than those used in typical construction. The
architect also made sure that the use of paint on interiors was
minimized and that the paint used contained no volatile organic
compounds, which have been implicated in problems of indoor air
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz is founder and president of Syndesis Inc., an architecture,
design and manufacturing firm specializing in "creating sustainable
strategies and environmental products."</TE>
<TE>   The house has been used in filming TV commercials, including one
aired during Super Bowl XXXVI that netted $10,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3,950,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: The house has five bedrooms and six bathrooms in 6,767
square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home overlooks the Stone Canyon Reservoir and has a
dumbwaiter, laundry chute, media room wired for Surround Sound,
refrigerated wine storage room, gym, instant hot-water plumbing, four
wood-burning fireplaces and a master bathroom with a steam room and
spa.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Bel-Air, West Gate</TE>
<TE>   Contact: Franklin and Tracy Moss, Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills,
(310) 456-7975.</TE>
<TE>   To submit a candidate for Home of the Week, please send color
interior and exterior photos (copies only, please; we cannot return
the pictures) and a brief description of the house, including what
makes the property unusual, to Ruth Ryon, Real Estate Section, Los
Angeles Times, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012; or e-mail

<LD>John Cleese, a creator and star of the BBC-TV series "Monty Python's
Flying Circus," has listed a beachfront Montecito home that he owns
at just under $5.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The British comedian plays the owner of a TV network on the ABC
sitcom "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)," which will debut Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not just selling a house. I'm buying a neighbor," Cleese said
by phone from his home next door, which he has owned since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   When the house he's selling came on the market about a year ago,
he purchased it so he could choose who would live there.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to my wife that we were too old to move again," said
Cleese, 62. "We're looking for a film director or maybe a
scriptwriter--someone who doesn't have loud parties. The house has a
big, wide front and no garden behind, so it's not so good for kids."</TE>
<TE>   The house has four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about 6,000
square feet. The living room has wood floors, beam ceilings and walls
of glass. The kitchen opens to an atrium dining bay overlooking the
beach. The master bedroom suite has an office-exercise room. The
ground floor has a wine closet and French doors that lead to the
90-foot wooden deck on the sand.</TE>
<TE>   The three-level house, with an elevator, also has a large "fun
room" at beach level with a sauna, wet bar and fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   "Occasionally we see a dozen surfers," Cleese said, "but the
houses are in a little enclave."</TE>
<TE>   He was drawn to his home after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. He
and his wife, Alyce Faye, were staying on the 13th floor of an L.A.
hotel when the quake hit. "When they allowed us to escape, we drove
up the coast and fell in love with Santa Barbara," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple maintain a home in London but now spend more than six
months of the year in Southern California. "There are a lot of
reasons to be here," he said. "Ninety percent of my work is here."</TE>
<TE>   He has a recurring role on the upcoming series, which co-stars Ed
Begley Jr. and Ivan Sergei. Six episodes have been filmed. "In May,
we'll await our fate," Cleese said.</TE>
<TE>   In July, he'll film his part for the next Harry Potter movie. He
played Nearly Headless Nick in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone."</TE>
<TE>   In January, he filmed his role as R, Q's assistant in the 20th
James Bond movie. He played R in "The World Is Not Enough" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   Cleese, who also appeared in the movie "Rat Race" (2001), acted in
and co-wrote all of the Monty Python feature films and also wrote the
screenplay for and was executive producer of "A Fish Called Wanda"
(1988), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and former Monty
Python member Michael Palin.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Solakian of Coldwell Banker Previews, Montecito, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Evans, a British radio DJ and TV host who became a
multimillionaire media mogul in the U.K., and his pop-star wife,
Billie Piper, have purchased a Sunset Strip-area home for about $7.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Evans, 36, and Piper, 19, were married last May in Las Vegas. They
also have a flat in London and a manor house in Surrey. They bought
in L.A. because he plans to negotiate TV work here, sources said. (He
was reported to have sold his Ginger Media Group two years ago for
roughly $320 million.) The couple purchased a one-story,
6,000-square-foot villa with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and
city-to-ocean views. The master suite has a sitting room and his and
hers bathrooms. Built in 1979, the home also has a guest house,
tennis court and pool.</TE>
<TE>   Piper is known for her so-called brat anthem "Because We Want To,"
which made it big on British radio in 1998 when she was 16. Evans was
a DJ then.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, had the listing,
and Gordon MacGeachy of the same firm represented the buyers, other
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Marvel Smith--the 6-foot-5-inch, 310-pound starting offensive
tackle with the Pittsburgh Steelers--and his wife, Kellie, have
purchased an off-season home in Canyon Country, just north of
Valencia in the Santa Clarita Valley, for about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The football player just finished his second year with the
Steelers, and NFL insiders say that he is a future pro-bowl
selection.</TE>
<TE>   His California home, which was built in 1999, has six bedrooms in
slightly more than 3,000 square feet. The Smiths' primary residence
is in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Cohen, estates director, Re/Max Olson, Westlake Village,
represented the Smiths in their purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Francis, who was recently cast to star in a TV movie based on
the life of controversial former Cincinnati Reds partner Marge
Schott, has purchased a three-bedroom condo in Montecito for
$800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, who won a Golden Globe for her performance in the '60s
series "Honey West" and also appeared in such feature films as "Funny
Girl" (1968) with Barbra Streisand and "Blackboard Jungle" (1955)
with Glenn Ford, also sold her Palm Springs home for $525,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Corman's Chateau Productions recently cast Francis to star in
the movie "Out of Her League," based on the life of Schott, who was
banned from baseball in 1993 for her racially insensitive remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Schott was forced to sell her partnership for $67 million after
baseball commissioner Bud Selig ordered her to give up her
controlling interest. The movie will go into production early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Marriott, senior vice president of strategic planning for USA
Networks Inc., and his wife, Cara, have listed their Spanish
Colonial-style home near Caltech in Pasadena for about $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Marriotts are moving to New York so he can work at the
corporate offices of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought the home two years ago from Scott Weiland, lead
singer of the rock group Stone Temple Pilots, and his former wife,
Jannina.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1929 and designed by architect John Paul Jones, the house
has four bedrooms in about 3,400 square feet. The home also has
hand-hewn beams, arches, Spanish tiles, many built-ins and French
doors.</TE>
<TE>   Patti Sano of Coldwell Banker, Old Pasadena, and Carol Thomson of
Coldwell Banker, San Marino, have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills home of the late Freddy de Cordova, a longtime
producer of the NBC "Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson, and his wife,
Janet, has been sold. The asking price was about $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The producer, who also directed the Ronald Reagan movie "Bedtime
for Bonzo" (1951), died in September at age 90. His widow moved to
Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Built for the producer and his wife in 1965, the 4,400-square-foot
house has two master suites, a bedroom-den, maid's room, library and
pool.</TE>
<TE>   Bernice and Janine Gershon of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
South, had the listing.</TE>

<HD>Tenant's Death a Liability</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Who's Liable for Leased Unit's Rent if Tenant Dies?"
(March 10): Kevin Postema is correct describing liability for a
leased unit.</LD>
<LD>   If the tenant has a month-to-month tenancy, however, "the tenancy
is terminated as of the 30th day following the tenant's last payment
of rent before the tenant's death." (Miller &amp; Desatnik Management Co.
v. Bullock (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13. Civil Code 1934.)</LD>
<LD>   The result is a landlord, when a tenant dies, may get less than
the usual "30-day notice." For example, in the case cited, the tenant
paid rent on Sept. 15 and died on Sept. 21. The Court found the
tenancy ended Oct. 15.</LD>

<HD>Life and Times of Jim Brown</HD>
<DH>Movies: Spike Lee documents the athletic and civic
achievements of a controversial American figure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An infomercial is an infomercial, but it can be a fascinating
infomercial. "Jim Brown: All-American" is that kind of film
production because it is about one of the most compelling athletes of
all time and one of the most debatable.</LD>
<LD>   As an athlete, Brown was much more than the greatest running back
of all time. As an individual, his insights and efforts toward
boosting the black community remain beyond the ambition of all but a
few black athletes. His box-office success as a movie star was far
beyond any athlete, and as such he broke limitations for black
actors. He remains an outspoken and articulate figure who can hold an
audience.</LD>
<LD>   And at present he is in jail, serving six months in California.</LD>
<TE>   "Jim Brown: All-American" is a worshipful production by Spike Lee,
who takes a worshipful stance about athletes. It opens at the Film
Forum in downtown Manhattan on Friday and will play on HBO in
December. It runs 130 minutes, which is long for television, and in a
movie house it needs a special audience.</TE>
<TE>   But it is about Jim Brown, who does have a certain fascination. He
grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., as the greatest athlete ever on Long
Island. What he accomplished in the NFL makes a joke of hysterical
claims about other running backs. As a champion of black improvement
and black economics, he never fails to show affection for Ed Walsh,
his Manhasset football coach, Ken Molloy, the attorney who raised
money to send Brown to Syracuse when the school refused a
scholarship, and other white figures who influenced his life. He
makes so much sense in his political and economic projects.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the performance chart of his life is full of
paternity suits, assault charges, violence and the landmark charge
that he threw a lover off a balcony. The promotion for the film says
Lee "neither ignores nor minimizes the underside," but comes to grips
with the balcony charge. Brown says Eva Marie Bohn-Chinn actually was
coming to his defense when the police arrived, and she jumped. On
camera she says, "He was coming at me," and the next thing she knew
she was waking up in the courtyard, and, "Why would I jump?"</TE>
<TE>   There is no minimizing Brown's athletic greatness especially when
"great" is often routine. He was perhaps the greatest lacrosse player
ever. He was a world-class decathlete. He was an outstanding college
basketball player. As a football player, he was most valuable player
and rookie of the year in 1958, and he was MVP for the second time in
his last season before retiring in 1965 at 29. He led the league in
rushing eight of his nine seasons. For his career he averaged a
stupendous 5.22 yards a carry. He missed half of one game. He won one
NFL championship.</TE>
<TE>   In Brown's nine seasons, the New York Giants won five division
championships. His battles with the Giants and linebacker Sam Huff
were monumental.</TE>
<TE>   Lee highlights the drubbing of the Colts in the '64 championship
game. He never mentions the Giants, who beat the Cleveland Browns
three times in '58 to get to the famous overtime championship. In the
playoff game, Huff and the Giants held Brown to eight yards in seven
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Brown left football because he was in the movies, making "The
Dirty Dozen" and couldn't get back to start the season. Lee
identifies him as "the black John Wayne." Well, neither Brown nor his
films were nominated for Oscars, but mostly they were interesting
viewing. He was a breakthrough in that he was the first black actor
permitted to be an action star and a sexual figure--even with white
women.</TE>
<TE>   Lee always shows Brown wearing his green African cap called a
kufi, and always with biceps bulging from a sleeveless shirt. A film
historian says Brown created the era of blaxploitation.</TE>
<TE>   All the while he was creating the Negro Industrial and Economic
Union "to urge blacks to get involved in economics," particularly
athletes who never gave a dime of thought to anything like that. To
Brown that's far more relevant than whether there are two or 30 black
head coaches. In the '80s he created Amer-I-can to inspire inner-city
youth and the program has spread to 23 states.</TE>
<TE>   And then we go back to the long line of personal issues, beginning
when he was living at the home of his high school girlfriend in
Roslyn and going out with other girls. When Lee's film mentions the
mother of Brown's children, it often doesn't specify which mother.
The first paternity suit was filed for a 2-year-old in 1960, two
years after Brown's first marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The film ends with the birth of Brown's most recent son. At
present Brown is serving time for attacking with a shovel the car his
present wife, Monique, was driving. He refused to go to counseling
and to spend 40 days on a work crew cleaning the streets.</TE>
<TE>   He is not a one-way man.</TE>

<HD>Forward's Father Can't Escape a Troubled Past</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Former All-American doesn't watch his son play
or keep in touch with former teammates as paranoid schizophrenia
keeps him secluded from family and friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAUN POWELL</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>He didn't see the Kansas Jayhawks try to make a move toward the Final
Four, where he took them a quarter-century ago. Nor did he see his
son, a starting forward for Illinois, face the steepest challenge of
a young man's basketball life.</LD>
<LD>   No, Norm Cook didn't see Kansas play Illinois or anything from
this Sweet 16 matchup that no proud alum and father would dare miss.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he sat alone in his modest house, stared at the walls
instead of a TV screen, and watched demons, ghosts and an imaginary
person who's been chasing him for years.</LD>
<TE>   The father of Brian Cook suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The
illness helped ruin a promising NBA career, a marriage and a
relationship with a son who inherited all the basketball genes. The
mental disorder might be glamorized Sunday by a few Oscars, but make
no mistake here: There's nothing wonderful about this particular
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a recluse," said Duncan Reid, the former high school and
college coach of Norm Cook. "He's lost."</TE>
<TE>   Norm Cook never has seen his son play. Ever. No youth games, no
high school games, hasn't been to an Illini game yet. Imagine the
cruelty in that: A former Kansas All-American and first-round pick of
the Boston Celtics denied the pleasure of watching his son blossom
into a fine forward. Brian hasn't seen much of his father, either.
Ever since his mother fled after the divorce 16 years ago, six years
after Brian was born, she and the kids have kept their distance.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't talked to him in a long time," Brian said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   How long? Pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Long."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, nobody speaks to Norm Cook much these days. Reid
recalled him as a sweet-mannered teenager in Lincoln, Ill. The coach
brought the strong 6-foot-9 center along after taking a job in Kansas
as an assistant. Last year, Reid held a reunion for his former
Illinois state championship teams. Everyone showed but one. Several
of them had an idea: If Norm can't come to us, why not go to him?
They knocked on the door. No answer. They knocked again. A pair of
eyes shot through a crack in the blinds.</TE>
<TE>   "Norman," said the coach. "It's me, Coach Reid." The door opened
slightly, then slammed shut.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not Coach Reid," Cook screamed. "Ain't no basketballs in
this house."</TE>
<TE>   Reid walked away, shaking his head. He hasn't heard from or seen
his former star player since. "A sad situation," Reid recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Reid said the first signs of Cook's mental condition came shortly
after Cook left Kansas for the NBA as a junior, a novelty back in
1976. The Celtics took him 16th overall but released him after one
season. It was then, during a brief stay with the Denver Nuggets,
that Cook confided in his teammates: "Someone's following me."</TE>
<TE>   His basketball career ended shortly thereafter. Then he met Joyce,
who gave birth to Brian in 1980. The family deteriorated, and Joyce,
who accused Norm of hitting her more than once, cited the mental
illness. During the last several years, Norm, who turned 47 Thursday,
has been arrested numerous times, mostly for misdemeanors but also
once in '94 for aggravated battery. Stripped of his family, Norm
lives alone, according to his old coach, and spends his time walking
around town and staring at strangers. Sometimes, he's either taken
back home or to a state hospital in nearby Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   If only he could see what's become of his son, now a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Brian stands an inch taller than his father and is nimble as well.
What he didn't inherit was the toughness. That's what the Illinois
coaches and players always try to bring out in Brian, whose
basketball career beyond college depends on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still working on the physical part," he said, laughing. "But
people do tell me I have a better shot than my dad. He could bang
down low, but at least I can face the basket."</TE>
<TE>   He's also playing more consistently. His 13.5-point average is
second on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation with my dad taught me basketball isn't going to be
around forever," Brian said. "He didn't stay and get his degree. I've
got to leave here with something besides a playing career."</TE>

<HD>NASCAR's Changes Becoming Common</HD>

<LD>Now appearing at a Winston Cup track near you--the 2003 Fodgiac.
Fodgiac?</LD>
<LD>   That's the nickname in the garage for the re-designed Pontiac,
which in essence is simply a third generation Ford Taurus. Same
templates, similar design--only the decals have been changed to
protect what product identity these cars have left.</LD>
<LD>   When NASCAR approved the new model for the Grand Prix last year,
it gave the Pontiac teams the templates from the Dodge Intrepid as a
baseline for the design of the new car. NASCAR defines templates as
"devices used to check the body shape and size to ensure compliance
with the rules." They also are supposed to "closely resemble the
shape of the factory version of the cars." But lately, any
resemblance to the showroom models is purely incidental.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, when DaimlerChrysler decided to return Dodge to Winston
Cup racing for the first time since 1985, the Ford Taurus was
considered the strongest car aerodynamically. There were just 15
months to develop the Dodge for the 2001 Daytona 500, so NASCAR
borrowed the Taurus templates to expedite the building process.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Ford offers NASCAR the 2004 Taurus for approval this
autumn, that car should prove to be the most aerodynamically
efficient machine at the track, especially because it will have been
tested and tweaked for more than five years with de facto help from
Pontiac and Dodge.</TE>
<TE>   In its search for parity among the manufacturers, NASCAR is moving
toward the day when the cars are so close in design that the only
things that may distinguish one make from another are the
manufacturers' emblems and headlight decals.</TE>
<TE>   Just line up the four makes of cars without identification--Ford,
Dodge, Pontiac and Chevrolet--and see whether you can tell the
difference. According to Winston Cup Director John Darby, if all the
cars were painted white, sans sponsor decals and numbers, telling
them apart would be virtually impossible. "Today we're not as far
away from (common templates) as the outside might appear," Darby
says.</TE>
<TE>   However, common templates would benefit the teams because of the
money they would save on testing. NASCAR limits teams to seven tests
a year (13 for rookies) on tracks on the Cup schedule, but nothing
stops them from taking their cars to other speedways, proving grounds
or wind tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Teams test in an attempt to find out what adjustments on the cars
work best at what type of tracks. With common templates, teams
wouldn't have to test as often because all the cars would react the
same aerodynamically.</TE>

<HD>Sample Vancouver's World-Class Attractions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have always been a fan of the easy, unpretentious charm of Canada.
One of its loveliest and most livable towns, in my book, is
Vancouver, the West Coast jewel that is British Columbia's largest
city and a popular jumping-off point for Alaska cruises.</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver's climate is temperate much of the year (think Seattle),
and the city is an exciting mix of Victorian and futuristic,
outdoorsy and cultured (the latter in an increasingly
international--especially Asian--manner). And did I mention the
prices? They're moderate to begin with, and when you add the fact
that $1 U.S. will yield nearly $1.60 Canadian, it makes for an
outstanding city break this spring or summer.</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver boasts an abundance of the attractions you would expect
from a world-class city. Among its compelling museums are an
anthropology museum with a superb collection of Pacific Northwest
Native American art, a dramatic and interesting maritime museum, the
popular and fun aquarium and the Pacific Space Centre.</LD>
<TE>   But this is a city whose quintessence really lies in its outdoors,
whether one is enjoying the green expanse of Stanley Park; exploring
one of North America's most vibrant Chinatowns; enjoying a drink on
the waterfront; shopping the trendy West End; wandering the Granville
Island Public Market (a bustling shopping, dining and entertainment
complex); treading the cobblestones of Gastown, Vancouver's oldest
section; or hiking the scenic North Shore.</TE>
<TE>   There's also an edgier, counterculturish side to this once-staid
city, from the former hippie enclave of Kitsilano to cafes like Blunt
Brothers on West Hastings Street. A lively gay and lesbian scene is
centered in the West End and Commercial Drive.</TE>
<TE>   For budget lodgings, sharing top honors is downtown's 104-year-old
Victorian Hotel, 514 Homer St.; (877) 681-6369, fax (604) 681-8776,
www.victorian-hotel.com, nicely restored to its period elegance. Nine
of the 27 rooms have private baths and go for $50 to $69 double
(these and other prices are in U.S. dollars); shared-bath rooms are
just $37.</TE>
<TE>   Some might prefer the atmosphere of the landmark 115-room Sylvia
Hotel, 1154 Gilford St.; (604) 681-9321, fax (604) 682-3551,
www.sylviahotel.com, an ivy-covered 1912 grande dame in the West End,
where doubles go for $47 to $91. The view of English Bay Beach out
front is breathtaking, and the restaurants and nightspots of trendy
Denman Street are around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Other decent picks: the coed YWCA Hotel/Residence, 733 Beatty St.;
(800) 663-1424, fax (604) 681-2550, www.ywcahotel.com, doubles $70
with private bath, $54 with shared bath, or the Buchan Hotel, 1906
Haro St.; (800) 668-6654, fax (604) 685-5367, www.buchanhotel.com,
doubles $47 to $60 with private bath, $28 to $47 without; check the
Web site for even lower-priced specials.</TE>
<TE>   In a multicultural city like this, ethnicity is thick, and much of
it is wallet-friendly. When in Chinatown, don't miss Hon's Wun Tun
House at 108-268 Keefer St., (604) 688-0871. There's another location
at 1339 Robson St., (604) 685-0871. At either spot, a half-dozen of
the renowned potstickers will set you back $1.90. A few blocks west
of Chinatown, in the West End, go Greek at Stepho's, 1124 Davie St.,
(604) 683-2555, where you can gorge on roast lamb with five side
dishes for $5.65. Or check out the inexpensive pasta dishes at
Rossini's, with two locations: 162 Water St. in Gastown, (604)
408-1300, and 1525 Yew St. in Kits Beach, north of the city, (604)
737-8080.</TE>
<TE>   There are often special promotions and discounts, some of which
are listed on the city tourist board's Web site,
www.tourismvancouver.com (which allows online hotel bookings); the
tourist board can also be reached at (604) 683-2000. In a program
that started recently, paying with a Visa card can get you a slew of
"Vancouver Rewards"--special discounts and deals in a variety of
lodgings, restaurants, shops and more. Find details at
www.vancouverrewards.com.</TE>
<TE>   The surrounding province of British Columbia--with sites like the
famed year-round Whistler resort--is a paradise for lovers of sports
and the outdoors. Get information about many of its offerings,
including special packages, at (800) 435-5622 or www.hellobc.com.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Beginning to Restore Several Flights to Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reflecting confidence that Americans are returning to European
travel, US Airways is restoring most of the transatlantic service
that it cut after the Sept. 11 attacks. In the next three months it
will add 37 round-trip flights. Only Charlotte, N.C.-Paris and
Philadelphia-Brussels, routes cut last fall, are still off the
schedule, said spokesman David Castelveter.</LD>
<LD>   Castelveter declined to provide numbers to support the decision to
restore flights, but he did say, "Clearly we wouldn't be adding
service if the demand didn't exist." The airline earlier reported
that its revenue passenger miles were down 7.9% in January and 4.4%
in February on international routes overall compared with last year.</LD>
<LD>   Other carriers have announced modest service increases, although
not all had released their transatlantic schedules for summer by last
week. British Airways will add one daily flight each to its
Boston-London, Washington-London and New York-London routes, starting
March 31. The moves will restore service between the U.S. and
Heathrow airport to pre-Sept. 11 levels. In April, BA will add
another weekly flight between New York and London on its supersonic
Concorde jet. In February the airline carried 3.6% fewer passengers
in the Americas than last year.</LD>
<TE>   Air France plans to restore its second daily flights between Paris
and Los Angeles (May 20), Boston (March 31) and Washington (April
16), which were suspended last winter; increase flights to Newark,
N.J., and New York; and restore daily Concorde service on June 1.
Overall, however, it still plans to provide about 14% fewer seats
this summer than last to North America; Dallas service is being
eliminated, and some 747s are being replaced with smaller planes on
some routes.</TE>

<HD>Spring Blooms Go Bust in California Deserts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where have all the flowers gone?</LD>
<LD>   Fans who trek to California's desert parks each spring to gawk at
the floral annuals are wilted spirits this year. A drought has vexed
the purple sand verbena and drubbed the desert gold.</LD>
<LD>   "There's really nothing in bloom here at all," said Dale Housley,
a ranger at Death Valley National Park. Typically the annuals peak
about now in the valley and may bloom into June at higher elevations.
But they require rain, which washes off the seed coating, in order to
germinate, Housley said.</LD>
<TE>   Anza-Borrego Desert State Park has received about 1.6 inches this
season, but it usually has several inches by now. It got about a
quarter-inch last Sunday, but it was "too little, too late to bring
about the bloom of annuals" except in some isolated, remote canyons,
a spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Dig This: New Museum for Anglo-Saxon Artifacts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Treasures from one of England's most important archeological sites
are displayed at a $7-million museum that opened this month at Sutton
Hoo, near Woodbridge in Suffolk County. The items were recovered from
a 1,400-year-old Anglo-Saxon burial mound at Sutton Hoo that has been
under excavation since 1939.</LD>
<LD>   A full-size reconstruction of the burial chamber, which was formed
from a ship that was buried underground, is a highlight of the new
museum. London's British Museum, which houses excavated items, has
lent some of them to the new museum. Objects include a sword and
shield believed to have belonged to warrior-king Raedwald; a
warrior's helmet; gold ornaments; and Byzantine silver.</LD>
<LD>   The museum is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday through
May 31, daily in summer. Fee: about $5. 011-44-1394-389-700,

<LD>The State Department updated its long-standing "Worldwide Caution"
after last week's fatal grenade assault on a Protestant church in
Islamabad, Pakistan. It urged Americans abroad to avoid "facilities
where Americans are generally known to congregate or visit," such as
clubs, restaurants, places of worship or outdoor sports events. or
"increase their security awareness." For more warnings or updates,
call (202) 647-5225, www.travel.state.gov.</LD>

<HD>Different Strokes in the Nevada Desert</HD>
<DH>A stunning course in Mesquite draws the attention-- and
breath--of an avid golfer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MESQUITE, Nev.</DL>
<LD>I stood on a patch of turf 11 stories above the desert floor. The
crisp, thin air was silent. My heart raced as I peeked below.</LD>
<LD>   The panorama of colors brightened by the morning sun was
breathtaking: giant puffs of cottony clouds. Red-rock canyon walls.
Lush green fairways. Sparkling blue ponds.</LD>
<LD>   Wow. This is what it must feel like to stand on top of the world.
Soaking in the landscape, I almost forgot why I was at the second
tee.</LD>
<TE>   I have played some of the most scenic and challenging golf courses
in the country--Cypress Point overlooking Spanish Bay on the Monterey
Peninsula, Pinehurst No. 2 nestled in the North Carolina sand hills,
Ocean Trails on the bluffs of Rancho Palos Verdes and Isleworth
Country Club in Windermere, Fla., home to Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Put Wolf Creek at Paradise Canyon near the top of that list. To
get a sense of the sheer natural beauty, imagine laying down 18 holes
inside the Grand Canyon. "It's as dramatic and spectacular as they
come, and if there's any golf on a grander scale, we haven't seen
it," raved Links magazine.</TE>
<TE>   I had never heard of Wolf Creek before planning a weekend in
Mesquite, an hour's drive northeast of Las Vegas. A small town that
didn't install its first stoplight until 1998, Mesquite is fast
becoming a popular golf destination. Within minutes of one another
are five courses, including the Oasis, designed by Arnold Palmer. A
sixth course is to open later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Brochures promote Mesquite's camping, fishing, hayrides, skeet and
trap shooting, access to nearby Zion and Bryce Canyon national parks
and "the nightlife of the casino adventure," all at low prices. Last
month my wife, Willow, and I took advantage of Presidents Day and
spent a three-day weekend checking the place out.</TE>
<TE>   The standard Mesquite stay-and-play package offers three rounds of
golf and three nights' lodging starting at $330. I signed up for a
two-night, two-round package with surcharges for playing Wolf Creek
at peak season. With a third night of accommodations, we paid $421,
including taxes. Considering that Wolf Creek greens fees run $150,
the package seemed like a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Willow recently began taking golf lessons but chose spa treatments
and extra sleep while I played Saturday and Sunday mornings. We
filled out the weekend with an afternoon drive to scenic St. George,
Utah, and time at the blackjack tables--but more on that later.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived late Friday night after clogged freeways tacked on two
hours to an expected five-hour drive from Los Angeles. The two hotels
available with our package, the CasaBlanca and the Oasis, are across
the street from each other. We wanted to stay at the CasaBlanca, the
newer and nicer property, but it was booked.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oasis, the voucher for my Saturday morning round of golf
had mysteriously vanished, and the computer showed my Sunday morning
round scheduled for 3:17 p.m. The desk clerk assured me that the
hotel manager would fix everything by morning.</TE>
<TE>   Our third-floor room was cramped and spartan. No coffee maker. No
hair dryer. Not even a box of tissue. The view outside our window
consisted of murky ponds surrounded by litter.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning, after the hotel manager failed to produce a golf
voucher, I headed out to the Palms Golf Club for a 9:20 tee time. The
pro shop had no record of my golf package and demanded the $95 greens
fee.</TE>
<TE>   My "stay and play" package had suddenly been converted to "pay,
then play." I pulled out the credit card and headed for the first
tee, ready to swing my Callaway driver at anything and anyone.</TE>
<TE>   On the fourth tee, a pro shop attendant drove up to explain that
golf packages were not available on a holiday weekend, the clerk who
had issued my reservation had been fired and management had wanted to
stick me with the bill. But he had appealed on my behalf and gotten
my $95 refunded.</TE>
<TE>   Two holes later, a woman in a beer cart informed me that the head
golf pro had approved free beverages for me and my assigned playing
partner, Mark Dillard. It wasn't yet 11 a.m., but Dillard, a
strapping Nevada fire captain, and I weren't about to pass up this
opportunity. Besides, my game and my nerves needed a drink.</TE>
<TE>   We ordered a couple of beers, kicked back and enjoyed the round.
By the time Dillard ran into the beer lady on the 17th hole, we had
consumed three complimentary beers apiece. When he ordered a fourth
round, she said the golf pro had rescinded the offer. "It's not like
we were drinking double scotches," he cracked.</TE>
<TE>   The Palms is the oldest course in Mesquite, and it shows. The
front nine is flat and boring, while the back nine has elevated tee
boxes and is a bit more challenging. Patches of dead grass dotted the
fairways, and brown spots marred the greens.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the hotel's spa, Willow had a better time with a massage
and a facial. She gave the hotel high marks for a soothing couple of
hours. The staff was friendly, the robes were fluffy and the masseuse
hit all the pressure points.</TE>
<TE>   We spent Saturday afternoon taking a 30-mile scenic drive
northeast on Interstate 15 to St. George. Willow and I marveled at
the sunlight reflecting off canyon walls, then were drawn to the
gleaming white dome of St. George Temple. Inside the visitor center,
elder Leo Elkins spent a good half-hour recounting the fascinating
history behind the building, which was ordered built by Brigham Young
in 1871 and is the oldest Mormon temple in the world.</TE>
<TE>   We headed back to Mesquite and checked out four casinos, all the
same: smoky rooms filled with gamblers of all stripes. To my
astonishment, I spotted a $1 blackjack table.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't win much, but we had better luck picking restaurants
throughout the weekend. Even the Oasis' "Slot Player's Special"--two
eggs cooked to order, bacon, toast and hash browns for $1.49--made
for a tasty breakfast one day.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner on Saturday was at Los Lupes, a Mexican dive tucked in a
strip mall. The cilantro-laced salsa was delicious, and the carne
asada came with a slab of sirloin big enough to feed a family of
four.</TE>
<TE>   As surprising as the restaurants were, the weekend's highlight was
still Wolf Creek on Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The full page of fine print on a liability release hinted at what
was in store. "WARNING: Use golf teeing areas appropriate to your
health condition. If you have heart, respiratory or other
debilitating health problems, do not attempt to use the elevated
teeing areas."</TE>
<TE>   Caution is appropriate. Elevation changes are so sharp, speed
bumps are built into downhill cart paths to keep drivers from going
too fast and veering off course.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf Creek ([702] 346-1670, www.playthewolf.com) provides a
supreme test of skill. The longest tee boxes measure 6,994 yards and
carry a 154 slope rating, among the most difficult awarded by the
U.S. Golf Assn. Fortunately the layout features four other sets of
tee boxes. The shortest is 4,169 yards, making it accessible to
duffers of all skills.</TE>
<TE>   On the first tee, the view of the 504-yard par 5 through sandstone
cliffs was stunning.</TE>
<TE>   To get to the second tee box, I climbed 118 steps. It takes about
a 230-yard tee shot to carry the canyon and reach the fairway. I
envisioned the sweet sensation of launching a Titleist into orbit and
watching it glide for several seconds before landing safely on the
short grass. Instead, I hooked the ball around a rocky cliff, and it
quickly disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Most resort courses have a signature hole that stands out as the
most scenic. At Wolf Creek, a dozen holes could compete for that
title. After the round, Willow and I enjoyed a buffet brunch and
Bloody Marys at the Baileyi grill inside Wolf Creek's clubhouse.
Later we returned with a request to ride up to the second tee for
sunset.</TE>
<TE>   I had raved so much about the No. 2 hole that Willow's
expectations were high. The view did not disappoint. We sat on the
grass holding hands and watching the sunset.</TE>
<TE>   That night we ate at the Redd Room, a steakhouse hailed by the
Oasis concierge as the finest dining in Mesquite. The dress code was
casual, the decor a mix of red velvet, mirrored ceilings and purple
lights. Appearance aside, the restaurant served excellent food:
lobster bisque, Caesar salad prepared tableside and filet mignon,
cooked to perfection. The bill for four courses was less than we
expected: $81.56 plus tip.</TE>
<TE>   Walking back to our hotel through a parking lot jammed with motor
homes, tractor-trailers and dusty cars from neighboring states,
Willow and I decided that Mesquite isn't for everyone. But for anyone
looking for a spectacular golf course and good food at reasonable
prices, it proved to be above par.</TE>

<HD>Intrigued by the Etruscans</HD>
<DH>In museums and excavated sites, searching for traces of an
ancient civilization.</DH>

<AU>DALE M. BROWN</AU>

<DL>PANZANO, Italy</DL>
<LD>Before there was Rome, there was Etruria, the land of the ancient
Etruscans. In their heyday, their realm not only included Tuscany but
also stretched north to present-day Bologna and south to the region
where the Eternal City would rise. Minerals, rich soil, thick forests
and easy access to Mediterranean trade routes enabled them to become
powerful people with a distinct language and culture. In the 7th
century BC, they even ruled Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Fascinated by these first Italians, my wife, Liet, and I made them
the focus of a journey in June, the greater part of it spent
wandering in a rented car through the hilly region named after its
early inhabitants. For us, part of Tuscany's allure is the mystery
attached to the Etruscans: While inscriptions on their stone tombs
can still be read, their fragile linen manuscripts moldered away long
ago. Little is known of their history or literature and almost
nothing of their origins. Some scholars theorize that they came from
Asia Minor, or that perhaps the culture had local origins, but there
is no definitive proof.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily the Etruscans left relics behind in tombs and graves from
the 9th century before Christ to 90 BC, when Rome declared them
citizens of the empire. Among the objects that endured are gold
jewelry and bronze armor and weapons, as well as household items such
as votive figures, incense burners, mirrors, distinctive black
pottery called bucchero and priceless Greek vases.</TE>
<TE>   Our initial exposure to the Etruscan past came on the drive north
from Rome's airport. Tired from our flight, we spent our first two
nights in the Umbrian town of Orvieto, just south of Tuscany. We had
stayed at the Hotel Maitani before and liked the flower-lined terrace
with an enchanting view of the gleaming white marble-and-gilt facade
of the city's cathedral. On the same street is one of our favorite
restaurants, Trattoria Etrusca, where we had a bracing
lentil-and-spelt soup, followed by salad and a plate of polenta, wild
mushrooms and truffles, all complemented by a bottle of local white
wine.</TE>
<TE>   We awoke the next day ready to explore beautiful Orvieto, a
flourishing Etruscan center two millenniums ago. While the city's
position high on a bluff provided a commanding view, it made
obtaining drinking water difficult back then. As we would see, the
ancient inhabitants went to great lengths to ensure a supply.</TE>
<TE>   Orvieto stands over a honeycomb of about 1,200 man-made caves,
many dating to the Etruscan era. In one dark and cool hollow, we
looked at a well that had been dug through hundreds of feet of soft
volcanic stone called tufa and through clay underneath to reach
water. Just how this feat was accomplished no one can say precisely,
but according to our cheerful guide, large bellows probably were used
to pump air into the well during construction so workers wouldn't
suffocate.</TE>
<TE>   More vivid evidence of Orvieto's founders lay outside town on a
slope beneath cliffs, a spot called Crocifisso del Tufo, an excavated
necropolis that dates from the 6th to 5th century BC. The burial
ground was like none we had seen before: narrow paths lined with
stone tombs that looked like flat-roofed houses, the names of the
dead carved over the doorways. All are about the same size,
suggesting an egalitarian society. Round stone seats are outside many
of them, good places for the spirits to sit and visit.</TE>
<TE>   We examined more historical treasures--a collection of box-shaped
marble and terra-cotta cinerary urns--in Orvieto's recently
refurbished Faina archeology museum, opposite the cathedral.
Miniature effigies of the deceased recline on the lids of the urns,
the ashes inside since removed. It was as though the figures were
participating in a banquet--men and women eating lying down, propped
up on one elbow, just as the Greeks and Romans did. Many of the
figures hold bowl-shaped drinking vessels, and some of the men in
their loose, toga-like apparel have plump, slack bellies, a proud
emblem of the good life.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also contains a large collection of painted Greek
vases, extraordinary pottery that the Etruscans imported, used in
life and carried with them into death. Some of the best examples of
this Greek art on display in museums worldwide came from Etruscan
graves.</TE>
<TE>   Refreshed by our Orvieto stay, we drove north a couple of hours to
a house we rented outside the tiny town of Panzano, halfway between
Florence and Siena and the base for our daily adventures.</TE>
<TE>   For an overview of Etruscan culture, we traveled first to
Florence's archeology museum. We were fascinated by the collection's
greatest treasure, the 4th century BC bronze Chimera, a crouching
lion with a snake's tail and a goat's head sprouting from its back.</TE>
<TE>   I was equally taken with a reconstruction of a circular 2nd
century BC stone tomb from Arezzo under an earthen mound in the
museum garden. Loosely clad figures lounge atop more than a dozen
rectangular urns arranged side by side on a stone bench around the
wall. They stare eerily into space, as though taking a break from a
banquet to reflect on life.</TE>
<TE>   If the Etruscans seemed still to haunt this space, it was in the
countryside--and especially in the Tuscan hill towns--where they
became most real to us.</TE>
<TE>   San Gimignano was a sleepy backwater when I first visited in the
early '60s, but thanks to its skyline of medieval towers, it has
grown into a gorgeous tourist trap.</TE>
<TE>   Here we found the Etruscan Mystery Museum, which honors the town's
Etruscan past by departing from the curatorial norm. The focus is on
items used in daily life, such as artifacts in reconstructed scenes
of an Etruscan kitchen and banquet hall (where I learned that most
Etruscans ate but one meal a day). Other sections, such as "Cult of
the Dead," have objects related to healing and funerary rituals.</TE>
<TE>   Etruscan women, we were surprised to read, could keep their
surnames after marriage, participate in banquets as equals of the men
and drink freely of the wine--all acts that were forbidden to proper
Greek and Roman women. (In Greek and Roman society, only courtesans
could attend feasts.) A favorite banquet food was roasted wild boar,
still a Tuscan staple thanks to the endurance of extensive forests
where the tusked beasts roam. For a taste of the ancient treat, we
bought boar salami and a jar of boar pate at a meat shop. Both were
zesty--not gamy but rich.</TE>
<TE>   From San Gimignano we drove to Volterra, less than 20 miles to the
west. The countryside can only be described as muscular, with giant
rock outcrops flexed against the sky. Volterra possesses a stony
strength that evokes the industrious, hard-living Etruscans who once
lived here. A large arched gate dating to about the 3rd century BC
still forms part of the city wall; it looks like a natural formation,
the stone blocks worn and creviced by time and weather.</TE>
<TE>   Volterra boasts one of Italy's best Etruscan museums, the
Guarnacci. Near the entrance, the contents of a recently unearthed
nobleman's grave, complete with bronze breastplate, helmet and
weapons, speak eloquently of the courage these people displayed on
the battlefield, especially in their wars with the Romans.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Guarnacci's treasures is an urn ("Gli Sposi," which
translates to "The Married Couple"), two millenniums old, with an
aged couple depicted on its lid, their expressions resigned yet sad.
Some scholars dispute the notion that they are man and wife and
suggest that the woman is a demon escorting the man to the next
world.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's real piece de resistance is a haunting figure,
poetically called "Shadow of the Evening," a thin, elongated bronze
statue of a naked boy with his arms and hands pressed tightly to his
sides. Though it dates from the 3rd century BC, it is so modern in
appearance it easily could be mistaken for the work of the 20th
century sculptor Alberto Giacometti. It was found by a farmer plowing
his field; he took it home and used it as a poker before it was
rescued and recognized for its artistic greatness. Scholars think it
may have been placed in the ground in hopes of making the soil more
fertile.</TE>
<TE>   We soon realized that Etruscan museums and relics exist almost
everywhere in Tuscany. Siena, Arezzo, Montepulciano and Cortona are
just a few key towns.</TE>
<TE>   Montepulciano has a house that features rectangular stone urns
embedded in its lower story like building blocks. Cortona is the
proud possessor of a round bronze lamp more than 2,400 years old.
It's suspended from the ceiling of a pergola that the local Etruscan
museum created especially for the piece. The 16 cups for oil around
the edge were cast in the shape of mythological figures' heads;
underneath, forming the bottom of the lamp, is the face of a monster.</TE>
<TE>   We could not visit all the collections, and with time growing
short, we sought out some of the tombs, many of which are decorated
with wall paintings depicting scenes of daily life.</TE>
<TE>   The first we entered lies just outside Chiusi, a city with deep
roots in the Etruscan past. Three tombs here are open to the public.
(Arrangements to visit them with a guide must be made beforehand at
Chiusi's archeological museum.)</TE>
<TE>   The Monkey's Tomb recently underwent a long, painstaking
restoration. We climbed down a flight of stairs into the clammy
semidarkness, our eyes adjusting to the dim image of a monkey hanging
from a tree. Obscured for years, the painting is visible again thanks
to meticulous cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Even though we found the work a bit anticlimactic, the tomb itself
interested us as a prime example of state-of-the-art preservation. A
lighting system featuring "cold lights" has been installed, and the
humidity and temperature levels are controlled by computers connected
to a lab in Florence, about 75 miles away. Except for the lights,
none of the modern equipment is visible. A guide led us into dank
chambers with couches for the dead carved from the stone lining the
walls. Over everything hung a sense of eternity--and the pungent
scent of moist earth.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, in another tomb, we were startled to come upon a crime
scene. The lid of a sarcophagus had been propped open by grave
robbers. The instrument they used as a wedge was the lid of a
cinerary urn, the head on top functioning as the prop. Archeologists
left the makeshift tool in place. Looking closely at the face, I
thought the features bore a striking resemblance to our guide, a
reminder that while Etruscan culture may have been subverted by Rome,
the Etruscans themselves never died out. They are, to a great extent,
the Tuscans of today.</TE>
<TE>   With our trip ending, we headed back to Rome. Before the flight
home, we stopped at the city's renowned Etruscan National Museum at
Villa Giulia. It's hard to think of such a magnificent collection
being anything but astounding. I must say, however, that on our way
south we had come across something even more striking: brightly
painted tombs that we had seen previously only in art books.</TE>
<TE>   Our first glimpse of these small chambers was in the National
Museum of Tarquinia (which, by the way, displays enough erotic
pottery from Tuscan graves to demonstrate just how life-loving the
Etruscans were). The tomb paintings were transferred to canvas and
removed from their original locations by conservationists who feared
the effects of tourists and high humidity levels. Reconstructed
within the museum behind glass, the wall paintings offer vivid
glimpses of the Etruscans engaged in activities associated with
funeral banquets, including dancing. I was surprised that some of the
images--familiar to me from art books--were not life size, as I had
imagined. A striding, caped youth in sandals blowing on double
pipes--perhaps the most reproduced of all Etruscan
paintings--measures only a few feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   With advancements in preservation techniques, other Tarquinian
tomb paintings discovered more recently have been left where they
came to light, a couple of miles outside town. We reached them by
long staircases carved out of the limestone and running deep into the
earth.</TE>
<TE>   Each tomb lies behind a locked metal door with a glass window.
Conditions are tightly controlled. By pressing a button, we could
light up the interiors briefly and see all the warm ochers, reds,
greens, tans and oranges of the ancient paintings leaping out at us.
For a few instants, there before our eyes were the Etruscans
feasting, wrestling, fishing, swimming, hunting and boxing, before
the lights went out and these lovers of life disappeared once more
into darkness.</TE>

<HD>Two Vaccines Prove Not Immune to the Vagaries of Fate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN DOHENY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vaccines are supposed to be a traveler's ally, guarding against
diseases that lurk in exotic locales or even at home.</LD>
<LD>   But two recent developments prove vaccines aren't foolproof. In
December, several lots of Vaqta, a vaccine to prevent the viral liver
infection hepatitis A, were voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer,
which feared the vaccine didn't protect patients adequately. And late
last month, the manufacturer removed from the market the only vaccine
available in the U.S. that protects against Lyme disease.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, with a little know-how, travelers can still protect
themselves against both diseases.</LD>
<TE>   In all, 40 lots of Vaqta, all single-dose syringes, were recalled
because their levels of antigen--a substance that stimulates the
production of antibodies--were insufficient, said Art Kaufman, a
spokesman for Merck &amp; Co., which makes the vaccine. Consumers who may
have received doses from the recalled lots would have been vaccinated
with the adult dose after May 29, 2001, and with the pediatric or
teen dose after June 16, 1999. (Vaqta is administered in one primary
dose and one booster.) Merck has contacted physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Those who may have been vaccinated with an affected lot should
consult their doctor. If you were given a vaccine from a recalled lot
and your doctor decides to do a blood test to see whether you are
adequately protected against hepatitis A, Merck will cover the cost
of the test, Kaufman said. If the doctor thinks you need another
vaccination, Merck will also cover the cost of the vaccine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Merck is halting production of the vaccine in syringes until the
manufacturing process is improved, Kaufman said, and will still
supply Vaqta in vials, which have had no production problems.</TE>
<TE>   Hepatitis A is spread by contaminated food and drink and is a
problem in developing countries, where sanitation can be poor.
Outbreaks also occur in the U.S. In 1997 more than 200
schoolchildren, most of them in Michigan, contracted the disease
after eating tainted strawberries, according to the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms can include fever, loss of appetite and abdominal
discomfort, followed by jaundice. The disease can last from a few
weeks to several months. To prevent it, travelers, especially if they
are not vaccinated, are urged to avoid food that might be
contaminated--raw vegetables, fruits and fruit juices, milk products
and shellfish are often implicated in outbreaks--and avoid drinking
water and beverages containing ice in areas of poor sanitation. There
is no specific treatment, just supportive care such as a nutritious
diet and plenty of rest.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Vaqta recall, GlaxoSmithKline in late February
pulled its Lyme disease vaccine, Lymerix, off the market, citing poor
demand. On the market since 1999, Lymerix was the only vaccine for
Lyme disease available here.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors had observed the condition for years but didn't identify
it as Lyme disease until a cluster of cases occurred in 1977 in Lyme,
Conn. The illness, which is spread to humans through the bite of deer
ticks infected with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is now found
in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic and the north-central part of the
country, as well as in some northwestern California counties,
according to the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer's withdrawal of Lymerix came as no surprise--and
often as a relief--to Lyme disease organizations. "We've been working
to get it off the market," said Chris Malinowski, a spokesman for the
Lyme Disease Foundation. The manufacturer has been the target of
several lawsuits from consumers who say the vaccine left them with
neurologic or joint disease or inflammation of heart muscle tissue.
Malinowski says his group has also received reports from vaccinated
patients complaining of "brain fog" and sensitivity to light and
sound.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman Ramona DuBose would not say how many
lawsuits have been filed, and emphasized that the vaccine was
withdrawn only because of low demand.</TE>
<TE>   After evaluating the 905 adverse reports received after a total of
1.4 million doses were given, CDC researchers concluded in a report
published last month that most of the adverse reactions did not
differ from what was reported in clinical trials, which were not
judged significant enough to prevent marketing approval.</TE>
<TE>   One exception was the 22 hypersensitivity reactions reported.
These ranged from hives to difficulty breathing, which are typical
symptoms of an allergic reaction, said Dr. Ned Hayes, medical
epidemiologist with the CDC Lyme disease branch. But it could not be
proved that these reactions were caused by the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms of Lyme disease include a bull's-eye rash, fever,
headache and fatigue. Antibiotics are used to treat the illness; if
untreated, it can become severe or disabling, according to the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers can still guard against Lyme disease. The CDC suggests
wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts (in light colors so ticks show
up more easily) and using insect repellents containing DEET (N,
N-diethyl-meta-toluamide).</TE>

<LD>"Always hike with caution as rattlesnakes are common on the Carrizo
Plain and can be seen on any warm, sunny day," one brochure says.</LD>
<LD>   Don't say you weren't warned. The Bureau of Land Management goes
out of its way to ensure that travelers know about snakes, sudden
changes in weather and other considerations when visiting this
remote, newly named national monument in eastern San Luis Obispo
County.</LD>
<LD>   It has no drinking water. No gas stations. No food.</LD>
<TE>   And you might as well leave the cell phone at home. It doesn't
work out here.</TE>
<TE>   Remember that dirt roads become muddy and impassable after rain.
And watch for animals, the BLM warns, "to prevent road kills as well
as possible damage to you and your vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   This austere, nearly treeless grassland--sometimes called
California's Serengeti--is not for everyone. But naturalists were
thrilled when President Clinton designated the Carrizo Plain as a
national monument in January 2001. The monument is managed by the BLM
in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and
the Nature Conservancy, which has long been involved in the land's
preservation.</TE>
<TE>   The plain is 45 miles long and 10 miles wide, bounded by the
Temblor Range to the east and the Caliente Range to the west.
Attractions include birds, pronghorn antelope, tule elk, wildflowers
and the San Andreas fault. One attraction you can't see: silence,
which seems remarkable these days.</TE>
<TE>   Begin at Guy L. Goodwin Education Center, open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Thursday through Sunday from December through May, and possibly part
of June. (These are the best months to visit; forget coming here in
summer, when temperatures exceed 100.)</TE>
<TE>   Ask the staff about self-guided auto tours and docent-led
interpretive walks to Painted Rock, a sacred Native American
ceremonial site nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibits explain San Joaquin Valley ecology, earthquake-country
geology and the Native American and ranching history of the area. A
stunning mural of the plain and its diverse wildlife by Santa Barbara
artist John Iwerks dominates one wall. Children enjoy playing with an
enormous Carrizo Plain puzzle, also created by Iwerks, that sits
below his painting.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the area is Soda Lake. Mapmakers
matter-of-factly call it a dry lake, but more appreciative
naturalists call it an alkali wetland--one of the largest and least
disturbed in California. When rain fills the lake, it attracts
migratory birds. The sandhill crane is the marquee migrant among the
wintering waterfowl.</TE>
<TE>   The lake remained dry this winter. But even without the birds,
Soda Lake has a weird appeal. Heat waves rise off the surface's
shimmering salts, giving the lake bed an ethereal glow.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the lake shore, follow a half-mile (round trip) trail
that extends from a turnout off Soda Lake Road, opposite Carrizo
Plain Overlook. Once you reach the lake bed, boardwalks run along the
shore. Interpretive signs explain how wildlife has adapted to this
harsh environment.</TE>
<TE>   Serious hikers trek along Caliente Ridge, 14 miles round trip with
a 1,100-foot elevation gain. The route is long but not too difficult
because the steep, rough road (high-clearance vehicle required) to
the trail head accounts for most of the ascent of Caliente Mountain,
at about 5,100 feet the highest in San Luis Obispo County. During
World War II, military lookouts watched for enemy aircraft from the
top; on particularly clear days one can see the snowcapped peaks of
the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you're not in the mood for 14 miles, a shorter hike along
the Caliente Ridge reveals grand views. For a fine family walk, check
out the boulder cluster just off Selby Road on the way to Selby Camp
and the Caliente Mountain trail head.</TE>
<TE>   Another option is the Wallace Creek Interpretive Trail. The San
Andreas fault cuts through the Temblor Range, and geologists say one
of its most distinct sections can be seen at the northern edge of
Carrizo Plain. Wallace Creek Interpretive Trail offers a short walk
and a geology guide to the fault. An interpretive pamphlet is
available at the Goodwin Education Center.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the center, follow U.S. 101 to Santa Margarita, about 10
miles north of San Luis Obispo. Exit onto California 58 and drive
about 50 miles east to Soda Lake Road; turn right (south). Drive
eight miles to the northern boundary of Carrizo Plain National
Monument, then seven miles farther to the center.</TE>
<TE>   The park also is accessible from Interstate 5. At Buttonwillow,
take California 58 about 40 miles west to Soda Lake Road, and follow
the directions above.</TE>
<TE>   Consider entering the monument from the north and exiting at the
south end, where California 166 will lead east to I-5 in the Central
Valley or go west toward U.S. 101 near Santa Maria.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Long Flight? Don't Come Hungry</HD>
<DH>Many airlines are bringing back meals that were cut after
Sept. 11, but the intervals between them may seem mighty long.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The report of the death of the on-board meal has been greatly
exaggerated, to loosely paraphrase Mark Twain.</LD>
<LD>   True, many U.S. airlines reduced or eliminated food service after
the Sept. 11 attacks. But of the nine majors, Alaska and Continental
never did cut back, and several have restored some service sliced
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   It is still possible to tuck into beef tenderloin in puff pastry
with brandy sauce at 35,000 feet, as Alaska Airlines' first-class
passengers may do.</LD>
<TE>   But although some food service is coming back, it remains below
pre-Sept. 11 levels for many U.S. airlines. That means fewer meals
and longer intervals between them, especially for people in the cheap
seats. On American and Delta, for instance, coach passengers may go
four hours in the air without food, under guidelines announced last
fall and still in effect. Those four hours can easily stretch to
seven or more if you're taking connecting flights.</TE>
<TE>   Just writing about that kind of denial makes my stomach growl. But
for those with conditions such as diabetes, delay can be deadly.
People who take medications to lower their blood sugar should eat
every three to four hours, says Mary Mead, a registered dietitian and
lecturer at UC Berkeley. In fact, it's a good idea for everyone to
eat that often to avoid swings in blood sugar, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Where to get the food?</TE>
<TE>   Mead suggests taking your own. "Unfortunately, there's a lot of
really unhealthy food at airports," she says. A study last year of 10
major U.S. airports by the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine criticized the restaurants for offering too many
"mystery-meat chili dogs and greasy hamburgers"; fewer than 60% had
healthy, vegetarian meals. (I can empathize. While waiting last fall
for a flight from LAX, I scoured the airport for non-refried beans to
satisfy my protein craving, without success.)</TE>
<TE>   Even if you know your flight will offer food, "you never know what
will happen," so take food anyway, Mead advises. Many of us can
testify to the wisdom of that. I once found myself in the Dallas-Fort
Worth airport past midnight with all restaurants shuttered, after bad
weather and a security scare delayed my return trip from New Orleans
by hours. The bag of nuts I had bought en route came in handy.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out which flights offer food these days can be tricky.
The most reliable way is to call airline reservations and ask about
your flight, "but I don't think a lot of customers know to ask," says
American spokesman Todd Burke. Some airlines' Internet sites also
give this information, as should the itinerary a travel agent gives
you.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines have astonishingly varied food-service policies, and they
are riddled with exceptions. Most require that meal-serving flights
depart or fly through "meal windows," typically two hours, such as 5
to 7 p.m. for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   An update on some guidelines for domestic travel:</TE>
<TE>   Alaska's rule is "meals at mealtime," says spokesman Jack Walsh,
except on short flights, such as those between Southern California
and the Bay Area. Whether the meal will be hot or cold depends on
flight length.</TE>
<TE>   American provides food to passengers on flights of at least four
hours in coach and two hours in first class. Regardless of duration,
flights that go all the way to either coast from its Dallas-Fort
Worth hub have food service. Before Sept. 11, the cutoff was two
hours for coach and 90 minutes for first class.</TE>
<TE>   America West provides meals on flights to both coasts from its
Phoenix hub; only first-class passengers get meals on flights to the
Midwest and South. Basically, this means a flight must be about 3 1/2
hours to four hours for coach food service. Before Sept. 11, the
cutoff was 2 1/2 to three hours. Whether hot or cold depends on
flight length.</TE>
<TE>   Continental serves food on flights that depart 7 to 9 a.m., 11
a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5 to 7 p.m. and meet other criteria. For coach,
the flight must be at least 11/2 hours for breakfast and two hours
for lunch or dinner. For first class, the cutoff is 11/2 hours for
all meals, and food may be served outside regular meal hours if it's
a route popular with business travelers or the competition serves
meals, spokesman Rahsaan Johnson says.</TE>
<TE>   Delta offers food in coach for flights of more than 1,750 miles
(about four hours) and in first class for flights of more than 700
miles (about two hours). Before Sept. 11, the cutoff for coach was
547 miles for breakfast, 726 miles for lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest serves food in coach on flights from its Midwest hubs
(Detroit, Minneapolis, Memphis, Tenn.) to the West Coast but not to
the East Coast. Before Sept. 11 it served some meals on East Coast
flights and on shorter flights. It will convert first-class service
from cold to hot meals for breakfast on April 7 and for dinner on May
1.</TE>
<TE>   Low-fare Southwest serves snacks ranging from peanuts, raisins or
pretzels for flights of less than 1 1/2 hours to an "enhanced fast
food snack pack" of bread sticks, cheese, cereal bar, cookie and
"meat stick" on longer flights.</TE>
<TE>   United doesn't provide food service in coach on flights of less
than 1,700 miles, with some exceptions, such as between Denver and
the East Coast. It has restored first- and business-class food
service between its Chicago hub and many East Coast cities after
eliminating it on flights of less than 750 miles last fall. Before
Sept. 11, travelers could expect meals or snacks on almost all
flights.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways has restored meal service on most flights except some
short- to mid-range ones, such as those within the Northeast or
between the Northeast and Midwest. Last fall it suspended meal
service on all U.S. flights except transcontinental ones, plus
longer-haul flights to the Caribbean. On March 1, snack service on
flights of more than 1,000 miles was restored in coach. First class
now gets hot meals on flights of more than 700 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as any frequent flier knows, what's considered a
"snack" on one airline may be a "meal" on another. Just what is a
diminutive turkey sandwich with chips? So ask the reservations agent,
especially if you have special dietary needs. Major airlines still
commonly offer a dozen or more types of special meals with advance
notice, typically 24 hours: kosher, gluten free, Muslim, nondairy
vegetarian and more.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's JetBlue. This low-fare entrant makes nonstop
coast-to-coast hauls, serving cookies, bagel chips and blue potato
chips. That's the total food service.</TE>
<TE>   "No, we've never had a complaint, ever" about the food, says
spokeswoman Carla Frio.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she says, "Every time I fly, I pack my own little
lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Just like the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>In Kashgar, Clinging to an Exotic Past</HD>
<DH>The old and new ways mingle in a desert city that straddles
two very different worlds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE MEYER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>KASHGAR, China</DL>
<LD>The train rumbled rhythmically across the northern rim of the
Taklimakan Desert, just ahead of the breaking dawn. I awoke at first
light and stepped from my bunk onto a floor littered with melon rinds
and raisins. Everyone else was asleep. I filled a flask with hot
water from the coal-fired samovar and sipped sesame tea while staring
out the window at the already searing, silent expanse of scrubby
sand, and I imagined covering it on foot as Silk Road travelers had
for centuries.</LD>
<LD>   Across eras and cultures, their accounts of reaching isolated
Kashgar, or Kashi, resonate with relief at completing the trek.
Getting here was none of the fun; walking through Kashgar's gates
safely was all of it. As such, this may be one of the most
anticipated cities in the world.</LD>
<LD>   As the train slowed, I stood at an exit, pressing against the
glass, eager to end this 24-hour ride from the provincial capital and
explore the medieval alleys of what Beijing colleagues had called
"the least Chinese of Chinese cities."</LD>
<TE>   As I rode into town on the bus, we passed a billboard showing a
collage of native Uighur (WEE-gher) people, a central Asiatic race,
that urged, "Strengthen the bonding of nationalities, safeguard the
motherland's unity."</TE>
<TE>   I disembarked at the heart of town, where the only one awake to
greet me was Mao Tse-tung--or at least his solitary statue, looming
above the treeless granite expanse of People's Square and waving
west, over poplar trees, toward the Pamir Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby was the most incongruous sight of all: a Ferris wheel. I
asked a local cabdriver how to say "Ferris wheel" in Uighur, a
language that is similar to Arabic. "We don't," he said, laughing.
"We call it the 'Chinese wheel.'"</TE>
<TE>   Depending which way your body and imagination face, Kashgar is
positioned at the beginning of China or at its end. The city is
nestled in the far west of the nation's Xinjiang ("New Frontier")
province, an area the size of Alaska that borders Tibet to the south,
Mongolia and Kazakhstan to the north and Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the west.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Xinjiang is dubbed the "Uighur Autonomous Region," in
deference to the Turkic Muslim nationality that makes up the majority
of the population here. In recent years the Communist Party's "Open
and Develop the West" campaign has encouraged Han Chinese--the
country's ethnic majority--to immigrate here, illustrating the
region's strategic and economic importance. The result is an
encroaching modernization that is altering Xinjiang's landscape far
beyond mere Ferris wheels. A decade ago Uighurs made up 90% of
Kashgar's population; today they are about half.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving to China in 1995 as a Peace Corps volunteer, I had
seen the country's regions change rapidly, often symbolized by the
ubiquitous automobile, Big Mac and faces of U.S. celebrities as
pitchmen. From a traveler's point of view, these may be unflattering
or unnerving reminders of home. Yet they own a larger place in
snapshots of "real China" than the pictures of wizened old men in Mao
suits, acrobats spinning plates or the Great Wall. China wants to be
as boring as any other prosperous country. Its slogan for the 2008
Summer Games: "New Beijing, Great Olympics." Since the capital won
the bid, it has shaken from bulldozers tearing down the old and
photogenic. "Development," as a billboard there proclaims, "is an
immutable truth."</TE>
<TE>   So I came to Kashgar last summer prepared for a modicum of
Westernization, even in a city closer to Moscow than to Beijing, but
I also was prepared for the opposite. It took Marco Polo three years
to arrive at Kashgar's caravansary, and he spent only 250 words on
his stay, calling the Uighurs "a wretched set of people who eat and
drink in a miserable fashion."</TE>
<TE>   I anticipated any of these combinations of new and old, Han
Chinese and Uighur. But I didn't expect one of my first sights there
to be a Ferris wheel. Nor did I expect a cockfight to be among the
last.</TE>
<TE>   Kashgar's teahouse is in the Uighur, or "old," section of the
city, at the apex of a network of tangled, narrow pedestrian streets
lined with restaurants serving mutton-and-pickle rice, noodles and
fresh bagel-like breads. The food, and the people eating it, looked
anything but wretched or miserable. The scents of saffron and lamb
led me inside the teahouse and up the stairs to a balcony overlooking
the central bazaar. Veiled female merchants and craftsmen clogged the
oasis world below, selling nuts, vegetables, melons, grapes, handmade
clothing, shoes, knives, stringed instruments and doppas, the
embroidered four-cornered hats that Uighur men balance on their
heads. Hand-painted signs for dentists, showing colorful
cross-sections of the human jaw, competed for my eyes' attention,
while my ears strayed to the tinny tinks of copper being pounded into
teapots, candlesticks and tools.</TE>
<TE>   I sat on the veranda, cross-legged in stocking feet on a
threadbare red rug. I ordered tea and a plate of noodles in Chinese.
The man looked at me expectantly. I tried again.</TE>
<TE>   From behind me, in fluent Chinese, a man said, "You should try
using Uighur language in Kashgar."</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, he wasn't ethnically Chinese. Mahmud moved closer
to me. At 75, he had a wispy white beard, a mouthful of gold teeth, a
flowing robe and a bald head covered by a doppa. A former journalist,
Mahmud began a career a decade ago that had netted him more wealth
than a lifetime of writing articles. He sold insurance to Uighurs for
the People's Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Uighur life expectancies keep getting higher, so the policies
mature!" he said, as though this were a secret only he knew.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmud had lived his entire life in Kashgar. As with everyone I
met in China, I asked his age, then considered his profession and
language ability and filled in the blanks with the history-making
events he had lived through: the birth of the new China, the
unsuccessful uprising of the Xinjiang warlord Osman against Beijing
rule, famine, Cultural Revolution, recent ethnic tension and clashes,
and Muslim life under a government that is officially atheist.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahmud didn't want to talk about any of it, at least not then.
Business was good, and life, he said, motioning off the balcony to
the market below, was better than he had ever seen it. Health care
was standard, food was clean, the streets were safe and the economy
was developing. He didn't understand what young people complained
about nowadays. Then he stood to leave. He had life insurance to
sell, and people were buying.</TE>
<TE>   The red tea arrived in an ornate small copper pot on a silver
tray. Next to it was a painted porcelain bowl holding powdered sugar
and a single tiny ceramic cup. Overflowing their own bowl was a mass
of thick, hand-pulled noodles seasoned and fried with green beans,
tomatoes, onions, peppers and mutton. I had eaten laghman (lamian in
Chinese) every day since my arrival in Xinjiang and would continue
until I left. It was nutritious, hot, filling, delicious and cheap.
My bill with the tea came to about 62 cents.</TE>
<TE>   I first saw the teahouse when I cut through the old city in search
of my hotel. The area had been bisected by the concrete girth of
People's Avenue, which fronted the yellow, graceful Id Kah mosque,
one of China's largest and architecturally more akin to a house of
worship than a shopping mall, which most of the country's renovated
mosques resemble. I turned past a billboard of a young Uighur girl
putting a piece of paper into a trash can: "Pay attention to
sanitation; beautify the environment; be a civilized citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Following the twisting, nameless covered alleys past open piles of
garbage and two-story dwellings made of wood, straw and mud, I
quickly lost my place on the city map. I passed one small mosque,
then another and another. Cheerful children emerged from a doorway
and waved, a scene that was repeated as I passed each mosque. After a
half-hour of meandering I realized I had been walking in circles;
they were the same kids, at the same doorway, next to the same
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   I flagged a cab at an intersection and asked the driver to take me
to the Qinibagh Hotel. He laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure that's where you want to go?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," I said, confident that I wanted to head to the former
British consulate that's now a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He flipped on his meter, drove 10 yards across the street and
stopped at a pair of tall white gates. "Here you are," he said.
"That'll be 10 yuan"--about $1.20.</TE>
<TE>   So much for using a map in Kashgar.</TE>
<TE>   You won't find beer in the old town, part of the Muslim influence.
In the new town, the Chinese part of the city, it's everywhere, along
with Internet cafes charging 4 yuan (48 cents) an hour and
telecommunications offices full of Han migrants keeping in touch with
family back east. The new part of Kashgar does its best to imitate
the main streets of any Chinese city. If I closed my eyes and
listened to the beeping taxis, cell phones ringing to the tune of
"The East Is Red," and the cheerful chatter of grandmothers sitting
on storefront steps, I could imagine I was in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   But the heat and unforgiving sun suggested otherwise. The new
section of the city is treeless or lined with seedlings that show the
area's youth. The only shade on the main roads comes from the
ever-present billboards, which exhort civilization and compliance, as
in, "Study from Zhang Jiagang, be a civilized and polite Kashgarite,"
and "Total citizen participation, sweat the real sweat, work hard to
create a clean and civilized city." These sorts of messages appear
throughout China, but never had I seen such a concentration of them
as I did in Kashgar.</TE>
<TE>   I went to a film about an altruistic doctor and bought a soda,
choosing the local brand, Feichang (Extraordinary), instead of Coke
(which sold far better). On one side of the bottle, in Chinese, was
the slogan "Chinese people's own cola." On the other side, in
English, it read, "Future will be better." I laughed at how the
translations didn't match. Then it dawned on me that they weren't
meant to; they formed a complete message.</TE>
<TE>   The Qinibagh Hotel retains nothing that would suggest the British
set up shop in 1908. (The Seman Hotel, on the site of the former
Russian consulate, fares little better.) Both are essentially
standard Chinese hotels whose best feature is an absence of character
that urges you to stay outside and explore. Officially, Kashgar
follows China's one time zone, set to Beijing, akin to Los Angeles
aligning its clocks with New York. In summertime this far west, the
sun rises around 7 a.m. and sets at 11 p.m.; practicality calls for
an unofficial yet widely observed time zone set two hours behind
Beijing. Bus stations quote schedules in Beijing time, movie theaters
in Kashgar time, hotels in Beijing time, restaurants in Kashgar time.
On some days they do the opposite, just to keep things interesting.
So you must ask whether it is local or Beijing time. The one true
clock in the city is Id Kah mosque, where the call to prayer
reverberates from the minarets, a sound seldom heard in greater
China.</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, the mosque welcomes tourists. It was built in 1442
and has since been razed and rebuilt several times; its grounds
remain open throughout the day. When it's closed, a hand-painted sign
in Chinese and English says, "Please don't visit the mosque. It's
praying time now."</TE>
<TE>   The structure holds 4,000 worshipers, and its ornate, colorful
ceilings and beams offset the dusty pomegranate trees in the central
courtyard. I spent an hour inside, learning from two patient little
girls how to pronounce words in my Uighur phrasebook.</TE>
<TE>   Id Kah is one of Kashgar's few "sights." On the outskirts of town
are a couple of fraying tombs, one for the "fragrant" concubine,
Xiangfei, who led a Uighur uprising against the Qing dynasty but was
forced to marry its emperor when the rebellion failed. (The
explanation on site said she "lived madly by his side" before being
forced to commit suicide.) The tomb, like much of Kashgar, tells two
sides of the same story. On the one hand, Xiangfei is a
representation of Uighur nationalism. On the other, she is a reminder
of China's feudal, concubine-taking past, ended by the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   In Kashgar, the main attraction is becoming part of Kashgar. Every
morning I began at the teahouse, and every night I ended with my
shadow blending with that of the minarets, sitting in the square
fronting Id Kah, watching scribes write letters for illiterates, the
parade of weddings and funerals, and artisans shaping metal, sewing
hats and rolling out brightly colored bolts of silk for crowds of
interested women. The time in between flowed languidly away. Or not
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes repeated themselves, the temperature stayed above 100,
noodles were served for every meal, and people called me by name,
just as would happen in a small town. This was life at an oasis, an
isolated patch of nourishment, and I stopped thinking about the world
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Until I met Wei, whom I came across in one of Kashgar's markets.
He was a student at an engineering institute and worked part time as
a guide. He had brought a group of Danish women wearing loose-fitting
embroidered pants to the International Trade Market of Central and
Western Asia, a sprawling Sunday affair that brought in merchants
from bordering counties and countries, and tens of thousands of
shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Uighur Ikea. In one area you could buy sheep and donkeys;
in another carts and harnesses; and in another carved wood furniture,
housewares and electronics. The largest section of the acres-wide
market was given over to hand-sewn shoes, clothing and luxuriant
carpets. Traders arrived on horseback, on foot, on bicycle and in
their own cars. It was a cross-section of Kashgar society.</TE>
<TE>   Wei said the Danish women wanted more "minority pants." He
couldn't figure out why foreigners always bought those ridiculous
pants, but he told them to meet him in two hours. That's how long we
would be gone to the cockfight, he said. That seemed like a long time
to me. "You haven't seen a Kashgar cockfight," Wei said.</TE>
<TE>   On Fridays and Saturdays the new Sporta City arena was the Toy Box
"Shake Your Soul!" Disco, and on Sunday it was a cockfight ring. The
bar sold Cointreau, coconut milk, Sprite and Remy Martin XO. From the
ceiling hung inflated lips that said "Kiss" in English and an
assortment of T. rexes, life rafts and bottles of Miller Genuine
Draft. A spray-painted mural showed a blond woman in a bikini
entering the surf. We paid about $1.20 each and entered.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly Uighurs hunched over the
railing, staring at a green carpet littered with feathers and chicken
droppings. The men wore long robes and four-cornered doppas, and all
smoked. The men with money smoked Kwangchow filtered cigarettes,
which came in a box and cost 3 yuan (about 35 cents). Others puffed
on tobacco rolled in the People's Daily.</TE>
<TE>   A small round table with two chairs sat in the middle of the dance
floor-cum-fight ring. On the tabletop was a microphone. Wei and I sat
in the first tier of seats as large, scabby roosters strutted around
us. Sometimes one would crow, and another would answer. The
spectators leaned forward and stared at the green carpet.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that I realized there really was a cockfight going on.
In a nation where gambling is prohibited and anything smacking of
peasant tradition and backwardness is banned, I blinked in disbelief.
Wei said that since the Communist liberation in 1949, the cocks
weren't allowed to kill one another. That's what the umpire was
for--to call the fight when blood was drawn and declare one cock the
winner. Progress of a sort. I wondered if low-contact cockfighting
was as bad as the standard battle. Would the roosters wear protective
headgear?</TE>
<TE>   Across the arena, a man raised a rooster high in the air. Wei
poked me, and we got up along with everybody else to crowd around the
man and stare at his rooster. The animal was a specimen--downy black
feathers, sharp cream beak and sturdy yellow legs. He didn't have a
scratch on him. I nicknamed him Tyson. His challenger was an animal I
called the Big Pif Paf, after the popular roach repellent sold in
Kashgar's bazaar. Blood was caked on his feet, an eye was scabbed
shut and hunks of feathers were missing.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody got out 10-yuan notes and seemed to give them to the
person next to him. I handed mine to Wei and said I wanted the Big
Pif Paf.</TE>
<TE>   Two handlers came into the ring and washed their hands in a bucket
of water. Then they scooped up each bird and rubbed water on it.</TE>
<TE>   The umpire snapped awake, lighted a cigarette and stood up. It had
been one hour since we entered the center, an hour of sitting in
stifling heat that smelled like chickens. I had the feeling that we
had left China, that we had passed its billboards for civilization
and spiritual construction and continued down an ancient road.</TE>
<TE>   The announcer spat out a sentence, and the two handlers brought
the roosters to the center of the arena. The crowd split in two, one
cock's backers on the left, the other on the right. Tyson and the Big
Pif Paf faced off. The fight began. I told Wei I had to go.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the bustle of the Kashgar International Trade Market of
Central and Western Asia, I bought a Feichang cola and some salted
almonds. The soda bottle promised it was Chinese people's own cola
and that the future would be better. The cellophane bag holding the
almonds read, "Enjoy the sunshine. Enjoy your life." I sat in the
warm, timeless Xinjiang sun, savoring the nuts, watching the crowd,
and did exactly as it said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guidebook: Calling in Kashgar</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Connecting service to Urumqi from LAX is available
on China Southern. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $2,354. From
LAX, you also can fly to Beijing nonstop on China Eastern Airlines
and Air China International and connecting service (change of planes)
on United, Air Canada, China Southern, Northwest, Korean, Asiana and
Thai. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $670 in April, increasing
for late spring and summer. You can then take a 24-hour train ride on
the new railway that traces the northern rim of the Taklimakan
Desert. The air-conditioned train departs in the afternoon and
arrives the next day. A ticket for a hard-sleeper berth (padded bunks
stacked facing one another in groups of six) costs $50.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code), 86 (country code for China) and the
local number.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: The Qinibagh, also called Qiniwake, Hotel, 144
Seman Road, 998-284-2299, fax 998-282-3842, is on the grounds of the
old British mission. A double room with bath and a fan (though
without air-conditioning) is about $15; a dorm bed costs $5. The
concrete structure is drab, but its ambience is enlivened by busloads
of Pakistani traders and Chinese tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The more popular option for backpackers is the Seman Hotel, 337
Seman Road, 998-255-2129, fax 998-25-52861. (John's Cafe, information
central and an Internet cafe, has its local branch here.) The hotel
is a 10-minute walk from the heart of town and borders the new
Chinese city. Dorms are from $4, including the ones upstairs in the
grandiose former conservatory, and doubles are from $10.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: I ate at the Chakhana Teahouse, near the Id Kah
mosque (no phone), for less than a dollar. Kashgar's central bazaar
is home to numerous noodle (laghman) and saffron rice stalls; you'll
see the giant woks smoking atop brick kilns. Mutton is the meat of
choice here, often marinated in a sesame batter and eaten from long
metal skewers. Dumplings, doughier and greasier than the Chinese
variety, are stuffed with lamb and onions and fried.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I read with great interest Jane Engle's article ("Darn All Those
Nickel and Dime Hotel Fees," Travel Insider, March 17).</LD>
<LD>   I urge all hotel visitors to vigorously dispute surcharges and
fees that were not disclosed when the hotel reservation was made. I
have found on dozens of occasions that politely but firmly disputing
these surcharges at checkout time results in their reversal.</LD>
<LD>   If the hotel clerk does not agree to remove the surcharges, speak
to a supervisor or manager. If the supervisor or manager does not
rectify the situation, politely ask for the name and title of every
employee involved. Then write to the general manager of the hotel and
send a copy to the corporate office of the hotel chain or parent
company. In your letter, say that you want restitution for the
hotel's unethical business practices. In most cases you will receive
a refund of the surcharges or fees paid, plus additional restitution
or compensation.</LD>
<TE>   No one should allow hotels (or any other business, for that
matter) to get away with charging undisclosed surcharges and fees.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Travel Agents Cry Foul Over Internet Fare Deals," Travel
Insider, Feb. 17: As a travel agent, I charge a transaction fee on
airline tickets, but I still do not make money on them. They are
purely a customer service and a cost of doing business. If there were
a quick and easy alternative for my clients to book proper flight
schedules at a fair price, I would stop selling airline tickets
altogether.</LD>
<LD>   I know my clients as neither the Internet nor the impersonal voice
on the phone from the airlines reservations desk can know them. I
know if they are eligible for a senior discount, whether they can
handle a flight connection or need to fly on nonstops, whether they
will need a wheelchair or any other service. When the proper flight
schedule is arranged, things go more smoothly for the passenger and
the airline.</LD>

<LD>   I have a 21-year-old daughter and now a grandson. My daughter

<HD>Napa for Next to Nada</HD>
<DH>In the Napa Valley, known for costly haute culture, the
financially challenged can uncover good value--and even bargains--in
lodging, sightseeing, wining and dining.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES T. YENCKEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CALISTOGA</DL>
<LD>A friend of ours, a high-powered lobbyist in Washington, D.C.,
complained the other day that the room he booked in Napa Valley would
set him back $700 a night.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't there some place cheaper you could recommend?" he asked,
knowing that my wife, Sandy, and I are frequent visitors to Northern
California's wine country. We've been there three times in four
years.</LD>
<LD>   "Is 75 bucks a night cheap enough?" I asked, reaffirming my
credentials as a tightwad traveler.</LD>
<TE>   He laughed. "Let's not go overboard," he said. "You can check into
a roadside dump. We're looking for something a little more romantic,
no more than, say, $350 a night."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Napa has several lovely places to stay at that price, and I
gave him a couple of names. Let him spend the big bucks, I thought.
I'll just keep my romantic little $75-a-night secret for myself.</TE>
<TE>   A rare and beautiful place that has blossomed into something of a
theme park for wine buffs and food lovers, Napa Valley deserves its
reputation as an expensive destination. But here and there bargains
can be found--in lodging, dining, wine sipping and sightseeing--which
make the valley affordable even for the financially challenged. My
wife and I spent four days in February seeking them out. Winter and
early spring are low season but a great time to go. The crowds are
gone, and if the sun cooperates you can picnic with a view.</TE>
<TE>   Our lobbyist friend, I'm sure, was kidding when he suggested we
might be foisting a dump on him. The lodgings we found--mostly
motels--appeared well kept and inviting and had pleasant settings
within easy reach of the vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   The best lodging buys are clustered in Calistoga, a small
hot-springs resort town at Napa Valley's northern end. Tucked at the
foot of a lofty ridge, it's a pretty town that retains the look of
the frontier West and has about 5,000 residents and more than a dozen
spas. Lincoln Avenue, its well-preserved main street, is dotted with
galleries; its cafes cater to a range of budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Our finest find was the one the lobbyist turned down: the
Calistoga Inn Restaurant &amp; Brewery, a 90-year-old charmer filled with
antiques, where we spent much of our time on this trip. Downstairs is
a good, moderately priced restaurant and bar. Upstairs are 18 clean,
sunny rooms that go for $75 a night for two from Sunday through
Thursday. On weekends and holidays the price increases to $100, still
a bargain in the valley. A continental breakfast is also provided.</TE>
<TE>   The drawback: The rooms share toilets and showers, although each
has a sink. "European style" is how the Calistoga describes this
arrangement, and it is as nice as any European shared-bath pension
where I have stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the valley we found similarly appealing rooms, all
with private baths, for about $80 to $150, or a little more during
peak summer and fall seasons. (Midweek rates are cheapest.)</TE>
<TE>   We found dining at reasonable rates easy too. At St. Helena's
Trattoria Tomatina, two can dine under the stars on triple-cheese
ravioli in a lemon butter sauce and a mixed green salad for about
$50, even if you each order a glass of wine.</TE>
<TE>   Calistoga's popular Smokehouse Cafe served up a full barbecue
chicken dinner (with roasted Yukon potatoes, portabello mushrooms,
salad and cornbread) for $13.95. Even cheaper was Taylor's Automatic
Refresher in St. Helena, a classic drive-in with contemporary pizazz.
Its whopping Texas burger (Jack cheese, salsa, guacamole, mayo and
pickled jalapenos), a full meal, cost only $6.49. A glass of Napa
wine added $5 to the bill. We ate and sipped at picnic tables and
watched the passers-by.</TE>
<TE>   Like dining and wine tasting, a mud bath is a quintessential Napa
Valley experience, and the rates at spas in Calistoga tend to be more
reasonable than elsewhere in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Our favorite spa is funky Dr. Wilkinson's Hot Springs Resort,
which we've visited three times. On this trip we signed up for "the
Works," a two-hour budget-priced round of pampering for $99 per
person.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy went to the women's spa section, and I to the men's. I
stepped into a deep, tiled tub of hot volcanic mud. This time I knew
what to expect. But on our first visit I watched apprehensively as a
spa attendant stirred the steaming mud with a huge wood paddle. Then
he beckoned me from a stool where I was waiting nearly naked.</TE>
<TE>   "Just step right in," he said, as I dropped the towel from around
my waist and hesitantly placed one foot and then the next into the
muck. "Now sit down and stretch out, and I'll cover your chest and
shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster I eagerly romped in mud, but as an adult,
submerging my body in the stuff was quite another thing. I eased into
the experience cautiously, sinking slowly into the tub as he packed
the goop almost to my chin.</TE>
<TE>   The mud is part volcanic ash deposited by a long-ago eruption of
nearby 4,300-foot Mt. St. Helena--which accounts for the red
color--and part peat, and the two are mixed with steaming water from
the area's natural hot springs. The combination is gritty and spongy
but not at all unpleasant. Picture yourself sitting in a bowl of hot
oatmeal, and you'll get the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Several times the attendant wiped sweat from my face with a cool
towel.</TE>
<TE>   The mud bath was followed by a shower, a hot tub soak, a steam
bath, a blanket wrap and a 30-minute massage. Afterward my skin
glowed pink, and I felt invigorated and ready for some serious wine
tasting.</TE>
<TE>   Defined by two modest, oak-covered mountain ranges, slender Napa
Valley is about 30 miles long and only three miles wide. In this
compact area, dotted with half a dozen communities, more than 350
producers are creating some of the world's finest wines. If you're a
wine buff, as Sandy and I are, the proximity of so many wineries is
exciting. So is the opportunity to sample Napa's noble product on a
budget.</TE>
<TE>   As part of our penny-pincher's tour we found wineries that, as
yet, do not charge for samples. (Many valley winemakers impose a
tasting fee of $3 to $10.)</TE>
<TE>   The best way to navigate Napa's plentiful vineyards is to have a
plan. Decide in advance to sip only white wines, for example, or only
Chardonnays. Or stick to wineries in one of the 14 officially
designated appellation areas. Other options: Visit the oldest
wineries, among them Beringer, Charles Krug and Beaulieu. Or head for
hilltop wineries with a view, such as Artesa, William Hill and
Rutherford Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Clos Pegase resembles the ancient temple of Knossos on the island
of Crete. Within its majestic walls and gardens are artworks enough
to fill a museum. To reach Sterling Vineyards' hilltop version of a
traditional whitewashed Greek village, we had to board a modern
aerial tram. The Hess Collection, draped across a steep hillside,
bottles its wines amid a fascinating display of contemporary
sculpture. Francis Ford Coppola has patterned the gardens of his
Niebaum-Coppola Estate Winery after Paris' Luxembourg Gardens.
Fountains splash, and youngsters launch sailboats in a sparkling
pool. Opus One, home of Mondavi's premier vintages, is frequently
likened to an alien spaceship.</TE>
<TE>   On our most recent visit we sought out small, little-known
wineries, which tend to be places that don't charge for tastings. One
that we especially liked is Dutch Henry Winery, on the Silverado
Trail just south of Calistoga. Now in its 10th year, the
family-operated establishment crafts premium wines in small
quantities. Its limited production of 4,500 cases is sold mostly to
San Francisco-area restaurants and to visitors like us. Scott Chafen,
who heads the winery, staffed the sampling table along with Buggsy,
his Airedale.</TE>
<TE>   Chafen guided us through five wines, beginning with a 2000
Carneros Chardonnay. It reveals "flavors of apple, pear and
pineapple," he told us. The grapes are grown in a single vineyard in
Los Carneros, one of the valley's appellation areas. A single
hillside vineyard near St. Helena produced Dutch Henry's 1999
Cabernet Sauvignon. This vineyard was cultivated to keep yields low,
"to intensify the flavor of the fruit." At the winery, a bottle is
$58. The sample, our chance to savor a mouthful of this fine wine,
cost nothing.</TE>
<TE>   We moved on to Vigil Vineyard, another small Calistoga winery,
which likewise charges no tasting fee. Vigil sits well back from the
highway, all but hidden by rows of grapevines lining both sides of
the entrance drive. As we pulled up, the tasting room and other
buildings reminded me of a modern, well-tended farmyard.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Randy Nygaard, who was staffing the tasting bar, guided us
through several Zinfandels. "Perhaps our most popular," he noted, "is
the Mohr-Fry Old Vine Zinfandel, grown on 70-year-old vines."</TE>
<TE>   He told us to look for elements of vanilla, cassis, berries and
spice, but my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough that I could
discern them.</TE>
<TE>   On another day, at the Franciscan Winery, we treated ourselves to
an hourlong lesson on how to blend our own version of a Napa Pinot
Noir. The tutorial cost us $10 each, but we had so much fun (and
wine) that it was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   My head can survive no more than three rounds of tastings a day,
because I would rather swallow than spit out (as advised) some of the
expensive vintages I might never otherwise get to try. So we had
plenty of time to take advantage of Napa's other diversions. Our goal
here, too, was to find free or moderately priced activities. We
browsed art galleries for free and took in a couple of historical
museums for nominal entrance fees.</TE>
<TE>   In Calistoga we stopped in at the "Artful Eye," an eye-boggling
gallery filled with offbeat glassware and other contemporary crafts.
Just outside the town of Napa we sought out Jessel Gallery, a barn
with nooks and crannies stuffed with paintings and crafts by 150
local artists, including owner Jessel Miller's lively,
impressionistic Napa Valley watercolors. Prices ranged from the
modest to the expensive, though browsing was free.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oakville Grocery, an old-time country store with
contemporary flair, one can almost make a meal of the free samples of
cheese, sausage, jams, mustards and crackers. One year we put
together a picnic lunch at the grocery and drove up the mountainside
to Rutherford Hill, where--after sampling wine--we spread our lunch
on picnic tables in the olive grove.</TE>
<TE>   In St. Helena we stopped briefly at the free Silverado Museum,
which houses what is reputed to be the best collection of artifacts
from the life of author Robert Louis Stevenson. In 1880 Stevenson
honeymooned on nearby Mt. St. Helena. On display is the writing desk
he used at his home in Samoa and an original copy of "A Child's
Garden of Verses," which he inscribed to his wife, Fanny. In
Yountville, the Napa Valley Museum (adult admission $4.50) uses
interactive devices to introduce visitors to a day in the life of a
vintner.</TE>
<TE>   We also took a look at one of the daily hourlong cooking
demonstrations ($10 per person) at the Culinary Institute of America
in St. Helena. On this day, chef David Katz, highlighting Italian
comfort food, whipped up a frittata.</TE>
<TE>   We visited Copia, the much-touted American Center for Wine, Food
and Arts, which opened last fall in the city of Napa. It was a big
disappointment. The center purports to raise one's understanding of
wine and food, but what we found was a huge building and not much to
see or do. For the one program that intrigued us, a 90-minute forum
called "In Love With Chocolate," $20 per person was charged on top of
the adult entrance fee of $12.50. We skipped it.</TE>
<TE>   For the money, the wine classes at Franciscan Winery or the
cooking classes at the Culinary Institute are a better buy.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of Napa's budget lodgings and cafes and its free
(or almost) attractions, a budget traveler can stay for as many as
four days on what it would have cost our lobbyist friend for one
night at his $700 resort. Whatever you spend, everyone can revel
every day--as we did--in lovely views of the valley. Which--need I
say?--doesn't cost a penny more.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Louanne Bergh's vision of Eden last April was
different from most: home to a fuzzy, freakish, bug-eyed visage,
shaggy on top and sorely in need of a nose trim. The South Pasadena
reader took this photo while visiting the Garden of Eden in
Hveragerdi, Iceland, 30 miles east of Reykjavik. While the landscape
was emerging from winter and still largely dreary, the greenhouses of
Hveragerdi were as verdant as ever, including this grass-covered
sculpture ringed by volcanic rock and potted flowers. Tour groups
stop to see tropical plants in a most unlikely clime--flora that
thrives only with the help of artificial light and heat generated by
underground geothermal fields.</CP>

<LD>It will be easier to explore Northern Ireland this year, thanks to
two new youth hostels and accommodation and transportation packages
for independent budget-minded travelers.</LD>
<LD>   The 68-bed Mill Rest Hostel is about three miles from the northern
coast at 49 Main St., 011-44-28-2073-1222,
www.hini.org.uk/millrest.html, in the village of Bushmills, which is
64 miles from Belfast. It can house independent travelers, families
and groups. Rooms have two to six beds, and the hostel has a kitchen
for guests, restaurant, foreign currency exchange desk and bike shed.
The lobby has a fireplace and lounge. Buses stop 150 feet from the
hostel, and the closest rail station, at Port- rush, is five miles
away.</LD>
<LD>   Just four miles from Bushmills, overlooking a white sand beach, is
the affiliated Whitepark Bay Hostel, 157 Whitepark Road, Ballintoy,
011-44-28-2073-1745, www.hini.org.uk/whitepark.html.</LD>
<TE>   Both hostels are close to many north coast activities and
attractions: the smallest church in Ireland (12 by 61/2 feet) at
Portbraddan or the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a 60-foot span that
bounces and swings 80 feet above the sea and connects to a small
island salmon fishery. The rope bridge is raised for the salmon
fishing season from April to September. Also worth visiting is the
town of Ballycastle, known for the popular Ould Lammas Fair, which
dates to 1606 and is held each year on the last Monday and Tuesday in
August.</TE>
<TE>   One site that brings thousands to the area each summer is the
Giants Causeway, a World Heritage Site of 40,000 basalt columns (some
40 feet tall) that stand in the sea, forming what look like
steppingstones for a giant. Most are hexagonal, created by volcanic
cooling and contraction. A legend says they were created by the giant
Finn McCool, who fell in love with a female giant on the island of
Staffa, off Scotland, and used the stones to step across the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Trails traverse the scenic, rugged coastline, taking hikers to
sandy bays, small harbors and castle ruins. Just east of the
causeway, perched on a cliff, are the ruins of 16th century Dunluce
Castle. In October 1588, just off the causeway, the Spanish ship
Girona was wrecked. Only five of 1,300 people aboard survived.</TE>
<TE>   The village of Bushmills is on an ancient route known as the Great
Road, which led to Tara, the royal capital of Ireland. Celtic kings
would have traveled this route, crossing the River Bush at this
point. Now travelers go there to tour the oldest legal distillery in
the world. Staff at the hostels can direct you to pubs in the region,
some of which host traditional Irish music sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The new 70-bed Bridges Hostel, 011-44-28-6634-0110,
www.hini.org.uk/bridges.html, which will open this month, is at the
William Jefferson Clinton International Peace Centre on Belmore
Street in Enniskillen. The hostel has an art gallery on the main
floor, a kitchen for guests, a restaurant, laundry, bike shed,
foreign currency exchange, lounge and dining room. Guest rooms can
accommodate two to six travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Enniskillen is 80 miles from Belfast and 100 miles from Dublin.
The bus station is within easy walking distance, but the closest rail
station is in Sligo, 45 miles away. The region is renowned for its
lakes, forest parks and nature reserves, where there are
opportunities to windsurf, canoe and hike.</TE>
<TE>   Independent budget travelers can explore Northern Ireland with a
Go as You Please Pass for about $116. It's valid for seven
consecutive days of unlimited transport on Citybus, N.I. Railways and
the Ulsterbus in Northern Ireland, including the Centrelink service
between all main bus and rail stations in Belfast. The pass includes
six vouchers valid for an overnight stay at any of the Hostelling
International facilities in Northern Ireland. However, if you stay
more than one night at the hostel in Belfast, there is a $4.25
supplement. For more details log on to www.hi ni.org.uk or call the
Belfast Youth Hostel, 22-32 Donegal Road, Belfast;
011-44-28-9031-5435, www.hini.org.uk/belfast.html.</TE>

<DH>A production team tries to respect the spirit of James
Agee's 'A Death in the Family' while turning the novel into a film
for PBS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer James Agee was only 45 when he died of a heart attack in 1955,
but his legacy includes "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men," his classic
1941 collaboration with photographer Walker Evans on tenant farmers;
"Permit Me Voyage," a tome of his poetry from 1934; and "The Morning
Watch," his 1951 autobiographical novel. His thoughtful, intelligent
film reviews for the Nation during the 1940s are still studied and
admired, and he also penned two of the best films of the 1950s: the
romantic adventure "The African Queen" and the eerie, evocative "The
Night of the Hunter."</LD>
<LD>   Agee is perhaps best remembered, though, for "A Death in the
Family." The uncompleted, semiautobiographical novel about the death
of his father was published posthumously in 1957 and subsequently won
the Pulitzer Prize. On Monday night, PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre's
American Collection" presents a new dramatization of the lyrical,
simple story.</LD>
<LD>   Set in Tennessee in 1915, "A Death in the Family" stars Annabeth
Gish ("The X-Files") as Mary Follett, a religious young woman who is
married to the carefree, charming Jay (John Slattery). Austin Wolff
plays their 7-year-old son, Rufus, who adores his father. Their
loving world falls apart when Jay is killed in an auto accident.</LD>
<TE>   Agee's middle name was Rufus, and that's what happened to him when
he was 7. The story chronicles the survivors' efforts to move on with
their lives. Directed and produced by Gil Cates from a script by
Robert W. Lenski, "A Death in the Family" also stars James Cromwell
as Mary's father, Kathleen Chalfant as her aunt and David Alford as
her brother.</TE>
<TE>   Gish has been an unabashed fan of the novel for years. Her parents
are both educators and she received her degree in English. "I think
it was such a good fit for me," she says. "I felt I wanted to do it
such justice."</TE>
<TE>   "She is a wonderful actress," Cates says of Gish. "To me, she
really represents maybe even an idealized version of what a woman of
1915 was--strong, resilient, capable of amazing pain and softness.
She was my first choice from the very beginning."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, "A Death in the Family" was adapted by Tad
Mosel for Broadway as "All the Way Home." That version was turned
into a movie and was later done twice for television. For the PBS
adaptation, Lenski went back to Agee's novel.</TE>
<TE>   "When you write a play, you are writing language that is meant for
someone in the 30th row to hear," says Cates. "Everything has got to
be said through the words--the emotions, the visual sense, everything
outside the narrative. So it tends to be a little formalized. The
wonderful thing about Bob Lenski is that he went back to the original
book and wrote this as a film. I think the writing is more
appropriate for a film than the play was."</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Lenski had such a reverence and respect for the book," adds
executive producer Marian Rees. "He never went down the path to make
[the screenplay] in one's own language. You can read verse and
chapter from the book that he incorporated and that he was faithful
to."</TE>
<TE>   Restraint was the edict of this production. All the characters'
emotions are kept close to the vest. "We wanted the characters to be
as true to what we think they were in 1915," Cates explains.</TE>
<TE>   "The book is divided into two pieces," says the director. "You
read 10 pages of narrative and then you read 10 pages of description,
which is italicized. It keeps going back and forth between the
narrative of the story and the description of the period. When you
read the description, Agee will talk about the people being very
private in those days, very much to themselves. They didn't [pour]
forth their emotional feelings. Everything was kept within, which is
one of the reasons I loved Annabeth, because she managed to convey
that sense of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Cates interviewed a lot of children to play Agee's alter ego,
ultimately finding Wolff in Los Angeles. "What a sweetie pie," Cates
says. "I just loved that little guy. We became really good friends."</TE>
<TE>   "Masterpiece Theatre's American Collection: A Death in the Family"
airs Monday at 9 p.m. on KCET. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be
unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Only the Clippers Can Blow Triple Playoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With three teams jockeying for playoff spots and seedings, every game
and every shot matters at Staples Center these days.</LD>
<LD>   That went double for Saturday, when the Kings played the San Jose
Sharks and the Clippers played the Phoenix Suns.</LD>
<LD>   It must be money time, because the big-money guy was in the house.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about faces in the sellout crowd: That was King owner Philip
Anschutz in town for a change and shaking players' hands in the
Kings' dressing room after their 3-0 victory over the Sharks moved
them into a first-place tie on points in the Pacific Division. The
reclusive billionaire rarely does interviews. He only had a question:
"How do you like those Kings?"</TE>
<TE>   What's not to like?</TE>
<TE>   They have the requisite strong goaltending; Felix Potvin shut out
the Sharks and came within 49 seconds of a shutout against Colorado
on Thursday night. Ziggy Palffy's racking up goals (two more
Saturday) and Jason Allison keeps picking up assists. They're getting
the numbers from the big names and getting the effort from everybody
else.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 14 games going into today, we've had 10 different
players score winning goals," King Coach Andy Murray said. "That's
good for those guys, to know that they can contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "[Palffy and Allison] are what I call minute players. They get
more playing minutes than the other players. When they're on, it
increases your chance of winning. It doesn't matter what sport it is,
your top guys have to be your top guys."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Palffy and Allison played the most minutes of all the
King forwards Saturday. And they produced.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys you're counting on to score your goals have to do that,"
Allison said. "Also, it's important that you lead by example [in] the
other sides of the game. Strong defense and sacrificing yourself for
the team and being physical for the team when it's needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't scored as many goals as I have the last few years, but
I'm trying to create goals other ways."</TE>
<TE>   For example, his hustle down the middle of the ice Monday night in
San Jose drew two Shark defenders and cleared the way for Ken
Belanger to score his second goal--of the game and the season.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if the Staples Center crowd wanted to reward all of the
season's effort Saturday. Take some time to acknowledge everything it
took to get to this point. They gave the Kings a standing ovation
that started in the final minute of the game and gained intensity
after the final buzzer. "These fans appreciate winning hockey,"
defenseman Aaron Miller said. "That's what we're doing right now.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to come and join in the excitement. We're the same
way. We love playing these games."</TE>
<TE>   Although injuries left the Sharks short-handed, they didn't look
as if they belonged on the same ice as the Kings, let alone in a tie
atop the Pacific Division. On Thursday, the Kings showed they can
compete at Colorado's level as well.</TE>
<TE>   After congratulating the players, Anschutz and Anschutz
Entertainment Group President Tim Leiweke walked down the hallway,
where they encountered Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry as he arrived for
his team's game against Phoenix. They stopped and chatted, and as
they parted Leiweke encouraged Gentry's bid for the playoffs: "We've
got the dates on hold."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, they'll give the Clippers until 6 p.m. the day of the
reservations to cancel, because their prospects of actually showing
up are starting to dim.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury and even the ghost of Dan Majerle
(he can't still be hitting jumpers in the NBA, can he?) made a series
of heartbreaking shots as the Suns beat the Clippers, 97-94. L.A.
fell 21/2 games behind Utah in the race for the final Western
Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The fans went through all the emotions. They booed the Clippers'
horrible start. They cheered their comeback from a 16-point deficit.
They moaned when Eric Piatkowski's last-ditch three-point attempt
missed and no foul was called.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were absent in the first half. Phoenix enjoyed a
steady mix of layups, open jumpers and offensive rebounds, while
three-fifths of the Clippers' starting lineup did not make a field
goal. It looked like the old days, when every reference to the
Clippers included the word "hapless."</TE>
<TE>   But the starters battled back in the third, playing so well that
Gentry rode the whole lineup all the way until the last minute of the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the injured players in street clothes (Lamar Odom,
Corey Maggette and Keyon Dooling), Quentin Richardson and Darius
Miles are banged up.</TE>
<TE>   Dragging an aching body through the final stretch of the season
and into the playoffs is just one of the lessons the Clippers need to
learn. Another is consistency, because this wasn't close to the same
48-minute effort they showed at Golden State on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I try to emphasize to them is it's a whole different
beast," Gentry said. "All the games are extremely hard. There's
really no margin of error for us."</TE>
<TE>   As well as they've played lately, the same thing goes for the
Kings, winners of six consecutive games. Lose six in a row and they
could drop out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But they're looking much more playoff-ready than the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   And how would Staples Center handle the scheduling if the Lakers,
Kings and Clippers make the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   "It'll tax us, but we're ready for it," Leiweke said. "We'll
figure that out. I hope it happens. It'll be fantastic for the city,
fantastic for the building."</TE>
<TE>   If the Clippers can't rally, days such as Saturday--when the
Clippers and Kings played the day after the Lakers--will be as close
as we all get.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Disney Officials, Watkins Meet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman interested in purchasing the
Angels from the Walt Disney Co., met with Disney officials Friday and
toured Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   The executives attending the meeting included Paul Pressler, who
oversees the Angels and Mighty Ducks as chairman of Disney's parks
and resorts division.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins and Disney officials declined to comment Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   In a November interview with The Times, Watkins ranked the Angels
"a close third" behind the Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Devil Rays
on his list of potential purchases. The Devil Rays last year retained
an investment banking firm to evaluate a possible sale of the
franchise, but the ownership group appears ambivalent about selling.
Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad has put the Twins up for sale, and
Watkins has reportedly made an initial offer in the range of $125
million to $150 million, but team President Jerry Bell has said
Pohlad would prefer to sell to local buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins has not withdrawn his offer for the Twins, but he turned
his attention to the Angels in recent weeks and is believed to be
prepared to offer about $250 million for the team.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Anaheim has no veto power over a sale, provided that a
buyer is approved by major league owners, and the Angels' lease binds
them to Edison Field through 2016. But city officials, who have spent
years trying to develop the land around the ballpark, are aware that
Watkins proposed a privately funded museum adjacent to a new stadium
in Minnesota and are cautiously optimistic that he might be
interested in similar development opportunities around Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said he would welcome the chance to meet
with Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want to know more about him," Daly said. "Based on what
I've read about him, he has the makings of a good owner. He'd bring a
lot of enthusiasm and business sense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Angels on Saturday, 4-3, scoring
the winning run on Jay Bell's eighth-inning home run off Donne Wall.
While Wall has been pretty good this spring, the game illustrated a
major Cactus League weakness of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star closer Troy Percival has pitched well this spring, but
the relievers responsible for setting him up have not. When the
Angels released veterans Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Mike Holtz, they
signed veteran Dennis Cook and said Al Levine, Lou Pote and Ben Weber
could get a game--and a lead--to Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Cook has pitched two innings this spring and is out with a bruised
rib cage. Levine, Pote and Weber have a combined earned-run average
of 9.24, with opponents batting .324 against Weber, .400 against Pote
and .412 against Levine.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that, without Hasegawa, there would be a different mix in
the setup role," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "But we have confidence
that those guys can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Starter Kevin Appier pitched well Saturday, giving up three runs
in six innings and making 101 pitches. He said he would taper to
about 75 pitches in his final spring start Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels sent relievers Bart Miadich and Dan Serafini to minor
league camp, leaving six pitchers competing for one or two spots in
the bullpen, depending in part on whether Cook opens the season on
the disabled list. Wall, a right-hander, and left-hander Mark
Lukasiewicz have been most effective among the candidates hoping to

<TE>   With two days off during the first week of the season, and with
infielder Scott Spiezio scheduled for suspension that week, Scioscia
said the Angels could start the season with one more bench player and
one less reliever. Spiezio has appealed his suspension.</TE>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Maybe Mo Vaughn will regain his Boston Red Sox leadership persona now
that he has returned to his beloved East Coast with the New York
Mets. The generally cynical and skeptical New York media have been
salivating at the prospect, ignoring Vaughn's abdication of his
anticipated leadership role with the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Like Vaughn, the Angels have moved on.</LD>
<LD>   Preparing to open the season next Sunday, they are excited about
the leadership Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele have provided their
younger pitchers and are convinced that Darin Erstad, Garret Anderson
and/or Tim Salmon--all of whom have grown up in the uniform--can
augment Manager Mike Scioscia's larger leadership, filling the void
Vaughn failed to fill during three injury-marred seasons in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Given the intensity with which he plays, his revitalized outlook
after an emotional divorce and the fact that he has slowly but surely
shed his North Dakota stoicism, Erstad is seen as the logical leader
among the players--even though his future is a bit uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   It will be recalled that the club's baseball executives traded him
to the Chicago White Sox in December but that Disney executives in
Burbank nullified the trade because they believed Erstad to be one of
the Angels' few recognizable players. He is unsigned beyond the 2002
season, however, and could be a free agent this fall, leaving the
possibility that General Manager Bill Stoneman might try to trade him
again before the July deadline if the Angels are not in the race and
it appears there is no possibility of negotiating a multiyear
contract.</TE>
<TE>   None of that is on his mind, Erstad says.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do his teammates seem concerned that his status could be
tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   As Troy Percival put it, "We may miss Mo's bat, but we won't miss
his leadership. Darin Erstad is our leader."</TE>
<TE>   No problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever tag people put on you is fine," Erstad said. "I don't
sit there and say I'm the leader, but I'm not afraid to say anything.
If something needs to be said, I'm not going to keep my mouth shut.
You can't force it because you have to be yourself, but you do what
you do and hope it's right."</TE>
<TE>   Too many Angel seasons have dissolved in lethargy and apathy.
Scioscia has the respect of the clubhouse, but Erstad believes
there's need for leadership among the players.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to police each other," he said. "You need everybody to
keep check on everybody else. You need to take care of your own
business, but nobody's perfect. Everybody needs a kick in the butt
from time to time. The nice thing about our team is that not just one
guy does that. We pick each other up from top to bottom. I mean, with
guys like Garret and myself it's just a natural progression. You keep
your mouth shut and go play when you're younger. The longer you play,
the more you see and the more comfortable you are speaking your
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a fabulous 2000 season--.355 average, 240 hits, 100
runs batted in, 25 homers--Erstad was unable to find any comfort last
season, when he batted .258 with 163 hits, nine homers and 63 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   An arthritic knee marred his mechanics. The dissolution of his
marriage to his high school sweetheart shattered his focus, his life.
Erstad is a former Nebraska football player who had always been the
first to arrive and the last to leave the clubhouse, but now baseball
was no longer important to him. He felt he was letting the team down,
knew he was, but couldn't do anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   "The most miserable year of my life," Erstad said, leaning against
a wall in a corridor near the Angels' spring-training clubhouse.
"Nothing close. I was brought up to believe that marriage is a
lifetime commitment, so it hurt to learn that isn't always true, and
I didn't handle it well. I mean, everybody deals with problems and
issues, so I'm not making excuses. I simply let baseball slip from my
radar. I wasn't there mentally. I just didn't handle it well."</TE>
<TE>   Some people knew, some didn't. Erstad didn't talk about it. At
some point, with the support of his family, resiliency took hold,
along with a new outlook. He went home to Fargo, relaxed with
friends, came west to see his Cornhuskers play in the Rose Bowl, and
now says he has regained his physical and mental health.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as excited as I've ever been about a season and team," he
said. "I like the change in attitude and personnel. I really think we
can be as good as anybody in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Those personnel changes included the additions of Appier, Sele and
Brad Fullmer. Vaughn is gone, and Erstad said he thought it unfair to
cast aspersions on a player who missed so many games because of
injuries that he couldn't fulfill expectations on or off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn sprained an ankle in his first game with the Angels,
diluting his 1999 availability and production. He missed the 2001
season recovering from biceps surgery. Some players wondered why he
couldn't have rehabilitated in Anaheim rather than absentia, why he
couldn't have made an occasional clubhouse visit to offer moral
support. Some never forgave him for dallying in the clubhouse while
teammates had a field fight with the Cleveland Indians late in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And there are historians--in and out of the organization--who say
he exerted his only real leadership in 1999, when he spearheaded a
misguided mutiny against the club's plan to extend then-Manager Terry
Collins' contract, triggering a tumultuous season that led to the
departures of Collins and General Manager Bill Bavasi.</TE>
<TE>   Said a person familiar with that scenario, "It wasn't only that Mo
pulled a knife on Terry, but he went through the backdoor, ignoring
Billy to go directly to [then-club president] Tony Tavares. I suppose
it's unfair to have expected more leadership, given the amount of
time Mo missed, but he wasn't the person the Angels thought he would
be [after investing $60 million], and his teammates didn't care for
him, no matter what they might say now."</TE>
<TE>   Well, what Anderson said after Vaughn had gone on Boston radio in
the off-season, saying he wanted to leave Anaheim and return to the
East Coast, was that Vaughn was out of line for going public, stoking
problems for the Angels, and if that was the way he felt, it was best
that he depart--good riddance, who needs him?</TE>
<TE>   It was blunt talk from another potential Angel leader, or as
Erstad might define it, a little more natural progression--and
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Big Wheelies</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona spring began tragically with San Diego Padre
outfielder Mike Darr, legally intoxicated and not wearing his seat
beat, losing his life when he lost control of his SUV, but that
doesn't seem to have made any impact.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, teammate Phil Nevin required stitches in his
elbow after spilling on his motorcycle. Nevin has a contract clause
limiting his use of the cycle, but how was Manager Bruce Bochy in
position to discipline him, considering that Bochy began last season
in a leg cast after a similar spill on his cycle?</TE>
<TE>   Now it has become evident that San Francisco Giant second baseman
Jeff Kent didn't break a wrist by falling off his truck while washing
it.</TE>
<TE>   Police reports and witness accounts indicate he broke it after
losing control of his motorcycle while doing wheelies on Hayden Road,
one of Scottsdale's busiest streets.</TE>
<TE>   Kent hasn't confirmed or denied whether he was riding the
motorcycle. He acknowledges that contracts are structured to limit
players from doing dangerous things that could injure the player and
hurt his team but said, "If you're going to restrict a player from
living, then I think that's unfair too."</TE>
<TE>   Unfair? Get real.</TE>
<TE>   How unfair is it, considering the Giants are paying Kent $6
million a year, to ask that he report to work healthy and productive?</TE>
<TE>   As General Manager Brian Sabean noted, there's a difference
between simply riding a motorcycle and "popping wheelies," but
whether the Giants exercise their right to fine Kent $33,000 for
every regular-season game he misses is doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   Sabean said he is more concerned with ensuring his players not
take unnecessary risks, adding, "This is a great lesson. There's a
difference between partaking in whatever your fun is and being
careless."</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't a $33,000-per-game fine make it a more emphatic lesson?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Who Got Away</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger farm and scouting system has been ridiculed over the
last 20 years for bad draft selections and a lack of productivity.
However, the list of players traded out of the system who became big
league stars or enhanced their careers elsewhere is staggering.</TE>
<TE>   It includes Pedro Martinez, John Wetteland, Paul Konerko, Dave
Stewart, Henry Rodriguez, Rick Sutcliffe, Mariano Duncan, Jose
Offerman and John Franco.</TE>
<TE>   The home-grown Henry Blanco, a part-time catcher with the Dodgers
in 1997, is another who had to leave before establishing his career.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco left as a free agent with little fanfare in 1998, signed
with Colorado, was traded to Milwaukee for the 2001 season and joined
the Atlanta Braves in a trade Wednesday. He will replace Eddie Perez
as Greg Maddux's personal catcher and otherwise will back up Javier
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco's name is seldom mentioned, but he led the National League
in throwing out 30 of 71 potential base stealers last year, and
Atlanta General Manager John Schuerholz said, "He's the best
defensive catcher in all of baseball. To add him to a guy with Javy
Lopez's production brings strength and protection at that position."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And Howe?</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics extended General Manager Billy Beane's
contract through the 2008 season Tuesday but did nothing about
Manager Art Howe, who has led the A's to the playoffs in each of the
last two years but is signed only through the 2002 season. There is
speculation that Beane refused to let bench coach Ken Macha interview
for the Boston Red Sox managerial job to keep him available in case
the Beane-Howe relationship, never close, deteriorates further.</TE>
<TE>   Is Howe frustrated?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I think it's fair to say that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Season</TE>
<TE>   All you need to know about the Cincinnati Reds is that Joey
Hamilton, who was 6-10 with Toronto and Cincinnati last year and went
to camp as a nonroster pitcher with a minor league contract, will be
their opening-day pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone from no shot to longshot to big shot," said Hamilton,
who will make $500,000 as the ace of a bargain-basement rotation that
will include 17-game loser Jimmy Haynes ($500,000), Chris Reitsma
($240,000), Jose Acevedo ($225,000) and Elmer Dessens ($1.825
million).</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every other club has at least one starter making more
than the $3.39 million the Reds are paying their entire rotation.</TE>

<HD>Padres Trade Jackson to Tigers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Padres traded infielder Damian Jackson and catcher Matt
Walbeck to the Detroit Tigers on Saturday for catcher Javier Cardona
and outfielder Rich Gomez.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson hit .241 with four home runs and 38 runs batted in, and
stole 23 bases last season for the Padres.</LD>
<LD>   "When a trade like this happens, you have to look at it like
somebody wanted you, not that you weren't wanted because you'll drive
yourself crazy," Jackson said. "We'll see."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, 28, had a .986 fielding percentage at second base. He
also has played shortstop and outfield in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Walbeck, 32, spent almost the entire 2001 season in triple A. He
singled for Philadelphia in his only major league at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Walbeck also has played for Detroit, the Chicago Cubs, Minnesota
and the Angels. He had been in the Padre camp as a nonroster invitee.</TE>
<TE>   Cardona, 26, hit .260 with one homer and 10 RBIs in 46 games for
the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, 25, hit .269 with 14 homers, 44 RBIs and 26 stolen bases
for double-A Erie.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also announced that right-hander Kevin Jarvis will
start the season opener against the defending World Series champion
Arizona Diamondbacks on April 1.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis was 12-11 with a 4.79 earned-run average and 133 strikeouts
in 1931/3 innings last year, his first with the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met catcher Mike Piazza left Saturday's game at Jupiter,
Fla., in the first inning after being hit by a pitch in the left
thigh by Britt Reames of the Montreal Expos, and was listed as
day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like it hit him on the hipbone and sent a stinger down
his leg," Manager Bobby Valentine said. "He'll probably play [today]
unless he's sore. It's a bruise, which is probably better than if he
was hit in a muscle or a joint."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Rockies released veteran catcher Tony Eusebio.</TE>
<TE>   Eusebio, signed to a one-year, $550,000 contract in January, made
only one start in 12 days and hadn't played for five days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore Orioles put right-hander Calvin Maduro on the
disabled list because of a strained muscle in his right forearm, but
the team's fifth starter won't miss his first turn in the rotation
during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The move is retroactive to March 22, meaning Maduro would be
eligible to return April 6. The rotation calls for Maduro to make his
first start of the regular season the next day against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Piniella returned to the Mariners after tending to his ill
father and the manager immediately announced Seattle's rotation for
the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella, who spent the week in Tampa, Fla., with his father, said
that Freddy Garcia would start the season opener on April 1 at home
against the Chicago White Sox. He will be followed by Jamie Moyer,
Paul Abbott and James Baldwin.</TE>

<LD>Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post takes George Karl to task for
his contention that experienced white assistants are finding it
difficult to get head coaching jobs in the NBA because black coaches
with less experience such as Doc Rivers and Isiah Thomas are cutting
to the front of the line:</LD>
<LD>   "Now, Karl has been a fine coach for a long time in the NBA, in
Seattle and now in Milwaukee.... But anybody who has been around the
NBA for a while knows that while Karl is engaging, he often pops off
and says stupid stuff.</LD>
<LD>   "He singled out Rivers, citing that Rivers went straight from NBC
to become coach of Orlando. And, yes, Thomas did go from NBC to the
Indiana Pacers' top job.</LD>
<TE>   "Somehow, Karl didn't seem so offended by Danny Ainge going from
TV to head coach, or, more notably, Larry Bird going from the 18th
green to head coach of the Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   "What? Karl forgot about them, or did he ignore a pair of white
coaches because they didn't fit his rant?"</TE>

<TE>   Kim Murray is due to deliver in May, leaving open the possibility

Murray said.</TE>

<TE>   Proper perspective: Dan Perkins knows all about the Oxford vs.
Cambridge Boat Race on the Thames River in London--a grueling,
41/4-mile competition that tests the limits of athletic endurance.</TE>
<TE>   But after twice surviving brain cancer, he isn't fazed by the race
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "The Boat Race is an awful, terrible thing and it's really
painful," said Perkins, a member of Oxford's eight-man crew for
Saturday's race.</TE>

<LD>   At their absolute best Saturday against the Phoenix Suns, the
Clippers were uneven--brilliant at one moment and brutal at another.
At their worst, they were just plain bad.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, they deserved a 97-94 loss to the Suns before a
sellout crowd of 19,455 that seemed poised to celebrate the Clippers'
third consecutive victory. Instead, the fans trudged to the parking
lots wondering what this will mean to the Clippers' playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Good question.</TE>
<TE>   Matters are far from settled in the West, but the ninth-place
Clippers are 21/2 games out of the eighth and final spot with 12
games to play. They were 11/2 games behind Utah, but the Jazz
defeated Golden State and the Clippers performed a belly-flop against
the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, we play Utah two more times," Eric Piatkowski
said, trying his best to put a positive spin on Saturday's events.
"We're not going to get too down. It stinks that we lost. But by no
means are we out of it. If we play good ball from here on out, we
will be in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did not play good enough Saturday and paid the price.</TE>
<TE>   They led only twice, the last time at 8-7. They drew even at
64-all late in the third quarter, but Phoenix regained the lead soon
after Elton Brand's tying basket and kept it until the end.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski's three-point basket with 8.5 seconds to play got the
Clippers to within 95-94. But Stephon Marbury made two free throws
with 8.0 remaining, and Piatkowski's off-balance three-point try
missed the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no margin of error for us," Coach Alvin Gentry had said
before the game.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, he added, "That's a huge loss for us.... At this
stage, you can't afford to have games like this. It's going to cost
us."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers didn't need to be perfect Saturday. But they also
couldn't get by with a clunker and expect to win. Like it or not,
they are a target now. Teams like the Suns will be looking to play
the role of spoiler against them.</TE>
<TE>   And while that says a great deal about how far the Clippers have
come, it doesn't make up for a hideous first half that left them
trailing by 16 points at one point.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix forward Shawn Marion made an early jump shot and the
Clippers seemed to offer nothing more than a collective shrug as
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Then Marion made another.</TE>
<TE>   And another.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th consecutive sellout crowd at Staples Center groaned.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Clippers appeared content to watch Marion shoot
from the outside and dash past for easy dunks. By the end of the
half, Marion had torched them for 18 points on eight-of-17 shooting.
By game's end, he had 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   But there was more to the Suns' 49-40 halftime lead than Marion's
hot shooting. They outhustled the Clippers to loose balls, getting 17
second-chance points to only two for the Clippers. The Suns also
played stout defense and forced turnovers and, in general, looked
like a team marching toward the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Two things we look at are second-chance points and points off
turnovers," Gentry said. "They had 17 second-chance points and 15
points off turnovers. That's 32 hustle points as we call them. We
never got them stopped. Every time they needed a basket, they got it.
We didn't play with the sense of urgency that's necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers looked like a team heading toward an early vacation
for most of the opening minutes. Brand, who had 30 points in
Thursday's 20-point rout of the Golden State Warriors, didn't score
his first point until sinking a free throw with 1:13 left in the
half.</TE>
<TE>   If not for center Michael Olowokandi, who had eight of their first
10 points, and Quentin Richardson, who scored 14 points in 16
minutes, the Clippers would have been buried long before halftime.
Olowokandi and Richardson each made five of nine shots. The rest of
the Clippers combined to miss 17 of 21 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson would lead the Clippers with 20 points and Jeff McInnis
added 18.</TE>

<LD>Corey Maggette, on the injured list since Feb. 22 because of
dislocated bones in his right hand, was cleared Saturday to practice
with his teammates. It's possible Maggette could be playing again by
this time next week.</LD>
<LD>   But the Clippers' medical staff will wait to see how Maggette
progresses after several practices this week before allowing him to
play in a game. Maggette also is recovering from arthroscopic knee
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "I would never put him out there without a practice," Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "If anybody could do it, Corey could. But we don't want
to do anything stupid. We want to make sure he's 100%"</LD>
<TE>   Although the Clippers have fared well enough without Maggette,
winning seven of their last 11, Gentry said the team has missed his
tenacity and athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we miss what he does," Gentry said of Maggette, who
filled in for the injured Lamar Odom as the Clippers' starting small
forward. "Somebody the other day said to me that we're better without
Lamar. Lamar Odom is a heck of a player. We're not a better team
without a guy who is a heck of a player. It's the same thing with
Corey. What Corey brings to our team, few guys in the league bring:
competitiveness and toughness."</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, 6 feet 6 and 228 pounds, also has been Gentry's
defensive stopper this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We put him on everybody, from point guards to small forwards to
power forwards," Gentry said of Maggette.</TE>
<TE>   Tremaine Fowlkes has been replacing Maggette in the starting
lineup and did so again Saturday against the Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes has provided some, but certainly not all, of Maggette's
skills.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Odom and the Clippers are expected to soon determine whether the
versatile forward can play again this season.</TE>
<TE>   He has been sidelined two months because of a sprained right wrist
and ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, averaging 13 points, six rebounds and six assists, has not
been cleared to practice and it appears doubtful that he will be fit
to play again this season.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Move Goes Against the Grain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers took the final step Saturday to buck conventional
baseball wisdom and use inexperienced pitcher Eric Gagne as their
closer, trading workhorse reliever Matt Herges to the Montreal Expos
in a four-player deal.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans cleared the way for Gagne to fill the
high-pressure role despite his minimal relief experience, sending
Herges--the club's top candidate beginning spring training to replace
retired closer Jeff Shaw--and minor league second baseman Jorge Nunez
to Montreal for reliever Guillermo Mota and outfield prospect Wilkin
Ruan. The Dodgers said Gagne forced the issue with an outstanding
exhibition season in which his fastball has been clocked consistently
at 96 mph, and their roster-flexibility problems also spurred the
trade.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne has only started this spring, his closing experience is
limited to 11 games for the Canadian national team seven years ago
and most pitchers don't jump into the job in the major leagues. But
none of that apparently matters to the Dodgers, who believe the
26-year-old Canadian right-hander will be fine after a crash course.</LD>
<TE>   Others aren't so sure, and even Evans acknowledges the Dodgers are
operating outside the box on this one.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of the reason we [made the trade] is because of the
emergence of Gagne," he said. "He came into spring training with a
power arm, he has three [sharp] pitches and our staff believes he can
contribute [closing].</TE>
<TE>   "Are we taking a chance? Is this risky? Well, I'm sure some people
are going to look at it that way. But we also took a lot of criticism
[for other moves] that have worked out. Sometimes, you have to take a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Evans is definitely gambling on Gagne, who closed for the Canadian
national team in 1995. That's it.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne worked 12 scoreless relief innings with 20 strikeouts for
the Canadian national team in 1995, but he wasn't facing big league
batters with games on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I really don't know how many guys have
[gone through] baptism under fire [in the majors]," San Francisco
Giant General Manager Brian Sabean said. "I don't know if you can all
of a sudden deem somebody, without much experience, the closer."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are expected to ease in Gagne, having him share save
opportunities and setup duties with right-handers Giovanni Carrara
and Paul Quantrill. However, they hope Gagne gets comfortable
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been telling everyone don't count Gagne out of the closer
equation because he has the stuff," Herges said recently. "Without a
doubt, his stuff is electric. Who wouldn't want Eric Gagne closing
games? If anyone can do it he can."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts discussing the trade at a Cactus League game in Scottsdale,
Ariz., said Gagne has been one of the best pitchers this spring.</TE>
<TE>   His fastball has had good movement as well as velocity,
registering as high as 97 mph in a game, and the changeup is still
his best pitch. But Gagne has always thrown hard--command has been
the key this spring.</TE>
<TE>   He has not given up an earned run in 15 innings, limiting
opponents to four hits, striking out 14 and walking one.</TE>
<TE>   So why not keep Gagne in the rotation, considering his performance
and the Dodgers' potential deficiencies in that area? Because they
believe he's the only long-term solution on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always liked Gagne, and everyone has been talking about how
good he's been throwing," Montreal General Manager Omar Minaya said.
"He definitely gives them some different options that I guess they're
looking at."</TE>
<TE>   In commenting about the possibility recently, Gagne said he's
ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they need from me, that's what I want to do," said
Gagne, 11-14 with a 4.61 earned-run average in 48 starts and 10
relief appearances spanning parts of three seasons. "You just have to
do your job every time you take the ball. Start or relieve, it
doesn't matter to me what my job is."</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras was less enthusiastic, expressing concern about
his client's changing status. Gagne was supposedly competing with
Odalis Perez, another of Boras' clients, for the fifth spot in the
rotation, and Boras is confused about the Dodgers' thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "In spring training all last year and this year, Eric has been a
starting pitcher," he said. "There was never any indication he would
be used in that role, and he's shown this spring that he's on the
road to becoming a solid major league pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "If Eric's role is anything other than a starting pitcher, that's
certainly not something that was communicated to Eric and myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers plan to use Gagne for an inning in relief in
consecutive games this week in an attempt to simulate late-inning
situations, and he pitched in middle relief last season, but scouts
said closing is a different story. The Dodgers can't stage what Gagne
would face closing games during the season, and talent only helps so
much.</TE>
<TE>   "Talent helps, but the experience, the desire, the will to be out
there is just as important," Sabean said. "You have to have a lot of
courage and a short memory.</TE>
<TE>   "The hero today doesn't apply tomorrow. In a lot of ways, their
willingness to be in the middle of the fire all the time is as
important as their talent."</TE>

<HD>Herges Trade Is a Tear Jerker</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodgers send versatile relief pitcher to Expos in
deal that seems geared more to future than the present.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Matt Herges throws a fastball, slider and changeup, but he got a
taste of a wicked curve Saturday. This pitch was thrown by the
Dodgers, who traded Herges and double-A shortstop Jorge Nunez to the
Montreal Expos for reliever Guillermo Mota and outfield prospect
Wilkin Ruan, a deal that left Herges in tears.</LD>
<LD>   "I sobbed--I sobbed hard--every time I think about it, I well up,"
said Herges, who hoped to become the Dodger closer. "My heart is
absolutely broken. I'm in shock. I've got to sort everything out. It
twists your life around, but as soon as I come to grips with it, I'll
be excited to move to Montreal."</LD>
<LD>   The trade alleviates some pressure on an overcrowded Dodger
roster, it cements Eric Gagne's move from the rotation to the
bullpen--and most likely the closer role--and virtually assures
left-hander Omar Daal, who is guaranteed $5 million, a spot on the
team. But it came at a steep price and with a questionable return.</LD>
<TE>   Herges was a bullpen workhorse, a 32-year-old right-hander who
went 20-11 with a 3.30 earned-run average in 210 innings the past two
years. The setup man was also one of the most popular players on the
team, no minor detail for an organization that has stressed the
importance of clubhouse chemistry all winter.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the Dodgers received a hard-throwing, 29-year-old
right-hander who has been one of baseball's most hittable relievers
and will probably open the season at triple-A Las Vegas, and a speedy
23-year-old outfielder with no power who will open at double-A
Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   Mota's fastball has been clocked at 94-97 mph, but it has little
movement. His slider and changeup have been inconsistent. In parts of
three big league seasons, opponents have batted a whopping .334
against him.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 205-pound Mota was shut down because of shoulder
tendinitis last July. He was activated in September but never
regained his effectiveness, finishing with a 1-3 record and 5.26 ERA
in 53 games. Mota had a 1.59 ERA on May 12, a span of 20 appearances,
but he had an 8.33 ERA in 23 subsequent games.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball America ranked Ruan the Expos' 13th-best prospect, rating
his speed, outfield defense and outfield arm ahead of any other
player in the organization. But in 1,893 at-bats over five minor
league seasons, Ruan has only eight home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to make a decision based on now and the future," Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans said. "We really liked the two players
involved. If Mota doesn't make the team, he adds pitching depth and
will close at triple A, and [Wilkin] is a potential Gold Glove center
fielder with great speed. We need to fill in the gap of players
between the major leagues and the lower minor leagues."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have one of baseball's worst farm systems, so the
addition of prospects can't hurt, but the trade seems to do little to
improve the big league club this season.</TE>
<TE>   One benefit, though--as pointed out in the Dodgers' news release
of the deal--is that Mota still has minor league options.</TE>
<TE>   That will enable the Dodgers to demote Mota to Las Vegas without
the risk of losing him through waivers and to retain Daal, who has
attracted virtually no trade interest but gives the Dodgers a
rotation option should one of their starters get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers probably will open the season with a rotation of Kevin
Brown, Hideo Nomo, Kazuhisa Ishii, Andy Ashby and Odalis Perez and a
bullpen of right-handers Gagne, Paul Quantrill and Giovanni Carrara
and left-handers Terry Mulholland, Jesse Orosco and Daal. Reliever
Mike Trombley, who is guaranteed $2 million, probably will be traded
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Mota has thrown well this spring, giving up no runs on four hits,
striking out eight and walking three in five innings, but his chances
of making the Dodgers are slim.</TE>
<TE>   Herges has struggled, giving up nine earned runs and 19 hits in
nine spring innings, raising concerns he is not ready to become a
closer, and that he may not be as effective as he has been in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Herges will have an opportunity to close games for Montreal, but
that is of little consolation. He signed with the Dodgers as a
non-drafted free agent in 1992, toiled for almost eight full minor
league seasons before getting his first taste of the big leagues in
1999, and was hoping to play his entire career in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be like Eric Karros and play my whole career for one
team," Herges said. "Unfortunately in baseball, that's rare. This is
like leaving my family for the first time and going away to summer
camp. It's tough. I love everyone in that clubhouse. But that's
baseball, and that's life. I've got to stop crying and get on with
it."</TE>
<TE>   Once the tears dry, motivation will set in.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Evans," Herges said, "I will prove you wrong."</TE>

<HD>Brown Makes Pitch to Start on Opening Day</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIERA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The chances of Kevin Brown pitching opening day improved dramatically
Saturday when the Dodger right-hander threw 70 pitches in a 7-3
exhibition victory over Florida, giving up one run and four hits and
striking out five in 32/3 innings.</LD>
<LD>   Brown made a 26-pitch jump from his last start, when he threw 44
pitches against Houston on Tuesday, and he'll have one more start
Thursday to get his pitch count to 90 or so. That will probably be
enough to convince the Dodgers he'll be ready to start against San
Francisco on April 2.</LD>
<LD>   Brown's fastball was clocked between 92-95 mph Saturday, but what
impressed catcher Paul Lo Duca the most was the life on his fastball
and his curveball.</LD>
<TE>   "He was nasty today--his ball was moving all over the place like a
Wiffle ball," Lo Duca said. "And that was the best curve I've seen
him throw in a while. He felt great and wanted to keep going, and
that's a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca's best friend on the team was reliever Matt Herges, but Lo
Duca did not find out Herges had been traded until after the Dodgers'
game. Herges did not travel with the team to Viera.</TE>
<TE>   "No comment," Lo Duca said, when asked about the deal. "I don't
want to say anything right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Mota, the reliever acquired from Montreal, is from the
Dominican Republic, but unlike many players from that country, he was
not found to have a false birth certificate. Mota did have visa
problems last winter, though.</TE>
<TE>   Mota, 29, tried to pass off a nephew as a son on his visa
application, so he could get his nephew into the country. But he was
caught, and Mota missed five weeks of spring training in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve outfield candidate Mike Kinkade had three hits, two runs
and a run batted in Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Stars--1-1-1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--There is no denying the Ducks are sound enough defensively
to keep themselves in games. They just aren't effective enough
offensively to win many close ones, as they are 11-20 in games
decided by one goal. Paul Kariya has 13 goals in the last 18 games.
Right wing Patric Kjellberg, who has been sidelined the last three
games, is doubtful because of a sore neck. Dallas center Jason
Arnott, out since March 10 because of a sore back, could play today,
which would be his first game as a Star since being acquired from New
Jersey in a trade. However, right wing Jere Lehtinen, out with a
bruised ankle, probably won't play. The Stars, who are battling to
make the playoffs, have a six-game unbeaten streak.</TE>

<HD>An Identity Crisis for Terrapins, Huskies</HD>

<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Maryland is 40 minutes from the Final Four, yet its players still get
questions about Duke, which has been out of the tournament for days
now.</LD>
<LD>   Connecticut won a national title in 1999 yet is still considered
by some to be a one-hit program.</LD>
<LD>   "After Duke won the national title [in 2001], they were considered
a dynasty," Connecticut forward Caron Butler said Saturday. "After we
won it [in 1999], it was like we were one-and-done--it will never
happen again."</LD>
<TE>   No. 1 Maryland (29-4) and No. 2 Connecticut (27-6) meet today at
the Carrier Dome for the East Regional title. The winner advances to
the Final Four in Atlanta with a chance to leave a much more lasting
imprint.</TE>
<TE>   Both programs have accomplished much but want more. Both want to
be elevated to another level. Both want to win today's game like you
wouldn't believe.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like shooting stars," Connecticut Jim Calhoun said of
heavenly bodies, not players. "I think the greatest measure of
excellence is time."</TE>
<TE>   For Maryland and Connecticut, the time has come.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the available evidence, Maryland is the better and more
experience team. The Terrapins are a tournament-savvy squad led by
seniors Juan Dixon, Byron Mouton and Lonny Baxter. Maryland is the
team most aggrieved, knowing it blew a terrific chance to win it all
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland is stronger, wiser and has already defeated Connecticut
this season, by 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, you get the feeling this game could come down to a last shot.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a tough out," Maryland Coach Gary Williams said of his
opponent. "No one is going to intimidate Connecticut."</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies, in fact, have won 12 consecutive games and have grown
immensely since that December loss to the Terrapins. Connecticut
boasts only one senior in its starting lineup, forward Johnnie
Selvie, but its players are not about to cower.</TE>
<TE>   Example? Although Southern Illinois lost Friday, the Salukis
exposed Connecticut a bit when it decided to attack the Huskies'
freshman center, Emeka Okafor.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois center Rolan Roberts scored eight quick points
against Okafor and finished with 24. In Saturday's news conference,
Maryland players suggested they might use the same tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready for it," Okafor said. "They say they're going to bring
it on, bring it on."</TE>

<DH>A Troublesome Youth, Connecticut's Butler Has Turned Life
Around</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Connecticut star forward Caron Butler is an admitted neat freak. He
likes his pants pressed and his work space clean. He's what you would
call a perfectionist and it bothers him greatly that teammate and
roommate Taliek Brown could be such a slob.</LD>
<LD>   Where did Butler learn these valued lessons in etiquette?</LD>
<LD>   "Corrections, man," he said Saturday with a laugh.</LD>
<TE>   "Corrections," as in jail.</TE>
<TE>   It was a long time ago and it's a long story. Butler's young life,
in fact, has been a series of corrections.</TE>
<TE>   There were dark times when Butler spent dark days in solitary
confinement, pondering the indiscretions of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, Butler has blossomed into the next flower of
Connecticut basketball, following a linear trail from Ray Allen to
Richard Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, a 21-year-old sophomore, is nothing like the bad boy he
used to be. Rather, he is Connecticut's unquestioned star and team
leader, the guy all other Husky players lean on.</TE>
<TE>   Once selfish and self-absorbed, Butler is now so selfless his
coach, Jim Calhoun, sometimes has to beg him to be more assertive.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun tells him, "You need to dominate a game, go on an 8-0
stretch of just you."</TE>
<TE>   Butler is getting the message. Last week, against North Carolina
State, he scored 34 points in the Huskies' second-round NCAA
tournament victory. His stock soars with every step he takes in the
tournament. He was the Big East player of the year and averages 20
points and 7.5 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Butler has also become a disciple of Connecticut hoops. He stays
in contact with Allen and Hamilton and is proud to carry their torch.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been a great inspiration," Butler said Saturday. "You
want to leave a legacy like those guys did. This is history in the
making now. I want to be mentioned in the same breath as those guys,
and the only way you can do that is win."</TE>
<TE>   Allen and Hamilton know Butler is the next big deal at Connecticut
and make sure he knows it, too.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, after a distasteful loss at Rutgers, Butler
looked up from his locker stool to see Ray Allen staring him down.
Allen told Butler this could not stand, that Butler had to take over
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Since, Butler has carried the Huskies and has not shied from the
responsibility. "I want to carry this team on my back," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   It did not matter that he was a sophomore. At 6 feet 7, Butler is
a player with immense skills, NBA skills, lottery-pick skills. Yet,
Butler feels the need to contribute his part to Connecticut's growing
basketball lore.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, he received words of encouragement from Hamilton,
the silky-smooth forward who led Connecticut to the 1999 national
title.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep it rolling," Hamilton told Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Butler is doing his level best.</TE>
<TE>   If Connecticut beats Maryland today and advances to the Final Four
in Atlanta, Butler will have gone from Big House to Big House in a
strange circle of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Butler screwed up. Big time. He was 15, living in Wisconsin,
and got caught at high school in possession of cocaine and a gun. At
first, Butler got tossed into a jail with other adults. After six
months, he was transferred to a juvenile facility, where Butler
promptly got in a fight and spent 15 days in solitary confinement.</TE>
<TE>   After Butler was released, no school wanted to touch him. While
his mother, Mattie, fought desperately to find her son a second
chance, Caron flipped hamburgers at Burger King.</TE>
<TE>   He started hanging out with a different crowd, though, a better
crowd, and hooked on with the local Amateur Athletic Union team in
Racine. Butler eventually got enrolled at Park High and became an
all-state player in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   From there, he went to play for Max Good at Maine Central
Institute, a prep school noted for churning out Division I players.</TE>
<TE>   Good was a tough disciplinarian, just what Butler needed, right?</TE>
<TE>   Yet, when Good picked Butler up at the airport, he almost put the
player back on the plane. Butler was staring off into space,
appearing to be totally disinterested.</TE>
<TE>   Butler says now he was only scared.</TE>
<TE>   "All I saw was a lot of trees," he recalled Saturday. "Coach Good,
he was a pain in the butt, he said, 'I don't need you here.' I think
he was trying to test me."</TE>
<TE>   Butler stayed two years and became the latest prep sensation to
emerge from MCI.</TE>
<TE>   Butler chose to attend Connecticut, where he and Calhoun clicked
from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm in his office more than anyone," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   His relationship? "It's more like father and son," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Butler doesn't shy from his troubled past, patiently answering
questions in waves.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I can be a role model for players who have gone through
some of the same situations I've gone through," Butler said. "I want
to show I'm a real classy kid. I'm trying to prove that. What
happened to me happened when I was 12, 13 and 14. I got caught for
the things I did. I've given my debt to society, that shouldn't be
mentioned any more."</TE>
<TE>   Butler is trying to put his past where it belongs.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned around eight years ago," he said. "That's done."</TE>

<HD>Glinton Makes Quick Impact</HD>
<DH>Galaxy: Rookie draws penalty that leads to Ruiz's second
goal in 2-1 overtime victory over D.C. United.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about a brilliant debut.</LD>
<LD>   No, not Carlos Ruiz. Gavin Glinton.</LD>
<LD>   Glinton, a 23-year-old rookie from Bradley playing his first Major
League Soccer game, took a mere 39 seconds to earn the Galaxy an
improbable 2-1 overtime victory over D.C. United on Saturday night in
front of 20,602 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Sent into the game when overtime began, Glinton dodged into the
penalty area and was cut down by Milton Reyes, D.C. United's newly
acquired Honduran national team defender.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Noel Kenney pointed to the penalty spot and Ruiz stepped
up to blast the ball past Nick Rimando from 12 yards for his second
goal in six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with that," Glinton said. "You dream your whole
life about getting into a professional game, and to be able to get in
and contribute like that, I'm very happy."</TE>
<TE>   So was Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid, who almost saw the 2002 season
opener slip away from Los Angeles against its longtime nemesis. The
Galaxy outshot D.C. United, 14-2, but was trailing by a goal with
less than six minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the best minute anybody's ever played in this league,"
Schmid said of Glinton's contribution.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just something where we felt we could go with another
offensive player [in overtime]. We told Gavin to just go at them. I
think he showed what he can bring with his quickness and his speed."</TE>
<TE>   It was Ruiz, however, who turned the game the Galaxy's way. The
Guatemalan national team striker also was making his MLS debut, and
he was harshly treated by D.C. United, which showed its respect for
his ability by fouling him hard and often.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruiz took everything aimed his way and paid it back the best
possible way, with the goals that first tied and then defeated D.C.
United.</TE>
<TE>   "He's committed to scoring goals," Schmid said. "That's what he
wants to do. I really like him as a person because he's going to
fight and scratch [to create scoring chances].</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the goals he scored tonight. Whenever there was a
melee in the box, he was in the middle of it.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed that he can take a hit, as well, because he got nailed
a couple of times. But he gets up and he keeps battling, and that's
what our team respects about him."</TE>
<TE>   D.C. United, which played the last 50 minutes with only 10 men
after the expulsion of Bobby Convey five minutes before halftime for
a very late tackle that clipped Ruiz's ankle, took the lead in the
76th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Santino Quaranta's pass left Ali Curtis in a one-on-one battle
with Galaxy defender Danny Califf. Curtis' speed won the day and he
was free to fire a low shot that ended Galaxy goalkeeper Matt Reis'
hopes of a shutout.</TE>
<TE>   It looked as if D.C. United would be able to escape the Rose Bowl
with the victory when Ruiz took charge.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old youngster from Guatemala City, who glories in the
nickname "Pescadito" (Little Fish), took a pass from Ezra Hendrickson
in the 86th minute, held off U.S. national team defender Eddie Pope,
then turned and fired a low shot from about 17 yards that flashed
past Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring, the 5-foot-9, 170-pound striker ripped of his
Galaxy jersey, sprinted to the sideline and delighted in the cheers
of the much-relieved Galaxy fans.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a cracking player, a cracking player," D.C. United Coach Ray
Hudson acknowledged. "I saw a young Jaime Moreno [D.C. United's
brilliant but injured Bolivian forward] there, I think. He's a
wonderful acquisition for the league. He's an exciting, volatile,
brave player.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we handled him pretty well. I don't think many teams
will handle that kid as well as we did."</TE>
<TE>   But D.C. United gave the Guatemalan genie one chance to escape and
he took it.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're very pleased Carlos got two goals," Schmid said.
"The last two forwards we brought in [Mexico's Carlos Hermosillo and
Luis Hernandez], it took them a long time to get two goals."</TE>

<LD>   Untested and relatively unknown, Paulson, 31, posted a
three-under-par 69 for the third day in a row at Ponte Vedra Beach,
Fla., to build a one-stroke lead over Craig Perks going into the
final round of one of toughest and most exciting tests in golf.</LD>
<LD>   Paulson, at nine-under 207, will try to become the first player in
the 28-year history of the Players Championship to earn his first
victory at an event widely regarded as the fifth major.</LD>
<TE>   But it is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen players were within six shots of the lead, including
defending champion Tiger Woods, PGA champion David Toms, Mike Weir,
Sergio Garcia and resurgent Nick Faldo.</TE>
<TE>   If the names aren't frightening enough, the Stadium Course is
intimidating.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose your focus at any point, you're going to make a big
number," said Weir, who had a 68 and was at 211.</TE>
<TE>   Agony is always right around the corner on the nasty TPC at
Sawgrass, and there was plenty of evidence on a breezy, devilish
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   * Phil Mickelson took five putts from 18 feet on the 10th hole to
drop out of contention, and added a three-putt from 15 feet on the
17th.</TE>
<TE>   "Throwing away that many shots on one hole certainly hurt," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   * Craig Stadler shot up the board with three birdies and a hole in
one on the back nine before finding sand, water and woods and playing
the final three holes in six over.</TE>
<TE>   "It stunk up the whole day real quick," Stadler said.</TE>
<TE>   * Rocco Mediate was creeping up on the leaders until he drove into
the lake that runs down the left side of the fairway on the 18th hole
for a bogey. He finished with a 69 and was at 210, along with Jeff
Sluman (72).</TE>
<TE>   Despite back-to-back bogeys on the back nine, Woods escaped with a
70 and was in a large group at 213, still a chance for him to become
the first repeat winner of the Players.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to get the ball in position to make birdies," Woods
said.</TE>
<TE>   Paulson, who overcame viral meningitis at the start of the season,
will be paired in the final group with Perks, a New Zealander who has
the distinction of being an All-American at two colleges (Oklahoma,
Louisiana Lafayette).</TE>
<TE>   Neither has a PGA Tour victory. The last time that much
inexperience was found in the final group on Sunday afternoon at
Sawgrass was in 1996, and neither Tommy Tolles nor David Duval went
on to win.</TE>
<TE>   Only last year, Jerry Kelly had a two-stroke lead going into the
final round and failed to hang on against Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't surprise me if one of those guys comes out and shoots
66 tomorrow," Mediate said. "That's how stars are made."</TE>
<TE>   Paulson is No. 181 in the world rankings. The only other time he
held a 54-hole lead was at the Tampa Bay Classic two years ago, and
he closed with a 72 to finish three behind.</TE>
<TE>   Perks is No. 203 in the world. His most clutch performance was
tying for sixth at Disney last year to finish in the top 125 on the
money list and keep his card.</TE>
<TE>   "They're players that maybe not everyone is familiar with, but
those out on tour are, and know they're very talented," Mickelson
said. "A lot of players on tour expect them to win real soon."</TE>
<TE>   Juli Inkster, stung by a bogey early on the back nine, recovered
with an eagle two holes later and shot a two-under 70 for a two-shot
lead going into the final round of the Welch's-Circle K Classic at
Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Even with strong wind gusts that made for tricky approach shots
and putts, Inkster tied Annika Sorenstam's 54-hole tournament record
of 16-under 200.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz shot a 68 and Dorothy Delasin had a 69 to remain two
shots behind Inkster, the 1999 Tucson winner.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, the winner the last two years, made a strong charge.
The former University of Arizona star birdied six of the first 12
holes and finished with a 67, tied with Mi Hyun Kim (66) and Nancy
Scranton (72) at 205.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-player group at 206 included 1988 Tucson winner Laura
Davies (70) and amateur Lorena Ochoa of Mexico, a sophomore at
Arizona, who carded a 69.</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb, trying to regain the form that made her the LPGA
Tour's player of the year in 1999 and 2000, shot 70 to finish seven
shots off the pace.</TE>

<HD>Winning Filly Is Apple of Her Trainer's Eye</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Golden Apples comes from off pace to prevail
in the Santa Ana Handicap in 2002 debut for Cecil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in several days, trainer Ben Cecil probably had a
good night's sleep.</LD>
<LD>   After nervously waiting for Golden Apples to make her 2002 debut
in Saturday's $150,000 Santa Ana Handicap at Santa Anita, Cecil
thoroughly enjoyed what he saw from his talented filly against a
star-studded field.</LD>
<LD>   Last behind a dawdling pace in her first race since she was third
in the Matriarch on Nov. 25, Golden Apples, the 3-1 second choice,
closed powerfully along the rail under jockey Garrett Gomez to outrun
2-1 favorite Starine and win by 11/4 lengths. She covered the 11/8
miles in 1:47, completing the final eighth of a mile in less than 12
seconds to win going away.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Gary Tanaka, the 4-year-old Irish bred earned her fourth
win in nine starts and has yet to lose over a turf course labeled
firm. Adding the Santa Ana to her earlier victories in the Del Mar
Oaks and Las Palmas Handicap, she is three for three on firm grass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long wait," said Cecil. "It's hard when you've got
your best horse sitting in the barn, but it was worth it in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I was worried about the slow pace early on and it looked like she
didn't really kick it in when the others did, but she certainly did
at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "She is an amazing filly. I think she could be any kind. We've got
a lot to look forward to with her."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Apples could show up again before Santa Anita wraps up on
April 21. Cecil said the $250,000 Santa Barbara Handicap on April 20
is a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Starine, who had been on the sidelines since winning the
Matriarch, still has not won on a firm layout, but she did finish two
lengths clear of 7-2 third choice Astra, who was making her first
start since Aug. 18 and first for trainer Laura De Seroux.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey is the dominant rider in the United States and he is
also king of the Dubai World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Riding Street Cry for the first time in the $6-million Cup, which
was run for the seventh time on Saturday in the United Arab Emirates,
Bailey and the 4-year-old Machiavellian colt easily won the Group I,
dominating longshot Sei Mi, 3-5 favorite Sahkee and eight others.</TE>
<TE>   This was the fourth World Cup victory for Bailey and his second in
a row after he had won last year with Captain Steve. Street Cry, the
4-1 second choice owned by Godolphin Racing Inc., scored for the
fourth time in 10 starts. The Irish-bred has never been worse than
third and completed the 11/4 miles in 2:01, winning by 41/4 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the evening, Americans had their share of success. Grey
Memo gave 80-year-old trainer Warren Stute his first victory in a
$1-million race when he rallied from far off the pace under jockey
Gary Stevens to win the Godolphin Mile by 31/2 lengths in 1:363/5.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of two victories on the card for Stevens. He rode
Caller One ($8.40) to a repeat win in the $2-million Golden Shaheen,
edging California-bred Echo Eddie and Patrick Valenzuela. Favored
Xtra Heat was third and Men's Exclusive, ridden by Martin Pedroza,
was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Terre A Terre, an 11-1 shot, held off Noverre to win the
$2-million Duty Free at 11/8 miles on the turf. Val Royal, the
Breeders' Cup Mile winner for trainer Julio Canani and owner David
Milch, mounted a threat, but lost his punch late and wound up fifth
in the 16-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   In the other two races, Nayef won the $2-million Sheema Classic
for his fifth victory in a row and Essence Of Dubai ran down Total
Impact, ridden by Stevens, to win the $2-million UAE Derby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Tony D'Amico must not have enjoyed Saturday's $500,000
Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park any more than he had the recent
Louisiana and Florida derbies.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing Bailey and Edgar Prado win those races with
3-year-olds he used to ride, D'Amico saw Eddie Delahoussaye replace
him on Perfect Drift and win the Spiral, a Grade II, at the Kentucky
track.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-1 shot trained by Murray Johnson for the Stonecrest Farm,
Perfect Drift, a gelded son of Dynaformer, won for the third time in
six starts, edging California shipper Azillion by a neck with favored
Request For Parole a nose back in third.</TE>
<TE>   The final time for the 11/8 miles was 1:484/5.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pat Day did miss with Request For Parole, he won two
other stakes at Turfway, taking the $100,000 Rushaway with Mr. Mellon
and the $150,000 Bourbonette Breeders' Cup with Colonial Glitter.</TE>

<HD>Quinn's Style Can't Be Cramped</HD>
<DH>Division III: Junior leads Bishop Montgomery past Orinda
Miramonte, 60-55, for its third consecutive state championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>She limped up the stairs to the dais and took a well-deserved seat.</LD>
<LD>   The muscle cramp in Noelle Quinn's left leg had not faded at the
postgame news conference, but neither did the glow of winning a third
consecutive state Division III girls' basketball championship.</LD>
<LD>   Quinn had 20 points, 13 rebounds and six assists Saturday for
Torrance Bishop Montgomery High in a 60-55 victory over Orinda
Miramonte at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Nykia Peace scored 24 points and the Knights became the fourth
girls' team in state history to win three consecutive titles.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, a 6-foot junior who plays guard and forward, started
cramping after the game, but was flawless during it, scoring,
rebounding and passing with precision.</TE>
<TE>   "She reminds me of Magic Johnson," Miramonte Coach Darrell
Hirashima said. "She plays that multi-positional position. She can do
it all."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery led by one, 51-50, but made nine of 10 free
throws in the final 1:36 to seal the deal, perhaps a nod to the
importance of experience.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery (30-5) was playing in its fifth state
championship game in seven seasons; Miramonte (29-4) was playing in
its first state championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the experience of being here before helped us with that,"
Coach Lisa Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery had only made six of 15 free throws up to that
point.</TE>
<TE>   Miramonte trailed after three quarters, 41-40, but could not find
another scoring outlet besides Tori Markey, who had a career-high 28
points.</TE>
<TE>   Markey, who signed with Santa Clara, had 10 points in the fourth
quarter and was the only Orinda player to score in the quarter until
she fouled out with 54 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn will return for Bishop Montgomery in pursuit of a fourth
championship. "It's a goal for me to get back here [to the
championship] next season," she said.</TE>

<HD>Riordan's Rally Sinks Centennial</HD>
<DH>Division III: Apaches can't hold on to ball or lead in
final minutes and lose, 47-43.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It took Compton Centennial High four months to win 31 games and a
Southern California Regional title.</LD>
<LD>   And less than a minute to fritter away a state championship.</LD>
<LD>   The cold-shooting Apaches committed two crucial turnovers in the
game's last minute and drew nothing but air on a late three-point
shot Saturday during a 47-43 loss to San Francisco Archbishop Riordan
in the Division III boys' basketball championship at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The collapse came after Centennial had the ball and a four-point
lead with less than three minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "They made their shots and some big plays at the end," Apache
Coach Rod Palmer said of Riordan afterward, many of his glum players
gathered around him with tears in their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Things began to unravel for Centennial (31-2) after Darius Sanders
scored on a quick step underneath the basket to put the Apaches
ahead, 43-39, with exactly three minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's Marquise Kately--one of only three Crusaders to
score--buried a turnaround jumper from the baseline with 1:36 left to
make it 43-41. John Tofi's floating jumper tied the score with 1:02
to go.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial turned the ball over on its next possession, and the
mistake proved costly. Kately, who finished with a game-high 24
points, dribbled past Sanders, laid the ball on the rim and watched
it roll into the basket with 25 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "He kind of surprised me on how explosive he was on that last
play," Sanders said, his eyes red and swollen with tears. Then he
paused. "I let my team down."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders could no longer go on, burying his head in his arms.
Teammates standing behind him murmured "nah" in an attempt to console
him.</TE>
<TE>   The Apaches still had a few chances after Kately's basket.
Sterling Byrd appeared to tie the score at 45 with 14 seconds to play
after scoring on a drive through the lane, but he was whistled for
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Two seconds later, Tofi made one of two free throws to give
Riordan a 46-43 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Pruitt's rainbow three-pointer from the corner drew
nothing but the arms of Kately, who was fouled and made a free throw
with three seconds left to seal Riordan's first state title.</TE>
<TE>   Tofi finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Crusaders
(31-4), who became the first boys' team from San Francisco to win a
state title since 1926.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, attempting to become the first boy to win four
consecutive state titles after winning the previous three years at
Compton Dominguez, finished with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders was especially dominant in the third quarter, scoring 13
points on six-of-seven shooting as Centennial turned a one-point
deficit into a six-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Apaches went cold in the fourth quarter, especially from
behind the three-point arc, where they missed all five attempts.</TE>
<TE>   For the game, Centennial made only 33.3% of its shots from the
field, including three of 20 from three-point range.</TE>

<HD>Lynwood Has Perfect Finish</HD>
<DH>Division I: Nation's No. 1 team caps its season to remember
by defeating Sacramento Kennedy, 74-55. It's the first state title
since 1993 for Knights, who finish 33-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The public-address announcer was incorrect. So was the game program.</LD>
<LD>   But Lynwood knew the facts. The Knights were 33-0--not 32-0--after
defeating Sacramento Kennedy, 74-55, in the state Division I girls'
basketball championship Saturday at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's hard to mistake perfection, which has defined
Lynwood's season. Andrea Adams scored 20 points and Lynwood,
recognized as the No. 1 team in the nation, won its first state title
since 1993.</LD>
<TE>   "I remember when I walked in a classroom [before the season] and
told the girls it'd be a special season," Coach Ellis Barfield said.
"It seems like just yesterday. Look at us now."</TE>
<TE>   It was an especially meaningful victory for senior Janice Bright,
whose father, Robert Lee Bright, died Monday of leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kept saying in my head that I was going to do it for my
dad," said Bright, who almost didn't make the trip. "I felt like my
family needed me. But this team is my family, too. It uplifted me to
be here."</TE>
<TE>   Bright scored 14 points, making eight of 10 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We rallied around her," Barfield said. "Our hearts went out to
her."</TE>
<TE>   The ending was definitely better than the beginning for Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood trailed, 5-0, and had trouble containing Alisha Hicks, who
scored 15 first-half points for Kennedy. Still, Lynwood led at
halftime, 27-22, thanks to its season-long ally--balanced scoring.
Three players had at least six points for the Knights at that point.</TE>
<TE>   One of those players, Sade Wiley-Gatewood, fell on her wrist while
driving to the basket with 2:18 left in the half. She returned within
a minute. She scored 18 points on the night.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew she was going to get back in," Barfield said. "You fall
down, you get back up. That's our motto."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to get the feeling that Wiley-Gatewood, only a
sophomore, will be part of many more playoff games before the end of
her career.</TE>
<TE>   "We told Coach we were going to do it for him this year," said
Wiley-Gatewood, who compared Lynwood to another team that wears
purple and gold. "We're like the Lakers. Everybody comes out and
plays the Lakers hard. Now they're losing, but we're not going to
lose."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood put the game away in the third quarter, outscoring
Kennedy, 24-15.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a matter of time," Barfield said. "By the end of the
second quarter, we knew what they were doing."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood outrebounded Kennedy, 41-19, and had nine steals to
Kennedy's four.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy (31-5) became part of high school history last week by
becoming the first team from the Sacramento City Unified School
District to advance to a state championship game. In the Northern
Regional championship, a 59-57 victory over San Jose Archbishop
Mitty, 6-foot-1 forward Monique Smart Kidd had a team-high 19 points.
Against Lynwood, she had only seven.</TE>
<TE>   "They kind of took away our inside game," Kennedy Coach Steve
Matsura said.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, a sophomore guard, finished with 27 points for Kennedy.</TE>

<DH>Division V: A 72-65 victory over San Francisco University
gives Knights their third consecutive state title, tying Compton
Dominguez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The game was still minutes from tip-off, layup lines barely
beginning, when fans of Los Angeles Price High began chanting for a
three-peat, almost demanding it.</LD>
<LD>   Less than two hours later, they got what they wanted.</LD>
<LD>   Price became only the second team in state history to win three
consecutive boys' basketball championships with a 72-65 victory over
San Francisco University in the Division V title game Saturday at
Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Oscar Edwards scored 24 points, Paul Simon added 14 and Price, in
only its eighth varsity season, matched what Compton Dominguez did
from 1999-2001 in Division II.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely amazing," Coach Michael Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, a 6-foot-4 junior, had 10 rebounds to lead the Knights'
overwhelming 50-28 rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most high school players dream of winning three
championships," he said. "I'm living the ideal high school career."</TE>
<TE>   The Knights were living large after the third quarter, overturning
a 35-34 halftime deficit by outscoring University, 19-10.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been a pattern for us. I think they like those halftime
speeches," Lynch said. "We saw a little fatigue [from University] and
we wanted to get after them."</TE>
<TE>   Price (31-6) could have had a better record, but the Knights
forfeited their last two Coastal Life League games because they had
already scheduled too many games.</TE>
<TE>   University forward John Casnocha had 28 points, including five
three-pointers to tie the record for most three-point baskets in a
Division V championship game.</TE>
<TE>   University (30-5) trailed by 14 early in the fourth quarter, but
rallied to trim the lead to 67-64 on a layup by Alex Casnocha with 53
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, however, answered for Price with a press-breaking layup
with 37 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they're as good as advertised," University guard Ontario
Smith said. "They're one of the best teams in the state."</TE>

<HD>Westchester Takes the Title</HD>
<DH>Division I: Hassan Adams scores game-high 24 points, and
his two free throws with two seconds remaining help the Comets seal
an 80-75 victory over Oakland Tech in the state championship game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>They came out and energized the crowd during warmups with a showcase
of highlight-reel dunks.</LD>
<LD>   Showtime didn't end there, of course, for the flashy Westchester
High Comets. Brandon Bowman took the opening tip and hoisted an
alley-oop pass several feet over the outstretched arms of Ashanti
Cook.</LD>
<LD>   Brandon Heath received a technical foul for knocking his hands on
his head, a la Clipper forward Darius Miles, following a finger roll.
This list of flamboyant moves and needless mistakes went on.</LD>
<TE>   But with its biggest game of the season on the line, Westchester
tucked away its silly side and turned to a most unexpected
weapon--free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Comets made all four of its free throws in the final eight
seconds to hold off Oakland Tech, 80-75, in the state Division I
boys' basketball champion- ship game Saturday night before 9,928 at
Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to make your free throws down the stretch,"
said Heath, who knocked down two free throws with eight seconds
remaining to help Westchester capture its second state title and
first since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Tech's Kevin Moore scored inside after Heath's free throws
to make the score 78-75 with three seconds to play. But Hassan Adams
made two free throws with two seconds remaining and intercepted the
ensuing inbound pass to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the greatest feeling," said Bowman, who finished
with 18 points. "We've been trying to get here for the longest time,
and we finally made it."</TE>
<TE>   Westchester seemed like it had the game safely locked away when
Adams, who finished with 24 points, scored on a putback to give the
Comets a 70-62 lead with 3:17 left.</TE>
<TE>   But powered by Leon Powe, who scored 12 of his 23 points in the
fourth quarter, Oakland Tech pulled to within 76-73 on an Armondo
Surratt basket with 15 seconds remaining. Cook missed the front end
of a one-and-one free-throw situation with 13 seconds left, but Keith
Everage got the rebound and passed to Heath, who made his two foul
shots as Westchester pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   "We started slowly and it took us a while to get in sync," Oakland
Tech Coach Hodari McGavock said. "Once we got in sync, we ran out of
time. With five more minutes, it might have been a different story."</TE>
<TE>   The ending was especially difficult for Powe, whose mother was
found dead Tuesday morning in an Oakland hotel room. The 6-foot-8
junior picked up his second foul early and sat out much of the second
quarter. He scored only two points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But he came through in the fourth quarter, scoring on dunks and
powerful moves inside as the Bulldogs (28-4) got back into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to step up in the fourth quarter so we could pull it
out, but we came up short," Powe said.</TE>
<TE>   Heath finished with 20 points but the technical foul against him
late in the first quarter proved pivotal, keying a 6-2 Oakland Tech
run as the Bulldogs pulled back to within four points.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester (32-2) scored the first nine points of the game,
highlighted by Adams' scoop layup and Ariza's two-handed dunk on a
breakaway. The Comets' lead fluctuated between three and 10 points
for most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said the title erases the sting of the Comets' losses to
Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy and Fairfax.</TE>
<TE>   "Those losses [are] behind me," Adams said. "I'm glad we lost
early and didn't lose this game. Coach always tells us you should win
your last game."</TE>

<LD>There is no doubt the best race in the country today will be run at
the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen turfers are scheduled to participate in the $750,000
Explosive Bid Handicap at 11/8 miles and the Grade II will have a
definite California feel.</LD>
<LD>   Jockeys Victor Espinoza, Alex Solis, Corey Nakatani and David
Flores have mounts in the Explosive Bid and are riding for locally
based trainers.</LD>
<TE>   Designed For Luck, who was third, beaten by a half-length, in the
Kilroe Mile three weeks ago, will break from the rail under Espinoza
for trainer Vladimir Cerin and owners David and Holly Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Beat Hollow, who toyed with only five foes in his U.S. debut for
trainer Bobby Frankel, will again be ridden by Solis.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafan, who was second at 15-1 in the Kilroe, will leave from
post 11 under Nakatani for trainer Neil Drysdale, and Flores has the
mount on Suances, an English-bred who won six of seven overseas and
will be making his first start for trainer Darrell Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   The 122-pound highweight in the Explosive Bid is Hap, a 6-year-old
Theatrical horse who has won 10 of 17 for trainer Bill Mott.</TE>
<TE>   He will be ridden by Pat Day because Jerry Bailey wasn't able to
make the proper connections to return from Dubai in time.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the expected lineup are Northcote Road, who was second
in the race last year; Fan Club's Mister, Candid Glen, Even The
Score, Mystery Giver, Pisces, North East Bound, Full Of Wonder and
Chorwon.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bella Bellucci, one of the top 2-year-old fillies
in the country last year, will make her first start of 2002 in the
$75,000 Santa Paula Stakes today at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  The former owners of Quorum, including breeders Terry
and Roxanna Amdur. They hit a home run on Friday when the 4-year-old
General Meeting filly was claimed for $25,000 out of her debut race.
Judging by the way she performed, Quorum can't run much. She finished
eighth of nine at 20-1, beaten nearly 18 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  N.W. Jenkins. The trainer went zero for his first 41
at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the fifth using C Merrill
Run, Shabab and Pirata De Baile.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/180. Money: Previous Day/Meet

<HD>Trying to Outrun a Two-Man Game</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Hornish may feel outnumbered, but he's held
his own against Penske powerhouse coming into Fontana race today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the ongoing controversies in auto racing is the value of a
two-car team as opposed to a one-car operation. There are proponents
on both sides.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Hornish Jr., the driver for Pennzoil Panther Racing's one-car
team, thinks he is at a disadvantage facing Gil de Ferran and Helio
Castroneves of Marlboro Penske Racing's two-car team.</LD>
<LD>   Their battle for supremacy in the Indy Racing League will continue
today in the Yamaha Indy 400 at California Speedway in Fontana, the
third of 15 IRL races.</LD>
<TE>   "There's two of them and only one of me," Hornish said after
qualifying fourth for today's race. "The only thing is that I have to
do twice the work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough battle. Seeing two red and white cars in front of me
is a little disconcerting because you're trying to figure out how to
get by one, and as soon as you do that, you have to go to the next
one."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish, who became the youngest driver, at 22, to win a major
open-wheel championship last year, has been more than holding his own
against the combined forces of the 2001 CART champion, de Ferran, and
last year's Indianapolis 500 winner, Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   In the IRL's opening race, on a 11/2-mile track in Homestead,
Fla., Hornish lapped the field in his Chevrolet-powered Dallara. He
led 166 of the 200 laps and only two caution flags late in the race
allowed runner-up de Ferran and third-place Castroneves to finish on
the lead lap.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, on the Phoenix Mile, he finished third to Castroneves
and de Ferran after leading 67 laps. He might have won again but a
lengthy pit stop dropped him from first to eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything went good until we started to leave the pits and
stripped off first gear. We kind of sat there, pulled into second,
didn't really do anything, pulled into third and then it stalled. Had
to restart the motor.</TE>
<TE>   "We were awesome except for that. We could move in and out of
traffic whenever we wanted to. The Penskes no doubt set the bar
higher, but that's good for the rest of us. Our objective is to go
out and put on a good show for TV and the fans."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish and John Barnes' Panther crew has done all it can to put
on a good show and also keep the Penskes and their CART reputations
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Hornish, a former karting champion from Defiance, Ohio,
nor Gary Pedigo, one of the team's co-owners with former NFL
quarterback Jim Harbaugh, Doug Boles, Mike Griffin and Barnes,
expected the success the team attained last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I had a chance to win the IRL championship last
year; I was really surprised," Hornish admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Said Pedigo: "I didn't really think we would win a race."</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkable has been Hornish's consistency. In 15 races with
the Panther team, Hornish has completed all but seven of the 3,050
laps. He has won four of those races and finished all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam is a great driver," de Ferran said of his rival. "We watched
him through winter tests and he's as good a driver as I ever raced
against."</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran and Castroneves had surprisingly poor qualifying runs
Saturday. De Ferran will start 13th and Castroneves 16th.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we don't have the fastest car out there, but [today's]
race isn't about speed, it's about consistency," Castroneves said. "I
was flat the whole way around and the car is totally trimmed out, but
we haven't been able to get that extra half a mile per hour that
would put us farther up the grid."</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran echoed his teammate's feelings, but added, "It doesn't
matter where you start, because it's such a long race. With 400
miles, you can win from anywhere on the grid. Obviously it will be
difficult, but it's certainly possible."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Cheever, the 1998 Indy 500 winner, put an Infiniti-powered
Dallara on the pole for the first time in series history. GM engines,
either Oldsmobile Auroras or Chevrolets, have earned the pole in 53
IRL races.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes without saying that a very large percentage of the time
we did today can be attributed to the Nissan engine," said Cheever,
who also scored the Infiniti's first IRL win in 2000 at Pikes Peak.
"It was a big challenge to take on a company like General Motors.
This [Southern California] is the headquarters of Nissan North
America, so it was great to do it here."</TE>
<TE>   Cheever's speed around the two-mile D-shaped oval was 221.422 mph.
Jaques Lazier, with 220.909 in a Chevy-powered Dallara, will start
alongside Cheever. Cheever's rookie protege, South African Tomas
Scheckter, is third at 219.661.</TE>
<TE>   "The lap was quite uneventful," said Cheever, 44. "I had a line I
wanted to keep. I chose a gear that was a little bit shorter, and I
had to come out of the throttle a bit to make sure I didn't bang off
the rev limiter. Just imagine how fast I could have gone if I'd have
been full throttle."</TE>
<TE>   Rev limiters are electronic devices which cause a controlled
engine misfire if the rpms exceed the limit set by IRL rules. The
legal rpm limit is 10,700. The idea is to control speeds, thereby
increasing safety and controlling costs.</TE>
<TE>   Lazier, who lives in nearby Alta Loma, is one driver who doesn't
see the IRL season strictly as a race between Hornish and the
Penskes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never felt we were on the outside looking in," Lazier said.
"We're second and they're fourth, 13th and 16th. Right now, we're on
the inside. When you look at the IRL, most of the tracks are
11/2-mile to 21/2-mile superspeedways. From the beginning of the year
we've worked to maximize our effort for these types of tracks. Our
goal is to give John Menard his first Indy 500 win, and to maximize
our superspeedway package.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take this team against anyone out there. Though we weren't
where we needed to be at Homestead [finishing 18th], we made dramatic
gains in a short period of time. I'm very happy where we're at right
now. We're going into a couple of race tracks where Team Menard has a
chance to shine."</TE>
<TE>   Robbie Buhl qualified fifth in the highest-finishing G Force, but
just after completing his timed lap his car crashed between turns one
and two. He was taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center with a
concussion and was listed in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   Memo Gidley was named to replace Buhl in a backup Dreyer &amp;
Reinbold Racing G Force, but he will start last in the 27-car field.</TE>

<LD>Big-time sports car racing returned to Southern California after a
decade's absence Saturday, but Southern California didn't return to
big-time sports car racing.</LD>
<LD>   Before a crowd best described as nonexistent--there couldn't have
been 5,000 fans rattling around the stands, which seat
92,000--veteran Didier Theys and rookie Fredy Lienhard Jr. won the
Grand American 400 in the Rolex sports car series at the California
Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-car race on the track's new 2.8-mile, 21-turn course, using
portions of the infield and the two-mile superspeedway, was the first
major sports car race in the area since the 1992 Del Mar Grand Prix
and was the Grand American's West Coast debut.</LD>
<TE>   Theys, co-winner of the Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway
last month, and Lienhard, making his debut in the top SRP class,
drove their Dallara-Judd to a one-lap victory over a Crawford-Judd
driven by James Weaver and Chris Dyson in the four-hour, 142-lap
race.</TE>
<TE>   Only 14 cars finished, meaning there were nearly as many gaps on
the racetrack as there were in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the race was not without drama.</TE>
<TE>   The Theys-Lienhard car had won the pole in qualifying Friday but
team manager Kevin Doran decided to change the engine as a
precautionary measure, which meant the car had to start at the back
of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, starting in the only other sports racing prototype, sailed
into the lead but Theys had his car in third place five laps later
and the two big cars spent the rest of the race in a spirited battle.</TE>
<TE>   Theys had a solid lead on Lap 119 when he had to pit because of a
punctured tire, allowing Dyson to retake the lead. But Dyson spun his
Crawford a few laps later--for the fourth time--and that was the
opening Theys needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some problems with gear selection and it was jumping out of
gear," Dyson said. "I couldn't fight as hard as I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Borcheller, Ralf Kelleners and Bill Rand finished third in
an SRP II Lola; Chris Bingham and Derek Hill were fourth in a GTS
Saleen, and Paul Menard and Michael Ciasulli were fifth in an
American Grand Touring Corvette.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the first night race in track history, pole-sitter Jose Luis
Valera of Weston, Fla., won the 45-minute Ferrari Challenge for his
Ferrari of Houston team. Valera, who won the season's first round on
Friday, averaged 93.940 mph and won the 26-lap race by 9.353 seconds
over Ferrari of Washington driver Allie Ash of Great Falls, Va. There
were four lead changes, but none after Valera passed Ash on Lap 14.</TE>
<TE>   Third place went to Joel Quaid of Santa Barbara, driving for
Ferrari of Orange County. The race, originally scheduled for 10:15
a.m. but pushed back by early morning rains, ended at 6:21 p.m. under
dark skies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CART driver Jimmy Vasser, accustomed to driving cars powered by
turbocharged racing engines, is competing in today's Yamaha Indy 400
as a warmup for the Indianapolis 500, the IRL's showpiece. IRL cars
use normally aspirated stock-block engines.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still trying to work some of the bugs out and learn some
things with the IRL engine," Vasser said. "There are a lot more
similarities between the IRL and the CART car than there are
differences. One of the big differences is that the IRL car has quite
a bit less horsepower and more downforce. You can pretty much drive
the car anywhere you want....</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have the horsepower that some of the other cars had but
I think we have a pretty good car for the race and its 400 miles. We
want to get to the finish and play the drafting game.... We came here
to learn. We're not running for the championship, we're preparing for
Indy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Hill, son of Phil Hill, America's first Formula One
champion, was able to make his debut in Saturday's Grand American
sports car race, thanks to the kindness of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Because Hill is a rookie in Grand American racing, he needed
driving time on the California Speedway's new road course. But
because the Saleen S7R he was to have driven had been crashed
Thursday in practice, and hadn't been fully repaired by Friday's
practice-qualifying session, Hill was in danger of missing his
promised ride.</TE>
<TE>   So, with only 20 minutes of practice time remaining, Hill went
shopping for a car to borrow. He quit looking when he saw the Ford
Focus ZX3 that had been prepared for veterans Mark Underwood and Jim
Harrell to drive in today's Grand Am Cup street stock series race.
The cars could hardly be more different, the Saleen a high-powered
racing machine, the Ford a boxy little production car.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose the Focus because it looked like one of the best prepared
cars in line," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   He explained his situation to Underwood and Harrell, who allowed
Hill the seat time he needed in their car. Then Saturday, with
co-driver Chris Bingham, Hill finished fourth overall, first in the
Grand Touring Super class.</TE>

<LD>Riverside's Johnny Lathrop pulled off an upset to take the 50-lap
Southern California Auto Club Late Model Series feature race Saturday
night at Irwindale Speedway in front of 4,250 fans.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Burns finished second, 0.127 of a second behind Lathrop. Dave
Hessing, the defending series champion, was third.</LD>
<LD>   Lathrop led for most of the race, but lost the lead to Burns on
Lap 40. However, Lathrop tapped Burns on the final lap, for the
victory. Despite the contact, Burns was not upset with the result and
called it "tight racing."</LD>
<TE>   Said Lathrop: "I knew I had to keep the car going hard and I
didn't mean to tap him. We started the day off a little tight and we
stayed with it."</TE>
<TE>   In the 40-lap Vista Paint Super Stock feature, Darren Cheek needed
34 laps to catch Andrew Phipps and held him off to capture his second
consecutive race. Greg Benner was third.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Limeropoulus earned his first victory this season as he
caught and spun out Guy Tripp with seven laps to go, winning the
35-lap main event in the Modified 4s feature. Steve Rodgers was
second, Greg Tucker was third and Tripp finished fourth.</TE>

<LD>Left wing Craig Johnson, on the mend after eye surgery Tuesday,
stayed home Saturday night when the Kings flew out of LAX for the
opening game of a four-game trip tonight against the Phoenix Coyotes.</LD>
<LD>   Only the best-case scenario, Johnson said, would allow him to
rejoin the team for the last game of the trip, Saturday at Calgary.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to say yes, I'll be there," he said, "but it's an eye
and you don't want to mess around with it. I'm going to listen to the
doctor and see what he says. But until he gives me the OK, I'm not
going to push it."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, sixth among the Kings with 13 goals, said his vision is
"a little fuzzy but getting better every day."</TE>
<TE>   He was injured in the first period of Monday night's 3-2 victory
over the San Jose Sharks when Shark captain Owen Nolan checked him
face first into the glass. The force of the impact opened a cut above
Johnson's left eye and tore the retina in his right, which had been
damaged two months ago when struck by a high stick by Vitaly
Vishnevski of the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I couldn't see, I had no depth perception," Johnson
said. "I tried to play for like two shifts and I was like, 'Maybe
it's my head.'"</TE>
<TE>   Doctors, however, ruled out a concussion and, because of the
earlier eye injury, sent him to team eye specialist Dr. Howard
Lazerson. Lazerson told Johnson he was lucky the retina had not
become detached, an injury that would have required additional
surgery and probably would have ended his season.</TE>

<HD>Never Too Late for a King First</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They beat depleted Sharks, 3-0, to move into tie
for Pacific Division lead with 11 regular-season games left. Palffy
scores twice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way the Kings have played the last 31/2 months, it seemed almost
unfair Saturday to ask the San Jose Sharks to take them on with a
depleted lineup.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings already were 3-0 against the Sharks this season.</LD>
<LD>   So, with leading scorer Owen Nolan and five other San Jose
regulars not in uniform, it was little surprise that the Kings rolled
to a 3-0 victory and moved into a first-place tie with the Sharks in
the Pacific Division.</LD>
<TE>   Or, as Shark Coach Darryl Sutter called it afterward, "the
toughest division in hockey," with four teams within five points of
one another. The Kings have 11 regular-season games remaining, the
Sharks 10.</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy scored two power-play goals, rookie Jaroslav Bednar
scored his third goal in four games and goaltender Felix Potvin
stopped 17 shots for his fourth shutout, helping the Kings to their
sixth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   It's their longest winning streak since the 1991-92 season, when
they won eight in a row, and provided the final push in catching the
Sharks, who led the Kings by 14 points before the Kings started a
28-8-5-2 surge with a victory on Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also have won seven of eight and, after weeks of
fielding questions about why they've been so much better on the road,
they're unbeaten in their last six games at Staples Center and have
lost only two of their last 10 there.</TE>
<TE>   Their latest victory prompted a rare postgame visit to the locker
room by club owner Philip Anschutz, who shook hands all around.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough to break his silence.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver billionaire, who rarely gives interviews, declined to
comment on his team's startling turnaround, which has brought the
Kings to within three points of the second-place Colorado Avalanche
in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, were more than willing to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that impresses me most about L.A. is how strong their
defense is," said Sutter, whose team failed to convert in six
power-play opportunities. "It's not so much a team concept as all six
defensemen being solid. They block shots, they get pucks through,
they move pucks up."</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray was impressed with his team's killer
instinct against an obviously ailing and undermanned opponent. The
six players missing from the Shark lineup, five of whom suffered
injuries during the last week, have combined for more than a third of
the team's 209 goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were a wounded animal today," Murray said, "and when
you've got a wounded animal, you'd better kill it right away because
otherwise it's going to get you.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of games where teams go in, they see the other
team's lineup and they think, 'This one's going to be easier
tonight,' and all of a sudden the two points are gone and you can't
get them back anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who start a four-game trip tonight at Phoenix, made
sure that didn't happen. When their league-leading penalty-killing
unit wasn't stifling the Sharks, their league-leading power play was
burying them.</TE>
<TE>   "So many penalties against the best power play in the league,"
Shark right wing Teemu Selanne said of his team's six infractions.
"That's suicide."</TE>
<TE>   With Adam Graves in the penalty box for slashing, Palffy gave the
Kings the lead for good with 1:49 to play in the first period,
picking up a rebound and lifting the puck over Shark goaltender
Evgeni Nabokov for his 26th goal.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:57 of the second period, with Gary Suter in the penalty box
for slashing, Palffy again scored on a rebound, his 13th goal in 16
games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an unbelievably skilled guy," said King center Jason
Allison, who assisted on both Palffy goals. "He makes plays other
guys can't make."</TE>
<TE>   Bednar, recalled from the minors two weeks ago, made a pretty nice
play of his own later in the period, skating in alone on Nabokov and
lifting a backhanded shot over the goaltender at 14:41.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All 17,317 seats at Sacramento's Arco Arena will be filled today. The
voices will be loud, the energy palpable, the passion fierce.</LD>
<LD>   And sometime in the first quarter, after a dunk by Chris Webber,
or a rebound by Vlade Divac or a smooth defensive stop by Doug
Christie, the chant will begin: "Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!"</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, reeling from thorough beatings in Texas earlier this
week--by the Dallas Mavericks and the San Antonio Spurs--find
themselves back on the bumpy road again today with the stakes even
higher and the environment even meaner. They will take on the Kings,
who lead them by 11/2 games with 14 to play in the race for the
Pacific Division title and the home-court advantage that goes with it
should they meet in the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings are 32-3 at Arco, the best home record in the league.</TE>
<TE>   And this is hardly a one-year phenomenon. Over the last three
seasons, the Kings are 95-22 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Impressive? Laker forward Mark Madsen shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think home-court advantage is overrated," he said. "There have
been times when we have played great on the road and times when we
have been not so great at home. I think the fact teams have trouble
on the road is more a matter of playing the second of back-to-back
games, or coming in on a trip at 4 in the morning and having to play
the next night."</TE>
<TE>   Still, said Madsen, there is no question Arco Arena seethes with
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a tough place to play," he said. "It is the major venue
for hundreds of miles around. They don't just get fans from
Sacramento. They get people from all over that area. And attending a
Kings game is one of the big things to do in that town. So it's
understandable why the fans get excited.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't get intimidated by the emotion of the building. If
anything, it fires us up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to play in an arena with that much energy."</TE>
<TE>   The record seems to bear Madsen out. Although they lost in their
only other Sacramento appearance this season, 97-91 in December, the
Lakers haven't had a losing record on the Kings' home court in seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson also shrugs off the Arco factor. "We
still have to play," he said, "regardless of how loud the fans yell
or how much strength they give their team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker guard Derek Fisher sprained his right index finger in Friday
night's victory over the Detroit Pistons, but the injury is not
expected to affect his playing time. He shoots left-handed.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, swingman Peja Stojakovic (strained right hamstring)
and guard Mateen Cleaves (strained right foot) are questionable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

in December. His replacement, Hedo Turkoglu, had a career-high 31
points (12 of 15 from the field, including three of five three-point
attempts), nine rebounds and a career-high 10 assists Thursday
against Denver.</TE>

<LD>Patrick Mutombo scored 23 of his 29 points in the second half to lead
Metropolitan State past Kentucky Wesleyan, 80-72, Saturday at
Evansville, Ind., to win its second Division II men's basketball
championship in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Bethea added 19 points for Metro State (29-6), which has
played Kentucky Wesleyan in three of the last four title games.
Kentucky Wesleyan won in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Landry scored 17 for Kentucky Wesleyan (31-3), which entered
the tournament ranked No. 1 in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Metro State, located in Denver, trailed by four at halftime and
was down, 44-43, with about 13 minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense won this game," Mutombo said. "Defense is all about
desire. We shut them down in both halves and we forced the tempo. We
deserved to win and this feels incredible."</TE>

Temple on Tuesday at New York. The Tigers beat the Owls, 64-54, this

<KH>Today's Games / Midwest Regional</KH>
<HD>Oregon and Kansas Go on the Defensive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Oregon averages 85 points, third best in the country. Kansas does
even better, scoring more than anybody, 91 a game. For college teams,
that's a bunch.</LD>
<LD>   Yet here they were, the runners and gunners from Eugene and
Lawrence, talking about how important defense is going to be today
when Kansas, seeded No. 1, and Oregon, seeded No. 2, play for the
championship of the Midwest Regional.</LD>
<LD>   "The transition game is predicated on getting stops," Oregon Coach
Ernie Kent said, "so you can get out and run and that's the key."</LD>
<TE>   Said Kansas Coach Roy Williams: "You run better when you're
stopping the other team and getting the ball on the move. Whoever
plays defense and takes care of the ball will do well."</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks (32-3) are looking for their first Final Four trip
since 1993. The Ducks (26-8) are aiming for their first trip since
1939 when the Ducks won the title but when there was only a Final Two
instead of a Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't about history or not having any. This is about two
teams that play crowd-pleasing basketball. This is about two teams
driven by guards who relish the fancy pass and also the fundamental
jump shot. This is about two teams that won't slow down for anything,
about two conference champions (Big 12 for Kansas, Pacific 10 for
Oregon) who are filled with confidence and toughness.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's tempo is set by three guards--sophomore Luke Ridnour, who
runs the show with a dash of flash; senior Frederick Jones, who is
fearless, strong, athletic and exuberant; and sophomore Luke Jackson,
who is happy to settle for a three-point shot instead of a layup.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way Oregon plays," Kansas guard Jeff Boschee said.
"Ridnour is an exciting, play-making guard and Luke Jackson has good
offensive abilities."</TE>
<TE>   And Kansas' tempo is set by three guards. Boschee is a
sweet-shooting senior who can destroy a zone defense; Kirk Hinrich,
an athletic junior who serves as the point guard and catalyst for the
fastbreak; and Aaron Miles, a freshman from Portland, Ore., who left
the state because he wanted to start immediately and his favorite
team, the Ducks, were loaded.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, then, could be inside, where Kansas has
multi-talented junior forward Drew Gooden. The 6-foot-10 junior has
become the best power forward in the country with the ability to play
outside and inside. The Ducks offer 7-2, 320-pound Chris
Christoffersen, who is immovable but also immobile, and 6-8,
235-pound Robert Johnson, who can pound on Gooden but maybe not keep
up with him.</TE>

<LD>Dwayne DeRosario scored off a rebound early in the first half as the
defending Major League Soccer champion San Jose Earthquakes opened
the season with a 2-0 victory over the Dallas Burn on Saturday night
in front of 15,214 at Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   DeRosario fired Jimmy Conrad's missed header into the right corner
from 12 yards away in the 11th minute, and Landon Donovan added a
goal in the 46th minute.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose's defenders set the tempo, limiting the Burn to only one
shot on goal in the first 65 minutes. The Earthquakes had five shots
on goal during that time.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas' Ronald Cerritos faced his former team for the first time
since an off-season trade that sent Ariel Graziani to San Jose.
Cerritos had a goal disallowed in the 31st minute when he was ruled
offsides.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 1, Kansas City 1--Midfielder Chris Brown scored on a
header late in the second half to rally the Wizards in front of
11,769 at Kansas City, Mo. Preki delivered a near-perfect free kick
from 18 yards out to Brown, who headed the ball past Colorado
goalkeeper Scott Garlick. Brown narrowly missed on another header in
the sixth minute of overtime. Colorado midfielder Chris Henderson
scored against his former team in the 16th minute, off an assist from
John Spencer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York-New Jersey 3, New England 1--Revolution defender Carlos
Llamosa headed a ball into his own net in the 72nd minute for the

<TE>   Rodrigo Faria and Clint Mathis also scored, and newcomer Diego
Serna had two assists for the MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Columbus 0--Columbus defender Chad McCarty knocked the
ball into his own net and Josh Wolff scored late, helping the Fire
win before 18,450 at Columbus, Ohio. The loss was the Crew's first in
seven home openers and the team's first regular-season defeat at home
in 11 games.</TE>

<HD>Green Wins Busch Race at Bristol</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Green outlasted a battered field Saturday to win the Channellock
250 at Bristol, Tenn., a race that ended with Kevin Harvick and Greg
Biffle at odds again.</LD>
<LD>   Green survived a record-tying 14 cautions and a final shootout
after a red flag to win his 15th career Busch series event. Mike
McLaughlin was second and was followed by Scott Wimmer, Jimmy Spencer
and Biffle.</LD>
<LD>   The race was stopped with nine laps to go after Biffle and Harvick
got into each other in Turn 4. The crash wrecked Harvick's car.</LD>
<TE>   The two were racing for fifth place and fighting for track
position when Biffle bumped the back of Harvick's left rear, sending
his Chevrolet hard into the outside wall, then back across traffic
before he came to rest on the front stretch.</TE>
<TE>   As he headed to the care center for a checkup, Harvick let it
known he wasn't happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said Greg Biffle was a good guy, but he's the most
impatient thing I've ever seen," said Harvick, who won the Busch
series title last season. "He comes and just rams me in the [rear],
pretty much puts us in the fence and ruins a brand-new race car."</TE>
<TE>   Biffle claimed he wasn't at fault for the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "He was getting really loose," Biffle said. "I was back on him
there, and he just got loose. He had to check out of the throttle. He
knows he did, and I bumped him a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time the two have had a confrontation and some
of their run-ins were highlights of the Busch series last season.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Green, brother of the race winner, was taken to a nearby
hospital with a foot injury after his wreck on the final lap of the
race.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Carmichael won his fifth consecutive 250cc EA SPORTS
Supercross race, beating Nathan Ramsey in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "Nathan made me work for this one," Carmichael said. "I tried to
get by cleanly, but I knew I was going to have to mix it up if I
wanted to take over the lead. I dove inside of him and it paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael, who rides a Honda, leads the season standings with 234
points. David Vuillemin, fourth Saturday, is second with 217.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Walker won his first 125cc Western Regional Supercross race.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Denver Nuggets finally found some focus at the end of a game and
ended their longest losing streak of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Juwan Howard had 22 points and 10 rebounds, and hit a jump hook
with 35 seconds left as the Nuggets ended their losing streak at
seven with an 88-85 victory Saturday night over the Seattle
SuperSonics at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "We are playing against teams now that are playoff teams, and we
can beat them," Denver's George McCloud said. "Lately we have lost
focus near the ends of games, but tonight we got back on the right
track."</LD>
<TE>   But Denver, already struggling with injuries, lost point guard Tim
Hardaway for the remainder of the season after he broke his left foot
in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway had seven points in the first three minutes but hopped
off the court and to the locker room after Randy Livingston stepped
on his foot with 3:24 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway came to Denver in a seven-player trade with Dallas on
Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really concerned about Tim because he had worked real
hard to get himself into shape to play," Denver Coach Mike Evans
said. "That was the first thing he said when he came here, that he
wasn't in the condition he needed to be in to be a starter. It's sad
to see him go out like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 108, Minnesota 99--Damon Stoudamire scored 21 points and
Scottie Pippen had 18--13 in the fourth quarter--as the Trail Blazers
defeated the Timberwolves at Minneapolis to move ahead of Minnesota
in the Western Conference standings.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 23 points to lead the Timberwolves, who have
lost eight of 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 111, Memphis 100--Dirk Nowitzki scored 24 points and
Michael Finley had 13 at Dallas to surpass 10,000 for his career as
the Mavericks completed a four-game season series sweep of the
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Finley became the 238th NBA player to reach 10,000 points with an
18-foot jumper in the final minute of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 112, Golden State 103--Donyell Marshall scored 25 points at
Salt Lake City as the Jazz earned their 22nd victory in 23 games
against the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone added 24 points, 12 rebounds and six steals for Utah,
which has won four of five to strengthen its hold on the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 89, Miami 79--Tim Duncan had 23 points and 11 rebounds
at San Antonio to lead the Spurs to their 12th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Five Spurs scored in double figures to extend the NBA's longest
current winning streak. San Antonio went on a 16-6 run to end the
third quarter and take command.</TE>

<TE>   Atlanta 112, Chicago 96--Jason Terry scored 23 points and matched
a career-high with 13 assists as the Hawks won at Atlanta.</TE>

<LD>Donald T. Sterling</LD>
<LD>   Sterling World Plaza</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills, CA</LD>
<TE>   Dear Donald,</TE>
<TE>   What can I say but congratulations! You told me you could do it
and you did, even if it did take a while.</TE>
<TE>   Those are your Clippers, suddenly the NBA's hot story with their
own weekly MTV-like show on ESPN, in between segments on your
cheerleader who's still a Vegas chorus girl (on stage, of course) and
Jimmy Goldstein's wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about your dream seasons. Forget the playoffs, no one thought
you'd make it anyway. It's nice you're even in the race and nicer
that you came on late.</TE>
<TE>   How about a season-ending 16-game sellout streak? That didn't
happen even in your Larry Brown Interlude in the '90s, which, until
this season, was your only finish above .500 since you bought the
team in the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   What could go wrong now?</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course, there's the usual. Unfortunately, as Clipper fans
know, you're going to have a part to play in this.</TE>
<TE>   You, personally, haven't actually done anything. Your new fortune
flows from 1) Elgin Baylor's calls, 2) the rules changes that gave
you control of rookies for five years instead of three, and 3) luck.</TE>
<TE>   Two summers ago, Orlando gave you Corey Maggette and Keyon Dooling
to take Derek Strong's $3-million salary off its hands. Last spring,
you had the eighth worst record, drew the No. 2 pick and the Bulls
gave you Elton Brand to get Tyson Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   With the talent on hand--Lamar Odom, Michael Olowokandi, Darius
Miles, Quentin Richardson--you were no longer the 66-loss wretches of
1999. (Remember when you waited till after the lockout to hire Chris
Ford to save salary? How about Jim Todd?)</TE>
<TE>   Nor was a vast outlay required. Your payroll is still the NBA's
lowest at $34.2 million, $8.3 million under the cap, but those days
are coming to an end, fast.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Olowokandi is a restricted free agent and, unless
secured, he'll be free in 2003 (kind of has a ring to it, doesn't
it?)</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McInnis, your point guard, is through in '02.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, Odom and Maggette are eligible for extensions this summer
and could go out the door in '04.</TE>
<TE>   The Miles-Richardson tandem will be eligible for extensions in '03
and could find new lives in '05. To paraphrase Paul Simon, there must
be 50 million ways to leave the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   The other general managers are saying you won't sign them all,
which is why they're looking at your roster as if it's a smorgasbord.
I know, people can be so mean. You've always said you'd pay for the
real deal, why doesn't anyone believe you?</TE>
<TE>   But I know this won't be easy for you, or fun, or perhaps
possible, so, as always, I'm willing to help:</TE>
<TE>   * Brand. Better re-sign him if you intend to keep showing your
face around here.</TE>
<TE>   This is like having an All-Star power forward with a halo and
wings. He gets 18-12 every night, is a stand-up guy with the media,
says the right things, plays hard, practices hard, stays after to
work. You name it, he does it.</TE>
<TE>   , he says he won't commit to staying now, not even if you put the
maximum $100 million on the table. He wants to see what happens with
Olowokandi and McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he wants to know if these are your New Clippers or
still your Old Clippers. This raises a point you never got: These
negotiations are linked. Mess up the wrong one and the whole thing
can go.</TE>
<TE>   * Olowokandi. You have to re-sign him too, and he'll cost almost
as much as Brand.</TE>
<TE>   At 7 feet, 270 pounds and 27 years of age, there aren't any more
of him coming on the market. Several teams with cap room will be
seeking centers in '03, Orlando and Detroit to name two. Says one
insider: "If he doesn't get the max, he's going to be close."</TE>
<TE>   Happily for you, he says he wants to stay and might even take less
money.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to stay, obviously, within reason," Olowokandi says.
"I enjoy playing here and I've made that known, so it's now for them
to show me how much they do want me to stay here....</TE>
<TE>   "If it's close, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Unhappily for you, Don, you're you. I know it's not personal.
You're perfectly egalitarian; you don't like the idea of committing
tens of millions to anyone, regardless of race, creed, national
origin or species.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, your players don't have the benefit of your years
in business. Instead, they have a discrete window of opportunity and
lots of suitors.</TE>
<TE>   Your front office and Olowokandi's agent waltzed to nowhere last
summer, although for once, it doesn't look as if it got unpleasant
and messed things up.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Olowokandi notes, "At least not yet, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   * McInnis. I'm sorry, you'd better sign him too, if you want to
make the playoffs next season.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, it looked as though he was gone, his cocky motor-mouth
persona detracting from his play. Baylor has visions of Odom or Miles
running the team, but there's a difference between a guy who can play
the point and an NBA point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Your late push dates from Alvin Gentry's my-way-or-the-highway
talk with McInnis. Not that McInnis is going to turn into Little Lord
Fauntleroy, but he makes too many big plays to leave without being
missed.</TE>
<TE>   * Maggette. You should keep him too. He hasn't happened yet, but
he has incredible gifts and fits in nicely as gung-ho role player. He
was so raw his first two years, his coaches had to spot him. Now he's
one of Gentry's favorites. Two years from now, he'll be better.</TE>
<TE>   * Odom. Ooh, here's the tough one.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in Clipperdom loves him, but he has unresolved growing-up
problems. Even if he turns it around, he doesn't fit the way he used
to.</TE>
<TE>   Until this season, this was his team. Now they sock the ball in to
Brand and Olowokandi and need more shooters to complement them. As
Laker Coach Phil Jackson suggested, it's no coincidence they moved up
with key players out. And every minute Odom plays is a minute that
Miles, your other phenom, doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   If Lamar works out, great. If not, he's a blue chip you can trade.
Not to get too far ahead of myself, but there are valentines going
back and forth between your guys and Baron Davis, local kid, monster
talent and another '03 free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Amazing as it is, after a slow start--17 years!--you now have this
budding powerhouse, stocked to the brim with talent, camaraderie and,
rarest of all, all the size you need.</TE>
<TE>   Your players used to climb the walls. These guys are friends and
happy as a bunch of 8-year-olds at Chuck E. Cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, you'll have cap room in '03, so if you find you're missing a
piece, you can go get one.</TE>
<TE>   You could max out Brand and Olowokandi to $10 million per year,
give McInnis and Maggette $4 million, keep Odom, Miles, Richardson,
Dooling and Eric Piatkowski at their current levels, add on an
additional $2 million for three bench guys--and still be at $36
million next season, $6.5 million under the cap.</TE>
<TE>   And happily, for you anyway, since you get to keep the profits,
there have been some recently.</TE>
<TE>   Your net was reportedly in the NBA's top five last season and
attendance just went up 3,000 a game. Going without a TV deal worked
out wonderfully; this summer the broadcast environment should be
better and you have a hot attraction--with teen-saturated
demographics--to sell, assuming, of course, you show advertisers that
you're going to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   So here it is, crunch time for vous. In two years, you could have
a title contender ... or you could be back to what you've always had.</TE>
<TE>   This could be the Next Big Thing or it could vanish so fast,
you'll barely be able to remember it was here.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on this team when the team wasn't very good," Olowokandi
said last week, "and I've seen them develop and I can see where teams
can be a year from now, two years from now.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a shame. It would probably be the worst screw-up in
the history of screw-ups to dismantle the team."</TE>
<TE>   It would even be your worst screw-up, so do your fans a favor, for
once, while you've got some.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, whatever happens, I'll be here for you.</TE>
<TE>   As ever,</TE>

<LD>Tracy McGrady was released from the hospital Saturday, one day after
leaving a game on a stretcher with an injured back.</LD>
<LD>   The Orlando Magic's star guard will not travel to Milwaukee for
today's game, team spokesman Joel Glass said.</LD>
<LD>   McGrady was resting after leaving Florida Hospital and is listed
as day to day, the team said.</LD>
<TE>   "His return will depend on how he responds to therapy and his
treatment," Glass said.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady injured his back in the second quarter against Charlotte
on Friday night. He drove the lane and was sandwiched between the
Hornets' Robert Traylor and George Lynch. He appeared to land
awkwardly, and collapsed face-down under the basket.</TE>

<TE>   Allen Iverson's left hand is in a splint and soft cast, and the
Philadelphia 76ers' postseason hopes suddenly are looking grim.</TE>
<TE>   The league's most valuable player is through for the rest of the
regular season. Doctors said he is out for four to six weeks, and
Coach Larry Brown thinks fans shouldn't expect him back sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player. He's what this team is about.... We have to
get his hand healed," Brown said after practice Saturday. "I think if
it were up to him, he'd be back tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, who led the NBA in minutes, steals and scoring, with 31.5
points a game, was not available Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He broke a bone in his nonshooting hand during Friday night's
victory over Boston. He was to have the splint replaced with a hard
cast this weekend.</TE>

<HD>Slutskaya Edges Kwan for First World Title</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One month after failing to win the Olympic gold medal, Michelle Kwan
is no longer even the world champion.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan lost the world title she held for the last two years,
finishing second to Russia's Irina Slutskaya on Saturday in the World
Figure Skating Championships at Nagano, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   "After the Olympics a lot of people decided not to come," Kwan
said. "For me it is like, if you don't show up, you don't gain
anything, but also don't lose anything. I gained a lot by coming
here."</LD>
<TE>   Not as much as Slutskaya, who beat Kwan for the fifth time this
season to win her first world championship. Slutskaya had finished
second to Kwan three times, including the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple times I was so close and now I am just so happy as I
feel the medal," Slutskaya said. "It's sport and competing. Sometimes
someone else wins. We are just competing. Maybe I am just lucky
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Fumie Suguri of Japan finished third and Sasha Cohen of Laguna
Niguel was fourth.</TE>

<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams saved her best for last: a delicate drop shot on
match point that floated over the net, kissed the court and bounced
back toward her, beyond the reach of pesky Eva Dyrberg.</TE>
<TE>   That gave Williams a ragged 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory in the
Nasdaq-100 Open at Key Biscayne, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Also advancing in her opening match was No. 1-seeded Jennifer
Capriati, the current leader in her back-and-forth battle with
Williams atop the WTA Tour rankings. She beat Eleni Daniilidou, 6-0,
6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-seeded Monica Seles staged a comeback to defeat Conchita
Martinez for the 20th time in 21 matches, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   On the men's side, Goran Ivanisevic withdrew during his opening
match against Franco Squillari because of his chronic left shoulder
injury. He said he plans to rest and hopes to be ready to defend his
Wimbledon title in June.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras served 18 aces to beat Jarkko Nieminen, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, in the second round.</TE>

<TE>   Rick Mirer, who spent most of the last two seasons with the San
Francisco 49ers as Jeff Garcia's backup, signed with the Oakland
Raiders. Mirer, 32, will be playing for his sixth team in nine
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Deshea Townsend, unable to find a starting job with another team,
agreed to a $4.2-million, four-year contract to return as the
Pittsburgh Steelers' third cornerback. The contract includes a
signing bonus of about $1 million and counts about $800,000 against
the Steelers' 2002 salary cap.</TE>

<TE>   Former U.S. Olympic soccer coach Clive Charles is undergoing
treatment for prostate cancer. Charles, who coached the American men

remain in charge of the program but that assistants Bill Irwin and
Garrett Smith will assume day-to-day duties.</TE>
<TE>   Agoura High graduate Deena Drossin pushed Paula Radcliffe but
eventually lost to the defending champion, finishing in second place

<HD>Study: NFL Franchise Would Succeed in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Pro football: League's confidential survey shows there is
fan interest in a team, given the right conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An NFL franchise would succeed in Los Angeles, but it would require a
near-perfect combination of facility quality, ownership commitment
and promotion to do so, according to a confidential document obtained
by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by an independent research firm when L.A. was
being considered for an expansion franchise in 1999, was commissioned
by the league and distributed to selected team owners. Among the
findings:</LD>
<LD>   L.A. could be the best premium-seat market in the country--prime
spots could command Permanent Seat License fees in the neighborhood
of $6,000--but the city might be the nation's worst market in which
to sell season tickets.</LD>
<TE>   More than one-third of the respondents from Orange County
preferred a stadium in L.A., while only 11% of the L.A. respondents
preferred an Orange County site.</TE>
<TE>   The optimal stadium capacity is 66,000--expandable to 70,000 for a
Super Bowl--which is as small as possible to stoke ticket demand and
help avoid TV blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   At their annual meetings last week, several NFL owners said they
sensed apathy from L.A. and wondered whether interest was high enough
to support an NFL team. The subject of the NFL returning to L.A. has
gathered steam in recent weeks, in part because of a Philip
Anschutz-led effort to explore the possibility of building a football
stadium in downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every reason to think that when we get a team there and
the fans have their own home team to root for, that the interest will
be there," NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. "When you're talking
about an interest that's been in a sport for the better part of a
century, and a tradition post-World War II of supporting the
NFL--whether it be one team or two--I guess the question really is:
Is there any evidence to think somehow it's gone underground like a
groundhog? We don't think that's the case."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the league paid for the survey, which involved nearly 700
interviews from the L.A.-Orange County market and examined such
issues as TV ratings, demographics and buying power. It was conducted
by Muhleman Marketing Inc. and dated Feb. 25, 1999. A similar report
was prepared for Houston, which outbid L.A. for the league's 32nd
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape has changed in the three years since the report was
issued. For instance, the vast majority of those surveyed preferred
an expansion franchise over an existing team that relocated to L.A.
But that option is no longer available; the league has no plans to
expand in the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   By far the most likely team to relocate to L.A.--provided it has a
suitable stadium--is the San Diego Chargers. Already, the Chargers
are negotiating with Anschutz to move their training camp from La
Jolla to his $120-million sports complex in Carson, beginning in
summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   It's illogical to think Anschutz would construct a football
stadium without rock-solid assurances beforehand that a team was
lined up to play in it as soon as it was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Said one NFL owner: "Anschutz isn't going to build it on spec."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, league officials insist, their belief that L.A. is
fertile ground for an NFL team is not based entirely on blind faith
and solid TV ratings. They consider the 1999 study as part of their
due diligence. Then again, the study was paid for by the league.</TE>
<TE>   "[Muhleman] is a reputable firm, but you look at who's paying for
the study and the results are not that surprising," said David Carter
of the Sports Business Group, an L.A.-based consulting firm. "You can
make a compelling case either way, depending on what angle you're
coming from."</TE>
<TE>   Although the report focused primarily on the Coliseum and Carson
proposals, respondents were asked if there was a location--regardless
of any proposed sites--where they would like to see a new stadium
located. The Coliseum led that poll (23%), followed by Carson (15%),
Anaheim (10%), Dodger Stadium (8%), Orange County (8%), downtown
(6%), El Toro (5%) and Irvine (3%). Twenty-two percent of the
responses were classified as "other."</TE>
<TE>   The report characterizes L.A. as a market in which "fascination
comes before passion," and therefore said it would be critically
important to have a team featuring star players, and a unique
in-stadium experience.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone builds a stadium in L.A., it's got to be the place to
see and be seen," Carter said. "It's the old Forum Club magnified a
hundred-fold."</TE>
<TE>   The report also points to an exceptional opportunity with the
Latino community, which "appears to like NFL football almost as much
as Major League Baseball."</TE>
<TE>   According to Joe Browne, one of the league's senior vice
presidents, the most popular English-speaking program in Hispanic
households is "Monday Night Football." NFL Europe is investigating a
marketing relationship with F.C. Barcelona, among the world's most
popular soccer clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding that even with the changing demographics, there's a
lot of interest in our sport," Tagliabue said. "We're just going to
have to do things right, beginning with the stadium.... Every
indication we have in Los Angeles is the interest in the game is
there at all levels."</TE>
<TE>   Even armed with the information from its 1999 study, Carter said,
the league probably will be very careful and deliberate in its
approach to L.A. this time.</TE>
<TE>   "The NFL knows it can't afford a third strike in this area," he
said. "They've got to get the right ownership group, the right team,
and the right stadium. They can't fail a third time."</TE>

<HD>Shanahan Milestone Powers Red Wings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the previous eight games, Brendan Shanahan had seven assists.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, he got the elusive goal.</LD>
<LD>   Shanahan scored his 500th career goal, breaking a scoreless tie at
7:48 of the third period, and the Detroit Red Wings beat the Colorado
Avalanche, 2-0, Saturday at Denver to clinch the top spot in the
Western Conference.</LD>
<TE>   Dominik Hasek had 31 saves in earning his 61st career shutout,
best among active goalies.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan's power-play goal came on a two-man advantage after
Colorado's Alex Tanguay and Adam Foote had gone off on
holding-the-stick and slashing penalties, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan took Nicklas Lidstrom's pass and beat Patrick Roy from
the left circle.</TE>
<TE>   "My first NHL goal was pretty exciting, and it's nice to get the
500th," Shanahan said. "In my six years here, I don't know how many
goals Nick has given me like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad it wasn't a cheap goal. Patrick Roy is one of the best
goaltenders to ever play, and I have a lot of respect for him."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's leading scorer this season, Shanahan recorded his 34th
goal of the season. The 500-goal milestone already has been reached
by 29 other players, including Detroit teammates Brett Hull, Steve
Yzerman and Luc Robitaille.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, which dropped its third consecutive game, has scored
only eight goals in its last six games, during which it has been shut
out three times.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're not scoring goals," Colorado captain Joe Sakic
said. "We need to turn things around if we want to make a run at it
[Stanley Cup], because we aren't going too far if we keep this up."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the NHL's top rivalries pitting the league's two best
records, a fight erupted two minutes after Shanahan's goal.</TE>
<TE>   Roy exchanged punches with Detroit's Kirk Maltby after Maltby had
fallen into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek came down the ice and appeared to slip, upending Roy from
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Sean Avery and Colorado's Pascal Trepanier also traded
blows.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a Colorado power play, but the Avalanche couldn't
capitalize.</TE>
<TE>   Five penalties resulted from the fight, including two minutes to
Roy for roughing and two minutes to Hasek for leaving the crease.</TE>
<TE>   Roy was upset with Maltby, saying, "What I didn't like is he tried
to take my knee out. It was clear to me. Normally a guy will hit me
in front.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was not an accident. I thought he really meant to
hurt me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 5, Columbus 2--Ulf Dahlen scored his second goal and
Jaromir Jagr had another 18 seconds later in the third period as the
Capitals won at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus had come back from a two-goal deficit to tie it on Jody
Shelley's goal 7:29 into the third period, but the Capitals
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 5, Montreal 1--Jukka Hentunen made the most of his debut
for the Predators at Nashville with a goal and an assist in a victory
over the Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   Hentunen, traded to the Predators last week, had been on injured
reserve for the Calgary Flames after undergoing knee surgery in
January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Buffalo 0--Corey Schwab made 20 saves for his first
shutout of the season and Tie Domi scored as the Maple Leafs won at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab is 5-2-4 since replacing injured starting goalie Curtis
Joseph. Schwab didn't have to make any spectacular saves, but was
steady throughout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Ottawa 2--Dany Heatley scored at 1:41 of overtime at
Ottawa and Frederic Cassivi made 50 saves in only his second NHL
start as the Thrashers defeated the Senators.</TE>
<TE>   Heatley, who also had an assist, stuffed a rebound past Senator
goaltender Martin Prusek, who was making his NHL regular-season
debut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, New Jersey 2--Defenseman Sean Hill scored with 4:15
left and the Hurricanes having two extra players as they won at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff O'Neill had an empty-net goal and Arturs Irbe stopped all 12
New Jersey shots in the third period as Carolina handed the Devils
only their sixth loss in 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Florida 1--Mike Knuble scored the go-ahead goal midway
through the third period and Glen Murray scored one into an empty-net
for the Bruins at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Pittsburgh 4--Alexei Kovalev scored twice in the
third period at Pittsburgh as the Penguins, trying to keep alive
their flickering playoff hopes, rallied for the tie. Pittsburgh is
eight points out of a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 2, Minnesota 1--Mark Parrish scored his 28th
goal of the season with 4:07 left at Uniondale, N.Y., to help the
Islanders take sole possession of sixth place in the Eastern
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Calgary 1--Mike York, Mike Grier and Eric Brewer
scored first-period goals at Edmonton, Canada for the Oilers, who
also got 34 saves from Tommy Salo.</TE>

<LD>It's a lesson all parents try to instill in their children: Work hard
and good things will happen.</LD>
<LD>   Two baseball players from the San Fernando Valley, junior pitcher
Justin Cassel of Chatsworth High and senior left fielder Adam McLeod
of Reseda Cleveland, have begun to fulfill their potential because
they've gone beyond the normal commitment to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, Cassel struggled at times. He had a 4.40 earned-run
average. He walked 43 batters in 592/3 innings. He had no one to
blame but himself because he was out of shape.</LD>
<TE>   This season, he wakes up at 5 a.m. and works out at a fitness
center before going to school. He has lost 20 pounds, dropping to
195.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made a huge difference," Cassel said. "I feel I can compete
one through seven innings. With your body in shape, your mechanics
are so fluid."</TE>
<TE>   He has allowed one earned run in 27 innings, walked only five and
is 4-0 for the No. 1-ranked team in Southern California. He has been
pitching even better than teammate Joe Guntz, who has a 28-0 career
record.</TE>
<TE>   Much was expected of Cassel. His brother, Matt, is a quarterback
at USC. Another brother, Jack, is a pitcher in the San Diego Padre
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Cassel has finally become a consistent pitcher because of hard
work.</TE>
<TE>   McLeod needed a push from his mother, Donna, to figure out what he
really wanted to accomplish in sports. He quit baseball when he was
8. He started playing again as a freshman in high school, at the
urging of his mother, who didn't want him sitting around the house
watching television.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a job or play baseball," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   For almost three years on junior varsity, McLeod, 6 feet and 185
pounds, worked on regaining his form.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the guys here have been playing since 5," he said. "I
picked it up again at 14. It's a constant learning process."</TE>
<TE>   In his first full season on varsity, McLeod is batting .423. He's
one of the fastest players in the West Valley League. He has the kind
of natural skills scouts look for. But more importantly, he has been
willing to start from the bottom and work his way to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still not there yet," he said. "It's a lot of hard work. I'm
feeling a lot more comfortable. I envision myself as an athlete still
learning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior left-hander Mike McKernan of Westminster La Quinta deserves
respect. He is overshadowed because he plays on the same team with
junior right-hander Ian Kennedy, who throws fastballs in the 92-mph
range.</TE>
<TE>   But McKernan has a 5-0 record and an earned-run average of 0.72.
In three seasons, his varsity record is 21-2. He struck out 16
Wednesday in a 2-0 victory over Fountain Valley Los Amigos.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westlake High Coach Chuck Berrington is beaming these days not
only because his team is off to an 8-2 start, but also because four
of his former shortstops are starting at the collegiate level--Kevin
Howard at Miami, Scott Dragicevich at Stanford, Jeff Dragicevich at
California and Ryan McCarthy at UCLA. And he has a promising
sophomore shortstop in Kyle Brockett.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Loyola High football players are participating in 6
a.m. weight-training sessions, and college coaches might want to take
a look at 6-foot-6, 235-pound defensive end Mike Horgan. He's a
former hockey player who started playing football only two years ago.
He broke his leg last season, forcing him to miss four games, but he
projects as a senior standout.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Randy Estes, one of the top sophomore football
players at Long Beach Poly, has transferred to Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Fauria brothers are on the move. Lance Fauria, football coach
at Santa Maria St. Joseph for three years, has resigned to become a
high school coach in Kerrville, Texas. Younger brother Christian, a
tight end at Encino Crespi High who played seven years with the
Seattle Seahawks, has signed with the New England Patriots.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Cael Sanderson went out perfect.</LD>
<LD>   The Iowa State senior completed his record-setting college career
Saturday, winning his 159th match without a loss and claiming his
fourth consecutive NCAA wrestling title.</LD>
<LD>   The 197-pound Sanderson caught Jon Trenge by the ankle, turned it
into a double-leg takedown and put the Lehigh sophomore on his back
for a near fall, going on to score a 12-4 major decision.</LD>
<TE>   More than 12,000 fans at the Pepsi Arena gave Sanderson a standing
ovation that lasted nearly five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I was fighting basically, the fear that I would not
perform up to my capability," Sanderson said, adding that it had been
an effort to prepare for all those matches over four years. He was
named the tournament's outstanding wrestler.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State's Pat Smith, who had five losses in his career, is
the only other four-time NCAA champion.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Iowa State wrestlers were champions, lifting the
Cyclones to second place in team standings with 104 points.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota won with 126.5 points after two of its wrestlers won
titles. Oklahoma, Iowa and Oklahoma State followed.</TE>
<TE>   At 141 pounds, Iowa State's Aaron Holker won a 10-5 decision over
Eric Larkin of Arizona State. Cyclone senior Joe Heskett scored a
late takedown to defeat Matt Lackey of Illinois at 165 pounds to win
for the first time in three trips to the finals.</TE>

<TE>   Walk the beach, for another.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I'm from, everybody always watching you, everybody always
talking behind your back, you can't do nothing," said the celebrated
Slovakian winger. "Here, it's good."</TE>
<TE>   Good and quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy could be the star of this team on the basis of his name
alone--The Ziggy Follies! ZigAlert!--but he notes that his family
back home doesn't even call him Ziggy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Zigo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy could be a star here the way Luc Robitaille and Rob Blake
were once stars, but he deflects more than pucks.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to talk to him?" he asked reporters Saturday,
pointing to Jason Allison.</TE>
<TE>   As the Kings slide into what could be their best spring in nearly
a decade, Palffy could be their face, their voice, their smile.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he's their enigma.</TE>
<TE>   What they see off the ice has sometimes been what they get during
games.</TE>
<TE>   Too many shadows. Too much silence. Too soft. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   "Ziggy can be like a Joe Sakic for our team," said Ian Laperriere,
referring to last year's league MVP. "If he competes, he's got all
the skills, and that's what he's been showing the last couple of
months."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he ever intends to show anything.</TE>
<TE>   "In hockey, we have helmets," Palffy said with a relieved smile.
"Nobody sees you under the helmets."</TE>
<TE>   He is so into this "Hollow Man" thing, earlier this year he tried
to sneak into a game in the Winter Olympics, playing for his native
Slovakia against Germany even though King officials asked him to skip
that game.</TE>
<TE>   He had just played for the Kings the night before. They wanted him
to rest a day before playing. But Slovakia was losing to Germany, so
midway through the second period, he took the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they didn't notice," he said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the Kings noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "A reporter called me and told me about it," said Coach Andy
Murray with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Geez, no wonder the guy doesn't like talking to us.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings forbade him to play the next day against Latvia before
returning to the team. He followed orders. Slovakia lost and was
eliminated from the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, when asked whether he understood the Kings' position,
Palffy frowned and said, "I didn't say that."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "The Kings have to be my priority. I know that
now."</TE>
<TE>   That has been about his only mistake since returning from the
lineup from a rib injury in January. Since that time, the Kings have
won 22 of 32 games, and Palffy has been their best, if not most
obscure, player.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a rare bird," said teammate Jaroslav Modry.</TE>
<TE>   How about those two Saturday sightings?</TE>
<TE>   In the first period, he chipped a shot off the pads of Shark
goalie Evgeni Nabokov, corralled the rebound, and knocked a second
shot over the guy.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, standing on the same right side of the goal,
he stopped a rebound of a Modry shot and stuck it past Nabokov again.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, he succeeded by working without the puck, under the
radar, away from the glare.</TE>
<TE>   "When he wants to play--when he wants to step up and become a good
team player--it's scary," Modry said.</TE>
<TE>   And when he doesn't, well, witness last spring's second round of
the playoffs against the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Seven games, two points, too hollow.</TE>
<TE>   He was subtly criticized by Murray throughout the series, and
heard every word.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy is always getting on me," he said. "Sometimes it's good,
sometimes it's bad."</TE>
<TE>   Then, by the middle of this season, his linemates from that
playoff series--Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel--had been essentially
sent packing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard for them, hard for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But now, finally, he seems to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after arriving here from the New York Islanders--where
he became a high-scoring star for a team that never made the
playoffs--his job has changed.</TE>
<TE>   He can score here, but he also needs to help others score. He
needs to pass. He needs to defend.</TE>
<TE>   Said Palffy: "I've grown enough to understand it's about the team
now. It's about helping everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "Every year, he's made improvements in that area."</TE>
<TE>   And now that the Kings are playing well enough to steal a second
seeding in the playoffs, well enough to advance past the second round
for only the second time in team history?</TE>
<TE>   That would indeed put Palffy in a position to be recognized as one
of the league's best players. Maybe even its most valuable.</TE>
<TE>   But you didn't read it here.</TE>

<HD>Foreword to March: Every Game Counts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Oregon and Kansas, the participants in today's NCAA Midwest Regional
final, are proof that the regular season matters.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon, Pacific 10 champion, and Kansas, Big 12 champion,
developed during the course of the season the kind of quiet
confidence, the good habits, the belief in their ability to do the
right thing at the right time that serves teams well as the opponents
get tougher and the mood more tense and the stakes so high.</LD>
<LD>   When Oregon guard James Davis missed the front end of a
one-and-one and the Ducks were leading Texas by only two points with
34 seconds to play, and when the Longhorns tied the score 10 seconds
later, Frederick Jones told the disconsolate Davis that it was OK,
that Jones would make sure the game wasn't lost and that Davis would
not be a goat.</LD>
<TE>   When two Kansas starters, Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich, were in
foul trouble five minutes into the Jayhawks' game against Illinois,
Coach Roy Williams looked confidently at his deep bench and felt as
if the game would still be in Kansas' control because the assorted
freshmen and sophomores had all played important minutes all season
and had learned something about failure, certainly, but learned much
more about success.</TE>
<TE>   One of those freshmen, Aaron Miles, says it was no big deal when
Hinrich, a guard like himself, went to the bench. "All us freshmen,
we knew we had to step it up. But it's something we knew we were
capable of doing because we'd done it."</TE>
<TE>   Illinois' leading scorer, Frank Williams, had been strongly
criticized for a perception that he would not play hard or seriously
all the time. The criticism was especially strong after Williams was
scoreless in the first half of Illinois' second-round game last
weekend against Creighton and then scored 20 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "People can say what they want," Williams had said, "but I know
when it's time to play."</TE>
<TE>   There is a certain arrogance to that attitude, a certain sense of
entitlement, as if even great talent can be put into hibernation or
left unnurtured until you feel like using it. And sports doesn't work
that way.</TE>
<TE>   When Williams needed to make an open, relatively routine jump shot
with six seconds left and his team losing by two against Kansas on
Friday night, Williams couldn't make the shot.</TE>
<TE>   When Oregon's Jones drove to the basket in a tie game with less
than three seconds left, when Jones moved as close as possible to the
basket, when he knew just how hard to push on the defender to give
himself an advantage but not a foul, Jones was relying on memory, on
how he had hit the same kind of shot against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've done it," Jones says, "it makes it easier to do it
again."</TE>
<TE>   In the first five minutes of a Kansas news conference Saturday,
the word "confident" was used five times. It wasn't said as a cocky
brag. It was said because the Jayhawks, coaches and players, feel
certain they are doing the right things with this team. They feel
certain because those things brought Kansas undefeated through the
Big 12 regular season. Those things, the ability to keep forcing
tempo, to keep out of sluggish half-court games in which their depth
and their talent at stopping and shooting on a dime are negated,
served the Jayhawks well when Illinois kept pushing at them.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we'd withstood the same kind of things Illinois
threw at us," Hinrich says. "When you've been committed to doing the
right things all season, you kind of remember how to do those things
in the postseason too."</TE>
<TE>   The teams that seemed to take pride in their ability to put aside
mediocrity and rise to the occasion of the tournament are gone. UCLA,
Missouri, Illinois, those teams had all bragged a little that it was
OK to have been disappointing underachievers in January and February
because they had all won a couple of games in March. But when it
counted most, on the biggest weekend before the Final Four, the bad
habits of January and February took priority over the assumption that
March would make everything all right.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Coach Ernie Kent was pressed Saturday about whether his
Ducks, who like to push the ball and force the tempo, who like to
shoot early and often, would be better served slowing things down
because, after all, Kansas does the same thing and has done it
longer, with more people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at our best when we can get out and run in transition,"
Kent says. "Why would we think it would be different on this one day?
We know who we are. We are who we are because that's who we want to
be. I'm sure it's the same for Kansas. We've gotten to this point,
both of us, by learning who we are and becoming who we should
become."</TE>
<TE>   Luke Ridnour, Oregon's point guard, suggested that today's game
would be fun to watch.</TE>
<TE>   He's right. It is fun to watch two basketball teams who have taken
every game that has come before, even the losses, as a chance to
improve, to create an identity, to become something consistent,
something reliable, something to be proud of.</TE>

<HD>It's Arc of Triumph for Indiana</HD>
<DH>South: Hoosiers hit 15 of 19 three-pointers to defeat Kent
State and give Davis his first Final Four berth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, KY.</DL>
<LD>LEXINGTON, Ky.--The simple uniforms and the short-haired shooters of
Indiana are back in the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since 1953, a coach other than Bob Knight is
taking them there.</LD>
<LD>   A hail of Hoosier three-point baskets beat Kent State, 81-69, in
the NCAA South Regional final Saturday in front of a roaring crowd of
22,435 at Rupp Arena, most of them in red.</LD>
<TE>   After the last of the 15 three-pointers Indiana made in 19
attempts had splashed through the net, Coach Mike Davis pointed to
the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Then he strode through press row to hand the game ball to Myles
Brand, the Indiana University president who was hung in effigy after
firing Knight and naming Davis interim coach two seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's victory should be remembered for the toughness and grit
and incredible shooting of the Hoosier players, who made their first
eight shots from long range without a miss. But, as usual, Knight
looms almost as large as the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw President Brand during the celebration," said guard Kyle
Hornsby, who made four of five three-pointers and scored 16 points.
"I can remember back when we weren't--I'm going to go ahead and say
this--we weren't all that fond of him at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "But I looked at him and shook his hand and even gave him a hug
and said, 'We've come a long way. I remember what it was like back
then. We've come a long way.' He grinned, and smiled and said, 'Yeah,
we have.'"</TE>
<TE>   Knight took Indiana to five Final Fours--the first in 1973, the
most recent in 1992--and won three NCAA titles in 29 seasons. But it
has been Davis' team since Knight was fired for violation of a
so-called "zero-tolerance policy" after what turned out to be his
final, controversial run-in, with a student.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had a rough go with an Indiana following still loyal to
Knight--now the coach at Texas Tech, which lost to Southern Illinois
in the first round--but Brand might have seen that turmoil fade as
the clock ticked down Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fans have come to know Mike and come to understand
Mike Davis and this team," Brand said. "This is the future of Indiana
basketball, right here."</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, Indiana upset top-seeded and defending national
champion Duke by coming from 17 points down to win behind the inside
play of 6-foot-10 sophomore Jared Jeffries.</TE>
<TE>   Against a Kent State team that opened in a zone defense and tried
to collapse on Jeffries, Indiana (24-11) turned its three-point
shooters loose and they responded with a mind-boggling display of 79%
accuracy after shooting 39% during the season.</TE>
<TE>   The 15 three-pointers set Indiana's school record in tournament
games, but the percentage was short of the record of 89% set twice on
eight-of-nine shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Fife made the first two three-pointers for Indiana, and the
Hoosiers were off. Hornsby made the third, center Jarrad Odle made
the fourth and then Hornsby made another. By then, the lead was 15-4,
and it would grow as large as 20 points before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana didn't miss a three until A.J. Moye misfired with a little
more than six minutes left in the first half--and by halftime the
Hoosiers had made nine of 11.</TE>
<TE>   They shot 64% overall, and their 78.9% from three-point range was
the fifth-highest by any team in an NCAA tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   For Kent State (30-6), a 21-game winning streak came to an end.
Every time Kent State fought back, getting as close as seven points
with 61/2 minutes to play, Indiana made another three and then locked
down on defense. The Hoosiers made forward Antonio Gates work for
every one of his 22 points and took guard Trevor Huffman out of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Coach Knight was watching, because he probably saw a lot
of his teaching in the way we played," said Fife, who made five of
six three-point tries, scored 17 points and had a shouting match with
Davis worthy of a Knight confrontation after being pulled.</TE>
<TE>   "As usual, if a foul is called on me, it wasn't a foul," Fife
said. "I think Coach didn't believe it when I said I didn't foul him.
Neither did anyone else in the stadium, 22,000 of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our cute little argument.... Then he put me back in. We
had a little hug after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] you can't mention us, as far as I'm concerned, and how hard
this team plays without mentioning Coach Knight. Coach Davis is the
main catalyst in this whole ordeal, but Coach Knight is a reason a
lot of us came here.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I watched his first game. But we've got our own team.
For whatever reason, he's not our coach. We've got a new coach, and a
new system. Our team did a great job of making that transition, but I
will always root for him."</TE>
<TE>   There was a new Hoosier hero at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Tom Coverdale made three of four three-point attempts and
scored 14 points before leaving with a sprained ankle in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   His defense on Huffman--held to a mere eight points and seven
shots--helped Coverdale earn honors as most outstanding player
despite not finishing the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Indiana players made sure he snipped a strand of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom, he's hurting every week. Something's the matter with his
back, his eyelid, his ankle," Jeffries said. ... "It was important to
get him up there. Emotionally, he leads us, and he's just a really
big part of this team."</TE>
<TE>   They all were. So, in an odd way, is Brand, who had the team over
to his home for dinner about six weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so thankful to President Brand," Davis said. "What you have
to understand is it took great courage for him to name me interim
coach at Indiana, because this is a big-time program.... I could
never show him how much I appreciate the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Consider it an opportunity they all grabbed.</TE>
<TE>   "This means a lot, because we've created something new," Jeffries
said. "There was a lot of tradition that was kind of taken away--not
taken away, but kind of exiled, when Coach Knight was fired. Now with
this team, Coach Davis has created something new."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Nets Multiyear Accord</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Staples Center will stage season-ending WTA
championships in early November for at least three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For at least three years, possibly four, the season-ending WTA
championships will be held at Staples Center, and then could
potentially move to Europe, said Kevin Wulff, the WTA's chief
executive.</LD>
<LD>   Wulff said Saturday that the WTA has a seven-year agreement with
rights holder Octagon and Anschutz Entertainment Group. The
$3-million women's tennis event starts the week of Nov. 4, flipping
spots with the Fed Cup final, which will now be the week of Oct. 28.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to develop the event in L.A., to develop sponsorship
support," he said from Miami. "We also have an agreement we would
move the event to Europe. It would be great if we could move to an
AEG venue, but we would also look outside an AEG venue."</LD>
<TE>   This possibility helped garner support from European tournament
directors. After the U.S. Open, a big part of the women's tour is
indoors at venues throughout Europe. The WTA's board of directors
voted Friday to move the championships from Munich, Germany, to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Octagon President Phil de Picciotto said the move after three or
four years in Los Angeles was not a foregone conclusion, saying it
was "likely, but not certain." Some of the details and contract
language was still being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Wulff also said that the WTA has started talks with the ATP about
eventually combining their season-ending championships. The men's
tour had its finale in Sydney, Australia, last year and it is in
Shanghai in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had very preliminary discussions," Wulff said. "If it's
good for tennis, I think we should continue the discussions. I think
we need to understand some of the financial ramifications of a
combined championships and some of those challenges."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, however, attention turns to the women's
championships, which will be played in Southern California for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to play a more active role, and all of us are working
together to build this into the crown jewel that it should be," Wulff
said. "There's been some good things in the past. We can ratchet it
up several levels."</TE>
<TE>   The board vote was a positive referendum on Wulff's vision. The
new chief executive, who started in January, said players were
equally enthusiastic, giving him and Josh Ripple, the chief operating
officer, high-fives in the lounge at the tournament in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a phone call from Martina [Hingis] a few minutes ago, she
picked it up on the Web site and the Internet and just was excited,
bubbly, and called to congratulate us, unsolicited," Wulff said.</TE>
<TE>   Wulff confirmed that Los Angeles is a candidate for the relocation
of WTA headquarters, and a decision should come within 30 to 45 days.
He said there are two to three cities in contention. Another is
believed to be Atlanta.</TE>

<HD>Tailback Battle Is On at USC</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's football opener against Auburn is five months away, but the
competition at tailback between Sultan McCullough and Justin Fargas
got a jump-start Saturday with the beginning of spring practice.</LD>
<LD>   "It's already on," Coach Pete Carroll said. "Everything they do
counts."</LD>
<LD>   Fargas, who sat out last season as a transfer from Michigan, said
he felt butterflies before stepping onto the practice field "almost
like I was about to play a game." McCullough, meanwhile, appeared
recovered from abdominal surgery several months ago.</LD>
<TE>   The competition should be equally fierce at cornerback, where
converted receiver Marcell Allmond got his first try after returning
to the team from a student conduct suspension.</TE>
<TE>   His workout was cut short, however, when he rushed across the
street to compete for USC in a track meet.</TE>
<TE>   A number of incoming recruits attended the session, including
Banning High defensive tackle Fred Matua, who studied the offensive
line.</TE>
<TE>   He said coaches have asked him to switch positions and bring his
fiery demeanor to a unit that has struggled in recent seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans will conduct 15 practices over the next month, with
the annual "Trojan Huddle" scrimmage scheduled for 11 a.m. on April 6
at the Coliseum.</TE>

<HD>Everything's OK With Sooners Now</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Playing in the Big 12 Conference with high-profile Kansas,
sentimental favorite Oklahoma State and Bob Knight's Texas Tech,
Oklahoma enjoyed flying under the national radar much of the season.</LD>
<LD>   But after beating the Jayhawks to win the conference tournament,
the third-ranked Sooners felt disrespected when they were seeded
second in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, the Sooners were feeling good about themselves again
after rushing into the nation's consciousness and into the Final
Four, beating conference rival Missouri, 81-75, in a foul-filled West
Regional final at Compaq Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We were overlooked again and we had a mind-set of showing that we
deserved a No. 1 seed," said Sooner junior guard Hollis Price, the
regional's most outstanding player. "But it's OK now. We're going to
the Final Four."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma (31-4) will meet South Regional champion Indiana (24-11)
Saturday in the national semifinals at Atlanta in the Sooners' first
trip to the Final Four in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got Georgia on my mind," Sooner Coach Kelvin Sampson said.
"I've got Saturday and Monday [the title game] on my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Having four players score in double figures was also in Sampson's
thoughts after the Sooners had defeated the Tigers for the ninth
consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Price led Oklahoma with 18 points, including four three-point
baskets, and junior small forward Ebi Ere added 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Senior power forward Aaron McGhee, who was limited to 20 minutes
because of foul trouble, had 15 points, including a clutch
three-point basket late in the game that extended Oklahoma's
then-dwindling lead to six points.</TE>
<TE>   Junior point guard Quannas White, meanwhile, played the most
complete game of his Sooner career, finishing with 12 points, seven
rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one turnover in 35 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it wasn't as if the No. 12-seeded Tigers (24-12) were
easily handled. Missouri, the lowest-seeded team ever to reach a
regional final, had plenty of chances to upend the Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   But the Tigers missed 14 of 34 free throws and high-scoring senior
point guard Clarence Gilbert, who entered the game averaging 19.7
points while shooting 44.7% from the field in three NCAA tournament
wins, made only one of 16 shots against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to keep a hand in his face," said White, who drew
defensive duty on Gilbert, "and not let him get a good look at the
basket."</TE>
<TE>   Mission accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a bad shooting night," said Gilbert, who had seven
points. "In the second half I felt I was going to get it going, get
rolling and we'd go ahead and win the game. It never happened, but we
still had an opportunity to win the game. We just didn't get it
done."</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Coach Quin Snyder felt for his senior.</TE>
<TE>   "It was painful to watch that happen to Clarence because you know
what he's capable of doing," Snyder said. "I kept thinking the next
one was going to go in. Somehow, it's supposed to work like that.
He's supposed to hit a big shot and bring us back. But it didn't
happen that way today."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was Tiger sophomore Rickey Paulding who kept Missouri
afloat. The shooting guard had a game-high 22 points and junior small
forward Kareem Rush, who is undecided about opting for the NBA draft,
may have closed out his college career with 17 points before fouling
out in 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The whistles were blowing all game for both teams, with a combined
54 fouls called.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the Big 12 Conference, though," said McGhee, who went to
the bench with his fourth foul less than two minutes into the second
half with Oklahoma leading by 10 points, 45-35.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough conference and the referees were calling everything.
We're a physical-style team and Missouri is too. But the tougher team
won."</TE>
<TE>   By the time McGhee returned, Missouri had crept back to within
three, 70-67, on a Rush three-pointer with 2:41 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven seconds later, the 6-foot-8, 250-pound left-handed
McGhee responded by making a three-pointer from the right wing.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri would not get within six points again.</TE>
<TE>   "Oklahoma's a great team," Snyder said. "There's no shame in what
we did today."</TE>
<TE>   In running their winning streak to 12 games, the Sooners advanced
to the Final Four for the first time since losing the 1988 title game
to Kansas and Danny Manning.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I wasn't even playing basketball in 1988," said Ere, who was
born seven years earlier. "I watched cartoons in 1988--Batman and
Robin, Thundercats, He-Man and She-Ra."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson had just finished coaching his first season at Washington
State in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I was proud to be a No. 2 seed, but I was disappointed in not
being a [No. 1] only because I thought we earned it," he said. "I
don't think you should ask for anything unless you've earned it. I
thought we had earned a [No. 1] seed, but I also understood the
committee's problem--I thought five teams earned it."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners, though, were the first to get to Atlanta.</TE>

<LD>At 6 feet 2, Randie Wirt rarely defends on the perimeter. One thing
she has done for a long time, though, is shoot free throws in the
driveway with her father. She was great on both counts, and it paid
off for Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Wirt made two free throws with eight seconds remaining and Tera
Bjorkland scored 10 of her 17 points in the second half as
third-seeded Colorado beat No. 2 Stanford, 62-59, Saturday night in a
West Regional semifinal at Boise, Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just another two free throws," said Wirt, who practiced
them with her father, Robert, as a youth in New Prague, Minn. "That's
what everybody does with their dad growing up. Pretend it's an NCAA
regional and shoot."</LD>
<TE>   Colorado (24-9) will play Big 12 rival Oklahoma next.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being cool at the line, Wirt drew the assignment against
6-2 Nicole Powell, who posted triple-doubles in Stanford's first two
tournament games. This time, she had 13 points, eight rebounds and
six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (32-3) had a chance to force overtime with 4.2 seconds
left. The ball went to Powell on the left wing but she passed to
Lindsey Yamasaki at the top of the key. Her three-point attempt at
the buzzer missed.</TE>

<TE>   Oklahoma 72, Texas Tech 62--Forward Caton Hill scored 15 points

(20-12) in the other semifinal at Boise.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners (30-3) also got 18 points from LaNeishea Caufield and
15 from Stacey Dales, their All-American swing guard.</TE>

<TE>   Vanderbilt 70, North Carolina 61--Chantelle Anderson had 22 points

of a 13-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Coretta Brown scored 19 for North Carolina (26-9).</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 68, Brigham Young 57--Freshman Shyra Ely scored the
first 12 points of a game-turning 15-0 run late in the first half and
finished with 21 as second-seeded Tennessee defeated 11th-seeded BYU
at Ames, Iowa. The Lady Vols improved to 28-4. Melanie Pearson led
BYU (24-9) with 23 points.</TE>

points from Lucienne Berthieu to win their 21st consecutive game and
earn a meeting in the final with top-seeded Connecticut. Kansas State
finished 26-8.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut 82, Penn State 64--The top-seeded Huskies struggled
before holding fourth-seeded Penn State to 13 points over the final
15 minutes to win at Milwaukee. Sue Bird scored 24 points for the

third-seeded South Carolina. Texas finished 22-10.</TE>

<LD>I love seeing Eric Pape's New York essays ("Letter From New York,"
Feb. 17). He's a terrific writer with great insight into regional
cultures and common threads of experience. You should continue to bring
his writing to the pages of The Times.</LD>

<TE>   Pape notes that as a result of Sept. 11, "the city has been reduced to
a village." He points out that many of the villagers don't feel as tough
as they used to. Some have become tentative or even reclusive. But I
think that Pape missed the most palpable effect of that horrific day:
People are coming forward more often now to help their fellow man.</TE>

<HD>Driven to Cell-Phone Frustration</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kudos to James Ricci for his article on the hazards of cell-phone
use while driving and to Assemblyman Joe Simitian for his much-needed
legislation ("A Call for Hands-Free Cell-Phone Use," Metropolis, Feb.
17). Study after study proves that drivers cannot be trusted to drive and
use cell phones at the same time. It never fails that when someone is
weaving in traffic, does not respond when a signal changes or, worst of
all, screams through a red light, the culprit is almost always chatting
away, unaware of what they've done. How important are these conversations
that they can't wait until the drivers get off the road?</LD>
<LD>   Ron Sloan</LD>
<LD>   Costa Mesa</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surely others have noticed the flaw in the arguments to enact a law
banning cell-phone use while driving. Ricci begins his column with the
argument that not having both hands on the wheel is the problem, but he
ends with the conclusion (based on a University of Utah study) that it
isn't holding the cell phone but the engrossing conversations that are
the most dangerous distractions.</TE>
<TE>   If we take his argument to its logical conclusion, we also will have
to legislate new laws to ban the following: eating or drinking beverages
while driving; pushing buttons while driving, including radios and CD
players; having conversations with passengers while driving. Oh, yes,
don't forget driving with children. They are the ultimate distraction. I
have learned that the best way to be safe is to drive defensively and use
common sense. I don't pick up my coffee cup or cell phone until
conditions permit. We don't need to waste time and money enacting more
driving laws.</TE>

<LD>I find it unconscionable that you devoted so much of your Spring
Fashion Issue (Feb. 24) to L.A. motorists who find it fashionable to tool
around in gas-guzzling monstrosities. This is not a trend that Angelenos
should extol. When I was 24, I drove a '73 Datsun 1200 that got 44 miles
per gallon. At the time, auto manufacturers focused primarily on fuel
economy--a "fashion trend" that garnered Los Angeles the best air quality
it had had in years. Now I sit in traffic in my '88 Honda Civic, shoulder
to shoulder with a growing sea of SUVs and oversized sedans, watching the
acrid pall of smoke over our city grow denser and wondering what happened
to greater fuel-economy vehicles.</LD>

<TE>   A few weeks ago I tossed my Prada bag into my car, removed the Miu Miu
heels from my feet, fired up my fully restored 1967 Camaro and thought to
myself, "What the hell is a 36-year-old woman doing in a car like this?"
The question plagued me for a few days, and I began to wonder if I was
having a midlife crisis. Despite having owned my car for years, I began
to examine why I was holding onto it. When your fashion issue arrived, I
realized that I am doing what a Los Angeles native needs to do. I am
being who I am: a mom who knows how to gap her own spark plugs, adjust
the carb, change the oil and diagnose any mechanical problem. Clearly,
L.A. is the only place for women like me. Thank you for reminding me of
that.</TE>

<LD>Artist Shelley Abraham was casting about for fresh ideas when her
actor husband was slipped an underground copy of "the breakdowns," the
industry's best-known listing of open film and TV roles. Posted for
subscribers on the Internet by  Los Angeles-based Breakdown Services, the
bulletin has totemic status among  actors thanks to its inside track on
studio projects; its inaccessibility (only qualified agents and managers
may subscribe); and, last but not least, the often bizarre character
descriptions Breakdown writers compose from a script or the directives of
studio casting personnel.</LD>
<LD>   Galvanized, Abraham, 35, turned out a dozen portraits based on the
sheet's most absurd character entries, including Heidi ("a sexy coroner
who cannot control her hunger for donuts and whose grasp of forensic
science is noticeably shaky"); "Maintenance Man Dan" ("a nerdy yet
attractive oddball who might just be evil"); "Tammi Look-Alike" ("this
older, heavier and 'sluttier' Tammi look-alike appears in Tammi's
fantasy, laughing maniacally as she blows away Dwight's Grandmother");
"Ron Solo" ("raised by religious fundamentalist parents, Ron trolls the
nightclubs looking for love in all the wrong places. Hates his life,
hates himself; glasses a plus"); and "Mr. Chili Dog" ("a male Caucasian,
he could be tall and lean to match the shape of a Chili Dog, but we are
open to all types, as long as he looks like a hot dog").</LD>
<TE>   Showings in Studio City, at an art festival and at the Soho Gallery,
have sold eight to 10 of the folk art-style acrylics on wood, garnering
admirers such as Breakdown Services president Gary Marsh,  whose
company's in-house "Board of Shame" highlights  the more preposterous
breakdowns. Marsh purchased Abraham's rendering of "Mario Orsini" ("an
overweight, blind Italian opera singer,"), which now resides in the
Breakdown writers' office.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham, a former set designer/painter for low-budget films ("some of
it was more like porn, actually") admits that her off-kilter sense of
humor has not always been well received. "When I was a fine-arts student
at Ohio State," she says, "my professors would admonish me for not being
angst-ridden enough." Abraham sees the paintings, which sell for about
$600 to $1,000, as an antidote to the absurdities of life in Hollywood.
"It helps reconcile my Midwestern self to Los Angeles and relieves the
stress of being an actor's wife. If you take it all too seriously, you'll
shoot yourself." Abraham's latest portrait? That would be "Peeka"
("transvestite, a tall, bulky, menacing man in drag. He is a wannabe
performance artist who goes into a vicious rage because someone has
stolen his Fruit Loops").</TE>
<TE>   Watching late-night TV some weeks back, Abraham spotted Mr. Chili Dog
on a commercial. "Unlike my [painting], he wasn't wearing a pimp's fur
coat. He was wrapped in a Styrofoam hot dog bun, running through some
grass. I  called my husband to [come] see, but by the time he got there,
Mr. Chili Dog had just exploded."</TE>

<LD>The highlight of "Hollywood Pitch Market: A Screenwriters
Conference" is a pitch-a-thon where writers get five minutes to present

It's the pinnacle of frustration that  any writer would know.</TE>

<LD>"I hesitate to use names," says Michael Bendetti, the man behind
Bendetti Mobile screening theaters. "But the biggest director I know in
the world used us and uses us." In fact, Bendetti says, many a big-name
director has used his poshly appointed trailers, which rent for about
$3,500 a week, to screen dailies on the set. Not only are they spacious,
at nearly 800 square feet, they're plush, featuring wall-to-wall
carpeting, oversized, upholstered tiered seats and extras such as
hands-free loudspeaker communication with the projection room.</LD>
<LD>   Who knew? Until Bendetti, 34, a former actor who appeared on "21 Jump
Street" from 1990 to 1991, introduced the trailers in 1997, most
directors schlepped to hotel rooms to screen dailies, he says. "Or they
erected four walls on the set. And I thought, isn't this horrible. These
are A-class guys and they're watching dailies in an inadequate place."</LD>
<TE>   More recently, Bendetti has taken the location trailer to another
level with a line of mobile "celebrity suites." "The theory on that," he
says, "is that it was odd to see these major movie stars walking out of a
trailer RV that any guy could buy and take on a camping trip. We decided
to build something beyond anything they had seen." Among other
enticements, the sleek, fully loaded luxury pads offer recessed lighting,
wood cabinets, Italian tile bathrooms and satellite TV in the lounge as
well as in the bedroom, and a full-service kitchen. "There's also an
office on board, with a fax and a desk, so they can have an assistant,"
says Bendetti.</TE>
<TE>   Transportable amenities seem to run in Bendetti's family. "My cousins
are the Zambonis," he says. "They invented the ice machine. It innovated
that industry, and I think we're doing that same thing."</TE>

<LD>When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to
make Oscar a superhero, Alex Ross came to the rescue. Armed with his
paintbrush and his imagination, the intrepid illustrator of graphic
novels (book-length comic epics) saluted Oscar's Hollywood homecoming in
a new venue at the Kodak Theatre with "The Gold Knight Returns," the
official poster for tonight's 74th annual Academy Awards. Ross, 32,
recently illustrated the oversize graphic novel "Wonder Woman: Spirit of
Truth" for DC Comics to mark the heroine's 60th anniversary, his fourth
in a series featuring Superman, Batman and Shazam! We asked Ross where he
gets his secret powers.</LD>
<LD>What do Batman and Oscar have in common?</LD>
<LD>   Naked characters with chrome bodies are very typical for comics.</LD>
<TE>   How did you research the poster project?</TE>
<TE>   The Academy loaned me an Oscar. I had it here in my house. I invited
family and friends and had a phony curtain, and we took pictures and
pretended that they received it in a ceremony. I photographed it, [and] I
also photographed the human body doing the pose.</TE>
<TE>   What did the Oscar statuette resemble before the superhero treatment?</TE>
<TE>   I look at it as an Art Deco representation of a man. The simplified
features of the face hold a Spartan helmet, and he's actually carrying a
sword. It's bizarre. You can't tell he's holding a sword. It looks like a
lump on his leg.</TE>
<TE>   If Oscar is a superhero, what's his mission?</TE>
<TE>   He's an angel of judgment who's come down from heaven to cleave bad
directors in two. But he will knight those who are worthy for their great
work, a la the awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   What is Oscar's daytime cover identity?</TE>
<TE>   He's either a courier or one of the nondescript [Academy Awards] vote
counters [for Pricewaterhouse Coopers]. When they decide not to give the
best picture award to "Lord of the Rings," he'll be the first one to know
what an injustice has been done.</TE>
<TE>   Who is Oscar's nemesis? His superhero Achilles' heel?</TE>
<TE>   Oscar's nemesis is the People's Choice Awards; his Kryptonite is the
Golden Globe.</TE>
<TE>   Does Oscar have a love interest?</TE>
<TE>   His love interest would be the female robot from the silent film
"Metropolis." She's his inspiration. She's gold; she has the same facial
details. There's a strong similarity. Comic book crusaders seem more
popular now than ever--take Michael Chabon's novel "The Amazing
Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay," or the "X-Men" books and movie.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   We're poised for a comeback. Comics and superheroes have been in a
slump. With current events, [superheroes] contribute to restructuring the
cynicism we are normally given to in this country. The very concept of
the superhero is about altruism. It's about those who "have" using their
abilities for those who "have not."</TE>
<TE>   Who would you give the superhero treatment to next?</TE>
<TE>   The Jolly Green Giant. He already looks like a superhero. He's giant.
He's already green. Or he could be a super-villain and run through town
destroying stuff.</TE>

<LD>We speak of "The Industry" as a single organism, but it's more a
collection of parts, of roles, high and low. Vivendi Universal's Barry
Diller is in The Industry, and so is Lawrence Bridges, the 52-year-old
Santa Monica ad exec who spent $300,000 to write, direct, produce and
finance a movie he now shows for free on the sides of Los Angeles
buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental whistleblower-turned-multimedia star Erin Brockovich is
in The Industry, and so is Ted Newsom,  who wrote a screenplay for
"Spider-Man" 17 years ago and is fighting to have his name included in
the film's credits when it finally opens in May.</LD>
<LD>   You'll meet these people--the mogul, the renegade filmmaker, the newly
minted celebrity and the frustrated  screenwriter--on these pages. You'll
encounter a novelist who is waiting--and waiting and waiting--for his
star  to rise, and an actor who is about to break into the ranks of the
"un-stars." And we'll fill you in on a few Industry strategies--the quest
to pick the perfect date to release a film and the philosophy behind
sequels,  prequels and remakes.</LD>
<TE>   These are the stories that won't make it to the screen, but they're
stories that often determine what flickers to life as you settle into a
darkened theater with a soda and tub of popcorn. And as any writer will
tell you, the backstory usually is what gives it all meaning.</TE>

<HD>The New Barry Diller</HD>
<DH>He's Back in the Movie Business, but Is an Entertainment  Empire
Enough to Keep Vivendi Universal's New Hire Engaged?</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's senior entertainment executives were sure of
two things when they unpacked their polar tecs at Robert Redford's
Sundance ski resort the first Monday of the Olympic Winter Games. One: No
matter how much work there was to do back at their Universal City
offices, this four-day retreat, Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean Marie
Messier's months-in-the-planning Olympic moment, came first. Messier
wanted to bond with his top staff, and nothing was to get in the way of
his familial yearnings. Two: Barry Diller--the newly named chairman of
Vivendi Universal's movie, television and theme park divisions, the
Hollywood luminary who Messier had proudly announced would be melding
them into a powerhouse team--would not be joining them.</LD>
<LD>   Where was Diller? Front row at a fashion show in Manhattan. What was a
mandatory outing for other top Vivendi Universal entertainment executives
was optional for Diller, who begged off the retreat, citing social
obligations with his wife, designer Diane von Furstenberg, during New
York's Fashion Week.</LD>
<TE>   This is Diller's third go-round as the head of a movie studio. And
this time, he's taking a decidedly laid-back approach to one of the most
demanding jobs in the hotly competitive media industry. Three months into
it, Diller hasn't seized power nor has he taken charge of Universal,
meeting only sporadically with his senior executives and almost never
with mid-level staff. He spends less than a quarter of his time in Los
Angeles, splitting the rest of his days among his three boats, homes in
Europe and Connecticut and his preferred base in New York City. He's the
same opinionated bulldog he always was, say colleagues, who cite Diller's
continued ferocity as justification for anonymity. But in business
meetings he seems to have lost the need to win every argument--very
un-mogul-like behavior for someone known as one of the last of that dying
breed.</TE>
<TE>   Diller just isn't Diller these days. He hasn't been yelling much over
at Universal; there are no reports of his throwing anything. And for many
in Hollywood, that's confusing. Diller says he's always been
misunderstood. He acknowledges that he doesn't always bring out the best
in others. While some former underlings, including Fox television chief
Sandy Grushow, say that working for Diller is "energizing," others say
it's debilitating.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who shouldn't be in the room with me," Diller says.
And, yes, he is known more for poking his underlings in the eye than
patting them on the back, adding: "I'm not a cheerleader."</TE>
<TE>   He's well aware that his ascendancy to the top floor of Universal
Studios' black tower has created anxiety within the industry that's akin
to an anthrax scare, but the 60-year-old mogul says his reputation as a
screamer is exaggerated. His relentless questioning of his staff is not
mean-spirited, Diller says; he's just naturally curious.</TE>
<TE>   What has Hollywood curious is the deal that brought Diller to Vivendi
Universal, a complicated and costly bit of corporate gamesmanship that
illuminates the ambition--and desperation--of Messier, the latest
out-of-towner to try his hand at show business. U.S. investors have been
shunning Messier's stock, so the 45-year-old French business school grad,
who hungers to be called a "first-tier" media baron, convinced Diller to
lend him some of the cachet that he lacks.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is part of Messier's $10.3-billion acquisition of the
entertainment assets of Diller's USA Networks--including the USA Network,
Sci-Fi Channel, a television production company and a specialty film
company--resources Vivendi Universal needs to become a full-fledged media
powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Diller is left running the remnants of USA Networks, now called USAI,
a tightly focused collection of companies (including Home Shopping
Network, Ticketmaster and Expedia.com) that buy and sell goods and
services on television and over the Internet. Diller's stake in USAI is
worth more than $1 billion, twice the value of his holdings in the months
before the deal. What's more, Diller can cash a no-strings-attached bonus
of at least $275 million one year after the deal closes.</TE>
<TE>   Diller could have taken that money and just focused his energies on
building USAI into an Internet titan. Instead, he agreed to the second
job: managing Vivendi Universal's entertainment businesses--excluding
music, a business in which he says he is tone deaf.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say that the arrangement makes no friggin' sense," says
Diller. "But it certainly makes sense to those of us who did the deal. It
makes perfect sense to me."  What makes "no friggin' sense" is that
Diller signed no employment contract, nor will he receive a salary. He
has no specific responsibilities or marching orders from Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Diller owns no stock in Vivendi Universal. "It is not incumbent on me
to do anything," says Diller, noting that this arrangement is "without
precedent. And so, by the way, is my whole life."</TE>
<TE>   That may be an understatement. Diller grew up in Beverly Hills and
attended UCLA in the early 1960s, but dropped out after a few weeks. He
was an instant success in Hollywood, moving quickly from the famed mail
room at the William Morris Agency to the ABC broadcast network, where he
launched the Movie of the Week. At 31, Diller became chairman of
Paramount Pictures Corp. In the mid-1980s, he jumped to Fox Inc., where,
as chairman, he rewrote the rules of broadcast television by creating a
fourth broadcast network.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is a man with total self-confidence," says one of his oldest
friends, Sue Mengers, a formidable Hollywood talent agent in the years
that Diller's star was rising. "Barry didn't make it on charisma. He
doles out his charm sparingly. He's just smart." Diller took on
mythological status in 1992 when he announced he was leaving Fox to start
his own company; he would be his own boss. After a decade spent wandering
the media landscape, suffering one disappointment after another, Diller
now has what he says he started out to find: USAI, a company of his own
with a stellar future.</TE>
<TE>   And life no longer revolves around work, Diller says, rattling off a
list of more important things: family, sailboats, travel. "Previously, I
woke up, put on my little suit, went to my office and stayed there until
it got very, very dark. All that changed when I left institutional life
and entered an entrepreneurial life. You can never, ever go back," says
Diller, who adds with a certain smugness: "I would never give up
independence. I don't think I would give up anything for anything. Why
would I?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect [Barry's involvement with Universal] to be long term,"
says John Malone, a cable industry titan who has a long and close
association with Diller. Malone's company, Liberty Media, has backed
several Diller ventures, including USAI. Liberty also holds a significant
chunk of Vivendi Universal stock. "Ultimately, his energies will go
toward his own company, USAI," which, Malone notes, is a better long-term
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Others who know Diller are not so quick to dismiss his interest in
Vivendi Universal. The power he can wield as the head of a traditional
entertainment company far outstrips the prestige Diller enjoys as the
head of a collection of Internet ventures. "He's right in the middle of
the flow of Hollywood at Universal," says one close friend, who asked not
to be identified. "Why not do it? He has command of all of these powerful
assets and nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Diller describes his assignment in less Machiavellian terms. "I feel
committed to help organize the integration of television and films as
well as I can," he says, sounding as if he's been rehearsing this
sound-bite for months. But he blows smoke rings around the future: "I'm
genuinely energized by the possibilities of collaborating with Messier,
in moving this company to first rank status."</TE>
<TE>   What, exactly, does that mean?</TE>
<TE>   The person closest to Diller, Diane von Furstenberg, his longtime
companion who last year became his wife, cautions against trying to
define her husband in traditional terms. "Why does anyone bother with
anything? He certainly doesn't need the money. It's because our work is
so much a part of our identity, for the fun of doing it, for the sport."</TE>
<TE>   Camping out in the office suite that once was the exclusive domain of
legendary Universal founder Jules Stein, Diller has decided he's ready to
explain himself, but the language he uses isn't exactly English; it's
mogul speak, full of references to "fractionalization" and
"consolidation."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in his version of casual (black jeans, black sneakers, a
long-sleeve white shirt with the cuffs buttoned and a yellow silk striped
tie thrown on as an afterthought), he repeatedly gets up, walks over to
his desk and checks his computer, anxiously awaiting an e-mail.
Electronic mail is Diller's favorite form of communication. He may send
hundreds of them in a day. Today's urgent message concerns the
finalization of USAI's latest acquisition, Expedia.com. Barry Diller may
be the chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, but his obsession
that day is with his USAI deals.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his state-of-the-art computer, there is little in the
Universal City office that belongs to Diller. The art--vintage movie
posters for "Dracula," "Frankenstein" and "Cobra Woman"--was selected by
the office's former occupant, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the scion to the
Seagram liquor dynasty who tried but failed to transform his family's
fortune into a media empire when he bought Universal in June 1995.
Bronfman sold Universal to Vivendi in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Diller understands that his arrangement with Vivendi Universal has
industry types scratching their heads. He has one of Hollywood's crown
jewels at his command, but he hasn't said if he has specific plans to do
anything with it. It's a nail-biter at the movie studio, where a team led
by Universal Pictures chairman Stacey Snider and her boss, Universal
Studios president Ron Meyer, has created one of the industry's most
collegial executive suites. Coming off of the studio's best year in ages
("A Beautiful Mind," "The Mummy Returns"), the team is nervously waiting
for Diller to swing into action. "What possible mar1667787118Diller. "The
thing that I hope is that Vivendi Universal can compete in the first rank
of media companies. It certainly already competes in the first rank of
movie companies." Diller hopes to calm fears at Universal. "My work here
is not to [cleave] the culture of Universal to mine. I tend to go to
where the trouble is."</TE>
<TE>   The immediate "trouble" at Vivendi Universal is a simple management
exercise: integrate the USA Networks assets and program five new
satellite channels created in December when the company bought a
$1.5-billion stake in EchoStar. By and large, the process will be
invisible to the public, except, perhaps for art film lovers. With three
specialty film companies--USA Films, Universal Focus and StudioCanal--to
be melded into one operation, the company will produce fewer alternative
films, but there won't be a dramatic falloff. Only one of the companies,
USA Films, has been on a roll, producing movies such as last year's hit
"Traffic" and this year's Oscar contender "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to what the outside world was speculating," says Meyer,
"Barry is not micro-managing the studio. I run the studio day to day.
Barry is focusing on growth."</TE>
<TE>   Diller attends meetings with top staff whenever he is in town and is
on the phone with Meyer every day. But the man known for his autocratic
style has shifted gears at Universal, according to several executives.
"I've been running this company very democratically," says Meyer. "I
listen to everyone's input. Then we make the final decision based on what
everyone has said. We all have input." Diller is part of that process.</TE>
<TE>   Snider notes that Diller hasn't attended any of the meetings where
executives decide which movies to make and how to market them. And he has
yet to set foot on the set of a movie in the making. "He does e-mail like
a fiend," Snider says. "Sunday mornings must be the time when he sits and
thinks. I get a lot of e-mails then."</TE>
<TE>   The movie studio is the business he knows best, and yet it is the area
where he feels most misunderstood. "All that silliness about how I was
going to come here with a new financial model for the movie business,"
Diller says with disdain. "Against all other businesses of entertainment,
making movies is classically, fundamentally the best and the least
futurely troubled. The only issue is how much it costs to make them and
market them. But those are electives that are within your control.</TE>
<TE>   "This company has done a pretty good job, really good," says Diller,
noting that he is happy with the way things are run at Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer and Snider both say that the company needs Diller to chart its
future, and Vivendi Universal's big challenge is to create more ways to
distribute movies, television shows and other entertainment. That means
either buying or building cable networks or a broadcast network, or
satellite distribution. Diller, who once tried to purchase CBS and later
considered a run at NBC, remains obsessed with overseeing a major
broadcast network. "We've absolutely got to have distribution outlets,
whether we buy them or build them or venture them," says Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Messier needs Diller to do more than just help him with distribution;
Vivendi Universal stock has fallen 25% since the deal with Diller was
announced in December. American investors don't think Messier knows what
he's doing in Hollywood. They don't trust European accounting rules. And
they don't trust  Messier with the future of the company. When he bought
Universal, he was effusive about the ability of his wireless company to
distribute movies, music and TV shows through cell phones and Palm
Pilots. Now that company, Vizzavi, is worthless and there is no sign that
anyone wants to use a cell phone to watch "A Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   "The common view [on Wall Street] is that Diller's role at Universal
is ceremonial," says Dennis Leibowitz, an investment fund manager with
holdings in Diller's USAI but not Vivendi Universal. Edgar Bronfman also
questions the decision to give Diller a role. "Barry is who he is," says
Bronfman. "He will focus on where he feels he has the greatest
opportunity to shine."</TE>
<TE>   But Messier is banking on Diller. "I am giving him the means of his
ambitions and I will benefit from the realization of his ambitions."</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate decision on everything at Universal belongs to Messier,
and Diller doesn't seem to have a problem with that. "All of this stuff
about 'Oh, my God, he said he would never work for anyone else,' " Diller
says dismissively. "With the one exception of 13 months with Marty Davis
at Paramount, I have always loved" working for someone else. Working with
Messier is a "walk in the park."</TE>
<TE>   What's so wonderful? His "ambition is wholly appealing," Diller says.
"It is almost affectionate ambition. It doesn't have a cold element to
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The ambition is to establish his company and himself on this world
stage of business with an emphasis on media. Most people's ambitions are
hidden, have a guilty flavor, or a complex mix of God knows what.
Messier's isn't hidden."</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, Diller was hired to take over Paramount Pictures, a studio in
financial disarray. "He brought control back to the studio," says Peter
Biskind, who wrote about those years in his book, "Easy Riders, Raging
Bulls." "The drugs, movies going over budget, it was a runaway train,"
Biskind says. Championing populist entertainment such as "Grease,"
"Saturday Night Fever" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Diller "took the
asylum back from the inmates."</TE>
<TE>   A withering stare and belittling Socratic interrogations became
Diller's trademark management tools. He disdained the foolish, which was
anything that didn't make immediate bottom-line sense to him. Underlings
remember Diller's constant refrain at both Paramount and Fox: "Not good
enough." Disney chairman Michael Eisner, who ran Paramount Pictures under
Diller, says if he went in with something Diller thought was a stupid
idea, by the time he left the office, "generally I'd think it was too."
Eisner says, however, he'd "rather negotiate with Diller than anyone
else. When he shakes your hand, that's it. You never need to worry about
paper." Still close friends, the two men take frequent bike rides
together in the Malibu hills. "People have trouble holding confidences.
Barry doesn't," Eisner says.</TE>
<TE>   Diller was a taskmaster. "Before Barry went to Fox, I would walk down
the halls at 5 p.m. and they would be empty," says veteran entertainment
attorney Bert Fields. "After he arrived, you could go there at 10 p.m.
and all the lights were on. There'd be people everywhere. If you went to
work for Barry, you damn well didn't leave at 5 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the constant tension, more than a few executives thrived in
the confrontational culture he created. "Barry is a very quick study,"
says Jamie Kellner, the head of AOL Time-Warner's Turner Broadcasting and
head of the Fox network in its nascent years. "He has good instincts
about where things are going."</TE>
<TE>   Diller relished risk, originating the idea of building a fourth
broadcast network. "Barry deserves credit for phenomenal willpower," says
Peter Chernin, who joined Fox in the network's early years and has since
risen to be the second-highest ranking News Corp. executive, after
chairman Rupert Murdoch. Calling Diller a "tough" boss, Chernin says, "He
willed the network into success--pushing, exploiting success, taking
chances. Barry was hard-driving, but he was fun. You could engage him."</TE>
<TE>   Diller's track record for training executives is unparalleled in
modern Hollywood. Besides Chernin, many of the top executives at Fox
today, including Grushow, are Diller alumni. At Paramount, Diller not
only hired Eisner but also Jeffrey Katzenberg, now a partner in
DreamWorks SKG. Kellner and Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president, both
started their network television careers under Diller.</TE>
<TE>   When he left Fox in 1992, Diller was on top, and he believed he would
quickly reestablish himself with his own company. But he was a
disappointed suitor in a bid first to buy Paramount Pictures, and then
CBS. While he failed to achieve his acquisitive ambitions, he did succeed
in making money. In 1992, he invested $25 million in the home shopping
company QVC and then sold that stake for $130 million after a year and a
half. By that time, the jokes about being the king of cubic zirconium
didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry's been the golden boy with the press," says Loews Corp.
chairman Laurence Tisch, who owned CBS when Diller attempted to buy the
network. "They love him," noting that his failure to purchase Paramount
and CBS ended up reading like good fights. There's a reason for the
favorable treatment, says Herbert Allen Jr., whose Allen &amp; Co. has acted
as Diller's investment banker on several deals. "Every time he goes to
work, shareholders benefit," he says, noting that he always takes a stake
in any company that Diller controls.</TE>
<TE>   After QVC, that loyalty was tested. In 1995, Diller, who was still
enamored with interactive shopping, bought into the Home Shopping
Network. He hoped to turn the television stations that carried HSN into a
chain of stations running purely local programming (think of local radio
with visuals). "It was a mess," says Larry Haverty, a portfolio manager
with State Street who has invested in all of Diller's companies. "He lost
$50 million to $75 million in the process."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Diller acquired Ticketmaster and other
transaction-oriented companies to complement HSN. But not until he bought
a stake in Universal's TV assets (including the USA Network and Sci-Fi
Channel) did Wall Street start to take note. Diller was back doing what
Diller did best: traditional media. Four years later, when he sold those
assets back to Vivendi Universal, investors were rewarded; the stock of
Diller's company had skyrocketed.</TE>
<TE>   "He often doesn't know how he will get out of it," says von
Furstenberg. "But he always does."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Diller in the New York offices that Naomi Leff designed for him
at USAI, a suite of top floors in a 57th Street building with outdoor
terraces facing the Hudson River, leaves a very different impression than
a visit at Universal Studios. The building is anchored by one of his
favorite haunts, the Russian Tea Room, next door to Carnegie Hall. Here
Diller appears at home. His office is filled with memorabilia, fresh
orchids, an 1860 painting of elephants by Andre Maire, a bust of Zeus as
a young man, antique maps.</TE>
<TE>   In his tailored pinstriped suit, Diller still doesn't sit down and
relax. He shifts his wedding ring from finger to finger, picks at his
nails and pops Listerine tabs into his mouth. He walks around the office,
lecturing about life, work and the state of the media industry, a subject
he relishes.</TE>
<TE>   The future belongs to the strong and the swift, according to Diller.
"Media is going to continue its trend of consolidation, which mirrors the
ongoing globalization. This is a natural law. It is in-ev-i-ta-ble," he
says, sounding out each syllable. "The other development is
fractionalization. More options for consumers, more choice, smaller
audience counts." Interactive businesses such as his will be a key
element in these conglomerates, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a business where you certainly didn't need to know
anything factual. Entertainment business is built on instinct and
willfulness," says Diller, noting that the entertainment industry became
more complicated in the 1990s. "These businesses, the interrelationships
inside them, the way they function, is so complex now. There will be lots
of dysfunction and reorganization of the next 10 years, and then, I
believe, the tracks will be laid. It will be done. There will be fewer
companies trying to capture audiences in various sizes and shapes and
relate them to each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I have thought, and think it more and more every day, to be
relatively young and be able to play a role in this period of so much
change is just the greatest good luck," says Diller, rocking back and
forth on the edge of his chair, smiling.</TE>

<DH>Choosing a Movie's Opening Date Can Be a High-Stakes Gamble. Here's
How the Pros Hedge Their Bets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE and RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picking a film's release date is like playing a million-dollar
poker game. With each weekend jampacked with releases, studio executives
know you can't just bet on your own hand, you have to guess what the
competition is holding.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, most adhere to one of several basic strategies. Summer
means popcorn flicks; winter is a natural launch pad for would-be Oscar
contenders. If you have a major event picture and announce your
intentions early, you might scare the other studios away from your
preferred date.</LD>
<LD>   And then there is the homage-to-past-success factor, in which studios
launch movies on dates that have proved fruitful in the past. ("Signs,"
the latest supernatural thriller from M. Night Shyamalan, will debut Aug.
2 in part because his first film, "The Sixth Sense," was a surprise smash
when it debuted the first weekend in August three years ago.)</LD>
<TE>   For years, the first weekend in June brought such Jerry Bruckheimer
extravaganzas as "The Rock" and "Con Air," while Disney often reserves
Thanksgiving weekend to launch animated family fare, including the two
"Toy Story" movies--at least until last year, when Warner Bros.'
600-pound gorilla "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" claimed the
date.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Dreamworks will release the Tom Hanks period drama "The
Road to Perdition" in the middle of July, close to what is known as the "
'Saving Private Ryan' date," says Terry Pres1932271684a long time since a
serious R-rated drama had been released successfully in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives celebrate "George Lucas Day." That was the Wednesday
before Memorial Day weekend, when the "Star Wars" auteur unleashed the
original "Star Wars" film. When Lucas re-introduced his saga in 1999, he
decided to placate the hard-core "Star Wars" fans by making "George Lucas
Day" a week early to give aficionados a chance to see it before theaters
got crowded with vacationing kids.--</TE>
<TE>The High-Percentage Dates</TE>
<TE>   Martin Luther King Jr. weekend in mid-January is the launch pad for
year-end films that previously saw only limited release to make them
Oscar eligible for the year before. It's also a good time to launch the
first wave of the new year's films. Examples include this year's "Black
Hawk Down" and last year's "Save the Last Dance." &gt;President's Day
weekend in mid-February is the only other pre-summer holiday weekend
that's targeted. Studios prefer the weekend before the holiday to launch
films, hoping to build momentum toward the four-day holiday. This year's
offerings included "John Q" and "Return to Neverland."</TE>
<TE>   The first weekend in May has become the unofficial start date for the
summer season. Movies such as "Twister," "Deep Impact" and "The Mummy"
have debuted in this slot. This year it will be "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Day is the official first weekend of summer. By releasing on
a Wednesday prior to the holiday, instead of the preceding Friday, the
studios create the possibility of six potentially big days. ("Mission:
Impossible II" and "Pearl Harbor.") This year, "Star Wars: Episode
II--Attack of the Clones" will break convention by starting on Thursday,
May 16.</TE>
<TE>   By the third weekend in June, most schools are in recess and the
seven-day-a-week pattern of summer moviegoing begins in earnest. Disney
traditionally has used this weekend to debut animated films such as
1999's "Tarzan" and this year's "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Summer's halfway mark. Depending on when the July 4 holiday falls,
studios open films either the Wednesday or Friday before. "Independence
Day," "The Perfect Storm" and "Wild Wild West" all got off to great
starts over this weekend. This year it'll be the "Men in Black" sequel
and the animated "Powerpuff Girls."</TE>
<TE>   By the first weekend of August, the summer blockbusters are usually
starting to wither. So the studios introduce a final crop of films to
carry through the end of summer and early fall. Past releases during this
period have included "The Sixth Sense," "Air Force One" and "The
Fugitive." This year it'll be the new Austin Powers movie, followed a
week later by Shyamalan's "Signs."</TE>
<TE>   The last weekend in September and first weekend of October are a time
to seduce fall-season moviegoers, usually with an action title such as
last year's "Training Day." Last year Disney got the jump on the other
studios by releasing "Monsters Inc." on the first Friday in November. The
same strategy worked for "Charlie's Angels" the year before that. This
year it'll be "I Spy."</TE>
<TE>   The weekend before Thanksgiving is the prelude to one of the year's
biggest movie weekends. "Harry Potter" launched at this time last year
and its sequel will do it again this year. In 2000, it was "How the
Grinch Stole Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Thanksgiving is a major holiday weekend for movies, with attendance
particularly heavy on the day after Thanksgiving. The Will Smith thriller
"Enemy of the State" was successfully launched on this weekend, and the
year before last featured "Unbreakable," starring Bruce Willis.</TE>
<TE>   The year ends with the biggest 12-day moviegoing period of the year.
Some try to open their films the weekend before Christmas, while others
open on Christmas Day. Last year, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
of the Ring" opened the weekend before Christmas, and "Ali" opened on
Christmas. This year, look for the second installment of "Rings."</TE>

<DH>10 Rules to Guide You Through This Year's Sequels, Prequels and
Remakes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think the titles and characters in the full-page movie ads
this year look familiar, you're getting the right idea. Whether out of
caution, laziness, lack of imagination or an acute marketing strategy
relying on all three, Hollywood is betting as never before that audiences
want to see sequels, prequels and remakes of things they've seen before.
An economic theory worthy of Galbraith or Greenspan, the Law of Sequels
is not new to the studios. But the profit margins discovered in recent
years by the accountants now in charge of production have elevated its
influence to new heights.</LD>
<LD>   Before "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," a sequel was
regarded as a conservative investment, a way to make, maybe, half again
as much money as the first film. The original stars often shunned them
and were replaced by cheaper talent. Way ancient history, dude. Now some
sequels are costing more and earning more than the originals, and the
stars are shunning none of that.</LD>
<LD>   There also is a whole new category called Franchise-From-the-Get-Go: a
bankable story with characters that can be projected ahead in time like
commodities futures to yield three, four, five or more related films.
Columbia, the studio releasing "Men in Black II" and "Stuart Little 2,"
among other sequels this summer, is introducing such a vehicle in
"Spider-Man," the Marvel Comics adaptation described gleefully by a
studio spokeswoman as "hopefully starting a franchise."</LD>
<TE>   Already before us loom new installments of "Harry Potter," "The Lord
of the Rings," "Halloween" and "Blade." Will we one day see "Rush Hour 7"
or "Charlie's Angels X: The Girls Go Through the Change"?</TE>
<TE>   "Why are franchises made?" asks Brett Ratner, who directed the hits
"Rush Hour" and "Rush Hour 2." "They can be $2- to $3-billion businesses.
Whenever a studio has a chance at something like that, they're going to
go for it."</TE>
<TE>   That's why we're in for a spate of continuing adventures, never-ending
sagas, the return and return and return again of the Mummy and lots of
Roman numerals. Escaping the dangers and dreads of the real world inside
the theater, we can be comforted by the feeling that we've been here
before. "Why did [ratings for] 'Friends' go back up after 9/11?" asks New
Line marketing executive Russell Schwartz. We think we know. As Austin
Powers might say, "It's deja view, baby!"</TE>
<TE>   Herewith, 10 rules to guide you through this year's top sequels,
prequels and remakes:</TE>
<TE>   1  Don't Be Confused by the Title.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you have followed a franchise from its inception and know the
difference between a prequel, a sequel and an unofficial spinoff, you may
need a manual to understand the precise context of some new films. This
is often not helped by the title. Members of the tribe of Lucas know that
"Star Wars: Episode II--Attack of the Clones," coming in May, is a
prequel, not a sequel--and not the second of the "Star Wars" films but
the fifth, taking place in cosmic time two installments before the
original 1977 movie that introduced Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason X" is the 10th film in the "Friday the 13th" high school horror
series about a supernatural serial killer that began in 1980 and has
continued beyond two attempts to end it: "Friday the 13th: The Final
Chapter" (1984) and "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday" (1993). This
year the filmmakers are sending Jason into outer space, but somehow we
suspect he'll find his way back.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Ice Cube serial comedy "Friday After Next" (due at
Thanksgiving) that follows the earlier "Friday" and "Next Friday" and
involves a ghetto Santa Claus who steals presents rather than delivers
them. If there's a fourth installment, they might want to consider the
title, "Thank God It's Not Friday."</TE>
<TE>   2  Like Gaul, the Life of Frodo Is Divided Into Three Parts.</TE>
<TE>   Millions have marched to the box office already to see "The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," but that was just the opening
segment of director Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's prose
saga set in Middle-earth. Two more are on the way. ("The Lord of the
Rings: The Two Towers" arrives at Christmas.) The studio adamantly points
out that the next two are not sequels but sequential installments, all
filmed at once (over three years) and parsed out in manageable cinematic
episodes. "We know that some people are going to call it 'Lord of the
Rings 2,' but not us," a spokesman says. "We look at it not as a sequel
but as the middle book of the trilogy. 'The Two Towers' will be
highlighted [in the ads] to give the film its own identity." Besides the
grosses.</TE>
<TE>   3  Don't Be Distracted by Current Events.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Altman observed recently that Hollywood has given terrorists
inspiration through its models of entertaining conflagration and mayhem.
But that's hardly reason enough for Paramount to be done with Tom
Clancy's serial CIA superman Jack Ryan, who in May will battle a
terrorist plot to blow up the Super Bowl with a nuclear bomb in "The Sum
of All Fears." In what sounds like a homage to the first Super Bowl as
Apocalypse film, 1977's "Black Sunday," this one is directed by Phil
Alden Robinson, that nice man who wrote "Field of Dreams." Maybe audience
members should be asked to show passport IDs.</TE>
<TE>   4  Beware the Hannibal Lecter Prequel That Looks Like a Remake.</TE>
<TE>   Before "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal," there was
"Manhunter," Michael Mann's loose 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel
"Red Dragon." It unveiled the flesh-eating serial killer Hannibal Lecter
and the odious Dollarhyde. Now comes "Red Dragon," directed by "Rush
Hour's" Brett Ratner, which revisits the original book and carries the
tag line, "How It All Began!" Yet Ratner insists, "This movie is not a
remake of 'Manhunter,' " which he believes is so different from the book
that they had to change the title. Promising more insight into the
origins and mythology of Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-winning personification
of evil, Ratner vows to complete the Lecter trilogy and has also cast
Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. "This will bring closure to the
character," the director says. "After this, there will never be another
Hannibal Lecter movie." Didn't someone once say that about Jason?</TE>
<TE>   5  Ignore the Critics.</TE>
<TE>   As if anyone at Warner Bros. needed to be reminded, "Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets" will roll out on schedule with the new fall line
of SUVs, oblivious to the drubbing that "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone" took as it broke box-office records. Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry,
will enter his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
and start hearing voices in the walls that tell him his mission in life
is to vaporize Kenneth Turan. Not really. If you are annoyed by issues
brought up by critics (plot holes, sentimentality, sadism, artlessness),
you might miss the sequels "Blade II," "Halloween: Resurrection,"
"Shanghai Knights," "Mrs. Claus: Santa Claus 2" and John McTiernan's
remake of "Rollerball."</TE>
<TE>   6  Don't Forget There Was a James Bond Before There Was an Austin
Powers.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought James Bond had become a self-parody of macho savoir-faire
long before Mike Meyers created his fractured alter ego in "Austin
Powers: International Man of Mystery" and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me." But MGM, Bond's studio, evidently is not in on the joke. The
studio cried copyright infringement over the third title of the New Line
series, which we must call for the time being, "The Movie Previously
Known as Goldmember," due in July. Michael Caine joins the cast as
Austin's dad, a clever bit of self-referentiality acknowledging Caine's
history in '60s British spy flicks. "We're doing a lot with the
father-son thing," says director Jay Roach. "We're trying to connect all
three films with this one." Roach says he and Meyers are fans of the
early Bond films and view their work as "a loving sendup."</TE>
<TE>   In November, "Bond 20" with Pierce Brosnan will remind the world what
all that shtick is about.</TE>
<TE>   7  It's OK to Realize That Will Smith Is Not Muhammad Ali. The former
Prince of Bel-Air won such acclaim for the verisimilitude of his recent
performance as America's greatest prizefighter, it's easy (or tempting)
to forget that five years ago he helped turn the science-fiction/action
comedy "Men in Black" into a high return on investment, playing an NYPD
detective recruited by special agent Tommy Lee Jones to fight
intergalactic terrorists plotting to blow up the planet. Come July 3, he
and Jones bring back their "cool suits and big guns" act in "Men in Black
II," whose tag line is, "Same Planet. New Scum." Same director, Barry
Sonnenfeld. Not the same marketing challenge. "It's no longer an
unbranded property," says producer Walter Parkes.</TE>
<TE>   8  Remember, Spock Left the Spacecraft in 1991 but Billy Crystal Is
Still a Shrink to the Mob and There's a New Mouse in Town.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on who's counting, "Star Trek: Nemesis" (due at Christmas)
is the 10th feature film about the Starship Enterprise and the third with
the new generation of characters, led by Patrick Stewart as a British and
less emotional captain than William Shatner was in the 23rd century.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Crystal does not make an appearance in the new "Star Trek" movie
but he will be back with Robert DeNiro in "Analyze That," a sequel to
"Analyze This," the Harold Ramis comedy about a Manhattan psychiatrist
who counsels a Mafioso. In the animated film "Stuart Little 2," the
6-inch hero with the voice of Michael J. Fox is on a quest to rescue a
new girlfriend ( Melanie Griffith) from a villain (James Woods). Fox is a
mouse, the other two are birds.</TE>
<TE>   9  Even if It's Not a Sequel, You Can Pretend It Is.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh has said that "Full Frontal,"
starring David Duchovny and Julia Roberts and depicting seven people in
Los Angeles who have little in common, is not a sequel to his
career-making "sex, lies &amp; videotape." But Miramax, with its hand on the
pulse of public taste, isn't so sure it wants to relinquish the idea
altogether, timing its Aug. 2 release to mark the 13th anniversary of the
earlier film's opening. The plots apparently are unrelated, but the
studio says that they are "related in spirit." Soderbergh says, "If I
were to make 'sex, lies &amp; videotape' today, it would look like 'Full
Frontal.' " This could be the ultimate proof of the power of sequels in
the marketplace: The temptation to ascribe history to a movie strictly
for business purposes.</TE>
<TE>   10  Look for the Mummy's Cousin and John Malkovich. In what is
technically a prequel spinoff of a sequel, "The Scorpion King" enlarges a
character introduced in last year's "The Mummy Returns." In that film,
the Scorpion King was a reanimation of someone who had been asleep for
5,000 years until awakened by treasure hunters in Egypt in the 1920s. The
prequel takes us back to his origins in the biblical city of Gomorrah,
where an evil ruler is wiping out all of the nomadic peoples of the
desert. World Wrestling Federation's The Rock, cast as a heroic hired
assassin, comes to their rescue. "It's a cousin [to 'Mummy'], certainly,"
says producer Kevin Misher. "We felt there was a character that had been
created that had its own story. I think the hope is that it spawns its
own franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Different story, different actor, but the Patricia Highsmith character
of Thomas Ripley, played by Matt Damon in "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"
returns in "Ripley's Game." This time the movie stars John Malkovich as
Ripley. Not a franchise yet, but it's only March.</TE>

<HD>Erin Brockovich, Inc.</HD>
<DH>It Takes a Lot to Be a Motivational Speaker, an Author, a TV
Personality, a Role Model and a Celebrity. Maybe It Takes Too Much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erin Brockovich (the woman, not the movie) has just finished
speaking for an hour and 15 minutes to more than 300 college bookstore
managers in Room 403B in the South Hall of the Los Angeles Convention
Center.</LD>
<LD>   It was a virtuoso performance by Erin Brockovich, the motivational
speaker, talking about the admittedly fallible life of Erin Brockovich,
the person. The session was billed "Take It From Me: Life's a Struggle
but You Can Win," which happens to be the title of a book by Erin
Brockovich, the author.</LD>
<LD>   The speech is an abridged version of a story that could fill a
country-western tear-jerker, or maybe a dozen of them. Dyslexia,
hospitalized with anorexia, two really bad marriages, one really good
one, guilt over an abortion, macaroni- and-cheese-for-dinner poverty, a
decision to get breast implants to help with her self-esteem, an alleged
$310,000 extortion attempt by a former boyfriend and an ex-husband, a
slander lawsuit by another ex-husband, the unexpected death of a brother,
a palimony suit by the ex-boyfriend, $250,000 spent on drug rehab
treatments for two of her three children, who range in age from 11 to 18.
Not to mention a bad case of mold in her dream house that she says made
her terribly ill, has cost her $500,000 to fix and launched a messy
lawsuit that so far has filled five volumes of paperwork at Van Nuys
Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Most people might prefer to keep experiences like those private. But
not Brockovich, not if she hopes to cash in on the celebrity she has
enjoyed since the mostly true-to-life movie bearing her name chronicled
how she stubbornly sought justice for a small town suffering from
pollution. Working as a low-level investigator for a trial lawyer, she
became the catalyst for a $333-million settlement by Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric for polluting the waters of Hinkley, Calif., with chromium 6.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Julia Roberts portrayed Brockovich in the movie, and last year
Roberts won an Oscar for her performance (forgetting to mention
Brockovich in her nervous acceptance speech). No matter that some
conservative critics accused the movie of glorifying trial lawyers and
questioned the science behind the Hinkley claims, or that some people
from Hinkley complained publicly about the small cut of the settlement
they got. The story struck a chord, grossing $125.5 million domestically
at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich did rounds of interviews, with Universal asking her to hold
off until just before the movie opened, correctly anticipating that
journalists would want to speak to the real-life character Roberts played
once they saw the film. "One interview turned into 450," Brockovich
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Brockovich had a book deal, a speaking tour, three agents from
William Morris Agency and, with luck, may in the future land a talk show.
Her celebrity is seemingly everywhere, part of an orchestrated effort to
continue leveraging the goodwill generated by the film even though it's
going on two years since it was released. "She's an industry now," says
Chris Newman, one of her William Morris agents.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning at the convention center, Brockovich, 41, is dressed
in a tight powder-blue blouse, black pants, spiked heels and a studded
black belt. Her blond mane is tied into an upright ponytail, the leftover
hair swinging around like a large tassel. She's told the bookstore
managers about her awkward first meeting with a surprisingly shy Roberts,
and how before the Hinkley case, secretaries in the law office hoping to
get her fired brought a yardstick to work to measure how far north of her
knee her skirts fell. She choked up reading a letter her father wrote
after punishing her for cutting high school in her hometown of Lawrence,
Kan.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes after she finishes, her McGraw-Hill book detailing all
that and more will be sale at a booth in the lobby for $8, a bargain
given its $19.95 list. Two dozen audience members line up to greet her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about empowerment," says Jeni L. Luft, director of the bookstore
at Montana Tech in Butte. Marlin Kinzer, director of the tech bookstore
at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, adds:
"I would consider myself a common man. She certainly relates to the
common man."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Michael Jastorff, director of the Black Hills State
University bookstore in Spearfish, S.D., who offers a simpler explanation
of why he showed up. "I saw the movie and thought here's my chance to
meet someone famous."</TE>
<TE>   The most important decision that created what Brockovich is today came
when the movie was christened. A movie about PG&amp;E and Hinkley could have
easily been "Erin B.," "Erin," "Just Erin," "Class Act" or "Lady
Justice," which were some of the other titles considered. But director
Steven Soderbergh and producing partners Jersey Films wanted "Erin
Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   At the wrap party, Brockovich asked Soderbergh what he planned to name
the film. That's when he broke the news to her. "Up until that point I
always thought I'd be able to disassociate myself with the movie, whether
it be good, bad or indifferent," she says. "There would be no name
recognition. When I realized it was going to be named with the name I go
by, it hit me that I really am attached to this movie."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of historical figures (Gandhi, Patton, Nixon or
Malcolm X) when does Hollywood ever name a hit movie after a real person,
let alone one who still stands in line at department stores, writes
checks and uses credit cards? Patch Adams was a real person played by
Robin Williams, albeit the nickname for Dr. Hunter Adams. Who remembers
that Jan Schlichtmann, played by John Travolta, was the real-life lawyer
in the hit film "A Civil Action."</TE>
<TE>   After choosing the name, Universal Pictures settled on a marketing
slogan for the film's posters, billboards and ads: "Julia Roberts is Erin
Brockovich." The more pertinent question these days is "Who is Erin
Brockovich?" now that she's in Act II of her celebrity. It's not a
question she can answer easily.</TE>
<TE>   Some days, she says, she is a woman who yearns for the anonymity that
preceded the movie, when she could spend hours investigating files
without being bothered, leave her name on a phone message without
worrying about the reaction or use a credit card without launching 20
minutes of questions and autograph requests.</TE>
<TE>   "My cover has been blown completely," she says. "I actually had a
meltdown the other day. I said, 'I'm sick of being Erin Brockovich.' I
can't get away from it, whether it be a check, a credit card or a phone
call. Yesterday I made a phone call to an agency. They flipped and said,
'Oh, come on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Demurrers aside, this movie heroine has become a multimillion-dollar
franchise and the most requested speaker the William Morris Agency had
last year, commanding $25,000 an appearance and logging 93 speaking dates
over 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Benia, chief executive of Toronto-based RCB Entertainment,
repeatedly invokes the term "brand" when talking about Brockovich. He
could just as well be talking about Procter &amp; Gamble's Tide or Walt
Disney Co.'s Mickey Mouse. "Here is a person who won the celebrity
lottery. When you do, you can do a lot with your winnings," Benia says.</TE>
<TE>   Benia books Brockovich into auditoriums and concert halls as part of a
package of speakers who have also included such prominent women as
activist Coretta Scott King and actresses Lauren Bacall, Mary Tyler More
and Julie Andrews.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who puts themselves out there like Erin to encourage a
transaction, whether its an emotional transaction or a financial
transaction like selling a book, becomes a brand," Benia says. "We're
kind of like brand managers. We put these five flavors out on the buffet.
Erin is clearly a distinct flavor. She's working to keep her brand
strong. She knows her buyers."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, keeping that brand going has involved appearing virtually
everywhere. Brockovich carrying the Olympic torch. An environmental
justice program at UCLA funded with $100,000 from Universal Pictures that
has her name and that of her boss, lawyer Ed Masry, on it. Speeches in
such places as New Brunswick, N.J., Milwaukee, Baltimore, Calgary and
Toronto, sometimes as many as three a week. There's Erin Brockovich
endorsing Democrat Tom Umberg in his unsuccessful bid for state insurance
commissioner, and the revelation in a recent book that Al Gore wanted to
recruit her to dig up voting irregularities in Florida when the 2000
presidential race hung in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   She hosted a prime-time ABC special in December called "Challenge
America With Erin Brockovich." Agents Mark Itkin and Chris Newman of
William Morris said the ratings were disappointing, and blame the time
slot it was given--10 p.m. on the Friday before Christmas. ABC executives
say it was watched by 7.2 million people, third for the night, but did
draw 29% more 19- to 49-year-olds than CBS' "48 Hours."</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich has even become a budding stage actress, appearing in the
Toronto production of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues," where,
according to the National Post, Brockovich was "showing off her legendary
cleavage in a black leather bustier."</TE>
<TE>   There is also the possible talk show, which has television executives
tripping over themselves to gush about her potential. "If you want to use
'Donahue' and Erin in the same sentence, that would be fine," says Linda
Finnell, executive vice president of programming for NBC Enterprises,
which in November shot a pilot for a syndicated talk show it is
developing with Dick Clark Productions. "We want to do a show that people
can walk away from and learn something."</TE>
<TE>   Itkin describes the concept as "a more contemporary version of what
Oprah does." Adds NBC Enterprises chief Ed Wilson: "What I see in Erin is
a woman who connects with America, a woman who stands for what's good
about our country. I see her as a great person for daytime television."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many things in Brockovich's life, a twist of fate put her
media career into overdrive. Three weeks after the movie opened, Candice
Bergen had to cancel a speech in Kansas City, Mo. William Morris agent
Betsy Berg knew Brockovich had grown up in Lawrence, Kan., just a 40-mile
drive away, and asked her to fill in. "It was a fluke," Brockovich says.</TE>
<TE>   With her parents in the front row and high school friends in the
audience, Brockovich made her first public speech before a packed Midland
Theater holding 2,800 people. Benia saw the potential of what she could
do on a speakers tour and knew he had to jump fast.  "It's not so
different from being on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade," he
says. "Here's a new piece of talent. Do you want to buy into her? That's
when we started to brand her, not as a movie but as an inspirational
person."</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich was wary of some of the offers. So was agent Newman, who
originally got involved because he was a college friend of her current
husband, actor Eric Ellis. Some were from fly-by-night operations like
struggling Internet sites. There were offers to appear on games shows,
even an offer to pose nude for Playboy that she turned down.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to be perceived as the bimbo with the big chest," she
says. "I really wanted to be perceived as someone who has a heart and who
has a brain, regardless of how I look."</TE>
<TE>   There also were nerves. She spurned "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"
because she was, by her own admission, terrified.</TE>
<TE>    O another recent morning Bockovich is sitting at a table in the
marbled Westlake Village office of her mentor, Masry, played by Albert
Finney in the movie. Masry, who gave her a $2.5-million bonus after the
Hinkley settlement, is now mayor of Thousand Oaks. Brockovich, despite
her hectic new schedule, has kept at this less-glamorous side of her
life. As head of the law firm's environmental investigations, she's eager
to drive to San Pedro in a few hours to meet with an expert witness, but
worries that she won't be able to make the drive in the allotted 45
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   As she talks, it's clear she is frustrated balancing celebrity with
the desire for the privacy she once had. She bemoans how just a few days
earlier she caused a stir at a Macy's cosmetics counter in the San
Fernando Valley when people in the store found out who she was.  "It's
very surreal. The glitz, the glamour, the fairy tale come true, the
Cinderella thing," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But Brockovich and her advisors also know that the window will close
soon. Benia cites the example of Marcia Clark, the O.J. Simpson
prosecutor who he believes failed to exploit her celebrity properly--
including taking too long to publish a book--and as a result faded
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich knows privacy will have to wait. She says she's well aware
that sports stars and newsmakers of an instant have tried, and failed, to
seize the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a window of time, and it is right now," Brockovich says.
"I've seen it build ever since the time the movie came out. I thought in
six months it would die down. A year has passed since the Oscars and the
momentum is still out there."</TE>

<DH>Ted Newsom Wrote a Screenplay for 'Spider-Man' 17 Years Ago. His
Fight for Credit Is Just One of the Steps on Our Hero's Tortured Path to
the Screen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trust a screenwriter to find the moral of his own life story in
another movie. In Ted Newsom's case, the movie is a farce.</LD>
<LD>   "There is in this whole affair a faint whiff of 'Duck Soup,' " he
says, referring to the Marx Brothers classic about a preposterous war
between two fictional European principalities. "Like that scene where
Trentino offers to call off the war and Groucho says, 'You can't, we
already have our uniforms on.' " It's a perfect analogy, he suggests, for
the war he never sought with the Writers Guild of America.</LD>
<LD>   Tall and wiry, with the world-weary air of someone who has navigated
the twisted logic of Hollywood's customs for too many of his 49 years,
Newsom is waging the loneliest fight in the movie industry. At issue is
his claim for credit on the script of what is almost certain to be one of
the blockbuster movies of the spring--the $100-million Columbia Pictures
production of "Spider-Man," based on the popular comic book hero.</LD>
<TE>   "Quixotic" does not begin to describe this battle. Facing him across
the trenches are some of the most potent names in town. The sole credited
screenwriter is David Koepp, whose other credits include "Mission:
Impossible," "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." Koepp's
source material for his script included a screen treatment written by
James Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that Columbia sees "Spider-Man" as one of its most
important projects ever. Or that Newsom's claim dates from a screenplay
that he co-wrote 17 years ago. Or--the unkindest cut of all--that the
Writers Guild, which for 60 years has been the sole arbiter of
screenwriting credits in Hollywood, has refused to consider Newsom's plea
to have the shooting script of "Spider-Man" scrutinized for possible
similarities to his own, as well as to drafts by at least four other
writers dating to 1993 and earlier. "The rules do not allow everyone who
seeks credit to be accorded credit," says Cheryl Rhoden, the guild's
assistant executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The guild's obstinacy perplexes and infuriates some of Newsom's fellow
"Spider-Man" screenwriters, including several who don't necessarily
believe any of their material was used in the final script. Some see the
guild as protecting Columbia, which might prefer to have its movie
associated with a single A-list screenwriter (Koepp) rather than a
handful of relative unknowns. "It smells funny, if you're the paranoid
type," says Ethan Wiley, who wrote a "Spider-Man" script in 1988. "I
can't understand why the guild insists that five or eight drafts of
'Spider-Man' don't exist. They exist, and there's a clear lineage."</TE>
<TE>   The genealogist of this particular family tree is Newsom, whose
curiosity was rekindled last spring when he read a late draft of the
"Spider-Man" screenplay by Koepp and discovered that the villain was one
Dr. Octopus--the same villain Newsom and his partner had written into a
"Spider-Man" script in 1985. "That was the flag that went up," Newsom
says.</TE>
<TE>   It was not that he felt plagiarized--after all, Dr. Octopus was one of
the villains in the original "Spider-Man" comic books on which his and
Koepp's screenplays were both based. But under guild standards, even the
selection of such details from original sources sometimes warrants
screenwriting credit for the initial screenwriter.</TE>
<TE>   As Newsom read through Koepp's draft and, later, the final shooting
script, he detected further echoes of his screenplay, including elements
that were not derived from the original comics--character traits,
relationships, bits of screen business and even snatches of dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself: 'Hmm, this may be more complicated than I thought,'
" Newsom says. Eventually he compiled a 25-page digest of similarities
between his screenplay and the shooting script, sent the list to the
Writers Guild for a ruling--and waited. About the last thing he expected
was the answer he received: Legal technicalities barred him from credit
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Fights over screenwriting credit are common in Hollywood. They seldom
involve claims as straightforward as plagiarism or copyright infringement
because it is understood that the studios own the screenplays and possess
the right to rewrite, mix, blend and otherwise manhandle them at will.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, when two guys go up to accept an award for a
screenplay, that's the first time they've met, and they hate each other,"
says Barney Cohen, who worked on an early "Spider-Man" draft for Cannon
Films and later created the television series "Sabrina, the Teenage
Witch."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the main recourse for a writer whose material has gone into
the Hollywood blender is to seek credit by presenting his or her case to
a panel of three unpaid and anonymous arbitrators chosen from the guild
membership. The arbitrators must read every disputed draft and calculate
the weight of every claimant's contribution. The stakes can be enormous:
hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and residuals as well as the
prestige and future commissions that flow from being associated with a
successful picture.</TE>
<TE>   The variations on credit claims under this process are potentially
infinite. It's not uncommon for screenwriters who have made minimal
contributions to demand credit--and for those who have made major
improvements to relinquish it voluntarily. (Of the four writers Columbia
lists as contributors to the final "Spider-Man" script, three--Cameron,
Scott Rosenberg and Alvin Sargent--voluntarily ceded sole credit to the
fourth, Koepp.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite its imperfections, this is a process that most guild members
have long accepted. "I've lost arbitrations many times when I thought I
deserved credit and won them when I didn't deserve it," says Rosenberg,
who is best known as the writer of "Con Air" and "Gone in Sixty Seconds."</TE>
<TE>   The disputes are often hellishly complicated, but the principle the
guild instructs arbitrators to follow is simple: The text rules. The
guild's manual for arbitrators instructs them to disregard "extraneous
factors," such as whether a project was already underway at a studio when
a script was written.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitrators also must disregard a later writer's claim not to have
seen earlier drafts, because producers or directors may have seen them
and passed story elements to later writers. "Although a writer may claim
in all honesty not to have seen any prior literary material," the manual
reads, "the arbiters must act on the basis that there is presumptive
evidence that a writer did, in fact, have access--if a significant
similarity exists."</TE>
<TE>   But the guild also maintains that not everyone who has ever written
for a project has a right to arbitration. That right belongs only to
so-called "participating writers" who were directly involved in writing
the screenplay, were employed by the production company on the story or
screenplay, or worked as professional writers in stage, screen or fiction
for at least three months. The guild contends, essentially, that because
Newsom did his work for a company other than Columbia, he doesn't meet
that standard.</TE>
<TE>   Guild officials refuse to discuss the specifics of Newsom's case,
including how it differs from other cases that the guild has subjected to
arbitration, or why he doesn't meet the other definitions of
"participating writer." They argue simply that the guild's standards for
defining "participating writers" are "fair and reasonable," in Cheryl
Rhoden's words.</TE>
<TE>   Others contend that, in this case, the guild is favoring the powerful
over the powerless, a tendency for which it has been criticized in the
past. "The obligation of the guild is to follow its own procedures and
give a guy a hearing," says Howard Suber, an emeritus professor at the
UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television and a frequent expert witness
on creative control issues. "I'd like the guild to come up with three
examples where they've come to the defense of weak writers despite
pressure from the studios. I suspect they'd have a difficult time of it."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom's supporters also argue that the guild's position ignores the
contractual maze characteristic of many projects in Hollywood. "What
happened to Ted presents a really difficult matter for a lot of writers,"
says Suzanne Spillane, Newsom's lawyer and an expert on creative rights.
"You write a script, it floats around, it's revised, and because of
corporate changes or corporate dramas, it becomes more and more difficult
to establish who owes an obligation to you. Companies go belly up and the
assets are gobbled by bigger studios, and the writers with contractual
rights are totally ignored. Ted and a lot of other writers are just
screwed."</TE>
<TE>   By Hollywood standards, the screenwriting history of "Spider-Man" is
simple, with only eight drafts truly at issue. The complication derives
not from the scripts but from the underlying reason that 17 years passed
between Marvel's first sale of the "Spider-Man" movie rights and the
character's appearance on the screen: the lawyers got their hands on him.</TE>
<TE>   The saga began with a character that Marvel Comics writer Stan Lee
sneaked into the August 1962 issue of "Amazing Fantasy," a comic book
Marvel was about to fold. In creating Spider-Man, Lee turned pulp
superhero convention on its head. Where Superman, for instance, concealed
his omnipotence by assuming a milquetoast alter ego, Spider-Man was a
nerd at heart--a bookish high school student named Peter Parker, the butt
of bullies' jokes, socially awkward, living on meager resources with his
elderly aunt. The mantle of fabulous power hung heavily on Peter's
shoulders; every summons to battle a master criminal seemed to mean
standing up a girl he'd barely mustered the courage to ask out in the
first place.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly, the "Spider-Man" issue outsold anything Marvel had
published in years. Within months the new superhero was confronting an
endless line of nemeses and personal dilemmas in the pages of his own
monthly comic. In time, Spider-Man crossed over into other media,
including a syndicated comic strip in newspapers, an hour-long
live-action show, and three animated series on American TV.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when Marvel put the feature film rights up for sale in 1985, there
were few takers. Hollywood was bored with superheroes. The Superman
franchise, launched to huge success in 1979, appeared to have suffered
premature arteriosclerosis with the release of the dreary "Superman III"
in 1983. Menahem Golan, a Palestine-born producer whose independent
company, Cannon Films, distributed foreign-language features for prestige
and Jean-Claude Van Damme shoot-'em-ups for profit, acquired the
Spider-Man rights for a mere $225,000. The first screenplay he
commissioned, by Leslie Stevens, creator of the TV series "The Outer
Limits," was by far the most eccentric, featuring Peter Parker turning
into a giant eight-legged tarantula. Apparently Golan and his Israeli
partner, Yoram Globus, had misconstrued the basic concept. "Golan and
Globus didn't really know what Spider-Man was," says Joseph Zito, the
first director Cannon assigned to the project. "They thought it was like
the Wolfman."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon hired Newsom and his then-partner, John A. Brancato, who had
written a well-received screen adaptation of another Marvel comic, to
start over. They kept close to the comic books' earliest story lines,
matching Spider-Man against Dr. Octopus, a scientist driven mad when his
pet project is shut down by corporate meddlers. Golan viewed Spider-Man
as Cannon's ticket to the big time. He budgeted the film at nearly $20
million, an enormous sum for the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "This was intended to be the film that put them in the 'A' category,"
says Zito, who had spent only $2.5 million making his first Cannon film,
the successful Chuck Norris vehicle "Missing in Action." Zito brought in
Barney Cohen, with whom he had collaborated on a "Friday the 13th" movie,
to rewrite the Newsom/Brancato script and give more screen time to the
full-fledged Spider-Man as opposed to the developing Peter Parker. Golan
and Globus dreamed of hiring Tom Cruise for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Cannon, undermined by suspect accounting, was already failing.
Golan ratcheted back his ambitions for Spider-Man until Zito finally told
him that the remaining budget was too small to do justice to the
material.</TE>
<TE>   Golan commissioned numerous further rewrites at Cannon, including one
he did himself under the pen name Joseph Goldman. Ethan Wiley, the writer
of the cult horror comedy "House" and a specialist in low-budget special
effects, was hired in 1988 to write a version that could be shot for
about $5 million. Soon after Wiley finished, however, Cannon collapsed.
Still holding the "Spider-Man" rights, Golan formed another company, 21st
Century Films, and hired other screenwriters, including Frank LaLoggia
and Neil Ruttenberg. Golan sent Ruttenberg and LaLoggia's scripts to
Columbia Pictures, which was contracting to distribute Golan's movies and
had the right to review the scripts. Columbia generated what is known as
"coverage," or a short critique, which praised Ruttenberg's draft for its
echoes of the recent "Batman" and "Superman" movies.</TE>
<TE>   But the Golan phase of the saga was about to close. Strapped for cash,
Golan in 1990 sold the "Spider-Man" rights, along with the screenplays he
had commissioned, to Carolco, another ambitious independent studio.
Carolco promptly hired James Cameron, then riding the success of
"Terminator 2," to write, produce and direct "Spider-Man" for a down
payment of $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The main product of this contract was what has become one of the
legendary artifacts of this complicated affair: Cameron's 57-page
"scriptment"--a hybrid treatment and script outlining the movie in a
prose narrative with interpolated snatches of dialogue. Cameron maintains
that he developed the 1993 scriptment exclusively from the original
comics rather than other screenplays. "He was aware that some prior
writers' material existed," says Rae Santini, Cameron's spokesman and
president of his production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. "And he
elected not to read any of it."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron painted Peter Parker in darker hues than the previous writers
had: morally ambiguous, profane, even sadistically violent. He gave
Parker's love interest the name of Mary Jane Watson, who in the comics is
a neighborhood girl attracted to Parker. But he also gave her the
snobbish, upper-crust personality of several other girls in the original
material, along with a drunken, abusive father. The arch-criminal is a
small-time hood accidentally invested with electromagnetic powers,
resembling the comics' Electro.</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes Cameron made in the source material was the nature
of Spider-Man's web shooters, which Stan Lee had conceived as mechanical
contraptions designed by Parker and filled with glue. Believing these
wouldn't go over on-screen, Cameron endowed Parker with organic
spinnerets growing out of his wrists.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Cameron's claim to have started from scratch, Newsom detected
a few echoes of preceding drafts, such as the villain's exploitation of
electromagnetic disturbances as cover for his crimes, which was part of
the story in the Newsom/Brancato version. Thanks in part to its author's
prominence and its endorsement by an enthusiastic Stan Lee, the Cameron
scriptment became the core document of the succeeding screenplays. But
its path from page to celluloid was not smooth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 Carolco went bankrupt. By then, Marvel was also bankrupt. The
lawyers soon discovered that Marvel had sold overlapping licenses for a
Spider-Man film to three companies on terms that were sometimes
contradictory and often poorly documented. Each of the licensees had in
turn sold pieces of its rights to others, with the result that MGM,
Viacom, Columbia Pictures, Warner Bros. and various Hollywood hangers-on
all claimed the right to make or distribute a picture about a high school
wallflower with fantastic powers. The legal maze involved four bankruptcy
cases and five lawsuits involving 18 separate written agreements. No one
was ready to back off. The lawyers would keep Spider-Man bottled up for
four more years.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1999, Columbia Pictures president Amy Pascal announced the
rebirth of Spider-Man. With the litigation finally settled, Columbia had
acquired the exclusive right to make the movie. Columbia viewed
"Spider-Man" just as Menahem Golan had 15 years earlier--as the basis of
a franchise that could stretch on forever, sequel building upon sequel.
Hollywood economics having evolved with time, Columbia's "Spider-Man" was
budgeted at more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   James Cameron, now in his post-"Titanic" king-of-the-world phase, was
no longer associated with the project. But Columbia had acquired his
scriptment from MGM, which had inherited the document out of the Carolco
wreckage and described it for legal purposes as "an undated treatment
identified on the cover as 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' a treatment for a
film by James Cameron."</TE>
<TE>   The other "Spider-Man" writers had moved on. Barney Cohen was
developing new projects and living on the annuity he had earned as the
creator of TV's "Sabrina." Ethan Wiley was working on a screenplay based
on the life of jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius, and Frank LaLoggia was
planning a $5-million stock offering via the Internet to finance a movie
about Michelangelo's creation of the sculpture "David." Neil Ruttenberg
was teaching middle school in West L.A. and writing a novel.</TE>
<TE>   The Newsom/Brancato partnership had broken up. Brancato scored a
success co-writing the screenplay for the 1997 thriller "The Game." (He
is currently writing "Terminator 3" for Columbia's parent, Sony Pictures,
and has decided not to pursue a credit claim on "Spider-Man.")</TE>
<TE>   Newsom occasionally wrote unproduced screenplays and worked on
projects for the straight-to-video market. In 1994 he anticipated a
moment of the Zeitgeist by directing "Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora," a
documentary about an inept Hollywood director that reached theaters just
before the release of Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," a big-budget feature about
the same director.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Newsom kept his finger on the "Spider-Man" pulse,
tracing the screenplay's fortunes in court and in preproduction. By 2000
he possessed a library of more than 10 drafts of "Spider-Man"
screenplays. In late May 2001, having learned that shooting had wrapped
on the Columbia version, he placed a call to the Writers Guild to ask
what procedure would be followed to determine screenwriting credit.</TE>
<TE>   "The question I had for the guild was pretty academic," he says. "I'd
seen the Cameron treatment and knew it was substantially different from
the previous material." He also knew that David Koepp's first draft had
closely followed the Cameron version. But Koepp's second draft, the
latest that Newsom had seen at the time and the one that reinstated Dr.
Octopus, struck him as a reversion to an earlier era. The use of Doc Ock
could be coincidental, he reflected, although any "Spider-Man"
screenwriter could have chosen from among scores of other villains
featured in the original comics. As he read on, he recalls, he detected
more traces of his and Brancato's script: the appearance, for instance,
of an officious corporate suit who thwarts Dr. Octopus' research,
triggering his villainous rampage, and who does not appear in the comics.
Once he received a copy of the shooting script, Newsom found other
similarities (although Dr. Octopus had been dropped as the heavy in favor
of the Green Goblin). The remaining similarities ranged from the jejune
(Spider-Man making a quip highlighting the taxonomic distinction between
insects and spiders) to the telling (in both versions, Parker discards
his eyeglasses after discovering that they now blur his suddenly perfect
eyesight--a scene that does not appear in the comics).</TE>
<TE>   Newsom grew convinced that he and several other writers might have
arbitrable claims. In his view, his and Brancato's contract was part of a
chain of title that ran from Cannon to Columbia via Carolco and MGM,
which listed it and contracts with six other Cannon and Carolco
screenwriters among the assets it acquired out of the Carolco bankruptcy.
"Spider-Man," Newsom reasoned, should be considered a single project
beginning with Golan and ending with Columbia. And he could show that
later screenwriters, including Cameron and Koepp, had access to reams of
prior material, including his own. Cameron, after all, at least
theoretically had access to his script, and Koepp had used Cameron's
treatment. Columbia had reviewed the Ruttenberg and LaLoggia drafts when
they were submitted by Golan.</TE>
<TE>   Newsom swiftly enlisted LaLoggia, Wiley, Ruttenberg and Cohen to
support his request. (Leslie Stevens had died in 1998.) The Writers Guild
was not interested. After Newsom filed his arbitration request in June,
nearly five months passed without a written response--to Newsom, that is.
In August, the guild's screen credits administrator, Sally Burmester,
wrote to Columbia's legal department to say that after analyzing the
material, the guild agreed with Columbia's position that the studio had
never acquired or seen "Spider-Man" material by Newsom and Brancato or
the four other writers and could legitimately exclude them from any
credit.</TE>
<TE>   The guild will not comment on the extent of its investigation or why
it failed to discover that several earlier scripts had been read and
"covered" at Columbia during the Golan era.</TE>
<TE>   Only after Newsom filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations
Board over the guild's lack of response did the union write back to him.
Although the Nov. 9 letter acknowledged that MGM had acquired the rights
to the Newsom/Brancato screenplay, it concluded that Columbia had
obtained from MGM only an option to the material, which it did not
exercise. For that reason, "Sony [Columbia] did not acquire the team's
material," said the letter by Cathy R. Reed, the guild's director of
credits administration. Furthermore, Reed wrote, "there was a significant
lapse of time between the team's writing agreement . . . and the active
development of the Sony Picture that commenced in 1999."</TE>
<TE>   As for Columbia, the studio was content to leave the matter in the
guild's hands. "They determine who the participating writers are and who
deserves credit," says Roger Toll, the studio's executive vice president
for legal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   To Newsom and his supporters, the guild letter read as though it had
reached its conclusions first, and then developed a legal rationale. The
guild seemed to focus on the contractual relationship among the writers
and studios rather than the texts, which were all that counted under the
guild's rules. It overlooked evidence that Columbia had access to
previous drafts. As for the lapse in time, many movie projects took years
to get to the screen, and 17 years was hardly a Hollywood record.</TE>
<TE>   The guild's position seemed to divide the "Spider-Man" project into
two parts, pre-Cameron and post-Cameron, and to render all of the
pre-Cameron work irrelevant. "It's a major problem," says Wiley, who is
furious at the guild's refusal to follow its own process. At one point he
asked a guild official what recourse he would have "if the final draft of
'Spider-Man' had taken my script word-for-word. She said my recourse
might be to sue for copyright infringement or plagiarism."</TE>
<TE>   If so, that's a huge loophole, because Hollywood screenwriters do not
own the copyright to their scripts. Those belong to the production
companies that hire them. In this case, the companies that employed
Wiley, Newsom and the others were hardly in a position to sue
Columbia--they are defunct. "I began to see that there could be an
opportunity for further abuses," Wiley says. "A producer might say, 'I'm
not going to technically obtain that material,' and thus would have no
obligation to give credit. And that puts writers in a precarious
position."</TE>
<TE>   The open invitation to bring a lawsuit also smacked of cynicism, given
the expense of litigation and the small potential return. "The guild is
telling them, 'Get thee to a courtroom,' but that's only for the hardy,"
says Pierce O'Donnell, the Los Angeles attorney who represented Art
Buchwald in his successful lawsuit claiming that Paramount Pictures
misappropriated his idea for the Eddie Murphy vehicle "Coming to
America." O'Donnell says he now reluctantly turns down such cases because
they almost never pay. "You get a first-time writer where the fee he's
suing for is maybe $250,000. One-third of that (the lawyer's cut) doesn't
cover Xeroxing costs. If you tell a guy he's outside the guild's
arbitration process he has no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Newsom's options continue to shrink as the May 3 premiere of
"Spider-Man" approaches.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be too late to argue for credit," he acknowledges. "We'll
continue to assemble a war chest and pursue it for four or five years,
and ultimately we'll win. It'll be a pyrrhic victory. It's idiotic
because the film will make a half-billion dollars, and this was never
about money. There's a bigger wrong to address here than one guy's script
17 years ago. What's the good of having the guild if producers can
circumvent it by not paying for something?"</TE>

<TE>   Thanks to your magazine and writer Michael A. Hiltzik for the
article on the "Spider-Man" screenplay saga ("Untangling the Web,"
Special Hollywood Issue, March 24). One fact seems to get lost in the
myriad complications: no one at the Writers Guild has ever read the
screenplays concerned. Barney Cohen, Ethan Wiley, Neil Ruttenberg, Frank
LaLoggia, several others and I were never afforded a hearing by our
peers--that is, other writers. The accepted process of arbitration was
circumvented by a toss of a coin in the credits administration, which
didn't read the scripts either. Also, although I thought Hiltzik's
article was terrific, he misquoted me quoting Groucho Marx in "Duck
Soup." The line should be, "It's too late. I've already paid a month's
rent on a battlefield."</TE>

<LD>Deal I</LD>
<LD>   I am 26 years old, confident and self-assured. When I option film
rights to my second novel to Warner Bros., giving them the right to
develop my book into a film, I am ecstatic. In a year or so they'll make
the movie and I'll join the ranks of the rich and famous.</LD>
<LD>   Because the movie will be a phenomenal success, my novel will rocket
to the top of the bestseller list. I will appear on all the big talk
shows. My face will grace the cover of Esquire. Above all, the New Yorker
will stop rejecting my short stories and recognize me for the brilliant
talent that I am.</LD>
<TE>   The novel is about three teenage brothers growing up in Los Angeles
with their widowed mother. It's called "Hot Wire," and the oldest brother
is an aspiring actor. The middle brother is a drug dealer. The youngest
is a habitual runaway. They are poor kids, reckless kids on a collision
course with life, and because I've lived this life, because I understand
the story, I want to write the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   The producer and I meet in an air-conditioned bungalow on the Warner
Bros. lot. He's in his early 40s, fit and tanned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific book," he says. "But I'm a little concerned.
Novelists are too close to their own work to make the necessary changes."</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of changes?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   He waves his hand. "Nothing major," he says. "We don't want to lose
your vision of the story."</TE>
<TE>   When our meeting is over I leave the bungalow determined to do a good
job. I'm prepared to be merciless, to cut and chop. I work long hours,
and in three months I've whittled a 300-page novel down to a 110-page
screenplay. But the heart of the book is still there. "You certainly know
how to write a script," the producer tells me after he reads it. "But
it's too dark. I think we need a fresh eye on this."</TE>
<TE>   In short, I'm fired and a fresh eye is hired. In this writer's
version, the oldest brother, the aspiring actor, is now the lead singer
of a rock band. The middle brother is the bass guitarist. The youngest,
the runaway, is the drummer. They aren't tough kids anymore. They aren't
even poor.</TE>
<TE>   That writer is fired. So is the producer. The executive in charge of
the project takes it upon herself to hire another writer. This one does a
fine job, but by the time he's finished the executive also has been fired
and the woman who replaces her has her own agenda. Unfortunately, that
agenda doesn't include turning my novel into a movie, and it soon falls
into that netherworld known as "turnaround," a graveyard where
once-promising projects are forever interred.</TE>
<TE>   The option lapses. My phone stops ringing. My book mysteriously
disappears from the bookstores, and a few weeks later I receive in the
mail another rejection from the New Yorker.</TE>
<TE>   Deal II</TE>
<TE>   I am 35 years old and a little less confident. When I option film
rights to my third novel, "The Second Story Theatre," to a successful
independent producer in New York, I'm excited but cautious.</TE>
<TE>   In a year or two they might make the movie. Because it will be shot on
a smaller budget, and because it will only be moderately successful, I
can expect this novel to sell better than my last but by no stretch will
it make the bestseller list. The New Yorker, however, will undoubtedly
catch wind of this independent sleeper, recognize my talent and publish
one of my short stories.</TE>
<TE>   This time the novel is about an old man who runs a little theater out
of a hotel in downtown Los Angeles, a hotel that's slated for demolition
to make way for a freeway. He and his friend, a young playwright, attempt
to stage one last production before the building is razed, and time is
running out. Of course, there's more to it, a lot more, which is one of
the problems with adapting it into a screenplay. But I'm willing to try.
The producer flies in from New York and we meet at Starbucks in
Brentwood. He's an older, impeccably well-dressed gentleman, and he
stands out in this crowd of mostly college students dressed in tank tops
and flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   "You realize," he says, "that there'll have to be changes."</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of changes?"</TE>
<TE>   He takes a sip of his coffee. "Don't worry," he says. "They're nothing
major." The producer is an articulate, intelligent man, and he gives me
several pages of notes, all of them insightful. I want to do a good job,
and once more I'm willing to cut and chop without mercy. Within six
months we have a strong screenplay with the original vision of the novel
still intact.</TE>
<TE>   The producer shops it around to actors, directors and studio
executives. A year passes. No luck. The call comes from Vermont, where
he's vacationing, and I can sense by the tone of his voice that he has
given up.</TE>
<TE>   "You wrote a good script," he tells me. "But they're all saying it's
too soft." The option lapses. My phone stops ringing. My book
mysteriously disappears from the bookstores. I think it's all over, and
then out of the blue he phones again to tell me, in short, that I'm
fired.</TE>
<TE>   "What I think we need," he says, "is a fresh eye."</TE>
<TE>   The new draft arrives in a manila envelope a couple of months later.
The story, which takes place in downtown Los Angeles, now opens in the
jungles of Vietnam. But I'm not shocked. I'm not angry. I set the script
aside after reading a few pages and reach for the other manila envelope
that also arrived in the day's mail, the one with my own handwriting on
it. It's from the New Yorker, and I'm hoping, as I split the envelope,
that someone has been kind enough to include a word of encouragement on
the enclosed rejection slip.</TE>
<TE>   Deal III</TE>
<TE>   I am 43 years old and not so hopeful anymore. Maybe I'm even a little
bitter. When I option film rights to my fourth novel, "Lucky Town," to
another independent producer, this one in London, I'm guarded.</TE>
<TE>   Before the year is up I'll deliver what I believe is a decent
screenplay and then I'll be fired. Because the movie probably won't get
made, and because my book probably won't sell any better than the others,
I'll bank the money I make and be thankful I got it.</TE>
<TE>   This is a coming-of-age love story about a son and his father and a
former prostitute with a passion for crime. They're on the run from the
law, beginning on the banks of the Willamette River in Oregon and ending
in catastrophe in Las Vegas. Of course, it's more complicated than this,
and capturing those complications in a script won't be easy, but I'm
ready to try.</TE>
<TE>   The producer flies in from London and we meet at the Westwood Marquis
hotel in Westwood. There we conduct our business over lunch under a
cabana at poolside. Like his New York counterpart, he is intelligent and
articulate, though considerably younger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific novel," he says. "But I'm sure you understand we'll
have to make some changes."</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of changes?"</TE>
<TE>   "Let's have a drink first," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He orders vodka on the rocks. I order seltzer water with a twist of
lime because I want to remain clearheaded. I like this man. He believes
in my work, enough to invest his time and money, and it's my
responsibility to do the best job I can. I also know that I'm not getting
any younger and these opportunities won't continue to fall into my lap.
Once again, when I leave our meeting, I'm prepared to cut and chop. The
difference this time is that the producer has already interested an
up-and-coming director in our project, and soon I receive pages and pages
of notes from both of them.</TE>
<TE>   I write a first draft. They like it and want me to do another. They
are talking to studios, actors and finance companies. There is interest.
There is buzz. I put in long hours on the next draft. I labor over every
scene, every line of dialogue. In less than a month I finish and send it
off.</TE>
<TE>   The producer calls after he reads it. "I like it enormously," he says.
Those are his exact words, and I can still hear them echoing in my head
when he phones a week later to fire me. "The director feels that it's
uninspired," he says. "What I think we need on this is a fresh eye."</TE>
<TE>   Before he can hire a new writer, however, the director hits it with a
big movie and wants nothing more to do with my story. The producer's
interest wanes. The option lapses. My phone stops ringing. My book
mysteriously disappears from the bookstores, and soon another rejection
slip from the New Yorker arrives in the mail.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like the same old story, but something has changed this
time. Something about it feels brand new. Maybe it has to do with that
third strike. Maybe it's about the other close calls, too, the hopes they
inspired and my coming to realize how few ever get the shots I've had.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure of one thing, though. It's not about Hollywood anymore, and
in some ways it never has been. This is about revision. Adaptation and
acceptance. The drafts are endless, but it's the writer, not the story,
that undergoes the most important changes.</TE>

<KH>The Actor</KH>
<HD>Wild Welshman on Board</HD>
<DH>Rhys Ifans Is Perhaps Best Known as the Underwear Guy From
'Notting Hill.' It Was Good Training for His Diapers in the Upcoming
'Human Nature.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET REITMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are a few things you should know about Rhys Ifans:</LD>
<LD>   He's Welsh. He describes himself as a "marionette on a bungee." He
pronounces his name "Reece," not "Rice." He's totally comfortable hanging
around in his underwear. He lives with a fashion designer, which means he
can't hang around in his underwear as much as he'd like. He smokes Benson
and Hedges, but only the kind sold in Europe, because those seem more
unhealthy than the American version. He will not apologize if he throws
up in an elevator after drinking all night. He would like to be a rock
star. He swears a lot. He thinks interviewing a phone book would probably
be more interesting than talking to an actor. Oh yeah, he's Welsh.</LD>
<LD>   Rhys Ifans may be the most interesting actor you've never heard of, a
situation his publicist, manager, agent and the people promoting his
upcoming film, "Human Nature," would like to change. They're trying to
spread the word.</LD>
<TE>   But Ifans is not adept at promoting himself. He dreads it. "I went to
Cannes with this film last year, and Cannes was the most despicable event
I've ever been to as an actor. It was show business in its stinking
extremis. I felt like livestock."</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, he's Welsh. He's reticent. There's something about doing
too well. Leaving home. Money. Success. It's embarrassing. "I don't need
to be a celebrity to leave this planet," he says. "I mean 'star'--that's
the best."</TE>
<TE>   He rolls his eyes at the concept, and it is here that you think: Oh
no, not another celebrity in a non-celebrity posturing mode. But Ifans
seems truly embarrassed by the whole discourse on stardom. And he's
wearing the same clothes that he wore last night. His baby-fine blond
hair is spiked in a bed-head hairdo that, you suspect, is wholly the
product of his waking up and forgetting to comb it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really think about that and about my image," says the
34-year-old actor. "If you approach it with this celebrity mask, you're
going to get screwed."</TE>
<TE>   But the interview requests are unlikely to stop any time soon. "Human
Nature," scheduled for an April release, is the second feature from
screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, whose offbeat 1999 comedy "Being John
Malkovich" was a hit in both independent and mainstream circles. Ifans'
"Human Nature" performance, as a feral ape man named Puff, garnered
praise at its Sundance screening in January.</TE>
<TE>   "What you get from Rhys that you don't get from anyone else is that
soulfulness," says Anthony Bregman, one of the producers of "Human
Nature." "He can be antic, and even dangerous, but in a totally disarming
and vulnerable way. But he plays it in a way that sucks you in."</TE>
<TE>   Ifans seems destined to be one of Hollywood's "un-stars." John Cusack
is one; Matt Damon is not. The aesthetic is quirky, but not so quirky as
to be inaccessible to the mainstream. The vibe is comical, yet dark.
Ifans' film roles have included a murderous, perpetually stoned twin
brother ("Twin Town"), an itinerant soccer lad recruited by an American
football team ("The Replacements"), and a laze-about Welshman who burps,
drinks, and spends most of his days in his underwear ("Notting Hill.")
Most recently, he portrayed a mournfully homesick Welsh journalist who
befriends Kevin Spacey's character in "Shipping News," perhaps Ifans'
most restrained role to date. In each film, Ifans morphs seamlessly into
character. The overall effect is a level of transparency that would be
haunting--were he not doing something that makes you laugh out loud.</TE>
<TE>   "When comedy is used as a sedative, it's awful," Ifans says. "But when
it's used properly--when it questions, when it titillates, when it
digs--then it's the most potent dramatic device there is." He is a fan of
Kaufman and Kaufman's directing/producing cohort, Spike Jonze, the
director of "Being John Malkovich." "They all use humor to seduce you to
think about the darker themes, which is the ultimate. It's like a
weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman doesn't quite know how to respond to this praise. He is famous
for his reluctance to discuss his work and sees himself as neither
subversive nor quirky, At least, he doesn't set out with that plan in
mind. "I try to think originally," Kaufman says. "I deal with things that
are important to me, and I've done it with comedy because I like comedy.
To me, anything that's really comedy is always dealing with something
that's hard, otherwise it doesn't have any resonance. "</TE>
<TE>   The characters in "Human Nature" aren't exactly likable; Tim Robbins
is an anal-rententive scientist and Patricia Arquette a hirsute woman.
Ifans plays Puff, a man-child who was raised in the jungle by his father,
who has an affinity for apes. Puff howls, masturbates in public, eats
with his hands--and is wholly satisfied with his existence. By the film's
end, he is a tormented, ascot-wearing sophisticate who can discern
between a salad fork and a dinner fork and hold forth eloquently on the
finer points of philosophy, and then engages in frantic, tortured sex
with prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the three characters aren't classically comedic, the film is
funny--it's a twisted take on "Pinocchio," in a way. It's central theme
is the inherent superiority of the natural world in comparison to the
aritificial; what is socially acceptable may win out, but the
consequences can be tragic.</TE>
<TE>   Ifans (who says he was cast by Charlie Kaufman's dogs--they howled
when they heard wailing on the audition tape) is comfortable with
abandoning what is socially acceptable, which came in handy since Puff
wears diapers for a good portion of the film. "Not every actor can appear
in diapers and not make you really embarrassed as an audience," says
Kaufman. "It's not about wearing them. It's about making an audience feel
comfortable with you wearing them, which is all about how comfortable you
are, deep down, with that kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Ifans "was completely natural," Kaufman says. "He made it seem normal.
And that's pretty impressive. Diapers are not like underwear. Diapers are
embarrassing. As a concept." So, one could argue, are saggy white
Jockeys, but then Ifans pulled that off, too, in "Notting Hill." As
Spike, the feckless Welsh alter-ego to Hugh Grant's bookish Brit, he
stole the movie. American audiences remember him as the Underwear Guy,
but Ifans is fine with that.</TE>
<TE>   Rhys Ifans cries. a lot. He cries when he thinks of Puff's childlike
innocence; he cries when he thinks of his Welsh ancestry; he cries when
he thinks of the first time he ever recited Shakespeare. And, somehow,
all of these moments are connected.</TE>
<TE>   The son of schoolteachers, Ifans is a product of Wales' vibrant youth
theater, and he won a scholarship to the elite Guild Hall drama school in
London at 18. He is passionate about language. He grew up speaking Welsh,
and still dreams in Welsh, he says. And when he says this, he cries. It's
not a sobbing, I-want-to-go-home moment, but more of a wistful one: an
acknowledgement that America, in spite of its can-do optimism, is
definitely not home, nor will it ever be.</TE>
<TE>   The word for this feeling in Welsh is hiraeth. It means homesickness,
Ifans explains, but an adult homesickness. "It doesn't mean you want to
go home to live. It means you want to go home to die."</TE>
<TE>   Ifans feels hiraeth constantly; it's an involuntary pull, like an
umbilical with a certain elasticity. The feeling reminds him that the
door he entered the world through is the same door he'll exit from.</TE>
<TE>   There is no English language equivalent for hiraeth. Nor is there a
simple translation for the experience of being Welsh, other than,
perhaps, "deeply confusing." "Tragic."</TE>
<TE>   "Beautiful." "Magical." "Horrible." "Alone." Ifans could talk about
Wales all morning. It's where he draws his strength, and much of his
humor, in fact. "You know, the highest accolade for a Welshman in the
Welsh-speaking culture is to be crowned as a bard .  .  . a man of
words," he says.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it's painful being Welsh. To have been conquered
and marginalized by the British. To have two languages--one for home, one
for the world. To be able to read the ancient texts and feel connected to
all that history. "You feel a bit as if you're in a line of people and
each is telling someone a story and you're at the end of it. Sometimes
it's beautiful, sometimes it's a lot of baggage." And here he gets teary
once more.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ifans is determined not to be a "tragic Welshman," as he calls it.
And so, the 6-foot-2 marionette on a bungee waits. It's complicated,
being an outsider. But it's a great place to be a spectator. Stardom, if
and when it comes, will be OK. But he doesn't need it. He will wait for
the right part to find him. He will trust in the magical, natural,
peripheral order of things. And yearn for home, where the rain never
ceases.</TE>

<DH>It Took a Dozen Years to Complete and It Screens on the Sides of
Buildings, but '12' Is the Movie Lawrence Bridges Wanted to Make</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ego. Money. Control. Power. War may be hell, but consider the
perils of making and distributing your own full-length film.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Bridges has written, directed, produced and financed his own
movie, a quirky film called "12." It cost about $300,000 to make and ate
up half a million feet of film. Bridges has missed holidays and family
gatherings; he's pulled all-nighters and, on occasion, relegated his day
job to the back burner. His movie is screened, guerrilla-style, for free,
on the sides of buildings throughout Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Forget focus groups and questionnaires. Forget filmmaking by
committee, by teams of screenwriters. Forget everything you ever knew
about movies and how they are made, released, and shown. (You might also
want to forget that it took Bridges about a dozen years--hence the film's
title--to finish.) This is the story of a guy who maintained total
creative control.</LD>
<TE>   Bridges is a 52-year-old advertising exec who owns Red Car, Inc., a
well-known editing and digital design company based in Santa Monica. At
23, he had his first real movie job as a production assistant on Francis
Ford Coppola's "The Conversation." At the time, he knew he wanted "to
make a film outside the film industry model," but he wasn't sure about
the direction he wanted his movie to take.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1988, while directing TV commercials and music videos,
Bridges asked three young actors--Alison Elliott, Tony Griffin and Allen
Lulu--to form a workshop "to explore acting on the big screen." Bridges
also was developing his own movie-making skills. "I owned a camera, had a
regular crew, and was able to offer filmed scene study to the three
actors in the workshop." Bridges found their collective acting chops so
impressive that he wanted to write something specifically for them. But
he didn't want to be part of a project that conformed to any template of
popular movie-making. So "12" was born.</TE>
<TE>   As the years passed, Bridges' cinematic conceit for "12" grew ever
more ambitious and audacious. Though the plot turned out to be
negligible, the movie plays by its own unique rules. Here the ancient
Greek gods are an eccentric bunch of Southern Californians feuding and
fighting like stubborn children. The movie concentrates on the journeys
of Marie-No'l West and her half-brother Filmore West, the illegitimate
offspring of Zeus. The goddess Athena is an on-camera reporter, Mars is a
Marine recruiting officer and Poseidon is a bottled-water deliveryman.
The siblings wind up stranded on an island ranch just off the coast of
Los Angeles, where they wait for their father to move them into new
lives. But Zeus has a few tricks up his sleeve and requires his kids to
perform Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest"--indefinitely.
The tone of the movie alternates between sitcom shtick and the explosive
shrapnel of black comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bridges' more daunting challenges in shooting "12" was
maintaining the same cast of 17 over the long shooting period. At one
point, Griffin and Lulu were so furious with one another over a botched
screenwriting partnership that they refused to appear together in a
scene. Bridges had to shoot them separately, and then splice. When Lulu
started out on "12," he was "a young Turk trying to make it in the
business." But by the time it was over, he "had a baby and a marriage. I
also had a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   Alison Elliott starred in "The Spitfire Grill" in the midst of making
"12." But she has nothing but kind words for what will undoubtedly be the
longest acting job of her life. "I would say it's rare for an actor to
have that kind of continuity with a project, to chronicle one's growth
and experience and how that changes someone's maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Making his own movie was far different from shooting commercials,
which Bridges describes as producing visual haiku. His work on "12" was a
way of getting at more gritty concerns, such as riots, floods and fires.</TE>
<TE>   "My camera was always loaded and the batteries charged, and often it
traveled with me in my car to and from work," Bridges says of his
hit-and-run tactics. "When there was a disaster, I was always ready to
document it." Amid scenes of real lunar and solar eclipses are scenes
from the 1994 riots.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Bridges discarded the tricks and techniques acquired as a
commercial and video editor and director. "I have a rule that something
has to happen every 10 seconds," he confides. Even in "12."</TE>
<TE>   as a stanford undergraduate in the late 1960s, Bridges concentrated on
literature and poetry. After completing his degree in English, he landed
work at several small editing companies. But in a few years he became
restless, and so he enrolled at Dartmouth and earned an MBA.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, he made his way into TV commercial work and music
videos, editing Michael Jackson's breakaway hit video "Beat It" in 1982.
But as the 1980s boogied on, he grew more dissatisfied with the standard
method of producing commercials. The accepted elements had become stale;
there were no visual risks to captivate viewers. Changes had to be made;
things had to be shaken up.</TE>
<TE>   Infused with this radical fervor, Bridges experimented, reconfiguring
the look of ads and their stories. One of advertising's new angry young
men, he made "anti-commercials" notable for their herky-jerky, hand-held
camera angles and lightning quick whip-pans captured on grainy film. In
1984, he edited the "Walk on the Wild Side" Honda motorcycle ad featuring
Lou Reed and his song of the same title, as well as the 1988 cinema
verite Lee Jeans campaign. The following year Bridges was selected Best
Advertising Auteur by Connoisseur magazine, the editors writing that
"whenever you see an ad that verges on art, chances are that Bridges had
a hand in it--as either director, editor or graphic designer."
Ironically, the techniques he pioneered as a backlash to formulaic
commercials are now staples of the industry, as well as hallmarks of
countless Hollywood feature films aiming for "realism."</TE>
<TE>   The same boundless but sometimes reckless enthusiasm is embodied in
"12," along with an earnest yet impulsive need to ransack tradition.
There's an aggressive air of disenfranchisement, something that dares you
to throw the first punch. But just when matters threaten to turn hostile,
humor swoops in and saves the day.</TE>
<TE>   Given Bridges' idiosyncratic approach to filmmaking, his method of
distribution makes perfect sense. On Friday and Saturday nights, Bridges
projects a two-hour, 15-minute version of "12" onto "appropriated" public
spaces and building exteriors on the Westside and in Hollywood. It's as
if he's created an instant drive-in. He has not secured permits or sought
local government approval to blitz "12" on city streets. He is, as he
puts it, operating "total guerrilla."</TE>
<TE>   On one particular night, as "12" flashed across the side of a building
in Santa Monica, a police car happened to cruise by. While images
flickered on the building's exterior, the officers sat and waited,
seemingly poised to take action. But after watching "12" for 15 minutes,
they simply moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Cohen, whose company manages an office building at Santa Monica
Boulevard and 5th Street where "12" has been projected, calls Bridges "a
muse," adding that the unconventional screenings are "a lovely thing to
do." But local governments take a dimmer view. Debra Scott of the Los
Angeles Department of Public Works' Street Use Inspection Division says
Bridges needs to clear screenings in the City of Los Angeles with her
department; he also is obligated to notify the Department of
Transportation and obtain permission from police and the Department of
Building and Safety. Deputy Sheriff Donald Mueller of the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department says clearance is necessary from the police and fire
departments for any screenings in West Hollywood; the city has street and
permit requirements as well. Amanda Schachter, a principal planner with
the city of Santa Monica, says Bridges is required to secure a temporary
use permit to show his movie outdoors in that beach-side city.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges is not concerned with legalities and statutes. A manifesto
posted on the "12" Web site, www.12.org/, declares "these screenings
reclaim the last patch of legitimate ground left in truly independent
filmmaking." In the same communique, he announces: "Art belongs to the
people and this film is my gift back to the city of L.A. It's a rolling
installation and tribute to my home city . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to delivering Bridges' war cry, the Web site serves as a
means of rallying the faithful to upcoming showings, posting times,
directions and maps to the secret locations where the movie will be
flashing. In this way Bridges recruits a growing tribe of predominantly
young urban nomads, numbering some 10 carloads of moviegoers at each
screening. (One devotee who had just seen the film remarked in a cyber
interview on the Web site, "This is so L.A. We're sitting in a car
looking at a wall!")</TE>
<TE>   On any given weekend evening on such instant screens as the Hollywood
Staples store off Sunset Boulevard and Wilcox Avenue, "12" bursts from
the darkness, commanding tall walls as a compact generator rumbles and
powers a projector strapped to a car hood. Viewers tune car radios to
103.1 FM, the soundtrack broadcast by a low-level transmitter that sends
its signal within a 100-foot radius</TE>
<TE>   .  Bridges' wife Betsy, a savvy woman who possesses no small insight
into human nature, has at times found herself mystified by her husband's
fixation. Bridges' work on the film has spanned nearly all of their 15
1/2-year marriage and the birth of their only child, Melanie, now 11. The
movie "kind of moved into our house, ever present" in her husband's
mind," she says. But rather than try and persuade him to abandon his
dream, she embraced it.</TE>
<TE>   "Betsy is a supportive partner," Bridges says, but quickly adds with a
double-edged grin, "I think she just wanted me to finish it before my
65th birthday." Would she characterize "12" as something decidedly
quixotic? "Probably."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone views "12" as a cinematic success. Carl Bressler, whose
agency represents cinematographers, line producers, costume designers,
production designers and editors and who was an executive producer of the
award-winning independent movie "Smoke Signals," isn't impressed by "12."
"If you are doing a flight of fancy it's best just to show it to your
friends," he says. Susan O'Leary, director of Fox Searchlab, a group that
develops innovative directing talent, calls Bridges a bold original,
someone who is "used to being the smartest person in the room." But
although she applauds his brash approach, she thinks "12" would be more
cohesive if it were shorter and that it does not have enough plot to
drive the film.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges remains unrepentantly proud of his fantastic creation. He sees

<DH>The First U.S. Venture for a Chinese Seafood Chain Arrives in the
San Gabriel Valley</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind the neon facade of Sea Harbour Seafood Restaurant in
Rosemead, I circle the parking lot, trolling for a parking  space until,
finally, six people pile into a gleaming luxury SUV. I grab their spot.
Just a typical evening at this Hong Kong-style seafood restaurant--so new
that beribboned potted plants given to the owners by well-wishers are
still lined up  out front, next to a pair of 4-foot-high plaster chickens
on either side of the entrance. Dozens of would-be diners crowd outside,
waiting for a table, with more inside pressed around the host's podium.</LD>
<LD>   A brightly lit, highly air-conditioned space filled with large round
tables, Sea Harbour has elaborate swagged curtains at the windows, a
couple of private rooms and the usual wall of aquariums backed in the
blue of a tropical paradise. There giant geoduck clams stretch their long
necks. Gray-blue prawns frolic in one tank, while in another red rock cod
doze in a heap. There are albino crabs and giant lobsters, too.</LD>
<LD>   An impressively large color photo at the end of the dining room
depicts a chef in his whites and toque, wearing a heavy gold  medallion
around his neck. It turns out Sea Harbour Seafood is the first American
venture from a chain that has more than 30  restaurants in China and one
in Vancouver, according to the gray-suited manager. "You mean this is the
equivalent of McDonald's?" asks one of my guests, wonderingly, taking in
the fish tanks.</LD>
<TE>   Reading through Sea Harbour's menu, my guests point out things they've
never seen before, such as goose web. What's  that? I splay my fingers
and point to the spaces between them. They're not interested. In
addition, there are dishes made with pig stomach,  fish head and, of
course, sea cucumber--a soft-bodied relative of the starfish prized for
its  gelatinous texture. Dishes that need to be ordered in advance are
marked with a tiny cell phone symbol. This Chinese chain is very with it.</TE>
<TE>   The menu also proposes some unusual, less exotic items everyone can
appreciate. Egg yolk meat patty is something like a moist, loose meatloaf
with a glaze of bright yellow egg yolk. Another dish offers a platter of
Chinese greens strewn with tiny bits of pork belly and starchy, slightly
salty preserved taro root. Instead of the usual hot and sour soup, Sea
Harbour's kitchen makes a splendid seafood version. Streaked with crimson
chile oil, the thickened broth is lashed with vinegar and brims with
calamari, shrimp, flaps of wood ear fungus, slivered shiitake mushrooms
and squares of tofu. It also holds shreds of egg a la egg drop soup.</TE>
<TE>   Another of my guests insists that the best way to order is to stroll
around the room and look at what people are eating.  After a waitress
rushes by to deliver a tempting-looking platter to another table, my
guest stops her on her way back to  ask, "What's that?" "Shrimp" is the
succinct reply. I somehow don't think my friend's tactic is going to work
here. The waiters' command of English is often shaky. A few managers,
though, are prepared to help non-Chinese  speakers with the menu.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately I have a list of recommended dishes from Chinese friends
who follow all the restaurant openings in the San Gabriel Valley. I'd
dutifully called the day before for those dishes that need to be ordered
ahead, but it's difficult communicating because the noise level in the
restaurant is so high. I managed to convey that we wanted to order the
salt-baked chicken and fish maw stew with Yunnan ham. And as soon as we
arrived that night, I reserved a couple of pigeons. (On another occasion,
we were out of luck, so it's probably a good idea to order pigeon ahead,
too.)</TE>
<TE>   I'd also reserved enough live prawns for a party of six. What else?
Dungeness crab was already gone that night, and the  suggested
substitution, crystal crab, weighed four pounds, and, at $26 a pound, we
passed, ordering a red rock cod steamed with ginger and scallions
instead. We're busy talking when the waiter reappears with a plastic tub
filled with wriggling  prawns and a bug-eyed red rock cod for our
approval. The fish seems awfully still. "Is he alive?" I ask. The waiter
gives the bright red fish a gentle prod and it leaps a foot in the air.
Definitely.</TE>
<TE>   Live prawns are a treat. Steamed just to the point where they lose
their transparency, they come with heads on and packed with skeins of
salt-and-pepper-colored roe. You can also have them pan- fried with hot
red pepper. Either way, they're wonderfully messy to eat--and delicious.
The Dungeness  crab, pan-fried Hong Kong style with chile, is worth
considering, too.</TE>
<TE>   For some bizarre reason, the management is intent on providing guests
with flimsy paper napkins instead of cloth. If you order the "deep-fried
tender pigeon" (and you definitely should), they'll provide a finger
bowl. The only way to eat the dark-skinned pigeon, which is roughly
chopped into smaller pieces and presented with the head on a platter, is
to just pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   While that salt-baked chicken won't win any beauty prizes, its firm
flesh is moist and succulent. Fish maw stew ($34 for the small size)
captivates the entire table. Ladled from a lidded casserole, the heady
broth is rich enough to cure any ill. In it are the occasional nugget of
fish,  silky shiitake mushroom cap or swatch of green. Fish maw refers to
the dried air bladder of a fish, used to  thicken the soup. Part two of
the stew is a platter of the boiled chicken used to make the broth.</TE>
<TE>   The menu is relatively easy to negotiate. There are actually two: the
regular 12-page menu that, while extensive, is  not the usual daunting
compendium of hundreds of dishes, and a smaller, four-page list of house
specialties, which includes dishes made with rock cod, geoduck and crab.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen also turns out superior fried rice, clean and fresh, laced
with shredded dried scallops and fluffy egg whites. Don't miss the bamboo
pith with mustard greens, the brilliant leaves topped with what looks
like clear loofah sponges (that's the pith), which soak up every bit of
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   I usually pass on desserts at Chinese restaurants, but Sea Harbour
Seafood's fried dumplings flavored with bitter gourd and stuffed with a
sweet black sesame paste are sensational.</TE>
<TE>   To anyone used to L.A.'s shutting up tight after 9 on a weeknight, it
seems unbelievable that people are still streaming into Sea Harbour
Seafood after 10. A cheerful clamor fills the restaurant while much of
Los Angeles is already fast asleep. As we prepare to leave, something
catches my eye. It's a net dipping into one of the tanks like the hand of
God.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Defense Team Offers Abuse List</HD>
<DH>Law: Attorneys allege that the so-called American Talib was both
misportrayed and mistreated by U.S. authorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Claiming John Walker Lindh was a soldier, not a terrorist, his
attorneys presented new details Friday of his initial weeks in captivity
and said the traumatized young prisoner cooperated with the FBI only in
the hope of ending mistreatment by U.S. authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The defense team also released letters written during that period to
Lindh by his parents in Northern California, who conveyed their love and
eagerness to help him and vented frustration over U.S. officials not
forwarding their mail.</LD>
<LD>   The one-way correspondence covers days of uncertainty, and it was not
until January that his mother, Marilyn Walker, learned he was still
alive.</LD>
<TE>   "You have been in my heart and prayers all these many months of not
knowing where you were," she wrote. "Finding you alive is the answer to
all of those prayers."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's arrest in late November sparked outrage in the United States,
fueled by video images of a ragged, bearded traitor derided as the
American Talib. He eventually was brought to the Washington area and
indicted by a federal grand jury as a terrorist whom Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft branded "an active, knowing participant" in the war against
America. He will stand trial in August and faces life in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his San Francisco legal team is working hard to soften his image,
and to blame the government for misrepresenting his actions in Central
Asia. The court filing Friday was the second in a week in which Lindh's
lawyers have begun to lay out their defense.</TE>
<TE>   Government prosecutors declined to comment on Friday's discovery
motions but are scheduled to respond in court on March 29.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the government claimed Lindh, 21, was a terrorist who met
Osama bin Laden and was trained at the Al Farouk camp in Afghanistan. But
his lawyers insist he was there merely to learn how to be a soldier in
the Taliban army and to fight against the Northern Alliance there.</TE>
<TE>   That central difference promises to be the key battleground in the
trial--whether Lindh truly sought to harm the United States.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their view, defense lawyers hope to gain access to
statements Lindh made to the FBI after his capture, and to keep them out
of the trial on the grounds that he gave them only after harsh treatment
by U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The defense said in court papers Friday that Lindh was "among Taliban
troops" who surrendered to the Northern Alliance on Nov. 24 near
Mazar-i-Sharif. When some of the captives exploded grenades and attempted
to escape, Lindh was wounded by shrapnel and a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   For several hours, according to the defense, he lay wounded on the
ground until fellow prisoners carried him to the basement of the
Qala-i-Janghi fort.</TE>
<TE>   He remained there for a week. "Mr. Lindh had almost no food, limited
water and virtually no sleep," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, U.S. forces fired about 40 missiles at the fort.
Northern Alliance soldiers tossed grenades down basement air vents,
poured oil or gasoline down the vents and set them on fire, and flooded
the basement with freezing water, the defense said. Most of these
prisoners died.</TE>
<TE>   When Lindh emerged around Dec. 1, his lawyers said, he was "in a state
of complete exhaustion and shock."</TE>
<TE>   He was taken into U.S. custody and kept for about a week at a location
near Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "He was surrounded by armed guards and held in a room in which the
only window was blocked, making it difficult to discern whether it was
night or day," the lawyers said, adding that he was fed sparingly and
given only minimal medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   They said authorities began interrogating him on Dec. 1, after "he was
told he would be provided a lawyer sometime later."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 3, San Francisco attorney James J. Brosnahan wrote to
top-level officials, including Ashcroft, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and CIA Director George J. Tenet, saying Lindh's parents "are most
anxious to meet with" their son.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan, noting that Lindh appeared to be wounded and hungry, also
asked that the interrogation be stopped, "especially if there is any
intent to use it in any subsequent legal proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, Brosnahan wrote to the Pentagon, saying that he and Lindh's
parents wanted to visit the prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   He closed: "John is a scholarly and religiously motivated individual,
who, at the age of 16, converted to Islam. His religious and scholarly
interest in Islam, the Koran and the Arabic language is well established
and brought him into his present situation."</TE>
<TE>   That same day his father, Frank R. Lindh, sent a letter via the Red
Cross.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama and I love you very much and are trying to find out where you
are being held," he wrote. " . . . Please ask the U.S. authorities to
allow me, Mama, and the lawyer to come visit you as soon as possible. I
hope you're feeling OK."</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan and the family heard nothing back about the young man's
situation. Unknown to them, the interrogation in Afghanistan continued
until Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lindh was airlifted to Camp Rhino, near Kandahar, Afghanistan.
"During the flight, he was blindfolded and bound with plastic cuffs so
tight they cut off the circulation to his hands," the defense said in the
court papers. "Soldiers threatened him with death and torture."</TE>
<TE>   At the American military base, "Mr. Lindh's clothes were cut off him,
his hands and feet were again shackled, and he was bound tightly with
duct tape to a stretcher. Still blindfolded and completely naked, he was
then placed in a metal shipping container."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh had no heat source, lighting or insulation in the container, the
defense said. Eventually a blanket was placed under the stretcher, and
one atop him. But "he slept little, if at all."</TE>
<TE>   There he remained until about Dec. 10. Still blindfolded and "in a
state of complete exhaustion," he then was taken to a nearby building or
tent, where he was met by an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mr. Lindh asked for a lawyer, he was told there were no lawyers
there," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   So he talked, because "Mr. Lindh believed that the only way to escape
the torture of his current circumstance was to do whatever the FBI agent
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 13, Brosnahan complained in a letter to FBI Director Robert
Mueller that he had received no response from any of his other letters to
Washington. Lindh's parents, he said, had received only one "short note"
from their son that was dictated to a Red Cross representative on Dec. 3
and arrived in California eight days later.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh was moved to the amphibious assault ship Peleliu in the Arabian
Sea the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "Our forces have provided him with appropriate medical attention and
will continue to treat him humanely, consistent with the Geneva
Convention protections for prisoners of war," wrote Paul W. Cobb Jr.,
deputy general counsel for the Department of Defense, in a letter to
Brosnahan.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 18, Lindh's father again wrote via the Red Cross. "We did get
your message dated December 3--my birthday. You have our unconditional
love and complete support. We are begging to see you. Trust in God!"</TE>
<TE>   Nine days after that, he again wrote through the Red Cross. "Mama and
I love you much, and hope to see you soon. . . . We hope you are well.
God bless you!"</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 3, Cobb, the Defense official, wrote Brosnahan, telling him a
chaplain who had visited the captive "reports that he is doing well
physically and is in good spirits."</TE>

<HD>Media Under Siege in Much of Latin America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>When President Hugo Chavez finally held a news conference last
month, his first since fall, journalist Laura Weffer asked a simple--and,
for her, very personal--question.</LD>
<LD>   The Venezuelan leader had given an angry speech in December telling
his supporters that the media were against them. Did he feel responsible
for the wave of violence that followed--the mobs that had beaten
reporters, the bombing of a newspaper office?</LD>
<LD>   Instead of answering, Chavez challenged the young reporter: Which
journalists were attacked? Weffer, punched in the face by a Chavez
supporter, placed a hand against her chest. Who else, he demanded to
know. A reporter stood up. Then another. Then another.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez simply sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "My dear girl," Chavez said. "I am not going to continue with this,
like a broken record. I have no answer to your question."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange was not unique to Venezuela. Throughout Latin America,
journalists are asking pointed questions as they come under fire in a
manner not seen since most of the region's repressive dictatorships ended
a decade or more ago.</TE>
<TE>   Groups that document such threats have registered growing numbers of
lawsuits, beatings and slayings compared to the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven journalist were killed in Latin America last year, according to
the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, compared with seven
in 2000 and six in 1999. Last year, for the first time in more than a
decade, journalists in Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay were killed in
connection with their work.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia, in the midst of a vicious internal conflict, continues to be
one of the deadliest countries in the world for reporters. Three
journalists were killed last year in connection with their work; another
five were murdered for unknown reasons. Two have been killed so far this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits threatening to silence reporters also have risen. A decade
after Latin American nations had enacted other democratic reforms, such
as more open economies, not a single country in the region fully protects
freedom of expression, according to a recent survey by the Inter-American
Press Assn.</TE>
<TE>   One of the problems is that legal systems still give special
protection to public officials, allowing them to sue over stories
insulting their "honor." Some 15 Latin American countries have such
rules, allowing senators and presidents to intimidate and silence
criticism through legal means. In Panama, more than 70 such lawsuits are
pending against reporters.</TE>
<TE>OAS Alerted to Situation</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become so bad that the Organization of American States
at its annual summit in 1998 created a high-level post to deal with
reports of threats against the media.</TE>
<TE>   Most alarming, perhaps, is that many court actions have come from
democratically elected officials. Panama's president sued a newspaper for
running a ribald political cartoon. Guatemala's government, which has
been at war with the media for their corruption exposes, approved new
licensing requirements affecting journalists. The measures recently were
suspended by the country's Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, a populist leader facing an increasingly unstable political
situation in Venezuela, has launched an all-out verbal blitz, accusing
journalists of blocking his leftist reforms and betraying the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists "cannot say they are innocent. No, here there are no
innocents; everyone must assume their responsibility before history and
the people," Chavez said during a December address in which he excoriated
the media. "People are tired of the lies, of the manipulation, of the
deception. . . . 2002 will be the year of the offensive."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks against journalist are significant beyond the threat they
represent to free and open media. They are an early indicator of a crisis
facing democracy in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade after every country in the Western Hemisphere but Cuba
had adopted free elections and free-market reforms, most nations still
find themselves mired in poverty, joblessness and severe social problems.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America and the Caribbean have the most skewed distribution of
income among regions in the world, according to a recent United Nations
report. In Brazil, for instance, the richest 10% account for nearly half
the country's income, while the poorest 10% account for about 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy's failure to deliver a better life to Latin America's
impoverished millions has endangered its future in the region. The
attacks against media are simply an example of a greater frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "With global recession and weakening democratic institutions
throughout the region, what we are seeing is a surge in systematic
attacks on the press and human rights groups," said Bruce Bagley, a Latin
American expert at the University of Miami. "It's worse than it's been in
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy is under siege," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A big part of the problem in Latin America is the increasing distance
between major political parties and the people they are supposed to
represent. There is a widespread perception of corruption and
ineffectiveness. As the parties have become less relevant, allowing
victories by populists such as Chavez or former dictators such as Efrain
Rios Montt, now head of Guatemala's Congress, the media have stepped into
the breach, becoming an often aggressive voice of opposition.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, has placed the media in conflict with those in power.</TE>
<TE>   When La Nacion, the most influential daily in Costa Rica, published a
story in 1995 about an honorary diplomat who had allegedly abused his
powers abroad, the diplomat sued and won a $100,000 judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, the paper won a decision from the regional
Inter-American Court of Human Rights suspending the judgment in order to
determine the legality of the country's "honor" codes, which make
slandering a public official a criminal offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly, the judgment has menaced us," said editor-in-chief
Eduardo Ulibarri. "It has produced not fear, but caution. There's great
worry."</TE>
<TE>   A final reason behind the increase in attacks against journalists
shows another worrisome trend in Latin America: As economic and
governmental reforms have advanced, the region's centuries-old legal
system rarely produces results. Most crimes go unsolved, and most arrests
do not end in convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "Impunity surrounds attacks against journalists," said Marylene
Smeets, the Americas expert for the Committee to Protect Journalists. "A
message is sent to others who are thinking of silencing journalists that
it is OK to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the problem of a government assault against the media
clearer than in Venezuela, where Chavez has seen his support drop
precipitously in recent months in the wake of unpopular reforms and
rhetorical battles with major institutions such as the church, industry,
unions and the media.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters by the hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to
oppose the recently enacted reforms, including one that allows the
government to force the sale of land for redistribution to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The protests have been supported, indeed promoted, by the country's
bare-knuckle media, which have contemptuously opposed Chavez's efforts.
One recent front-page editorial referred to the president only by his
first name and in a familiar form of address used with children or
between friends.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has responded by becoming increasingly personal in his
broadsides. In nationwide broadcasts that the government requires all
radio and television networks to carry, he has singled out journalists by
name as liars, oligarchs and worse.</TE>
<TE>   Most worrisome have been Chavez's recent exhortations to followers. He
has indirectly encouraged assaults against the media, in much the same
way that Shakespeare's Richard II doomed an enemy when he was quoted as
asking aloud, "Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?"</TE>
<TE>   The government "is not going to restrict freedom of the press," Chavez
said in a televised address last September. "This issue with the media is
something for the people, this issue and this problem is not for Chavez
alone."</TE>
<TE>Chavez Supporters Punch Reporters</TE>
<TE>   The verbal attacks took on physical form in early January when several
reporters, along with opposition politicians, were punched or hit by
rocks thrown by Chavez supporters outside the National Assembly during a
demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, a crowd of about 150 people--many of them identified
later as municipal employees for a Caracas borough controlled by a Chavez
ally--surrounded the offices of El Nacional, one of the country's leading
newspapers. Police dispersed the mob with tear gas and water hoses before
serious damage took place.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the end of January, a bomb blew out the windows in front of
the reception desk of Asi Es La Noticia, a tabloid owned by El Nacional.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that week, the tabloid's director, Ibeyise Pacheco, and three
other journalists had released a videotape that showed Venezuelan
military officers meeting with leftist Colombian rebels to negotiate the
release of a kidnapped Venezuelan.</TE>
<TE>   The tape reignited controversy over whether Chavez has links with the
rebels, though he insisted the contacts were purely a humanitarian effort
to aid the hostage. Pacheco believes Chavez supporters were behind the
attacks, though she has no proof.</TE>
<TE>   In her small office, which is packed with television monitors and
stacks of newspapers, Pacheco seemed undaunted during a recent interview.
She promised to reveal more ties between Chavez and Colombian rebels in
coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not cease to do this," she said. "We will continue."</TE>
<TE>Government Supporters Dismiss Claims</TE>
<TE>   Chavez and his allies insist that the media are more free than in the
distant past, when journalists were thrown in jail for their coverage.
And no reporter interviewed could cite a case in which a story had been
censored or suppressed in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "There is total freedom of the press here," said Willian Lara, the
head of the country's unicameral National Assembly and a former
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   But many journalists said coverage already has changed. Miguel Otero,
publisher of El Nacional, said the constant criticism has forced the
paper into an unwelcome role: that of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, he waved toward a darkened window in a bleak dun
apartment building across from his office. From there intelligence agents
were videotaping his every move, he said, citing military sources.</TE>
<TE>   Objectivity "is a problem now. Unavoidably there's a bias," Otero
said. "The media are the opposition. The church is the opposition. The
industries are the opposition. The union is the opposition. He has taken
all of us out of our traditional roles."</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to inform," Otero said. "We do not want to be
protagonists."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Ends Silence on Abuse at Jesuit Retreat</HD>
<DH>Courts: Relative files claim on behalf of two mentally disabled men
after one of accused clergymen is convicted, serves time and is freed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS GATOS, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Two mentally disabled men who live and work at a Jesuit retreat
were sexually abused by members of the clergy for at least five years,
according to court records and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   In a case that drew no public attention, one of the clergyman, Brother
Charles Leonard Connor, was convicted last year of committing a lewd act
on one victim. He is free after six months of home detention. Another
Jesuit, Father Edward Thomas Burke, admitted to his superior two years
ago that he engaged in sexual misconduct with the other victim, documents
show.</LD>
<LD>   Connor and Burke, both 80, are among four Jesuits named as defendants
in a lawsuit charging that the mentally impaired men were subjected to
repeated acts of sodomy, molestation and false imprisonment at Sacred
Heart Jesuit Center. Attorneys representing the California Province of
the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, have been
negotiating a monetary settlement with lawyers for the two victims over
the past year.</LD>
<TE>   Father Thomas H. Smolich, head of the California Province,
acknowledged that Connor and Burke took advantage of the mentally
disabled men. He said allegations that any other members of the Jesuit
order sexually abused the victims are unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, two men did things they shouldn't have done. We are not
denying that," Smolich said in an interview. "I wish this hadn't
happened. I want to make sure that it never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the California Province, Paul E. Gaspari, added:
"We're not saying sexual misconduct didn't go on. We're saying we didn't
know it was going on."</TE>
<TE>   However, police reports and internal memos reveal a pattern of
warnings followed by a reluctance to act on the part of some Jesuit
leaders--much like dozens of other cases of sexual abuse involving
Catholic priests that have surfaced around the country.</TE>
<TE>   An acquaintance of the victims alerted Jesuit superiors to possible
sexual misconduct at the retreat in 1995. Two years later, Santa Clara
County sheriff's deputies visited the Sacred Heart Jesuit Center after a
nearby shopkeeper, acting on behalf of one of the victims, made
allegations of molestations.</TE>
<TE>   Jesuit superiors at Sacred Heart relocated Burke in April 2000, after
he admitted having sexual contact with one victim, but they did not
notify authorities. Connor also was removed, but only after a sheriff's
detective threatened to have him arrested. The Jesuit superiors sent
Connor to a residence on the campus of the all-boys Bellarmine College
Preparatory in San Jose without telling school officials that he was
under investigation for sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Connor, three other Jesuits who are registered sex
offenders also lived at Sacred Heart in Los Gatos. Their offenses did not
occur at the facility and did not involve the two mentally disabled men.
Two clergymen were convicted in separate felony cases of molesting
7-year-old girls. The third, who served as associate pastor at Most Holy
Trinity parish in San Jose at the time of his arrest, was convicted on
two counts of oral copulation with a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the sex crimes by Jesuits and the abuses alleged in the
civil lawsuit have not been disclosed publicly. Unlike many of the cases
involving pedophile priests that have been reported in the media
recently, the abuses at Sacred Heart occurred in the last few years and
the victims are mentally incapacitated adults, who are granted fewer
legal protections than minors.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, the Roman Catholic Church has been grappling with
allegations of sexual misconduct by priests, and mounting criticism that
church leaders have been slow to act. To date, individual dioceses in the
U.S. have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to victims who said they
were sexually abused by Catholic clergy.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits make up the largest religious order in the Catholic
Church. Founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius Loyola, a Basque nobleman, the
Jesuits have more than 21,000 members serving 112 nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuit order is divided into 10 provinces in the U.S. Smolich
oversees 457 Jesuit members in four Western states and Hawaii. His office
is located on the property of Sacred Heart, a picturesque retirement
community for about 65 Jesuits overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Since he was appointed provincial in 1999, Smolich said, he has made
his position on sexual harassment and sex abuse unmistakably clear.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't tolerate it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smolich, 47, who reports directly to the Jesuit superior general in
Rome, said he believes sexual misconduct is not a problem within the
California Province. Aside from the four registered sex offenders, only
two cases of sexual abuse with minors appear in province files in the
last 15 years, he said. Both involved inappropriate touching, Smolich
said.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the Jesuits received treatment and are active again in
ministries, although their contact with children is restricted. Smolich
declined to provide names of the offenders or any other details.</TE>
<TE>   Of the seven clergymen convicted of sex crimes or named in the civil
lawsuit, five were previously employed at Jesuit high schools. Smolich
said his office is unaware of any prior complaints of sexual misconduct
filed against those clergymen.</TE>
<TE>   Smolich said that mitigating circumstances, such as the advanced ages
of the defendants and the diminished mental capacity of the victims, make
it difficult to determine the precise nature of the sexual abuse alleged
in the lawsuit. "This is hard. It is complicated," Smolich said. "We're
never going to know what really happened. We just aren't."</TE>
<TE>   Connor and Burke both cited their 5th Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination on numerous occasions during depositions taken
recently. They were not made available for comment by the California
Province or their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed June 19, 2001, in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, alleges that the two victims were sexually abused for "as long as
30 years." This claim is based on statements by the victims that the
molestations began within a year of their arrival at Sacred Heart, said
M. Jean Starcevich, the victims' attorney. The victims are seeking more
than $10 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The two victims at Sacred Heart are referred in court documents as
"John Doe" and "James Doe."</TE>
<TE>   John, 56, was born in San Francisco and contracted polio as a child.
He was raised in foster homes, attended Polytechnic High School in San
Francisco in the early 1960s, and moved to Sacred Heart on Oct. 8, 1969,
at the age of 24.</TE>
<TE>   James, 50, was born in Germany and adopted from an orphanage as a
toddler by a U.S. Air Force officer and his wife. His parents were
divorced when he was 10. He never attended school and spent his teenage
years in a state mental institution. He arrived at Sacred Heart on Aug.
26, 1970, at the age of 19.</TE>
<TE>   They were employed as dishwashers responsible for cleaning, drying and
storing pots and pans used in preparing meals for the Jesuits. They were
paid a starting salary of $150 per month.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of them being here was charitable," said Gaspari, the
Jesuits' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Before they were placed on paid administrative leave a year ago, John
and James earned about $1,000 per month with expenses deducted for room
and board. They still occupy adjacent rooms on the second floor of a
storage facility, which is is separate from the Jesuit residence. The
sexual abuse took place in the victims' rooms, according to statements
they made to a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>Acquaintance of Victim Reported Abuse in 1995</TE>
<TE>   The following accounts are drawn from criminal and civil filings,
transcripts of confidential depositions, police reports and internal
Jesuit memos. In addition, more than 50 interviews were conducted with
prosecutors, investigators, members of the Society of Jesus, lawyers,
guardians for the victims and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   The first indications of sexual misconduct were reported to Sacred
Heart in May 1995 by Dorothy Bernal, who had served as John's financial
advisor. She had heard rumors from the kitchen staff that Brother Connor
was molesting John. Bernal knew that Connor had taken John on trips and
spent considerable time alone with him. When she asked John about the
rumors, he "became very upset and began to shake" before saying that
Connor had been touching his private parts, according to a sheriff's
report.</TE>
<TE>   Bernal reported Connor to Father Greg Aherne, the Jesuit superior at
Sacred Heart at the time. Aherne talked to Connor, who initially denied
the allegations before admitting that "maybe he had done some
inappropriate touching" while giving John massages. Connor later told
detectives that he began giving John massages in 1985 to ease his back
pains.</TE>
<TE>   Aherne ordered Connor to read the California Province policy on sexual
harassment and misconduct, which specifically banned the practice of
Jesuits giving or assisting in massages "because of the liability
involved." Connor also signed a May 4, 1995, letter from Aherne that
instructed him to stay away from the victims. Aherne filed a separate
memo notifying Father John Privett, the California provincial at the time
who lived and worked at Sacred Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Aherne nor Privett alerted law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1997, the Sheriff's Department was notified by Holly Ilse,
a Los Gatos dress shop owner who had befriended both victims, that James
had confided to her that Connor was fondling him. Two uniformed deputies
in a marked sheriff's vehicle were dispatched to Sacred Heart to
interview John and James. Both men denied being molested and the case was
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, John and James each told investigators that they did not
say anything about the abuses because they had been threatened repeatedly
by Connor not to do so.</TE>
<TE>Another Call Alleges More Abuse</TE>
<TE>   Detectives reopened their investigation in the spring of 2000 after
receiving another call from Ilse alleging more abuse. At Ilse's request,
the Sheriff's Department sent a female, plainclothes detective to
interview John at the dress shop. John told Det. Dianne L. Camarda that
the molestations occurred at night in his room while he was sleeping and
sometimes in the shower.</TE>
<TE>   Camarda arranged to interview James at the dress shop. James recounted
one occasion in which Connor gave him a massage and touched his private
area. Camarda wrote that James "seemed very truthful and ashamed about
the incident."</TE>
<TE>   Camarda and a fellow deputy drove up to Sacred Heart and discussed the
allegations with Father Richard Cobb, the superior at the residence at
the time. Cobb told the deputies he was unaware of any previous problems
with Connor and that he preferred that John be moved off the property,
not Connor.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Camarda recalled telling Cobb that Connor had to go:
"You will move him. If you don't, he is going to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Connor was promptly transferred to the Bellarmine Jesuit residence on
the high school campus. "We had to move quickly. Given the circumstances,
we felt it was the best place for Charlie," Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Father William Muller, president of Bellarmine, said he received a
routine telephone call from Cobb's assistant requesting a room for
Connor. The failure to notify anyone at the high school about the reason
for Connor's transfer resulted from "a breakdown in communication,"
Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Connor was interviewed at Bellarmine by sheriff's detectives on the
morning of April 20. He proclaimed he had done nothing wrong and declined
a polygraph exam.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives returned to Sacred Heart with a search warrant
June 21. They uncovered Aherne's 1995 letters describing Connor's
misconduct and a three-page memo written by Father Cobb on April 21,
2000, detailing his conversations about Connor with other Jesuit
superiors. In his notes, Cobb recounted that Father Burke, the librarian
at Sacred Heart, admitted having sexual contact with James.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb wrote: "How long has this happened? About four years--in his
room. We always watch train videos. Yes, there has been some sexual
contact in my room. Last sexual contact, three weeks ago, in his,
[James'] room."</TE>
<TE>   Burke also told Cobb that he knew about Connor's sexual misconduct
with both victims. "He told me that [John and James] had confided in him
that Charlie Connor had in fact been touching them sexually for some
time."</TE>
<TE>   Cobb, in a sworn deposition, said that he went upstairs to the
provincial's office and told a top assistant to Smolich, "We got a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   No one at Sacred Heart notified authorities about Burke's statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits have no obligation under California law to disclose the
information to law enforcement, said Gaspari, the Jesuits' lawyer. "We
are not mandated reporters because these two individuals are not minors."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did anyone attempt to inform guardians of the two victims. Within
hours, Cobb drove Burke to the Jesuit community at Santa Clara
University, where he lives today.</TE>
<TE>Cleric Sentenced in Molestations</TE>
<TE>   In addition to implicating Connor, Cobb's memo led sheriff's
detectives to look at Burke as a possible suspect.</TE>
<TE>   On July 11, Sgt. Lawrence Goodman and Camarda went to Sacred Heart to
interview Burke. A receptionist told them that Burke was seriously ill
and staying with family for an indefinite time, the detectives recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Goodman and Camarda said, they decided to seek a warrant
for Connor's arrest and did not pursue Burke any further due to a lack of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits have no record of Burke becoming seriously ill or taking a
sick leave after he was transferred to the Jesuit residence. Smolich said
no deliberate attempt was made to hide Burke from authorities.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 17, 2001, Connor pleaded no contest to one felony count of
committing lewd acts on a dependent adult. He was sentenced to wear an
electronic monitoring device for six months, ordered to register as a
lifetime sex offender and forbidden to have any contact with mentally
disabled adults or minors. Connor completed his sentence Nov. 1 and is
living at a Jesuit residence in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and investigators said they were satisfied with the
outcome because it is difficult in sex cases involving mentally disabled
victims to secure a conviction in a jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence infuriated the guardians for John and James.</TE>
<TE>   "How can an old priest in Boston get nine years for touching a boy in
a swimming pool and Connor get no jail time for molesting his victims for
years?" Ilse asked. She was referring to the sentence in January given to
Father John J. Geoghan Jr., 66, who also is accused of molesting more
than 130 children over three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of Connor's sentencing, Ilse and James' sister, Debra
Sullivan, hired three San Jose lawyers to file a civil lawsuit on behalf
of the victims. The attorneys began gathering information and quickly
obtained the Cobb memo from the Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>'It's Just a Terrible, Terrible Betrayal'</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she was devastated when she was told about Burke's
admission that he had sexual contact with her brother. She and James had
become close to Burke, taking him on out-of-town trips and drives in the
country to see old barns. Sullivan said Burke spent hours and hours in
her brother's room watching train videos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a terrible, terrible betrayal," she said. "This is so
horrendous, so evil and so corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Smolich said he regrets that Sullivan was never informed. "What
happened to [James] shouldn't have happened. It wasn't fair to [James].
It wasn't fair to Debra. We are doing what we can to make it right."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she has put off filing a criminal complaint against
Burke until the civil lawsuit is resolved on the advice of her attorney.
"I want to see Burke in jail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A short time after learning about the Cobb memo, Sullivan said, she
sat down with her brother to discuss the molestations. According to
Sullivan's sworn deposition, James identified six Jesuits at Sacred Heart
who sexually abused him: Burke, Connor, two other brothers named in the
lawsuit, a "Brother Moniz" and a man named "Angel."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she recognized four of the names from her frequent
visits to Sacred Heart over the past two decades. But she had never heard
of Moniz or anyone named "Angel."</TE>
<TE>Two Men Registered as Sex Offenders</TE>
<TE>   Brother John Rodrigues Moniz, 80, and Father Angel Mariano, 46, are
registered sex offenders who were convicted of felony sex crimes with
minors. Both have lived at Sacred Heart in recent years. Neither man has
been accused in criminal or civil courts of molesting John or James.</TE>
<TE>   Moniz was convicted in 1995 after pleading no contest to one felony
count of lewd conduct with a minor for fondling a 7-year-old girl in Los
Gatos. He was placed on three years' probation, ordered to have no
contact with children and required to pay his victim's uninsured medical
expenses and psychological treatment. He now lives at Vianney Renewal
Center in Dittmer, Mo., a facility for sex offenders run by Paraclete
priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was arrested about midnight Sept. 21, 1998, in Campbell,
Calif., near San Jose when a police officer caught him in a sex act with
a 17-year-old student in a parked car. According to police reports,
Mariano arranged to meet two teenagers by posing as a 25-year-old woman
on an Internet chat room. He wore lipstick and rouge when he met the
boys.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was convicted March 16, 1999, on two felony counts of oral
copulation with a minor and spent five months in Santa Clara County Jail.
Before his arrest, Mariano served as an associate pastor for four years
at Most Holy Trinity Church in San Jose, one of 14 parishes that are
staffed by Jesuits within the province.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was removed without any explanation. Asked why parishioners at
Holy Trinity were not made aware of the reasons for Mariano's departure,
Smolich said: "Why should they? This is an Internet cruising thing. This
is anonymous sex. This doesn't involve people at the parish. It wasn't a
priest thing. He wasn't dressed in a collar."</TE>
<TE>   Before he was ordained, Mariano taught at Bellarmine from 1988 to
1991. Since his arrest, Mariano lived at Sacred Heart off and on for
about four months.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of two mentally disabled victims of sexual abuse at
Sacred Heart was "never a consideration" when Mariano was assigned to
live there, Smolich said. "He needed a place to come back to. The issues
around Father Mariano's situation have nothing to do with mentally
disabled adults," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano had virtually no contact of any kind with either victim at
Sacred Heart, Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano is living under the supervision of Smolich and his top
assistant, Father Tony Sholander, at their residence near Santa Clara
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, his opportunities for ministry in the future are circumspect
at best," Smolich said. "I'm not going to assign him somewhere where he
has any contact with minors. I can't and I won't."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth registered sex offender, Father James Thomas Monaghan, was
convicted in 1992 of felony lewd conduct for fondling a 7-year-old girl
who was brought to him for counseling while he was pastor of St. Ignatius
parish in Sacramento. Monaghan, 87, is now in the infirmary at Sacred
Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Because Jesuits are required take a vow of poverty, they are not
thrown out of the ministry when they encounter legal problems, Smolich
said. Recently, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese
dismissed about a half dozen priests who previously had engaged in sexual
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Diocesan priests have retirement accounts," Smolich said. "They can
leave and take care of themselves. Men who have spent their lives in the
Jesuit order have nothing. We are not in a position to throw them out. I
wouldn't do it."</TE>

<DL>SAMARA, Russia
</DL>
<LD>Among the barbed wire and gray barracks of Women's Prison No. 15
stands a square building painted a cheerful pink where the laughter of
toddlers mingles with the gentle voices of doting mothers.</LD>
<LD>   An island of innocence in an otherwise gloomy landscape, the nursery
is home to 37 children whose mothers are serving sentences. But thanks to
an act of Kremlin clemency, the rows of cribs could soon be empty.</LD>
<LD>   Russia's network of prison nurseries, which house the children of
minor offenders and murderers alike, reflects the privileged place of
motherhood in Russian culture. Prison officials say the system allows
mothers and children to form a crucial bond--even if it is often followed
by a painful separation when the child is sent to an orphanage at age 3.</LD>
<TE>   But in January, President Vladimir Putin went a step further for
incarcerated mothers, recommending that all female inmates with children
in prison nurseries be pardoned. Regardless of their crimes or how much
of their sentences are left to serve, inmate mothers are expected to be
released with their babies in a few months.</TE>
<TE>   Much remains unclear about how the pardons will be implemented, and
the announcement has stirred fears among prison wardens that even women
who are not dedicated to their children will be freed. But Kremlin
officials say pardons will be granted only to mothers whose children
would be best served by their early release.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 45,000 women in Russian prisons, nearly 500 have small children
who live in prison nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   At the Samara prison, about 550 miles southeast of Moscow, mothers get
two 1-hour visits with their children a day. Nursing mothers also get
four shorter visits for feedings. Once children reach age 3, they are
transferred to orphanages if their mothers still have more than a year
left to serve.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is good here, but raising a child in a home setting would
be better," says Yaroslava Kachurka, 24, as she cradles Yuliana, a
3-month-old girl. "Now there's been talk of pardoning us, so we're
hoping."</TE>
<TE>   Black lines from smudged mascara run down the cheeks of Inna Kartseva,
23, when she talks about her life behind bars with Viktor, also 3 months.
Born in the prison hospital, Viktor has never seen his father, who is
also in prison. Kartseva and her husband were convicted on drug charges,
but she maintains they are innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "When they put us in jail, it seemed as if life was over. Thank God
for this child," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Nursery director Tatyana Skvortsova says she would welcome pardons,
but not for all mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are great moms, but there are some who have to be
dragged in to play with their children," she says, citing a woman who
left her baby on a park bench a month after her parole last year.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, mothers may love their children but be unable to care
for them due to a lack of housing or strong family ties, Skvortsova says.</TE>
<TE>   In such situations, Russia's social welfare agencies have little to
offer beyond putting children in orphanages. Help for families plagued by
poverty, abuse or alcoholism is virtually nonexistent. Children's
advocates say this is a major reason for the country's large number of
street children--a problem Putin vows to tackle.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, prison may be the best place for some mothers and
children, many prison officials say.</TE>
<TE>   If the mothers are pardoned, "I can't guarantee that these children
won't fill up the cellars and train stations," says Valery Yakovlev,
acting chief of the Samara region's prison system.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Kremlin plan, mothers' cases will be reviewed by
regional pardon commissions that are still being formed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the amnesties that the Russian parliament periodically passes
for minor criminals to relieve overcrowding in prisons, motherhood
pardons could be applied to those convicted of murder and other serious
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the new pardons nor the prison nursery offer much comfort to
most mothers held at Prison No. 15--the majority of whom have children on
the outside.</TE>
<TE>   These women fill their days sewing military and hospital uniforms at
the prison factory, rehearsing their acts for the prison talent show and
watching TV soap operas. The pink building stands as a reminder of what
they're missing.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Svetlana Mardagaliyeva's son turned 3 and was transferred
to an orphanage. There is no guarantee they will be reunited even after
she has served her remaining 4 1/2 years. To get him back, she will have
to prove she has housing and a steady income.</TE>
<TE>   "Something still draws me to the nursery, but what?" she says. "I
guess it's just habit."</TE>

<HD>Belfast Sets Its Sights on Loftier Status</HD>
<DH>Cities: Becoming Europe's Capital of Culture would go a long way to
erasing image of violent divisiveness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LAWLESS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland
</DL>
<LD>The cities of Europe abound in cultural riches: the magic of Paris,
the glory of Rome, the glitter of London. But the wonder of Belfast?</LD>
<LD>   Northern Ireland's capital is most often associated with the long
sectarian strife of this British province, but city leaders think the
time is ripe for people to learn about Belfast's cultural life.</LD>
<LD>   It is bidding to become European Capital of Culture, an annual honor
previously bestowed on such continental gems as Paris, Florence and
Amsterdam.</LD>
<TE>   In 2008 the title will go to a city in the United Kingdom--and Belfast
ranks high in the betting among a dozen contenders that include the port
of Liverpool, the ancient university town of Oxford and the Welsh
capital, Cardiff.</TE>
<TE>   Belfast's bid reflects a renewed civic pride and a desire to forge an
identity beyond Northern Ireland's "troubles," which have killed more
than 3,000 people in the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say it will take more than an arts festival or two to heal a
scarred city still rent by deep divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's saying the bid will wipe the slate clean or wave a magic
wand," counters Sarah Hughes, spokeswoman for the City Council-backed
bid. "We're not being naive. We're looking at the bad as well as the
good."</TE>
<TE>   But, she adds, "we're trying to challenge preconceived ideas about
Belfast."</TE>
<TE>   There is an air of renewal in downtown Belfast, buoyed by the 1998
Good Friday peace accord and the Irish Republican Army cease-fire that
lifted the threat of bomb attacks and eased the tight security in the
city core.</TE>
<TE>   Decaying Victorian buildings are being converted into spiffy cafes,
and new developments are reviving the rundown docklands. Along the River
Lagan are the Waterfront Hall arts venue and the $140-million Odyssey
complex, which boasts a 7,000-seat sports arena, a children's science
center and an IMAX cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say Belfast has changed, become more like a normal city.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of international bands now include Belfast in their tours,"
says Tanya Mellotte, a concert promoter and member of the band Go
Commando. "And there are a lot more people here who want to have a career
in music, who think it is possible. There has always been a scene, but it
used to be more insular."</TE>
<TE>   The Capital of Culture title, which will be announced in March 2003,
would attract investment for new projects, along with media attention and
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Belfast officials take inspiration from previous titleholders. Their
city may not have the medieval streets of Bruges, Belgium, or the
stunning setting of Stockholm, Sweden, but it does have a lot in common
with the Scottish city of Glasgow, Europe's 1990 city of culture.</TE>
<TE>   Before its year of glory, Glasgow was a declining industrial city
known for grim Victorian slums and Catholic-Protestant tension. The year
allowed visitors--and Glaswegians--to rediscover the city's artistic and
architectural heritage, stimulated new businesses and gave the city
cachet as a hip travel destination.</TE>
<TE>   Belfast's backers admit they have a long way to go in raising the
profile of a city that, apart from "the Troubles," is best known as the
birthplace of the ill-fated Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   Belfast boasts a rich artistic heritage that includes writer C.S.
Lewis and singer Van Morrison among its natives.</TE>
<TE>   But past artists have tended either to move away--like Lewis and
Morrison--or to create work steeped in the pain and turmoil of the
Troubles.</TE>
<TE>   A vein of anger and regret runs through work by figures as diverse as
the poet Seamus Heaney, a Nobel literature laureate who taught at Queen's
University in the city and grappled with the Troubles in his book
"North"; and the punk band Stiff Little Fingers, which sang about wanting
an "Alternative Ulster."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the city's neighborhoods remain divided along religious lines.
"Peace walls" are still being constructed to keep warring neighbors
apart, and riots are common in the divided north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The city center is a much more relaxed place now," says Pauline
Hadaway, manager of a photography gallery, Belfast Exposed. "It's a
modern city, full of cafes and European-looking bars. But what happens
when that neutral center meets the still segregated--increasingly
segregated--neighborhoods?</TE>
<TE>   "Belfast has very specific problems, fundamental problems. Can it use
international models to regenerate? I think the city-of-culture bid is an
attempt to do it. I certainly wish them well."</TE>
<TE>   The team behind the city-of-culture bid says the "passions, paradoxes
and creative tensions" between Belfast's Catholic and Protestant
communities give the city a unique creative edge.</TE>
<TE>   "New York is a violent city too," wrote Malachi O'Doherty, a columnist
for the Belfast Telegraph. "Just because you have murder in the streets
doesn't mean you can't have soul-searching and creativity."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo Calls Halt to Activities After Receiving
Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Embassy shut down all operations Friday because of a
terrorist threat, just days after police raided an Islamic charity,
arrested an espionage suspect and seized bogus passports, weapons and
plans for making bombs, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The embassy in Sarajevo had reduced operations Wednesday after
receiving word of a possible terrorist threat. On Friday, it got new
information "that prompted us to take further precautionary measures and
close the embassy entirely," spokeswoman Karen Williams said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are reassessing the situation continually and will reopen when
appropriate," she said.</LD>
<TE>   No other details about the nature of the threat were made available by
the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bosnian police raided an Islamic charity, Bosnian Ideal
Future, formerly known as the Benevolentia International Foundation.
Police said some employees of the charity were conducting activities
unrelated to humanitarian work.</TE>
<TE>   Police reported Friday that they arrested a man with links to the
charity but gave only his initials, M.Z. They did not say when the arrest
was made but said the man was turned over to the investigative judge of
Sarajevo's regional court under "credible suspicion" of committing
espionage.</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomatic source in Sarajevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday's raid uncovered ski masks, forged passports,
loaded weapons and grenades, as well as instruction manuals for making
explosive devices and booby-traps.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Bosnia's government ordered an inquiry into the work of
foreign humanitarian agencies. Just two weeks ago, investigators reported
funds were missing from three Islamic charities, including the
Benevolentia International Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million Muslims live in Bosnia, including several hundred
Islamic fighters who came to fight on the Muslim side in the war against
the Serbs and Croats. About 3,100 U.S. troops are stationed in the
country with the NATO-led peacekeeping force.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SHIBERGAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum supervised the release of 250 prisoners
Friday under an amnesty granted in honor of the Persian New Year.</LD>
<LD>   The ethnic Pashtun prisoners, who have been held in an overcrowded
prison in Dostum's hometown in northern Afghanistan, were chosen for the
amnesty either because they were very young, very old or ill.</LD>
<LD>   Before the journey home, they were forced to sit in the pouring rain
for hours while being processed for release.</LD>
<TE>   The 3,000 prisoners in the prison 75 miles north of Mazar-i-Sharif
were detained four months ago by the Northern Alliance, accused of
collaborating with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Besmellah, 19, awaiting release in white plaster casts, both legs
splattered with mud, claimed that he was pressed into the Taliban's
service but didn't go into battle.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go home, first I'll wait to be healthy and then I'll work on
the farm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daweza, 80, admitted he had been a guard for the Taliban, but said: "I
never fought against the Northern Alliance--look, I'm an old man, I can't
fight."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the hundreds remaining--filling the prison to 10 times
capacity--is still unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The prison doctor said disease in the prison is rampant, ranging from
diarrhea to heart disease and kidney ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the prisoners flashed emaciated torsos as they changed their
shalwar kameez shirts while waiting in Red Cross lines before boarding
buses for home.</TE>
<TE>   The amnesty for this holiday is the second at the prison since the
Northern Alliance brought the detainees here in November; about 200 were
released for the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military interrogators have also questioned inmates at the
compound and took a few for further questioning to determine if they were
top Taliban figures or Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   Across the muddy courtyard where the prisoners were being registered,
Khalid Seffula lay unable to move in his sweat- and urine-stained
mattress in the makeshift prison clinic as flies buzzed around the
windowless room.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of the estimated 1,100 Pakistanis at the prison who came to
Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban--and not among those released.</TE>
<TE>   Seffula, 23, said he left his studies in Islamabad, Pakistan, and
arrived to fight two days after the American bombing campaign started in
October.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was there, I heard that Americans were attacking Muslims. When
I arrived here, I saw that was wrong--that Americans helped Muslims--but
after that I couldn't leave," he said, his left leg atrophied from disuse
after it was injured during fighting in Kunduz.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can't treat us, they should kill us here. We don't want to be
alive here," he said.</TE>

<HD>Community Helps Beloved Mosque Blossom Into a New Life</HD>
<DH>Egypt: After the roof collapsed, the prospects were dim. But
worshipers had faith in the rebuilding project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA BRYSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>After the roof of the Sam ibn Nuh mosque collapsed, the men and
women who worshiped there were determined to rebuild on a site where
Muslims have prayed for more than 1,000 years.</LD>
<LD>   The shopkeepers and peddlers who make up most of the congregation had
little money, though.</LD>
<LD>   And their mosque had little of the historic or artistic merit that
usually attracts preservationists. Although it stood on ground long held
as holy, it had been built in the 20th century and was barely
distinguishable from any of the other plain concrete mosques scattered
across Cairo.</LD>
<TE>   But the congregation had a friend: an Arabic-speaking Polish architect
working next door on the renovation of a 19th-century stone school and
charity house, known as a sabil, built by the founder of Egypt's last
royal dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   A partnership was born. The congregation of Sam ibn Nuh--Arabic for
Shem, son of Noah--got help from the architects and engineers gathered
from all over the world to restore the sabil of Mohammed Ali. After 17
months of fund-raising and construction, a gleaming new mosque opened
late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Agnieszka Dobrowolska, the architect in charge of the U.S.-financed
sabil project since 1998, said her relations with the neighborhood had
been warm from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   When she needed to photograph the sabil to document the start of work,
she had authority from the Egyptian Ministry of Culture to order
merchants to pull down stalls they had built against the monument's
walls. Instead, she politely asked, and the merchants politely agreed to
move long enough for the photographs to be taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I treated them as friends. We drank tea together," she said. "When
their mosque collapsed, they came to me because they thought I was the
only one who could help."</TE>
<TE>   The area where the mosque and sabil sat was shifting from rising
ground water. The experts renovating the sabil were quick to notice and
shore up walls and pillars. The congregation, though, knew nothing until
June 9, 1999, when the roof collapsed after evening prayers. Worshipers
had just left; no one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Dobrowolska said records show a succession of mosques had stood at the
site and been known as Sam ibn Nuh for at least 1,000 years. Neighborhood
legend says the Biblical patriarch's son is buried under the mosque, but
she said there is no tomb and it is unclear how the mosque got its name.</TE>
<TE>   For the rebuilding, Dobrowolska raised about $63,000 from the Dutch
government and from the Ford Foundation in New York. The architect, who
has helped restore Pharaonic, Roman, Christian and Muslim sites since
coming to Egypt in 1993, volunteered her time and expertise.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation raised extra money for lights and other fixtures,
volunteered to guard the site at night and helped carry construction
equipment during the day. They held prayers amid the debris throughout
the rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   If Dobrowolska's sabil was a historic monument, the mosque was a
living one. She had watched members of the congregation sleep, eat and
quarrel in Sam ibn Nuh. She saw one man die in the prayer hall, brought
to his beloved mosque by neighbors when he fell ill.</TE>
<TE>   On Fridays at noon, when the main Muslim prayer is held, Sam ibn Nuh
draws 600 to 700 worshipers, so many that some spill out onto the street.
Caretaker Mahmoud Mabrouk has a practical explanation for its popularity:
It's the only one in the neighborhood with an adjacent bath, where
Muslims can perform the ablutions required before prayer in relative
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Dobrowolska said practicality seemed to be the main impulse behind the
old mosque's design. But when she started by designing a series of
elegant arches to support a second-floor women's gallery, members of the
congregation asked eagerly that the rest of the new mosque have a similar
look.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what I did that was most important was that they started to
appreciate the beauty of architecture," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dobrowolska borrowed Islamic motifs from a number of places and
periods. The finished mosque, though not much bigger than a basketball
court, feels spacious under a gently sloping octagonal roof that seems to
float over a band of wooden grills that let in light and air.</TE>
<TE>   A row of arches is built of beige and white stone in a striped pattern
that looks both medieval and modern. Four marble columns topped by more
stone arches support the roof.</TE>
<TE>   It all sits on a foundation engineered to be independent of the

<HD>Russians' Influence Fades in Central Asia</HD>
<DH>Culture: New Muslim nations created by fall of Soviet Union have
only limited opportunities for the ethnic group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA CHARLTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TASHKENT, Uzbekistan
</DL>
<LD>The Soviet Union's demise a decade ago sent ethnic Russians
streaming out of Central Asia's steppes, leaving behind war, shriveling
salaries and neighbors suddenly resentful of their erstwhile colonizers.</LD>
<LD>   But many more quietly stayed behind. Some couldn't afford the journey
to Russia. Others saw little point in leaving these sunnier lands they
have called home all their lives for Russia's frigid expanse.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 3 million to 4 million ethnic Russians live among the 55
million people in the five young Muslim nations of Central Asia, some
anguished, some angry, some resigned, some resourceful. They are shaping
a new role for themselves, coming to terms with depleted influence and
security and the fading use of their native tongue.</LD>
<TE>   Irina Prokofieva tutored generations of children in Russian verbs and
Pushkin's poetry in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent. Her pension now is
the equivalent of just $4 a month. She has no known relatives in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   She has found a welcoming hearth in the city's Orthodox Church, where
she mops the marble floor, despite an ailing back, to supplement her
income, and frequents a Sunday school prohibited by the atheist Soviet
regime.</TE>
<TE>   In Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, three Russian women with Tajik
husbands gather some afternoons on a park bench to share financial woes
and debate how to school their bicultural children.</TE>
<TE>   Nationalists in Russia, panicked by their country's population decline
since the Soviet collapse, are urging that these ethnic Russians be
brought back "home." But the government has exhibited no interest in a
repatriation drive and little concern about the Russians who suddenly
found themselves "abroad" in newly independent nations.</TE>
<TE>   "We know not to expect anything from the Russian government. They
don't lift a finger," said Sergei Ezhkov, an outspoken Russian journalist
and activist in Uzbekistan who helped repatriate 5,000 fellow Russians in
the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Some politicians in Moscow want Russians to stay in Central Asia. They
fear the reduced Russian presence since 1991 has allowed the region to
slip out of Moscow's sphere of influence and into American hands.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's interest in the oil- and gas-rich region has led to aid
and NATO exercises in Central Asia in recent years. In a sign of shifting
allegiances, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan welcomed U.S. troops
for the military operation in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The countries' impoverished governments hope the decision will endear
them to Western investors. But Russian officials insist cooperation with
Russia is the only salvation for Central Asia's ailing economies.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is the key trade partner for Uzbekistan," said Dmitry
Ryurikov, Russia's ambassador in Uzbekistan. "That is the reality."</TE>
<TE>   The Russians were the last in a long line of colonizers of the desert
dunes that push east from the Caspian Sea into the towering Pamir
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Following Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, British agents and
czarist armies, Soviet planners drew today's borders and "Russified" the
countryside. More Russians arrived during mass deportations of political
and other prisoners under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   Ezhkov's ancestors came from Russia in 1874 to help build the region's
first railroad. A blue-eyed, fourth-generation Uzbekistan resident who
punctuates his speech with Uzbek phrases, he sees little reason to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Ezhkov is a muckraker and whistle-blower in a nation where criticizing
the president can earn you a jail term. "They say I'm discrediting the
country. But I'm doing it because I want to make the country better. It's
my country too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russians once ran most of Central Asia's media, universities and
factories. Fearing a backlash from native ethnic groups, an estimated 4
million have left since independence.</TE>
<TE>   The exodus had a debilitating effect on the five countries' economies,
and locals started urging the remaining Russians to stay.</TE>
<TE>   In Tajikistan, a five-year civil war and ensuing political chaos
hastened the Russians' departure--except for a 25,000-soldier Russian-led
force that guards the border with Afghanistan, which the Tajik government
is too destitute to patrol.</TE>
<TE>   In Kyrgyzstan, the government tried to force civil servants to take
Kyrgyz language exams. But acknowledging continued widespread Russian
use, Parliament passed a law in December reviving it as an official
language alongside Kyrgyz.</TE>
<TE>   Russians have retained some government posts in Kazakstan, which
shares a long border with Russia and where ethnic Kazaks form less than
half the multicultural population.</TE>
<TE>   Turkmenistan's population is heavily Turkmen, and its authoritarian
president's anti-foreigner policies and struggle with Moscow over Caspian
resources have alienated many ethnic Russians.</TE>
<TE>   In Uzbekistan, dozens of people still cluster daily in a
pothole-riddled residential area behind the Russian Embassy seeking
Russian citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are down from the early 1990s. But 42,000 people remain on
waiting lists for citizenship, said Ryurikov, the ambassador.</TE>

<HD>Non-Essential U.S. Embassy Staff in Pakistan Ordered Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The State Department on Friday ordered all but essential employees
at the U.S. Embassy and three consulates in Pakistan to return home, a
move that signaled serious concern with security in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The order was issued five days after an embassy employee and her
17-year-old daughter were killed along with three others in a grenade
attack on a Christian church in the diplomatic quarter of Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, traveling with President Bush in
Monterrey, Mexico, telephoned Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on
Friday to inform him of the decision, State Department spokesman Philip
T. Reeker said.</LD>
<TE>   Powell told Musharraf that the order didn't reflect a lack of
confidence in his government, its security force or Pakistan's commitment
to protecting Americans, Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the move underscores mounting worries that Americans
face a likelihood of future attacks in a country that has emerged as a
critical U.S. ally in the region but remains a political tinderbox.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sunday's attack, Reeker said, the department has been reviewing
security surrounding its diplomatic facilities in Pakistan as well as "a
continuous flow of threat information through intelligence channels."</TE>
<TE>   "The threats are such, the environment is such, that we can better
carry out our job by going to this status," Reeker said. Recent State
Department advisories had already warned U.S. travelers to avoid
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The department's facilities in Pakistan include the embassy in
Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. All four posts
will remain open and continue to serve travelers in the region, Reeker
said. But children and other dependents of State Department employees, as
well as workers whose jobs aren't critical, will be required to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Reeker declined to say how many department employees are in Pakistan
or how many people will be affected by the evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   The new order comes amid signs of mounting instability in Pakistan.
U.S. officials said last week that large numbers of Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters had fled into Pakistan from Afghanistan and might be trying to
regroup there to plot strikes on American targets and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stood atop the Khyber Pass and looked due south . . . you
could probably see most of the Taliban," said Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon indicated last week that it might have to launch military
operations inside Pakistan to hunt down members of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. And CIA Director George J. Tenet warned on Capitol Hill that
Musharraf continues to confront factions violently opposed to Pakistan's
alliance with the United States in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the March 17 strike, an unidentified attacker rushed into the
Protestant International Church and hurled at least three grenades into
the congregation. The church was just a quarter of a mile from the U.S.
Embassy, and among the dead were embassy personnel officer Barbara Green
and her daughter, Kristen Wormsley.</TE>
<TE>   Green's husband, Milton, who worked in the embassy's information
management office, was hospitalized. Their son, Zack, a fifth-grader, was
treated for minor injuries. They have since returned to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   One of those killed in the March 17 attack is believed to have been
the bomber, although his remains were obliterated and authorities were
still trying to determine his identity.</TE>
<TE>   Reeker said the evacuation would be "orderly" and likely take some
time to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the roof of the embassy in Saigon," he said, referring to
the dramatic scene near the end of the Vietnam War when U.S. diplomats
were airlifted out of South Vietnam.</TE>

<HD>Brazilians Now Developing a Love Affair With Tennis</HD>
<DH>Sports: Breakthrough of countryman Gustavo Kuerten into
international prominence has even poor youngsters taking to the courts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER MUELLO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil
</DL>
<LD>When Pele was a boy and too poor to buy a soccer ball, he'd make
one out of old socks tied together and hone his moves in pickup games.
The street was a crucible for the raw talent that helped make Brazil "the
land of soccer."</LD>
<LD>   A new kind of Pele is emerging from the streets and shantytowns, and
this one swings a racket.</LD>
<LD>   The rise of Gustavo Kuerten--"Guga" to Brazilians--to the top of the
tennis world has generated a wave of "Gugamania" in this country of 170
million. It also has inspired an unusual project called "Tenis Para
Todos," Portuguese for "Tennis for Everyone."</LD>
<TE>   Begun in 1999 by the Rio de Janeiro State Tennis Federation, the
project is taking tennis to poor communities, building public courts in
rural and inner-city districts and supplying free balls, rackets and
instructors.</TE>
<TE>   "Tennis today is no longer a sport of the elite," said Federation
President Helcio Ferreira da Silva. "We're reaching 2,000 poor kids, and
that's just the start."</TE>
<TE>   It's a daunting task. A gulf separates rich and poor in Brazil, where
many earn the minimum wage of $66 a month. And you can't make a tennis
ball out of old socks.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the closest tennis came to mass appeal was frescobol,
a Rio invention played on the beach with wooden paddles and a rubber
ball. It didn't help that Brazil had no top players since Maria Bueno,
years before television and the tennis boom of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But when Kuerten came along, everything changed. After he stunned the
tennis world by winning the French Open in 1997, waiting lines appeared
overnight at previously idle tennis courts as Brazilians belatedly caught
the tennis bug.</TE>
<TE>   "A new generation of Gugas is already on the way," da Silva said.
"Guga is doing his job. He's charismatic . . . and [he] has turned the
country on to tennis. But we have to do our part, otherwise he will
retire and tennis won't catch on."</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten, who spent much of the year at No. 1, was replaced by
Australian Lleyton Hewitt and finished the year at No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis already has caught on in Sao Sebastiao do Alto, a
once-prosperous coffee-growing center 130 miles northeast of Rio. Within
months after the town received the first two public courts under "Tennis
for Everyone," nearly one-tenth of the 3,000 residents had signed up for
tennis instruction, half of them children. Sao Sebastiao now has its own
tournaments--even its own ranking.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, they didn't even know a tennis ball had fuzz," Da Silva
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis also is hot in Rio's notorious Favela da Mare, or Tidewater
Slum, a complex of 16 shantytowns and about 150,000 residents on the edge
of Rio's Guanabara Bay. The federation built two courts in the Vila
Olimpica, a city-run sports complex deep in the favela.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, policemen with submachine guns stand an uneasy watch by a
ditch that separates the turf of warring drug gangs. But inside the
chain-link fence is a startling oasis of green fields, tracks and even a
pool, where about 2,500 neighborhood kids aged 4 to 17 come each week to
learn and play sports for free.</TE>
<TE>   When the tennis project opened in June, not even the instructors
thought the children would be interested. But today, about 250 kids a
week are taking lessons on the two concrete courts at the Vila Olimpica
and nearly 1,000 are on the waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   "The project was a surprise," said Marianina Impagliazzo, a project
organizer. "First, because it's an elite sport, we thought it wouldn't
catch on, that here it was soccer or nothing. But the kids saw there's
something beyond soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Would-be athletes in the favela face special hurdles. Poverty often
brings malnutrition. The drug gangs lure children away with the prospect
of easy money and discourage residents from crossing turf lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to seduce the children, bring them here and break the grip of
the drug traffickers," Impagliazzo said. Children must attend school to
come to Vila Olimpica, where they get free medical and nutritional care
and a snack that often substitutes for a meal.</TE>
<TE>   On the courts, they pound balls off a wooden backboard or trade
volleys under the eye of instructor Marcio Velasco, who divides his time
between the favela and the exclusive Barra Winner Tennis Club in Rio's
upscale Barra da Tijuca district.</TE>
<TE>   Each wears a yellow or blue Vila vest, but the footwear is a grab bag
of what's available or affordable. There are sneakers, clogs, rubber
sandals--and often nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   "For their world, they're coming along very well," Velasco said during
a break.</TE>
<TE>   One rising star is Debora da Costa, a 12-year-old who had never picked
up a racket until a year ago. In nine tournaments across Rio de Janeiro
state, she reached the semifinals every time and won once, rising to
fifth in the state ranking. Trophies and medals adorn a shelf at her
home, a one-bedroom shack she shares with her family in the Timbau Hill
district, the poorest in the favela.</TE>
<TE>   Her play drew the attention of a tennis club owner, who provides a
racket, gear bag, shoes and outfits for Debora to compete against rivals
with top-of-the-line equipment and years of private classes.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like we have money," she says quietly. "If people saw where
we lived. . . . " Her voice trails off.</TE>
<TE>   Although Debora dreams of being No. 1, her father has a more modest
vision. He knows she needs a coach, better food and conditioning if she
hopes to make a living from tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "My dream is for her to finish the eighth grade, go to high school,
graduate, maybe learn English," said Paulo Ferreira Costa, an unemployed
bus driver who separated from her mother when Debora was born.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis already has taken her further than either imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "The higher you climb, the greater the fall. She has to have her head
on straight," Costa said. "But she has a lot of luck, a lucky star. How
many families never get this chance?"</TE>

<HD>U.S. Deportees in Dire Straits in Haitian Prisons</HD>
<DH>Law: Some convicted of even minor crimes are sent to a country
where they've never set foot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ELSNER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government is trying its hardest to deport Gertha
Clairville to Haiti, a country she was not born in, has never lived in
and where she faces certain imprisonment and possible death.</LD>
<LD>   Clairville, 21, is one of hundreds, possibly thousands, of people
caught in a 1996 law aimed at U.S. residents who are not citizens. Some
have been convicted of relatively minor crimes, such as shoplifting and
check-kiting.</LD>
<LD>   Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act,
noncitizens convicted of a long list of violent or nonviolent offenses
can be automatically deported.</LD>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service hopes to deport Clairville
despite the fact that doing so will leave her three small children to
grow up without their mother, and knowing that she will be thrown into a
Haitian prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born in the Bahamas in 1980 and my parents, who were Haitian,
came to the United States when I was 1 year old," said Clairville,
interviewed in prison in Miami where she is awaiting a final decision on
her case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Clairville got into a fight with another woman and threatened
her with a knife. She was convicted of aggravated battery and sentenced
to two years in prison. When she had served her sentence, she was put on
a plane with 25 others and deported to Haiti, a country she had never
seen.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got there, the officials couldn't understand me and I couldn't
understand them. They took me to a jail in Port au Prince. I was there
for two months," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She was put in a cell with nine other women. They took turns sleeping
on a concrete floor with no blankets and bought their own food and water
since the prison did not supply any. A prison officer threatened to rape
her and only backed off when she screamed in terror.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrible. Why did they send me to a place where I wasn't even
born?" Clairville said.</TE>
<TE>   After two months, Clairville's lawyers from the Florida Immigration
Advocacy Center succeeded in having her returned to the United States.
She won an appeal to stay in the country in immigration court but the
authorities took the case to the Immigration Board of Appeals, which
ruled against her. Her lawyer is now trying to take the case to federal
court, but Clairville could be returned to Haiti at any time.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar case less than two years ago, Haitian-born Claudette
Etienne was convicted of selling a small amount of crack cocaine, an
offense that a U.S. judge did not think merited imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   But the INS deported her to Haiti, where she was imprisoned. Four days
later, after drinking contaminated water, she died.</TE>
<TE>   Her body lay unclaimed in a morgue a year later. Her husband,
struggling to bring up their two children, lacked the money to bring her
home and bury her.</TE>
<TE>   INS spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar said U.S. responsibility for the fate
of a deported person ends when the individual leaves U.S. soil. She said
the United States had deported 125 Haitians between October 2001 and
January 2002, of whom 77 had been classified as felons under the 1996
immigration law.</TE>
<TE>   "Our authority ends with the deportation. We do not have the ability
to dictate to a foreign government how to treat its own nationals," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about conditions in Haitian prisons, she said: "It would be a
good idea to visit a Haitian prison before making sweeping statements.
It's all hearsay."</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. State Department, in its past two human rights reports,
lambasted Haiti for its prisons and for jailing people indefinitely if
they are deported by other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Very poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and
prolonged pretrial detention continue to be problems. Many criminal
deportees who already served full sentences overseas are put back in jail
for indefinite periods of time," the department said in its 2001 report.</TE>
<TE>   Haitian authorities say that in a country with 85% unemployment,
criminal deportees have to be locked up to prevent them from resorting to
a life of crime.</TE>
<TE>   A BBC reporter, Andy Kershaw, visited a Haitian prison at Croix de
Bouquets in January 2002 and found windowless cells, "dark, fetid and hot
as a foundry." He saw 17 U.S. deportees in a cell that measured roughly
13 feet by 13 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Young of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children
said she found it astounding that the United States was deporting people
to Haiti, knowing what lay in store for them.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big question whether we are sending people back to torture
or even to their deaths. Is this what the United States wants to be
doing?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Clairville's three children, ages 6, 5 and 4, are being brought up by
their grandmother, who is in frail health. Clairville says the youngest
does not even know her.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my baby in jail. They took her away when she was 1 day old,"
she said. She fears that if the INS succeeds in deporting her to Haiti
once more, she will not survive to see her children again.</TE>

<HD>Hungarian Town at Odds on Communist Symbol</HD>
<DH>Politics: Red Star monument, an Iron Curtain remnant, is the focus
of a polarizing debate over its status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DOBOZ, Hungary
</DL>
<LD>The Red Star casts a long shadow over Doboz.</LD>
<LD>   Perched on a Soviet monument, it has split villagers more than a
decade after the end of communist rule in Hungary and catapulted their
remote community into national prominence.</LD>
<LD>   The issue of whether to topple the monument seems anachronistic 13
years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain and just a few years before
Hungary is to become one of the first of the former Soviet bloc nations
to join the European Union.</LD>
<TE>   In Budapest and other Hungarian cities teeming with German roadsters,
nouveau-riche stockbrokers and fashion-minded shoppers, the hammer and
sickle has long given way to the golden arches and roadside billboards
extolling Western consumer products.</TE>
<TE>   But Budapest is not Doboz, a community of simple houses, and of two
cafes crowded most mornings by pensioners, truck drivers and paprika
growers discussing local issues over their first beer of the day. Here,
the debate lives on, and in elemental terms.</TE>
<TE>   "To me the star represents the antichrist," said Countess Jeanne-Marie
Wenckheim-Dickens, who supports Protestant pastor Lajos Balogh-Barna in
his anti-monument crusade.</TE>
<TE>   For the other side, retiree Janos Gabor declared: "If we had a
referendum, the Red Star would stay, and the pastor would go."</TE>
<TE>   The main street--still called Red Army Boulevard--evokes times long
past, as does the roadside concrete monument raised to the Soviets, other
street names and a marble sign outside the mayor's office paying tribute
to a Hungarian communist luminary.</TE>
<TE>   Most Red Stars and other Soviet-era symbols were banned by Hungary's
first post-communist government in the early 1990s. Streets were renamed
elsewhere, but there was little change in Doboz--population 4,700--and
other eastern villages close to the Romanian border where economic hard
times feed nostalgia for communism's full employment and social welfare.</TE>
<TE>   While the Soviets are most remembered elsewhere in the country for
suppressing the anti-communist 1956 revolution, many in the east still
see them primarily as liberators from the Nazis--views that help
Socialist Mayor Janos Szatmari's campaign to keep the monument.</TE>
<TE>   Pedigree and origins also play a role: The mayor shares blue-collar
roots with most of the villagers and is a longtime Doboz resident.
Balogh-Barna, the anti-communist clergyman, arrived less than four years
ago and is linked by many villagers to the former "ruling class" swept
away by the communists.</TE>
<TE>   Customers leaning on the chipped counter at the Bisztro, one of the
village watering holes, were clear on their preferences. "We don't need
rabble-rousers like the pastor," declared trucker Janos Czifrak.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a black-clad widow who refused to identify herself said the
church "should be concerned with salvation and not whether the Red Star
stays or goes."</TE>
<TE>   In his office, the mayor displayed legal and government documents
backing his case--that the monument can stay because it commemorates
fallen soldiers rather than extols the communist system. He smiled
wearily when asked about the dispute, which has been the subject of a
state radio documentary and of more than a dozen national newspaper
articles.</TE>
<TE>   "When the system changed from communism to democracy, we asked the
people whether the monument should stay or not," Szatmari said. "The
majority voted to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few houses away, on the other side of the street, Balogh-Barna
said the mayor had hoodwinked the community in arguing that the
star-topped obelisk facing the village school was exempt from the
anti-symbol law.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also accuse the pastor of overcharging for religious services.
The round-faced, sad-eyed Balogh-Barna, who acknowledges sympathies with
the extreme rightist MIEP party, said he is being libeled by godless
"pagans" because he ended the past practice of ringing bells "for almost
free" at funerals for those who had never seen the inside of the church.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards away, Wenckheim-Dickens, whose late husband was a
descendant of Charles Dickens, serves coffee and cookies in the sitting
room of the tidily whitewashed Roman Catholic parish house she now calls
home. Displaying photos of herself with Britain's Princess Anne and
Margaret Thatcher, the countess said she wants to replace the Red Star
with a cross.</TE>
<TE>   She came back a little over two years ago to the village her family
fled more than a half-century before to escape the communists.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want me here because I represent democracy and freedom,"
she said. "The Lord said to me, 'Your time will come, after the mayor is
toppled.' I am here to help the people of the village find God again."</TE>

<HD>Egyptians Reject Jet Crash Report</HD>
<DH>Reaction: The U.S. conclusion that a co-pilot deliberately downed a
1999 flight is seen as biased or uninformed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A headline in Egypt's top newspaper Friday demonstrated how this
conservative Muslim nation is reacting to a U.S. report that an EgyptAir
co-pilot intentionally sent a passenger jet plummeting into the ocean in
1999: "American authorities intentionally withheld information and did
not solve the mystery of the crashed plane."</LD>
<LD>   That was what readers were served up in Al Ahram, the government-owned
daily, a day after the National Transportation Safety Board formally
announced that Egyptian co-pilot Gamil El Batouty deliberately downed the
plane, killing all 217 people on board.</LD>
<LD>   There was no mention here of NTSB conclusions that the plane's
mechanical and control systems were in working order, or that Batouty
disengaged the autopilot, or that he methodically plunged the plane into
the Atlantic Ocean off Massachusetts.</LD>
<TE>   Egyptians, instead, have fixated on "the leak": Shortly after the
plane went down, U.S. investigators leaked to the media their suspicion
that Batouty was responsible, in part because he was heard on the voice
data recorder saying, "Tawakalt" (I rely on God).</TE>
<TE>   Egyptians use this phrase routinely, and they immediately jumped on
the U.S. allegation as the result of religious bias or cultural
illiteracy. To this day, that view has framed the debate for the
government-owned airline, the government leadership and the family of the
accused.</TE>
<TE>   "The report is nonsense, nonsense," said Mohammed Nabil El Batouty,
the co-pilot's cousin. "It's a kind of evasion from liability to pay
insurance. Gamil was always a competent pilot--I mean, he wouldn't do
something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Coming at a time when many Egyptians are feeling misunderstood and
persecuted by the West as a result of the U.S.-led war on terrorism, the
case of the Egypt airliner seemed to exacerbate a sense of victimization
that has gripped this nation.</TE>
<TE>   From a neighborhood grocer to Egypt's top crash investigator, the U.S.
findings have been dismissed out of hand, much the way many people here
dismissed the videotape released by Washington that showed Osama bin
Laden acknowledging advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the Americans to reinvestigate the case, as they have not
considered several points presented by Egyptian investigators," including
proper checks on the plane's tail, cockpit voice recordings and radar and
flight-control data, said Mohsen El Messiri, head of Egypt's
investigating committee.</TE>
<TE>   EgyptAir Flight 990, bound for Cairo, took off from John F. Kennedy
International Airport on Oct. 31, 1999, about 1:20 a.m. Not long
afterward, the Boeing 767 plummeted 33,000 feet into the ocean. When
investigators recovered the two flight recording devices, they heard what
they considered to be the first evidence of wrongdoing: The plane was
flying normally when Batouty said, "I rely on God"--an invocation he
could be heard saying a total of 11 times on the cockpit voice recorder.</TE>
<TE>   Further physical evidence showed that Batouty then sent the jet into a
nose dive, while the pilot of the plane, Capt. Ahmed El Habashi,
struggled to save the flight. In a story published March 15 in The Times,
former EgyptAir Capt. Hanofy Taha Mahmoud Hamdy said the crash was a
vengeful act against EgyptAir executive Hatem Rushdy, who was seated in
first class when the plane went down. Taha--who is seeking asylum in
London--told The Times that a few hours before the flight, Rushdy had
reprimanded Batouty for alleged sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is swaying public opinion here, not among journalists,
academics, government officials or investigators. Egypt is desperate to
revive tourism, its No. 1 source of hard currency. After the Sept. 11
attacks, the tourist business dropped off sharply, and it has only just
begun to recover. The NTSB report isn't likely to bring tourists back,
especially on the national carrier.</TE>
<TE>   People here say they see a pattern in the U.S. approach--first
convicting someone, then finding the evidence to prove the conviction.
That's how many people here view the case against Bin Laden as well as
the one against the co-pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is in both cases there are similarities," said Emad
Shahin, a professor of political science at American University in Cairo.
"You name a suspect. Then you look for facts to prove it. That, of
course, is why people rejected this."</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the only reason Egyptians have trouble with the
findings. Virtually everything that happens here must be viewed through
the prism of the Muslim faith and relations with the Jewish community. As
a society, Egypt is devoted to Islam--and suspicious of Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide is a sin in Islam, and the person who kills himself is no
longer considered a Muslim. So it is difficult, if not impossible, for
people here to understand how Batouty, who had a sick daughter, would
have killed himself while calling on God to protect him. The fact that
the United States has come to this conclusion reinforces the belief among
some people that the Jewish community controls America's government.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible for someone to kill himself," said Mohammed Suleiman
Ibrahim, 67, a Cairo grocer. "Maybe the Jews influenced the report. There
is no problem between Egyptians and Americans. If they want to say
something incriminating, they should at least come up with something
logical enough to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Mohammed Mahmoud, 24, who said he serves in the military,
expressed a similar suspicion: "The problem is that there are people who
don't want the relations between the Americans [and the Egyptians] to be
good. Maybe Israel, I don't know. Our problem is that . . . Americans
don't know us. So they don't understand that Egyptian people are good and
don't do things like that."</TE>

<HD>Burned-Out Baby Boomers Trapped by 3 Little Words</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: When they start hating to get up in the morning, some
step out of the rat race. They reject the 'as soon as' syndrome and try
to find joy in the present.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Deep into the rat race but far from the finish line of retirement,
many baby boomers are at risk of hitting the career wall.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of toughing it out, some have joined different races--changing
their goals and their jobs. Survivors of burnout, their experiences might
inspire fellow boomers who fantasize about walking away from high-powered
jobs to find greater fulfillment elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Among the more unorthodox success stories, Jamie Sims went from urban
mortgage broker to crawfish farmer in rural Arkansas. And Dr. John
Mullen, veteran Dallas neurosurgeon, became a sheriff's deputy and
emergency room physician.</LD>
<TE>   Although such unlikely leaps might not be for everyone, the
54-year-old Mullen sees career adjustments as likelier in the wake of the
stock market's swoon and the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have come to the realization that money is not the
end-all," said Mullen, who, like Sims, made his career switch back in the
'90s. "Especially since Sept. 11, there's a new realization out there. I
just hope that attitude persists."</TE>
<TE>   Sims, 41, burned out early. After majoring in business at Louisiana
State University and becoming a mortgage broker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
she felt trapped by the time she hit her early 30s, weighed down by
fatigue, frustration, stress, even road rage.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked day and night. I was on call 24 hours a day. There was never
vacation time because if I took off, someone else would try to take my
area," she said. "I didn't like it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   So she ditched her job and her husband and moved back to Harrisburg,
Ark., where her parents sold crawfish that they brought back from trips
to Louisiana. Soon she owned and ran P&amp;J Fish Co. with her mother, Pat, a
former real estate appraiser.</TE>
<TE>   "I went from high heels to hip boots," she said. "If that's not a
transition, I don't know what is."</TE>
<TE>   It still requires a seven-day work week, at least from January to
July, and her income is a third of what it was. But Jamie has found her
calling. She and her mom sell a half-million pounds of crawfish a year,
raised from 30 acres of ponds, and her financial burden is eased by a low
cost of living in an area where she says $50,000 still buys a nice house.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go back for any amount of money," she said. "I'm outside
most of the time. I deal with a lot of people. I've had to re-educate
myself in so many ways, and I enjoy the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Put simply: "I'm a lot happier than I was."</TE>
<TE>   Too many of the nation's 76 million boomers, now ages 37 to 56, have
given up seeking that kind of satisfaction, according to Atlanta
consultant Jim Bird, citing millionaire clients who are unhappy with
their situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Boomers are so caught up in the 'as soon as' trap--'as soon as my
kids get through college,' 'as soon as I get this or that taken care
of'--that we're putting off the everyday enjoyment of life," said Bird,
president of the firm Worklifebalance.com. "The solution to burnout is to
realize we're very caught up in achieving and we should try to enjoy
something at work every day."</TE>
<TE>   Mullen does that now, at several jobs. Bored and burned out after 20
years as a neurosurgeon, he left his thriving medical practice in search
of a new direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 24/7 job and it just got old," he said. "When you hate to
get up in the morning and do something you loved to do, that's burnout. I
just got tired of it."</TE>
<TE>   But not tired overall. Mullen believes in second careers, and third
and fourth and fifth. While working regular shifts in a hospital ER--he,
too, makes a third what he used to--he pursued a love of law enforcement
by working as an unpaid sheriff's deputy for Franklin County north of
Dallas on his days off. He does forensic consulting for police
departments in homicide investigations, teaches at a police academy and
serves on a special forces team in the Army reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what advice he would give fellow burned-out boomers, Mullen,
preparing to start a 12-hour overnight shift in the emergency room at
Titus County Regional Medical Center, didn't hesitate. "Do what you
enjoy--the hell with the money."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Shipper, professor of management at Salisbury University in
Maryland, says many baby boomers are feeling squeezed by age and economic
pressures that have suddenly shrunk their options for advancement.</TE>
<TE>   "The option that some people are choosing is to get out of the
corporate or structured life and into more entrepreneurial things," he
said. "Whether it's getting into a bed and breakfast or starting a
business on their own, people are starting nontraditional careers.</TE>

<HD>Hackers Targeting Cell Phones</HD>
<DH>Security: Damaging viruses can wreak havoc with unsuspecting users,
experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>For malicious computer hackers and virus writers, the next frontier
in mischief is the mobile phone.</LD>
<LD>   A phone virus or "Trojan horse" program might instruct your phone to
do extraordinary things, computer security experts say.</LD>
<LD>   It might call the White House or the police with a bizarre hoax.</LD>
<TE>   It might forward your personal address book to a sleazy telemarketing
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Or it could simply eat into the phone's operating software, shutting
it down and erasing your personal information.</TE>
<TE>   Similar nasty tricks have already dogged cell phone owners in Japan
and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "If a malicious piece of code gets control of your phone, it can do
everything you can do," said Ari Hypponen, chief technical officer of
Helsinki-based F-Secure Corp., a computer security firm. "It can call
toll numbers. It can get your messages and send them elsewhere. It can
record your passwords."</TE>
<TE>   As cellular phones morph into computer-like "smart phones" able to
surf the Web, send e-mail and download software, they're prone to the
same tribulations that have waylaid computers over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We should think of cell phones as just another set of computers on
the Internet," said Stephen Trilling, director of research at anti-virus
software maker Symantec Corp. "If they're connected to the Internet they
can be used to transmit threats and attack targets, just as any computer
can. It's technically possible right now."</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, deviant e-mail messages sent to cell phones contained an
Internet link that, when clicked, caused phones to repeatedly dial the
national emergency number--equivalent to 911. The wireless carrier halted
all emergency calls until the bug was removed.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, handsets' short message service, or SMS, has been used to
randomly send pieces of binary code that crashes phones, forcing the user
to detach the battery and re-boot. A new, more sinister version keeps
crashing the phone until the SMS message is deleted from the carrier's
server.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, relatively primitive cell phone technology keeps
users immune from such tricks, for now.</TE>
<TE>   Phone hacking is nothing new. In the 1970s, so-called "phone
phreakers" made free phone calls--and even gained control of major phone
trunk lines--by whistling certain tones into the receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "It was easy," said John Draper, 58, of Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Draper, now a designer of computer security software, is still known
as Captain Crunch for pioneering the hacking of phone networks with the
help of a plastic whistle that came in a box of the eponymous breakfast
cereal.</TE>
<TE>   "You could control the entire network, do anything an operator could
do," Draper said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at least three software companies have released personal security
software for emerging smart phones, girding for a new wave of phone
viruses and Captain Crunch-style tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Hypponen's F-Secure is one such firm, selling anti-virus and
encryption software for smart phone operating systems made by Palm,
Microsoft and the Symbian platform common in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, there have been no publicized reports of phone hacking or
viruses, although viruses have attacked hand-helds running the Palm
operating system. Microsoft predicts deviant code will soon emerge for
hand-helds running its Pocket PC software. Both operating systems are
expected to be used increasingly in smart phones.</TE>
<TE>   A virus is a piece of malevolent code that self-replicates, while a
Trojan horse does not but can be just as destructive. The pranks in
Europe and Japan created virus-like havoc, but did not propagate like a
full-fledged virus.</TE>
<TE>   For virus writers who crave notoriety by wreaking maximum havoc, there
are still too few smart phones, and no widespread software platform to
attack, Hypponen said.</TE>
<TE>   That is starting to change.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, cell phone operating systems were "closed," unable to
download software. But new smart phones--like the Nokia Communicator,
Handspring's Treo, Motorola's Java Phone and Mitsubishi's
Trium-Mondo--are open to such third-party downloads.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, software developers' tools available for designers
of such programs as games and currency converters can also be used to
create malicious applications, Hypponen said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible for anyone to make custom software for this platform,"
he said. "Teens can download development tools and write their own
software."</TE>
<TE>   It's these third-party programs that worry experts. If one is
disguised as a Trojan horse, an infected phone could make some calls on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, mobile phone owners will be obliged to install security software
like "personal firewalls" that used to be reserved for Internet servers,
said Prakash Panjwani, a senior vice president at Certicom Corp., a
computer security firm in Hayward, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone users can avoid this, of course, by sticking with their old
"dumb" phones, said Alan Reiter, a wireless consultant in Chevy Chase,
Md.</TE>
<TE>   "There are trade-offs," said Reiter. "Do you want a phone with a tiny
monochrome screen where you can only make phone calls? That's much more
secure."</TE>

<HD>Cracks Showing in Venerable Plymouth Rock Legend</HD>
<DH>History: The landmark's claim to America's founding crumbles upon
closer scrutiny, but it remains a solid tourist attraction.</DH>

<DL>PLYMOUTH, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>An ancient, icy Atlantic wind churns Plymouth Harbor, the sky
spreads a slate gloom, and some teenagers stare solemnly at a boulder
caged in a sand pit, like a circus act.</LD>
<LD>   The year "1620" is carved in its flank. A fat seam of mortar fills a
diagonal crack. A marker for modern pilgrims identifies this pale, plump
chunk of granite--just six feet across--as Plymouth Rock.</LD>
<LD>   "Tradition tells us that the Pilgrims stepped upon this rock when they
arrived in Plymouth in December of 1620," drones the sign at Pilgrim
Memorial State Park.</LD>
<TE>   But Matt Souza of nearby Lakeville, a teenager with a baseball cap and
pierced ear, heard it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard it came from a quarry in Quincy. My dad supposedly knows the
guy that moved it. That's how it got cracked," he says, seemingly in
earnest.</TE>
<TE>   The sign's version may be only slightly less cracked.</TE>
<TE>   Most historians have concluded that the widely accepted story of the
rock is likely a crock, a rousing myth first fanned by Revolutionary War
passions and later by New England's regional superiority complex. Scholar
John Seelye, who wrote the 1998 study "Memory's Nation: The Place of
Plymouth Rock," says it stands at the center of "what amounts to an
ongoing hoax."</TE>
<TE>   Blarney or not, this stone and its story hold a lode of truth about
conflicts in the national character: strong ideals and fast deals, faith
and pragmatism, gullibility and guile. In the world after Sept. 11, when
patriotic symbols gleam with new luster, Plymouth Rock is a place worth
revisiting.</TE>
<TE>   We all know the story: In the winter of 1620, the bedraggled Pilgrims
from the Mayflower, rebuffing the Church of England, spilled from their
scouting boat onto Plymouth Rock--a sort of welcome-to-America mat. They
stopped there and struck noble or prayerful poses for the benefit of
unborn illustrators. Then they set out to father a country.</TE>
<TE>   The truth? Well, to start with, both Pilgrims and Rock were there.
Geologists believe the boulder was deposited by a glacier about 30,000
years ago. The Pilgrims built their first homes just up the hill from the
rock. But William Bradford, their chief chronicler, later wrote that they
simply "marched into ye land."</TE>
<TE>   Not a word survives about ye rock until nearly a century later. In
1715, a town surveying record takes note of this boulder, the hulk of the
beach. But it mentions it simply as a rock--not "the" rock.</TE>
<TE>   Born in local oral tradition, the story of the rock only catches on
more broadly decades later, as the colonists contemplate a split from
England. They start to build their new identity on a rock.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a ready-made symbol," says Robert Arner, a University
of Cincinnati professor who has written about colonial America. "It never
was about a stone as stone. Otherwise, they would have blown it out of
the way to make room for a wharf."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there was a plan for a wharf around 1741. Fearing that a
certain boulder would be buried underneath, Thomas Faunce, a 95-year-old
church elder who had been town clerk, wanted to be carried down to the
beach on a chair for one last look.</TE>
<TE>   The tearful old man told how his father, who arrived in Plymouth three
years after the Mayflower, had spoken of this rock as the place where the
forefathers first stepped onto the new homeland. His father wanted it
"perpetuated to posterity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The locals were moved, and the rock wasn't. (Years later, a dock was
finally erected--but around the rock.)</TE>
<TE>   As early as the 1770s, there are a few surviving references to the
legend of the rock, including a news story and a map with a note written
by a Pilgrim's great-great grandson. But it is largely thanks to
Faunce--or the story of his day at the beach--that the hulk became known
as Forefathers' Rock and, later, Plymouth Rock.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, the Faunce story survives mainly through James
Thacher's 1832 "History of Plymouth." Thacher had been a surgeon with a
colonial detachment in the Revolution, more than 150 years after the
landing. But he says he heard the Faunce story from church deacon Ephraim
Spooner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost comical anyone would have believed it," says Richard
Shenkman, who writes about historical fictions and edits an online
history magazine at George Mason University.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. By 1774, townsfolk, swept up in anti-English fury, decided
the rock deserved better treatment, as Thacher tells it. With the help of
about 60 oxen, they set out to lug the rock to a place of honor in Town
Square beside a liberty pole, a hub for revolutionary activity.</TE>
<TE>   They jacked it up, tried to heave it into a carriage,
and--oopsies!--the darn thing cracked in two. Oh well, maybe it was a
good omen for a breakaway war. Besides, it was now a whole lot easier to
drag up the hill. The base was left on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   With the legend spreading, souvenir hunters started chipping off
pieces from both the top and bottom parts of the estranged rock. "Its
very dust is shared as a relic," wrote Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in
1835.</TE>
<TE>   Nature writer Henry David Thoreau was offered a memento but declined.
Others delighted in the offer. The rock turned into paperweights,
cornerstones, at least one door step, filling for a concrete floor,
family heirlooms. Finally, guards were posted.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got thrifty Yankees. If you got some damn fool tourist who
wants to give you $1.50 for it, you take it," says Peggy Baker, director
of Plymouth's Pilgrim Hall Museum. The museum displays its own slab.</TE>
<TE>   The top part of the rock was finally enclosed in an iron fence and
eventually reunited with the boulder's bottom at the shore beneath a
granite canopy. For the 300th anniversary of the landing, the National
Society of Colonial Dames of America erected a Parthenon-style portico
over the rock.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several decades, its legend has been increasingly eclipsed
by the story--also a mixture of fact and fancy--of the Thanksgiving feast
between the Pilgrims and their Wampanoag neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "Now where does the rock come in? It doesn't," says Mayflower
descendant Jim Baker, a Plymouth historian and husband of the museum
director. (Actually, American Indians have poured paint or dumped sand on
it during Thanksgiving protests starting in the 1960s, after which it was
cleaned up.)</TE>
<TE>   What remains of the rock is estimated to weigh about six tons. High
tides still slosh over it, exposing it to more natural damage on top of
centuries of a nation's hard love.</TE>
<TE>   But the rock is still tended like a beloved, if out-of-step,
great-grandparent. It is periodically waterproofed, its cracks mortared.</TE>
<TE>   It's still a buttress for local tourism in what is promoted as
America's hometown. (Never mind that English people settled 13 years
earlier down in Jamestown, in the Virginia colony.)</TE>
<TE>   You can visit the rock for free at any hour, even if more profitable
attractions await just down Water Street, like whale watching and a
reenacted pirate adventure. If you really do like history, the
role-playing characters at Plimouth Plantation (which uses the old
spelling) will interact with you.</TE>
<TE>   The rock says and does nothing, yet an estimated 800,000 people a year
still come from the far ends of this super-sized nation, and beyond, to
take a look.</TE>
<TE>   Many are disappointed. "I should have known it was just a rock,"
griped college administrator Peter Dolce, a visitor from Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, many return again and again, even in the kind of weather that
killed dozens of Pilgrims the first winter. "It's just something you
always do; you just come here," said Evan Mazetis, another in the group
of teenagers stopping by the beach in winter.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilgrims chose this spot for its protected harbor and flat, safe
shoreline. Given a choice, they would probably have avoided Plymouth Rock
as a hazard to their wooden boats, Seelye suggests.</TE>
<TE>   But the legend and its followers endure. Ruth B. Walker, 83, a
Plymouth native who acts as a state-park interpreter of the rock, says
the Pilgrims probably stepped on it to keep their feet dry in that cold,
wet winter.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have made good sense," she says. That's argument enough for
many New Englanders--and many other Americans.</TE>

<HD>Students May Be Able to Bargain for College Aid</HD>
<DH>Education: Some are surprised to learn that schools are willing to
boost scholarship packages in special situations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARLENE LEVINSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When John Davin got acceptance letters from seven colleges, he
weighed their financial aid offers and then asked his top two choices if
they could do better.</LD>
<LD>   They could, and Davin saved nearly $6,000 his first year.</LD>
<LD>   Now 20 and a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh--which
famously welcomes a chance to reconsider its aid packages--Davin echoes
advice often heard these days from guidance counselors, consultants and
even some college officials: Don't be shy about asking a school to
improve its financial aid offer if you think you have a good case.</LD>
<TE>   "Go for it," Davin said. "You don't have anything to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Usually it is the private, less competitive schools that entertain
such appeals.</TE>
<TE>   But Davin was offered more money from two of the best when he wrote to
Cornell and Carnegie Mellon, citing a generous scholarship dangled by his
third-choice school, his family's high property taxes in suburban East
Northport, N.Y., and his three younger sisters headed for college.</TE>
<TE>   For his freshman year, Carnegie Mellon nearly doubled its initial
offer of a $6,000 grant.</TE>
<TE>   This academic year, the university boosted its aid even more because
Davin's eldest sister is in college too. Davin and his parents are
spending under $10,000 at Carnegie Mellon this year, less than a third of
the estimated $35,700 cost of tuition, living expenses and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   How many students and families ask for and get an improved financial
aid offer is not tracked, but the number is probably small.</TE>
<TE>   As colleges start sending acceptance letters this month, they will
soon learn whether the tough economy prompts more parents to ask for
better financial aid packages.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are most receptive to such pleas if there has been a sudden
and drastic change in family circumstances since the financial aid
questionnaire was completed, such as a parent losing a job.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Victor, a school bus driver, was ready go deep into debt to put
her son, Jesse, through college. The 54-year-old single parent from South
Salem, N.Y., makes under $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Victor was thrilled last year when the University of Rochester offered
a mix of scholarships, grants and loans. It meant she would borrow around
$12,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Then Jesse won a $5,000 prize from his high school. Sometimes colleges
subtract such gifts from aid they offer, but instead Victor was able to
apply that money to reduce her borrowing to just under $7,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Colleges are out there that help in the process," she said. "Just
reach out to whatever avenue is available."</TE>
<TE>   College financial aid officers recoil from words like "negotiate" and
"bargain" to describe the process. They prefer "appeal," "adjust" or
"reevaluate."</TE>
<TE>   And financial aid officers generally do not encourage families to
angle for more money, said Dallas Martin, president of the National Assn.
of Student Financial Aid Administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people feel a lot of the families that are doing that, are
treating it like they're shopping for a new car," Martin said. "We would
hope they're looking at what is the best educational opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Mellon is the rare school that invites those they accept to
submit offers from other schools, to see if Carnegie Mellon might improve
its package.</TE>
<TE>   This helps Carnegie Mellon track aid at its rivals, said Michael
Steidel, admissions director.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't try to match. We don't try to beat them," Steidel said. "We
just try to close the gap."</TE>
<TE>   Of those admitted for the Carnegie Mellon freshman class that entered
this past fall, 673 asked the school to reconsider its aid offer and 314
succeeded. Of the latter, 171 enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Guidance counselors and private advisors suggest a diplomatic
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Denver education consultant Steven Antonoff said parents might call
the school and say: "I don't want to barter with you. I am merely
calling. We are fairly affluent, but we are not made of money. Biff wants
to go to your place more than he does this other place and the difference
in aid packages is. . . . "</TE>

<HD>Wax Museum Brings Ghastly Slavery Issues to Life for Uninitiated</HD>
<DH>History: Cruel images stand alongside modern-day heroes in the
hopes that a better understanding can result.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAIME HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE
</DL>
<LD>The girls stood silent as they stared at a bloody picture of a
black man whose hands were chopped off by a former slave owner during
Reconstruction.</LD>
<LD>   They muttered to themselves, trying to understand how so harsh an act
could have been carried out. After several minutes, 8-year-old Janae
Thompson turned to her friend April Walker to offer a conclusion:</LD>
<LD>   "They're not supposed to do that to people, whether they're black or
white."</LD>
<TE>   It's exactly the message Joanne Martin wanted to convey when she and
her late husband, Elmer, opened the Great Blacks in Wax Museum in 1983.
Only later would she learn that teenagers, black and white, weren't even
aware that blacks were once lynched for simply walking on the sidewalk
with a white.</TE>
<TE>   "This museum is designed to give them some kind of context for their
life today and what the struggles of the past have to do with that," she
said. "The museum adds a visual impact to history. If you put a wax
figure across the room, people will gravitate toward it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 life-size, authentically dressed wax statues are on
display. Famous blacks such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Frederick
Douglass and Marcus Garvey. There are wax figures of such ancient
notables as Hannibal, the pharaoh Akhenaten and the priest-physician
Imhotep of Egypt--people who represented the struggle and power of
blacks.</TE>
<TE>   King's statue is dressed in a dark suit and tie. A three-figure
display featuring Jackie Robinson, Joe Louis and Jesse Owens has Robinson
in a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, Louis in boxing trunks and Owens in a blue
track suit with gold medals hanging around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin Powell and Rosa Parks, who have visited the
museum, are immortalized in wax.</TE>
<TE>A Group Effort</TE>
<TE>   A network of contractors sculpt, color and make hair for the figures.
Some have wax heads and hands attached to mannequin bodies; others are
complete wax statues.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the clothing was donated. Former New York Rep. Shirley
Chisholm, the first black congresswoman, contributed clothing for a
costume and the Army gave a uniform for the Powell statue.</TE>
<TE>   Each figure takes about five months to construct, a process Martin
said is worth the time because in some cases, the figure is modeled after
someone still living. The cost of each statue ranges from $9,000 to
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   A large replica of a nameless slave ship greets patrons entering the
building, and children are encouraged to walk around the vessel and view
pictures of slaves being brought to America in colonial times. One
painting shows a slave wrapped in chains hanging off the side of a ship,
his hand bitten off by sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to look at the contradiction of a slave ship named
Friendship or Holy Mary or John the Baptist," Martin said. "These were
death ships where cruelty and heinous crimes took place. There was that
idea that it negated all that through the names [of the ships]."</TE>
<TE>Plumbing the Depths</TE>
<TE>   The replicas on the bottom floor, which is dedicated to lynchings, are
disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   On display in a clear plastic box is a mannequin of a pregnant black
woman hanging by a rope wrapped around the neck. The abdomen is cut open.</TE>
<TE>   Across the room is a wall with pictures of white men standing next to
dead black men hanging from trees. Below them are jars containing
replicas of body parts cut from blacks along with an explanation that the
hands, arms, legs and genitals were "prizes" for racists who carried out
such atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   The section also has a small hallway with graffiti spray painted over
a brick wall and gang members with guns.</TE>
<TE>   A list of 5,000 blacks lynched in the United States between the 1880s
and 1930s is posted above the room's entrance. It is based on the book
"100 Years of Lynching" by Ralph Ginzburg, as well as three years of
research by Martin's husband in the records of the NAACP, Tuskegee
University and Xavier University of Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said it is difficult to pinpoint the number of lynching
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of it was secret," she said. "People just disappeared or were
missing under unknown circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   That exhibit was unveiled, she said, after teenagers told her they
didn't know blacks were once victims of lynchings.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you going to convince those kids that a struggle took place?"
she asked. "Walking on a sidewalk with a white person could have gotten
you killed. They [youths] should be thankful for enjoying the freedoms
that they enjoy today."</TE>
<TE>   With such graphic and disturbing images, Martin said teachers and
parents must decide whether to allow young children into the room.</TE>
<TE>   The Martins began touring schools, churches, shopping malls and other
places in 1980, using four wax statues bought with money they had saved
to buy a house. Their goal was to teach people about black history.</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Martin was a faculty member in the department of social work and
mental health at Morgan State University. His wife once ran the tutoring
program at Coppin State University, but resigned eight years ago to work
full time at the museum.</TE>
<TE>   By 1983, the couple had opened a small museum with 21 wax figures.</TE>
<TE>   The museum gained popularity and eventually the Martins won federal,
state and local grants to help them expand. Running primarily on
donations, fund-raisers and admission fees, the museum is now in a
30,000-square-foot complex that used to be a firehouse, a Victorian
mansion and a duplex.</TE>
<TE>   Martin works closely with the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We, as adults, have to put more emphasis on trying to get our young
people to the museum," said G.I. Johnson, president of the Baltimore
branch of the NAACP. "There are things that they will witness that will
help our children understand our history."</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Martin died last year while he and his wife were in Egypt for a
research project. His spirit, however, lives on with the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband said we had to stop and ask, 'What happened?' and that
slogans don't do it--they can only go so far," Joanne Martin said. "You
have to build institutions, set up to preserve history. Otherwise, every
generation would have to start over from scratch."</TE>

<HD>Hardy Potato Blight Strain Still Raising Ire of World's Farmers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: An offshoot of the malady that crippled Great Britain
150 years ago has adapted to thwart eradication efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GUY GUGLIOTTA</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scourge began in the late summer of 1845, with a spate of
unseasonably cool weather and weeks of fog and rain leading into the
fall. Lesions began to appear on the leaves of the potato plants, and a
fluffy fungus traveled down the stems, carried by rainwater until it
reached the tubers beneath the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Within days, the plants were dead--shriveled to a few tiny tendrils of
greasy black slime--but that was just the beginning. In the ensuing
years, the Irish Potato Famine killed a million people and caused more
than a million others to emigrate, most of them to the United States.
Pre-famine Ireland had 8 million people. Post-famine, it has never had
more than 4 million.</LD>
<LD>   For 150 years, the famine has been a source of enduring rancor between
the Irish and their then-masters from Britain. It has also been the
source of one of the all-consuming mysteries of plant pathology,
confounding scientists.</LD>
<TE>   In many ways, the pathogen called Phytophthora infestans, or potato
late blight fungus, is even more dangerous now than it was the year it
made its apocalyptic debut. Thumbing its nose at modern science, it
remains today the most pernicious and persistent plant disease on Earth.
In the developing world alone, the blight causes $2.75 billion in crop
losses a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been pandemic for 150 years," said Canadian government potato
pathologist Harold Platt, chairman of the International Potato Center's
Global Initiative on Late Blight. "It is the most aggressive plant
disease we have, without question."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the fungus has proved so hardy and so adaptable that
scientists have never found an herbicide to which it cannot adjust, or a
species of potato--including those that are genetically engineered--whose
defenses it cannot breach. Any cure that scientists find lasts for five
years at most before the blight mutates to overcome it. Sometimes the
pathogen can adjust "in a single growing season," Platt said.</TE>
<TE>   It was partly for this reason that North Carolina State University
epidemiologist Jean B. Ristaino decided to revisit the famine in an
attempt to determine the origin of the late blight fungus: "You find out
where it's from, and you're likely to find varieties of potatoes that are
most resistant to it," Ristaino said. "Understanding the source has
always been a key question."</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing theory held that the most prevalent kind of modern
blight, a variety called US-1 that reproduces asexually by cloning
itself, was a direct descendant of the famine pathogen and probably came
from Mexico's high-altitude Toluca Valley, about an hour's drive from
Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   But in research reported last summer in the journal Nature, Ristaino
described how she and a team of researchers had conducted genetic tests
of pathogens taken from famine-era potato leaves stored in Britain's
Royal Botanic Gardens. Those pathogens did not match US-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ristaino suspected the famine blight may have come from somewhere
else, and in a report being prepared for publication later this year, the
team will suggest that it matches a pathogen found both in Mexico and
South America. So the search will continue.</TE>
<TE>   Ristaino says she leans toward an "out of the Andes" theory, because
the cradle of world potato cultivation lies in the high valleys and
windblown moors of what are today the mountain cordillera countries of
Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, native
Americans had been growing potatoes for nearly 8,000 years, and
cultivation had traveled north and south along the ribbed highlands of
the continental divide.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of pre-Columbian blight outbreaks is sparse, and when the
Spaniards took the potato to Europe it was grown without serious disease
for more than three centuries, becoming a staple ingredient in foods as
diverse as shepherd's pie, Russian vodka and the Hanukkah latkes of
European Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "As civilizations grew, certain types [of potatoes] were recognized as
good food sources, and those were emphasized," Platt said. Farmers went
to clonal production of the most edible varieties--cutting up potatoes
from one crop and using them as seed stock for the next. This practice,
the cornerstone of potato production even today, "created a haven for
late blight," Platt said.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-19th century, Ireland was cultivating potatoes in two ways.
Peasant farmers were nursing small plots for family and local use, and
British landlords used large farms to produce for larger markets. The
most popular potato at the time was a knobbed variety known as the
"lumper," Ristaino said, "the perfect shape for trapping the pathogen."</TE>
<TE>   Late blight arrived in Europe in July 1845, probably traveling on a
shipment of Mexican potatoes imported after several years of bad European
harvests, Ristaino said. Within weeks, the blight had hopped through
potato fields in Flanders and other lowland producing areas. Then it
jumped to Ireland, where it rampaged through a land where potatoes had
been unknown only three centuries earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The study of P. infestans began almost as soon as it was pinpointed by
British clergyman Miles Berkeley as the cause of the blight, but early
identification has not helped cure the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Science has added sophistication. Herbicides, both prophylactic sprays
and systemic substances that enter the plant itself, have had success.
So, too, have selective breeding and genetic engineering for resistant
potato strains.</TE>
<TE>   But the pathogen always catches up: "With all the advances in modern
agriculture, it has been able to adapt to all the chemical and host
resistance we put out there," Platt said. "When it has the opportunity,
it will make changes around the world to ensure its survival."</TE>
<TE>   Famine-era blight can still be found everywhere, Ristaino said, but
150 years after its arrival, scientists still don't know where it came
from. If they did, they might learn how to stop it.</TE>

<HD>A Colorful Outlook Stirs the Senses</HD>
<DH>Science: Some estimate that one in 25,000 people are living with a
condition known as synesthesia, in which words and numbers take on
various hues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RECER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For one middle-aged man, "two" looks blue, but "2" is orange. And
while "3" appears pink, "5" is green.</LD>
<LD>   The man has synesthesia--a phenomenon in which printed words and
numbers burst with color, flavors take on shapes and the spoken language
turns into a mental rainbow.</LD>
<LD>   For some people with synesthesia, say researchers, a newspaper is
never black and white--it's red, orange, blue, beige, pink and green all
over.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an alternate perception," said Thomas J. Palmeri, a
Vanderbilt University psychologist and the first author of a study
reporting on the tests given to one man. "He is normal--a highly
successful, intelligent man and he suffers no problems from this unique
wiring of the brain."</TE>
<TE>   The study, which appeared last week in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, explores the multichromatic world of a man
identified only as W.O. The man, a university professor of medicine, did
not respond to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeri said researchers are starting to realize that W.O. is just one
of a large number of people with synesthesia, many of whom take joy in
this rich symphony of sensations.</TE>
<TE>   "They often experience a great deal of pleasure from this altered
perception," said Edward M. Hubbard, a synesthesia researcher at UC San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   For W.O., his synesthesia helped make learning the complex words of
science easy--when the colors weren't distracting him from study, Palmeri
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees a palette of different colors when he reads and sometimes he
is more interested in how pretty the page looks than what the words say,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Proceedings study, Palmeri, Randolph Blake and other Vanderbilt
researchers put W.O. through a series of tests.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeri said that W.O. sees all printed words in colors, sometimes
letter-by-letter and sometimes syllable-by-syllable. Short words have a
single color while long words may have many.</TE>
<TE>   When W.O. was given a list of 100 words printed in black and white, he
said each one had a specific color. When the list was presented a second
time, weeks later, W.O. gave most words the same color, missing only some
that were either beige or off-white.</TE>
<TE>   "These associations are highly reliable," said Blake. "W.O. says that
the colors have stayed the same all his life and our observations lend
credence to the claim."</TE>
<TE>   In W.O.'s view, each numeral, except for zero and one, has a color
even if printed in black and white.</TE>
<TE>   When the researchers presented an image of the number 5 made up of
much smaller number 2s, W.O. saw the whole image as a five and it
appeared green. But when he looked at the small 2s that made up the
image, those numerals were orange.</TE>
<TE>   When the numbers were written out--such as two--they assumed another
color.</TE>
<TE>   Just how W.O. perceives this color is difficult to understand, the
researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "He tries to describe it to me and I still can't appreciate it. It's
like trying to describe colors to a person who can't see them," said
Palmeri. "How could you describe color to a blind person? You really
can't."</TE>
<TE>   Some researchers believe that about one in every 25,000 people has
synesthesia, Palmeri said. Some studies suggest it may be much more
common--closer to about one in every 200 people.</TE>
<TE>   One theory holds that the perception is inherited. W.O.'s mother,
maternal grandfather and great uncle also experience synesthesia, but
none of his siblings or children do.</TE>
<TE>   It's believed that synesthesia occurs because some parts of the brain
that perceive color are very close to parts to process speech, language
and music, Hubbard said.</TE>

<HD>Yanks Fans Shut Out in Cable Flap</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JIM FITZGERALD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PELHAM, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>There are 25 televisions at Rockwell's American Restaurant, every
one of them devoted to sports, but Derek Jeter's first home run of the
spring was nowhere to be seen.</LD>
<LD>   Like 3 million other households and businesses in the New York
metropolitan area, Rockwell's is a Cablevision customer. And Cablevision,
so far, is refusing to carry YES, the Yankees' new cable network, and the
130 games it will show this season.</LD>
<LD>   The pricing dispute threatens to leave a large portion of the metro
area with just a handful of televised, regular-season Yankee games.
Twenty will be carried on WCBS-TV, along with whatever Yankee games show
up as national games of the week.</LD>
<TE>   "That's not enough for me," said Pete Falzerano of White Plains, a
42-year-old retail business manager who says he's "about 9 1/2 on a scale
of 10 as a Yankee fan."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides say a settlement is still possible, but no bargaining is
scheduled with Opening Day barely a week away. YES has reached agreements
with the region's other major cable providers.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute centers on which Cablevision customers would pay for YES,
and how much.</TE>
<TE>   YES, seeking to maximize its audience, is insisting Cablevision make
it a basic channel, included in the basic price for all cable homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 27 regional sports networks in the United States and
they're all on basic, even the ones that Cablevison owns," said YES
Chairman Leo Hindery. He said YES would charge Cablevision $1.85 monthly
for each subscriber.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision wants to put YES on a "premium tier," available only to
those who pay extra, although it hasn't said how much.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very expensive programming," said Cablevision spokesman Charles
Schueler. "Given the cost, we believe our customers should have the
opportunity to decide whether to purchase the games."</TE>

<HD>Judge to Rule on Oregon's Suicide Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM McCALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>The fate of Oregon's physician-assisted suicide law went before a
federal judge Friday, with the state arguing that the federal government
has no right to interfere with a measure twice approved by the voters.</LD>
<LD>   The one-day hearing before U.S. District Judge Robert Jones came after
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft threatened to suspend or revoke the
drug-prescribing licenses of Oregon doctors who dispense lethal drugs to
patients who want to end their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Passed by referendum in 1994 and 1997, Oregon's Death With Dignity Act
allows patients with less than six months to live to ask a doctor to
prescribe a lethal combination of drugs. The law was the first of its
kind in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   In his Nov. 6 order, Ashcroft said helping a terminally ill patient
commit suicide is not a legitimate medical practice.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Bushong, an Oregon assistant attorney general, argued Friday
that a state has the right to regulate medical practice as it sees fit.
Moreover, he said, the Justice Department should have sought public
comment or debate before overriding a state law.</TE>
<TE>   The order "strikes at the heart of the will of the Oregon people,"
Bushong said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the federal government argued that Washington can
interpret the Controlled Substances Act to enforce drug laws uniformly
and protect public health. Gregory Katsas, a deputy U.S. attorney
general, said the act gives Ashcroft the authority to issue such
directives.</TE>
<TE>   At least 91 people have used the Oregon law to end their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has promised to issue a ruling within 30 days, but appeals
could tie the issue up for years.</TE>

<HD>Many Presidents Left Us With Some Famous Last Words</HD>
<DH>History: Our commanders in chief chose unique ways to express their
final thoughts.</DH>

<AU>LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Realistic or sentimental, full of hope or delivered with an eye on
the history books, the final words of America's presidents have been
dutifully recorded ever since George Washington uttered his on Dec. 14,
1799.</LD>
<LD>   "I die hard, but I am not afraid to go," Washington told his doctor
after being stricken with a violent throat infection at his Mount Vernon,
Va., estate. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   John Adams, who lived to be 91, approached his demise with humor.</LD>
<TE>   "I have lived in this old and frail tenement a great many years," he
wrote. "It is very much dilapidated, and from all I can learn, my
landlord doesn't intend to repair it."</TE>
<TE>   Adams' very last words are much quoted.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas Jefferson still lives," Adams said before his death on July 4,
1826. That was exactly 50 years after the publication of the Declaration
of Independence he had championed and Jefferson had written.</TE>
<TE>   In one of history's great coincidences, Jefferson died the same day
asking, "Is it the Fourth?"</TE>
<TE>   James Madison said in 1831 that he had traveled far further in time
than he had ever anticipated. "Having outlived so many of my
contemporaries, I ought not to forget that I may be thought to have
outlived myself," he said. The fourth president lived still longer, dying
five years later at 85.</TE>
<TE>   Woodrow Wilson retained his sense of humor even after a stroke. Told
that members of Congress were praying for him, Wilson had a pointed
question.</TE>
<TE>   "Which way, senator?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   William McKinley's actual last words in 1901, coming as they did after
he was shot at a public reception in Buffalo, N.Y., were quoted--and
acted upon--all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   "His will, not ours, be done," McKinley said on his deathbed. "Nearer
my God to Thee, nearer to Thee."</TE>
<TE>   Soon bands and choruses were playing and singing the hymn McKinley had
quoted, "Nearer my God to Thee.'</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Eisenhower's last thoughts before his death on March 28, 1969,
were accepting. "I want to go, God take me," he told his son, John.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Truman did not see much choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is headed for the same place, and they are headed on the
same train, and under the same engineer," Truman said in March 1951.
Truman did not catch his final train until Dec. 26, 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Lincoln could not speak for himself after he was shot on April
14, 1865, so Edwin Stanton, his secretary of War, got the enduring last
words.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he belongs to the ages," Stanton said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Johnson followed Lincoln to the White House but was impeached
and came within a single vote in the Senate of being removed from office.
Years later, Johnson was sent to the Senate by his fellow Tennesseans,
briefly becoming a member of the body that had weighed his fate.</TE>
<TE>   "When I die, I desire no better winding sheet than the Stars and
Stripes, and no softer pillow than the Constitution," he said before his
death in 1875.</TE>
<TE>   William Henry Harrison appeared to be offering guidance to Vice
President John Tyler before he died on April 4, 1841, just a month after
taking office. Tyler was not in the room, but Harrison addressed his
successor anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir--I wish you to understand the true principles of government. I
wish them carried out. I ask nothing more."</TE>
<TE>   Theodore Roosevelt, who had the last word on many subjects, did not
have any of his own. But he came close in a 1918 newspaper editorial. It
was written shortly after his son, Quentin, was killed in the skies over
France in World War I and some six months before his own death.</TE>
<TE>   "Only those are fit to live who are not afraid to die," Roosevelt
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "And none are fit to die who have shrunk from the joy of life and the
duty of life. Both life and death are part of the same Great Adventure."</TE>

<LD>It's as if Macy's life began a few weeks ago on the side of the
road.</LD>
<LD>   Alone and shivering, she wandered past unfamiliar houses and road
signs. She remembers reaching under the blue knit scarf covering her
shorn hair and feeling a bump on the back of her head. She remembers
searching the pockets of her jeans and long camel coat, coming up with
$24.31 and a pink cigarette lighter. But that's it. No wallet. No ID.</LD>
<LD>   It was just after midnight March 2 when she stepped into a phone booth
in tiny Round Hill, Va., a town 45 miles west of Washington. She called
911 and told the dispatcher she didn't know where she was--or who she
was.</LD>
<TE>   She can't recall how long she walked that night. And she can't
remember anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I wasn't born until that day," said Macy, who named herself
to avoid becoming known as Jane Doe. "All I remember is it was like I was
waking up and walking down a country road. I didn't recognize anything. I
was cold, I was scared and I didn't remember anything."</TE>
<TE>   Macy, who has voluntarily committed herself to a Northern Virginia
mental facility, has what her doctor calls a classic case of amnesia. Her
life before March 2 is blank. There are no mental snapshots of friends or
family, no recollections of playing tag in her old neighborhood. She
doesn't know if she is a wife, or a mother, or has a favorite color. She
remembers no movies, no books, no names, no faces, no places.</TE>
<TE>   As she watched CNN recently, she didn't recognize President Bush and
"didn't get it" when she saw footage of planes crashing into the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she can only wonder where she goes from here. She's at once
frightened and hopeful. But mostly, Macy said, it's emptiness that has
enveloped her.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't miss something you don't remember," she explained. "I hear
people talking about their families and I think, 'Family, what is that?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts say cases like Macy's, in which someone experiences
such a complete loss of memory, are rare but not unheard of. Amnesia can
be caused by a blow to the head, a medical condition such as a stroke or
brain tumor, or a traumatic event. Usually, the effects are short-term
and the period of time forgotten is limited. In many cases, the memories
eventually return.</TE>
<TE>   Macy's doctors said brain scans and other medical tests show that she
is healthy, and they suspect that she may have been through something so
terrible that her mind closed off her memories to protect her. Whatever
her past holds, Macy says, she wants to know.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to find out who I am and where I'm supposed to be," she said.
"No matter what it is, I have to go through with it."</TE>
<TE>   Macy, who has bright eyes, a warm laugh and appears to be in her 40s,
has no tattoos, no scars. Her only jewelry was a dainty watch with a
brown leather band. Fairfax County, Va., police Officer Keela Lowry, who
is trying to help Macy, ran her fingerprints through law enforcement and
military databases and has checked missing persons reports.</TE>
<TE>   Macy is searching too.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, she slipped on the clothes she wore that night--jeans
and a white sweatshirt with fans embroidered on the front--hoping that
the outfit would trigger some recollection. Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   When she goes out, she peers at customers in stores and drivers in
passing cars and wonders if she knows them.</TE>
<TE>   Macy has stumbled across things that seem familiar. A desire to paint
her nails a cheery bright pink made her think she used to like to primp.
A walk around a lake gave her the sense that she's an outdoors person.
She can't explain why she chose the name Macy, but wonders if her
subconscious has given her a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Macy's doctors say all she can do is wait. She said she's also
praying, even though she doesn't know if she worshiped before.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wheeler, an assistant professor of psychology at Temple
University, said Macy's memories are still there; she just can't reach
them. The brain stores different bits of a memory in different areas,
Wheeler explained--the roar of the crowd in one, the winning home run
somewhere else. The brain puts them together to form a memory of the
ballgame, but amnesia victims lose that ability.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tempting to say she had these memories and now they are wiped
out, but what's happened is now she can't put the traces of her memories
together," Wheeler said.</TE>
<TE>   As she waits for her memories to return, Macy is busy relearning
society's common past. Watching the news taught her that there is a war
in Afghanistan, and she is learning anew some classic-rock tunes. She
gobbles up the newspaper each day and is a History Channel fan.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, she joined some patients watching a television
documentary about the firefighters who responded to the terrorist
attacks. At first Macy was stunned, then she began asking questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'This can't be real,' " she said. "I was asking what
happened and they told me about the fire, and the Pentagon and the World
Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   If the people who are part of her old life find her, she still might
not remember them, medical experts said. But she can learn.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, Macy says that, for now, she's happily creating new
memories. "I believe God works in his own time," she said. "He brought me
here and I'm alive and breathing and healthy, and that in itself is a
miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Macy has befriended fellow patients, and one wrote her a poem. She's
decided she's fond of apple pie and can do without rap music.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting from nowhere," she said.</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Customs a Special Challenge for U.S. Judges</HD>
<DH>Law: Cultural idiosyncrasies of foreign-born must be weighed along
with domestic law in many cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE BOORSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>When Ahmad and Sharifa Shaban married in 1974, the conditions they
agreed to were standard for Cairo newlyweds: an oath that the bride was a
virgin, a $30 dowry, and a declaration that the union was in accordance
with "Almighty God's Holy Book."</LD>
<LD>   By the time the Shabans divorced 24 years later, the
gastroenterologist and his wife were living in a posh Southern California
neighborhood, had two kids and $3 million. The couple had Americanized,
but the wedding document they signed all those years ago was pure Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   And that's where the culture clash began.</LD>
<TE>   He flew in an expert, who said the document was a prenuptial agreement
under Egyptian law and that the couple's assets should be split up by an
Islamic authority--a move his lawyers thought would get him a better
deal.</TE>
<TE>   She hired an American lawyer who laid it out a little differently.
"But see, you're not in Egypt," the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   With immigration to the United States higher in the past decade than
at any time since the 1930s, cases like the Shabans' have become daily
fare in family courts--intimate battles balancing culture, family values
and law in one public forum.</TE>
<TE>   But trying to reconcile U.S. law with immigrants' ideas about
everything from child discipline to dividing assets can be tricky.</TE>
<TE>   Until they were pressed to do so in the last five to 10 years, family
courts made few allowances for their increasingly international
constituents. There was no push for legal forms in multiple languages,
translators or experts on foreign culture and family law.</TE>
<TE>   Then the population started to change. According to the Census Bureau,
more than 10% of Americans are now foreign-born--and more than one-third
of that group came here in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Now family courts are starting to try to accommodate immigrants, even
as advocates criticize the system for not keeping up.</TE>
<TE>   Among other steps, there is more cultural-literacy training for
judges, a push for certified translators, and more research about culture
in court from groups like the American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized most people who are judges and attorneys are not like
those people who end up in court," said the ABA's Karen Aileen Howze, who
writes guides for court workers on cultural issues.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, judges might have simply made do without translators, for
example--but not today, said Justice Jeremy A. Stahlin of the Probate and
Family Court in Suffolk County, Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an awareness that it's unacceptable, totally unfair
and unjust" for different populations to get unequal levels of service
from the courts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   This shift wasn't prompted solely by demographics, but also by a wider
discussion in society in general: What are American values in an
increasingly diverse nation?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what it is to be an American because we're made up of
so many groups, people are afraid the country will disintegrate," says
Alison Dundes Renteln, a professor at USC who studies cultural defense in
family and criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   There are no hard figures on how often cultural issues arise in family
courts these days, but people who work there say it is frequent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest issues," said Judge Mary Sheffield of Phelps
County, Mo. Phelps recently stepped down as president of the National
College of Probate Judges, a group that routinely handles family issues,
including estate administration.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the country's growing ethnic diversity was put at the
top of the agenda recently by several prominent judicial groups,
including the State Justice Institute, a federally funded think tank for
judges and the National Center for State Courts, both in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But policy discussions can only go so far. In many areas of family
court law, judges have wide discretion, using their own cultural
compasses to navigate broadly worded statutes, such as those forbidding
abuse or neglect.</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with litigants from other countries brings new challenges to
the job:</TE>
<TE>   * When deciding custody cases, should judges take into consideration
the stigma that children in some places, including parts of West Africa,
face when they are in the care of their mother alone?</TE>
<TE>   * In nations from Japan to Guatemala, parents who are viewed as
healthy and nurturing share their bed with their young children, while
some American judges consider that unwholesome. How can judges reconcile
those views?</TE>
<TE>   * At what age can children be left home alone--and for how long?</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, families leave their children with children who they
consider old enough to baby-sit, and then they wind up in court because
you left an 8-year-old with an infant," Sheffield said.</TE>
<TE>   Working as a probation officer and clerk in the Middlesex County
family courts, just outside of Boston, Angelo Gomez Jr. knew judges who
would give girls under the legal marriage age of 18 permission to marry.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges would allow girls as young as 14 to marry, saying it was a
matter of cultural custom. Other judges wouldn't give their OK; they
believed the girls were squandering their opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Although judges are allowed to grant exceptions to the marriage age
limit, Gomez says, "the discrepancies between the judges is amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Should culture figure into a judge's decision? Court workers from
attorneys to psychologists to judges themselves say the goal should be an
educated judiciary--which can recognize the cultural context of people's
actions and take that information into account.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon in Bronx Family Court, a woman from Ivory Coast
was desperately trying to get her children brought back from that West
African country so she could have a custody trial against her husband,
who she claimed was abusive. The woman was having trouble persuading the
judge that the reason her own relatives in Africa wouldn't help her
retrieve the children was because they were ashamed she had left her
husband.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for a judge to understand her powerlessness," said Dorchen
Leidholdt, the woman's attorney and the director of a battered women's
advocacy program in New York City called Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Judges from Missouri to Massachusetts concede that there are gaps in
their cultural understanding, and they support state efforts to get them
training.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure any of the judges here really know what the cultural
differences are--there's a big problem. But it's just a matter of getting
into school and learning," said Judge Haywood Barry, who recently retired
after 24 years working on family issues in southeastern Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   States in recent years have been offering more cultural diversity
courses at judge-training conferences. The sessions can explain the
traditions of an immigrant group that is growing in a particular region,
or they can answer judges' cultural questions.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany Roper, a child advocate near the Mexican border, says she sees
the ramifications of an uneducated judiciary all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges consider immigrant homes unstable because cousins and
uncles come and go, she says. They'll hint at problems like drug use, for
example, in custody cases.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll say, 'There's a lot of traffic coming in and out of the home,
if you know what I mean,' " says Roper, co-director of the Children's
Rights Clinic at the University of Texas law school. In reality, she
says, extended family members are as welcome as immediate relatives in
Mexican homes.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southern California divorce case, judges found the Egyptian
wedding document too vague and said putting the case in a religious
official's hands would not guarantee compliance with California law. But
Dr. Shaban's attorneys said the judges had no understanding of Islamic
law, which they argued would guarantee a fair settlement for all under
California statutes.</TE>
<TE>   One judge wrongly said the wedding document was in Persian, not
Arabic; another suggested the physician had essentially purchased his
wife, which Shaban said reflected "nothing but . . . ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   But cultural ignorance can cut both ways. Many newcomers don't
understand the U.S. court system, or have been raised in places where
judges are symbols of terror.</TE>
<TE>   "What people expect affects what they ask for," says Leslye Orloff, an
immigration law specialist at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, many judges say, is that people who live in America
have to follow American rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd try to recognize if someone has come from a different cultural
background and grew up with a different idea of the norm," says Stahlin.
That would help put the person's behavior in context, he says, but it
probably wouldn't change his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in the Shabans' case.</TE>
<TE>   The marriage document may have been a prenuptial in Egypt, but county
and state appeals courts agreed that it wasn't specific enough to be one
under state law. Sharifa Shaban was ultimately awarded the standard share
of a divorce in California, 50%.</TE>
<TE>   In U.S. dollars, that's $1.5 million.</TE>

<HD>Farmers Market Subsidies Appear Destined to Be Uprooted</HD>
<DH>Government: Bush administration wants to end a program that
provides produce for the poor and the elderly, saying there are more
efficient ways to help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRASHER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The people of North Berwick, Maine, are not accustomed to getting
federal farm subsidies. But then the government started paying farmer
David Tuttle last year to give some of his tomatoes, strawberries and
other produce to 200 senior citizens in the area.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't imagine what a joy that was to me," said Alice Eaton, who
received $200 worth of produce, including several bushels of tomatoes and
string beans. "I had all that beautiful stuff all summer and I've enjoyed
it all winter long, frozen and canned."</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration now wants to abolish such subsidies, which
allow poor pregnant women and new mothers as well as low-income elderly
people to buy produce at farmers markets and fruit stands.</LD>
<TE>   The administration, which is pushing Congress to expand eligibility
for food stamps, believes the farmers market program provides too little
help to too few people.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the 2.7 million people who participated in it received an
average of just $12 worth of fruits and vegetables per person.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bost, the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for food and
nutrition services, told a congressional committee recently he would be
"happy as a peach" if lawmakers continued paying for the program.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the government needed to focus its spending on
"broad-based, more universally established" programs. "We accept the need
and responsibility for making tough choices," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration included no money for the program in the
Agriculture Department's 2003 budget and has resisted increasing spending
to meet demand this year.</TE>
<TE>   Several states that participated last year, including Connecticut,
Florida and New Jersey, are not expected to get any money for the portion
of the program that benefits senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The produce subsidies, however, are popular with many lawmakers,
especially those from outside the grain and cotton states that
traditionally have dominated federal farm spending. Virtually all of the
$20 billion in direct farm payments the government made last year went to
producers of corn, wheat, cotton, rice and soybeans.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers market program "is the difference between a small
specialty farmer near an urban area being able to stay in business or
not," said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   The subsidies started in 1989 as a pilot program that allowed
participants in the department's Women, Infants and Children nutrition
program to buy produce at farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the program was expanded to subsidize purchases by senior
citizens. This subsidy would become permanent under bills passed by the
House and Senate to reauthorize agriculture and nutrition programs.</TE>
<TE>   The average purchases under the program are low because many of the
beneficiaries lack the transportation to get to farmers markets, said Zy
Weinberg, director of the National Assn. of Farmers Market Nutrition
Programs, an organization that represents state and tribal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned about increasing access to fresh fruits and
vegetables for low-income people. These programs, as small as they are,
do provide that opportunity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle, the Maine farmer, received $20,000 through the program last
year after signing up Eaton and 200 others who agreed to take his
produce.</TE>
<TE>   Although the money represented just 5% of his revenue last year, the
cash came at just the right time, in the spring, to help cover the cost
of planting his crops, he said. He hopes to add 50 more people this year.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the season, Tuttle must provide the state an accounting
of how much food he distributed.</TE>
<TE>   "The senior citizens win and the farmers win. I love programs where
the taxpayers' money is just doing so much good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 14,600 farmers participated in the program nationwide last year.</TE>

<HD>New Leadership for El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The internal politics of the county's El Toro battle have been
catching up with El Toro redevelopment chief Gary Simon's pragmatic
(and job-preserving) resolve to stay flexible on exactly what plan
gets implemented. While focusing in recent months on the airport, he
also had said previously that his agency stood ready to plan
something else instead if that was the will of the voters.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of Measure W, the March 5 initiative that rezoned
the base for a park, the airport Simon was planning is out. So now
what? And more important, who plans what comes next--Simon and his
team, or someone else?</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer and Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who
agreed on nothing about El Toro for years, proposed moving Simon and
his authority under the county's chief executive, Michael Schumacher.
This move, on which a decision was deferred to April 16, may have
some merit.</LD>
<TE>   But in reality, the question of the reporting arrangement is a
side issue, less pressing than making the El Toro planning authority
more representative. And then there is the question of whether Simon
should remain, even if the authority's composition changes.</TE>
<TE>   He probably could head such an agency, provided he could work with
people he hasn't before. But it also might make sense to have a
change at the top. But before that issue is decided, it is necessary
to answer the basic question of whom the reuse authority represents
and fix its current shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon stays and the county retains El Toro planning authority,
it might make sense to have Schumacher be the person Simon reports
to. It would be more efficient, and there isn't the John Wayne
Airport revenue stream available anymore to feed El Toro planning.</TE>
<TE>   The short time frame for either a plan or a sale brings the need
to resolve the future of the authority into focus. The Navy has set a
deadline of April 23 for deciding what to do with the property, and
that forces the county's hand.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, nothing in federal community base reuse guidelines
suggests that only a county board of supervisors can represent
community interests adequately as a Local Redevelopment Authority.</TE>
<TE>   A community of interest surrounding a closed military base can
have any kind of LRA it wants. In fact, everything that has happened
recently argues for a much broader planning group, since the
supervisors acting alone have had their chance and bungled it.</TE>
<TE>   Time is short, an argument against reconstitution. But there is at
least an opportunity to signal local intention to do more
representative planning. At Tuesday's supervisors meeting, there was
encouraging movement in that direction when Coad moved toward
enlisting the help of antiairport factions in reuse planning. This
process must move forward quickly. What the county needs to do is be
sure that it doesn't simply change the reporting arrangements with an
agency that arguably needs to be more representative. It needs to
take a broader look at exactly how future planning for the base will
take place. Irvine's claim on annexation deserves serious
consideration too, because surrounding communities have expressed
confidence in what that city would do. Either way, the county must
bring others on board in a more formal way. Then worry about who
heads the authority.</TE>

<LD>Even in the unpredictable world of politics, it's not often that we
hear of a situation in which one candidate is eager to get out of the
race and an opponent wants him to stay in. The saga of Orange County
Judge Ronald C. Kline, under house arrest for criminal charges for
child molestation and child pornography, continues to unfold with a
remarkable series of twists and turns.</LD>
<LD>   The latest developments in the emerging runoff election are
complicated enough. Kline, mindful no doubt that he still could
receive his salary for the remainder of his term, opted to minimize
the bad publicity by withdrawing from the runoff campaign now. Surely
two surviving runoff candidates who would then square off would make
it a point of running against him anyway, but it would not be quite
the same if he were no longer a viable candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The leading write-in vote getter, Dana Point attorney John Adams,
has his own interests and would much prefer to run against Kline
rather than having the campaign open up to a wide-open battle for the
seat between him and the second-highest write-in vote getter. He has
taken an early lead and publicly opposed Kline's withdrawal.</LD>
<TE>   From the public's point of view, it would be desirable under the
best of circumstances to have a wide-open race, where candidates
barely known during a hasty write-in campaign get a chance to make
their cases before the public on a fresh canvas. But it's not so
simple. Enter the courts and election law.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates can't be removed legally unless they are appointed to
another office or die well before the election. The courts generally
have held that the names remain on.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the public interest in this complicated story, or more
precisely, what it is that the public is likely to come away with
from a runoff, considering the narrow interpretation of law, is
difficult. In the best of all worlds, Kline would be granted his wish
and the public would hear a fresh campaign conducted from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   But while Kline fights his legal battle, the public may have to be
satisfied for now knowing that there really will be at least one
viable alternative to an incumbent accused of very serious charges.</TE>
<TE>   Only a remarkable effort by last-minute write-in candidates to
educate the electorate brought the election process to this point. It
seemed more likely that the incumbent would simply get his 50% of the
vote plus one and be unchallenged. For voters, it was necessary to
get up to speed on write-in procedures and then properly mark and
punch the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The voters managed to do what they had to do. So whether the
public gets a race of two new candidates, or one new one with a
clearer shot at the incumbent, it is in a better position now than it
was just before the last election.</TE>
<TE>   That's worth something.</TE>

<LD>The March 5 election suggests that Orange County voters have come to
an important crossroads in their long-standing opposition to tax
increases to ensure that public schools deliver a solid education.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in six North County districts did more than approve $490
million in construction bonds to fund new schools and renovate
existing buildings--some of which opened their doors well before
Disneyland's since-retired submarine ride first set out to sea. The
string of bond victories also signaled a newfound willingness by
historically conservative voters to shoulder necessary costs of
operating viable public education systems.</LD>
<LD>   With the El Toro airport debate grounded, the county's elected
officials shouldn't need an air traffic controller to tell them that
these forward-thinking voters are making education their priority.
The county's legislative delegations in Sacramento and Washington
also should set aside political differences and set about clearing
financial roadblocks created by under-funded and poorly structured
state and federal education mandates. There's plenty of work to be
done.</LD>
<TE>   Federal legislators should tackle the necessary business of
funding special-education programs that sap local school districts'
budgets. In Sacramento, elected representatives should push for a
rational funding formula that pays Orange County districts their fair
share. They should also address Sacramento's growing propensity to
earmark state funds for specific programs--in effect, taking control
of local districts.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine-based research firm Pacific Opinions found that
Republicans and Democrats alike prefer that bureaucracies, not
teachers and classroom programs, feel the pain of impending budget
cuts. Those voters should listen when administrators say that school
boards no longer can balance budgets simply by freeing up more
parking spaces at the district headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The pain clearly has spread to the classroom. Capistrano Unified
School District trimmed last year's budget by $6.5 million and now is
looking for another $6 million to cut. Saddleback Valley Unified
dropped music and science programs and laid off library clerks and
custodians rather than increase the number of students in its
classrooms. Imagine the hornet's nest to be stirred when
cash-strapped districts in the county opt out of the popular but
expensive state program that reduces class sizes, as Irvine Unified
did for the third grade.</TE>
<TE>   The school bond campaigns, together with local parcel tax measures
of recent years, signal that districts and voters are going to have
to go to the well. And unfortunately, there are more headaches ahead
for administrators. As important as the construction bond victories
are, fast-growing districts in South County know that operating
budgets will grow rather than shrink as much-needed classrooms are
built.</TE>

<LD>Re "Citing Higher Costs, O.C. Board Raises Parking, Other Airport
Fees," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   The Times reports that Supervisor Tom Wilson challenged John Wayne
Airport Director Alan Murphy by asking whether planning costs for an
El Toro airport were the cause of the projected operating loss at
John Wayne.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson knows as well as any of the supervisors that the El Toro
planning funds were paid for by revenue generated at John Wayne and
not by taxpayer funds.</LD>
<TE>   Such expenditures were mandated by Measure A. After the events of
Sept. 11, airport operating expenses rose dramatically, causing the
operating loss challenged by Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, a recent audit of John Wayne expenditures showed
proper handling of the airport funds vis-a-vis El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   This is another example of Wilson's continuing but unjustified
attack on John Wayne as a taxpayer burden while he is in denial that
opening El Toro would bring in large amounts of revenue to the
county.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mailers Gave Norby Break, Critics Charge," March 17:</LD>
<LD>   If the Voter Education Project slate mailers are being used to
circumvent fair election laws, the loophole needs to be closed. But
as nasty as the last-minute mailers were in the race between Cynthia
P. Coad and Chris Norby, they didn't sway some of us. Coad's record
did.</LD>
<LD>   When the voters approved Measure H, which designated tobacco
settlement money for health issues, Coad and two other supervisors
ignored the will of the people. Logically, if Measure W passed and
Coad had been reelected, voters would not have been able to count
upon Coad to abide by it. Supervisors are supposed to represent the
will of the voters. The two supervisors who voted with Coad on the
health measure might want to think about that.</LD>
<TE>   Jackie I. Brown</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How ironic that Coad supporters should cry foul over a legal
maneuver used to level the playing field in the supervisor race. Coad
bought her seat four years ago by acting as her own major
contributor--a legal but questionable tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Norby could not possibly match Coad's campaign funding. Even with
an inflated "fair market value" assigned to the contested slate
mailers that supported Norby, the final analysis unquestionably will
show that more money was spent promoting Coad.</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic too that the past eight years of wasted effort and
wrangling over El Toro also come down to deep pockets trying to
pervert the election process. Measure A, which originally hijacked
the base reuse process and mandated an airport at El Toro, was almost
entirely financed by one deep pocket. It took thousands of small
contributors to finally undo this travesty through Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Fairness in political campaigns is truly in the eye of the
beholder.</TE>

<HD>The Honorable Thing for Kline to Do? Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline now realizes he
lost the majority vote in the primary and that he has no chance of
winning the November election. So he wants to do the honorable thing
and remove his name from the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   If he really wants to do the honorable thing, he should resign
from office and stop drawing his $136,224 salary.</LD>
<LD>   Kline also filed his declaration of candidacy after he was placed
under house arrest. Where is the honor in that?</LD>
<TE>   At this point, Kline's wishes are irrelevant. Election law does
not allow candidates to withdraw after the primary election. It's not
the time to make changes to laws, especially because of a man such as
Kline.</TE>

<TE>   Re "In Kline's Case, the Dots Don't Seem to Connect," Dana
Parsons, March 15:</TE>
<TE>   Parsons writes: "The practical reality is that Kline, if found
guilty, will lose his judgeship simply by being a felon. That doesn't
address the issue of whether someone who looks at pornographic
pictures is automatically disqualified as a competent judge of cases
involving complex civil litigation."</TE>
<TE>   I agree that everyone is innocent until proved guilty, but that's
not Parsons' argument. The practical reality is that if I were found
guilty of making or receiving child pornography, child molestation,
bank robbery, murder or whatever, I would (no fanfare, please) lose
my job, my friends and my very anchor to society.</TE>
<TE>   Why should being a simple felon be less disgraceful for a judge
than it is for a priest, a politician or any of us? It's fine when a
celebrity or rock star shows an incredible lack of judgment. But
society expects much more from a judicial authority. Sorry, but some
standards must be maintained.</TE>

<LD>Re "Man Is Sharing His Viewpoint," March 8:</LD>
<LD>   I am greatly cheered by Joseph E. Brown's gift of land to Laguna
Beach for an ocean-overlook park. I have become increasingly
depressed in recent years by the intense urbanization of the Southern
California coast. I spent my childhood during the 1930s in Laguna
Beach, and I especially remember Laguna's oceanfront Heisler Park.
From its cliff-top vistas the public had an unobstructed view of
Laguna's magnificent coastline as well as unrestricted access to the
beaches.</LD>
<LD>   I don't remember who Heisler was, but we need more people like him
and Brown, who have stepped forward with generous land gifts to
preserve open space on our coast. We don't need any more of those
individuals who seek to possess our coast for their own use by
walling it off from public view and public access.</LD>

<LD>Re "Whispering Hills Draws an Outcry," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   I can't believe I'm writing in favor of the Whispering Hills
development. But because San Juan Capistrano is in dire need of a
high school, we have to use common sense and weigh the issues.</LD>
<LD>   We cannot keep asking our children to attend overcrowded schools
in other towns and expect them to be happy, socially responsible
teenagers. I've seen my child lose touch with friends who went to
high schools in other towns. It has had a negative impact on his
life.</LD>
<TE>   It is sad that we have not had more responsible development. But
Whispering Hills seems to be the only way to get a school as soon as
possible. This fairly small development won't have the negative
impact of Ladera, and I've seen no public outcry about it.</TE>

<TE>   Every year it's the same old story during negotiations between the
teachers and the Capistrano Unified School District. This year has
proved no different.</TE>
<TE>   Like clockwork, the district comes out with a report highlighting
a supposed "fiscal squeeze." The district predicts a doom-and-gloom
scenario for the budget, but as each one of their budget concerns is
put to rest, it comes up with yet another to take its place.
Historically, the district ends the year with more funds than
projected in its ending balance, and 2001 was no different.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 22 of 28 districts in Orange County have settled at or
above a 4% salary increase for teachers. These other districts also
have to deal with the encroachment of programs like special
education, transportation and reduced class sizes. So why can't
Capistrano Unified offer an equitable settlement, as the other
districts seem to be able to do?</TE>
<TE>   The yearly ordeal of being one of the last districts to settle
with teachers tells Capistrano Unified teachers that they are neither
respected nor valued.</TE>

<TE>   I wonder. Had Measure W not passed, would Smith still have made
that comment about the free clinics? Why didn't he say that when the
county was spending $60million promoting an unwanted airport at El
Toro?</TE>
<TE>   Sorry Chuck, we ain't buyin' it!</TE>

<TE>   NIMBY shortsightedness in the passage of Measure W has taken over
in Orange County and could lead to major problems. The airport at El
Toro battle should have remained a basic economic debate centered on
business and taxpayer concerns. Instead, the El Toro issue turned
political.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Rep. Christopher Cox, Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom
Wilson, Assemblyman John Campbell and other South County legislators
and city leaders opted to follow the herd instinct rather than really
lead. The Irvine Co., following it personal and parochial financial
instincts, remained publicly silent but probably fueled anti-airport
sentiment for its own gain.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W's passage could cost Orange County billions of dollars
in lost economic growth, people incomes and tax revenues. So what's
to be done? The courts have got to overturn Measure W and save Orange
County from gross economic folly.</TE>

<LD>Re "School Bonds Need Matching Funds," March 7:</LD>
<LD>   After a challenging election in which voters were asked to approve
three bond measures in the Fullerton, I would like to thank Fullerton
for its outstanding support. Fullerton voters supported bonds with
their votes, their money, volunteer hours and endorsements. This city
is proud of its schools. Each school site will have renewed vitality
because of that pride.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Don Bankhead endorsed the bond issue and actively encouraged
others to support it. Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher and state Sen.
Richard Ackerman recognized the documented needs of the Fullerton
schools and gave their encouragement and endorsements.</LD>
<TE>   The Fullerton School District appreciates your vote of confidence.
An oversight committee is being formed according to state guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Principals, teachers, employees, parents, board members, business
owners, civic leaders and others joined together to affirm that
Fullerton remains the "Education Community."</TE>

<LD>Re "Red Cross Word Ban Keeps Students Off Stage," March 10:</LD>
<LD>   It has come to the attention of many American citizens since the
9/11 catastrophe that the American Red Cross has done some unseemly
things.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent event occurred in our own backyard in Orange
County when a school choral group was told by the "American" Red
Cross that they could not sing "America the Beautiful," "God Bless
the USA" or any song that used the words "God" or "prayer."</LD>
<TE>   The Red Cross said the decision was based on its "sensitivity to
religious diversity" and the desire for a music program that was
"inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   It is a sad commentary when the only time that some people can
stomach God or prayer is when a catastrophe hits. Do you remember
when Congress broke into a spontaneous rendition of "God Bless
America"? Does this make the secular elites who so aggressively
attack any reference to religion look foolish? Does "American" still
fit in the title of "American Red Cross"?</TE>
<TE>   On this very day we received a request to donate money to
America's Disaster Relief Agency. We don't think so.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Sharon Hendershot</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again the spineless specter of political correctness strikes,
and this time it robs seventh- and eighth-grade students of their
freedom of expression by keeping them from singing a song dedicated
to rescue personnel who responded on 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Our Red Cross has fallen in line with other wishy-washy
bureaucratic institutions by fearing that anyone attending their
awards ceremony might be offended by children singing "America the
Beautiful" and "Prayer of the Children."</TE>
<TE>   Heaven forbid that anyone should be offended! Better to offend the
children who have worked so hard for a good cause.</TE>
<TE>   Come to think of it, by their spineless act of hurting the
children, the Red Cross has offended me. Such spiritless and
unthinking actions have made the word "offensive" synonymous with
"censored."</TE>

<LD>Re "Three Boys Arrested in Assault," March 11:</LD>
<LD>   Hate crimes are not acceptable or tolerated in our city. We decry
all bigoted and vicious actions. Please know this attack does not
represent the thinking of the majority of Huntington Beach residents.
Most of us take great pride in our community and enjoy the cultural
diversity that enriches our quality of life. Many of us devote time
and effort to help celebrate that diversity and to encourage the
support of human dignity for all people.</LD>
<LD>   Through the work of our Human Relations Task Force, we have made
progress in Huntington Beach. This shameful event is a wake-up call
that our work is far from finished. We will continue efforts to make
Huntington Beach a community in which people live together in peace,
understanding and mutual respect.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am greatly saddened by the racially motivated attack on Aris
Gaddvang, a Filipino American, only blocks from my home. I have
personally seen racial hatred directed toward my wife, a Filipino
American. But what bothers me are the comments made by Mayor Debbie
Cook, who called on schools to do more to educate young people about
racial tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Having been a teacher, counselor and public school administrator,
I'm tired of politicians placing all the ills of society squarely on
the shoulders of schools. Cook's comment suggests that schools aren't
doing enough, that these 14-year-old boys did not learn anything
about racial tolerance in school.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Cook then says, "I sometimes wonder what's going on. Is it
problems that are inherent in the schools that need to be addressed?"
What an irresponsible and insulting remark for the mayor to direct at
schools.</TE>
<TE>   I have worked in racially diverse schools for 18 years, and I can
tell you that racial hatred and bigotry begin in the home. No amount
of education will undo what is acceptable at home.</TE>
<TE>   Racial hatred is not innate but learned. It galls me that Cook
would imply that schools have anything to do with these hatemongers.
Schools are asked to teach children about manners, proper behavior,
morals, good characters, drug abuse, sexual harassment and, yes,
racial tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   We also fit in math, science, history, English, physical education
and many other worthwhile subjects. Racial intolerance is not a
problem inherent in schools. The mayor's irresponsible implications
further erode the spirit of hard-working, dedicated educators who
form the backbone of American culture and society.</TE>

<LD>Re "Protest Trip Ends at Taco Bell," March 12:</LD>
<LD>   Tomato pickers are so underpaid that they can take 12 days off
from work to protest at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine.
Organizers of the protest complain that tomato pickers earn 40 cents
per bucket, unchanged since 1978.</LD>
<LD>   But before crying foul, tomato pickers need to take a basic
economic class. Wages for hard-working tomato pickers have remained
flat for 25 years because of supply and demand. Each year hundreds of
thousands of illegal immigrants from Mexico enter the U.S. to compete
for the thousands of jobs available for tomato pickers. This is the
primary reason why the wages in this labor intense industry have not
risen in 25 years. There are just too many workers willing to work
for 40 cents a bucket of tomatoes.</LD>
<TE>   Wages will rise as soon as the demand for tomato pickers exceeds
the supply. Tomato pickers should demand that the U.S. government
deter illegal immigration and reduce the supply of tomato pickers.</TE>

created by the planning for an international airport is over, and the

<LD>Re "Schools Are Rethinking Traffic Safety," March 14:</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations to Ron LaMotte, principal of Top of the World
Elementary School in Laguna Beach. His efforts to keep students safe
from vehicles must be applauded.</LD>
<LD>   However, in the wake of the Anaheim school tragedy that left two
young girls dead, a quote by Sandy Fiddler, a transportation analyst
for the Orange County Department of Education, is troubling. While
discussing school safety plans, she states, "It may turn out there is
nothing anyone can do."</LD>
<TE>   Of course there are things to do, and they must be done
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   * Move the vehicles far from where kids wait.</TE>
<TE>   * Put up heavy fences.</TE>
<TE>   * Install concrete medians.</TE>
<TE>   * Employ many more qualified and capable adult monitors.</TE>
<TE>   * Insist on having just one exit and one entrance at schools.</TE>
<TE>   Please designate LaMotte as chairman of the safety committee that
should have been formed yesterday. We simply cannot stand another
Eagle Rock or Anaheim incident.</TE>

<TE>   Along with so many other readers, I felt the pain of the parents
and siblings of the two children killed while waiting to be picked up
from grade school. You could feel the reporters' frustration as they
wrote about the major traffic problems at so many of our grade
schools. Adding to that frustration is the attitude of school
administrators who feel that nothing can be done, what with
overcrowded schools and limited budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Educators are not traffic experts. Where are the police and fire
departments? Where are the traffic experts who tell us what needs to
be done to improve the flow of traffic on the 405? Why can't the same
people make recommendations to improve traffic safety at our schools?</TE>

<LD>   The community-based, nonprofit Orange County Youth &amp; Family
Services operates the Truancy Learning Center, where students and

<TE>   I question Orange County's motive in cracking down on parents of
truants. Whom are we teaching a lesson? Granted, there are parents
who dismiss the fact that sending their children to school is the
law. However, most parents do not.</TE>
<TE>   Parents can go only so far to try to protect their child from harm
and wrongdoing. Believing that the court can have such power
indirectly over children and their family is a mistake. Punishing
parents will not lead to a decrease in truancies.</TE>

<LD>   Orange County Fire Authority Fire Chief Chip Prather is seeking
authorization at the March 28 meeting of the Board of Directors to
remove 17 fire engines and one ladder truck from service. Emergency
response capabilities will be downgraded countywide and 254 volunteer
firefighters no longer will get training and equipment to fight
fires.</LD>
<LD>   A consultant hired to assist in the authority's restructuring
outlines two options. The first option keeps volunteers as front-line
fire suppression personnel. The second option, backed by Chief
Prather, significantly reduces the volunteer role in firefighting.</LD>
<TE>   The option being backed by Chief Prather would reduce fire-safety
resources by approximately 18% but save approximately 1% of the
annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   No businessman would consider this draconian cut, and neither
should the Orange County Fire Authority.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities sifted through a fire-gutted Beverly Hills mansion on
Saturday, searching for clues to the cause of the blaze that
destroyed it.</LD>
<LD>   Two people in the 7,000-square-foot home in the 9400 block of
Sunset Boulevard managed to flee the fire unhurt Friday night, said
Beverly Hills Deputy Fire Chief Robert Cavaglieri. The home, which
belongs to philanthropists Stewart and Lynda Resnick, according to
records, has been valued at more than $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   As more than 60 firefighters from Beverly Hills and the city and
county of Los Angeles arrived to combat the blaze, 40-foot flames
shot out from the rooftop, Cavaglieri said. The blaze's quick spread
may have been aided by recently applied paint that may have acted as
fuel for the flames, as well as a wood shingle roof, Cavaglieri said.</LD>
<TE>   Crews battled the fire for more than an hour before extinguishing
it at 8:45 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Dean Bumpus, 89; Used 200,000 Bottles to Track Ocean
Currents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For centuries people have launched bottles into the seas for
sentimental reasons--to preserve a paean to lost love, perhaps, or to
feed a basic human desire to touch a soul in a distant land.</LD>
<LD>   Dean Bumpus did it for science--and on a scale that likely has no
rival.</LD>
<LD>   To track ocean currents, the scientist at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts pitched tens of thousands
of glass vessels into the North Atlantic for 30 years, starting in
1948.</LD>
<TE>   "Break This Bottle," the labels Bumpus affixed to them read.</TE>
<TE>   Inside each was a postcard asking the finder to reply with the
date and place the bottle was found. In return, Bumpus sent a 50-cent
reward.</TE>
<TE>   Though primitive, Bumpus' methodology enabled him to write a
pioneering study of coastal circulation off the Eastern United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "His bottle studies are monumental and, according to my studies,
released more bottles than anyone," said Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a Seattle
scientist who, as a byproduct of plotting the paths of ocean
pollutants, became the country's foremost expert on high seas
flotsam. "I greatly admired his work," Ebbesmeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly how many bottles were set adrift by Bumpus,
who died March 14 at his home in Woods Hole after a distinguished
40-year career in oceanography. Known as "Bump" to his colleagues, he
was 89.</TE>
<TE>   He once said that during the 1960s alone he or his conscripts
flung 165,566 bottles from ships and planes along the East Coast.
Ebbesmeyer suspects the total number throughout Bumpus' research well
exceeded 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Many were presumed sunk under the weight of barnacles that may
have attached themselves to the bottles on the high seas. Despite
such perils, the return rate during the '60s was about 10%--some
16,000 bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Most were found along the 600-mile stretch of the Eastern Seaboard
between Cape Hatteras and the tip of Maine. But some washed up in
Ireland. One bottle got as far as the Mediterranean Sea.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey dropped one of
Bumpus' drifters from the institute's research vessel, Atlantis II,
off Gloucester, Mass. It turned up just 20 miles away--four years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Another bottle was adrift for 33 years. No. 4653, launched from a
research ship in the mid-Atlantic north of Bermuda in 1951, was
returned to the institute in 1984 after it was found on a New Jersey
beach.</TE>
<TE>   In all those years, Bumpus said, he was "held up" only once--by a
hard-bargaining woman in Vero Beach, Fla., who sniffed at his measly
reward.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one of your bottles," she wrote. "I collect things of this
sort when I find them. I also collect $2 bills. That is what it will
take to get the number off this bottle and where I found it."</TE>
<TE>   Another time a man in Canada wrote a poem about one of the drift
bottles. Bumpus tracked him down. He lived in a house with a dirt
floor strewn with fish bones and other things. In a corner was a
battered typewriter where the clam-digger poet had created his simple
verse.</TE>
<TE>   He was "one of those fellows who liked to write, but no one would
ever accept his stuff," Bumpus said. "Later, I wrote an article about
it and I got paid $50 for it. I sent him $25 and he was delighted."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever he got a postcard back, he pondered the many variables
that shaped the bottle's journey. If the bottle was found on a beach,
for instance, how long did it sit there before someone picked it up?
"There are lots of subtleties in how to interpret the 'birth' and
'death' notice without knowing the life in between," said Robert
Beardsley, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole research center.</TE>
<TE>   Plotting the route of the bottles, however, led to Bumpus' finding
that ocean currents south of Cape Hatteras move in very different
patterns from those northward.</TE>
<TE>   "It was his genius," Beardsley said, "to make sense out of
something that to us would seem very difficult to interpret."</TE>
<TE>   The result, flotsam specialist Ebbesmeyer said, was "a pivotal
data set for studying transatlantic drift," useful to anyone trying
to determine the path of an oil spill, for instance, or how certain
plant species traveled from the Americas to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Bumpus was born in Newburyport, Mass. He studied biology at
Oberlin College, graduating in 1933. After graduate work at Brown
University, he joined the staff of Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in 1937, becoming one of its first year-round employees.
He also studied at Harvard College.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s, he helped develop a comprehensive sampler of
plankton life at the Georges Bank fishing ground off the
Massachusetts coast. It continues to yield important findings today.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he was among a group of Woods Hole scientists
who taught Navy submariners "how to play hide and seek" by using the
temperature and density gradients of the water to avoid acoustic
detection by enemy vessels.</TE>
<TE>   His bottle mania may have come from working closely with the
institute's first director, Henry Bryant Bigelow, who used bottles to
study ocean circulation as early as 1915. But the technique was not
unique to either man. Theophrastus, the influential botanist of
antiquity, was believed to have used glass bottles to map currents in
the Mediterranean several centuries before Christ.</TE>
<TE>   What is probably safe to say is that neither ancient nor more
modern mariners lent as much gusto to the hunt for bottles as Bumpus.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1959, Bumpus, an award-winning scoutmaster known for
his hearty "haw haw haw" laugh, issued this memo to colleagues:</TE>
<TE>   "All hands are respectfully requested [until further notice] to
bring their dead soldiers to the lab and deposit them in the box just
inside the gate. Whiskey, rum, beer, wine or champagne bottles will
be used to make drift bottles. Any clean bottles--8 oz. to one quart
in size--will be gratefully received.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottoms Up!"</TE>
<TE>   He remained devoted to his bottles even when more sophisticated
devices--electronic current meters tracked by satellite--became
available.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Warren, another senior scientist at Woods Hole who knew
Bumpus for many years, recalled a visit in the 1970s from a team of
young researchers who were using the latest technology to measure
currents in the same waters Bumpus had been littering for decades.</TE>
<TE>   After having dinner with them, Warren returned to the office to
find his colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Bump, they were really cursing you out.' He was quite
alarmed. He said, 'Why? Why?' I told him that much of what they found
out he had already found out, with his bottles. He was delighted and
sat back and said, 'Haw, haw, haw.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bumpus retired in 1978. His bottles are still coming in.</TE>

<HD>Schools Give Cell Firms Warm Reception</HD>
<DH>Phones: Dozens of Southland districts rent space for
antennas and other equipment. Deals ease educators' money woes, plug
service gaps.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cellular phone companies looking to boost coverage in their busiest
markets are finding enthusiastic partners in cash-strapped school
districts..</LD>
<LD>   Wireless carriers are paying tens of thousands of dollars in rent
each year to dozens of Southern California school districts for
places to put relay equipment and towers that help plug gaps in phone
service.</LD>
<LD>   ABC Unified, which serves Artesia and other cities in southeast
Los Angeles County, gets $1,000 a month for phone equipment hidden in
a pine tree at school district headquarters in Cerritos. At Dana
Hills High in Dana Point, three phone carriers share space on a
football stadium light tower.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a win-win situation," said Len Forkas, whose Reston, Va.,
company designs, builds, owns and rents thousands of such poles,
including many leased on school property.</TE>
<TE>   The agreements are vital to the booming wireless industry, which
has seen a nearly 150% increase in subscribers, to about 132 million,
in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Phone companies used to be trying to [sell] the coverage," said
Tom Flynn, director of operations for a Florida company that designs
and builds cellular towers and antennas. "But now they've got so many
subscribers, they need the capacity to handle it all."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there are places to put transmitting equipment besides
schools. Margaret Brown, spokeswoman for wireless giant Nextel
Communications, said only a small percentage of that company's 15,500
cellular antennas nationwide are on campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Cellular phone companies pay cities and other governmental
entities to place transmitting equipment on public buildings in
California and elsewhere. Churches also are reaping rewards as
service providers try to get antennas placed in bell towers, steeples
and sanctuary crosses.</TE>
<TE>   Like churches, schools offer a way into residential areas, where
people often are opposed to having unattractive relay equipment
dominating the landscape. "We look for the best place to serve our
customers," Brown said. "The best place to locate our equipment is
where we have the most customers."</TE>
<TE>   Nextel's sites range from a tower on a mountaintop to an antenna
connection hidden in a tree at a busy intersection.</TE>
<TE>   School Districts Accept Barter as Well as Cash</TE>
<TE>   Local schools aren't getting rich as landlords, but the districts
have been able to augment their cash-strapped budgets by signing
contracts with an array of carriers, or turnkeys who handle their
site acquisitions and permitting. One high school traded space on its
stadium light pole for construction of a snack bar.</TE>
<TE>   When AT&amp;T Wireless installed two antennas inside the football
stadium at Gahr High in Cerritos in 2000, ABC Unified received
$15,000, plus the first $1,300 monthly installment on a lease that
expires in 2015, said Gary Smuts, the district's deputy
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money is placed in a fund created to offset costs when
the schools host community events, Smuts said. "It's a break-even
proposition," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified's contracts with 13 carriers at three schools have
generated $552,000 for the district since 1989, with an additional
$100,000 on the way by 2005. Moreno Valley Unified receives $14,500
annually for two out-of-the-way sites at Moreno Valley High School.
Capistrano Unified gets about $1,000 a month from each of the five
carriers that lease space at Dana Hills and Capistrano Valley high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The first agreements were made nearly 20 years ago, and the down
payments weren't always cash.</TE>
<TE>   When the first of Capistrano Valley High's two cellular towers
went up next to the school's football field, the phone carrier built
restrooms for the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Located in separate square enclosures, the towers share space with
a small building that houses a backup generator. One enclosure is at
the edge of the school's track, about 50 feet from the newly sodded
southern end zone of the football field.</TE>
<TE>   At one end of the enclosure a sign hanging at eye level reads,
"Radio frequency fields beyond this point may exceed the FCC general
public exposure limit."</TE>
<TE>   The low-level radiation emitted from the antennas is a common
concern of community groups that occasionally oppose the partnerships
between schools and the phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   But the danger of such transmitting stations is generally regarded
as negligible. Experts such as John E. Moulder, professor of
radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin, say
radio-frequency radiation emitted by mobile phone antennas is too low
to be considered a health hazard, as long as people stay a few feet
from them.</TE>
<TE>   In a published medical article, Moulder wrote that people should
stay clear of the transmitting antennas, but that there was no danger
from the towers or masts that hold them.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Sendzik, who manages facilities and planning for Capistrano
Unified, said he hasn't received complaints about the cell towers at
Capistrano Valley or Dana Hills high schools, where the first antenna
was raised in exchange for the construction of the football stadium's
snack bar.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a public hearing for each pole, went through a whole set
of conditions, then had another hearing in front of our board,"
Sendzik said. "We had to certify everything met FCC regulations. If
they were violated, the pole could be removed."</TE>
<TE>   District Boards Have Final Say on Deals</TE>
<TE>   The decision to install cellular equipment at schools is usually
left to district boards, according to the Department of Education.
Based on the FCC's interpretation of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, state or local governments are prohibited from regulating
wireless service facilities based on environmental effects.</TE>
<TE>   Before that law was passed, some potential agreements between
schools and phone carriers were foiled by residents who complained to
local politicians that the towers would be an eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   The stability of the supporting towers in an earthquake or high
winds is a concern for some school districts. Palm Springs Unified
has spurned offers from several cellular companies because "the
liability exceeds the assets," said Bill Schmidt, director of
facilities and planning for the district.</TE>
<TE>   Most local districts have chosen to tuck the transmitting
equipment away from classrooms, near the athletic fields on their
high school campuses. For example, Capistrano Unified officials say
they are "tapped out" of available space at Capistrano Valley and
Dana Hills high schools, meaning the district will not pursue
additional partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Sendzik said the district will not allow cellular equipment at its
elementary schools, having already turned away one carrier that
wanted to do a study.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that's not a place for them," Sendzik said. "On a high
school site, you have more space available."</TE>
<TE>   Local schools seem willing to continue providing homes for
cellular equipment just as long as the sites aren't too intrusive
and, of course, the price is right.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Irvine Unified entered a five-year, $50,000 contract with
carriers that erected cell towers near the Irvine High baseball and
football fields. Later, the district added a tower at Rancho San
Joaquin Middle School and leased space inside a structure at
Woodbridge High.</TE>
<TE>   Each agreement includes a clause allowing the companies to add
other carriers to their towers at no additional charge, said Don
Chadd, the district's assistant superintendent of facilities,
development and construction.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem, in Chadd's view, is that the towers at Irvine
and Rancho San Joaquin stand out like 80-foot sore thumbs.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing the [school] board realized after the towers went in
was they weren't aesthetically pleasing," Chadd said. "So we
refrained from engaging in cell tower discussions for a number of
years."</TE>
<TE>   That's about to change. Chadd said he will begin negotiating on
sites at University and Northwood high schools, and he plans to be
more aggressive this time.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does he believe he can get higher rents, but newer cell
antennas are easier to hide.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, they're capable of making them look much more
sophisticated," he said. "So I told them to bring me something more
aesthetically pleasing."</TE>

<LD>An 18-year-old Oxnard woman was killed early Saturday when a
California Highway Patrol cruiser pursuing another vehicle
accidentally rammed the car in which she was riding.</LD>
<LD>   Jessica Ann Mohorko died at the scene.</LD>
<LD>   CHP Officer Jack Raughton was chasing a speeding vehicle about
midnight on Highway 1 near Gonzales Road in Oxnard, according to the
CHP. Raughton's wife, Officer Christina Raughton, was a passenger in
the patrol car.</LD>
<TE>   A 1994 Nissan Sentra driven by Christopher Edward Haynes, 18, of
Port Hueneme was stopped in a left-turn lane on the highway,
preparing to turn onto Gonzales, authorities said. As he started the
turn, the CHP car smashed into the Nissan's passenger side.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes had a broken arm and was taken to St. John's Regional
Medical Center. Mohorko suffered multiple blunt-force injuries,
according to a spokesman for the Ventura County coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The officers were treated for abrasions at Ventura County Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle they were chasing got away.</TE>
<TE>   CHP investigators are trying to determine how fast the vehicles
were traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Highway 1 was closed until 11:30 a.m. as police investigated the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated crash, a 43-year-old Oak View man was killed
Saturday morning in a collision on Santa Ana Road.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Fraser's car was hit by a sport utility vehicle that veered
into his path, according to police. He was pronounced dead at the
scene.</TE>

<LD>An Orange County sheriff's sergeant was shot in the face at
point-blank range during a gun battle at a Lake Forest strip mall
Saturday morning, prompting a massive manhunt and the arrest of two
reputed Santa Ana gang members.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Sgt. Kurt Vasentine, 45, was wounded while checking out
a suspicious car parked in an alley at the Lake Forest Market Place,
next to the Santa Ana Freeway, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.
A .380-caliber bullet hit Vasentine in the right cheek, traveled down
his neck and lodged under his right collarbone.</LD>
<LD>   During the gun battle, Vasentine wounded his assailant, who was
arrested when he checked himself into a hospital in Riverside, police
said. Police cordoned off the strip mall and closed Interstate 5
between Alicia Parkway and Lake Forest Drive for more than an hour,
backing up traffic for miles.</LD>
<TE>   Vasentine, a 23-year veteran, was listed in fair condition at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "He's incredibly fortunate that the bullet didn't ... destroy
vital organs," said Wayne Quint, president of the Assn. of Orange
County Sheriff's Deputies. "The most important thing ... was his will
to survive....The average person would just lay down. He got up and
took action; he fought back."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Vasentine was patrolling the area about 8
a.m. when he saw a white Nissan Altima parked in a secluded area of
the strip mall behind a building that houses several businesses,
including a Starbucks coffee shop, a Bank of America branch, a
Staples store and a jewelry store.</TE>
<TE>   A slender young man was inside the car with the seats reclined.
When Vasentine approached the car, the driver jumped out and tried to
run, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasentine did not know it at the time, but the white Nissan had
been stolen earlier in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Vasentine grabbed the suspect and the two wrestled. During the
tussle, the man reached into his right pocket, Amormino said, pulled
out a semi-automatic handgun and fired it into Vasentine's face.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded officer stumbled back, grabbed his weapon and traded
several shots with the gunman, who was hit in his right thigh.</TE>
<TE>   The bleeding suspect ran away. According to witnesses, he jumped
over a wall into a parking lot and waved frantically to an alleged
accomplice driving a black Toyota Avalon, Amormino said. Vasentine
got on his radio and called for help.</TE>
<TE>   The two suspects fled the scene minutes before a swarm of patrol
cars descended on the strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said the getaway car had been carjacked from a Santa Ana
man earlier Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   About seven hours after the shootout, Riverside sheriff's deputies
detained a 16-year-old boy who checked himself into Riverside
Community Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. Orange County
authorities were alerted.</TE>
<TE>   The teen's 20-year-old brother, identified as Miguel Valdivinos,
was arrested about the same time in Santa Ana, after police spotted
him driving the getaway car. Valdivinos led police on a brief car
chase and then tried to escape on foot before he was apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   Both are reputed Santa Ana street gang members and are being held
on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer, Amormino said.
Lake Forest has been the scene of two fatal shootings of deputies in
the last decade.</TE>

<LD>An Orange County sheriff's sergeant was shot in the face at
point-blank range during a gun battle at a Lake Forest strip mall
Saturday morning, prompting a massive manhunt and the arrest of two
reputed Santa Ana gang members.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Sgt. Kurt Vasentine, 45, was wounded while checking out
a suspicious car parked in an alley at the Lake Forest Market Place,
next to the Santa Ana Freeway, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.
A .380-caliber bullet hit Vasentine in the right cheek, traveled down

<LD>   During the gun battle, Vasentine wounded his assailant, who was
arrested when he checked himself into a hospital in Riverside, police
said. Police cordoned off the strip mall and closed Interstate 5
between Alicia Parkway and Lake Forest Drive for more than an hour,
backing up traffic for miles.</LD>
<TE>   Vasentine, a 23-year veteran, was listed in fair condition at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he
was being visited by his girlfriend, friends and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "He's incredibly fortunate that the bullet didn't ... destroy
vital organs," said Wayne Quint, president of the Assn. of Orange
County Sheriff's Deputies. "The most important thing ... was his will
to survive....The average person would just lay down. He got up and
took action; he fought back."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Vasentine was patrolling the area about 8
a.m. when he saw a white Nissan Altima parked in a secluded area of
the strip mall behind a building that houses several businesses,
including a Starbucks coffee shop, a Bank of America branch, a

<TE>   A slender young man was inside the car with the seats reclined.

<TE>   The bleeding suspect ran away. According to witnesses, he jumped

got on his radio and called for help.</TE>
<TE>   The two suspects fled the scene minutes before a swarm of patrol
cars descended on the strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a couple of pops," said a witness who declined to give
his name. "It was like fire crackers, but they kept going on and on
and I thought, 'Wow! Those aren't firecrackers, those are
gunshots....' There were maybe about 12 shots."</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Cathey, a sales manager at Staples, said he heard what may
have been gunshots but dismissed it at first. When he went to the
back of his store to unload some merchandise, he saw several patrol
cars and the wounded Vasentine sitting against a wall, surrounded by
other officers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was bleeding pretty badly," Cathey said. "It was a scary
scene."</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said the getaway car had been carjacked from a Santa Ana
man earlier Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They were obviously planning something," he said, possibly a
robbery of one of the mall's businesses.</TE>
<TE>   About seven hours after the shootout, Riverside sheriff's deputies
detained a 16-year-old boy who checked himself into Riverside
Community Hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg. Hospital staff
called Riverside Sheriffs, who alerted the Orange County authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The teen's 20-year-old brother, identified as Miguel Valdivinos,
was arrested about the same time in Santa Ana, after police spotted
him driving the getaway car. Valdivinos led police on a brief car
chase and then tried to escape on foot before he was apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   Both are reputed Santa Ana street gang members with extensive
criminal records and are being held on suspicion of attempted murder
of a police officer, Amormino said. At the Lake Forest substation
where Vasentine works, fellow Sgt. Rich White said Vasentine has a
reputation for vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he was commended for arresting a suspected car thief.
Vasentine spotted the suspect in a stolen car three hours after
dispatchers radioed a description of the vehicle, White said. "He
much prefers going out there and arresting crooks to anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest has been the scene of two fatal shootings of deputies
in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Brad Riches was gunned down June 12, 1999, outside a
convenience store by a man wielding an assault rifle. Maurice Gerald
Steskal, an unemployed laborer, was arrested and charged with Riches'
slaying. And on Christmas Day 1993, Deputy Darryn L. Robins was
fatally shot by his patrol partner during an informal training
exercise behind a movie theater. A grand jury rejected calls from
local prosecutors to indict Robins' partner, Brian J. Scanlan, for
the shooting.</TE>

<HD>3 Killed, 1 Critical After Car Slams Into Truck on 101</HD>

<LD>Three people were killed and a fourth critically injured in an early
morning crash on the Ventura Freeway in Encino that may have been
alcohol- and drug-related, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A speeding Nissan Altima slammed into the rear of a slow-moving
big rig on the eastbound 101, east of White Oak Avenue, about 1:50
a.m., according to the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   The car's driver, a 23-year-old Canoga Park man, and two
passengers--a 26-year-old Reseda man and a 17-year-old Van Nuys
girl--were killed.</LD>
<TE>   Their names were not released pending notification of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger in the front seat, Mireya Tejeda, 21, of Sylmar,
suffered major head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   She was transported to the Northridge Hospital Medical Center,
where she remained in the intensive-care unit on Saturday night,
according to a hospital spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Tejeda and the driver were wearing seat belts, but the passengers
in the back did not appear to be, the CHP said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck driver, Floyd Walker Jr., 38, of Greenville, S.C., was
not injured.</TE>
<TE>   "They did find potential street drugs, controlled substances and
are looking into possible alcohol use," said CHP Officer S. Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   The truck was in the far right lane traveling less than 5 mph due
to congestion caused by a previous crash.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan driver slammed on the brakes before crashing into the
semitrailer, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   A light rain was falling at the time of the accident, according to
the CHP.</TE>

<HD>El Camino Real Beats L.A. High in Super Quiz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may only be a fraction of a team's final score, but the Super Quiz
equals the anticipation of a game show. And winning doesn't feel half
bad either.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask El Camino Real High School, which on Saturday ended Los
Angeles High School's three-year reign as Super Quiz champions.</LD>
<LD>   The quiz counts for 4% of a team's overall score in the California
Academic Decathlon, being held in Modesto this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   It also ends the competition, which began Friday, and now students
from 51 California schools await today's announcement of the winners.
The highest scorers from the top two divisions will compete at the
U.S. Academic Decathlon next month in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, El Camino Real, the defending national champion from
Woodland Hills, tied for first in the Super Quiz with Fresno County's
Edison High School. Two months earlier, Los Angeles High beat El
Camino in the Super Quiz at the Los Angeles Unified School District
Academic Decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising,'' said Daren Battaglia, one of El Camino's nine
decathletes. "I didn't think we'd come in first. It was thought to be
impossible to beat L.A. High."</TE>
<TE>   El Camino coach Melinda Owen said the victory gives her team a
psychological boost. "We usually don't win the Super Quiz, but the
team has been working really hard," she said. "It will keep our
spirits up tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Quiz is the only part of the decathlon that is watched
by the public.</TE>
<TE>   The students spent the last day and a half being tested behind
closed doors. And so the throng of supporters holding banners and
cheering in a high school gym served as a climatic finish to a
sometimes overwhelming few days.</TE>
<TE>   "It really boosts your morale," said El Camino's Dani Yomtov, who
was so nervous that he was tapping his feet, swaying back and forth
in his chair, rubbing his eyes and pulling his hair. "Relative to
yesterday, I'm a lot better. It's my nerves."</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Ksendz, a decathlete from L.A. High with a shaved head and
bushy goatee, stood out in the crowd of studious-looking contestants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only public portion," he said. "For morale, it means
much more than 4%. You can show people what you're about."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Quiz is done in two parts: written and oral. The subject
of this year's questioning was the Internet. The written portion was
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's oral quiz was an almost ritualistic process with many
rules. After a proctor read one of the 10 questions to the first
group of students, contestants had seven seconds to mark the answer.
They then raised their pencils and were graded on the spot. Another
proctor then held up a placard displaying how many on the team got
the answer right, which elicited a roar from the spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District sent nine teams to the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield High School and Los Angeles High tied for second in the
Super Quiz, followed by North Hollywood. The tallying of points will
be considered unofficial until today's awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown Saturday night where other Los Angeles-area schools
placed in the Super Quiz.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was also the day for speech and interview tests, events
that brought out business suits and ties. Some students could be seen
in tuxedos.</TE>
<TE>   Confined to a local high school near downtown Modesto, the
decathletes strolled the campus gripping test material and practicing
their speeches to pillars and walls.</TE>
<TE>   With no tests today, tonight will be a chance to unwind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably be up all night celebrating and being nervous at
the same time," said El Camino's Adam Mann. "I feel OK, but it's
going to be close."</TE>

<HD>After Mauling Verdict, Dog Owners Expect More Fear</HD>
<DH>Safety: Humans must be responsible for the training and
behavior of their animals, people say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot of growling and snapping could be heard at dog parks
Saturday--but it was mainly from humans voicing strong opinions about
the San Francisco lawyer who was found guilty of murder last week in
the fatal dog mauling of her neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   With a few exceptions, the strains of outrage went like this:</LD>
<LD>   "The verdict is right on--the people were responsible," said
Michelle German, a professional dog trainer. "As dog owners, we are
responsible for everything a dog does, how it behaves, how it
interacts with people."</LD>
<TE>   Many owners of large dogs, or dogs often perceived as dangerous,
such as pit bulls and Dobermans, said they are bracing themselves for
little public tolerance for aggressive behavior and for increased
wariness toward big breeds.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't have dogs will have fear," said Michael Levy,
62, of Laurel Canyon, owner of two mixed English bull and mastiff
breeds. The female, Beauvoir, weighs 85 pounds. The male, Spartacus,
weighs 130 pounds. "People who are already afraid of dogs will now
have tremendous fear."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like people ... are going to panic when they see me," said
Tara Moore, 31, owner of 3-year-old Kodiac, a strong brown 70-pound
Chesapeake Bay retriever. "I'm just going to be 100% committed to
keeping him on a leash at all times."</TE>
<TE>   Except at the Silver Lake Recreation Center, where Kodiac could
outrun and out-fetch nearly all of the 30 or so in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The few highly popular dog parks throughout the region attract
owners who want their pets to run free, and, as they like to say,
"socialize" with other pooches.</TE>
<TE>   Much as children do at regular parks, the dogs play
rambunctiously: running, rolling and, at times, fighting. The owners,
acting like parents of human children, sip coffee and chat with one
another on benches, while keeping one keen eye on their pets romping
in the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   At dog parks Saturday from Laurel Canyon to Silver Lake to Laguna
Beach, talk turned from flea infestations and training schools to the
ramifications of the verdicts in the widely watched trial. The case
represents the first time in California that a dog owner has been
convicted of murder for a mauling.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel bad at all for those dog owners or their dogs," said
Claudia Bennett of Mount Washington, who owns four dogs that she
rescued from death at animal shelters. "The general rule is, dogs are
what the owners make them."</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie Knoller, whose two 100-pound Presa Canario dogs attacked
and killed 33-year-old Diane Whipple in a hall of their Pacific
Heights apartment building, was found guilty of second-degree murder
and could serve 15 years to life in prison. Her husband, Robert Noel,
was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and faces a possible four
years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said the owners were clearly responsible for the attack.
The case included testimony that linked the defendants to two members
of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, who authorities said ran an
illegal dog-breeding operation. The dogs were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Like other dog lovers, Richard Wennerberg, 42, a Laguna Beach dog
sitter, said the case was an aberration that spoke more about Knoller
and Noel than the dogs they owned.</TE>
<TE>   He was at a park with his dog Saint, a 4-year-old Labrador and
German shepherd mix, and guard dog Brutus, a muscular 6-year-old
Rottweiler, who, he said, has never bitten anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Wennerberg doesn't believe that certain breeds are inherently
vicious. The breeds "are just names we give dogs. Those dogs were
raised by prison people," he said of Knoller's pair.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm in control, and that lady was not in control," he
said. "I'm the human, and he's the dog."</TE>
<TE>   At Laurel Canyon Dog Park, the birthplace of Los Angeles'
leash-free areas, the owner of a 120-pound mastiff said he is worried
that the case will encourage lawsuits over pets.</TE>
<TE>   "You're opening yourself up to liability, even taking your dog
with you to get a cup of coffee," he said. "If it bites someone, you
open yourself up for a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   The mastiff wandered up to a smaller, white dog, and the two
growled. The mastiff yapped at it. "You just saw a little bit of
aggression coming out," the owner said.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Van Ess owns two Akitas, both weighing about 100 pounds.
They are broad-chested dogs, known in Japan as bear hunters, with
erect ears and large heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are terrified of them," she said. "People cross the
street when they see us coming."</TE>
<TE>   Van Ess agreed with the verdict, but is concerned that in its
wake, dog owners will have a tougher time renting apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already hard for me to find an apartment," she said. Only
one dog owner, Alison McMahon Johnson, 55, of Hancock Park, whose
shepherd mix has lunged at people before, felt sorry for Knoller.</TE>
<TE>   "There was definitely no intention to murder," she said. "I mean,
she lost her dogs; she has been in jail. That is punishment
enough.... Those dogs were her babies."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said caring for her dog Fidel is "a lot of work. It's more
work than a kid. With his size, if he makes a mistake, he could
really hurt someone."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried all the time," she said. "But I work hard to make
sure that doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   The owners said that training is essential to raising a dog.</TE>
<TE>   Liesl and Mark Maggiore--who own two Rhodesian ridgeback dogs, a
breed that hunted lions in southern Africa--conceded that the pets
are capable of harming people, but the couple said they have trained
the dogs to obey. Even the slightest growl or showing of teeth is
cause for discipline, Liesl Maggiore said.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, she said, "sends a really huge message that you need
to be responsible.... It's people who give dogs a bad [reputation]."</TE>

<HD>Dog Owners Expect More Fear</HD>
<DH>Safety: Verdict in mauling case was right, say people
visiting the popular dog parks. Training called key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot of growling and snapping could be heard at dog parks
Saturday--but it was mainly from humans voicing strong opinions about
the San Francisco lawyer who was found guilty of murder last week in
the fatal dog mauling of her neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   With a few exceptions, the strains of outrage went like this:</LD>
<LD>   "The verdict is right on--the people were responsible," said
Michelle German, a professional dog trainer. "As dog owners, we are
responsible for everything a dog does, how it behaves, how it
interacts with people."</LD>
<TE>   Many owners of large dogs, or dogs often perceived as dangerous,
such as pit bulls and Dobermans, said they are bracing themselves for
little public tolerance for aggressive behavior and for increased
wariness toward big breeds.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't have dogs will have fear," said Michael Levy,
62, of Laurel Canyon, owner of two mixed English bull and mastiff
breeds. The female, Beauvoir, weighs 85 pounds. The male, Spartacus,
weighs 130 pounds. "People who are already afraid of dogs will now
have tremendous fear."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like people ... are going to panic when they see me," said
Tara Moore, 31, owner of 3-year-old Kodiac, a strong brown 70-pound
Chesapeake Bay retriever. "I'm just going to be 100% committed to
keeping him on a leash at all times."</TE>
<TE>   Except at the Silver Lake Recreation Center, where Kodiac could
outrun and out-fetch nearly all of the 30 or so in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The few highly popular dog parks throughout the region attract
owners who want their pets to run free, and, as they like to say,
"socialize" with other pooches. Much as children do at regular parks,
the dogs play rambunctiously: running, rolling and, at times,
fighting. The owners, acting like parents of children, sip coffee and
chat with one another on benches, while keeping one keen eye on their
pets romping in the dirt.</TE>

<HD>Making Ailing Kids' Pain Go Away for a Day</HD>
<DH>A man who treasures a generous gesture from his youth
spends his time and money ensuring a time to remember for chronically
ill children.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Folender was 9 when he got a lesson in giving--and he never
forgot it.</LD>
<LD>   When Folender was growing up lower-middle-class on Manhattan's
Lower East Side, his father, who sewed shirt sleeves at a garment
factory, could buy only seats with obstructed views at the circus.
''That's what he could afford," Folender said. To watch the trapeze,
"I had to sort of duck to see."</LD>
<LD>   But when he went with a rich man--the lawyer who represented his
family after Folender was hit by a car--they had "terrific" seats and
he got a toy as a souvenir.</LD>
<TE>   "It was no big deal to him," recalled Folender, 63, but it left a
lasting impression. Folender now works to create lasting memories for
chronically ill children.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Folender's Merriday Fun Club has taken
more than 600 children and medical staff to Disneyland and Universal
Studios, to Laker games and "The Lion King." He treats them like
VIPs.</TE>
<TE>   He picks them up in stretch limousines. He begins and ends theme
park trips with orders to go from McDonald's. He gives each child a
disposable camera, and even hires a UCLA film student to videotape
the day. A copy of the video goes to everyone who contributed to the
event, even the McDonald's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Folender, the former owner of Weight Watchers franchises in the
Midwest, has a realistic attitude about his mission. ''We're not the
cure for cancer,'' he said. ''We want to provide relief to children
with life-threatening diseases.''</TE>
<TE>   The Venice resident is no stranger to the world of the seriously
ill. He had quadruple-bypass surgery and cared for his late wife,
Sandie, during her 13-year fight with breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   ''As an adult, you're terrified enough'' during surgery. He
imagines it's even harder for children.</TE>
<TE>   But the stress of disease melts away when the children enter the
park, theater or arena, he said. ''Once they're on the trip, you'd
never know they're ill.'' Folender was inspired by programs for sick
children, such as tennis player Andrea Jaeger's Silver Lining Ranch
in Aspen. He had grown dissatisfied with sending money to charities
through his foundation, which he originally set up for tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   ''Writing checks seemed very hollow, very empty,'' he said. So he
started his one-man program.</TE>
<TE>   Child life specialists at the four hospitals the club serves say
the Merriday Fun Club--named after Folender's children, Merrin, 33,
and David, 37--offers youngsters the type of group activity their
illness usually prevents them from enjoying.</TE>
<TE>   The children learn from each other as well. "They realize, 'I'm
not the only sick kid in the world,'" said Rachel Hunt, child life
director at UCLA-Harbor Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter what their circumstances are, there are two rules
for the trips, according to Folender: ''Everybody goes to the
bathroom and everybody eats before we go out,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent trip, two limousines pulled up in front of UCLA-Harbor
at 8:30 a.m. The drivers arranged backpacks and Egg McMuffin
breakfasts along the curb. The kids lined up for a Folender pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is ready to have a good time?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Seven hands shot up. Four of the kids, all Latinos, spoke little
English, but when they caught the drift their hands went up too.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have a good time today," Folender said, "we're going
to do it all over again!"</TE>
<TE>   The kids put on baseball caps and T-shirts with the fun club's
smiling sun logo and piled into the limos, outfitted for the trip
with child car seats. Folender also buys tickets for medical staff
and volunteers who monitor the kids' prescription medicines and
needs. The itinerary "depends on who the kids are,'' he said. ''It
depends on their strength. We can go all night.''</TE>
<TE>   The chaperons also make accommodations for special needs. They
might brush extra salt off the French fries of a child on a
restricted diet or administer oxygen to someone with cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   "We go well prepared for those kids who may have difficulty, who
might be in need of a boost," said Linda Garcia, child life manager
at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At Disneyland, two guides met the limo with tickets, two
wheelchairs and a stroller. They know how Folender runs his trips.
The caravan of 11 kids and eight adults then marched through the
park.</TE>
<TE>   Folender said it's not important for him to learn the intimate
details of the kids' history.</TE>
<TE>   ''They know about that every day,'' he said. ''They don't have to
tell me about it.''</TE>
<TE>   One boy who kept to himself that day was Richie, whose sister
recently died. At lunch Folender saw he hadn't touched an enormous
plate of nachos.</TE>
<TE>   "Why aren't you eating?" Folender asked, putting his arm around
the 10-year-old boy. "Would you like to get something else?"</TE>
<TE>   The boy shook his head no. Folender didn't press him.</TE>
<TE>   Siblings of chronically ill children often face burdens they may
not understand, Hunt said. Itzel Rosel, 7, tends to her 17-year-old
sister, Amabilia, who, suffering from a spinal tumor, is legally
blind, very thin and barely able to walk.</TE>
<TE>   "Itzel is the baby who kind of had to lose her parents through all
of this," Hunt said. But Itzel is a "nurturing, mommy type" who
assumes responsibility for her sister.</TE>
<TE>   ''I help her put on her clothes,'' Itzel said. ''Sometimes she
wakes me up and tells me, 'Take me to the bathroom' and I do.''</TE>
<TE>   But at Disneyland, Amabilia looked out for her sister, making
Itzel keep a hand on her wheelchair. "She told me to hold her hand or
I can get lost," Itzel said.</TE>
<TE>   At day's end, Itzel, Amabilia and the other kids each got $20 in
spending money. By then the giving spirit, the same spirit Folender
experienced as a boy at the circus, became infectious.</TE>
<TE>   Richie, the boy who recently lost his sister, didn't spend all his
money on himself. He bought his mother a glittery picture frame,
decorated with Disney princesses.</TE>

<LD>While savoring their success in reviving the Belmont Learning
Complex, Los Angeles school officials have scuttled plans for another
desperately needed high school in East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Community opposition, flawed planning and public relations
blunders doomed the proposal to build a 2,000-student campus next to
Belvedere Park, the largest patch of open land in East Los Angeles,
according to those involved.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Unified School District this month pulled the plug
on the project--seven miles from Belmont--at the urging of top county
officials, who said the district failed to adequately address the
anticipated impact on traffic, parking and crime.</LD>
<TE>   But district officials pointed fingers back at the county, saying
the project died for lack of strong support from community leaders,
including Supervisor Gloria Molina, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the park-side land means the district is again
searching for sites to relieve severe crowding at Garfield and
Roosevelt high schools, which together serve more than 9,000
students. The district invested $1.9 million in the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Finding another location in East Los Angeles could force the
district to take homes in a community where affordable housing is as
scarce as parkland. The specter of ugly eminent domain proceedings
could cause still more clashes with the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to avoid taking homes, but I don't know that we can,"
said Supt. Roy Romer. "We've got to have a site for that school."</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes just as the district is emerging from a
bruising two-year debate over whether to finish or abandon Belmont,
which lies atop a former oil field near downtown. Convinced that the
school could be made safe, the school board voted earlier this month
to proceed with the costly project, which community advocates had
argued was sorely needed.</TE>
<TE>   As the district resolved one nasty conflict, however, it waded
into another.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the project was envisioned as a model of innovative
land use and cooperation between public agencies--L.A. Unified and
Los Angeles County, the park's owner.</TE>
<TE>   The school district wanted to use about half the park during the
day in exchange for improving facilities and adding basketball courts
and other amenities.</TE>
<TE>   But a determined group of residents in East Los Angeles and
Monterey Park mounted a campaign to block the project, which they
said would ruin the park.</TE>
<TE>   Their campaign gained steam last year when a consulting firm for
the district sent a letter to residents mistakenly saying the school
building would be inside the park. It actually would have been next
door.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents also got a boost from the Sierra Club, which lobbied
against the plan and paid a lawyer to review the school district's
environmental report for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said they saw the need for another high school in East
Los Angeles. But they refused to budge, recalling that the park had
already been cut in half three decades ago to make way for the Pomona
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "The community loves Belvedere Park," said Eddie Torres, an East
Los Angeles resident who led the opposition. "We're fighting for a
cause. We want to see better things happen to the community."</TE>
<TE>   County and school officials also have been feuding for months over
the project--a fight that has pitted elected officials who represent
East Los Angeles against one another.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Molina and school board member David Tokofsky have
blamed each other for the demise of the school project.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky said he supported it, but Molina apparently wavered
because of community opposition and her view that Tokofsky didn't do
enough to promote it.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Molina appeared before the Monterey Park City
Council to argue for the school. Shortly afterward, she wrote to
Tokofsky, saying she had withdrawn her support. In the Sept. 20,
letter, Molina accused Tokofsky of "passively sitting on the
sidelines" as "bureaucrats within your system ... destroyed any
effort toward community consensus."</TE>
<TE>   After Tokofsky publicly questioned Molina's commitment to building
schools in the area, she sent another letter, calling Tokofsky "the
sorry sap who objects to every opportunity to build schools in your
own district."</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky said in an interview that he had worked behind the scenes
to muster support for the school.</TE>
<TE>   A Molina spokesman said the letters to Tokofsky were written out
of frustration. He insisted that Molina never really withdrew her
support from the project, and that her letters were an attempt to
prompt action by the district.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Molina asked a team of county officials to review the
school district's environmental report on the project. That team said
the district failed to adequately gauge the effect on traffic,
parking and public safety.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the environmental report said the project would have
no significant impact on police services. But the Sheriff's
Department said it expected more vandalism, thefts and gang activity
with the influx of students.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some major issues with whether they could make that
project work at that site," said Lari Sheehan, an assistant
administrative officer who oversaw the county's review. "We didn't
think there was a quick fix."</TE>
<TE>   District officials revised their environmental study and
resubmitted it earlier this month. But it was too late. The county's
chief administrator, David Janssen, had already written to Romer,
urging him to withdraw the Belvedere site from consideration. Janssen
cited the concerns about public safety and the "mounting public
opposition" to the project.</TE>
<TE>   Some school officials privately wonder whether the county gave
their plan a fair hearing because of Molina's apparent reservations
and the public opposition. Sheehan said the team evaluated the
project on merit alone.</TE>
<TE>   With opposition coming from the county, the school district
decided to kill the project--at least for now. But district officials
say they haven't given up on the Belvedere site.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still convinced that this is going to happen sometime in the
future," said Kathi Littman, who runs the district's school
construction program.</TE>

<HD>'Memento' Makes Memories at the Independent Spirit Awards</HD>
<DH>Honors: The mystery thriller takes honors as best feature.
Spacek, Wilkinson win for 'In the Bedroom.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the year's most celebrated independent films, "In the
Bedroom," and "Memento," won honors Saturday at the 2002 Independent
Spirit Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The event was sponsored by the Independent Feature Project West, a
nonprofit organization for filmmakers, and held under a large tent on
the beach in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   What started out nearly 20 years ago as a small gathering in a
Westside restaurant to honor films not produced by the major
Hollywood studios has ballooned into a media event with fans standing
outside the roped-off area waving to the stars and calling out their
names in hopes of recognition.</LD>
<TE>   Each year the event grows larger and seemingly more mainstream:
Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke presented awards this year.</TE>
<TE>   As guests ate poached salmon and a goat cheese and lentil salad,
host John Waters reminded the audience what sets independent film
apart from mainstream studio fare. He said that every day in America,
at least one theater showing an independent film sits completely
empty, a place where "no one cares" how much work was put into making
a movie.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that without video, many independent films would never
emerge as underground favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "A few kids in the sticks still remember me as being their first
bad influence, and for that I have to thank video," said the director
of such cult classics as "Pink Flamingos."</TE>
<TE>   The big winners Saturday exemplify how word of mouth can still be
a powerful way to get people to see movies. Both "Memento" and "In
the Bedroom" were small movies that at first were shown only in a few
theaters, but eventually gained a broad audience thanks to positive
reviews and strong word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "Memento," a mystery thriller about a man whose memory is erased
by a traumatic event, worked its way backward with a difficult plot
structure that was so unconventional all studios passed on it.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's best feature film win was a sweet reward for the
movie's producers, two sisters from the San Fernando Valley, Jennifer
and Suzanne Todd.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a film we were so proud of, and nobody wanted to
distribute," said Suzanne, adding: "You should follow your dreams and
follow your passions. Like Jen and I, you could be two little sisters
from the Valley and have some of your dreams come true."</TE>
<TE>   The movie also won best screenplay and best director for
Christopher Nolan and best supporting female for Carrie-Anne Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan said that without a big distributor or a big-money marketing
campaign behind the movie, he was extremely grateful to film lovers
who made it successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Our film, perhaps more than any other, benefited from people's
willingness to see something a little different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   'In the Bedroom' Wins Top Acting Awards</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bedroom," a little-known film when it debuted at the
Sundance Film Festival last year, also won several awards.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, which has received Academy Award nominations for best
film, best actress for Sissy Spacek, best actor for Tom Wilkinson and
best supporting actress for Marisa Tomei, was eventually distributed
by Miramax at Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   The film won best first feature Saturday for actor-turned-director
Todd Field. Set in a small New England town, it is a drama about a
family that slowly disintegrates after suffering a tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the tendency for independent films to be a little on
the dark and heavy side, Field said his movie was a "very, very hard
film to get made.... It's not a terribly sexy film.... Getting your
first film made is like trying to climb Mt. Everest with three pickup
trucks on your back."</TE>
<TE>   Spacek won best female lead for her performance in the movie. The
veteran actress, who received an Academy Award in 1981 for "Coal
Miner's Daughter," said she was thrilled to return to the independent
film world, where she began her career.</TE>
<TE>   "This picture was really like coming home," she said. "I want to
say to all of you independent filmmakers out there, it's not the size
of the dog in the fight that matters but the size of the fight in the
dog."</TE>
<TE>   Her co-star and winner of best male lead, Wilkinson said Saturday
that the award made the weekend memorable. "Anything that happens
[today at the Oscars] will be an anticlimax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Buscemi won for best supporting male in "Ghost World." Best
first screenplay went to the writers of "Ghost World," Daniel Clowes
and Terry Zwigoff.</TE>
<TE>   The John Cassavetes award for best feature made for less than
$500,000 went to brothers Michael and Mark Polish for "Jackpot." Paul
Franklin Dano received the best debut performance award for "L.I.E."</TE>
<TE>   Best foreign film went to France's "Amelie," which is also
nominated for several Oscars, including best foreign language film.
"Dogtown and z-boys" won for best documentary, and the Truer than
Fiction award for the most notable emerging director was presented to
Monteith McCollum for "Hybrid."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Deming won best cinematography for David Lynch's "Mulholland
Drive." The producers award went to Rene Bastian and Linda Moran, who
produced "Martin and Orloff" and "L.I.E."</TE>
<TE>   Debra Eisenstadt received the Someone to Watch award for
up-and-coming directors for "Daydream Believer."</TE>

<HD>New Bids to Reform Campaign Finance</HD>
<DH>Elections: Bills would curb contributions by insurance
industry and independent political committees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Emboldened by the passage of federal campaign finance
reform, state lawmakers and consumer groups have renewed efforts to
toughen California's laws by curbing contributions to the insurance
commissioner and cracking down on misleading advertising.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) is sponsoring new
legislation that would prohibit insurance companies from contributing
to the incumbent insurance commissioner or any candidates for the
job. Her bill would allow individual contributions from insurance
agents and company officers and directors but limit them to $500.</LD>
<LD>   As an outgrowth of the scandal that forced former Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush from office in 2000, the bill would
make the next commissioner subject to impeachment if he repeatedly
violated the ban.</LD>
<TE>   In the Assembly, a 20-year veteran has introduced a bill that
would prohibit independent political committees from financing
campaign advertising that contained a false endorsement of a
candidate. Violators would be subject to a $1-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae) proposed the bill two weeks
after his daughter, Gina, lost her quest for his seat in the March 5
Democratic primary. Papan said advertisements by an independent
committee of trial attorneys had falsely claimed that his daughter's
opponent, South San Francisco Mayor Gene Mullin, had been endorsed by
the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   But Papan insisted his daughter's defeat had nothing to do with
his decision to push for a change in the law. "That's not the case at
all," he said. "I'm more interested in the whole process."</TE>
<TE>   Speier predicted that lawmakers will be more receptive this year
to campaign finance reform, which has traditionally faced an uphill
battle in the Legislature. The passage of major federal legislation,
she said, has put pressure on states to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   She said her bill will also be assisted by voters' rejection on
March 5 of a candidate for insurance commissioner who was heavily
financed by the industry, Democratic Assemblyman Tom Calderon of
Montebello.</TE>
<TE>   "The last election showed us the industry is willing to spend
whatever it takes to put one of its own in office," Speier said.
"This practice must end. California consumers must be assured that
the office of insurance commissioner is not for sale to the highest
bidder."</TE>
<TE>   In the primary, Calderon collected $1.5 million from insurance
interests and was the only candidate who agreed to take their money.
He finished third among Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Speier's bill, SB 1978, immediately became an issue in the general
election race for insurance commissioner. Both the Democratic and
Republican candidates hurriedly went on record in support of the ban
on contributions.</TE>
<TE>   John Garamendi, the Democratic candidate and the state's first
elected insurance commissioner, appeared with Speier at a news
conference Thursday to endorse her proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Mendoza, the Republican candidate, issued a statement calling
for legislation that would not only prohibit contributions from the
insurance industry but also from personal injury lawyers who sue the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to remove any taint of impropriety from the
decision-making process at the Department of Insurance," Mendoza
said.</TE>
<TE>   Papan said his measure would also help clean up elections by
restricting the actions of independent expenditure committees.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike campaign committees controlled by candidates, independent
committees are now unrestricted in the sums they can pour into a
campaign and, in many cases, are not required to publicly disclose
their expenditures until long after the election. Papan singled out
trial lawyers and organized labor as two special interests that ran
high-spending independent "shadow" campaigns during the March 5
primary.</TE>

<HD>Snowpack Eases Strain at Klamath</HD>
<DH>Water: There should be enough for farmers, fish this year.
TBut he challenge remains to find a long-term solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One year after an epic drought slashed water to farmers in the
Klamath Basin and sparked a fierce fight over the protection of
endangered species, Mother Nature has fashioned a short-term truce of
sorts.</LD>
<LD>   The snowpack that supplies water to the broad, flat basin
straddling the Oregon-California border stands at more than 120% of
normal. On the eve of a new planting season, there should be enough
to go around for farmers and endangered salmon and suckerfish.</LD>
<LD>   Those prospects may ease tempers enough to allow the warring
factions--salmon fishermen, environmentalists and Native American
tribes pitted against farmers--enough elbow room to craft a long-term
fix.</LD>
<TE>   "There's still plenty of heat and plenty of passion, but there's
also plenty of water," said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast
Federation of Fishermen's Assns. "This is the year to solve these
problems."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't figure to be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists already are miffed that the head gates of A
Canal, site of last summer's most heated showdowns, are set to be
cranked open Friday, even though federal wildlife agencies have not
completed biological studies of a proposed 10-year operating plan.
Environmentalists say they're taking a wait-and-see attitude, but
farmers fear that a lawsuit is being planned to block their
irrigation water.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be surprised if the day after water flows, an
environmentalist lawsuit hits," said Bob Gasser, a fertilizer dealer
in Merrill, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, lawmakers in Congress seem headed toward a showdown
over a proposed $175-million package to fix problems that have
bedeviled the basin for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The money for Klamath is included in a multibillion-dollar omnibus
farm bill being negotiated by a Senate-House conference committee.
With a war on terrorism continuing and the federal budget looking
increasingly tight, the possibility remains that Klamath's share
could be sliced.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it survives, two Oregon lawmakers are wrangling over how
it should be spent.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wants money to restore wildlife habitat
and retire farmland, reducing water demand. Rep. Greg Walden
(R-Ore.), who represents the region and has been a ready ally to the
farmers, wants agriculture to be ensured irrigation water as part of
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Todd True, an attorney with EarthJustice, said Walden seems bent
on "locking up water for irrigation and shutting out the fish and
environment." Farmers such as Bill Kennedy, meanwhile, rue Wyden's
approach. "There are other ways to reduce demand without permanently
retiring productive Klamath Basin farms and ranches," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which last year had the Klamath mess
explode shortly after the president took office, has now entered the
fray in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   On March 2, Bush established a Cabinet-level panel to help resolve
conflicts in the Klamath area. Last week, Interior Secretary Gale
Norton opened negotiations aimed at the possible return of ancestral
lands to the Klamath tribes, which could ease long-simmering
divisions between the government and the landless band of Native
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Even with prospects bright for full irrigation deliveries this
year, farmers say they're still hurting.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's unplanted fields and huge financial losses, many
are having trouble getting bank loans to pay for this year's seed,
machinery and labor costs. Gasser said he would normally have a dozen
machines out in the fields spreading fertilizer and spraying
chemicals. Right now he has two in use.</TE>
<TE>   Some banks won't make loans until the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,
which runs the sprawling system of dams and canals, provides
guarantees that the water will flow. Even then, some farmers have
been deemed loan risks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got major, major problems," Gasser said. "A lot of
people are not loanable, their debts got so big."</TE>
<TE>   Divisions between various factions within the farm community also
persist. Some farmers have been pushing in recent years to sell out,
while other groups believe that farming in the region can't shrink
any further or the area will lose the critical mass of tractor
dealers, fertilizer salesmen and seed distributors that keeps things
running.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a nasty crisis, and there's still tension," said Dan
Keppen, executive director of the Klamath Water Users Assn. "Getting
water and getting folks farming will help alleviate some of that
tension, take some of the sting out of last year."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the Bureau of Reclamation has in recent days declared
its intent to let the water start flowing, even though important
reviews of endangered species remain unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   Federal wildlife agencies have about four months to conduct an
endangered species review. But the bureau didn't finalize its plans
until late February, putting the wildlife agencies in a pinch to
deliver in half the allotted time.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service threw up its hands,
announcing that it would not have a biological opinion completed
until early June, long after farmers historically plant their crops.
Meanwhile, top Interior Department officials made it clear that they
weren't going to let statutory roadblocks keep water from farmers.</TE>

<HD>Low-Profile Luxury Is Theme as 1,500 Limos Head for the
Oscars</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bivouacked in a Van Nuys jet hangar, the son of Menachem Begin's
personal security agent is carefully choreographing the arrival of 50
actors, producers and executives to Los Angeles for the Academy
Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Zeke Unger's World Transportation Group will send
ballistic-resistant limousines door-to-door to Oscars guests around
the world. He'll charter their jets, track their flights, assign
bodyguards and scrutinize security conditions in countries that may
have been snubbed for membership in the Evil Axis--but they're still
on his A-list.</LD>
<LD>   Take the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not that confident with security in this country. When the
World Trade towers were hit, they used our own aircraft," said Unger,
who is on call to his clients 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where actors have been known to hang out too late, drive
too fast, go home with people they barely know and run on heavy,
heavy fuel--today could be the safest night of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Unger operates a worldwide, high-security version of one of the
dozens of limousine services that will send as many as 1,500 luxury
vehicles to the Kodak Theatre tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscars ceremony has created a limousine state of emergency,
and so overtaxed Los Angeles' capacity that reinforcements are coming
in from as far away as San Diego, Santa Barbara and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   And if haute Los Angeles seems suspended in a permanent Gilded
Age, flashy cars are out of favor. This year, less is more.</TE>
<TE>   "The norm has changed. Most of your execs and movie star people
would prefer a lower-profile vehicle like a sedan or a town car,"
said Norm Kinard, director of special events at Valet Parking
Service, the limousine coordinator for the Oscars. "That's a new
phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   "With everything that's happened," Kinard said--everything being
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--the car of choice is "lower-profile
and a lot more inconspicuous."</TE>
<TE>   Sixty percent of limousines nationwide are white, but at the
Oscars, most movie executives want their clients to be seen stepping
out of black cars. Lower-ranking invitees, Kinard said, tend to want
the splashiest limousines they can get. There's a broad range:
Limousine is a loose term for anything from a luxury sedan to a sport
utility vehicle or a 12-passenger stretch vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   At the high end are the limousines made by American Custom
Coachworks of Beverly Hills, whose limos with a 120-inch stretch will
be among the Oscars coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The seat section becomes a bed, and "if the stars want to relax,
take it easy, they can lie down," said Oscar Meyer, the company's
vice president.</TE>
<TE>   The cars have ice and champagne compartments, bars, CD and DVD
players, "even mirrored ceilings with over 200 star lights that
change to six different colors," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Those can cost up to $85,000. There are even 130-inch-stretch
limos with things like hot tubs, aquariums, fog machines and karaoke.
But they won't be at the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "Your average Joe," limousine coordinator Kinard said, "may show
up in a six- or 12-passenger limousine, a stretch vehicle with all of
the amenities, television and wet bar."</TE>
<TE>   And they'll be in good company. Limousines, once associated with
funerals, are so wedded to Hollywood and the Oscars that Lincoln took
out a 20-page spread in Vanity Fair to trumpet itself as the
"Official Luxury Vehicle of Campaign Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities--Martin Sheen and Allison Janney of "The West Wing"
and rocker Richie Sambora--posed with Lincolns for splashy
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Uber agent Pat Kingsley said her clients will ride in Cadillacs:
General Motors has a corporate relationship with the parent company
of Kingsley's agency.</TE>
<TE>   Because cars, like stars, are commodities.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadillac A-list includes Robert Altman, Helen Mirren, Uma
Thurman, Helen Hunt and Kirsten Dunst, Kingsley said. Gwyneth Paltrow
and Russell Crowe will ride in Cadillac Escalades, an SUV, rather
than traditional limousines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a courtesy thing of making these limos available, because we
always run short this time of year anyway," Kingsley said. "Some
people, like me, get nauseous in limousines. They sway a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kish was the limousine driver for an Oscar nominee, David
Franzoni, the lead screenwriter of "Gladiator," at last year's
Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to the Shrine Auditorium, Franzoni told Kish about
going on location, from Morocco to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a gentleman, from start to finish," Kish said. "You'd
never know he was one of these Hollywood guys."</TE>
<TE>   Franzoni and his wife walked to the Governor's Ball. When Kish
picked him up, Franzoni was psyched, even though he had not won the
screenwriting Oscar; "Gladiator" had won Best Picture.</TE>
<TE>   They hit the party trail. There was the Vanity Fair bash at
Morton's. The rest was a blur.</TE>
<TE>   "The last one, it was a zoo when he came out," Kish said. "He got
in the car and he said, 'I'm too old for these parties. I'm ready to
go home.'"</TE>
<TE>   Home turned out to be a long drive to deep Malibu. Franzoni tipped
him $60.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept asking me if I was all right," Kish said. "I've had a
couple of idiots. So it was a breath of fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of limo companies will talk, sotto voce, about which movie
stars they drive around, about how they have sex and do drugs in the
back seat.</TE>
<TE>   Not Zeke Unger. He's in the Rolodex of prominent Hollywood
executives--but he won't tell you the names of any of those he is
sending to the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   As far as he's concerned, his drive-and-tell competitors are "just
prostitutes. To make a dollar, they're willing to prostitute their
clients' security."</TE>
<TE>   Unger's is among the handful of companies that have gotten
permission to park their limousines away from the herd to be
corralled at the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Kaplan, of Ace Limousine Service in Santa Monica, said he
had to submit his drivers' names to the FBI for approval. He was told
the drivers can expect the cars to be searched with bomb-sniffing
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this for 18 years, and this is the first time
that security has been so tight," Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   The limousine tracking system at the Oscars is about as democratic
as Hollywood gets.</TE>
<TE>   Limousines arriving at the Kodak Theatre will be met on the street
by greeters, who will present the celebrity with a ticket. The
drivers will get a package with a meal ticket and head off to the
Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   When celebrities emerge from the awards, they will present their
tickets at the callback table. Greeters will call the Hollywood Bowl,
the ticket number is announced over the public address system, and
the driver hustles off to the Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   A lot can happen in the back seat of a limousine. So, for
chauffeurs a typical protocol is: Ignore it. Even if they end up
cleaning the cars with plastic gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Limousine drivers have limits. They're sometimes asked to perform
services they're not supposed to, such as procuring women. One driver
said he almost stopped the car to kick out an obnoxious DreamWorks
executive on his way to the Grammys last year.</TE>
<TE>   All this for between $11 and $14 an hour. Plus gratuities.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, it's a good tip that night, because it's a very
prestigious night, an exciting night," said Kaplan of Ace Limousine.
"The people in the car know that they are very obligated to tip this
evening. It's common to get a $100 tip."</TE>
<TE>   But, as Richard Scott, senior manager of Westside Limousine
Service, notes, "the winners tip better than the losers."</TE>
<TE>   That jibes with the experience of limousine driver Kish, who is a
retired officer of the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he drove to the Screen Actors Guild awards with one of
the main actors in a nominated film.</TE>
<TE>   The first setback was some glitter left in the car by a woman. It
got all over the actor. And he got all upset. "It was ridiculous,"
Kish said. "But the lint brush seemed to pacify him."</TE>
<TE>   The actor was in the running for an outstanding cast award with
others in his film. But the cast of another movie won. So this star
left early and went straight home, Kish said. "He was all bummed. He
got on the phone with his wife and was all boo-hooing about losing,"
Kish said. "I said, 'Hey, there'll be other times. That's life.'</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't tip me a dime," Kish said. Two weeks later, Kish said,
the actor was on a magazine cover.</TE>
<TE>   When Kish was invited to drive for the Oscars this year, he
declined.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they really get the big picture," Kish concluded.
"There are so many better things they could be doing with their 15
minutes of fame."</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Lobbyists Woo State</HD>
<DH>Influence: Developer of the controversial housing project
has spent $284,000 since 1999 on some of California's best-connected
firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As opponents of Ahmanson Ranch seek to rally the public to their
side, the developer behind the $2-billion housing project that would
be built at Ventura County's eastern edge is working to enlist
support from state officials who could help decide its fate.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1999, when a rare plant and frog were discovered on the
property, the Ahmanson Land Co. and corporate parent Washington
Mutual Bank based in Seattle have spent more than $284,000 on some of
the best-connected lobbyists in California.</LD>
<LD>   The developer has courted regulatory agencies, the state treasurer
and the governor's office to block efforts that would snag the
3,050-home project, located in the rugged Simi Hills near the Los
Angeles County line.</LD>
<TE>   State Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who has campaigned
against the development, says she has been impressed with Ahmanson's
response at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   "They shift gears depending on where they see the problems. That's
good lobbying," Kuehl said. "Whether it's going to be successful in
the long run, I'm not sure. We're seriously in for the long haul in
opposition."</TE>
<TE>   The developer's lobbying force includes Platinum Advisors, whose
chief, Darius Anderson, is a top fund-raiser for Gov. Gray Davis. The
firm has counted Microsoft, Walt Disney Co. and Pacific Gas and
Electric among its clients.</TE>
<TE>   State records show that earlier this month, Washington Mutual also
hired another powerful lobbying firm, Nielsen, Merksamer, Parrinello,
Mueller and Naylor. Steven Merksamer was chief of staff to former
Gov. George Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson spokesman Tim McGarry, however, said Merksamer's firm was
retained for banking issues "totally unrelated" to the housing
development.</TE>
<TE>   Records indicate that the developer's lobbyists have adapted to
keep up with obstacles thrown in the project's path by a growing
opposition force, which now includes everyone from state legislators
to Hollywood celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 and 2000, the focus of lobbyists was to convince the
Department of Fish and Game that the Ahmanson Ranch developer had
sufficient plans to protect the San Fernando Valley spineflower, once
believed extinct, and the California red-legged frog.</TE>
<TE>   "We actively sought their input on the kinds of conservation plans
that would do the job," McGarry said. "We certainly sought to
understand the expectations of Fish and Game as to what would be
effective in protecting these species."</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists also spent time with California Department of
Transportation officials, who were pushing for an updated traffic
study. The development is expected to dump 45,000 cars a day onto
local streets and the Ventura Freeway, with most of that traffic
pouring into neighboring Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen lawsuits have since stalled the project, and
detractors have argued that gridlock would be even worse than
projected.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura County planners agreed with the developers that a new
study was not needed, and Caltrans withdrew its request last year.</TE>
<TE>   By 2001, Los Angeles County politicians were standing strong in
their opposition to the project, frustrated that Ventura County would
reap the tax benefits while Los Angeles would suffer increased
traffic and smog. A delegation lobbied Davis' office against the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the environmental group Heal the Bay and the
conservation group Save Open Space solicited help from Hollywood.
Director Rob Reiner and HBO executive Chris Albrecht launched Rally
to Save Ahmanson Ranch and solicited the help of actor Martin Sheen
and others.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl, Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) and the city of
Calabasas continued applying pressure at Caltrans and the Department
of Fish and Game to deflect arguments put forth by the developer,
Kuehl said.</TE>
<TE>   State records show that Ahmanson lobbyists have spoken with
officials in the governor's office to discourage the administration
from becoming involved in what they maintain is a local land-use
issue. And lobbying firm Robinson and Associates was asked to track
every environmental bill moving through the state Legislature for any
language that might threaten the Ahmanson Ranch development.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be where your opponents are," said McGarry, spokesman
for the developer. "And our opponents have been very active in
Sacramento. We've been in the position of responding to questions
raised by the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Guy Gniadek, project manager and vice president of
Ahmanson Land Co., has met with state Treasurer Phil Angelides.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said Gniadek told Angelides that the Ahmanson Ranch
project is a good example of so-called "smart growth," with its mix
of affordable and luxury homes, its plans for commuter van pools and
its large dedications of open space.</TE>
<TE>   Since the discovery of the spineflower and frog, project opponents
have sought state bond money to buy the Ahmanson Ranch land and
protect it against development. California voters approved a
$2.6-billion bond measure this month that could help buy the ranch
property.</TE>
<TE>   The developer maintains that the land is not for sale and is
moving forward with plans to break ground next year, provided that
Ventura County supervisors approve a supplemental environmental
impact report this fall.</TE>
<TE>   As treasurer, Angelides has discretion over tax credit programs as
well as general bond money that can be used to buy park land. But
McGarry says that's not why Gniadek went to see him.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, we have not discussed with Angelides parks bonds
or tax credits related to Ahmanson Ranch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent conversation with Ahmanson lobbyist Darius Anderson
made Kuehl wonder whether the developer is warming to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, I saw Darius and in passing he said, 'Well, I wonder if
the state is prepared to buy this property,'" Kuehl said.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Of course the state is prepared to buy the property. We
don't have the money in hand yet. But we'd need a willing seller.' He
said, 'Well, it would be very expensive.' He smiled, and I smiled,
and that was it.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't, in my opinion, constitute a real offer, or even a
trial balloon," Kuehl said. "But it's one of those informal exchanges
that tests the other person's attitudes."</TE>

<HD>A Beautiful Whine Over Story of Nash's Genius</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood community is aghast, we are told.</LD>
<LD>   In their lust for Oscars, movie execs have hit new lows,
shamelessly promoting their own movies while unscrupulously smearing
the competition and spending obscene piles of cash to influence
judges.</LD>
<LD>   I'm shocked too. I'm shocked anyone is surprised.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the cat fighting, as you know, has centered on criticism
of "A Beautiful Mind," which may win the Oscar for best picture
tonight. Critics say the movie, based on Nobel Prize-winning
mathematician John Nash, ignored unflattering aspects of his life.</TE>
<TE>   I see it entirely differently. My problem is that the movie
ignored a flattering aspect of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the theater, I was hesitant to broach the subject with my
wife, who is much smarter than I am. The explanation of Nash's
heralded achievement must have sailed right over my head, and surely
she'd call me a dope for missing it. But I had to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have any idea what this guy did to win a Nobel Prize?" I
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a clue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now look, I understand it's just a Hollywood movie, and I
certainly didn't expect to leave the Cineplex with a PhD. But if
you're going to call a movie "A Beautiful Mind," why treat viewers
like airheads?</TE>
<TE>   If Nash, a schizophrenic, hadn't won the Nobel Prize, there
wouldn't have been a movie. So couldn't Universal Pictures take a
minute or two, somewhere in the film, to let us in on what Nash did?</TE>
<TE>   "It's even worse than that," says Bart Kosko, a professor of
electrical engineering at USC. "To the extent that they did try to
explain it, they got it wrong."</TE>
<TE>   I called Kosko because he had written a commentary on the movie
for The Times. In the scene he's talking about, the Nash character,
played by Russell Crowe, is in a bar with his pals, and they're all
aflutter over a lone blond in the company of several brunets.</TE>
<TE>   A lightbulb flashes for Crowe. He tells his pals they should
forget the blond and go after the brunets, or they'll all sleep
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Let me tell you something. If that were such a smart move, I'd
have a few Nobel Prizes on my wall too.</TE>
<TE>   With Kosko's help and a bit of my own research, I learned that
Nash's 1950 breakthrough was to advance "game theory," and to this
day his insight is used in economic strategizing.</TE>
<TE>   The Nash equilibrium is the point at which no player would alter
his own strategy given what the other players are doing, because
there's no incentive to do so.</TE>
<TE>   But in the movie bar scene, there would be an incentive to alter
the strategy. If each guy ended up with a brunet, and the neglected
blond started batting her eyelashes, the result could be a brawl.
This might give us a Hank Williams song, but not a Nash equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Hank Williams shouldn't have won a Nobel Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Nash's theory has influenced everything from the arms race to the
varying prices you pay for a banana at Costco, Ralphs and the corner
grocery.</TE>
<TE>   So why couldn't the movie, especially one up for best picture,
trust our intelligence enough to tell us this?</TE>
<TE>   When a Universal publicist heard I was writing about "A Beautiful
Mind," she called to see if she could help with anything.</TE>
<TE>   Did you see the movie? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then tell me what the Nash equilibrium is.</TE>
<TE>   She paused.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to let you put me on the spot like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   David Bayer, a Barnard College mathematician, was Crowe's "hand
double" for the math equations that were scribbled on walls and
windows in the movie. I'd read a story that said Bayer was also a
consultant to director Ron Howard, so I called him.</TE>
<TE>   "Ron always made it clear this was not a math lesson, it was a
love story," said Bayer.</TE>
<TE>   Well, fine, but I wasn't looking for a math lesson. A brief
explanation of the man's genius would have been enough for me, and it
would have made the movie better.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer said he and Howard "talked at great lengths" about the Nash
equilibrium. But Howard was more interested in conveying the
emotional intensity of a mathematician, along with an exploration of
schizophrenia. Bayer, who loved the movie, thought Howard made all
the right moves.</TE>
<TE>   The scene with the blond and brunets wasn't intended as an
explanation of the Nash equilibrium, Bayer says. It was to be seen as
the genesis of his breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Well, how were we supposed to know? And how could it have meant
anything if we never learned what the breakthrough was?</TE>
<TE>   Late in the movie, Nash is honored by his colleagues at Princeton
University. The filmmakers could have added a scene--30 seconds would
have done it--in which other mathematicians explained the Nash
equilibrium in the moments before Nash walked into the reception.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer, who played one of the professors in the room, loved my
idea. But it wouldn't have been historically accurate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Something tells me that wouldn't have been a problem.</TE>

<HD>Airman Remembered as a Hero</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: About 150 people attend a service for Jason
Cunningham, who died while treating wounded comrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sobered after his first combat rescue mission in Afghanistan, Senior
Airman Jason Cunningham wrote his wife a letter, preparing her for
the worst.</LD>
<LD>   He apologized for not always being the best husband and for the
hardships she would face if he died.</LD>
<LD>   "I could not leave this earth without saying goodbye to you. I
will miss you and the girls immensely," wrote Cunningham, who was
killed three weeks ago in a firefight on a frozen Afghan
mountainside. "Even though I wasn't always the best husband, you have
always been the best wife. I want you to know I died a happy man,
happy that I met you and happy that I have two wonderful girls."</LD>
<TE>   In a shaky voice, his wife, Theresa, read that letter aloud
Saturday during a memorial service for Cunningham at St. Mary
Magdalene Church in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the face of danger, he was still thinking about us," she
said. "I keep looking for a reason why. Why? We were really happy. We
had two children. Was this his time? Was it his destiny? We don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   About 150 people turned out for a memorial Mass in honor of
Cunningham, who was buried in Arlington National Cemetery last week.
Raised in Carlsbad, N.M., the 26-year-old considered Camarillo his
home. His wife was born and raised there, and the two hoped to live
there someday.</TE>
<TE>   A portrait of the blue-eyed Cunningham, a member of an elite Air
Force combat search and rescue unit, was in front of the altar. His
commanding officer attended, and Msgr. John Hughes came out of
retirement to perform the service.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to celebrate the conclusion of a brief but full life,"
Hughes said. "The death of a young man in the prime of his life is
one of the mysteries we don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, based at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., was
one of eight soldiers from three services killed during an assault on
an 11,000-foot-high mountain redoubt near the town of Gardez in
eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Vincent Savino, commander of the Air Force's 38th Rescue
Squadron that Cunningham was attached to, gave new details of the
engagement that became America's bloodiest battle to date in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham was part of a quick-reaction force sent to rescue a
group of soldiers pinned down by heavy machine-gun and rocket fire on
a mountain slope. One helicopter had already been shot down when
Cunningham's unit flew in aboard another.</TE>
<TE>   "They went in under heavy machine-gun fire. The helicopter was hit
by a rocket and crash-landed," Savino told the hushed church. "The
pilot and co-pilot were wounded. Some of the Rangers on board had
been shot."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, a paramedic, opened his rucksack and began treating
the wounded. But the flames and smoke from the burning MH-47
helicopter forced him and another rescuer to move the wounded
soldiers outside. As they maneuvered over the rocky terrain, gunfire
and mortar shells rained down from entrenched Al Qaeda and Taliban
positions above.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason said they had to get these guys out of there. He ran across
a direct line of fire to move the wounded men to another location,"
Savino said.</TE>
<TE>   He helped move the wounded three times to shield them from enemy
fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason was going back and forth treating his wounded comrades when
he was shot," Savino said. "He was shot but he continued to treat 10
wounded patients. They owe him their lives. The only reason they came
home was because of Jason Cunningham. It doesn't make it easier
saying he died doing what he loved or that he was a hero, but that's
what he was."</TE>
<TE>   Another Californian, U.S. Navy SEAL Neil Roberts of Woodland, also
died in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Before the battle of March 4 and 5, Cunningham had helped rescue
eight crew members aboard a C-130 transport plane that had crashed in
Afghanistan. He wrote his wife the letter she had earlier read after
that experience.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd seen the dangers of what happened there and he was afraid,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   A month before his deployment in Afghanistan, Cunningham and his
wife saw the film "Black Hawk Down" about a fierce battle between
U.S. Army Rangers and Somali gunmen in Mogadishu.</TE>
<TE>   She asked him why it was necessary for 10 men to go back to save
one or retrieve a dead comrade.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Wouldn't you want someone to come after me? Those
Rangers and pilots can do their jobs because they know someone is
coming after them,'" she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham also is survived by his parents in New Mexico and his
daughters--2-year-old Hannah and 4-year-old Kyla.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa, 30, is a student at Valdosta State University in Georgia.
She met her husband while they were both serving in the U.S. Navy in
Naples, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   She told how baby Kyla had vomited on his face as he spun her in
the air. And how the couple never went to bed angry.</TE>
<TE>   "He would never hang up the phone without saying he loved me," she
said. "He left nothing unsaid. I hear all about how he was a great
soldier, but he was also a great man."</TE>

<HD>Black Clergy Courted by GOP</HD>
<DH>Politics: Conservatives hope to make headway among
traditionally Democratic African Americans. Many seem willing to
listen, but some remain skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seldom have black ministers been more popular. Historically wooed by
liberal politicians as conduits to African American communities, they
are now the darlings of conservatives as well.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, conservative groups have flown a delegation of
ministers, including a dozen from Los Angeles, to Washington to chat
about racial profiling with Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and hobnob with
conservative scholars at the Heritage Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   California Republican lawmakers have flown ministers of primarily
black mega-churches and community chapels, storefronts and
sanctuaries to Sacramento for ''Pastors Days'' and hosted hundreds of
them at conservative community-renewal conferences.</LD>
<TE>   A handful of Republican legislators trawl the length of the state,
stopping in Berkeley, Los Angeles and San Diego, where they preach
conservative remedies to poverty, unemployment and the spread of
AIDS. African American pastors turn out by the hundreds to hear them.</TE>
<TE>   ''Not bad, when white Republicans can come to Los Angeles, host a
meeting for 400 black pastors, and some Latinos too, without anyone
really knowing about it,'' boasts state Sen. Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe
City). ''In fact, just weeks ago I spent the night there--in the
'hood" as the guest of one minister's family.</TE>
<TE>   Many African American ministers, whose congregants voted
overwhelmingly Democratic in the 2000 presidential election, say they
are not yet converted--but make it clear they are listening.</TE>
<TE>   ''Of course I know the Republican Party has an objective and an
agenda--it's trying to win favor with the black community through the
pastors,'' said Bishop Frank Stewart of Zoe Christian Center in Los
Angeles. ''But I don't think that's negative.... They're saying some
things that are interesting to me.''</TE>
<TE>   There is deep desperation on both sides of this would-be
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Stark demographic changes make it clear that if the state
Republican Party does not diversify, it will go the way of the
dinosaur. Latinos in California supported Democrat Al Gore in 2000 by
a 2-to-1 margin. Nationally, 90% of blacks and a majority of Latinos
and Asians voted for Gore, while white men voted 62% in favor of Bush
and white women were split almost evenly.</TE>
<TE>   Courting minorities "is our No. 1 priority,'' said Pamela Mantis,
deputy director of outreach for the Republican National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   So the GOP goes on the road. Last year, the RNC held African
American outreaches in Memphis, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Arkansas,
and earlier this month hosted blacks and Latinos in Mississippi. In
mid-April, the party will hold an event targeting Haitian Americans
in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   ''The African American community has felt abandoned by our party
for the last 40 or 50 years," Mantis said, "and the other side, the
Democrats, took advantage of that.''</TE>
<TE>   The desperation on the black ministers' side is the belief by some
that they are taken for granted by the Democrats, and that liberal
solutions to urban problems have done little to improve their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Some are drawn to conservative notions like the privatization of
Social Security, President Bush's initiative to give faith-based
organizations greater access to federal funding, school vouchers and
opposition to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   ''My vote is now definitely up for grabs,'' said the Rev. James
Price of Long Beach Christian Center. Republicans ''have definitely
said things that make me listen.''</TE>
<TE>   He said he decided he favored privatizing part of Social Security,
which would allow individuals to make their own investment choices,
during the pastors' trip to the Heritage Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   ''My desire is to bring biblical truths to my congregation and
we're supposed to be good stewards of things that we have,'' he said.
''Timothy says, in Chapter 5.8, that he who does not provide for his
own and those of his household is worse than an infidel and has
denied the faith.''</TE>
<TE>   Last month, African American pastors from around the country
gathered at a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport for the
conservative Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education's annual
convention.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition is a nonprofit organization founded by black welfare
mother-turned-conservative author Star Parker, best known for her
book ''Pimps, Whores and Welfare Brats." It paints liberal Democrats
as pimps who buy off black leaders in exchange for their support of a
welfare culture. Published in 1997 with a forward by Rush Limbaugh,
the book rocketed her to national prominence in conservative circles.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, who now lives in San Clemente, says she enjoys the
Republican Party's praise but questions its support. ''Republicans,
as a party, are unwilling to acknowledge social problems regarding
race,'' Parker said. ''When I do [conservative] radio shows, racial
profiling will come up, they'll ask me: 'Well, racial profiling isn't
a big problem, is it?' And when I say 'Well, actually it is ... '
there's silence.''</TE>
<TE>   Parker organized the black ministers' visit to Washington last
year. Using donations to her nonprofit, she paid for 47 ministers
from Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and Chicago to visit Capitol
Hill. She also has organized conferences for pastors featuring
conservative stars such as Jack Kemp, Dick Armey, Newt Gingrich and
Alan Keyes.</TE>
<TE>   ''I start with pastors because they're socially conservative,''
Parker said. ''I really don't care about the politics of it all. I'm
interested in seeing my community healed.''</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Eugene P. Pack, assistant pastor at the Praise and
Worship Center in Houston, attended the coalition's conference to
learn more about Bush's faith-based initiative, which the president
hopes will allow churches with social service agencies to gain a
greater share of federal dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Pack, who with his wife runs a family assistance and crisis
pregnancy center in Houston's struggling 3rd ward, said he had long
ago embraced a conservative message and the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   ''I tell folks, if you read the platform you'll find out the
majority of you are already Republicans,'' Pack said. ''You just
don't know it.''</TE>
<TE>   Not the Rev. Johnny Hunter of North Carolina, another conference
guest. Hunter, the national director of the Life Education and
Resource Center, left the Democratic Party several years ago over its
pro-choice stand but said he simply could not become a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   ''I just can't do it,'' he said. ''There are some issues of social
justice that really need to be addressed.''</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the last time the Republican Party actively
identified with African Americans was during Abraham Lincoln's
presidency. And winning over a pastor does not necessarily mean the
flock will follow.</TE>
<TE>   Most black people--63%--say pastors are the most important leaders
in the African American community, according to the Barna Research
Group Ltd., a Ventura company that tracks cultural trends and
Christianity. Yet the African American vote is the only one in the
nation that has no correlation between high church attendance and
acceptance of the Republican Party, the research firm says.</TE>
<TE>   Among California Republican legislators, the most enthusiastic
envoys to black churches have been Leslie and Sen. Ray Haynes
(R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts began about two years ago. Senate Republican Leader
Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) hired consultant Tony Lowden, who had
worked on recruiting ministers for the Democratic Party, to launch a
similar fact-finding mission for Republicans. When Lowden returned,
he told Brulte, Haynes and Leslie the time was ripe for them to step
in.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes and Leslie say they keep their black pastor events in
Sacramento low-profile to avoid any hint of insincerity. Haynes goes
so far as to say he is not recruiting blacks for the party, merely
building relationships in minority communities and staying true to
conservative problem-solving methods.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes said he was surprised by the black churches'
industriousness. ''Those pastors are doing more with the hundreds of
dollars that they get than we're doing with millions we dump into
bureaucracies."</TE>
<TE>   Now, after their immersion in black neighborhoods, Haynes and
Leslie are conversant in a litany of services of interest to many
African Americans, from convict employment programs to mortgage
lending opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is enough to win the many ministers who continue to
view the GOP as racially hostile.</TE>
<TE>   ''They're the same people who didn't want us to come to their
schools and now they want to pray with us? I think for myself and I'm
just not hearing that,'' said the Rev. M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither of
Faith United Methodist Church in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   Gaither went on pastors' trips to Washington and Sacramento and
says he is open to a conservative solutions. But, ''I would not want
Social Security privatized. I don't think we should legislate
abortion, and then their whole approach to the economy is that
business can do no wrong. But business abuses us as much as the
government does. As for welfare reform, what about the welfare we
give to corporations?''</TE>
<TE>   David Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economics, an
organization that researches public policy issues of concern to
African Americans, said the GOP's dilemma is how to woo black
conservatives without alienating white ones .</TE>
<TE>   Even where black conservatives agree with mainstream
conservatives, they do so for different reasons, Bositis said.</TE>
<TE>   Take school vouchers. Bositis' research shows that the majority of
African Americans want school vouchers, but do so out of
''desperation,'' he said. ''Their children are going to schools that
are broken.''</TE>
<TE>   White conservatives, as often as not, would use vouchers to move
their children away from other kinds of children--such as black ones,
Bositis said. ''And those are two entirely different things.''</TE>
<TE>   Party officials recognize that an accommodation has to be reached,
if only for practical reasons. In 2000, Gore won 71% of the big-city
vote. An example was Michigan, where he narrowly won the state's
electoral votes even though Bush won most counties. The reason: Gore
took heavily black Detroit, winning 94% of the African American vote.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP does not need the majority of blacks to vote Republican,
Bositis said, just a few more. Doubling its national share to 20%
would dramatically change its fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Bositis recently sat down with party leaders, who sought his
advice about winning greater black support.</TE>
<TE>   ''I believe they really want to do it, but I told them it was
going to be a long process, hard to accomplish,'' he said. ''It's not
necessarily impossible, just extremely difficult.''</TE>

<LD>An Orange County legislator who represents the largest community of
Vietnamese outside Vietnam was stopped from visiting that country 10
hours before his trip.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, was planning a weeklong trip
to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with his brother, Michael, and an aide,
Chuyen Nguyen, to learn more about his constituents' culture, values,
history and lifestyles.</LD>
<LD>   The Vietnamese government revoked his and Nguyen's visas Thursday,
declining to explain.</LD>
<TE>   Dunn suspects it was because of his criticism of Vietnam's
treatment of Tong Ly, a Vietnamese American pilot who dropped
anti-communist leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City in 2000. Ly awaits
trial.</TE>

<HD>In Santa Ana, 2002 Is 'the Year of the Park'</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Millions are being spent to give residents in
the densely populated city new and improved places to play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G.REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana will spend $16 million this year in a massive program to
expand city parks and recreation centers, a turnaround for a densely
populated city where open space is at a premium.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the activity is a $6.2-million expansion of Delhi
Park, which will quadruple in size and will be dedicated this month.
A community center is being constructed and a soccer field will be
added to the park. "This is going to make a big difference in our
community. My children will have a safe place to play and meet their
friends," said Rosalinda Garcia, who was taking a midday walk with
her two children when she stopped to admire the soon-to-be-completed
center.</LD>
<LD>   Rosie Montanez, president of the Delhi Neighborhood Assn., said
residents keep asking her about the park's opening, scheduled April
1. "They're excited and anxious to use the park and center," Montanez
said. "Everyone in Delhi believes that this is our park and center.
It's our pride."</LD>
<TE>   Residents and city officials spent nearly a decade planning and
designing the park, at Halladay Street and Warner Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jose Solorio said it took that long to raise the
money from federal, state and local sources.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, it's been a dream in the making for over 10 years,"
Solorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Solorio, who represents the Delhi community, said the council had
the city's large youth population in mind when it voted on the park
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Youngest Median Age Among Large Cities</TE>
<TE>   With a median age of 26, Santa Ana has a population with the
youngest median age among the nation's 100 largest cities. The city,
which covers about 27 square miles, has about 40 parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked with all of the city's communities on this," Solorio
said. "One of the first things I asked for when I joined the council
was that we form a committee on park development."</TE>
<TE>   In Delhi, the city expanded a 2.5-acre park to 10 acres after a
city equipment yard was closed. Soccer fields are being added and the
27,000-square-foot community center will have a computer lab, health
clinic, dance rooms and an automotive-technology workshop.</TE>
<TE>   New parks are rare in Santa Ana because open land is tough to come
by, leaving officials with a challenge--such as squeezing Patricia
Lane Park into a 1-acre site in east Santa Ana on what was state
surplus property adjacent to the Santa Ana Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Solorio said officials are working with residents on that park's
design.</TE>
<TE>   Solorio said that "2002 is the year of the park in Santa Ana....
No other city in Orange County has committed as much money to its
neighborhood parks."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Zoo in Prentice Park is getting a $2.76-million face
lift that will include a new children's zoo with a two-story barn and
education center.</TE>
<TE>   At Centennial Park, plans call for a 15,000-square-foot skateboard
facility. The 87-acre park already includes ball fields and a
sprawling picnic area.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope to have the park improvements launched or
completed by the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>Who's to Blame for Tragic Deaths That No One Could See
Coming?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've all heard someone say, "You take a risk every time you leave
the house."</LD>
<LD>   Well, not really. The overwhelming likelihood is that if you leave
the house, you'll be back. The chance that you won't is almost off
the probability charts.</LD>
<LD>   That's what makes the recent but unrelated deaths of Brittanie
Cecil and Lori Mason-Larez so dispiriting. It also got me thinking
about risk and responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   Eight days ago, Brittanie's father took her to a National Hockey
League game in Columbus, Ohio, as a 14th birthday present. During the
game, a puck flew into the stands and struck Brittanie in the head.
She died two days later of her injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Deadly risk? At a hockey game? Virtually no such thing. The NHL
said it was the first fan fatality at one of its games.</TE>
<TE>   Now consider Mason-Larez's plight. Last September, she and family
members went to Knott's Berry Farm, but the day ended in horror when
Mason-Larez, 40, fell 115 feet to her death from the top of the
Perilous Plunge ride. She was strapped into her seat when the ride
began, but last week California state investigators said the ride's
restraints proved inadequate, especially for someone of Mason-Larez's
size, nearly 300 pounds. The family is suing.</TE>
<TE>   Deadly risk? At an amusement park? The numbers who have died are
infinitesimal as a percentage of the millions of annual riders at
America's amusement parks.</TE>
<TE>   Two deaths that shouldn't have happened, but did.</TE>
<TE>   Whose fault is it? Doesn't it have to be somebody's?</TE>
<TE>   The NHL could erect 50-foot plexiglass barriers between the ice
and the stands--and that might be enough to deflect errant pucks.</TE>
<TE>   If Brittanie's death is one too many, why not build the walls?</TE>
<TE>   The league won't do it--and shouldn't--because people go to a
hockey game to enjoy the action. For large numbers of people near the
ice, a giant pane of glass would detract from that.</TE>
<TE>   As tragically maddening as the girl's death is, reasonable people
would say that nothing could have prevented it except her seeing the
puck and ducking.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing it, Brittanie assumed a risk by going to a hockey
game.</TE>
<TE>   Is a high-speed amusement ride in the same category? In an era
when parks are revving up the thrills, do riders assume risks? Do
they bear any responsibility for deciding to hop on board?</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, you don't get on a ride--even one called Perilous
Plunge--thinking you could fall out of it. But as with all endeavors
that smack of danger--even the supposedly fun kind--you decide if you
want to play. Skydiving isn't sold as a lethal sport, either, but it
surely can be.</TE>
<TE>   The accident investigator found that Mason-Larez's seat belt was
fastened and her lap bar in place. However, neither kept her from
hurtling out of her seat near the top of the ride. The inadequate
restraints, the nature of the ride and the woman's girth most likely
all contributed to the accident, he found, but he was unable to
assess their relative roles.</TE>
<TE>   I'll ask the indelicate questions. Should the woman have realized
before the ride began that she wasn't secure in her seat? Could she
have told a ride operator?</TE>
<TE>   Or, at 300 pounds, confined to tight quarters and about to begin a
ride that had a 115-foot vertical drop at up to 55 mph, did she have
any responsibility for her own safety in deciding to try the ride?</TE>
<TE>   The investigator found nothing wrong with the equipment (for
example, the seat belt didn't snap) but concluded the restraints
weren't adequate for extremely heavy riders.</TE>
<TE>   However, the ride operator didn't caution Mason-Larez that her
size might pose a risk.</TE>
<TE>   That failure probably will cost Knott's insurance company millions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's how it should be. Perhaps the woman had no reason
to think before the ride started that it was a bad idea for someone
of her size. Perhaps she thought she was snugly strapped in.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not arguing that her family doesn't deserve a settlement from
Knott's.</TE>
<TE>   Nor am I arguing that life should be risk-free.</TE>
<TE>   I'm only saying that some risks you can't see coming, and some you
can.</TE>

<HD>Community Support Helps Drive Port Hueneme Crime Down by
13%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fernando Estrella has worked the streets of Port Hueneme for 32
years, but the small-town police chief says he has never felt such
support from his community.</LD>
<LD>   "We've always enjoyed a good working relationship," Estrella said,
"but after the events of 9/11 we've worked together even closer."</LD>
<LD>   The community's support for the 24-officer Police Department shows
up not only in public meetings, he said, but also when patrol
officers cruise the tree-lined neighborhoods of the seaside town.</LD>
<TE>   "You drive around and people want to talk with you now," said
Estrella, chief in the 22,000-resident city for two years. "We
interact more positively than we ever had before."</TE>
<TE>   That is how Estrella explains a 13% drop in crime in Port Hueneme
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mirror of the people who work here and the people who live
in this community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reported crime continued a decade of decline, during which
offenses have been cut in half, thanks to large reductions of theft,
auto theft and robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The city's crime rate now stands at 24 per 1,000 residents
compared with 49 in 1991, at its peak. As figured by the FBI, a
city's crime rate is the ratio of population to eight categories of
crime--murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, theft, auto
theft and arson.</TE>
<TE>   Port Hueneme's rate is in the middle of the pack among Ventura
County's 10 cities, which collectively rank among the safest areas in
the nation for jurisdictions of their size. Port Hueneme's decrease
in 2001 was second only to Fillmore's 18% decline.</TE>
<TE>   Credit is due in part to the city that surrounds Port Hueneme on
three sides, Estrella said. Oxnard's anti-gang unit helps Port
Hueneme keep the disgruntled youth of both cities under control.</TE>
<TE>   "We work very closely with Oxnard in identifying and keeping tabs
on the people [who] choose this particular lifestyle," the chief
said. "That's been a real plus."</TE>
<TE>   Burglars, however, worked Port Hueneme hard last year, as home and
business break-ins increased from 91 to 126.</TE>
<TE>   "In one area, a group of juveniles moved in and committed 10 to 15
burglaries before we took them into custody," Estrella said.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving juvenile hall recently, several of the burglars
moved out of the city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as crime has leveled off countywide in the last two years,
Port Hueneme's totals have continued to drop. Police counted 579
offenses in 1999 and 486 in 2001.</TE>

<DH>Development: Neighbors bid a fond farewell to Lake View
Terrace's last rancher and his eight longhorn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Appy Jack" Switzer can keep his 20-year bragging rights as the
cattle baron of Lake View Terrace for a few more weeks.</LD>
<LD>   A proposed housing development is forcing Switzer to close the
gates of his 31/2-acre ranch--the last in the community nestled in
the foothills of the northeast San Fernando Valley--and move his
eight longhorns.</LD>
<LD>   Several dozen friends and neighbors rallied Saturday to say
goodbye to Switzer and the herd, which some residents consider
neighborhood pets.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what I'm going to do when they leave," said Hattie
Star, who has lived next to Switzer's "Pet Ranch" for more than 20
years. "I look out my window and see a Texas longhorn standing on a
hill. How many people in Los Angeles can say that?"</TE>
<TE>   The tiny herd will be moved to a 4-H facility in nearby Shadow
Hills. Switzer, his family and neighbors are pleased the gentle
cattle--despite their fierce-looking horns--will be treated well.</TE>
<TE>   Switzer leased the land on Kagel Canyon Street at Brussels Avenue
from a doctor in 1980 for $75 a month "all on a handshake--no paper,"
Switzer said. When the doctor and his partners sold the land
recently, Switzer knew he would have to get rid of his herd.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a bittersweet parting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gotten to where I can't do it anymore," Switzer, 69, said of
the endless work required to care for the animals. Two strokes have
slowed him down considerably, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat tuckered out by Saturday's farewell rally, he eventually
greeted the steady parade of well-wishers and passersby from behind
the wheel of his blue 1963 Mercury Comet convertible, decked out with
fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview mirror and a serape covering the
dash. He had come to California in 1961 in a car much like it, said
his daughter, Terry Switzer.</TE>
<TE>   An Oklahoma native, Switzer has been a hobby rancher in the San
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys since he arrived and took a job on
the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at the plant until it closed in 1993, tending his
livestock before and after his 6 a.m.-3 p.m. shift.</TE>
<TE>   He appears every bit the suburban cowboy in his tan Stetson,
silver and turquoise rings and watchband, western shirt, corduroy
jacket, jeans and boots. Plexiglass shields mounted on the fronts of
his two pickups and his car all bear his moniker--Appy Jack.</TE>
<TE>   "People see his Appy Jack signs and think the 'H' fell off," his
daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not how it happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I rode my appaloosa through a horse show at Hansen Dam, and Homer
Harris from Tennessee yelled out, 'Here comes old Appy Jack,' and it
stuck," Switzer said.</TE>

<DH>Red Hats: Born on a lark, a growing women's group is
dedicated to having a good time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their aim was as obvious as the red hats planted squarely on their
heads: Let the good times roll.</LD>
<LD>   The women of the Red Hat Society streamed into Ventura on Saturday
by car and by train. They wore berets and bonnets, all of them red.
One woman wore a red baseball cap advertising Fresno Livestock, while
others labored under lace-laden scarlet chapeaus that looked as if
they could have cradled the heads that rolled in the French
Revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Groups strode into Main Street's antique shops and thrift stores.
They took over entire restaurants, whipping their feather boas
around, laughing and carrying on as if there were no tomorrow, which
was exactly the point.</LD>
<TE>   "Why not?" asked Sue Ellen Cooper, who founded the group in her
Fullerton home and is known as its Exalted Queen Mother. "Who cares?
We deserve to take the train somewhere and shop all day if we want
to. The sky won't fall."</TE>
<TE>   The group was accidentally started by Cooper a few years ago, when
she sent a friend a red hat and a poem titled "Warning" by Britain's
Jennifer Joseph. The red hat was just for fun. The poem, which Cooper
first noticed on a T-shirt, was more serious, a warning of impending
eccentricity by a middle-aged woman who wants to "make up for the
sobriety of my youth."</TE>
<TE>   "I shall wear purple," she vows, "with a red hat which doesn't go
and doesn't suit me.... "</TE>
<TE>   The narrator also plans to indulge in other mild outrages: to
"learn to spit," to "run my stick along the public railings," to
"gobble up samples in shops."</TE>
<TE>   With that as inspiration, Cooper and a few friends started getting
together for tea and chuckles, decked out in their red hats and
purple dresses. Visiting a laser tag arena en masse, they startled
local teenagers playing the high-tech version of paintball. Soon
women elsewhere heard about their good-time group and asked to start
their own chapters.</TE>
<TE>   Thus was born a pinkie-raised, tea-sipping, road-tripping,
belly-laughing, damn-the-torpedoes international women's movement, a
comfortable cross between Martha Stewart and Auntie Mame.</TE>
<TE>   With offices in Fullerton, the Red Hat Society estimates its 2,600
chapters have some 60,000 disciples. Most are 50 and over, with a
scattering of younger women required to wear hats that are pink. The
group's first convention will be held in Chicago next month, complete
with inspirational speakers and a pajamas-only breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura's train platform on Saturday, some 200 members trooped
off the Amtrak Surfliner to be jubilantly greeted in the parking lot
by another couple of hundred. Here, four or five women chimed in on
an off-key but enthusiastic rendition of "Jelly Roll Blues." There, a
few Red Hatters from Santa Barbara took swigs from water bottles,
puffed out their cheeks, and practiced that which they never learned
as young ladies: spitting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an acquired skill," explained Susie Stratton, a retiree who
was gingerly dabbing the excess water from her chin.</TE>
<TE>   Most Red Hatters aren't much on expectoration. Getting together
for tea or dinner, schmoozing and dressing in the group's trademark
colors are all they need.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Spranger, a nurse in Modesto, said her 82-year-old mother
has worn the Red Hat garb not only to club functions but also to
church.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like watching a bird in the front yard puff up," Spranger
said. "It just changed her whole outlook--like, 'Yessss! I'm
somebody!'"</TE>
<TE>   Finally Making 'Time for Me'</TE>
<TE>   Spranger's group goes in for the occasional cocktail and is
thinking of renting a limo for an evening at the opera in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked since I was 15," she said. "I was a single parent and
raised three teenagers. Now it's time for me."</TE>
<TE>   That's just the point, says Exalted Queen Mother Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is that internal person saying you're too old or shouldn't
want to have fun?" she asks. "That inner voice is lying to you."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Cooper rallied the Red Hat troops in a building at
the Ventura County Fairgrounds. Throngs stood three-deep at tables
stacked with framed copies of what group members call The Poem, Red
Hat pins, Red Hat T-shirts, and, of course, red hats.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper also peddles such items on the group's Web site but says
she's not Exalted Queen Mother just for the money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about sisterhood," she said. "When you get a bunch of
women together in these colors, you can't ignore us--no matter how
hard you try.'</TE>
<TE>   Men are not formally barred as companions at Red Hat functions,
but only a handful, including Cooper's husband, Allen, showed up
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are wistful," Cooper said, "but a lot of them just
don't get it."</TE>

<HD>College Board Weighs Revising SAT to Keep UC</HD>
<DH>Test: Changes are considered in response to a proposal that
the state come up with its own admissions exam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scrambling to hang onto the lucrative business of the University of
California, the College Board is considering major changes in the SAT
test, including adding a writing sample, College Board officials said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed revisions, which also include cutting or dropping the
verbal analogies section and toughening the math questions, would
amount to the most significant overhaul in years in the SAT, a test
endured by generations of college-bound students.</LD>
<LD>   "Just adding the writing [section] would be a huge change," said
Gaston Caperton, president of the nonprofit College Board, which owns
the SAT.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel it's a good thing to do, and it would mean a
substantially improved program," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caperton said he will meet with university presidents and advisory
groups around the country during the next three months to discuss the
proposed revisions. The trustees are to vote on a final version of
the plan in June, he said, with any changes taking effect for the
high school class that graduates in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The College Board's plan marks the latest turn in a process
launched last year, when UC President Richard C. Atkinson proposed in
a speech in Washington that his university drop the SAT in favor of a
test more closely linked to high school course work.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson, a cognitive psychologist and testing expert, said the
exam was unfair to many students and tested ill-defined notions of
aptitude, instead of measuring how much they learned in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Caperton acknowledged Saturday that the criticism by the UC--a
nine-campus system that is the SAT's biggest client--had persuaded
the College Board to take action now, although he said the trustees
had been considering changes for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the UC said what they said about the test, we've talked to
lots of people, and it became real clear to me that we needed to come
to some conclusions" quickly, Caperton said.</TE>
<TE>   UC spokesman Michael Reese called the College Board decision a
positive step, but said it was too soon to tell whether the proposals
would meet the criteria for a new admissions test recently spelled
out by a UC faculty committee.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Reese said, "We're pleased with the direction the
College Board seems to be going."</TE>
<TE>   Sparked by Atkinson's proposal to drop the SAT, the faculty
committee has spent a year drafting guidelines for a new admissions
test that would be tailored specifically to the university and would
measure a student's mastery of high school course work.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has called for a core achievement test--of 31/2 to
four hours--that would cover reading, writing and math skills.
Students would also be required to take two one-hour tests, similar
to the SAT II exams, in specific subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Both the College Board and ACT Inc., makers of the SAT's chief
rival, the ACT exam, have said they would be willing to work with the
UC to develop a new test.</TE>
<TE>   UC regents are expected to vote on the proposal in July, but at a
discussion this month, several regents questioned whether it was
worth the expense and time to the university to come up with a new
test.</TE>
<TE>   Others asked whether an exam tailor-made to UC standards would be
accepted by other leading universities, or if California students who
want to apply to several schools might soon have to take even more
admissions exams than they do now. The discussion is expected to
continue at the regents' meeting at UCLA in May.</TE>
<TE>   Caperton expressed the hope Saturday that a significantly revised
SAT might eliminate the need for a custom California exam. But in the
meantime, he said, the College Board would pursue both avenues,
continuing to work with the UC on a California test and pushing
forward at the same time for a new national exam.</TE>
<TE>   The College Board president said it was too early to outline how
each section of the SAT might change, but said a revised test was
very likely to cut or eliminate the analogies portion--a pet peeve of
UC President Atkinson's. In its place, the new SAT would have a
section on reading comprehension, Caperton said.</TE>
<TE>   The UC criticism, and that of other universities in recent years,
has had a positive effect, he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man has filed suit against a church pastor for allegedly having an
affair with his wife while the pastor was providing marriage
counseling for the couple.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed this week accuses former Senior Pastor Joe Haydock
of giving negligent, false and improper marital advice to obtain
sexual favors and ruin the marriage. The suit also names Clovis
Evangelical Free Church, which hired Haydock and offered the free
counseling sessions.</LD>
<LD>   John D. Barker, 45, alleges his wife, Amber, and Haydock began a
sexual affair while Haydock was counseling the couple from 1999 to
2001. The Barkers have since filed for divorce.</LD>

been an arson attempt at one of San Francisco's oldest synagogues.</LD>
<LD>   Fire Department spokesman Pete Howes said crews arrived at
Congregation Beth Israel-Judea along the city's Brotherhood Way
around 7:30 p.m. Friday after synagogue members said they smelled
gasoline and a janitor found several cans of gasoline on the roof.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters found empty containers of gasoline and propane on the
synagogue's roof, as well as what Howe called "wick material." No one
was injured, and no part of the structure caught fire, he said.</LD>

<DH>Crime: A mentally disabled man dies when someone throws a
firebomb into his Oxnard home and then fires several shots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY and STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mentally disabled Oxnard man was shot dead and his home firebombed
early Saturday in an attack that stunned police and neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Isaac Hughes, 61, was sleeping in his bed about 4:30 a.m. when
someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the kitchen window and fired
multiple shots into another window. As relatives struggled to douse
the fire in the kitchen, Hughes lay dying in his room from a shoulder
wound.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard police don't know why Hughes, who had the IQ of a
7-year-old, was targeted.</LD>
<TE>   The victim lived in the 1800 block of Ferrara Way near the city's
Colonia neighborhood. He shared the house with six adult relatives,
and none was known to have any criminal involvement, said Sgt. Jim
Seitz of the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look at any and all the theories we can," he said.
"Why they picked his room we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Seitz said the bullet may have traveled through Hughes' shoulder
into his chest, killing him. An autopsy will be performed today.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described Hughes as a gentle, loving man who played
guitar and listened to Christian music. He had lived in the home for
more than 30 years and was a fixture in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very spiritual man; we always called him Brother Isaac,"
said Pat Rios, 66, who lives down the street from Hughes and has
known the family for years. "They were a good, close-knit family.
Isaac would sit outside the house and play his Christian music loud.
I can't see who would want to hurt him."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gaston attended Tried Stone Church of God in Christ with
Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a Christian and he minded his own business," said Gaston,
37. "It's a senseless, senseless tragedy and one that is hard to
understand."</TE>
<TE>   A woman who said she was a relative of Hughes' came out of the
single-story blue home he lived in to discuss the attack. Other
family members declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "There were eight bullet holes in the window, we have bullet holes
in three parts of our house," said the woman, who didn't give her
name. "I helped put out the fire but we didn't know what was going
on."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't believe race played a role in the attack. Hughes was
African American, and the neighborhood is predominantly Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the neighborhood has been the scene of past gang
violence, some of it spilling over from the Colonia district.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor said Hughes had witnessed a car theft and may have
been killed to keep him from talking. Police could not be reached to
verify that. Others on the street refused to discuss the incident.
Despite the intense police activity Saturday morning, one next-door
neighbor said he hadn't seen or heard anything.</TE>
<TE>   Eddy Rios Jr. was baffled by the attack on Hughes, a man he has
known since 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no enemies," he said, shaking his head in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators asked that anyone with information call 385-7763 or
at 385-7760.</TE>

<HD>State Reports Slight Rise in TB Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The number of tuberculosis cases reported in California rose slightly
in 2001, but the TB rate--the number of cases per 100,000
residents--remained the same, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   There were 3,332 new cases reported last year, up from 3,297 in
2000. That means there were 9.5 cases for every 100,000 residents
both years.</LD>
<LD>   The number of TB cases has declined since 5,382 were reported in
1992.</LD>
<TE>   "TB is an age-old disease, and eliminating it is a fight that
public health workers are waging around the world," said Diana Bonta,
the state's health director. "Although we have made great progress in
California and in the United States, we know that much remains to be
done to prevent a resurgence of the disease."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stagnant rate of new TB cases, California still has
the highest number of cases in the nation, and there are wide
differences in the TB rate among the state's ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The rate for Asians and Pacific islanders is 33.8 per 100,000
residents; for blacks, it's 12.4 per 100,000; and for Hispanics, it's
11.4 per 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Native Americans have a rate of 7.7 per 100,000, and the rate for
white, non-Hispanic residents is 2.1 per 100,000.</TE>

<HD>Storied History of Central Library Speaks Volumes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The saga of the Los Angeles Central Library is as dramatic as any
that can be found in the books on its shelves. Designed by a man who
died before it could be finished, the unique and beloved building was
nearly torn down by city fathers and nearly undone by two arson
fires, only to rise from its own ashes.</LD>
<LD>   The library originated in 1844 in a town of fewer than 1,500
people, with a collection of donated books and some cherished
newspapers that were only 6 months old. For decades, the city's
collection remained a movable feast, shifting from donated quarters
above a saloon, to a floor of old City Hall, to a department store.
The collection would overflow one location and simply move to
another.</LD>
<LD>   From 1880 to 1905, a series of remarkable, assertive and
independent-minded women served as city librarians and boosted its
reputation. At a time when government careers were largely off limits
to women, librarianship was a unique haven to display executive
abilities.</LD>
<TE>   The path was cleared for the library's first true innovator, Mary
Emily Foy, when her two predecessors became a distraction: One was
dismissed for smoking foul-smelling jimson weed to ward off asthma
attacks; the next took more of an interest in whiskey than in books.</TE>
<TE>   Foy was a feisty, outspoken feminist. She set up a Dewey Decimal
card-catalog system, hosted the Ladies Reading Room, served as
referee for ongoing chess games, and settled bets made by downstairs
saloon patrons on such questions as "Who wrote Webster's dictionary:
Noah or Daniel?" (It was Noah.)</TE>
<TE>   Another of the library's early leaders was the redoubtable Tessa
Kelso, who in the 1890s smoked cigarettes in public, wore her hair
short, and beat back a clergyman's efforts to get a racy French novel
removed from the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   In her six years as librarian, from 1889 to 1895, Kelso increased
the collection sevenfold. Readership rose too; there were 132 library
cards issued when she took over and 20,000 when she left. But her
most significant contribution was abolishing the fees, making
book-borrowing free.</TE>
<TE>   Another librarian who figured in the Central Library's history was
Mary Jones, who was ousted from her position in 1905--to make way for
a man. She sued. The city attorney upheld the appointment of Charles
Fletcher Lummis, calling him the "best-known bookman in California."
He was also Theodore Roosevelt's former classmate at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Lummis was an irrepressible character, a booster of Southwest
culture, a writer, a magazine publisher, an author and one of the
founders of the Southwest Museum.</TE>
<TE>   He was so incensed by what he considered overwrought historical
romances that he inserted a "poison" label in such books to advise
readers that this was thin and dubious stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Annoyed by the steady outflow of books stolen and missing, Lummis
made up a branding iron that read "LA PUB LIBRARY," with which he
marked the top leaves of the city's volumes. To this day, his brands
remain in the library's historical works.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired in 1910 for spending too much money; he had locked
the library into an expensive lease and gave himself a raise and a
pension. But whatever his quirks--including a diary in which he
boasted of how many times and how well he performed in the bedroom,
with his wife and others--Lummis was a crucial builder of the Los
Angeles Public Library. His acquisitions brought acclaim to the
library's special collections on the history of California and the
West.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until 1921, with the passage of a special bond issue,
that the path was cleared for the library's permanent home. Campaign
slogans included "Grow up, Los Angeles! Own your own public library
and take your place with progressive cities!" Voters also were
reminded that the annual average cost of the bond issue to property
owners was 50 cents--"less than the price of one movie."</TE>
<TE>   For the irresistible price of $1, the city acquired land downtown
on Normal Hill for the new library--the former site of the State
Normal School, the forerunner of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The architect was Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, designer of the
Nebraska State Capitol. His first California building went up in
1902, and he so adored the state that he once wrote that his heart
"yearns so for California and everything this magic name connotes."
His enormous influence here extended from his designs for the 1915
Panama-California International Exhibition in San Diego to his work
at the Throop Polytechnic Institute in Pasadena, now Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   But the design for the Central Library was less California Spanish
or Mission than a unique blend of styles--Spanish, Roman,
Egyptian--that made it truly exceptional. The architect died in 1924,
two years before the library opened.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, its proportioned spaces, its textures and light, and
its appointments and artwork charm patrons and visitors. The
children's reading room became known as the Ivanhoe Room for the
frieze murals of knights and ladies. The children's library is
ornamented with Albert Herter's murals of the city's history. A dozen
murals by Dean Cornwell, 9,000 square feet in all, chronicle the
history of California.</TE>
<TE>   The striking north staircase is guarded by two sphinxes of black
Belgian marble. Representing the mysteries of knowledge, they crouch
at the feet of the Statue of Civilization.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, the illuminated chandelier globe adorned by
zodiac symbols was lowered to the ground to protect it from damage in
case of bombing. Wartime blackouts also extinguished its light.</TE>
<TE>   Goodhue had redrafted his original rounded dome into a more
timeless pyramidal tower--less expensive, and with more room for
books--and topped it with "the light of learning" torch. Ornamenting
the south exterior are six carved historical figures, from Socrates
and Justinian to Da Vinci, representing six disciplines of knowledge.
Above one entrance is the inscription: "In the world of affairs we
live in our own age; in books we live in all ages."</TE>
<TE>   Soon the acclaimed structure would become a victim of its own
success. What Goodhue envisioned in the 1920s as a home for 1 million
books was, within a decade, lending that many in a single month. By
the 1950s, the facility was antiquated and impossibly overcrowded. A
1685 Shakespeare Fourth Folio was wrapped in blankets and stored in a
utility closet. Plugging in a coffeepot could blow a circuit. The
fabulous murals were coated with decades of grime.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, studies and votes on the library came and
went: to tear it down, to restore it, to sell it. Finally, a viable
proposal: Sell the library's air rights to build adjacent skyscrapers
and use the money to restore and expand the library with a grand new
wing.</TE>
<TE>   Then came April 29, 1986. An arson fire destroyed nearly 400,000
books and documents--the equivalent of four smaller libraries. A
smaller arson fire followed that September. The cases were never
solved.</TE>
<TE>   But the fires that horrified Los Angeles galvanized both its
leaders and its residents. The battle to save the books from fire and
water damage united the city. More than 1,700 volunteers labored to
salvage the surviving books, and civic leaders and the public raised
millions to restore the old building.</TE>
<TE>   With the sale of the air rights completed, the $214-million
library renovation began in 1987. It took six years.</TE>
<TE>   With an exterior of green terra cotta, the dramatic new wing--an
eight-story atrium built partly below ground--is as deep as the
Goodhue library is broad. It is open and bright, lined with several
floors of reading rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Even its elevators are wallpapered whimsically in cards from the
obsolete card-catalog files. Escalators move below enormous
fiberglass-and-aluminum free-form chandeliers. Designers meticulously
reproduced vintage light fixtures, the old acorn chair motifs, and
even derived carpet patterns from the building's original stencil and
tile work.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the grounds have been redesigned as the Robert F. Maguire
III Gardens, set about with trees and pools and benches. Cut into the
facings of the long ascent of steps to the west entrance are
inscriptions in many typefaces and languages--including computer
icons and mathematical formulas. A bronze map of the world pinpoints
the sites of history's book-burnings and its great library fires.</TE>
<TE>   An excerpt from the novel "Brave New World," in Aldous Huxley's
own scribbled handwriting, is one of the inscriptions on the steps.
Huxley was a Los Angeles transplant, reared on the libraries of
England. He once wrote Los Angeles' librarian to compliment her on
fine service and "a sound selection of books."</TE>
<TE>   Another celebrated patron, author Ray Bradbury, often speaks of
educating himself by the Central Library's shelves.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Mayor Richard Riordan's Library Commission voted to
rename the library in the mayor's honor. Some folks didn't like the
break with tradition; the building had been named for Rufus von
KleinSmid, a former USC chancellor and city library commissioner. But
others said the mayor had done much to promote reading and library
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a bronze plaque trumpets the new name of the city's
flagship library: "Richard J. Riordan Central Library."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Earning nearly $300 million at the box office thus far and nominated
for Oscar gold, "The Lord of the Rings" seems charmed from the start.
When you add that the books were voted the best of the 20th century
in several recent polls and have sold 50 million copies worldwide,
you know there is something more profound at work here.</LD>
<LD>   According to the writer Sean McGrath, "Rings" holds a magic mirror
to our world and "penetrates below the skin to expose the archetypes
within ... laying bare the nature and scale of the universal quest in
which we are every one of us engaged: what we stand to lose and what
we stand to gain."</LD>
<LD>   Far more than a fairy tale, J.R.R. Tolkien's epic parallel world
of good and evil is one in which we can participate vicariously.
Through rich and evocative language (the kind you would expect from a
world-renowned Oxford philologist) and daring heroics, the author
explores the themes of choice, free will and sacrifice, while
exposing the many faces of power. And by using the most unlikely
hero, an innocent and untried 3-foot-tall Hobbit who has hardly
stepped out of the confines of his home--and setting him up against
the most unimaginable evil--he awakens the believer in us all.</LD>
<TE>   In Tolkien's World, Everything Matters</TE>
<TE>   That's part of Tolkien's magic. He understands the underdog,
injustice and the impossible dream, and in response has created a
David-vs.-Goliath world in which everything matters--where choices,
virtue and heroics, however large or small, are incredibly
significant. In Middle-earth the stakes are high but also clear,
which is a far cry from our own time, when morality often is drowned
in the murky waters of public opinion, and good gives way too easily
to mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   Like his friend and fellow writer C.S. Lewis, Tolkien found truth
(as with his Christian faith) to be eternal, unchanging and
nonnegotiable. Joseph Pearce, author of "Tolkien, Man and Myth," told
me in a recent radio interview: "Tolkien believed that good and evil
are objectively real ... that they exist. This in and of itself in
our relativistic age is provocative. It's not a question of your evil
being my good, and your good being my evil."</TE>
<TE>   Satan was quite real to Tolkien, as was a God from whom the truth
emanated. He believed in his dualistic fictional world, as in our
real one, that there was a divine plan, and that there was "a final
bliss to be enjoyed."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Pearce attributes "Rings" phenomenal success and enduring
appeal in part to this point. He said, "He's tapping into the needs
of so many readers. They've been told by certain sectors of the
intelligentsia that there is no good and evil, but they know better."</TE>
<TE>   Salvation Theme Is Central to 'Rings'</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, salvation is central to the metaphorical
masterpiece. We see the four main heroes make unbelievable sacrifices
as each undergoes a Christlike kind of death, rebirth and descent
into the underworld in the quest for the ultimate redemption. In the
face of such awesome feats, readers and moviegoers are humbled,
inspired and even transformed.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this is why we love "Rings" so much. It awakens something
deep, virtuous and transcendent within. Pearce said, "You will lose
yourself in [Tolkien's] wonderful world ... wonderful in the literal
sense ... as in wonder-filled. But at the same time you lose yourself
in that world, paradoxically you find yourself in this one."</TE>

<HD>'Well-Rounded' in 2002</HD>
<DH>Global Education, Especially after 9/11, Has Become
Essential</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN TYE</AU>
<BD>Ken Tye is emeritus professor of education at Chapman
University in Orange and was co-director of the Center for Human
Interdependence global education project. www.globaleducationFYI@
earthlink.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For five years in the late 1980s, 11 Orange County elementary and
secondary schools participated in an effort to integrate knowledge of
world affairs into the curriculum. Coordinated by a privately funded
grant based at Chapman University, the project was designed to
support and enhance basic skills and curricular subjects by linking
them, when appropriate, to current events and issues. The teachers
themselves decided whether they wanted to participate and what they
wanted to work on.</LD>
<LD>   Loosely defined as the study of problems and issues that cut
across national boundaries, the global education movement in the
United States dates from the 1970s, when a number of major
foundations and the National Endowment for the Humanities began to
fund the development of programs and instructional materials. By the
mid-'80's, global education projects were underway in 27 states. In
1987, the National Governors Assn. released "Educating Americans for
Tomorrow's World," a report endorsing the movement.</LD>
<TE>   By the late '80s, the legislature had allocated state funding for
the California International Studies Program, a network of centers to
train teachers interested in working some global units into their
teaching. During the '90s, it became more difficult to find funding
for global education, but the need for it grew more and more obvious.
Since Sept. 11, it has become starkly evident that Americans need to
know much more about the world than they do: A renewal of commitment
to global education is in order.</TE>
<TE>   California's curriculum standards are highly compatible with such
an effort, at every grade level and in every subject area. The high
school science standards require that students "investigate a
science-based societal issue by researching the literature, analyzing
data, and communicating the findings. Examples of issues include
irradiation of food, cloning of animals--choice of energy sources,
and land and water use decisions." Such topics have local, national
and global implications, and all three should be examined.</TE>
<TE>   The third-grade Language Arts standards include the following:
"Comprehend the basic plots of classic fairy tales, myths, folk
tales, legends, and fables from around the world." In middle-school
social studies, the state standards require that students be able to
"detect the different historical points of view on historical events
and determine the context in which the historical statements were
made (the questions asked, sources used, author's perspectives)."
There is an opportunity here for teachers to use primary sources to
show that an event may be seen differently by different people, for a
variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Once you start thinking about ways to link the traditional
curriculum to the study of topics that connect the United States to
the world, the ideas just keep on coming.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapman project was designed to provide one model of how
global education might be done: Other projects all over the nation
chose other ways. One of the strengths of this curriculum movement
has been its flexibility, with a grass-roots effort in each
community. No single definition has ever emerged, nor should it.</TE>
<TE>   Most educators who have become involved are committed to the
general goals of broadening students' horizons, including helping
them to see world issues from a variety of perspectives; building
critical thinking skills; and better preparing our young people for
productive lives in a nation that belongs to an increasingly
interdependent world community. Exactly how these goals are addressed
in any school or district, however, is a matter for local choice.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapman project ended officially in 1989, but global education
in the project schools did not end. In 1996 we returned for a
follow-up study and were pleased to find that not only were most of
the original project teachers still including global topics and
skills in their curriculum, but also that many teachers who had
originally chosen not to participate had subsequently begun, on their
own or with other teachers, to add some "globalized" units. More than
one told us that international events since the project ended--such
as the dissolution of the Soviet empire and the increasingly ob-
vious connectedness of the glo- bal marketplace--had convinced them
that global awareness was fast becoming a basic skill that their
students would need just as much as they needed reading, writing,
math and science.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly anyone today would argue that we are not living in a global
age. Since World War II, there has been an inexorable movement toward
regional and international cooperation and the integration of
international economic, political, environmental, technological and
cultural systems. That is the world our children and grandchildren
will live in, and it is the world for which we must prepare them.
Schools in other countries are moving in this direction, and if we
fail to do so, we'll be putting our youngsters at a disadvantage.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Mayor Earns Respect in Spite of Himself</HD>
<DH>Politics: The former gangland lawyer is getting things done in the
desert oasis, and he's doing it his way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGIE WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>The mayor of Las Vegas, nearing the end of a typical 15-hour day,
is sipping a martini with his wife, talking about the horse he bet on and
the tractor-trailer he drove down the Strip.</LD>
<LD>   Usually, Oscar Goodman doesn't call it a day until he's clashed with
someone, but sometimes even the self-described world's happiest mayor
gets lucky in Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   "It's wonderful," he says of being the mayor of the nation's
fastest-growing city. "You get up in the morning, you're out and about,
you're making the city a better place. It's the perfect life."</LD>
<TE>   He is a mix of the old and the new Las Vegas, a reminder of the city's
shady past and the biggest cheerleader for its future.</TE>
<TE>   He gambles. He drinks. He says the wrong things. Yet he's popular.
Really popular.</TE>
<TE>   "I represent the city of Las Vegas the way it should be," Goodman
says. "It's not a mundane, run-of-the-mill place. I feel I am the
people's mayor."</TE>
<TE>   It's been almost three years since Goodman came out of nowhere to run
a populist campaign that culminated in a landslide victory over a veteran
city councilman. It was his first try at public office. Before 1999, he
was a high-profile criminal defense attorney whose mob clients included
Meyer Lansky and Anthony "Tony the Ant" Spilotro, who once reputedly
placed a rival's head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman grew bored with his other cases after Spilotro was killed in
1986. He was looking for a change. When he suggested running for mayor,
even his four kids were surprised. They told their father he had more
baggage than airport skycaps.</TE>
<TE>   Valet car attendants and taxi drivers know his name. So do casino pit
bosses and gamblers. "He's not afraid to speak his mind," says limousine
driver Ken Herrera, who greets Goodman outside a casino. "It's what we
need."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, a casino valet shakes the mayor's hand, lifts his shirt
to show his bullet wounds and talks about an uncle "on vacation" in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "Prison?" the mayor asks.</TE>
<TE>   The worker nods. "I know some of the people you know," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman, 62, arrives at Bally's hotel-casino on the Strip to welcome
the United Auto Workers. The Strip is actually outside the city, but
Goodman is a popular choice for convention speeches and promotions.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I speaking about?" he asks his spokesman, Erik Pappa.</TE>
<TE>   Good question, since Goodman, 62, doesn't write speeches, except for
the annual state-of-the-city address. Sometimes his off-the-cuff approach
results in bold remarks that make local headlines. Other times, he tells
funny stories and, as with the UAW, gives a welcome to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Speech done, he's leaving the casino when he remembers he wants to bet
on a horse.</TE>
<TE>   He plops down $100 on Beefeater Baby, the favorite to win at Santa
Anita this day. Beefeater is a favorite brand of gin, and the mayor likes
his martinis--straight up, ice on the side. ("I drink more gin than any
human being," he says.)</TE>
<TE>   The Beefeater company even asked the mayor to be a spokesman for the
gin, but Goodman says he and the company couldn't agree on a price, and
he's now considering touting another brand. Any money he receives will go
into the city's general fund, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Once the mouthpiece of the mob, it's often his mouth that gets him
into trouble. He says what he wants, no matter the audience.</TE>
<TE>   He called U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham "that piece of
garbage" for recommending nearby Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste dump.</TE>
<TE>   When someone spilled a white powdery substance next to his Mercedes in
the city hall parking garage, Goodman offered to go after the person with
a baseball bat.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless advocates accused him of being insensitive after he suggested
rounding them up and busing them to an abandoned prison 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fine line in politics in being a maverick and being a
buffoon," says Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston. "I think he's right
on that line or is about to cross over it.</TE>
<TE>   "He listens to nobody. He has a titanic ego."</TE>
<TE>   But Goodman insists he says what people are scared to say.</TE>
<TE>   Polls consistently show an approval rating of 75% to 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when there have been things his critics have tried to take
advantage of, it doesn't really affect his numbers that much," says
Marvin Longabaugh, president of Magellan Research, a Las Vegas public
opinion polling company.</TE>
<TE>   "His charisma trumps just about anything else he does."</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, the mayor has the same power as a council member and is
the ceremonial head of government, making $52,633 a year.</TE>
<TE>   But try telling Goodman he is a glorified councilman.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest achievement came in 2000 when the city acquired a 61-acre
parcel of downtown land. His dream is to establish an academic medical
center there in a downtown he envisions as a trendy attraction of bars,
restaurants, shops and a museum.</TE>
<TE>   For that to happen, Goodman needs Neonopolis, a downtown entertainment
mall of movie theaters, restaurants and a bowling alley, to succeed. The
project was already in the works before Goodman took office, but when it
opens in May, its popularity will determine if it can anchor
redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   By fall, a downtown pedestrian plaza will have a waterfall and
reflecting pond that Goodman has nicknamed "Oscar's River." Construction
is expected to begin soon on a proposed downtown arena that will host a
minor-league hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has tried to lure a major-league sports team to the city,
but says Las Vegas lost out because the gambling industry didn't support
the idea. "They don't want to let their customers out of their
smoke-filled casinos," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman is critical of the casinos because they haven't supported his
pet projects, says Bill Bible, president of the Nevada Resort Assn.,
which represents many hotel-casinos.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm of the belief that most people in the industry don't really take
him seriously," he says. "Sometimes the most popular people don't
accomplish anything."</TE>
<TE>   There was talk of a run for governor, but Goodman, a Democrat, doesn't
want to give up being mayor. He intends to seek another term next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether I'm a visionary, but I am a person with dreams,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   And clearly a man enamored of the city that has brought him fame for a
second time.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the Strip, the mayor is invited to drive a tractor-trailer
hauling food donated by the Farm Bureau to the Ronald McDonald house for
sick children's families.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers cheer as he tells a story about an adopted pig. Then he
heads to the tractor-trailer and quips: "All I'm doing is praying to God
that the big-roller doesn't hit the high-roller."</TE>
<TE>   Then it's off to another casino for a radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   By 9 p.m. and after two more speeches, the mayor is dining with
Carolyn, his wife of almost 40 years, at an Italian restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   It's been 15 hours, five public appearances and four interviews since
he left his home, and there's not a hint that he's tired. He doesn't even
call this a busy day.</TE>
<TE>   The horse he bet on won. Goodman's take was $120. Carolyn rolls her
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   On their drive home, she remarks about an obnoxious store sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to do something about that," the mayor says with a
believable grin.</TE>

<HD>Utah, N. Carolina at Odds Over Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: Census estimation procedure allowed North Carolina to
slip ahead in population and claim the congressional slot. Utah wants a
recount.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL FOY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday over an
obscure census practice that helped give North Carolina an extra
congressional seat and left Utah howling in protest, claiming the seat as
its own.</LD>
<LD>   The high court agreed to resolve the tug-of-war before the fall
elections. An optimistic Utah has drawn an optional fourth congressional
district in case it prevails.</LD>
<LD>   Campaigns already are under way in North Carolina for its new 13th
U.S. House seat.</LD>
<TE>   "North Carolina believes it won this seat fair and square. It's just
too late for Utah to be challenging the results of the census," North
Carolina Atty. Gen. Roy Cooper said. "It would cause serious problems to
undo" the results of the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt is unapologetic. "It's simply an issue of
fairness," he said. "We want the seat."</TE>
<TE>   The case boils down to one word--"actual"--in the requirement by the
U.S. Constitution for an "actual enumeration" of state populations every
10 years. States can gain or lose congressional seats based on shifting
populations.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, the Census Bureau uses a bit of guesswork for a tiny
sliver of the U.S. population, after exhausting efforts to verify whether
households exist at addresses listed in its master file. But if it is
unable to actually count people after six visits, the bureau simply
assigns the same number of occupants to the presumed household as that of
its nearest neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   That trick added less than half a percent to the total U.S. population
in the 2000 census. But it was enough for North Carolina to edge Utah,
another fast-growing state, in the reallocation of the final
congressional seat.</TE>
<TE>   Utah argues the "phantom" households could just as well be businesses,
storage units or typographical errors. North Carolina gained four times
as many households as Utah under this practice, called hot-deck
imputation.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were six follow-up visits and you still don't know whether
it's occupied, the best conclusion is it's not occupied," argues Tom Lee,
a Brigham Young University law professor who will argue Utah's case
before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The Census Bureau says studies have confirmed 75% of "imputed"
households are occupied homes.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not phantom households," said Walter Dellinger, the U.S.
solicitor general under the Clinton administration, who will argue North
Carolina's case Wednesday. "This is a method the Census Bureau used with
the full knowledge of Congress for the past 40 years to resolve
inconsistencies and incomplete data at the end of the process."</TE>
<TE>   But Lee said it wasn't until the 2000 census that the bureau began
assuming some entries on its master file were apartments or houses
without solid evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be making six visits but not finding an address, or they are
unable to determine if it's a house or business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Utah is asking the Supreme Court to order Commerce Secretary Don Evans
to issue new congressional apportionment figures without the imputed
estimates. That would leapfrog Utah over North Carolina for the final
House seat. No other state would be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, defending the Census Bureau,
insists that imputation is not the same as statistical sampling struck
down by the Supreme Court in 1999. The bureau had planned to count up to
10% of the U.S. population by using a sample of the whole population.</TE>
<TE>   Utah contends imputation is sampling by another name. It says the
census is supposed to be as close to an actual head count as possible,
not a guessing game.</TE>
<TE>   A special three-judge federal panel in Salt Lake City didn't see it
that way. It rejected Utah's "effort to ascribe some exalted meaning to
'actual enumeration,' " leading to the Supreme Court appeal.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Threat in Red Zone</HD>
<DH>Resources: Several straight years of drought have depleted
reservoirs and left acreage dangerously parched, experts warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT WELLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Several dry winters have drawn down reservoirs throughout much of
the West, parched the land and left it vulnerable to wildfires.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists fear much of the region could be plagued by wind-driven
fires. Federal fire officials rate the fire danger as above average in
several states.</LD>
<LD>   "We could see the kind of wind-driven fires that have everybody
running in May and June and burn 10,000 acres in two days, versus the
200-acre fire that scares people but doesn't spread very fast in August,"
Colorado climatologist Nolan Doesken said.</LD>
<TE>   Sporadic fires have kept firefighters busy in at least three states
including Arizona, where a recent wildfire burned nearly 2,000 acres in
the Huachuca Mountains before it was contained.</TE>
<TE>   A 600-acre fire near Lamar in southeastern Colorado recently destroyed
several buildings before it was contained. Officials there have banned
open fires. In Ojo Feliz, N.M., residents were evacuated for several
hours earlier this month after a 15-acre wildfire destroyed a garage.</TE>
<TE>   "I have just come back from a meeting on the upcoming wildfire season.
The worst state is Arizona. It is ready to go as soon as there is any
source of ignition, a campfire or passing train," said Klaus Wolter, a
scientist at the federal Climate Diagnostics Center in Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters are monitoring the situation on a daily basis, said Rose
Davis, a spokeswoman for the Boise, Idaho-based National Interagency Fire
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "There's concern that continues to grow as time goes by and we don't
have the precipitation," she said. "The southwestern part of the United
States is on higher alert and has activated more resources early. They're
very concerned about their dry conditions."</TE>
<TE>   In some states, it is the fourth consecutive year of drought. Since
October, precipitation has been below normal in much of the West except
for Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   The national fire center says a broad swath through central and
eastern Montana; all of Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah; the southern
and western quadrant of Nevada; Southern California; and all of Arizona
and New Mexico face above-average fire danger.</TE>
<TE>   The Kaibab National Forest, near Flagstaff, is already looking at
seven-day coverage for emergency firefighter coverage.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a substantial increase in funding for hiring
firefighters and buying firetrucks. More money will be available for
helicopters and air tankers, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say there is one sign of hope for some states. Last month,
they detected a 4-degree increase in water temperature off the coast of
South America, which could mean El Nino's return. That likely would mean
more precipitation in some areas--but less in others.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't exclude that this El Nino might get strong enough in the
next four to six weeks that it may have some impact. There is better than
a 50-50 chance. If this comes to pass, it will be big news," Wolter said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government manages about 710 million acres of land, most
of it in the West. According to a 2001 update of the federal wildfire
plan, human activities on 211 million acres of federal land have
increased "the probability of large, intense fires beyond any scale yet
witnessed."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state-by-state rundown of drought status in the West:</LD>
<LD>   Arizona: Snowfall is considerably below normal and wildfire indexes
are at May levels in March. A good prospect for El Nino precipitation if
the phenomenon develops.</LD>
<LD>   California: Recent snowfalls have boosted snowpack levels.
Above-average wildfire danger in the southern half of the state. Average
in the north. Likely to receive considerable precipitation if El Nino
appears.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado: Snowpacks are 60% of average in a state that supplies water
to much of the Southwest. Wildfire danger is rated above average. El Nino
could make a big difference.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho: Snowpack is better than last year but the state remains below
average. Last year also was relatively dry. Fire danger is rated as
average except the southeastern corner, where it is above average.</TE>
<TE>   Montana: The snowpack was above average in some areas west of the
Continental Divide, but below average in the east. Soil is suffering from
four years of dry weather, and El Nino usually means dryer weather. Fire
danger is rated average in the west, above average in the east.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada: Recent heavy snowfalls have brought snowpack above average in
some areas. Fire danger is rated average except in the southeastern
quadrant, where it is rated above average.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico: Fire danger is rated above average, although El Nino would
deliver significant precipitation. The snowpack level in eight of 12
river basins is less than 50% of average.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon: Recent wet weather has eased concerns. Fire danger is rated
average in most of the state and below average in the northwest. El Nino
is not a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Utah: Got good snow for the Olympics but is in its fourth year of
drought. Wildfire danger is rated above average. A good El Nino prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Washington: Recent rains have reduced the fire danger to average in
most of the state and below average in the northwest. El Nino is not a
factor.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming: Snowpack levels are better than last year but still up to 25%
below normal. Wildfire danger is rated above average.</TE>

<HD>Officials Ask to Arm Guardsmen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER THORNE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A group of 58 U.S. senators is asking the Bush administration to
approve arming National Guard troops assigned to security detail along
the nation's borders.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,700 National Guardsmen have been called up to staff
crossings in states along the Canadian and Mexican borders. While their
counterparts who were called up to help protect the nation's airports are
allowed to carry firearms, those helping protect the borders are not.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter released Friday, congressional members said the guardsmen
could be defenseless targets without firearms.</LD>
<TE>   "Guard forces need the flexibility to carry out the mission, including
the ability to protect themselves in the event of danger," the letter
says.</TE>
<TE>   National Guardsmen are working alongside armed officers from the U.S.
Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The
soldiers do not have law-enforcement authority, but act in a supporting
role, searching cars and handling traffic.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter to Bush, the senators said that previous call-ups of the
National Guard to carry out border duties, including drug interdiction
efforts, allowed troops to carry firearms for protection.</TE>
<TE>   A number of the adjutant generals who oversee the state National
Guards also have been lobbying to arm their soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our soldiers should be armed," said Lt. Col. Joe Foster, a spokesman
for the Montana National Guard, which has deployed members to work at the
state's border crossings with Canada.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Defense Department has said it doesn't want guardsmen to
carry weapons because it wants to avoid military deployments along the
border.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to give the impression we were militarizing the
border," said Army Maj. Mike Whetston, of the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   Foster said Maj. Gen. John E. Prendergast, commander of Montana's
National Guard, has appealed to the administration to arm the guardsmen
since the deployment order came down in December. Soldiers began
deploying to the borders this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that in order to best protect themselves, and if
necessary, the citizenry, our solders need to be armed," Foster said.
"The reason we're up there is for security issues. Being armed is a
natural fit."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 157 border crossings, 124 are along the 4,000-mile border with
Canada and 33 are along the 2,000-mile line with Mexico. Last year, about
100 million people entered the United States from Canada, and 314 million
from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The Guard deployment came after concern over border security
heightened in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But problems at the border crossings had been highlighted earlier. In
1999, Ahmed Ressam was arrested trying to enter Washington state from
Canada with an explosive-laden car. He was convicted in Los Angeles of
smuggling, terrorist conspiracy and other charges stemming from what
investigators said was a plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>

<HD>Voices From the Past Open Doors to Different Ways of Life</HD>
<DH>Alaska: Oral history project blends recordings with photos, maps,
even video. Some of the 'chapters' feature tribal culture, scientific
exploration, even ascents of Mt. McKinley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN JOLING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FAIRBANKS, Alaska
</DL>
<LD>Sit down at one of two desktop computers at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks library and you can hear voices from the past come to
life.</LD>
<LD>   Project Jukebox, part of UAF's Oral History Program, blends digitized
recordings with historic photographs, maps, text and sometimes video
clips.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers can explore the history of the Yukon River village of Rampart,
hear commentary on 1930s photos from Barrow and listen to climbers
discuss pioneering ascents of Mt. McKinley.</LD>
<TE>   Technology could make the information available to millions via the
Internet, but human concerns keep the stories confined to the library.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the voices in the UAF collection are from Alaska Native
cultures, where the retelling of stories and traditions are governed by
strict codes. Putting them on the Internet, said oral history curator
William Schneider, leaves them vulnerable to uses that the groups did not
intend.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is now to try to work through some of the issues of
making this stuff available on the Web," Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   Project Jukebox started in 1988 when the Oral History Program, part of
the Alaska and Polar Regions Department of the Elmer E. Rasmuson Library,
faced budget cuts and looked for inexpensive ways to develop uses for
taped interviews.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate student, Felix Vogt, came up with the idea of digitizing
tape recordings. An Apple Computer grant helped launch the project.</TE>
<TE>   Today Project Jukebox has 29 programs with more than 400 hours of
interviews. In one, pioneering scientists at the Geophysical Institute
tell in their own words what it was like to design Arctic scientific
experiments to study the northern lights and other natural phenomena.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what science is all about," Schneider said proudly. "It's
innovative and it's creative. It's great stuff."</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to Alaska Native cultures, Schneider treats the
words as the UA Museum treats a fragile woven basket.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such a thing as cultural values," said Rosita Worl, executive
director of the Sealaska Heritage Foundation, devoted to preserving and
enhancing the cultures of Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The Southeast Alaska cultures have a strong tradition of intellectual
property, stories, songs, names, and crests. Native American property
historically has not been accorded the same protections as property of
other cultures, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the public doesn't know what these things mean to Native
people," Worl said.</TE>
<TE>   A traditional scholars council oversees Sealaska Heritage oral history
activities. The foundation has videotaped ceremonies but acknowledges
potential for abuse, for example, in a ceremony that calls forth spirits.</TE>
<TE>   They do not want their culture trivialized.</TE>
<TE>   "We like people to know about our culture, but we like to know it's
accurate and people know the context of it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   John Neuenschwander, professor of history at Carthage College in
Kenosha, Wis., who worked on ethical and legal guidelines for the
national Oral History Assn., said he was not familiar with UAF's policies
but the school would not be alone in its reluctance to post oral history
on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges and historical associations are more likely to post lists of
taped interviews rather than sound files, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most oral history programs are not willing to jump in there and make
everything available," Neuenschwander said, because of the potential for
harm.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking relief for a copyright violation is expensive, he said.
Institutions retain a control by making users sign agreements promising
not to misuse material.</TE>
<TE>   UAF oral historians consider themselves collaborators with community
members, who agree to be interviewed for Project Jukebox.</TE>
<TE>   "We try not to produce anything that hasn't been reviewed at least at
the local level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UAF research assistant Karen Brewster said UAF oral historians have
applied for a federal grant to pay for wider distribution. They would
like to revisit communities and ask people whether their words should be
distributed worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said a first step probably will be putting the information
on smaller networks controlled by museums, school districts or historical
associations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to work locally and regionally first, sort of testing the
waters," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There's no need to travel to Fairbanks to obtain the library's 8,845
audio tapes. More than 1,400 are indexed and can be ordered through the
interlibrary loan system. Casual users are not likely to go to the
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue there is degree of public exposure," Schneider said.</TE>

<HD>Forest Service to Scrutinize Limits on Sierra Logging</HD>
<DH>Timber: Regional forester says he fears the plan may give short
shrift to economic effects on rural areas and to fire risks. New review
alarms environmentalists.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>A new regional chief reviewing the Forest Service's sweeping
protections for the Sierra Nevada will visit logging sites, ski resorts
and grazing pastures to decide if the 11.5-million-acre plan is too
restrictive.</LD>
<LD>   Timber industry leaders are hopeful--and environmentalists
fearful--that Regional Forester Jack Blackwell will scale back protection
measures that took nearly a decade to develop.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no question in my mind he will take a good look and come up
with the right decision," said Phil Aune, vice president of the logging
industry's California Forestry Assn. in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   But environmentalists see the timber industry as eager to take an ax
to the Sierra Nevada framework.</TE>
<TE>   "They are looking at the review as a way to take the framework apart
and give them back a timber program," said Jay Watson, western regional
director for the Wilderness Society in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Blackwell said he has no preconceived ideas about the
plan for parts of 11 national forests stretching 460 miles from the
southern Sierra north of Los Angeles to the northern Sierra near Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But the 30-year Forest Service veteran acknowledges he's worried the
plan might not have paid enough attention to economic effects on rural
timber towns or the threat of catastrophic fires.</TE>
<TE>   Logging levels under the plan will decline significantly and efforts
to remove dead and dying trees to reduce fire risks in old-growth forests
would face tougher environmental guidelines than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see whether the thing is actually workable and can be
implemented," Blackwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell said he shares some of the same concerns about the Sierra
plan that Forest Service chief Dale Bosworth and others voiced about the
"one size fits all" approach that the Clinton administration adopted for
58 million acres of roadless areas in national forests.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the chief is right to say we need to make these ultimate
decisions forest plan by forest plan," Blackwell said. "I don't believe
it worked to try to do one environmental impact statement across the
entire U.S. and come up with 58 million acres and be site-specific about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, in the Sierra "it is a long, long way across 11 national
forests from north to south. There is a tremendous change in elevation
gradients and climates," Blackwell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Can one set of standards and guidelines apply to all those
conditions? I don't know the answer, but we are going to be looking hard
at that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The framework document took more than three years and $12 million to
complete. It had been in the works in various forms since the early 1990s
when the agency was forced to respond to environmental legal challenges
over the protection of the California spotted owl.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sierra is one mountain range," said Watson, who previously worked
to protect old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. "If the 11
forests are left to their own choices, it is bound to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Watson said the real issue is that the plan does something
environmentalists have been urging for years: "It removed logging
objectives as a distinct goal."</TE>
<TE>   "It says now that if timber can be produced as a result of reducing
the risk of wildfire, then so be it," he said. "But don't wake up on
Monday morning and start asking how we are going to meet our timber
quota.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the Forest Service has to be told what it can and cannot do
because they've abused the forests through loopholes over time. We've
gotten to this point because of those abuses of the past."</TE>
<TE>   During peak logging years in the 1980s, the 11 national forests in the
Sierra produced about 1 billion board feet of timber a year. A board foot
is one foot square by one inch thick. It takes about 10,000 board feet to
build a typical single-family home.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 10 years, the average has dropped to about 300 million
board feet, Forest Service spokesman Mark Mathes said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Sierra framework, the levels fall to 191 million board feet
the first five years, dropping to about 108 million board feet annually
after that. Of the 11.5 million acres, 4 million would be protected
"old-growth" areas.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration adopted the plan Dec. 28 but announced three
days later that it would conduct a yearlong review after heated criticism
from the timber industry, ranchers, private property owners and ski
resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the California Forestry Assn. were among those who
criticized the Bush administration initially for not voiding the plan and
returning it to the agency to be redone.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're encouraged by the review. Many of the things they are
looking at are the things we've been talking about since the decision was
announced," Aune said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious the current decision does not provide the best solution
for reducing catastrophic wildfires. And economic considerations will be
elevated into the decision," Aune said.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell said he's particularly sensitive to the effects on rural
communities dependent on federal timber to feed struggling sawmills.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell said the best example he's heard of problems with the
rigidity of the framework comes from ski resort operators within or
bordering national forests. They complain about the ban on logging any
trees larger than 20 inches in diameter in designated old-growth areas,
he said, and many of the resorts are bordered by such trees on three
sides.</TE>
<TE>   "They are saying, 'If we jump through all the hoops of expansion and
go through the master planning and the . . . process and get an
environmental impact statement and run through all the state and local
planning requirements--if we do all of that and it all finally shows that
we could expand a lift or increase a run, we're still surrounded by these
20-inch trees and your plan doesn't allow us to cut one.'</TE>
<TE>   "They say they are totally boxed in and can never expand. I don't know
if that is true or not. I don't know if there is any wiggle room,"
Blackwell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could sit in some sterile room somewhere and talk about that, but
I'd sooner go out to some typical ski area somewhere that is in some owl
habitat and stand at the bottom of the hill with a broad spectrum of
people, including some wildlife experts, and try to answer some of these
questions."</TE>

<HD>Fierce Fight in Afghan Valley Tests U.S. Soldiers and Strategy</HD>
<DH>How Operation Anaconda became the biggest infantry battle in the
war on terrorism, costing the lives of eight Americans</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is one in an occasional series chronicling
untold stories from the war in Afghanistan. This story was written by
Richard T. Cooper, with reporting by Geoffrey Mohan and Rone Tempest from
Bagram Air Base and John Daniszewski from the Shahi Kot valley. Cooper
reported from Washington. Also contributing were staff writers Esther
Schrader, John Hendren and Greg Miller and researcher Robin Cochran in
Washington and special correspondent Christian Retzlaff in Landstuhl,
Germany.

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>"You will never forget this," the colonel said, standing atop a
Humvee in front of a rusting Soviet-era hangar. "You will never forget
that man or woman on your right or left. You will never forget the fact
that you stood here in Afghanistan."</LD>
<LD>   It was Friday, March 1, D-day minus 1. Operation Anaconda was about to
begin.</LD>
<LD>   As darkness fell, pools of rain reflected odd shapes from the Black
Hawks and Chinooks waiting on the apron. Col. Frank Wiercinski was a
linebacker-sized silhouette against the hangar lights. It was hard to
hear over the roar of transport planes lumbering into the air, and
soldiers crowded close to catch his words.</LD>
<TE>   "We have two missions tonight," he said. "To defeat an enemy. And to
never leave a fallen comrade."</TE>
<TE>   Wiercinski commanded Anaconda's ground force: more than 1,500 U.S.
soldiers, 100 Australians, 100 other allied soldiers and 450 Afghan
fighters who had spent weeks preparing for this moment.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans came from the 101st Airborne Division, the 10th Mountain
Division and several Special Forces units. They included Delta Force
operatives--many distinguished by their civilian garb, beards and
goatees, the huge .45-caliber automatics some wore in mid-thigh holsters.
Those things, plus the occasional cowboy hat and a certain swagger.</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda, designed to crush the last known substantial force of Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, was conceived at a time when
many Americans thought the war was already over.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the folks back home nor Wiercinski himself knew that some of
these men would find themselves in the biggest infantry battle American
forces have faced against a hardened and determined enemy since Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, some people would question whether the intelligence had
been adequate, whether the troops had been properly briefed, whether
enough of the enemy were killed to make the battle worth the candle.</TE>
<TE>   To the professional soldiers who fought it, however, Anaconda became a
powerful demonstration of what the new light infantry can do in conflicts
like this. Fast, mobile ground forces using flexible tactics,
sophisticated battlefield electronics and close-in air power can seek out
an enemy, absorb stinging blows and still prevail.</TE>
<TE>   The coming battle would also test this generation of volunteer
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   At times, men who expected to dig in and wait for fleeing Al Qaeda
fighters would be forced to drop their rucksacks and run for cover,
dragging their wounded with them. Others would scoop out shallow foxholes
and wait only half-hidden for rescuers who could not reach them for
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Medics would throw their bodies over the wounded as shields against
enemy shells, hearing desperate prayers muttered beneath them.</TE>
<TE>   Searching red mud huts just vacated by the enemy, Ranger teams would
be astonished to find artfully positioned mortar pads, state-of-the-art
night-vision goggles and recoilless rifles that were equal or superior to
their own equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The hundreds of soldiers grouped around Wiercinski's Humvee belonged
to the best-equipped, most powerful fighting force on Earth. But there
was something else about them--a fact often lost in the rhetoric about
elite units and the superiority of U.S. military power.</TE>
<TE>   Most were just a few years out of high school, the mall and the warm
bath of American adolescence. With rare exceptions, they had not seen a
single day of combat against an enemy prepared to stand toe-to-toe with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Wiercinski understood that.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us have two questions always going through our minds," he
said. " 'Why?' and 'How will I do?'</TE>
<TE>   "As for 'Why?,' each and every one of you has to answer that for
yourself. . . . For me, it's 9/11: For those families that watched as
their loved ones never came home. For those firefighters, emergency
workers and policemen who charged up rather than came down. It's for
them. We do this for them.</TE>
<TE>   "How will you do in combat? You are thinking you've never been in
combat--'I don't know how I will do.'</TE>
<TE>   "You will be good in combat . . . because of who you are. You
volunteered. It started in here," he said, tapping his massive chest.
"You will do it for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Operation Anaconda, code-named for a Union Army plan to encircle and
strangle the Confederacy as the South American snake crushes its prey,
would thunder on for more than a week. Meticulously choreographed, it
would run like clockwork in some places. In others, it would prove the
military adage that no plan survives first contact with the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda would test the proud doctrine of never abandoning the dead or
wounded. And it would write large the lesson of "Black Hawk Down": Even
the soldiers of a high-tech superpower could be cast back to earlier
times, to the trapped, overpowered reality of the Battle of the Bulge in
World War II or the Chosin Reservoir in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Wiercinski, a 45-year-old, 6-foot-plus native of Pennsylvania,
addressed one last point as a video camera captured his blurry image in
the bad light.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two kinds of people out there," he said. "There's innocents
who don't want any part of this fight. And there are those out there who
want nothing better than to kill an American or kill a coalition fighter.
Do not be afraid to squeeze that trigger. You will know when, and you
will know why."</TE>
<TE>The Setting</TE>
<TE>   For more than 2,000 years, the steep ridgelines, caves and ravines of
the Shahi Kot valley in eastern Afghanistan had been the final redoubt,
the ultimate sanctuary for Afghan resistance fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Driven from their cities, villages and fields, conquered in other
mountain strongholds, generations of fighters had retreated to the
shelter of this valley, whose name means "The Place of the King."</TE>
<TE>   Tradition said no foreign army had ever successfully assailed it.</TE>
<TE>   Not Alexander the Great in 327 BC. Not Britain in the 1840s. Not the
Soviet Union, which lost 250 soldiers on a single day in 1987--about 200
of them reportedly stoned to death after capture.</TE>
<TE>   Milt Bearden, former CIA station chief in Pakistan, knows the valley
well. Beginning in 1985, he led the stepping-up of U.S. support for the
anti-Soviet moujahedeen--a Reagan administration decision that brought
defeat to Moscow but sowed dragon's teeth for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole area where Anaconda played out was always the last
redoubt," Bearden said from his home in Virginia. "When all else failed,
guys would fall back to there."</TE>
<TE>   The Soviets took more casualties in this valley than in any setting
since World War II, he said. "It really is the home-field advantage drawn
out to some exponential degree. There's not a square kilometer that
hasn't been used for an ambush of somebody."</TE>
<TE>   The air is so thin a man can sicken from lack of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   Ridges rising above 9,000 feet wall the valley on both sides. Down the
middle, waiting to split an invading force like a boulder splits a
stream, lies a massive outcropping. American planners nicknamed it "the
Whale," after a similar formation at Ft. Irwin, Calif., where many had
trained.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain sunlight burns the skin by day; at night, freezing cold can
bring on hypothermia.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. aid in years past and their own more recent initiative, the
Afghans had turned the heights into a modern-day fortress. Cave systems
were so complex that resistance fighters put mirrors at bends so that
sunlight could reach the far corners.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete reinforcement had been added, munitions stockpiled by the
ton, potential targets mapped in the valley below.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the pale green of another spring crept up the slopes toward
peaks still gripped by snow, the United States Army had decided to try
its hand.</TE>
<TE>Intelligence</TE>
<TE>   In early February, intelligence reports suggested that Arabs,
Chechens, Pakistanis, members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and
other Al Qaeda fighters and hard-core Taliban were trickling into the
Shahi Kot valley.</TE>
<TE>   They seemed to be concentrated around Sher Khan Khel, the northernmost
of three villages in the valley, and at Marzak, the southernmost village.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of their number ranged from 200 to 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   One senior official said efforts to be more precise were "hampered by
the confusing circumstances" on the ground. This was Taliban country, and
the intrigues of local warlords made the truth hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   Nor could spy planes and satellites get a clean look at enemy soldiers
burrowed in caves. And while electronic surveillance helped a little,
Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders had all but stopped communicating
electronically.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the exact numbers, one knowledgeable official said, "The
analysis I saw said this was going to be a very determined foe. They were
going to fight like hell, and they did."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but the whole blueprint for Anaconda was designed around the
notion that the enemy would try to escape, as it had done elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder individual soldiers were surprised when they ran into a
foe that stood its ground.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, U.S. commanders saw at least two compelling reasons to
act.</TE>
<TE>   First, Maj. Gen. F .L. "Buster" Hagenbeck, overall commander for
Anaconda, said later, "Indications were, they were planning an attack on
the interim government."</TE>
<TE>   Second, no one wanted to see Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters establish a
permanent base for guerrilla warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there were whispers that senior Al Qaeda or Taliban leaders
might be there--the prize fish who had so far gotten away.</TE>
<TE>The Plan</TE>
<TE>   By mid-February, preparation for Operation Anaconda was well advanced,
with the center of operations established at Bagram, 30 miles north of
the Afghan capital, Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The base, built by the Soviets in the 1980s, offered billets for more
than 2,000 troops and long runways for a fleet of aircraft that included
Apache, Cobra, Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters and C-130 transport
planes.</TE>
<TE>   American soldiers lived in 20-man tents heated with diesel stoves.
Before the tents could be pitched, land mines had to be cleared,
sometimes with the use of German shepherd sniffer dogs on long leashes.</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda would use three battalions of about 600 men each: two from
the 101st Airborne Division and one from Hagenbeck's 10th Mountain
Division.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces units and a smattering of coalition partners, notably
the 100 special operations soldiers from Australia, were also present.
The Aussies were chosen because they had proved themselves tough,
resilient operators who could handle covert reconnaissance missions, the
altitude and the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Some soldiers and Special Forces troops occupied old Soviet barracks,
one bearing a sign that said "Motel 6."</TE>
<TE>   American soldiers rehearsed their assignments at an air base in
Khowst, a city to the southeast, near the Pakistani border. A secret
refueling station, nicknamed "Texaco," was established near the Shahi Kot
valley.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Special Forces operators reequipped and trained Afghan
fighters under a local commander named Zia Lodin.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the Afghans to go after those guys. It's their country,"
Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda was heavily influenced by earlier experiences in the Tora
Bora region and by the liberation of major Afghan cities. Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters had resisted briefly on those occasions, then slipped
away--often through the porous lines of Afghan units that did not share
American priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda called for reversing the roles: American units would make a
highly visible show of force by being airlifted into positions covering
the major escape routes in the central and southern sectors of the Shahi
Kot valley.</TE>
<TE>   That was expected to send enemy fighters scurrying north, into the
guns of Zia Lodin's fighters, their Special Forces mentors and coalition
troops. If the enemy turned back south, the U.S. forces would be ready.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaconda name was somewhat misleading. Surrounding mountain ranges
that stretched all the way to Pakistan was impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, U.S. units would resemble a half-dozen or so individual
anacondas, encircling and destroying any Al Qaeda strongholds in their
path before digging in.</TE>
<TE>   One military intelligence officer said the model was more a hammer and
anvil than a boa constrictor.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most important targets were code-named Objective Remington
and Objective Ginger. Remington, a center of Al Qaeda strength, was near
Sher Khan Khel in the narrow valley between the Whale and the high East
Ridge. Objective Ginger lay farther south, overlooking a subsidiary
valley that opened onto a well-known escape route.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Eric Haupt, a brigade intelligence officer, acknowledged that
enemy forces might defend their strongholds or even counterattack rather
than run.</TE>
<TE>   "No plan survives the first round," Haupt said. "The command should
remember the military aphorism, 'Don't fight the plan. Fight the enemy.'
"</TE>
<TE>Early Success</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda was the kind of operation that advocates of light infantry
had envisioned for years. During the Cold War, the emphasis had been on
heavy mechanized divisions built around tanks, armored troop carriers and
heavy artillery. These were forces designed to face the likes of the
Soviet Union or Iraq on the plains or the desert.</TE>
<TE>   But Army leaders believed future enemies would choose to fight on
terrain where fleets of massive vehicles could not easily go--in jungles,
for instance, or mountainous valleys like Shahi Kot.</TE>
<TE>   Light infantry could reach such battlefields quickly--usually by air.
These forces could reposition to meet changing circumstances. And they
could fight on foot, with the weapons they carried--rifles, machine guns,
mortars, powerful modern-day explosives and, in the absence of heavy
artillery, close air support.</TE>
<TE>   There are drawbacks, including lack of protective armored vehicles and
the limited range of most light infantry weapons. A heavy division kills
at more than a mile. The "kill circle" for light infantry is barely
one-third of that.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning at dawn on Saturday, March 2, Operation Anaconda unfolded as
a model of light infantry warfare. A 20-minute aerial bombardment
preceded the troops, and most encountered moderate resistance when their
big Chinooks dropped down.</TE>
<TE>   At Landing Zone 1 near Sher Khan Khel, troops from the 1st Battalion
of the 10th Mountain Division took heavy mortar fire as they landed, but
they quickly secured a nearby compound.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Sgt. Shawn, who did not want to use his last name, said 85 men
from his company landed five minutes after the mortar barrage began. They
split into platoons of 25 to 30 men and took over hills east, west and
south of the village.</TE>
<TE>   "We were expecting them to come from the south," he said of the enemy.
"They tried to come, but we bombed the hell out of them."</TE>
<TE>   Moving into the village carefully, Shawn's platoon found that enemy
fighters had fled. Blankets on their beds were still warm and tea was
boiling atop a propane heater.</TE>
<TE>   "It was still tense, because I was worried about booby traps," Shawn
said.</TE>
<TE>   He found surprisingly sophisticated equipment: an 82-millimeter
mortar, a 57-millimeter recoilless rifle, rocket-propelled grenades,
blasting caps and explosives, and the same kind of night-vision equipment
American soldiers used.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a helluva lot more fancy than we give them credit for," Shawn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the seven landing sites were secured within hours, and American
and coalition forces had established their designated positions.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened at the seventh landing zone and at the north end of
the valley threatened to stand the whole operation on its head.</TE>
<TE>Early Failure</TE>
<TE>   Zia Lodin's fighters, along with the Australian contingent and U.S.
Special Forces operators, were to push in quickly to the village of Sher
Khan Khel near the north end of the Whale and destroy enemy fighters
fleeing the Americans positioned to the south.</TE>
<TE>   That part of Operation Anaconda was simply blown to pieces--with
cascading consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The pickup trucks bearing Zia Lodin's force moved slowly on roads that
rain had turned to mud. No sooner had the caravan entered the narrow
mouth of the valley than a hail of mortar and machine-gun fire came
crashing down.</TE>
<TE>   Two Afghan fighters were killed almost immediately. So was Special
Forces Chief Warrant Officer Stanley L. Harriman, 34, who was driving one
of the trucks. Two dozen others were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghans tried to hang on, but they had fallen into what seemed to
be an ambush.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like they knew we were coming," one U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Their trucks destroyed, the Afghans withdrew. Before they pulled back,
according to the commander of Australia's special forces, Brig. Duncan
Lewis, Australian observers pinpointed several Al Qaeda positions, which
were later destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   But the damage to the coalition operation had been done.</TE>
<TE>   Willy-nilly, the role of the American units was transformed. As a
senior Defense Department official put it, "This one rotated almost 180
degrees."</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck later defended the retreat as unavoidable. Nonetheless, the
rout of Zia Lodin's force created what Wiercinski called a "worst-case
scenario."</TE>
<TE>   With the threat from the north eliminated, enemy fighters could
concentrate on the Americans.</TE>
<TE>'Hell's Halfpipe'</TE>
<TE>   Objective Ginger is an unprepossessing piece of high ground
overlooking a cleft in mountains of the Eastern Ridge that offers an
escape route out of the Shahi Kot valley--a trail running all the way to
the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   Securing Ginger fell to Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 87th
Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, based at Ft. Drum, N. Y.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Company packed heavy. Its members stuffed their big rucksacks
with extra ammunition, explosives and other equipment. Medic Eddie "Doc"
Rivera, a 21-year-old street-talking New Yorker, griped at the weight of
his aid bag, but Staff Sgt. Joseph Window ordered him to pack it to the
limit.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," Window said.</TE>
<TE>   The sergeant was right. Like the Afghan force, Charlie Company got
into trouble almost at once, and its 18-hour fight to survive would
become one of the most dramatic stories of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces operatives and other reconnaissance teams had done
their best to scout safe landing sites for the Chinooks. But as one light
infantry expert said ruefully, there are only so many places a big
transport helicopter can set down in mountainous country, and a smart
enemy can figure them out.</TE>
<TE>   So every Anaconda landing was a roll of the dice. All along the
central and southern reaches of the valley, helicopters were taking that
gamble; troops landing in the shadow of the ridges were expected to move
quickly toward objectives on higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly it worked, but there were exceptions--places where undetected
Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters had dug in on the ridges and declined to
run.</TE>
<TE>   First Lt. Aaron O'Keefe, 23, of Brandon, Vt., landed in one such spot.
His assignment was to help secure a position blocking the access to
Ginger. He expected a quiet landing, with time to reach his position, dig
in and wait for enemy fighters coming back down the valley after clashing
with the Afghan force.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the mission was briefed," O'Keefe said, "it wasn't going to
be the way it was. We packed pretty heavy, because we were going to sit
awhile."</TE>
<TE>   The way it was, when he led Charlie Company's 2nd Platoon off its
CH-47 Chinook just after dawn, O'Keefe encountered mortar shells,
rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire. The landing site was just
across the narrow valley from the towering East Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in, got off the bird and headed toward the left," O'Keefe
said. "As soon as the birds took off, that's when rounds started going
off."</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning," Rivera recalled, "it was, 'Whoa . . . I know they
ain't trying to fire at us.' Everybody was all, 'Bring it on!' They had
the game face on."</TE>
<TE>   But when "mortar rounds start hitting, you hear, 'Doc, Doc,' and I
said . . . 'This is real.' "</TE>
<TE>   They were caught on a hill below the ridgeline, unable to maneuver
toward their objective. O'Keefe's men quickly dropped their rucksacks,
70-plus pounds of extra ammunition and other equipment, to move faster.</TE>
<TE>   They followed the lieutenant into a dry creek bed for what proved to
be illusory shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Enemy gunners were zeroing in on their positions with mortars. There
was no time for the Americans to unpack their own mortars, and rifle fire
was ineffective at such a distance.</TE>
<TE>   Already, some mortar rounds were landing in the 2nd Platoon's midst,
flinging shrapnel in all directions. Once accurately aimed, the enemy
mortars could wipe out the platoon in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "When the first really serious one hit, it hit right in the middle of
the 1st Platoon," O'Keefe said. "They got hit very bad. It took out a
handful of them. We got up [and] picked up as many men as we could to try
to get out of the kill zone."</TE>
<TE>   First to go down was medic Rivera's friend Ricardo Miranda, 20, of
Salinas, Calif. He was crying out about his back, but when Rivera
checked, he found that the wound was in Miranda's buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I said: 'You dumb-ass. It's your ass that's hit.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rivera packed bandages into the wound, wrapped Miranda's right hand,
which had also been cut by shrapnel, and moved on. Miranda was smiling
now at Rivera's chiding. He helped grab other casualties and move them up
the ditch.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a little bit of a shock first," Miranda recalled. "I looked at
my hand and my body and said, 'Wow, I've got hit.' It hurt a little bit
more to see my guys being hit. Living with these guys for so long is like
building a brothership. We are a family. If one of us gets hit, it really
hurts."</TE>
<TE>   For Sgt. Robert McCleave of El Toro, Calif., another 10th Mountain
soldier hit by shrapnel, "it was like somebody just pressed the pause
button on the VCR. . . . I was turning around and saw other soldiers who
had been hit, and I said, 'OK, this is my time to yell now.' "</TE>
<TE>   Already, word of the stiff resistance had reached Bagram, and air
support was on its way. Six Apache gunships began strafing the ridges,
dodging back to "Texaco" to refuel, then returning despite being riddled
with groundfire. Air Force F-16s thundered in low with more powerful
weapons. High-altitude B-52s dropped radio-controlled "smart bombs."</TE>
<TE>   "We had just about any kind of aircraft available and just about any
kind of ammunition available to us," O'Keefe said. "They put everything,
everything, on them.</TE>
<TE>   "God love them, they're on my Christmas list now."</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that the enemy was able to retreat into the caves when
the air power approached.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as you heard the jet engine or a helicopter propeller, all
fire would cease," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Down below, dragging and carrying their increasing number of wounded,
members of the 2nd Platoon inched their way 500 yards toward a natural
depression the men soon began to call Hell's Halfpipe for its resemblance
to skateboard structures back home.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the halfpipe, where other members of Charlie Company had
taken shelter, O'Keefe's men had to cross about 30 yards of open ground.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera described how he psyched himself up for the dash:</TE>
<TE>   "I said: 'I gotta go. Here we go. Here we go. I'm ready. I'm ready
now.' I went. All I saw was dirt kicking up around my feet. I just dove
into it. It was hard rocks and stuff. I just dove and then I
half-crawled."</TE>
<TE>   Down in the halfpipe, Charlie Company was already missing the
rucksacks. They had left behind a lot of ammunition. And Rivera was the
only medic who still had his medical bag.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," Sgt. Window had said.</TE>
<TE>   The casualties were stunned, silent.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to yell: 'Tell me what's wrong with you! You have to hurry up!'
" Rivera said. "To see someone who sleeps next to you, who's so shocked
he can't even talk . . . "</TE>
<TE>   The sides of the halfpipe offered only partial protection from fire
that was coming from several directions. Soldiers began scooping
"hasties" out of the rocky soil, small, body-size depressions they called
"Ranger graves."</TE>
<TE>   Soon half the platoon was up on the lip of Hell's Halfpipe, using
suppressing fire to keep the enemy from getting a good look at where they
were hiding.</TE>
<TE>   "We could see them, but they were too far," O'Keefe said. "We were
trying to lay rounds in there to maybe keep their heads down, maybe get
lucky and hit one."</TE>
<TE>   Several times, O'Keefe thought he spotted antiaircraft missiles--maybe
Stingers, he thought, the weapons CIA agents had supplied in abundance to
the anti-Soviet moujahedeen. He could see misty white trails arching up
toward U.S. planes.</TE>
<TE>   As the long day wore on under a harsh sun, casualties mounted. Rivera
and the other medics and a couple of volunteers divvied up the contents
of his bag and did what they could.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the wounded were falling asleep. Rivera would prod them awake
to stave off shock.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes mortar rounds can be seen and heard as they plummet through
the air, and when they came, Rivera and the others would lie on top of
the wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hear them saying their prayers," he said. " 'Please don't let
it hit me. Please don't let it hit me.' The mortar would hit, close
enough that you'd feel the dirt or your ears were ringing."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the wounded kept fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera was shouting the names of his company members, checking on his
friend Miranda and on another wounded soldier, 21-year-old Kyle McGovern
of Merrimack, N. H.</TE>
<TE>   "McGovern! Miranda! Are you OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm all right," he heard someone yell back. "I'm still here. I
just need some water."</TE>
<TE>   These were men he had trained with, lived with and sometimes had to
put up with. In training, you did not love them unconditionally, Rivera
recalled. Now you did.</TE>
<TE>   "I could've hated the man next to me that got shot. But you don't want
nobody to die. You see fear on everyone's face. You see fear on a
casualty's face because they can't run, they can't maneuver. You can't
show them any fear."</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscing afterward, Rivera looked at O'Keefe's sunburned skin--the
personal souvenir of each man who fought in the thin air of the Shahi Kot
valley--and said he had brought back something besides a sunburn.</TE>
<TE>   "We already got something," he said. "Lives saved."</TE>
<TE>   When night finally closed in on Charlie Company's 18-hour ordeal, the
tide turned. With their night-vision goggles, they could move. And the
evacuation helicopters could begin to slip in beside Hell's Halfpipe.</TE>
<TE>   It was well after midnight on Sunday, March 3, when the last men
scrambled aboard the last bird. On the flight line at Bagram, waiting for
them, were all the senior commanders.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight of the 86 soldiers in Charlie Company were wounded, but
none was killed and no one was left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm prouder than a father about my guys," O'Keefe said. "I got a
platoon full of sons, and that's what I've got to do, bring sons home."</TE>
<TE>   A large piece of the plan--Zia Lodin's mission to drive down from the
north and secure the village of Sher Khan Khel--had ended in a rout. The
American units sent to secure Objective Ginger got pinned down, took
heavy casualties and had to be evacuated under the over of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Anaconda's commanders were not discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. David Gray, operations officer for the 10th Mountain
Division, looked back on the situation later and said:</TE>
<TE>   "From the soldiers' perspective . . . it was a scary situation, but
from our position, what that air assault did for us was identify where
the decisive point on the battlefield was.</TE>
<TE>   "We found the enemy the first day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Sunday was a day of regrouping and repositioning--and giving the
enemy a full dose of air power. Among other things, huge,
earth-shuddering thermobaric explosives were used for the first time in
Anaconda to send their slow-release pulse of destructive energy deep into
caves and tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   It was like shuffling all the pieces on a chessboard in the middle of
a game. But that was what light infantry was supposed to be good at.</TE>
<TE>   Units caught on low ground were pulled out. Forces were repositioned
and concentrated on higher ground. The new mission had two parts: Clean
out pockets of well-armed and determined fighters who remained on the
valley floor, and destroy the caves, bunkers, observation posts and
firing positions that honeycombed the Eastern Ridge and parts of the
Whale.</TE>
<TE>   It was the mountain equivalent of urban warfare, like clearing a city
room by room, building by building, block by block: slow, dangerous,
uncertain work.</TE>
<TE>   And it began to snow.</TE>
<TE>   For light infantry in a place like the Shahi Kot valley, where quick
reflexes and flexibility are critical, there is nothing like a
helicopter. And Chinooks were everywhere as the Army adjusted to the new
battlefield reality.</TE>
<TE>   But the big birds' vulnerability to ground fire--especially to
rocket-propelled grenades--is no secret. The greatest danger generally
came when a helicopter pilot cut his air speed and prepared to land, or
when he had to hover close to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Army has a system to deal with those moments. Gunners positioned
in the side doors, along with any friendly ground troops, lay down
torrents of gunfire meant to deny an enemy the minute or two needed to
stand up, aim a grenade launcher and fire.</TE>
<TE>   The system is far from perfect.</TE>
<TE>   And before sunrise, when two Chinooks rumbled into a mountain site
east of Ginger to insert special operations teams and supplies, they
encountered heavy fire.</TE>
<TE>   One helicopter pulled out successfully, but the other, carrying a team
of Navy SEALS, was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade that apparently
ruptured hydraulic lines inside the cargo bay.</TE>
<TE>   As the chopper veered to escape, Petty Officer Neil C. Roberts, 32, of
Woodland, Calif., slipped off the rear ramp and fell to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   A Predator observation aircraft flying overhead provided distant
commanders with real-time video of Roberts being captured.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw him on the Predator, being dragged off by three Al Qaeda men,"
Hagenbeck said later.</TE>
<TE>   But the men and crews aboard the two Chinooks did not. They set down
not far away to assess damage. Only then did they realize that Roberts
was gone.</TE>
<TE>   What happened during the next 12 hours or so remains cloaked in
confusion, but official reports and other sources suggest the following
sequence of events:</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter that had been hit appeared too damaged to fly, so its
crew and 10 SEALS crowded into the other chopper. It climbed to safety
just as Al Qaeda fighters closed in.</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby village, the surviving helicopter shed all its passengers
except a small assault force and returned to the original area to search
for Roberts, who, unknown to the rescuers, was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Anaconda's commanders were organizing a larger rescue
effort. Before long, the area where Roberts fell turned into a battle
within the battle.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the assault force returned to the scene by the original
surviving helicopter, other units arrived--bringing with them a storm of
air power but also the seeds of greater heartbreak.</TE>
<TE>   As dawn approached, two Chinooks moved to within a mile or so of where
Roberts had been lost, but they fell into an apparent ambush. Both
offloaded their Special Forces teams under heavy fire. One bird pulled
away; the other was disabled.</TE>
<TE>   A large number of enemy fighters began to converge as the Special
Forces scrambled to set up defensive positions.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces teams inflicted heavy casualties on their
attackers, driving them back again and again with the help of air power.</TE>
<TE>   But six more Americans died, apparently hit in the opening minutes of
the firefight.</TE>
<TE>   As daylight came and the fighting raged too hot for rescue helicopters
to venture in, 11 more were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   A small team of Australians in a mountain observation post could see
enemy forces massing for an assault. The Australians helped call in
airstrikes but were in no position to join the fight.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 12 hours, U.S. jet fighters, AC-130 gunships and attack
helicopters flew in almost nonstop combat. They attacked exposed enemy
fighters again and again, attempting to create a cordon of fire around
the Americans trapped with the downed helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   But they were constrained by their repeated need to refuel and by the
fact that enemy fighters were often so close to the U.S. perimeter that
airstrikes would have risked hitting friendly forces.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the aerial pounding and the fire from U.S. ground troops
began to tell. In the early evening, almost 18 hours after the first
helicopter was hit, three helicopters dashed in to evacuate the
beleaguered men.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the bloodiest episode in Operation Anaconda, and it showed
the price of relying on helicopters and the policy of retrieving dead and
wounded soldiers no matter the risk.</TE>
<TE>   To the Army, what happened was part of war: a tragic but acceptable
loss.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in these units understand they will take casualties. You
wouldn't find anyone in the Army who believes six or seven casualties
makes an operation unsuccessful," one officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we're getting over that idea in America," the officer added.
"I don't think anyone in the Army expects bloodless victories."</TE>
<TE>   As for the rescue and retrieval policy, Hagenbeck said bluntly: "Each
life taken from us is absolutely terrible. We mourn each one, and for
their bravery in a noble cause, we honor them. And I will tell you the
soldiers that went in, they went in to get a buddy out. And we will
always do that."</TE>
<TE>The Tide Turns</TE>
<TE>   It was Tuesday, March 5, D-day plus 3. Some planners had thought
Operation Anaconda would be over.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the enemy had just crippled two helicopters and killed seven
more of the U.S. armed forces' toughest fighters on a scrap of mountain
ground.</TE>
<TE>   But there would be no more such losses by U.S. or coalition forces in
this battle, nor, in all likelihood, would they again face an enemy
capable of mounting such an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the enemy reinforcements that intelligence analysts believed
had slipped into the Shahi Kot valley from neighboring areas, U.S.
firepower was inflicting casualties the enemy could not withstand.</TE>
<TE>   Back in February, Col. Gray said, U.S. commanders had pondered what
might happen if Anaconda did not follow the expected script and the enemy
decided to stand its ground and "fight American soldiers toe-to-toe."</TE>
<TE>   It was a possibility the planners felt they could adjust to. And when
the battle turned out just that way, Gray said, it "played exactly to the
strengths of the American military."</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the resources in terms of air power and intelligence to
bring to bear against him," he said, "and the enemy simply made a very,
very bad mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Anaconda would stretch into the following week, as U.S. and then
Canadian forces worked their way through lingering pockets of resistance
and checked myriad caves. But Anaconda was essentially over.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments would go on over body counts, the vulnerability of
helicopters, the need to avoid "hot" landing sites and more.</TE>
<TE>   So far as advocates of a lighter military were concerned, however, the
new Army and its air power allies had carried the field.</TE>
<TE>   The proof, as they saw it, was the scene that greeted 1st Lt. Joe
Claburn, 25, of Montgomery Ala., on Thursday, March 7--D-day plus 5--when
he flew over the Whale on a resupply mission.</TE>
<TE>   Below him, he said, were "American after American in position along
the ridge line. We overflew all these American units.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great sight."</TE>

<HD>Fear Factor at Work as Home Prices Soar Higher</HD>
<DH>Economy: Bidding wars in Southland continue, reviving memories of
the collapse of a decade ago. But experts say this bubble is different.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spiraling home prices, bidding wars for desirable and even
not-so-desirable properties, panicked home buyers afraid they're about to
be shut out of the market--Terry Harman of Long Beach has seen all this
before.</LD>
<LD>   That's what the Southland real estate scene was like in 1989, the last
time Harman bought a home.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the 61-year-old water utility executive contemplates making
full-price offers on $380,000 fixer-uppers with pea-green shag, he
wonders if he might not be buying at another precipitous peak.</LD>
<TE>   "In my gut," Harman said, "it feels like we're in a bubble."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the numbers are enough to give any potential home buyer
pause. The Southern California housing market is roaring, with prices
hitting records almost every month for the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the median home price last month rose 15%
compared with a year ago, to $237,000, while in Orange County the median
was up 11%, to $317,000.</TE>
<TE>   The last time prices ran up this far, this fast, a spectacular crash
was just around the bend. Home prices first slipped and then plunged,
losing as much as 20% of their value each year as the defense industry
collapsed, the Southland economy fell apart and people fled for better
prospects elsewhere. Homeowners who remained were trapped in houses worth
far less than their mortgages and neighborhoods were gutted by
foreclosures. It was the bursting of a classic bubble--when prices are
driven far above a level that can be sustained in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Will it be different this time? So far, economists and real estate
experts see little evidence that such a massive crash is in the offing.
They agree, however, that the residential market is showing some of the
classic signs of overheating, as buyers battle ever more desperately for
an inadequate supply of available homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be a mini-bubble developing, but I don't think it's
anything close to what we saw in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Los
Angeles and Orange counties," said Ross DeVol, director of regional
studies for the Santa Monica-based Milken Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are different now, economists say, with lower interest
rates, a more diversified local economy, less real estate speculation and
plenty of entry-level buyers--all in sharp contrast to what the market
faced in 1991. Still, bubbles are usually apparent only after they burst,
and the twin fears of paying too much or being priced out of the market
have many buyers running scared.</TE>
<TE>   The thought that prices could keep climbing is what prompted Maryann
Marks of Costa Mesa to outbid several other buyers on a home in the
upscale Orange County neighborhood of Mesa Verde North earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Marks, who recently sold her townhouse so she could move up to a
single-family home in the $350,000 range, at first tried to be cagey by
bidding below the listed price of houses on the market. But after losing
several houses to other buyers who were willing to pay the seller's
asking price, or more, she changed her tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid if I didn't [offer close to the asking price], prices
would go up more, and I would be unable to buy," said Marks, who works at
a land planning and landscape design firm in Irvine. "If I hadn't offered
that amount, someone else would have."</TE>
<TE>   Such desperation is leading to bidding wars in many neighborhoods,
said David Stratton, an agent at DBL Realtors in Los Angeles, who said
four of the seven homes he's currently representing in escrow drew
multiple offers.</TE>
<TE>   One Westwood home generated six bids in three days, including one from
Stratton's client that pushed the price up by $100,000 over the
$1.15-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a frustrating time for buyers," Stratton said, "because it seems
when a good home comes on the market, a lot of people already are looking
at it."</TE>
<TE>   The typical home in Los Angeles or Orange counties sells in 27 days,
about half the time houses have historically waited between listing and
sale, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory of existing homes is shrinking as well. At the current
pace of selling, Los Angeles County has enough homes on the market as of
today to meet demand for three months, compared with a historical average
of 10 months. Orange County has less than a two-month supply--breaking
the record low, and well below the usual nine-month supply.</TE>
<TE>Buyers Forced to Expand Searches</TE>
<TE>   Thin inventories and rising prices are pushing clients from Silver
Lake and Los Feliz--once a refuge for buyers priced out of Westside
neighborhoods--to areas farther eastward in Mount Washington, Eagle Rock
and west to the San Fernando Valley, said agent Hattie Ramirez of Los
Feliz's Prudential California Realty. Buyers who start looking in
Inglewood or the Crenshaw District, agents said, wind up grabbing homes
in nearby South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to buy in Orange County are finding themselves scanning
ads for homes in Corona and Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   It's when these starter homes move out of the reach of first-time
buyers, real estate experts say, that people should really start worrying
about a bubble.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, we'll hit a ceiling," said Ted Grose, president-elect
of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers. "Prices are already
outpacing the growth in income, and people's earnings are going to limit
who can buy a house."</TE>
<TE>   It was stagnation in the entry-level home-buying market that signaled
the beginning of the end in 1989, said real estate analyst John Karevoll
of DataQuick Information Systems Inc., which monitors price and sales
trends.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, interest rates of 9% to 11%, combined with prices that rose
as much as 5% from month to month, eventually shut out most first-time
buyers, Karevoll said. That was true even as wealthier buyers continued
to snap up higher-priced properties.</TE>
<TE>   Today's lower interest rates, and the ease of borrowing money, have so
far kept the pipeline filled with first-time buyers, mortgage brokers
said. Even though home prices have climbed, the typical borrower is
actually paying less per month, thanks to rates that are near record
lows.</TE>
<TE>   The mortgage payment for the median home--the point at which half of
home buyers are paying more and half less--was $1,240 last month,
compared with $1,301 in 1991, even though the median home price itself
has risen by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "Mortgage payments are lower in raw dollars than they were then, let
alone in inflation-adjusted dollars," Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   The low rates also mean fewer borrowers have to resort to
adjustable-rate mortgages today than in the late 1980s. ARMs generally
offer lower introductory rates than more traditional fixed-rate
mortgages, but the payments can spike if interest rates rise, squeezing
homeowners' budgets and increasing the risk of foreclosure. Only about
25% of today's borrowers use ARMs, compared with 70% to 75% during the
last peak, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders are also far more liberal than they were 15, 10 or even five
years ago, brokers said. While most mortgage lenders want monthly
payments to equal no more than 33% of the borrower's total income, some
lenders are willing to give loans that result in payments of 50% or even
60% of a well-qualified buyer's pay, said Allen Bond, president of the
mortgage broker group's Southern California chapter. That expands the
pool of potential buyers and increases what they can spend.</TE>
<TE>Easier Borrowing Has Its Downside</TE>
<TE>   Better credit and lending information, including the growth of
so-called credit scoring, have allowed lenders to accommodate more
borrowers, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal loan terms could be a problem, of course, if the economy
worsens rather than continues to recover, said the Milken Institute's
DeVol. In the 1990s, overextended buyers were more likely to lose homes
to foreclosure. So far, however, the foreclosure rate has remained low.</TE>
<TE>   Another trend that real estate experts aren't seeing as much of this
time around is speculative buying. In the late 1980s, investors scooped
up houses, paid for minimal improvements and sold a few months later for
substantial profits--usually without ever spending a night in the home.</TE>
<TE>   That was ultimately bad news for neighborhoods. Speculative buyers
were much more likely to walk away from homes that didn't appreciate in
value, said mortgage broker Grose, and the foreclosures that resulted
further depressed values as banks slashed prices for quick sales.</TE>
<TE>   Still, few economists expect such a worst-case scenario will develop,
particularly with the Southland economy on the mend.</TE>
<TE>   "By the second half of the year, prices will probably flatten out,"
DeVol said, "but I don't think you're going to see prices fall."</TE>
<TE>   DeVol points to Silicon Valley, once the hottest home-buying market in
the nation, where the median price has fallen about 8% since the dot-com
crash.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make a much stronger case that there was a housing bubble
developing in Silicon Valley," DeVol said, "and home prices have not
dropped that much."</TE>

<HD>Sound Advice From a 14-Time Loser</HD>
<DH>Oscars: As a technical nominee, he knows his chances are often only
as good as the film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some things you should know about being Kevin O'Connell: He owns a
tuxedo after years of renting. The acceptance speech he's never given
hasn't changed substantially over the years, although now he would thank
his wife of seven months, Heather.</LD>
<LD>   He would thank her if it comes to that, and yet O'Connell knows it
won't. He has been in this position too many times before--nominated for
an Oscar but attached to the wrong ticket, a guy who did admirable work
on a movie that was otherwise dismissed as a piece of low art.</LD>
<LD>   If O'Connell's name isn't called tonight, his tally will be 15
nominations, zero wins. Among active artists, these are statistics
matched only by singer-composer Randy Newman. With his two nominations
this year, for both his score and an original song on "Monsters, Inc.,"
Newman risks pushing his Oscar-less total to 16.</LD>
<TE>   O'Connell, a rerecording mixer with more than 20 years of experience
on some of the biggest Hollywood films in recent memory, is nominated in
the category "achievement in sound," where the competition includes
"Moulin Rouge," "Black Hawk Down," "Amelie" and "The Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell is up for "Pearl Harbor," the widely panned blockbuster
released last summer by the Walt Disney Co. Though it came out to bugles
of hype and grossed nearly $200 million domestically, the film is
strictly an Oscar wannabe.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its technical wizardry, none of its four nominations are in
marquee categories, which means Disney hasn't cared to trumpet it with
the kind of multimillion-dollar publicity campaign touting "Lord of the
Rings" and "A Beautiful Mind" as achievements in everything.</TE>
<TE>   And so, though O'Connell didn't conceive the hackneyed love story in
"Pearl Harbor," or overact in it, he will likely be held responsible, in
a way. It was the same in 1984, when he was nominated for "Dune," and
1998, when he went to the big Oscar dance with "Armageddon."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the sound guy's lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm the guy at the Oscars, when somebody loses, I've had their
wives come up to me and say, 'Will you do me a favor? Will you please
talk to my husband? He's very upset,' " says O'Connell, interviewed on
the Sony lot on a recent weekday morning, before he started another long
day mixing "Spider-Man," the film version of the comic book character due
out in May.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'Listen, dude, you're a young guy, you've got the rest of your
life ahead of you.' "</TE>
<TE>   This afternoon, instead of working, O'Connell will put on his tux and
go to the Kodak Theatre for the Academy Awards ceremony. It is a ritual
he says he loves, even if it has yet to end in triumph. He says this
without bitterness or pretension, which is why it sounds so odd, coming
from a guy who works in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The only year that I went thinking I had a chance--and it's not
because I thought it, it's because everyone in the world was telling us,
'You guys are a shoo-in'--was for 'Top Gun,' " he says. "And we lost that
year to 'Platoon.'</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since then, I've always known that we weren't the winning film.
I've known it going in."</TE>
<TE>   With all his nominations, O'Connell, 44, has become something of a
legend within the ranks of those who keep track of such things. But he is
also among the elite in his field.</TE>
<TE>   Although he politely deflected discussion of his income ("Just say I
make what a doctor or lawyer makes," he said), sought-after mixers can
earn healthy six-figure salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Rerecording mixers are responsible for giving definition to all of the
sound components compiled for a film--and these can number into the
thousands--blending and balancing for maximum clarity. While sound
editors and production mixers do the actual compiling of material, from
dialogue to explosions, O'Connell and his partner, Greg Russell, are at
the controls when it comes time to use them, acting as an advisor and
collaborator with the film's director.</TE>
<TE>   In this way, O'Connell has developed longtime working relationships
with big-name directors Rob Reiner, Lawrence Kasdan, Tony Scott and
"Pearl Harbor's" Michael Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if the names were Spielberg, Soderbergh and Scorsese,
O'Connell would have his award by now, but if he harbors any resentment
about this he betrays none. Yes, he wouldn't mind having a few "dialogue
movies" such as "Gosford Park" and "A Beautiful Mind" come along, but
mostly because O'Connell has met his share of retired sound guys with
hearing problems.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Russell, O'Connell is currently blending the high-octane
melange of sounds, most of them fabricated, for "Spider-Man." This means
16-hour days amid a tidal wave of noise. At home, O'Connell says, he
keeps the volume on his TV low.</TE>
<TE>   Generally speaking, the mixer hears a movie six decibels louder than
the filmgoer--and this at a time when many audience members feel blasted
out of their seats as it is. O'Connell feels their pain, and tries to
massage a collaborative lowering of the volume in the screening room. "If
I want to do this job for another 10 years," he says, "I can't be doing
it at the levels I'm doing it now."</TE>
<TE>   In O'Connell's world, a mixing stage named after Cary Grant, the films
and their myriad sound elements are "busy shows" with deadlines looming.
After "Spider-Man," he heads right into work on "Men in Black 2." After
that, it's "Dreamcatcher," directed by Kasdan and based on the Stephen
King novel.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe more so than actors or directors, sound technicians give truth
to the cliche: Just being nominated is an honor, because mixers and
sound-effects wizards are selected by their peers in the academy, who
choose five nominees out of several hundred films.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the voting goes Academy-wide, and all bets are off.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Pearl Harbor," the film was a particular sound
challenge, says director Bay, because there were so many environments
depicted.</TE>
<TE>   "You are in planes, you are in the sky, you are underwater, you are in
ships," Bay says. "There are so many different types of atmospheres where
[the action] happens."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, because some Academy members view nominated films at home,
the sound O'Connell and others slaved over is heard coming out of a TV,
not the lush THX or Dolby sound systems familiar in movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you while looking at a movie [where] the dubbing mixer was
responsible, or [where] the production mixer [the on-set recordist] was
responsible. But very few people who are voting have that ability," says
director Tony Scott, for whom O'Connell has worked on "Crimson Tide" and
"Top Gun," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, O'Connell is nominated this year along with Russell and
production mixer Peter Devlin. If they win, O'Connell will speak.</TE>
<TE>   If he has had any complaints, it's that seating for nominees of his
ilk can be less than desirable. There have been years, in fact, when
O'Connell could hear his name being called among the nominees but
couldn't even see the stage.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell's own first foray into show business was brief: At 18, he
got a job as a projectionist at Twentieth Century Fox Studios, only to
discover after a month that he had to take an extensive test to qualify
for a union.</TE>
<TE>   He failed the test miserably, he says, and subsequently tried his hand
at firefighting for a year, joining the L.A. County Fire Department. One
day, he came home from battling a brush fire in Sylmar; his hands and
face were burnt, and his arms were chewed up by yucca plants. He'd lost
an alarming amount of weight. He was 19. His mother took one look at him
and said, "This is killing you; let me get you a job."</TE>
<TE>   Skippy O'Connell worked as a secretary for the head of the sound
department at Twentieth Century Fox, and she got her son a job at Warner
Hollywood. As a rerecording mixer, his first credited movie was the 1982
comedy "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid." His first nomination, at age 24, was
for the 1983 drama "Terms of Endearment."</TE>
<TE>   The film won a host of awards, including best picture, best actress
and best director. But the award for best sound went to the team on "The
Right Stuff," which also took home the honors for best sound-effects
editing. O'Connell's streak had begun.</TE>
<TE>   By then, sound achievement had evolved from its early days, when it
was considered part of a film's overall special effects. Only one award
was given, and the recipient was a studio's sound department. In 1969,
when Jack Solomon and Murray Spivack won for their sound-by credit on
"Hello, Dolly!" on-set recordists and rerecording mixers began to come
out from behind Oscar glory.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one else out there who's ever done this job, ever, who has
accumulated 15 nominations. That's bold, man, nobody's done that," says
Russell, who has been O'Connell's partner through seven of them. "The
most up until this year was 14, by a gentleman who was a wonderful mixer,
the dialogue mixer that Kevin worked with for many years, Donald
Mitchell."</TE>
<TE>   It is lunchtime now, and the two sound guys are loading up on burgers
and steaks in the Sony commissary before heading back to work--to the
dark, loud and unformed universe of "Spider-Man." To yet another busy
show.</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby table, "Spider-Man" director Sam Raimi is lunching
too--with several men in suits. They occupy another world from the
casually dressed O'Connell and Russell, who have about them the
confidence of men who understand their presence isn't wanted on the red
carpet. But they also know that Hollywood cannot function without them,
particularly at a time when as much as 90% of a film's sound content is
built in after shooting ends.</TE>
<TE>   This is something of a credo for them--be indispensable, but don't
advertise it. Tell people you make what a doctor makes. Put on your
tuxedo, and don't leave the house without the speech.</TE>
<TE>   But pre-Oscar jitters still envelop him, year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "I get this feeling that I can't even describe to you, where I have
trouble talking to people," O'Connell said. "I feel choked up, and my
body temperature goes to about 110. Up until the time the award is
announced."</TE>

<HD>President Discusses Trade in Tense Peru</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Talks with Toledo also focus on drugs and peace while
authorities break up protests. Critics at home say U.S. leader is
pandering to Latinos.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>President Bush arrived Saturday in this tense but heavily fortified
capital with his goal of promoting hemispheric trade all but overshadowed
by a feared resurgence of terrorism in Peru and by a political attack at
home from Democrats who accused him of pandering to Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly before he was accorded a red-carpet, 21-gun-salute welcome by
Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, authorities downtown used tear gas
to disperse dozens of anti-American demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   But back in the U.S., there was nothing to prevent Democrats from
using their weekly radio address Saturday to portray Bush's four-day
Latin American trip as a cynical ploy to "curry favor with Latino
voters."</LD>
<TE>   The attack, leveled by former Los Angeles mayoral candidate and
California Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, was unusual because
partisan rhetoric traditionally is held in abeyance while a president is
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is the first incumbent U.S. president to visit Peru. Late in the
afternoon, he and Toledo emerged from their third face-to-face meeting
for a joint news conference that showcased their congeniality.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo observed that although he and Bush are the same age--55--Bush
seems younger. Bush quipped, in a mixture of Spanish and English: "We may
be the same age, but he has black hair."</TE>
<TE>   The two men's bonhomie gave no hint of the extraordinary security
here--required in part because of Bush's 17-hour visit but all the more
so in the wake of a powerful car-bomb blast that killed nine people
Wednesday night near the U.S. Embassy. American officials said the act
had all the earmarks of the Shining Path, the leftist guerrilla group
whose activities have diminished in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Some sections of Lima were closed altogether, while in many other
parts of the city, soldiers and police in riot gear and armored vehicles
were deployed. Snipers could be seen on downtown rooftops as helicopters
hovered overhead and frigates patrolled off the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Among the panoply of bilateral initiatives that Bush touted here was
the reestablishment of the Peace Corps in Peru--27 years after its
presence was ended by an anti-U.S. regime.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the Peace Corps volunteers are expected back in August,
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo has a personal connection to the program: Years ago, Peace
Corps volunteers helped him win a scholarship to study in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said the U.S. Agency for International Development will work
to create centers to improve teacher training not only in Peru but also
in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   When talk turned to fighting drugs, Bush said the U.S. must curtail
its demand for drugs as well as help countries such as Peru wage an
interdiction campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "So we've got a double obligation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president hailed Toledo's democratic and pro-market reforms in
this impoverished nation, where more than 54% of the population of 25.7
million lives in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Bush and Toledo met with the presidents of Bolivia and
Colombia and the vice president of Ecuador to discuss trade and,
specifically, Bush's so-far-unsuccessful efforts to persuade the Senate
to renew the Andean Trade Preference Act.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991 act, which gives the four Andean countries duty-free access
to the U.S. market for a variety of products, expired Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The measure exempting a number of Andean products from U.S. tariffs
was enacted initially as part of a U.S. anti-drug effort designed to help
turn Andean economies away from the production and export of cocaine to
the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   An expanded version of the act passed the House last fall, but a
watered-down one has stalled in the Senate. As a result, duties have been
reimposed on all Andean products.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Bush administration official, the president of one
Latin American country said: "The Senate is manana-ing this to death."
The official would not identify the speaker.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic radio broadcast in the United States, meanwhile,
underscored the struggle between the two major parties for the
increasingly influential Latino vote, especially with control of both
houses of Congress in the balance in the November elections.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa's remarks were the second time in a year that a prominent
Democrat has spoken out against the popular Bush while the president was
traveling. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) accused the
president of isolationism last summer just as Bush was departing for a
trip to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In his address, Villaraigosa argued that it is the Democratic Party,
and not the GOP, that is the true voice of Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's trip this weekend to Latin America is part of an
orchestrated strategy to curry favor with Latino voters," he said,
predicting that many Latinos would agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Our community knows the difference between rhetoric and results,"
Villaraigosa said.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans have little to offer other than platitudes and token
gestures," he contended. "The Republican pursuit of Hispanic votes is a
calculated political strategy. For us, it's an extension of our values."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa ignored or dismissed some recent developments that might
complicate the Democrats' claim to Latino loyalty. For instance, the
GOP-controlled House recently approved a measure that would allow
thousands of migrants who entered the United States illegally or have
overstayed visas to apply for legal residence without returning to their
home countries.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrat-controlled Senate has yet to act--a fact that Bush
was quick to point out Friday in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The president has launched an array of bilateral initiatives with
Mexico--ranging from incentives for business investments to immigration
reforms--that is strongly supported by Mexican President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his own weekly radio address, also focused on his Latin
America trip, which began with a two-day visit to Monterrey, Mexico,
where he announced a new U.S. funding proposal for global assistance at a
U.N. conference on global aid and then met with Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said in his address that his trip was designed to "reaffirm the
central importance I place on American relations with the rest of our
hemisphere"--a priority that he has made clear from the earliest days of
his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to Washington today, Bush is to stop in San Salvador
and meet with the leaders of El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Honduras and Panama.</TE>

<HD>Threats Delay King's Return to Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Homecoming: Italy, which is overseeing the trip, is worried about
security for the exiled monarch on his arrival in Kabul, the capital.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The homecoming of Afghanistan's long-exiled former king, awaited by
many as the potential healer of their fractious and war-weary country,
was postponed Saturday because of fears for his safety.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammad Zaher Shah, 87, who has not seen his country since he was
deposed in a 1973 coup, was due to return Tuesday from exile in Italy.
Margherita Boniver, the Italian official planning to escort him home,
announced that the trip was being delayed by at least a week.</LD>
<LD>   Boniver, the Foreign Ministry undersecretary, said a flurry of
intelligence reports during the last week pointed to threats on Zaher
Shah's life, prompting Italian officials to reexamine security
arrangements. Italy consulted the Bush administration and other Western
governments before the decision, she said.</LD>
<TE>   "We need time for more meticulous planning," Boniver said in a
telephone interview from Rome. "We're trying to take him home to a
country that is still at war.</TE>
<TE>   "There are terrorist elements still at large," she added, declining to
discuss the nature of the reported threats. "Afghanistan is still a
dangerous place."</TE>
<TE>   Armed remnants of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network, enemies of the former king, are fighting in eastern Afghanistan
against U.S.-led forces that ousted the Taliban regime last year. Rumors
of a Taliban plot to mar Zaher Shah's return with violence have long been
circulating here.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, Afghans took two big steps to bury the Taliban legacy,
resuming the ancient celebration of the Nowruz spring holiday and
reopening the school year with girls back in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah's planned homecoming was widely welcomed as part of that
revival and an advance toward peace after 23 years in which the country
careened from Soviet occupation to civil war to fundamentalist rule. The
new United Nations-backed interim government has invited the former
monarch to open a loya jirga, a traditional assembly that will meet in
June to chart a two-year transition to constitutional democracy.</TE>
<TE>   News of Zaher Shah's delay came as a surprise here. Hamid Karzai, the
interim Afghan prime minister, confirmed it just four hours after telling
reporters that the homecoming was still on track. Karzai, a distant
relative and close ally of the deposed king, had planned to fly to Rome
today to accompany him home.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give the Italian government the say, as long as they are
in charge of bringing him home," Karzai told a news conference called to
tout the first day of school. He tried to duck questions about Zaher
Shah, saying, "This is a happy day. Only happy questions, please."</TE>
<TE>   Although most Afghans view Zaher Shah as a respected elder who could
mediate the country's bitter tribal and ethnic rivalries and discourage
power grabs by warlords, his return is not universally welcomed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are drug dealers, warlords, Taliban and Al Qaeda types and what
have you who want to off this guy," said U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Huntington Beach), a longtime political supporter of Zaher Shah who
has planned to visit him here.</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials had assumed responsibility for Zaher Shah on the
planned Italian air force flight from Rome. But they began to worry late
last week about confusion over who would protect him after his landing in
Kabul, the Afghan capital, where a huge welcoming crowd was expected.</TE>
<TE>   "The Italians are thinking: After they get him back to Kabul, then
what?" said a diplomat from another Western country.</TE>
<TE>   The interim Afghan government's army and police are controlled by
ethnic Tajik militia leaders long opposed to the former king, who is,
like Karzai, an ethnic Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last Sunday, Zaher Shah said he would be guarded here
by "three circles" of defenders--his own trusted bodyguards up close,
then the interim government's security forces and, finally, an outer ring
made up of units of the capital's British-led international peacekeeping
force.</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials said last week that their nation's peacekeeping
units wanted to protect the ex-king during the ride from the airport to
his new home, which is in a walled compound.</TE>
<TE>   But Karzai said Saturday that Afghans would be in charge of protecting
Zaher Shah after he landed, and a British commander said international
peacekeepers would not be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials said they wanted a review of the international
peacekeepers' rules of engagement to determine whether they could play
such a role. The question of who is in charge of security "has to be
discussed in more depth," Boniver said.</TE>
<TE>   The former king reacted to the delay with the "disappointment of a man
dying to go home to his country" but accepted it, she said. "He's
grateful that we're trying to take such good care of him."</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to get back earlier, but we're not going to make a fuss,"
the ex-king's spokesman, Hamid Sidig, said from Rome. "This may be good
for us. Everything about this homecoming should be perfect."</TE>

<HD>British Manor's Centuries of Wear Leave Its Lord a Hefty Repair
Bill</HD>
<DH>Europe: Longleat House has seen better days, but a $20-million art
auction may turn things around for the home of the 7th Marquess of Bath.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARMINSTER, England
</DL>
<LD>The trouble with an Elizabethan mansion that has been in the family
for nearly 450 years is that it can start to look a little
down-at-the-mouth without proper upkeep. But then you do a little
stonework on the north wing here, some reupholstery in a state dining
room there, and suddenly the 100-room house is eating up a noble purse.</LD>
<LD>   It's a real dilemma.</LD>
<LD>   "Something's always cropping up that needs repair," lamented Alexander
Thynn, a.k.a. the 7th Marquess of Bath.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, Lord Bath had a few surplus heirlooms lying about the
place: some Dutch Old Master paintings and 15th century manuscripts
inherited from a minor branch of the family. He has decided to sell the
art and antiques at a Christie's auction in June that is expected to
yield $20 million to $30 million for the preservation of his stately
Longleat House here in Wiltshire.</TE>
<TE>   "There were rather too many things to get all of them on exhibit, and
it was decided it was better to get that value working for the house,"
Thynn said.</TE>
<TE>   This sounds a sensible solution from an aristocrat who is generally
described as anything but sensible. More often, the 69-year-old is called
an eccentric, a hedonist or, as a patron of the Bath Arms pub said, "an
amiable nutter." He is best known for keeping a series of more than 70
mistresses, whom he calls "wifelets," and for covering the walls of
Longleat's private quarters with floor-to-ceiling murals that his
brother, Christopher, once described as looking like "pornographic
pizza."</TE>
<TE>   Thynn has agreed to an interview and tour of his residence ahead of
the auction, and his visitors find him reclining on a daybed with a
left-of-center daily newspaper. He rises quickly on bare feet, wearing
violet velvet pants, a floral vest and a rumpled Guatemalan jacket. With
long gray curls and a gold hoop earring, the nobleman looks part pirate,
part Ken Kesey.</TE>
<TE>   He fancies himself an artiste, although he laughingly acknowledges
that he never quite made a name for himself as one. Thynn has dedicated
his life to writing his autobiography and to painting portraits of
himself, his lovers and royal ancestors, all of whom end up looking
remarkably alike on canvases thick with oil paint.</TE>
<TE>   His unfinished autobiography is a chronicle of a life spent
chronicling a life. Already six volumes, it is titled "Strictly Private"
and is available on the Internet on his Web site,
http://www.lordbath.co.uk.</TE>
<TE>   Thynn moves from a drawing room covered in murals of "the ages of
man"--conception, innocence, adolescence, maturity and decay--to another
series of murals he calls his "formative footprints." The style is a kind
of gloppy, indigestible Chagall, and they are sandwiched between
self-portraits.</TE>
<TE>   "So, what room is this?" a visitor asked politely. It seemed safer
than commenting on the art, but Thynn looked confused before replying
that the expanse was no room at all. "It is the southwest corridor."</TE>
<TE>   "So that's the library, then?" the visitor said in a book-lined room.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the study. There are a number of libraries around with
different names."</TE>
<TE>   Thynn describes the next murals of various pimps and predators as
"facets of my own identity."</TE>
<TE>   "Here I allowed my paranoia to run riot with things that go bump in
the night," he said. Then, with a nod to genteel 1930s portraits of his
father and mother, Henry Frederick Thynne and Daphne Vivian, he added,
"And at the center of it all is one's greatest paranoia, one's parents."</TE>
<TE>   He means this as a joke, but his paintings reveal the pain provoked by
a father who admired the Nazis and a mother who failed to appreciate her
son's art. Neighbors and newspaper clips tell the rest--a feud and bitter
break with his brother Christopher, and a deep sadness for the youngest
brother, Valentine, who hanged himself over the Bath Arms bar.</TE>
<TE>   Thynn moves on to a spiral staircase bedecked with portraits of his
mistresses. "I call this Bluebeard's collection. The heads go nearly all
the way up, but I fear I'll die before I get to the top. It's upsetting
to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the billiard room, the four-room nursery, more
corridors, dining rooms, rooms of familial kings and queens and
genealogical charts, an erotic bedroom complete with rhino horns and
orgiastic murals, and a penthouse suite in 21st century decor. It is a
far cry from the tasteful treasures on display in the public rooms of
Longleat, and from the 400 antiques to be sold at Christie's to pay
repair bills.</TE>
<TE>   Longleat was built in 1568 and became the first stately home thrown
open to the public in 1949 when Thynn's father needed $1.5 million to pay
taxes. Dad soon added a safari park and other attractions that drew about
400,000 visitors a year until foot-and-mouth disease shut down much of
the British countryside last year. Longleat's income fell dramatically,
driving home the need for a more stable source of money.</TE>
<TE>   Thynn grew up in another house on the 9,000-acre estate and spent
holidays in what was then his grandfather's mansion. He lived in the
style to which the family was accustomed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were brought up to regard ourselves as superior sort of people,
without it ever getting spelled out precisely what that superiority
entailed," Thynn wrote in his autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some vague idea about us all having class, as if it must be
something perceptible, like the color of our blood literally being blue.
But we were made aware how this was a delicate subject that we couldn't
discuss with others . . . because they didn't have class, so they
wouldn't understand what we were talking about, and might even be
offended if they tried," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "The importance of who I was, and of what I was going to become, was
never too far from my mind. When I was 7, a couple of our footmen put
that very question to me: perhaps for the reason that they knew damn well
I wasn't going to reply that I wanted to be an engine-driver, a soldier,
or even a prime minister. I informed them, as indeed I had been told,
that I was going to be the Marquess of Bath," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Thynn went to Eton and Oxford, served with the Life Guards Regiment
and studied art in Paris. He moved into Longleat in 1953, became a hippie
in the 1960s and married a Hungarian actress, Anna Gael, who spends most
of her time in Paris. They have two children, and Thynn has a third child
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He inherited Longleat from his father when the 6th Marquess of Bath
died in 1992 and, according to press reports and locals at the pub, puts
up several of his present and former mistresses in cottages on the
estate.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at the chiropractor's recently when one of the wifelets came
out and said to the assistant, 'Put this on Lord Bath's bill. Account No.
2,' " one of the pub patrons said. "No wonder he's skint."</TE>
<TE>   Broke he clearly is not, but Thynn is careful. He switches off the
lights as he leaves each room and says he lives a relatively modest
life--relative to other aristocrats anyway.</TE>
<TE>   He says he is sad to sell off some of the extra family treasures--the
core collection cannot be sold under terms of a trusteeship--but is
resigned that the trustees are doing the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the correct thing to do, to use the accumulated wealth to
preserve the property," Thynn said.</TE>

<HD>TV Tape of Army Raid Stuns Israelis</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Broadcast showing mortally wounded Palestinian woman
sparks debate over military tactics and media access to troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AIDA REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The death of Huda Hawajah, mother of five, might have been chalked
up as one more tragedy, another Palestinian civilian killed by Israeli
troops during a military raid.</LD>
<LD>   Except that Hawajah's death made the evening news. The Israeli evening
news.</LD>
<LD>   And with that came a wrenching debate over the tactics employed by an
army that the majority of Israelis regard as a respectable institution
with high moral standards. The footage broadcast by commercial Channel
Two television forced Israelis to examine their army's behavior in the
aftermath of its largest ground offensive in two decades. And it also set
off a firestorm of debate over media access to the war.</LD>
<TE>   Israel's raids into Palestinian refugee camps and cities earned
considerable reproach overseas, among human rights organizations and at
the United Nations. The sight of hundreds of men--blindfolded, handcuffed
and marked with numbers--shocked people here and abroad. But the short
videotape of the raid into the Aida refuge camp brought the troubling
issue home to many Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Some believed that scenes of Hawajah's children watching her bleed to
death as Israeli soldiers stormed her home should not have been
broadcast. Too demoralizing at a time of war, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Others said it was important to confront what the army was doing in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for better or for worse.</TE>
<TE>   Channel Two defied the army's public affairs office, which ordered
that the tape not be broadcast. The footage was taken by an Israeli
cameraman who was allowed to accompany the troops, and several scenes
were included in a current affairs program March 15. Last week, the
defense minister ordered the army to "think twice" before again allowing
reporters to accompany soldiers in action.</TE>
<TE>Footage of Searches</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Hawajah ordeal in the Aida camp, near the biblical
city of Bethlehem, the footage showed Israeli soldiers rummaging through
the bedrooms and kitchens of other Palestinian refugee families. The
searches were part of a massive military operation in which thousands of
troops raided refugee camps and Palestinian cities throughout the West
Bank and Gaza with the stated goal of rounding up militants and
confiscating weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In a scene that caused considerable uproar, one 20-year-old soldier
was interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we are doing here," he told the camera. "
'Cleansing.' It must be dirty here. I don't know what a Hebrew boy is
doing far away from the homeland."</TE>
<TE>   Channel Two said it decided to air the footage to trigger a public
debate "on the meaning and consequences of the way we as a country and
society defend ourselves." The reporter who narrated the sequence, Ruthi
Shiloni, and the station were flooded with both complaints and praise in
the hours after the show aired.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult for us to acknowledge that we are doing this kind of
thing," said Matti Golan, a writer who hosts a radio and television talk
show called "Documedia." "My son is in the army, in a combat unit, and I
don't want to think he participates in this kind of thing. But if he gets
an order, that is what he will do. But I don't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Golan's program carried a lively debate on the controversial footage
and on whether media access to army missions should be restricted. Some
participants said that Israel has nothing to hide and should be confident
enough in its actions to show the bad with the good. Others said a united
front in what Israel describes as its war on terrorism is more important.</TE>
<TE>   Gideon Meir, an official with the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, also
took to the airwaves to defend Channel Two's decision to broadcast the
images. But he said he understood the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Israelis and Jews around the world believe the army does not
behave this way, and if there is an exception, they want it to be kept
within the family," he said. "We have nothing to hide. If there are
exceptions, they have to be treated by the [army]."</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the army's chief spokesman, said he was
chagrined by the broadcast--angry at Channel Two for presenting what he
said was a distorted and exaggerated report, and angrier at the soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am ashamed at the way the soldiers acted," Kitrey said. He said
cameras were invited to show the professionalism of the army and its
soldiers and instead they got what he branded the actions of a minority.</TE>
<TE>   The program opened with soldiers saying morning prayers and then a
commander instructing his men to first try to gain entry to a refugee
home by knocking on the front door. If that failed, he said, they should
take a sledgehammer to it, and in "problematic" cases, use an explosive.</TE>
<TE>   The next scene showed Hawajah's front door, which had been blown from
its hinges and crumpled by the force of an explosion. Viewers did not see
Huda Hawajah being mortally wounded, but according to her husband,
Ismail, pieces of metal were propelled from the blast and into her body
as she stood in the hallway, on the way to the kitchen to prepare lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers did see Ismail pleading for help in getting an ambulance past
Israeli military roadblocks, and they heard a soldier, probably the
medic, saying he was reluctant to lift the woman on a stretcher because
she might lose consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawajahs' 9-year-old daughter was then seen weeping, and the
reporter explained that she was watching her mother on the floor. The
woman was later seen being taken away by Red Crescent medical personnel.
Then an 11-year-old daughter, Sumud, pleaded with the soldiers not to
tear a hole in the wall, as they did frequently during the operation to
create passages between refugee homes. "Please, please," she said in
English. They drilled a gaping hole anyway.</TE>
<TE>Ambulance Faces Delays</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week at his home, Ismail Hawajah said he noticed
the television camera as the troops came into his living and dining rooms
and ordered his family into a single area. He asked the cameraman if he
spoke Arabic, hoping the man could serve as a translator. But the
cameraman said he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Hawajah, 36, said he had expected the soldiers to arrive at his
doorstep the morning of March 8 because he could hear them drilling
through the walls of other houses in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I saw them through the [door's] window, and I was waiting for
them to knock. I would have opened the door," he said. "All of a sudden,
I heard the explosion."</TE>
<TE>   His wife lay bleeding profusely on the carpeted floor. He frantically
removed her veil and tried to use it as a tourniquet. Then about 30
soldiers entered and ordered him to stand back. The medic helped attend
to Huda Hawajah, but it took nearly an hour for a Palestinian ambulance
to get around various roadblocks and tanks and reach the stricken woman.
She was pronounced dead when the ambulance at last reached a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail said he explained to their five children that their mother was
dead and had gone to be with God. The two youngest, 3 and 4, don't
understand and still expect her to come home from the hospital, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Huda was a math teacher. Ismail works at an Islamic orphanage in East
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over army tactics comes amid a general acknowledgment that
the massive military operation of the first two weeks of March did little
to stop terrorism. The raids--Israel's largest military campaign in the
West Bank and Gaza since it conquered those territories in the 1967
Middle East War--also brought rare criticism from Washington and stinging
rebukes from human rights organizations.</TE>

<HD>Latin America Is Testing the Mettle of the Media</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Reporters are increasingly targeted by attacks and
lawsuits in a region where free speech is not fully protected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>When President Hugo Chavez finally held a news conference last
month, his first since fall, journalist Laura Weffer asked a simple--and,
for her, very personal--question.</LD>
<LD>   The Venezuelan leader had given an angry speech in December telling
his supporters that the media were against them. Did he feel responsible
for the wave of violence that followed--the mobs that had beaten
reporters, the bombing of a newspaper office?</LD>
<LD>   Instead of answering, Chavez challenged the young reporter: Which
journalists were attacked? Weffer, punched in the face by a Chavez
supporter, placed a hand against her chest. Who else, he demanded to
know. A reporter stood up. Then another. Then another.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez simply sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "My dear girl," Chavez said, "I am not going to continue with this,
like a broken record. I have no answer to your question."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange was not unique to Venezuela. Throughout Latin America,
journalists are asking pointed questions as they come under fire in a
manner not seen since most of the region's repressive dictatorships ended
a decade or more ago.</TE>
<TE>   Groups that document such threats have registered growing numbers of
lawsuits, beatings and slayings compared with the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven journalists were killed in Latin America last year, according
to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, compared with
seven in 2000 and six in 1999. Last year, for the first time in more than
a decade, journalists in Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay were killed in
connection with their work.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia, in the midst of a vicious internal conflict, continues to be
one of the deadliest countries in the world for reporters. Three
journalists were killed last year in connection with their work; five
more were slain for unknown reasons. Two have been killed so far this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits threatening to silence reporters also have increased. A
decade after Latin American nations had enacted other democratic reforms,
such as more open economies, not one country in the region fully protects
freedom of expression, according to a recent survey by the Inter-American
Press Assn.</TE>
<TE>   One of the problems is that legal systems still give special
protection to public officials, allowing them to sue over stories
insulting their "honor." About 15 Latin American countries have such
laws, allowing legislators and presidents to intimidate and silence
criticism through legal means. In Panama, more than 70 such lawsuits are
pending against reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become so bad that the Organization of American States
at its annual summit in 1998 created a high-level post to deal with
reports of threats against the media.</TE>
<TE>   Most alarming, perhaps, is that many court actions have come from
democratically elected officials. Panama's president sued a newspaper for
running a ribald political cartoon. Guatemala's government, which has
been at war with the media for their corruption exposes, approved new
licensing requirements affecting journalists. The country's Supreme Court
recently suspended the measures.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, a populist leader facing an increasingly unstable political
situation in Venezuela, has launched an all-out verbal blitz, accusing
journalists of blocking his leftist reforms and betraying the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists "cannot say they are innocent. No, here there are no
innocents; everyone must assume their responsibility before history and
the people," Chavez said during a December address in which he excoriated
the media. "People are tired of the lies, of the manipulation, of the
deception. . . . 2002 will be the year of the offensive."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks against journalists are significant beyond the threat they
represent to free and open speech. They are an early indicator of a
crisis facing democracy in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>Social Problems Persist</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade after every country in the Western Hemisphere but Cuba
embraced free elections and free-market reforms, most nations still find
themselves mired in poverty, joblessness and severe social problems.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America and the Caribbean have the most skewed distributions of
income among regions in the world, according to a recent United Nations
report. In Brazil, for instance, the richest 10% account for nearly half
the country's income, while the poorest 10% account for about 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy's failure to deliver a better life to Latin America's
impoverished millions has endangered its future in the region. The
attacks against media are simply an example of a greater frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "With global recession and weakening democratic institutions
throughout the region, what we are seeing is a surge in systematic
attacks on the press and human rights groups," said Bruce Bagley, a Latin
America expert at the University of Miami.</TE>
<TE>   A big part of the problem in Latin America is the increasing distance
between major political parties and the people they are supposed to
represent. There is a widespread perception of corruption and
ineffectiveness. As the parties have become less relevant, allowing
victories by populists such as Chavez or former dictators such as Efrain
Rios Montt, now head of Guatemala's Congress, the media have stepped into
the breach, becoming an often aggressive voice of opposition.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, has placed the media in conflict with those in power.</TE>
<TE>   When the influential Costa Rican daily La Nacion published a story in
1995 about an honorary diplomat who had allegedly abused his powers
abroad, the diplomat sued the newspaper and won a $100,000 judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, the paper won a decision from the regional
Inter-American Court of Human Rights suspending the judgment in order to
determine the legality of the country's "honor" codes, which make
slandering a public official a criminal offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Undoubtedly, the judgment has menaced us," said the paper's editor in
chief, Eduardo Ulibarri. "It has produced not fear but caution."</TE>
<TE>   A final reason behind the increase in attacks against journalists
shows another worrisome trend in Latin America: Even as economic and
governmental reforms have advanced, the region's centuries-old legal
system rarely produces results. Most crimes go unsolved, and most arrests
do not end in convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the problem of a government assault against the media
clearer than in Venezuela, where Chavez has seen his support drop
precipitously in recent months in the wake of unpopular reforms and
rhetorical battles with major institutions such as the church, industry,
unions and the media.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters by the hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to
oppose the recently enacted reforms, including one that allows the
government to force the sale of land for redistribution to the poor.</TE>
<TE>Venezuela's Media War</TE>
<TE>   The protests have been supported, indeed promoted, by the country's
bare-knuckle media, which have contemptuously opposed Chavez's efforts.
One recent front-page editorial referred to the president only by his
first name and in a familiar form of address used with children or
between friends.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has responded by becoming increasingly personal in his
broadsides. In nationwide broadcasts that the government requires all
radio and television networks to carry, he has singled out journalists by
name as liars, oligarchs and worse.</TE>
<TE>   Most worrisome have been Chavez's recent exhortations to followers. He
has indirectly encouraged assaults against the media.</TE>
<TE>   The government "is not going to restrict freedom of the press," Chavez
said in a televised address last September. "This issue with the media is
something for the people--this issue, and this problem, is not for Chavez
alone."</TE>
<TE>   The verbal attacks took on physical form in early January when several
reporters, along with opposition politicians, were punched or hit by
rocks thrown by Chavez supporters outside the National Assembly during a
demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, a crowd of about 150 people--many of them identified
later as municipal employees for a borough of Caracas, the capital,
controlled by a Chavez ally--surrounded the offices of El Nacional, one
of the country's leading newspapers. Police dispersed the mob with tear
gas and water hoses.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the end of January, a bomb blew out the windows in front of
the reception desk of Asi Es La Noticia, a tabloid owned by El Nacional.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that week, the tabloid's director, Ibeyise Pacheco, and three
other journalists had released a videotape that showed Venezuelan
military officers meeting with leftist Colombian rebels to negotiate the
release of a kidnapped Venezuelan.</TE>
<TE>   The tape reignited controversy over whether Chavez has links with the
rebels, though he insisted that the contacts were purely a humanitarian
effort to aid the hostage. Pacheco believes that Chavez supporters were
behind the attacks, though she has no proof.</TE>
<TE>   In her small office packed with televisions and newspapers, Pacheco
seemed undaunted during a recent interview. She promised to reveal more
ties between Chavez and Colombian rebels in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not cease to do this," she said. "We will continue."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez and his allies insist that the media are more free than in the
distant past, when journalists were thrown in jail for their coverage.
And no reporter interviewed could cite a case in which a story had been
censored or suppressed in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "There is total freedom of the press here," said Willian Lara, the
head of the country's unicameral National Assembly and a former
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   But many journalists said coverage already has changed. Miguel Otero,
publisher of El Nacional, said the constant criticism has forced the
paper into an unwelcome role: that of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, he waved toward a darkened window in a bleak dun
apartment building across from his office. From there intelligence agents
were videotaping his every move, he said, citing military sources.</TE>
<TE>   Objectivity "is a problem now. Unavoidably there's a bias," Otero
said. "The media are the opposition. The church is the opposition. The
industries are the opposition. The union is the opposition. He has taken
all of us out of our traditional roles."</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to inform," Otero said. "We do not want to be
protagonists."</TE>

<HD>4 Palestinians, 1 Israeli Slain as Arafat Plans for Summit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY
</DL>
<LD>Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians who attacked an
army post with grenades Saturday, as aides to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat said he would go to an Arab summit in Beirut
after three months of confinement by Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The militant Islamic group Hamas said the two men belonged to its
armed wing. The army said the men attacked an outpost near the Jewish
settlement of Dugit in the northern Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   A Palestinian teacher, Subhu abu Manus, was killed when Israeli tanks
shelled the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, Palestinian security sources
and hospital officials said. The army denied it fired a tank shell in the
area.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian sources said another Palestinian was killed by soldiers at
a junction near a Jewish settlement in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Their deaths preceded the emotional funeral of a 4-year-old girl,
Reham abu Taha, shot in the head Thursday outside her home in Rafah.
Crowds chanted, "Why was she killed?" as they carried her corpse, adorned
with flowers, through Rafah's dusty streets.</TE>
<TE>   Then today, an Israeli woman was killed when suspected Palestinian
militants opened fired on a car near the West Bank settlement of Ateret,
north of the city of Ramallah, the Israeli army said.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodshed, in the wake of three Palestinian suicide bombings since
Wednesday, tore at hopes that U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni would succeed
in brokering a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Talks on a cease-fire ended inconclusively Friday, and another session
was scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, had restricted the
globe-trotting Arafat to his offices in Ramallah because of repeated
Palestinian shootings and suicide bombings. Sharon has demanded that
Arafat crack down on Palestinian militants targeting Israeli civilians in
18 months of bloodshed, which has killed about 1,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials want Arafat to attend the Arab summit to help give
momentum to a Saudi plan for Middle East peace to be addressed there.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli security source said that Sharon had proposed, in talks
with Vice President Dick Cheney last week, that he go to Beirut to
present Israeli views on the Saudi plan.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon is unlikely to be welcome in Beirut, where he is reviled
for masterminding Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The plan by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah proposes that, in exchange for
full normalization of Arab ties, Israel withdraw from land taken in the
1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a report published today said Israeli and U.S. intelligence
sources believe that Arafat has forged an alliance involved in Iranian
shipments of weapons and money to Palestinian groups. The New York Times
said the partnership was arranged in a clandestine Moscow meeting between
Arafat aides and Iranian officials in May.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials were troubled by intelligence reports "that Iran is
harboring Al Qaeda members, including one leader who recently tried to
mount an attack against Israel from his sanctuary in Iran," the newspaper
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority officials dismissed the accusations of Iranian
involvement.</TE>

<HD>Native Names Don't Sound Sweet to Some S. Africans</HD>
<DH>Politics: Movement to re-christen places to remove words associated
with white dominance raises a furor among Afrikaners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Efforts to "Africanize" the names of this country's provinces,
towns and streets have stirred controversy among blacks seeking to break
with a past marked by white domination and Afrikaners insisting that the
moves amount to "ethnic cleansing."</LD>
<LD>   The latest flare-up came last month, when legislators voted to change
the Northern Province's name to Limpopo, the most popular suggestion from
a short list submitted by the public. Several key towns and streets in
the province have also been targeted for renaming.</LD>
<LD>   Ngoako Ramathlodi, premier of Northern Province, said the changes are
necessary to restore confidence among blacks and to help erase some of
the brutal memories of African subjugation and colonial rule.</LD>
<TE>   "Our sense of self-esteem suffered a massive blow," Ramathlodi said.
"Part of the task of the liberation struggle is to regain the humanity of
the Africans, including their right to call themselves by their own
names. What we seek and hope to achieve, is to elevate the status of the
African to that of their fellow compatriots."</TE>
<TE>   But Afrikaner community leaders in the Northern Province said the move
is "a kick in the face" that discriminates against white cultural
interests. They are planning a civil disobedience campaign that could
include withholding municipal property taxes and setting up alternative
city councils in the province. Taxpayers' money, they say, should not be
used to fund the renaming project, which is expected to cost about 40
million rand, or about $3.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Afrikaners, earlier called Boers, are descendants of mainly Dutch
immigrants who settled in South Africa in the 17th century. Many of the
towns chosen for renaming had been named after Afrikaner generals, heroes
and pioneers, as well as some of the architects of the country's racist
apartheid regime.</TE>
<TE>   White rule ended in South Africa in 1994. Some fear that the
name-changing exercise could undermine efforts to enhance national
reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term, it could cause certain groups to feel under
attack, to feel disgruntled, to feel that the new order is there to wipe
out their historical backgrounds," said Thabo Rapoo, a senior researcher
at the Center for Policy Studies, a Johannesburg think tank. "But in the
long term, the names will probably start developing and growing on
people, and they will adopt them."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the name changes also argue that the Afrikaners
disregarded the traditional names of many areas when they dispossessed
blacks of their land. The Boers also hurried to change names when they
came to power in 1948 in order to remove the stigma of the previous
British colonial era.</TE>
<TE>   Limpopo is the name of the second-largest African river entering the
Indian Ocean; although there is some dispute over the origin of the word,
it is widely believed to come from an ethnic Ndebele or Sotho word
meaning "river of the waterfall."</TE>
<TE>   The provincial capital Pietersburg, named for Afrikaner general Piet
Joubert, is to be known as Polokwane, meaning "place of safety" in the
indigenous North Sotho language. The northern town of Louis Trichardt,
honoring the first "Voortrekker," or pioneer, has also been targeted for
an African name.</TE>
<TE>   Voortrekkers were Afrikaners who left the country's Western Cape
region in the 1830s to escape British rule and the emancipation of
slaves. Their harrowing Great Trek into the country's interior is the
stuff of Afrikaner legend, so stripping their names from the nation's
maps is seen as a serious affront.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply offended and will not take this lying down," Johan
Willemse, provincial head of the Afrikaner Freedom Front, said after the
name changes were announced. Northern Province is the third province to
change its name, a process that requires the approval of the national
Parliament. Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, or PWV, the province
where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located, was changed to Gauteng in
1995. Eastern Transvaal became Mpumalanga the same year. Eastern Cape
province has also indicated its intention to follow suit, and leaders are
keen to find a name that reflects the progress the country has made under
black majority rule.</TE>
<TE>   Many roads and bridges across the country still carry names such as
Daniel F. Malan, the first prime minister under apartheid, and Hendrik F.
Verwoerd, another prime minister who instituted many of the most petty
and repressive regulations against nonwhites.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got to overturn this history and traverse a new course of
historical orientation," Joe Maswanganyi, Northern Province's chief
executive councilor, recently said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramathlodi, the provincial premier, rejected claims that the cost of
changing names would be prohibitive. He said a phased approach would be
adopted to allow time to alter road signs, maps, notice boards and
stationery.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who argue that we have no right to use our own name because it
is too expensive to do so, or it is an insult to their history, are
missing the point," Ramathlodi told the provincial legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has galvanized public debate, with South Africans across the
board eagerly airing their views on public radio and in local newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have sympathy with the desire of a community to change the names of
towns and streets that are dear to them. An indigenous name for Northern
Province is long overdue," wrote one reader, D.F. Van Tonder, in a letter
to the editor of the Daily Citizen newspaper. "But please do not
antagonize other countrymen in the process. Must I hide my head in shame
every time the name 'Voortrekker' is mentioned?"</TE>
<TE>   Many blacks, however, retort that the colonial names are a painful
reminder of a history of oppressive practices, which runs contrary to the
current political dispensation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is sickening that almost eight years into black rule, entry into
towns in our country is still characterized by statues of invaders on
horseback, signifying the victory that is no more," Mathatha Tsedu, a
newspaper columnist and chairman of the South African National Editors'
Forum, recently wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Afrikaner leaders accuse provincial politicians of using the renaming
issue to whip up emotional support and deflect attention from other
pressing issues that they have failed to tackle, such as unemployment,
combating crime and developing the infrastructure. They warned that the
move could backfire by heightening social tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Other political parties have come out in support of the disgruntled
Afrikaners.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there is a lot of racism attached to [the name changes]
because all the Afrikaans names, even neutral names, like Naboomspruit
and Nylstroom, have changed just because the old regime gave those
names," Willie Snyman, deputy leader of the Conservative Party, told a
local newspaper recently. "There's a lot of hard feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The largely Afrikaner New National Party called on the provincial
government to rethink its decision. And the multicultural United
Democratic Front and the predominately black African Christian Democratic
Party have argued that the renaming project is an unnecessary waste of
resources in a province that is strapped for cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes are tantamount to dancing on the graves of our
ancestors," Willemse, the Freedom Front provincial leader, told reporters
recently. "The Afrikaners who established civilized norms in this country
over the past 3 1/2 centuries are kicked in the face."</TE>

<HD>Kosovo Serbs Fear Day They'll Have to Walk Alone</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Unescorted villagers are sometimes attacked by ethnic
Albanians. The U.N. force protecting them won't be around forever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GNJILANE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Radunka Antonijevic, a Serb, lives with her two children in an
ethnic Albanian neighborhood of this southeastern Kosovo town. Her
apartment is ringed by barbed wire and guarded by peacekeepers 24 hours a
day.</LD>
<LD>   The few Serbian children living in the building used to have a United
Nations police escort to school, but that ended last month, to
Antonijevic's great dismay. "They told us, 'Now everything is secure. You
have conditions to walk freely. . . . We can't escort you forever,' " she
said.</LD>
<LD>   She and other parents now guard the children on the 10-minute walk to
class. "The old residents know us, and they never harass us," she said.
"But the young teenagers call us 'pigs.' . . . A few times they threw
stones at the children."</LD>
<TE>   Although Kosovo is still torn by ethnic hatred, international police
and peacekeepers see some progress toward normality--and no choice but to
begin thinking seriously about what happens when they leave.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be here much longer," predicted Derek Chappell,
spokesman for Kosovo's U.N. police, noting that the Bush administration
is focused on places such as Afghanistan and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is pushing for greater attention to Africa's problems.</TE>
<TE>   That means the effort to make Kosovo safe and stable even without
international policing must be put "on fast forward," Chappell said. "At
some point, the people here have to live together. Protecting people from
that reality every day by giving them an armed escort to go and buy their
bread and milk doesn't help with any resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Chappell said he sees "small signs of reconciliation," noting that
it's now sometimes possible to see a car with Serbian license plates in
Kosovo's predominantly ethnic Albanian capital, Pristina. "A year and a
half ago that would never have happened," he said. "They'd have been
attacked."</TE>
<TE>   Most ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90% of Kosovo's
population, still view local Serbs as unrepentant former oppressors.
Hatred is especially intense among rural people who fled for weeks at a
time into the mountains in 1998 and 1999 when Serbian forces fighting a
separatist guerrilla insurgency attacked their villages and destroyed
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Many ethnic Albanians say Serbs could do much to ease tensions by
publicly rejecting former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic--now on
trial at The Hague for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity--and
by apologizing for the crimes his forces committed in the people's name.
Thousands of ethnic Albanians were slain and hundreds of thousands driven
from their homes before NATO forces stepped in, forcing Milosevic to
withdraw from the province in 1999 and accept a U.N. administration.</TE>
<TE>   But many Serbs in Kosovo still view Milosevic as a hero and say that
neither he nor they did anything wrong. Few see the need for an apology,
nor do they make any connection between their support for the former
Yugoslav leader and their current life in a virtual state of siege.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic made some mistakes, but "he was defending his people here
against terrorists, just as [President] Bush is defending his people in
America now," said Sinisa Petrovic, 37, a Serb who lives in the village
of Gracanica. "The army was shooting at houses and demolishing
houses--but houses they saw shots coming from."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. administration in Kosovo has preached the need for a
multiethnic society. But in practice, the best that international police
and the NATO-led peacekeepers--known as Kosovo Force, or KFOR--have been
able to achieve is some measure of protection for Serbs isolated in
enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Albanians also feel unsafe in Serbian areas, but that does
little to restrict their freedom of movement.</TE>
<TE>   The new head of the United Nations mission here, Michael Steiner,
stressed last month at his first news conference that providing better
security and the rule of law for all is one of his top priorities. "I
think it is vital that there be a safe home for all Kosovo residents," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   KFOR still provides protection for 65 convoys a week from one place to
another within Kosovo or between Kosovo and other areas of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's main republic, said Daz Slaven, spokesman for the force. In
addition, it carries out nearly 100 smaller escort operations a week.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to blur the geographical divisions between ethnic groups,
some of the fortified posts where peacekeepers stand guard to protect
Serbian enclaves are being dismantled, with the soldiers sent instead on
random patrols, Chappell said. A fixed post can "almost create the sense
that 'if I go beyond this point, I'm going to get killed,' " he
explained.</TE>
<TE>   That is pretty much the belief of Petrovic, who thinks that he would
be taking an enormous risk to venture into dusty but bustling Pristina,
just five miles from his home.</TE>
<TE>   "They would kidnap me, which is much worse than being killed,"
Petrovic explained. "If we were talking just about Albanians born and
raised in Pristina, I wouldn't be afraid. But there are a lot of people
there now from villages who are not civilized people. I'm afraid of
them."</TE>
<TE>Only Trip Was to Visit Sick Father</TE>
<TE>   Petrovic said he has left Gracanica only once since mid-1999, when
Yugoslav and Serbian forces were replaced by peacekeepers and the U.N.
mission. That was to take an escorted trip last year to see his sick
father elsewhere in Serbia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo came under U.N. administration after a 78-day North Atlantic
Treaty Organization bombing campaign aimed at forcing Milosevic to end
his repression of its separatist-minded ethnic Albanian majority.
Although it technically remains a province of Serbia, virtually all
ethnic Albanians hope and expect that Kosovo will become independent,
something vehemently opposed by almost all Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before and after the peacekeeping force entered Kosovo, nearly
200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians left the province, many in fear of
reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians. About 80,000 Serbs remain among
Kosovo's more than 2 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Serbs living in the northern part of the province at least have free
access to the main part of Serbia, which abuts that enclave. They also
have hopes that if Kosovo becomes independent, only the areas dominated
by ethnic Albanians will break away.</TE>
<TE>   But an estimated 30,000 Serbs live in scattered enclaves surrounded by
ethnic Albanian communities, where they feel trapped.</TE>
<TE>   Petrovic noted that even the bus convoy he took to see his father,
which operates once a week, is not particularly safe, though it is
routinely escorted by KFOR soldiers and armored personnel carriers.
People along the way often throw stones at the buses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The worst incident on that route--and the one most responsible for
making Serbs feel trapped--was the death of 11 people in an attack Feb.
16, 2001, on escorted buses. The attackers had placed a bomb in a
culvert, kept watch from about a mile away, then detonated the device by
wire.</TE>
<TE>   A primary suspect, Florim Ejupi, an ethnic Albanian, was linked to the
scene based on DNA from a cigarette butt. He was arrested and held at
Camp Bondsteel, the U.S. military base in Kosovo, but escaped last May in
an incident U.S. officials blamed on human error.</TE>
<TE>   The case against three other ethnic Albanian suspects arrested in the
bombing hinged in part on proving Ejupi's role, Chappell said. There also
were practical problems in using intelligence information against those
suspects in court, he said. U.N. authorities are working under a Yugoslav
criminal code that does not allow evidence obtained from electronic
surveillance to be used. As a result, a panel of judges freed the three
suspects in December for lack of evidence, Chappell said.</TE>
<TE>   For many Serbs, the case reflects an inability or unwillingness of
international authorities to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tragedy for Kosovo that we never had that trial,
because it would have been a watershed in establishing the rule of law,"
Chappell said.</TE>
<TE>Many Have Their Own Horror Stories</TE>
<TE>   The bus attack and the still-unsolved slayings of 14 Serbian farmers
in a field south of Pristina in July 1999 are the two most dramatic
incidents that have terrified Serbs. But many have personal horror
stories to tell.</TE>
<TE>   Goran Stojanovic, 24, who works at a coffee shop in the village of
Silovo, said he was nearly killed last year while trying to walk into
nearby Gnjilane with several neighbors. Several ethnic Albanian men
waylaid them.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a gun pointed at me," he said. "We were threatened, and some
were beaten."</TE>
<TE>   Stojanovic said he has left his village only four or five times in the
last year, mainly to drive into the main part of Serbia nearby. "There's
no freedom, but when you have to go, you go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One problem, he added, is that anyone from Kosovo wishing to drive to
other areas of Serbia must have Serbian license plates on the car, and so
most of Kosovo's Serbs have kept such plates. But ethnic Albanian drivers
use U.N.-issued license plates. That means Serbian vehicles are readily
identifiable.</TE>
<TE>   Radosava Milosavlevic, 52, also from Silovo, said that U.S. troops
used to escort her on visits to the cemetery of a village about two miles
away, where she lived for 25 years and where her son is buried.</TE>
<TE>   "But now the police won't provide escorts anymore," she complained.
"So I haven't visited his grave for a year. The lady from the police
said, 'If you want to go to that village, you can walk.' I said, 'I
wouldn't call you if I felt I were able to walk.' "</TE>
<TE>   Asked what she feared, Milosavlevic replied: "My old neighbors will do
something to me. Sometimes I call them to see how they are and they tell
me, 'Just forget this number.' "</TE>
<TE>   Zagorka Jacimovic, 64, also from Silovo, said her adult son
disappeared shortly after KFOR entered Kosovo and "we still don't know
whether he's alive or dead."</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't left the village since then, she said. "We just go from one
house to another," she said, fighting back tears. "It feels like we're in
jail."</TE>

<HD>Leftists Decry Italy's Labor Proposals</HD>
<DH>Europe: Hundreds of thousands rally against prime minister's
planned revisions to worker laws and denounce the slaying of an
economist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered Saturday to protest
efforts by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to make it easier to
fire workers. They also denounced the assassination of a government
advisor on labor reform.</LD>
<LD>   Union leaders claimed that at least 2 million people heeded their call
for the rally in the Italian capital, but the number appeared to be far
smaller. Rome's police headquarters put the count at more than 700,000.</LD>
<LD>   A sea of red caps, swirling red Communist flags and union banners
could be seen on the boulevard lining the Tiber River near the
demonstrators' rallying point in Circus Maximus, the ancient Roman space
for entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Before the rally began, heads were bowed for a minute of silence in
respect for Marco Biagi, an economist and government consultant who was
gunned down Tuesday in an attack claimed by an offshoot of the Red
Brigades, a leftist group that terrorized Italy with assassinations in
the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers declared that the rally would denounce the killing as an
assault on democracy. Biagi, through his role as a chief drafter of the
legislation aimed at ending Italy's system of virtual lifetime
employment, was an opponent of the unions.</TE>
<TE>   Many politicians from the center and left joined the rally, including
former Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a leader of the Democratic Party
of the Left, a former Communist party. "We're here to say no to
terrorism," D'Alema said.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the Communist-backed CGIL labor confederation, Sergio
Cofferati, told the crowd that the killing was carried out just when
"workers and citizens were mobilizing to claim their legitimate rights."</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi, in a message broadcast Friday on state TV and the media
magnate's private TV networks, reiterated his government's resolve to
push the employment reform through Parliament. Opposition politicians
immediately accused Berlusconi of taking advantage of Biagi's slaying to
push his agenda, noting that the televised appeal came on the eve of the
protest.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Minister Giovanni Alemanno said the big turnout didn't
ease the government's resolve to reform the labor laws. However, he
expressed concern about the prospect of a general strike in April.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi has invited unions to talks about the reform Tuesday, but
given that both sides have declared that they won't budge, it is unclear
what might come out of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to change labor laws has split the country, and Italy's main
labor confederations are calling for a general strike in April to protest
the reform.</TE>
<TE>   When Berlusconi first became prime minister in 1994, he backed off on
pension reform after mass protests by workers in the streets. His
government collapsed that year after eight months in office.</TE>
<TE>   "The government will soon realize that they are losing ground and they
will lose power as it happened in 1994," said factory worker Salvatore
Picco, 35, who was carrying his furled Communist flag after the rally as
he walked to a bus to travel back to Turin, several hundred miles to the
north.</TE>

<HD>Egypt Finds 2 Men Guilty in Spy Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>An Egyptian engineer was found guilty Saturday of spying for Israel
and sentenced to 15 years in jail with hard labor after President Hosni
Mubarak overturned a previous acquittal on the same charges.</LD>
<LD>   A fellow defendant identified as a Russian was found guilty in
absentia on the spy charges and sentenced to 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   The engineer, Sherif Filali, had been found not guilty of espionage in
an emergency state security court last June. A judge in that trial called
the Egyptian a true patriot because he turned himself in as soon as he
realized that he might have been involved in a crime.</LD>
<TE>   But Mubarak threw out the acquittal and ordered a retrial in
September. Filali has no right to appeal under Egypt's emergency laws,
which human rights groups have condemned as unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Rulings in emergency courts cannot be appealed and are subject to
Mubarak's review. The president can overturn the verdicts and order
retrials under an emergency law that has been in place since Muslim
militants killed President Anwar Sadat in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Filali, who fingered prayer beads in court, was accused of trying to
collect military information and data on Egyptian tourism and the
southern Toshka agricultural development program for Israel. Israel has
denied any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Court sources said the Russian man recruited Filali in Spain to obtain
secret information about Egypt for the Israeli intelligence agency
Mossad.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents said Filali shuttled between Egypt and Spain in 1999
before realizing the information he was collecting was for Mossad.</TE>

<HD>Gas Stove Blamed for Egypt Train Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors said Saturday that a portable gas stove caused a train
fire that killed 361 people last month, and they charged 11 railway
officials with negligence in Egypt's worst rail disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Fire ripped through seven carriages of a crowded passenger train in
February, the worst accident in 150 years of Egyptian rail history. The
blazing train rolled on for several miles after the fire broke out, the
wind fanning the flames.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said they had charged 11 medium- to low-ranking rail
officials with negligence and mistakes that led to the deaths. The
officials were also charged with ignoring railroad regulations.</LD>
<TE>   Transportation Minister Ibrahim Demeri resigned after the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors told a news conference that the train's 16 overcrowded
carriages were ferrying 4,000 people south from Cairo to the countryside
when the fire broke out from a small stove.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers often use portable gas stoves to brew tea or coffee on
trains.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said flammable material inside the train, including wooden
seats, quickly fed the flames, which engulfed seven of the rail cars.</TE>
<TE>   They said that the train did not have enough fire extinguishers and
that the ones that were there did not work properly.</TE>
<TE>   The train was so overcrowded that passengers were not able to activate
emergency brakes and warnings that would have alerted the driver and
stopped the train, they added.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers, many of whom were traveling home to spend a Muslim holiday
with family, jumped from the windows and doors of the rolling train.
Others died trapped inside the third-class carriages, some behind metal
window grilles.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the fire caused $345,000 in material damage in
addition to the loss of life.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 11 railway officials were also charged with falsifying
official papers that said the train was fit to carry passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Security sources said the defendants could face up to 15 years in
prison if convicted.</TE>

<LD>U.S. forces recently found evidence in Afghanistan that Osama bin
Laden was trying to "get his hands on" anthrax or other biological
weapons, the commander of the war effort said.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. troops have found nothing to show that Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network had succeeded in obtaining anthrax or making germ weapons, said
Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. forces recently discovered a site near the southern Afghan city
of Kandahar that appeared to be an Al Qaeda biological weapons lab under
construction. Franks discussed the find in an NBC interview taped
Saturday and airing today on "Meet the Press." The network provided an
excerpt Saturday.</LD>

<HD>Liberia Says Rebels Ambushed Loggers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MONROVIA, Liberia
</DL>
<LD>The government said Saturday that rebels had killed 15 people in an
ambush on logging trucks, but the group fighting to topple President
Charles Taylor said 60 soldiers had died in its attack on a military
convoy.</LD>
<LD>   Whichever account was closer to the truth, the violence Thursday was
the worst reported in the West African state since a regional effort to
bring the two sides together flopped when rebels boycotted recent talks.</LD>
<LD>   Founded by freed American slaves in the 19th century as a haven of
liberty, Liberia has known little but strife for more than a decade. Up
to 200,000 people died during civil war in the 1990s and the latest
conflict, which started two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Information Minister Reginald Goodridge said rebels of Liberians
United for Reconciliation and Democracy, or LURD, ambushed logging trucks
in an area about 50 miles north of Monrovia, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "This was purely a civilian massacre. They ambushed logging vehicles
and they massacred the people. This has nothing to do with the security
forces," Goodridge said. Fifteen people were known to have died in the
attack, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those boys in the bush are hungry and they have nowhere to go, so
they turned on civilians," Goodridge said.</TE>
<TE>   But a LURD spokesman said the group's forces ambushed a military
convoy that was heading toward its positions, killing 60 soldiers, taking
30 prisoners and seizing weapons and ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   "They decided to advance on our positions and in so doing they
sustained heavy casualties," William Hanson said.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are very pitiful and being used against their own will. We
regret it, but they just had to die because they came against our
positions."</TE>
<TE>   Independent confirmation of fighting is hard to obtain in a forested
region that many civilians have fled.</TE>
<TE>   The Economic Community of West African States tried to organize a
meeting involving rebels and government officials in Nigeria earlier this
month, but LURD said it was invited too late for its representatives to
attend.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia
</DL>
<LD>A naval chief hailed the sailors killed aboard the Kursk as heroes
who had prevented atomic disaster as Russia laid to rest on Saturday the
last of the bodies recovered from the submarine's wreck.</LD>
<LD>   The captain of the nuclear-powered submarine, Gennady Lyachin, was
among seven victims buried at St. Petersburg's Serafimov cemetery,
joining 25 crew members already laid to rest there.</LD>
<LD>   The commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, told
reporters after the funeral: "In sacrificing their lives, they saved
hundreds of thousands of people in northwestern Russia and Scandinavia,
preventing a possible atomic explosion of the reactor."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the factory that designed the Kursk says its reactors shut
off automatically, suggesting that the crew might have had little role in
preventing a possible nuclear accident.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 mourners placed flowers on the coffins. An armed honor
guard of naval officers wearing black overcoats fired a salute.</TE>
<TE>   The Kursk's crew of 118 was lost when the submarine sank in the
Barents Sea in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has identified and buried 115 of the bodies. The three
remaining crew members are believed to be unrecoverable.</TE>

<HD>Shiite Festival Clashes Injure 20 in Lebanon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NABATIYEH, Lebanon
</DL>
<LD>At least 20 people were hurt in running street battles between
rival Lebanese Shiite Muslim political groups on Saturday during an
annual religious festival, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Lebanese soldiers fired shots in the air to scatter members of
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and fellow Shiite group Amal who hurled
rocks and bottles at one another while marking the Muslim holiday of
Ashoura in the southern town of Nabatiyeh, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   At least one army officer and an ambulance worker were wounded in the
clashes, which witnesses said erupted when members of the two groups
argued over the assignment of places in a parade organized to celebrate
the holiday.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of cars were damaged in the skirmishes, which drifted into the
center of Nabatiyeh and continued to rage an hour after the army tried to
break them up.</TE>
<TE>   Ashoura commemorates the death of Hussein, the central figure of
Shiite Islam, and is an emotional 10-day event in Lebanon, during which
some Shiites beat and cut themselves until the blood runs while chanting
devotional songs.</TE>
<TE>   Nabatiyeh has traditionally been the site of the most exuberant
celebrations, though Hezbollah and senior Shiite clerics have implored
their communities in recent years not to engage in bloodletting.</TE>

<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Roughly 300 people died each day in traffic accidents in China last
year, a jump of 13% from the year before, highlighting the country's
dismal road safety record, state television said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Some 755,000 road wrecks killed 106,000 people last year, according to
China Central Television, which quoted the Ministry of Public Security,
the agency that oversees road safety.</LD>
<LD>   The ministry blamed the rise on the growing number of roads and
highways and an increase in traffic as China's economy develops.</LD>
<TE>   It said losses from last year's accidents totaled about $37 million,
representing a rise of 16%, but gave no figures for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Most accidents were the result of driver error, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlicensed drivers, drunk driving, dangerous passing, overloading and
speeding were the top causes of accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The soaring death toll prompted the State Council in December to issue
a law aimed at reinforcing safety measures and reducing road accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The government also issued new driving guidelines last year including
requirements that coach operators should drive in pairs, switching every
three hours, and that drivers should not be on the road for more than
eight hours over a 24-hour period.</TE>

<HD>Bosnian Says Terrorists Met to Plan Attack on Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda terrorists planned a devastating attack on Americans in
Sarajevo after meeting in Bulgaria to identify European targets, a
high-ranking Bosnian official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated
Press that intelligence reports on the meeting in Sofia, the Bulgarian
capital, prompted a special government session Thursday night to discuss
threats against the U.S. Embassy and embassies of European countries. He
did not name the countries.</LD>
<LD>   At the Sofia meeting, members of Al Qaeda decided that "in Sarajevo
something will happen to Americans similar to New York last September,"
said the official. He did not say when the Al Qaeda meeting was held or
who attended.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in Bosnia shut down to the public Wednesday after
receiving word of a possible terrorist threat. The embassy closed
entirely Friday, and the next day Bosnian special police forces were seen
around the compound along with normal U.S. security units.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jo-Anne Prokopowicz said
the embassy will remain closed over the weekend and that security
measures would be reviewed before deciding whether to reopen Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Pentagon said they had no information about a
specific Al Qaeda threat in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry said it had received no information on
such a meeting in Sofia, either "from Bosnian authorities or from any
other official sources." It promised an investigation if "this
information proves to be serious" and ordered the embassy in Sarajevo to
look into the situation.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bulgarian Interior Ministry official, Boiko Borisov, and
national police chief Vasil Vasilev both said in televised comments that
they knew nothing about any Bulgarian connection in the alleged Sarajevo
plot. "I don't know what this information is about," Vasilev said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, just a day before the U.S. Embassy received the threats,
Bosnian police raided an Islamic charity, Bosnian Ideal Future, also
known as Benevolentia International Foundation, seizing weapons, plans
for making bombs, booby-traps and bogus passports.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, police said they had arrested Munib Zahiragic, a Bosnian
citizen and the head of the Bosnian chapter of the charity. Zahiragic is
also a former member of the Bosnian Muslim secret police, AID.</TE>
<TE>   Zahiragic was arrested on charges of espionage, which carry a maximum
10 years in prison. No details on whom he was supposed to be spying for
were released.</TE>
<TE>   As a part of the war on terrorism, Bosnia's government in January
ordered an investigation into the work of foreign humanitarian agencies.
Two weeks ago, investigators reported funds were missing from three
Islamic charities, among them Benevolentia.</TE>

<HD>Rift Between Yugoslav President, Serbian Leader Deepens</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Dispute over whether to fire army official threatens to
paralyze the government. Fight is tied to spy case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>The prime minister of Yugoslavia's dominant republic will sever all
cooperation with Yugoslavia's president for not firing a general involved
in an alleged U.S. spying affair, a senior official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The comments by Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic represent a
further escalation in the rivalries between Serbian Prime Minister Zoran
Djindjic and Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica.</LD>
<LD>   Increased tensions between the two threaten to paralyze the workings
of government at a time when Yugoslavia and Serbia need to show progress
in democratic and economic development to enjoy continued Western
support. Serbia is home to more than 90% of Yugoslav citizens and
effectively sets Yugoslav policy.</LD>
<TE>   Djindjic and Kostunica cooperated in ousting former President Slobodan
Milosevic after he lost elections in late 2000 but have drifted apart
since. Kostunica, a nationalist, opposed Milosevic's extradition to the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands, a move orchestrated by
Djindjic as part of moving the country into the Western camp.</TE>
<TE>   In comments to the Associated Press, Batic accused Kostunica of
"protecting and cuddling Milosevic's cronies," an apparent reference to
Gen. Aco Tomic, the head of Yugoslav army intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no more cooperation with Kostunica, because we cannot
cooperate with someone who protects criminals," Batic said, suggesting,
without details, that Kostunica might be making himself criminally
responsible by refusing to fire Tomic.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the military's arrest of a senior Serbian government
figure March 14 who allegedly was spying for the United States, the
Serbian government accused the general of contravening the law by failing
to inform it of the case while reporting to Kostunica.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this past week in an interview in Belgrade's daily Blic,
Kostunica said that he would fire Tomic only if he "was sure that he
breached existing rules and regulations."</TE>
<TE>   "However, everything points to the fact that this was not the case and
that Gen. Tomic, [military] security and the Yugoslav army have acted
according to the existing regulations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing supporters Saturday in Nis, about 125 miles south of
Belgrade, the capital, Djindjic said he expected a "reshuffle of the
army's leadership" Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He accused Tomic of eavesdropping on private meetings between himself
and Kostunica. "In [a] number of occasions we were discussing national
security, and Tomic was in the room next door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The military says Momcilo Perisic, who resigned as Serbian deputy
prime minister after he was released from detention March 16, was handing
over top secret documents to a U.S. diplomat, John David Neighbor. Other
Yugoslav officials have said the documents could have been used against
Milosevic at his U.N. war crimes trial in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   In a breach of international conventions, Neighbor was held
incommunicado for 15 hours--at times with a hood over his head--and
reportedly beaten up. The United States protested his treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Both the United States and Perisic--a former chief of the Yugoslav
army's general staff fired in 1998 for opposing Milosevic's policies in
Serbia's southern province of Kosovo--have denied that any espionage took
place.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic and his allies argued that Perisic's arrest was aimed at
undermining the Serbian government and meant to prevent possible arrests
of more Serb war crimes suspects and their extradition to the war crimes
court in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Congress has set a March 31 deadline for Yugoslav authorities
to cooperate with the U.N. tribunal or forfeit financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica has continued to defy international demands to hand over
about a dozen other suspects, including top officials of Milosevic's
fallen regime.</TE>

<HD>2 Suspects Held in Colombian Senator's Hijacking, Abduction</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The Colombian army on Saturday captured two suspected rebels
accused of hijacking a jetliner to kidnap a senator on board--an incident
that escalated the country's decades-long civil war.</LD>
<LD>   The Feb. 20 hijacking prompted the Colombian government to end three
years of peace talks with the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers captured the two suspected FARC members and four others
during a military operation in Ibague, 80 miles southwest of Bogota, the
Colombian capital, according to army Gen. Hernan Cadavid.</LD>
<TE>   Four armed hijackers seized control of the Aires airliner last month
and forced it to land in a southern valley.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC is believed to still be holding Sen. Jorge Gechen Turbay
hostage. The other 29 passengers and crew were freed unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   In separate operations, security forces captured 11 other rebels and
five members of a rival rightist paramilitary group, authorities said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Since President Andres Pastrana ended peace talks with the FARC,
rebels have increased their attacks on Colombia's infrastructure, bombing
bridges and electrical and communications towers.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,500 people are killed annually in the civil war.</TE>

<HD>FBI Denies That Hijacker Had Skin Anthrax</HD>
<DH>Infection: A doctor treated the terrorist for a leg lesion last
summer. Biodefense experts say he probably had the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>FBI officials said Saturday that a report that one of the Sept. 11
terrorists may have had a case of cutaneous anthrax last summer is just
one of many dead-end leads that have bedeviled investigators.</LD>
<LD>   A Florida doctor who treated Ahmed Ibrahim A. Al Haznawi for a dark
lesion on his leg in June now believes that wound may have been caused by
exposure to anthrax, according to experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for
Civilian Biodefense Strategies. The case was first reported Saturday by
the New York Times.</LD>
<LD>   That information persuaded the bioterrorism experts that there may be
a link between the terrorists--who hijacked four planes Sept. 11,
crashing two into the World Trade Center and another into the
Pentagon--and the subsequent mailings of anthrax-laced letters.</LD>
<TE>   After interviewing Dr. Christos Tsonas, who treated Haznawi at Holy
Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, the experts concluded that cutaneous
anthrax was "the most probable and coherent interpretation of the data
available," they wrote in a recent memorandum that has circulated among
federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday, FBI officials said they still believe the 19 hijackers
never came into contact with anthrax, noting that authorities scoured
their cars, apartments and personal effects for traces of the deadly
bacteria and found none.</TE>
<TE>   "This was fully investigated and widely vetted among multiple agencies
several months ago," FBI chief spokesman John E. Collingwood said in a
statement in response to the report. "Exhaustive testing did not support
that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been."</TE>
<TE>   "While we always welcome new information, nothing new has in fact
developed," said Collingwood, an FBI assistant director.</TE>
<TE>   Another FBI official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because
the anthrax case is ongoing, confirmed that one of the hijackers had been
treated at a South Florida hospital for a "leg lesion" and that the
suspected lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had sought treatment for skin
irritation on at least one of his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents, coupled with the hijackers' reported interest in
gaining access to crop dusters, would appear to give some credence to the
theory that the Sept. 11 attacks could be somehow linked to the anthrax
mailings, the FBI official acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   But the official said FBI agents, a battery of specially trained
scientists and other biochemical experts all had aggressively
investigated the issue and found no connections.</TE>
<TE>   "We did look into this some time ago. This was fully investigated,"
said the FBI official. "It's a theory, but there's no evidence. It's just
not there. We just have no evidence to feed the speculation that any of
those guys came into contact with anthrax."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI hypothesizes that the anthrax mailings are the work of a
disgruntled American male loner with some kind of scientific expertise,
access to anthrax and a laboratory, and some kind of grudge against the
government.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Justice Department official, also speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said recently that authorities are so stumped by who may
have sent the envelopes that investigators fear they may be in for a
"Unabomber-type investigation," in which it may take years--and a lucky
break--to determine who was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents believe their most promising avenue for solving the mystery
may be a scientific breakthrough that can distinguish between stocks of
the virulent Ames strain of anthrax, which was used to kill five people
and sicken at least 13 others last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Tsonas could not be reached for comment Saturday. A spokeswoman for
Holy Cross Hospital said it is cooperating with authorities but, at their
request, would not discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Tsonas said Haznawi came to the Holy Cross emergency room with another
man, believed to have been hijacker Ziad Samir Jarrah, according to the
New York Times. Haznawi told Tsonas that he developed the sore after
bumping into a suitcase. Tsonas cleaned the lesion and prescribed an
antibiotic. He never considered that the infection was anthrax--a rarely
seen disease at that point--until he reviewed the case in October at
investigators' request.</TE>
<TE>   Steven M. Block, a professor of biology and applied physics at
Stanford University who has advised the government on bioterrorism,
cautioned against making assumptions based on the report that Haznawi may
have had an anthrax lesion.</TE>
<TE>   "This may or may not be related to the anthrax letters that killed Bob
Stevens and four others," he said, referring to the first anthrax victim,
a photo editor at American Media Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of possibilities here," Block said. "One shouldn't
jump to conclusions."</TE>

<HD>Tuned to the Far Right of the Dial</HD>
<DH>Montana: In the heart of the militia belt, radio host John Stokes'
show plays to the anger some feel over the federal government's controls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KALISPELL, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>In a tour of Montana's landmarks of the far right, one stop would
be a squat black building outside of Kalispell, with an American flag
painted on the side. From the Z-600 radio studio each morning, John
Stokes straps on his headset for "The Edge," and the Flathead Valley gets
ready to get riled.</LD>
<LD>   It is talk radio for people who think Rush Limbaugh has gone soft. In
the Flathead, deep in the heart of the country's militia belt, Stokes
outdraws Limbaugh when they go head to head in the mornings. He is one of
the best-known radio figures in northwest Montana--and the most vilified.</LD>
<LD>   Of a Holocaust survivor who visited Montana recently, Stokes had this
to say: "Too bad, so sad. Get over it." Environmentalists, he said,
"should all be rounded up and put in an internment campground." On Martin
Luther King Day this year, he wondered why retailers weren't celebrating.
"I mean, can't they have, like, sheet specials?"</LD>
<TE>   Stokes' program has become a lightning rod for the anger that has
fueled anti-government militancy, tapping widespread resentment about
declining logging, grazing restrictions, controls on private property,
mine closures and aluminum smelters being shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   "Rural America is screaming right now, and people who can't hear that
roar have to basically be deaf," says Stokes, 50, who was a real estate
broker in San Diego and Seattle before settling in Montana. "I don't
distrust the government at all. I'm not anti-government. But we are
anti-stupidity. And the left and the right both have a lot of stupidity."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when police uncovered a large weapon cache and a list
purportedly targeting local police, judges and prosecutors for
assassination, an occasional caller to Stokes' radio program, 38-year-old
businessman David Burgert, was identified as the ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the group, known as Project 7, hoped to arm a citizens'
militia that would face off against the National Guard and, eventually,
troops sent in by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United
Nations.</TE>
<TE>   But reaction to the arrests has been nearly eclipsed by the mounting
outcry about Stokes, who is accused of pouring gasoline on the fire of
the militant right.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a high-voltage welcome wagon for right-wing extremism," said Ben
Long, an activist in the local chapter of the Montana Human Rights
Network. "His style, his rhetoric, has permeated the debate on natural
resource issues all over the valley."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff, the police chief, the local Chamber of Commerce and the
school superintendent all have repudiated Stokes' description of
environmentalists as "green Nazis." The Republican governor, Judy Martz,
has refused to appear on his show.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the controversy has brought this tranquil valley,
home to the scenic splendors of Glacier National Park and Flathead Lake,
to open hostility. Environmentalists have had their cars vandalized. They
report mysterious pickups parked outside their homes and offices, abusive
late-night telephone calls and threatening mail.</TE>
<TE>   "You desirve [sic] everything your [sic] going to recieve [sic], such
as a train ride, like the Jews got to take," said one e-mail sent to
Keith Hammer, chairman of the Swan View Coalition, a conservation group.</TE>
<TE>   "Take your group of green Nazis to hell with you," another said. "We
are watching you very closely, know your every move, and we will get you
out of this state you can count on it."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Stokes' critics, apparently, have been willing to dish back. A
flier with a photo of Stokes' house was distributed all over town
recently, with the words, "Meet your neighbors, John and Pam Stokes. . .
. Stop by and give them a Montana welcome for what they bring to our
community."</TE>
<TE>   The word "hater" was spray-painted on the radio station building. Two
months ago, Stokes got an unsigned letter: "It's over between you and
Judy [most likely referring to the governor]. Too bad, so sad. Get over
it. . . . You're going to be as welcome around here as a Ku Klux Klan
member in Harlem."</TE>
<TE>   Police didn't take the acrimony too seriously at first. The Kalispell
man who sent Hammer the threatening e-mails was contacted by the sheriff
and told to "knock it off."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Kitterman, a Kalispell high school junior, said police paid
little attention when she and her mother, Brenda Kitterman, were harassed
last spring after being targeted on Stokes' radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Kitterman had written an article in the school newspaper about
Holocaust survivor Klaus Stern, who spoke to Kalispell community groups
in May. She quoted Stern denouncing Stokes for using the phrase "green
Nazis." Stokes criticized the article on the air, saying Kitterman had
been "brainwashed" and admonished Stern, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't come preaching to me or trying to get sympathy . . . and say,
'I'm a victim because the Nazis killed my family,' " Stokes said. "Well,
you should've stood up for yourself when you had the time."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after that, Elizabeth Kitterman was followed home one night
after getting off work at the Sizzler. On one occasion, an old green
pickup trailed her to the bowling alley, and the driver aimed a shotgun
out the window at her.</TE>
<TE>   The police began to take the issue more seriously when Project 7
surfaced. At the home of Burgert's girlfriend, Tracy Brockway, police
found assault weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition, explosives
mixture, survival equipment--and the list of names.</TE>
<TE>   Burgert says there is no murder plot. "Murder is unacceptable," he
told the local paper, the Daily Inter Lake, in a telephone call from the
county jail. The weapons, he said, were to enable citizens to come to the
nation's defense in case a foreign country invaded.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes, who regularly reins in callers to his show who talk about
violence, said police are overreacting.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time I met [Burgert], he's all talk. And now he's the leader
of what? Him and his girlfriend? To me, it was just like 'Spanky and Our
Gang.' 'OK, guys, what should we do?' "</TE>
<TE>   He is equally perplexed about the letters that poured in when he led
demonstrators in burning a green swastika in April on Earth Day to
protest "the eco-fascists."</TE>
<TE>   "I called them green Nazis and they went freakin' crazy!" Stokes said.
"But you look at the events that led up to the Third Reich. You see the
parallels today, and it's uncanny. The way they went after the youth.
'Save the whales.' 'Save the forests.'. . . Anybody they want to vilify,
they call them a Nazi, and I think they're really [mad] I beat them to
the punch on this one."</TE>
<TE>   For Stokes, moving to Montana was the culmination of a lifetime of
searching for a place he could consider home. He lived for several years
in Seattle, then moved to San Diego in the late 1970s, where he sold real
estate and piloted a commercial hot air balloon. By the 1980s, he was
back in Seattle, trying to develop a lakefront residential project in
Snohomish County.</TE>
<TE>   The project ran into regulations limiting development in wetlands,
costing Stokes millions of dollars. In the end, he felt so abused he
launched a move to secede from Snohomish County and form a new county,
"Freedom County," an enterprise that inspired secessionist movements
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, Stokes was fed up with Washington. He settled on
Kalispell--a town of 13,000 in the timbered hills of northwest Montana,
about 125 miles north of Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   "I went all around America looking for some place that looked like the
place I wanted to raise my kids and retire in," he said. "Kalispell is
what Washington used to be 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   He made the move in 1992. Almost immediately, Stokes got into the
thick of things. A major land use plan was being drafted to control huge
growth rates in Flathead County, and Stokes helped organize Montanans for
Property Rights, which took credit for defeating the measure at the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent guest on the local radio talk show, Stokes bought the AM
station in May 2000 and began co-hosting "The Edge" every morning with
his wife, Pamela. He changed the music format to hard-core alternative
rock. The station's ratings have been only so-so, though "The Edge" has
outpaced Limbaugh in its time slot and garnered a strong following among
young and middle-age men.</TE>
<TE>   There is a natural audience here. In a county where the federal
government owns 82% of the land, many get impatient at new restrictions
on mining, the closure of forest roads and logging cutbacks. Most of
those ideas, many feel, come from environmentalists who aren't originally
from around here.</TE>
<TE>   Logger Donna Thornton said Stokes speaks to people who see a way of
life disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of folks around here are people who are fed up with
being controlled from some place like Washington, D.C.," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't always agree with everything John Stokes says on the air, but
John is providing three hours a day for people to get their issues out
and for people to present their frustrations."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said people like Stokes shout down legitimate debate.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the Montana tradition is neighbor helping neighbor. You don't
let politics come between neighbors," Hammer said. "But Stokes had been
here less than three months, and the place started coming unglued.
Immediately."</TE>
<TE>   With Stokes and his supporters, he said, "it's people who feel like
they have the ultimately correct view of the world, and people who
disagree with them ought to be run out or shot. And not necessarily in
that order."</TE>

<LD>Nearly 1,800 people flapped their arms and legs in fresh snow on
the Capitol mall in Bismarck, N.D., hoping to create a record for making
the most simultaneous snow angels.</LD>
<LD>   The event, which quickly degenerated into a huge snowball fight, was
organized to promote a new exhibit for the state historical society.
Bismarck broke a 108-year-old snowfall record Wednesday, when 5.4 inches
fell the first day of spring.</LD>
<LD>   To officially mark a record, the state historical society recorded the
name, address and age of each participant. The list will be shipped to
Guinness Book of Records headquarters in London.</LD>

<LD>Starting his campaign in the hometown of the man shaping up to be
his Democratic rival, Republican Gov. Dirk Kempthorne announced in Idaho
Falls that he will seek a second term. He said that, despite the state's
economic crisis, he and lawmakers have balanced the budget without
raising taxes.</LD>
<LD>   After six years as a U.S. senator, Kempthorne won the state's top
office in 1998 with 67% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   No serious opposition has surfaced for the May 28 GOP primary, and it
appears Kempthorne will face Democrat Jerry Brady, publisher of the
newspaper in Idaho Falls, in November.</LD>

<HD>32 Homes Burned in New Mexico Fires</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALTO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>Wind-whipped grass fires pushed into affluent residential areas in
the pine-studded southern New Mexico mountains Saturday, burning at least
32 homes and forcing more than 1,300 residents to evacuate.</LD>
<LD>   Two fires consumed at least 3,400 acres, including 1,000 acres in the
Kokopelli Fire, named after a subdivision where the homes burned,
firefighters said.</LD>
<LD>   A third blaze, called the 5-2 Fire, which started on the Mescalero
Apache reservation, burned about 2,400 acres, according to the state
Public Safety Department.</LD>
<TE>   No injuries have been reported, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kokopelli fire started around noon in a residential driveway,
Lincoln County Sheriff Tom Sullivan said. He said the possibility of
arson was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very suspicious the way it started," Sullivan said. "It's just
in an area where there wasn't anybody around. We're just not sure why it
got started there."</TE>
<TE>   Terri Wildermuth, spokeswoman for the state Forestry Division, said
the Kokopelli fire was "human caused" but declined to elaborate. She said
the cause of the other fire had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Three air tankers dropped retardant on the fires, but the winds were
so intense that planes and helicopters were grounded in the evening, said
Gwen Shaffer, Forest Service spokeswoman. Gusts up to 60 mph were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Winds died down after sundown, and firefighters said that mostly
unpopulated, open country remained in the path of the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Police Lt. Wolf Born said the 32 homes were burned north and northeast
of Ruidoso, a mountain resort known for skiing in the winter and horse
racing in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gary Johnson said more than 1,300 people had been evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad news--it's really bad news," Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Foes Seize on Reports of Cancer Link in Ad Campaign</HD>
<DH>Health: Several studies suggesting increased risk of developing
breast tumors are disputed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>Billboards here warn, under the silhouette of a pregnant woman,
that "abortion increases your risk for breast cancer." Radio spots and
newspaper ads push similar messages elsewhere in the country. A TV
commercial even features a high school coach telling her girls'
volleyball team that she wished she had known all the risks before ending
a pregnancy years ago.</LD>
<LD>   This is the ferocious new front line in the abortion wars.</LD>
<LD>   Antiabortion activists from coast to coast are buying advertising,
lobbying for legislation, even filing lawsuits in an all-out effort to
publicize several hotly disputed studies that suggest having an abortion
can raise some women's risk of developing breast cancer by 50% or more.</LD>
<TE>   The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have
declared there is no conclusive evidence linking abortion and breast
cancer. Their experts contend that the studies suggesting such a link are
flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue has been resolved scientifically," said Dr. Michael Thun,
director of epidemiology research for the cancer society. "This is
essentially a political debate."</TE>
<TE>   But antiabortion forces refuse to concede on the science. Instead,
they speak of a "conspiracy of silence" in the media and the medical
community to hush research that would raise doubts about the safety of
abortion. They acknowledge that some studies have found no link between
abortion and breast cancer. But they say the fact that two dozen studies
worldwide--many of them published in respected, peer-reviewed
journals--have found at least a tenuous association is reason enough to
warn women.</TE>
<TE>   And now they are attempting to use the courts to go after abortion
providers who try to reassure their patients that there's nothing to the
alleged breast cancer link.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to chip away at abortion rights in any way they can,"
said Janet Crepps, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy in New York. "This is a new avenue of attack on the same old
theme."</TE>
<TE>   The first trial on this issue is set to begin Monday in Fargo, N.D.
Activists there are suing the Red River Women's Clinic--the only abortion
provider in North Dakota--over a brochure declaring that "none" of the
claims about an abortion-cancer link "are supported by medical research."</TE>
<TE>   Under North Dakota law, any citizen can bring a "public interest"
lawsuit to try to block false advertising. The plaintiffs are not seeking
monetary damages. Instead, they are demanding that the court require the
clinic to warn its patients about the potential cancer risk.</TE>
<TE>   Activists in San Diego filed a similar suit against a Planned
Parenthood clinic there, but a superior court judge on Tuesday dismissed
the case. Judge Ronald Prager ruled that the link between abortion and
breast cancer has not been proved. Requiring Planned Parenthood to
provide the information, Prager said, "would, in effect, result in
judicial intervention in the doctor/patient relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Salo, president of Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside
counties, hailed the decision. "Misleading women is a desperate strategy,
and the antiabortion extremists ought to be ashamed of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   But John Kindley, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he is appealing
Prager's ruling. And he is counting on the trial in North Dakota, which
is expected to last three days, to "set the precedent that women have a
right to be informed."</TE>
<TE>   If mainstream medical experts won't issue the warnings, those in the
antiabortion movement will do it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Two freeway billboards sponsored by a local Right to Life group have
gone up in St. Louis County this year, at a cost of $4,800 a month. The
chapter, with about 150 active members, raises the money through garage
sales, Christmas card sales and donations. Similar billboards have been
put up in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, New Jersey and North Dakota over the
last few years. And there have been posters hung in the subways and buses
in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The TV commercial featuring the volleyball coach--produced in English
and Spanish--has aired on several Phoenix stations. And a national group
is appealing for donations to buy air time in other markets, starting in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think it's gaining momentum," said Karen Malec,
president of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer, which has assembled
thousands of pages of research on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to use every avenue we can to get the message out,"
agreed Connie Pratt, an activist for a Right to Life chapter in Colorado
Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Pratt's chapter has raised at least $18,000 in recent years to
publicize the cancer research, mailing out thousands of bumper stickers,
setting up booths at sports events and putting quarter-page ads in the
local newspaper. They even sponsored a billboard in a minor league
baseball park.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide Right to Life group in Colorado, meanwhile, went so far
as to hire a mobile billboard-on-a-truck to trail walkathons raising
money for breast cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   Activists are pushing the issue into statehouses as well.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers in Missouri, Oklahoma and Rhode Island are considering
legislation that would require abortion providers to tell their patients
about the cancer research. "I don't know if they would do it on their
own," said Missouri state Sen. Peter Kinder, a Republican who supports
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, Alabama and Iowa are weighing more general "informed consent"
bills that supporters believe could be tailored to require similar
disclosures. Four states--Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and
Montana--already have such laws on the books.</TE>
<TE>   To abortion rights advocates, such campaigns are a transparent effort
to scare women from exercising their legal right to end unwanted
pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   And indeed, some activists admit that's why they have latched on to
the breast cancer issue. "I am into this because I want women to stop
killing their babies. They don't seem to do it for the sake of the
babies, so I'm hoping they'll do it for their own sakes," said Sue
Metherd, president of the Right to Life chapter in south St. Louis
County.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, insist they are simply trying to inform women of all
the facts so they can make their own health decisions. If a woman does
choose abortion, they say, at least the warnings might prompt her to be
more vigilant about mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   "Cigarette warning labels didn't restrict anyone's right to smoke.
They just gave smokers more information about the risks," said Joel
Brind, a biologist at the City University of New York who founded the
Breast Cancer Prevention Institute in part to spread his conviction that
abortion can trigger tumors.</TE>
<TE>   The science behind the rhetoric plays out like this:</TE>
<TE>   It is widely accepted that carrying a pregnancy to term before age 30
helps to protect women against breast cancer. Women who terminate their
pregnancies forgo this protective effect. But that does not necessarily
mean abortion itself increases the risk of cancer, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The main studies that implicate abortion as a risk factor were
conducted by asking women with breast cancer about their medical
histories. Researchers then compared those subjects to similar women who
had not developed cancer. There was a correlation between abortion and
cancer; it was especially strong among women who had ended pregnancies as
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers at the American Cancer Society and elsewhere contend
such studies are not reliable because women who have developed cancer are
far more likely to report every detail of their histories than women who
are healthy.</TE>
<TE>   They put more stock in studies such as a 1997 report from Denmark,
which looked at the medical charts of every woman in the country born
over several decades. Every abortion and case of cancer in Denmark is
supposed to be reported to a national registry; scouring those databanks,
researchers found no correlation between abortions and breast tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics also point out that even the studies implicating abortion as
a risk factor show it's no more significant for most women than other
documented--but rarely fretted about--ones, such as living in an urban
area, being tall or having an advanced education.</TE>
<TE>   So abortion rights advocates say it's not only unnecessary but also
irresponsible to raise the issue with patients.</TE>
<TE>   "It just adds unnecessary grief at a very stressful time in their
lives," Crepps said.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Bovard, director of the Red River clinic, is more blunt: "You're
playing with their brains. It's a scare tactic."</TE>
<TE>   And one she doubts would work.</TE>
<TE>   Women drive to her clinic from across North Dakota--up to six hours
one way--because they are desperate to end unwanted pregnancies. Often
they must pass a prayer group of men with rosaries outside the clinic
door. Sometimes there are louder, fiercer protests to wade through. And
there is a waiting period set by state law: Patients must be offered
booklets on fetal development and abortion alternatives 24 hours before
the doctor will see them.</TE>
<TE>   Still they come, about 100 a month. And Bovard is sure they would
continue to come even if she were required to tell them about the
conflicting studies on cancer risk.</TE>
<TE>   When the lawsuit was filed against her clinic, Bovard dropped the
brochure asserting that no medical research supported an abortion-cancer
connection. Her new pamphlet is only slightly more tempered: It says "a
substantial body of medical research indicates that there is no
established link."</TE>
<TE>   Antiabortion activists contend the new brochure is as misleading as
the old one. But Thun, of the American Cancer Society, says it's right on
target.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a real upsurge in activity about this issue by opponents of
abortion," he said. "[But] there is no evidence that the procedure of
induced abortion affects breast cancer risk."</TE>

School over allegations that he had molested students incorrectly
reported that two boys were allegedly molested during a school field
trip. That incident allegedly occurred during an outing that was not

were established in 1992, not 1982.</LD>

<HD>West Virginia 4-H Drops Indian Events</HD>
<DH>Culture: A formal complaint that the group's summer camp program
was offensive leads to changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>For 80 years, 4-H members at summer camp in West Virginia have
split off into tribes and followed rituals patterned after Native
American customs, from copying rain dances to wearing headdresses to
creating self-styled tribal yells.</LD>
<LD>   Now the practice--a large part of the summer camps themselves--is
being eliminated because of a formal complaint that it is offensive to
Native Americans.</LD>
<LD>   "As difficult and emotional as this issue is for many people, we
believe it is the right thing to do," said Larry Cote, director of the
West Virginia University Extension Service, which is responsible for 4-H
in West Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   "We had no idea that our program was as hurtful to Native Americans as
it was," Cote said. "It's important that we don't teach children
practices that in any way demean a race, perpetuate stereotypes or
trivialize sacred customs."</TE>
<TE>   Cote would not say who filed the complaint; West Virginia has more
than 10,000 full- or mixed-blood Native Americans, according to the 2000
census.</TE>
<TE>   The change also was recommended by a group of national 4-H leaders
that recently reviewed West Virginia's program, Cote said.</TE>
<TE>   At least three other states--Delaware, Maryland and Virginia--have
similar 4-H camps, Cote said. Representatives of those states' extension
agencies didn't return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In West Virginia, a statewide group of extension agents, volunteer 4-H
leaders and members is now considering how to restructure this year's
summer camping season, which begins in June.</TE>
<TE>   "The change is really going to be very difficult because campers and
leaders think we do it out of respect. At no point do we think we are
making fun," said Kate Burbank, who has been an extension agent for 32
years in Roane County.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for 4-H is provided through a partnership between the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Cooperative State Research Education and
Extension Service, the state extension service and county commissions.</TE>
<TE>   The state extension service could have lost at least $4.5 million a
year in federal funds if it had been penalized by the USDA, and the
university could have lost millions more in federal research dollars,
Cote said.</TE>
<TE>   4-H, which is celebrating its centennial this year, is a federally
organized youth educational program based in rural, agricultural
communities across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   During most of the year, 4-H'ers have club meetings, perform community
service and work on service projects, such as raising animals for show,
and in summer they head to camp.</TE>
<TE>   At county camps statewide and at the state 4-H camp, West Virginia
4-H'ers since the 1920s have been divided into four tribes: Cherokee,
Delaware, Mingo and Seneca. The tribes compete in sports and other events
and gather each evening around a campfire in a council circle.</TE>
<TE>   Skits, stunts and songs performed at the circle are peppered with
Native American references. Some male campers have been called
short-braids, and female campers long-braids. Adults are called Big Feet,
and the camp director is the Big Chief.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Bellecourt of the American Indian Movement, based in
Minneapolis, said West Virginia should be applauded for trying to end
demeaning stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem if the 4-H wants to teach that we are stewards of
the environment and teach our spirituality and philosophies, but not if
they play Indian," Bellecourt said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the operation of 4-H camps and their themes are up to each
state, said Allan Smith of the USDA Cooperative State Research Education
and Extension Service.</TE>
<TE>   Kaila Foust, 16, of Princeton, W.Va., has been attending 4-H camp for
eight years in Mercer County, where she is a member of the camp's Seneca
Tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to affect us a lot," she said. "Council circle brings the
whole group together at night so we can sing songs, do funny skits and
just be together."</TE>

<HD>Phoenix Neighborhood Determined to Halt Invasion by Vermin</HD>
<DH>Rats: Furry visitors from Central California threaten the citrus
industry. Residents have mobilized against them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>In another procession of unwanted coastal imports, the latest to
infest this state comes from, of course, California. Only this time
Arizona isn't inheriting its haughty neighbor's noxious air, snarled
traffic or even suburban sprawl. Now it's rats.</LD>
<LD>   The big-eared, ropy-tailed pests hitched a ride in trucks from Central
California's citrus groves and have taken up residence in the roofs of
one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, known for its forest of fruit
trees. The rats have been gorging on oranges, tangerines and grapefruits
for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   While the thousands of roof rats don't yet pose a health hazard, state
officials fear that if the infestation is not contained, the rats may
find their way to Arizona's lucrative commercial citrus groves.</LD>
<TE>   The critters' incessant gnawing already has caused at least one house
fire, after a rat chewed through electrical wiring in an attic. They are
also getting into power substations and have been responsible for
outages.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a siege. Almost overnight, this quiet neighborhood has
been inundated with fliers from extermination companies, fruit pickers
and landscaping firms offering help in the fight. Construction-size trash
bins are parked on street corners where residents can dump fruit, which
the rats rely on for food and water.</TE>
<TE>   So far, thousands of tons of citrus have been harvested, and food
banks are no longer accepting fruit. The excess is being trucked to
Indian reservations in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We are onto something here that is a little challenging, to say the
least," said Al Brown, director of the Maricopa County Environmental
Services Department, whose job it is to eradicate the rats.</TE>
<TE>   Most rodents aren't native to Arizona, other than tiny desert pack
rats. In fact, urban rats are so uncommon here that the county has no
rodent control plan.</TE>
<TE>   That became obvious to residents when they called a community meeting
last month to solicit help from their local government. In an elementary
school cafeteria overflowing with more than 500 spooked homeowners,
county officials shrugged and acknowledged that government could do only
so much.</TE>
<TE>   In just weeks, residents have mobilized, and the area is replete with
home-grown pied pipers. Here, in an enclave on the edge of Scottsdale
known as Arcadia, residents have organized a massive door-to-door
campaign to rid themselves of Rattus rattus, which roosts in attics and
creeps out at night to feast on citrus.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of residents have organized into work gangs, pulling fruit
off the trees, cutting house-hugging shrubs for elderly neighbors and
even loaning cats and dogs for patrol duty.</TE>
<TE>   In sidewalk confabs, residents discuss their disgust with the invasion
and their conviction that the whole thing is just another unwholesome
hand-me-down from California.</TE>
<TE>   "Like we always say, eventually, we get everything from California,
like it or not," huffed one resident.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenicians are tough desert dwellers who scarcely flinch over finding
black widows and scorpions in their backyards. But the rats are
unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   They began showing up in late December, but their booming population
became apparent in recent weeks. A female and her offspring can account
for as many as 7,000 rats a year, health officials said. Because the rats
have a life span of just about a year, the attics and trees here are a
virtual nursery teeming with pups.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Paceley and his wife, Joan, are longtime Arcadia residents and
began the anti-rat campaign Arcadia Neighbor to Neighbor with the help of
block watches, homeowners associations, churches, schools and the Boy
Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   The group has at least one person who monitors each block, and there
is a hotline to call for help. On weekends, members of the group fan out
to pull fruit off neighborhood trees.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they loathe them, residents pointedly note the California
rats' exceptional lack of toughness. In rodent manuals, the
urban-dwelling Norway rat is described as "large and robust," while the
6-inch, brownish roof rat is noted as "sleek and graceful."</TE>
<TE>   Scores have drowned after leaning over the edges of backyard swimming
pools and falling in. Nor do the creatures seem to be able to negotiate
the swift-running Arizona Canal that bisects Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   Paceley, meaning only to shoo one off his patio, said he inadvertently
exterminated a roof rat with a soft tap of a broom handle. Another time
he caught one and put it in the backyard with his cat, attempting to
train the feline to recognize the rat's scent. Two tentative swipes from
the cat and the rat was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't tough at all, not like a good New York rat," Paceley
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rats seem to be using Kathy Bishop's house as a staging area. Her
property has only one small orange tree, but Bishop is convinced the rats
at her house are making nightly forays into the neighbors' trees.</TE>
<TE>   "One night I heard a sound on the roof, like a tiny stampede," she
said, shuddering. "We thought it was a cat. My friend has them and she
says it sounds like they are playing soccer in your attic. They say these
rats are quiet but, believe me, if you've got them, you know it."</TE>
<TE>   The desert neighborhood's lushness could prove to be its downfall. The
area's bearded palms, oleanders and bougainvillea will become homes for
the rats when the summer heat drives them out of attics. Residents have
been told to dramatically trim plants and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   The county has placed nearly 10,000 bait traps on top of utility
poles, readying for the exodus. County health officials concede
eradication is not likely but are optimistic the rats can be contained to
Arcadia's 18 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   John and Nancy Savoy watched as their family dog barked madly at the
dozens of orange trees in their backyard. They never knew rats were in
the trees until John noticed the telltale "orange carcass"--a
quarter-sized hole where a rat stuck its head into the fruit and hollowed
it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I did what they told us to do, set a snap trap in the attic," John
Savoy said. "My wife heard scratching and gnawing, which is not pleasant,
I can tell you. Then one night, SNAP! I knew we'd got one."</TE>
<TE>   Savoy's son-in-law was dispatched to remove the rat. Poison was set
out. Then the homeowner's nightmare: a poisoned rat fell between the
walls of the Savoy's pantry.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Savoy's face twists into a mask of horror as she tells the
story.</TE>
<TE>   "Smell? Oh my . . .," she said. "It was a dead rat for Pete's sake."</TE>

<HD>Honolulu Citizens Get Serious About City Hall Transgressions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN ESSOYAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>Politicians seldom get much respect, but the ones at Honolulu City
Hall seem to be losing what little is left--with the mayor and nearly
half of the City Council recently landing in trouble with the law, and
one former councilman in prison.</LD>
<LD>   "It's disgraceful and it's embarrassing," said voter Carol Hanna after
testifying in favor of an ethics bill at City Hall. "We can't afford to
have the reputation of the most corrupt city council in America. We've
got to take positive steps to clean it up."</LD>
<LD>   When their elected officials began tripping up, Honolulu voters at
first seemed to shrug it off. Efforts to recall two council members
fizzled last year for lack of signatures.</LD>
<TE>   But the situation has spiraled to the point where it's hard to ignore.
The politicians' problems are fueling a push for campaign finance reform
and ethics bills at the state Legislature and City Hall. A drive to
impeach one councilwoman has reached the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone from one council member to the next and, all of a sudden,
the council's become a laughingstock," said Council Chairman John DeSoto,
who just took the leadership reins from a wayward member.</TE>
<TE>   Its reputation notwithstanding, the nine-member council has a serious
responsibility: stewardship of the island of Oahu, which makes up both
the city and county of Honolulu, and its $1-billion operating budget.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a rundown on the troubles at Honolulu Hale (pronounced
"ha-leh"), the red-roofed, Spanish Mission-style seat of local
government.</TE>
<TE>   * Mayor Jeremy Harris, a top contender in this year's governor's race,
is facing an investigation by the city prosecutor of his mayoral
campaign's fund-raising activities. The state Campaign Spending
Commission contends that the campaign accepted contributions beyond legal
limits and attributed donations to people who didn't make them--even
children. Harris says he's confident his campaign will be exonerated.</TE>
<TE>   * Councilman Jon Yoshimura was forced to step down as chairman last
month when a state disciplinary board recommended he be suspended from
practicing law for six months for lying about a hit-and-run accident. He
hit a parked car in 1999 and fled the scene, then repeatedly denied that
he had been drinking. He was also fined last year for improperly using
campaign funds.</TE>
<TE>   The setbacks aren't limiting his career goals: Yoshimura plans to run
for lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Councilman Andrew Mirikitani began a four-year prison term in
January for taking kickbacks from his staff in exchange for salary
bonuses. He was convicted last July of federal felony corruption charges,
including theft, bribery and extortion, but refused to step down from the
City Council until just before he was sentenced in December.</TE>
<TE>   His colleagues stripped him of his committee positions, but couldn't
force him from office. The case prompted a bill in the state Legislature
that would oust politicians immediately upon conviction of a crime,
rather than at sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   * Councilwoman Rene Mansho is under investigation by the city
prosecutor's office for malfeasance, and her constituents have filed a
petition with the state Supreme Court seeking her impeachment. The former
schoolteacher acknowledged last year that her council staff habitually
handled her campaign fund-raising on city time, with city property. She
had also used campaign funds for travel, then was reimbursed by the city
for the same expenses. She paid $80,000 to the city and state in fines
and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   * Councilman John Henry Felix is racking up daily fines for holding
weddings for pay at his home, mostly for Japanese tourists. He was cited
for violating the city's zoning ordinance governing "home occupations,"
and the Zoning Board of Appeals recently upheld the citation. Felix is
appealing his case to the Circuit Court. Council members are paid $43,000
annually, and most have other sources of income.</TE>
<TE>   Even Councilman Steve Holmes, who has championed ethics in government,
found himself in an awkward position a couple of years ago when the
university he claimed to have a degree from said it had no such record.</TE>
<TE>   "City Hall? It's a mess!" said Yasumasa Kuroda, political science
professor at the University of Hawaii. "Just about everyone seems to have
some sort of problem, not necessarily serious crimes, but something
ethically wrong or at least questionable. . . . There appears to have
been a culture of doing whatever they can get away with."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its internal problems, the City Council has resolved some
issues in the last few months. It voted to ban smoking in Honolulu's
restaurants effective July 1; to purchase 1,875-acre Waimea Valley, a
botanical and cultural treasure on the North Shore; and to condemn land
for private redevelopment in Waikiki.</TE>
<TE>   The council members' troubles may simply reflect greater vigilance on
the part of authorities. In the last several years, under Executive
Director Robert Watada, the state Campaign Spending Commission has
stepped up enforcement, investigating numerous politicians and companies
that may be involved in illegal political donations.</TE>
<TE>   State legislators have been collared along with city officials. Former
state Sen. Marshall Ige is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in
January to felony theft--for collecting rent on land he didn't own--and
tax evasion charges. He lost his seat in the 2000 primary after he was
charged with campaign spending violations, and was convicted shortly
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii officials seem eager to polish their image before this fall's
elections. Bills getting a favorable hearing at the Legislature include
campaign finance reform, the recall of lawmakers, mandatory ethics
training for officials and the immediate ouster of any politician
convicted of a crime. The City Council is considering a bill to
strengthen enforcement of ethics laws and limit gifts to officeholders.
Last year, it passed legislation requiring ethics training for all city
managers, council members and their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think incumbents realize that in order to get reelected, it will be
important for both the City Council and the state Legislature to sort of
clean house," Kuroda said.</TE>
<TE>   Voters will have a chance to make sweeping changes this fall. Because
of redistricting, with the governor's race, elections will be held for
every state legislative seat. All nine seats on the Honolulu City Council
are also up for election, and six incumbents--including those in
trouble--must step down because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether Hawaii residents will rise up and take action.
The state's voter turnout, declining for years, dropped to the lowest in
the country in the November 2000 elections, according to a U.S. Census
Bureau report issued last month. Just 44% of Hawaii residents eligible to
vote did so, compared to a national average of 60%. Voter apathy here is
attributed partly to lack of competition in many races, but also may
reflect growing disenchantment.</TE>

<HD>Egan Defends Stance on Priest Complaints</HD>
<DH>Church: New York cardinal says he began a policy on claims against
clergy when he was a Connecticut bishop.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic Cardinal Edward Egan insisted Saturday that he
properly handled allegations of sexual abuse by priests when he was a
bishop in Connecticut. He also urged that all allegations of sexual abuse
be immediately given to police.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter prepared for distribution this weekend to all parishioners
in the Archdiocese of New York, the nation's third-largest archdiocese,
Egan for the first time answered charges made about his conduct when he
was bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   "Should any priest sexually abuse a child, he will be removed from
pastoral ministry," Egan wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The Hartford (Conn.) Courant reported last week that it had uncovered
sealed court documents indicating Egan failed to aggressively investigate
some abuse allegations and did not refer complaints to criminal
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Egan said he instituted a policy in Bridgeport that
"any clergy accused of sexual misconduct with a minor was, after
preliminary diocesan investigation, to be sent immediately to one of the
most prominent psychiatric institutions in the nation for evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "If the conclusions were favorable, he was returned to the
ministry, in some cases with restrictions, so as to be doubly careful. If
they were not favorable, he was not allowed to function as a priest."</TE>
<TE>   Egan did not specify the number of priests evaluated or disclose the
results of any diocesan investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bridgeport diocese settled complaints against six priests for an
undisclosed amount in March 2001, shortly after Egan was appointed to the
Archdiocese of New York. Egan served in Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000. He
said the cases the Courant cited occurred before he was named bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Egan wrote in the letter Saturday that if the Archdiocese of New York
receives an allegation of sexual abuse, "we will make the appropriate
report to the proper authorities if there is reasonable cause to suspect
abuse and the victim does not oppose the reporting.</TE>
<TE>   "I would strongly encourage, however, anyone who has an allegation of
sexual abuse to bring it to the proper civil authorities directly and
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Today, some of the nation's other leading archbishops planned to have
priests read messages addressing the child-molestation scandal. Pope John
Paul II on Thursday broke his silence on the matter, saying the "grave
scandal" was casting a "dark shadow of suspicion" over all priests.</TE>
<TE>   Some worshipers leaving Saturday evening Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in midtown Manhattan said they doubted the sincerity of the
letter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how true any of this is. You want to believe it, but I
don't know what to believe at this point," said Angelina Zito, 35. "I'm a
Roman Catholic, and I feel bad not taking their word for it, but I don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the New York Times reported that when Brooklyn Bishop
Thomas Daily was the second-highest official in the Archdiocese of
Boston, he sought to avoid a scandal rather than investigate priests
accused of molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Daily has emerged as a key figure in the case of defrocked priest John
Geoghan, who has been accused of molesting more than 130 children. Daily
said Friday he regretted some decisions he made during his tenure in
Boston, from 1973 to 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper cited court documents stating that in 1982, when Daily
was a chancellor in the Archdiocese of Boston, he was told of allegations
that Geoghan abused seven boys, ages 6 to 14.</TE>
<TE>   Daily said he may have encouraged the family to keep quiet about
allegations. He didn't tell authorities about Geoghan, and when he
transferred him to another parish, he said, he did not recall telling
about the complaints against him.</TE>

<HD>Fla. AFL-CIO Endorses McBride for Governor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Florida's AFL-CIO endorsed a Tampa lawyer Saturday over former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in the race for the Democratic nomination to unseat
Gov. Jeb Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Bill McBride was chosen over Reno, Miami state Sen. Daryl Jones and
Miami political activist Bob Kunst, who made their pitches Saturday to
the union's executive committee behind closed doors.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a fantastic endorsement," McBride said. "It will give me an
army of supporters."</LD>
<TE>   The committee's recommendation was approved by more than 80% of about
250 representatives of several AFL-CIO member unions.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Lois Frankel, who was ill, was the only
gubernatorial candidate unable to make the meeting, said Rich Templin,
the union's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The endorsement of the 500,000-member union is viewed as an important
step toward winning the Democratic Party nomination.</TE>
<TE>   After the announcement, labor members began chanting, "It's time for
Jeb to go!"</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will help McBride with name recognition," said Cindy Hall,
president of the Florida AFL-CIO. "Hopefully, Bill McBride will go ahead
in the polls. It will help him in collecting money."</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Harburger, a Reno spokeswoman, said after the vote that Reno
still expects to win the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "We will work with rank and file and labor leadership to win," said
Harburger, noting that Reno already has received an endorsement from the
plumbers' union.</TE>
<TE>   Kunst said he told the committee that he did not want their
endorsement. He told the labor officials that both they and the
Democratic Party had become too passive.</TE>
<TE>   Jones did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Ex-President Carter Plans Cuba Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Former President Carter will visit Cuba this year, provided the
Bush administration doesn't stand in his way, a Carter spokeswoman
confirmed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The move would make Carter the first former American president to
visit the island since Fidel Castro took power in 1959.</LD>
<LD>   "He was issued a formal invitation by Fidel Castro, but he doesn't
know yet when he's going," Kay Torrance, of the Carter Center in Atlanta,
said Saturday. "He doesn't have an agenda planned at this time. He's just
looking forward to the visit."</LD>
<TE>   Carter told CNN on Friday that the Bush administration probably
wouldn't prevent the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect to get their tacit approval, not their blessing," Carter
said. "We can't go, obviously, without the permission of the government.
My understanding is that they will give that approval."</TE>
<TE>   Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said Castro's invitation stemmed
from the Carter Center's Americas Program, an effort to bring together
leaders of the Cuban American exile community and the Castro government.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Garcia, executive director of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told the Miami Herald his organization welcomes the
trip--provided Carter tells Castro to step down. During a 1994 visit to
Haiti, Carter negotiated an agreement to remove military ruler Gen. Raoul
Cedras from power.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is going the way he went to Haiti, then we welcome his trip to
Cuba if he is going to tell Fidel Castro to leave," Garcia said.
"However, if he's going to give legitimacy to a 43-year-old dictatorship,
then I think it would be unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   While not divulging his agenda, Carter said his intentions are to
improve relations between Cuba and the United States, not to deliver an
ultimatum.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said increasing trade and Americans' visits to Cuba would
spread understanding of the advantages of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best way to bring about change," he said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Pulls Out of Deal With Ovitz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal has halted financing of a joint film production
venture it had with a unit of Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group,
the companies jointly announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Vivendi will pay AMG's Artists Production Group
a "substantial amount of money" but will stop providing it with overhead
and development financing, said Michael Burns, a spokesman for Artists
Management Group.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal has been negotiating for weeks to end the
relationship with APG, sources told The Times.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi has plans to shutter its StudioCanal USA unit, which struck a
deal with the Artists Production Group in 2000 to cover overhead and
costs incurred in developing films--about $8 million a year for three
years.</TE>
<TE>   With StudioCanal, APG has developed 17 films. None has been put into
production.</TE>
<TE>   Paris-based Vivendi will retain a financial interest in those nascent
projects, but Artists Production Group will assume control of them as it
seeks new funding and distribution partners, Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group has four other projects it previously removed from
the umbrella of the partnership and moved to other studios to keep the
projects alive.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal also plans to close its Universal Focus unit. The
closures are part of a plan to consolidate its specialty film divisions
once its purchase of the entertainment assets of Barry Diller's USA
Networks is completed. Diller's film unit, USA Films, is expected to
emerge as the sole specialty film unit for Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is a setback to Ovitz and his Artist Management Group,
which has suffered hits to its television unit as well as the departure
of some executives.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz co-founded Creative Artists Agency before leaving to become
president of the Walt Disney Co. in 1995. He left Disney in a highly
publicized fallout that garnered him $38 million in cash and roughly $100
million in company shares, and began Artists Management Group three years
ago.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>A man and woman were indicted on charges they tried to hire a hit
man to kill a federal prosecutor, a federal judge and a witness, all of
whom were involved in a check fraud case against them.</LD>
<LD>   Arnold Wesley Flowers and Sompong Khamsomphou were each charged with
conspiracy to kill a federal officer, conspiracy to kill a witness to
prevent testimony and conspiracy to commit murder for hire.</LD>
<LD>   Flowers and Khamsomphou were in custody in state holding facilities
Saturday, and corrections officials said they were unavailable for
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's indictment superseded an indictment returned last month that
said Flowers and Khamsomphou teamed on a fraud scheme involving
counterfeit bank checks.</TE>
<TE>   The initial indictment said Khamsomphou obtained customer information
at a Minnesota branch of Wells Fargo Bank where she worked and gave it to
Flowers to turn into fake checks totaling more than $40,000, which he
cashed in the Anchorage area.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor, the presiding judge and a witness in that case were
named in the latest indictment as targets in the murder-for-hire plot. A
fourth person also was named as a target, but the indictment did not
specify a connection.</TE>

<HD>IRS Chides U.S. Agencies Over Tax Delinquents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal employees and retirees owe more than $2.5 billion in back
taxes but actually are more conscientious taxpayers than Americans
overall, the Internal Revenue Service says.</LD>
<LD>   As of October, just more than 2.8% of federal employees and retirees,
or about 244,000 people, had balances due on past income taxes but had
not agreed to an installment plan with the IRS.</LD>
<LD>   For the population as a whole, it was 5.2%. Still, IRS Commissioner
Charles Rossotti says tax delinquency at any level by federal workers is
cause for concern.</LD>
<TE>   "If the public perceives that federal employees do not maintain the
highest level of tax compliance, public confidence in government will
suffer," Rossotti said in a letter to federal agency heads, detailing
each department's noncompliance rate.</TE>
<TE>   The data, compiled by the IRS annually since 1993 and to be released
this week, include Congress, the White House, Cabinet departments, courts
and independent agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 381,500 federal employees or retirees out of almost 8.7
million were behind on their taxes. About 11.5 million of an estimated
177.5 million taxpayers nationwide owed $28.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those totals included about 2.3 million taxpayers who were paying off
$8.6 billion in taxes through monthly installment agreements. About
137,000 federal employees were paying off $608.6 million that way.</TE>
<TE>   It is the noncompliance rate that draws the most scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, the House had a noncompliance rate of more than 4%,
compared with almost 3.5% for the Senate. The rates include members of
Congress and their staffs. The Executive Office of the President had a
noncompliance rate of 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The Education Department and Department of Housing and Urban
Development each were over 4%, the highest among Cabinet agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department had by far the biggest outstanding tax bill at
$205.6 million. More than 110,000 retired military personnel owed more
than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department, which includes the IRS, had the lowest rate
among Cabinet agencies: 1.5%. Even lower was the FBI, at 1.4%, with 812
individuals owing about $3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The rate for the CIA was not available because its total number of
employees is classified, but the intelligence agency did have 304
individuals who owed more than $2 million. The National Security Agency
had 450 employees owing $2.3 million.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Girls Proudly Take Their Seats in Classroom</HD>
<DH>Education: Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai hails the start of
the school year as a joyful day for his nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After years of being turned away at the schoolhouse gates, girls
marched proudly at the head of the class Saturday at a ceremony here
marking the start of school and the resumption of education for girls as
well as boys in this country freeing itself from the Taliban's grim grip.</LD>
<LD>   "A great day for Afghanistan," declared interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai after being showered with golden confetti by a choir of gaily
dressed female pupils. "Probably today was the happiest day for me
personally here--to see our children go to school and to see them happy."</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, Karzai choked back tears when he spoke of his joy at seeing
the children going to school again in peace after 23 years of war in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Today we cry out of happiness," he said, collecting himself.</TE>
<TE>   It was a race to the finish, but classes opened at 3,000 elementary
schools across Afghanistan for an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million
students. Karzai, UNICEF Director Carol Bellamy and the Aga Khan, a
Muslim leader and philanthropist, all proclaimed it a historic day that
augured well for the future of this war-ravaged land.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the little fresh-faced children, particularly the
girls--some in scout uniforms, some in track suits, some in traditional
folk dress with bright red scarves and golden bangles, and some in black
tunics and white scarves--who stole the show.</TE>
<TE>   They radiated joy and pride as they sang and recited, and left the
ceremony at the Amani High School, not far from the presidential palace,
clutching pouches of U.N.-provided pens and copybooks.</TE>
<TE>   Their crystal voices rang out, in Dari and Pashto, as they sang newly
written songs extolling knowledge and celebrating the departure of the
Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   Many boys as well as girls did not attend school in the Taliban years,
when civil war and poverty combined to erode the quality and availability
of education across the country. By some estimates, Afghanistan has only
a 13% literacy rate.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy pointed out that some courageous teachers continued educating
girls in their homes, and she paid tribute to them as "heroes."</TE>
<TE>   She said the U.N. agency for children had given out 7,700 tons of
school supplies, including 500 classroom tents for places where school
buildings have been destroyed. The United States contributed by printing
4 million textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Among the supplies distributed by UNICEF were hundreds of what the
agency calls a "school in a box"--a metal chest containing all the
supplies that a teacher would need for 80 elementary-level pupils, down
to blunt-end scissors and a plastic clock to teach time.</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledged that many schools remain in abysmal condition,
lacking desks and chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of work to do in that area," Karzai said. "But
education will not wait for that--education will go on."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was determined to make education the largest item in the
country's budget and to ensure that teachers are well paid.</TE>
<TE>   At Sharino High School in western Kabul, Spanish peacekeeping troops
were still painting the school as pupils in their finest clothing entered
through the iron gates for their first official day.</TE>
<TE>   "We will try to be the leaders of our country, to rehabilitate it,"
promised Parwin Rasouli, the school's female principal.</TE>
<TE>   Some girls had been taking special catch-up classes over the last few
months to try to make up for the six years since the Taliban seized
control of most of Afghanistan. The regime barred girls from attending
classes and punished people found teaching girls.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sharino school, which now has coeducational classes up to the
sixth grade and holds all-girls classes for grades 7 to 12, one of the

<HD>American Doctor's Mission Keeps Calling Him Back to Kabul</HD>
<DH>Asia: G. Gordon Hadley has managed to adapt to Afghanistan's
changing political tides in his quest to train budding physicians in the
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>His life is a sweep of recent Afghan history.</LD>
<LD>   Episodically over four decades, as this country's politics staggered
from monarchy to communism to warlordism to religious extremism,
California pathologist G. Gordon Hadley has dedicated himself to teaching
young medical students in the troubled land.</LD>
<LD>   Now 80, both Hadley and his resiliently cheerful wife, Alphie, who
sometimes serves as his lab assistant, are back again. They're here to
help rebuild the Kabul Medical Institute, where the doctor first taught
in 1960 at the start of many tours in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Few Americans can claim such a positive influence on this society. A
prominent Afghan physician compares Hadley to Dr. Albert Schweitzer.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't care about politics," said Dr. Sayed Alef Shah Ghanzanfar,
a former lecturer at Harvard University who is one of Hadley's many
admirers here. "Like Albert Schweitzer, he is dedicated to the human
cause. He feels that the field of medicine can survive under any
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Conditions in Kabul, where fourth-year medical students do not even
have access to microscopes and entire neighborhoods have been razed by
years of conflict, could hardly be worse.</TE>
<TE>   Once Afghanistan's premier medical college, the institute sits on the
western edge of this capital that was devastated by 1993-96 battles
between rival warlords.</TE>
<TE>   During the fundamentalist Taliban regime, the institute was regularly
raided by religious police, who banned women from the campus and slapped
male students around when beards or haircuts did not conform to Taliban
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly undaunted by shifting politics, the Hadleys survived it all,
even the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I did get upset when they slapped my students," Hadley remarked
mildly.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley said he felt just as comfortable under the Taliban as he did
under Afghanistan's monarch, Mohammad Zaher Shah, who first invited him
to work here 42 years ago. At no time did he feel any danger, Hadley
said. "I always say I feel safest between two Afghan friends."</TE>
<TE>   Deposed in 1973 and living in exile in Rome since then, Zaher Shah is
scheduled to return to his country this month. The Hadleys will be here.</TE>
<TE>   The Hadleys are Seventh-day Adventists. The doctor is a 1943 graduate
of the church's medical school at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda,
Calif., where he served as dean. The couple maintain a home near the
university.</TE>
<TE>   They represent a long-standing tradition of overseas volunteer medical
service by their church that dates to the 19th century American Medical
Missionary College in Battle Creek, Mich., founded by cereal magnate John
Harvey Kellogg. Loma Linda, which opened in 1905, is the successor to
that school.</TE>
<TE>Missionaries Who Place an Emphasis on Service</TE>
<TE>   Over the last century, the Adventists have sent thousands of trained
physicians around the world, from China to the remotest regions of
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But strictly speaking they are not missionaries for their faith,
instead emphasizing public service over preaching the Gospel. "If a
person asks us what we believe, we tell them," said Alphie Hadley, "but
we don't sit down and give them Bible studies."</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Hadley is a religious person," said Ghanzanfar, an author and one
of Afghanistan's most respected medical educators. But "he has never been
thought of as a missionary. . . . With his deeds he is a missionary of
ethics and proper behavior that is necessary for a medical practice."</TE>
<TE>   Ghanzanfar mentioned a recent incident in which Hadley--frustrated by
the lack of resources at the institute--reached into his own pocket to
pay for solvents used in treating tissue samples. Students at the Kabul
school, although challenged by Hadley's rigorous examinations, clearly
adore him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is the best teacher at the school," said fourth-year
student Fraidoon Afzali, who hopes to become a surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley, who speaks passable Dari, the local language, insists that
instruction be in English. "To be good doctors, the students need to be
functional in a scientific language," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hadleys first came here in 1960 after a stint in India. They
arrived a few months after the young king had shocked Afghan society by
appearing in public with his unveiled wife. The act was a signal to the
rigid Afghan society.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after that, young Afghan women, emboldened by the symbolic
gesture, began attending Hadley's pathology course. In fact, the doctor
had created the pathology department and laboratory at the institute.</TE>
<TE>   "One day the girls just started coming to class," Hadley recalled. "At
first they sat together in clumps. Then if the class was crowded and
there were no other seats they would sit among the boys."</TE>
<TE>   One of the women who attended that first class was Suhaila Seddiqi,
now Afghanistan's minister of public health. In fact, the school is
terribly overcrowded today mainly because the 500 women banned by the
Taliban from attending are back.</TE>
<TE>   After returning home so that Hadley could take a job at Los Angeles
County Hospital, the couple were back in Afghanistan from 1963 to 1964,
during which Zaher Shah asked for help setting up a medical school in the
eastern city of Jalalabad. Hadley was back again from 1970 to 1973. He
left after the king was deposed in a coup.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Afghanistan had gotten into Hadley's blood.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always liked this place. When I'm not here I miss it terribly,"
Hadley said. "I tell my friends here I'm neem Afghan--half Afghan."</TE>
<TE>   He did little work here during the years of Communist rule. But when
the Najibullah regime was overthrown in 1992, two of the new warlord
rulers, Ismail Khan in the western city of Herat and Haji Abdul Qadir in
Jalalabad, asked him to return and help their provincial medical
education programs.</TE>
<TE>Physician Strikes a Deal with the Taliban</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 to 1999, Hadley, funded by a grant from Hong Kong movie
mogul Run Run Shaw, headed a new medical education program in Hangzhou,
China.</TE>
<TE>   But the Taliban regime, desperate to revive its flagging medical
school, asked him to return to Kabul in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley agreed to return to Kabul under certain conditions, to which
the Taliban agreed: teaching would be in English; medical supplies would
be imported duty-free; Alphie Hadley could dress in Western style and
drive a car; and, in keeping with the Adventist practice, he would have
Saturdays off.</TE>
<TE>   With a grant of several hundred thousand dollars and sponsorship by
Loma Linda University, Hadley set about rebuilding the institute,
starting with a well-stocked library and several rehabilitated lecture
halls.</TE>
<TE>   Though Americans were generally reviled during the Taliban period, the
theocratic government-by-mullah left Hadley alone to educate. "I thought
they were nice guys," said the contagiously optimistic Alphie Hadley,
"but of course we never tangled with them."</TE>
<TE>   The Hadleys were home in Loma Linda on summer vacation last year when
the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. When the American bombing campaign in
Afghanistan began Oct. 7, his concern was for the safety of his students.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed for my friends, and I prayed for my students," the doctor
said. "These medical students weren't interested in the politics."</TE>
<TE>   To Hadley, the son of an Adventist doctor who ran an inner-city clinic
in Washington, each student is a potential healer and educator.</TE>
<TE>   Hadley comes from a generation that memorized poetry. In a recent
conversation, he said he draws inspiration for his work from the 18th
century poem "Elegy Written in a Country Courtyard" by Thomas Gray.</TE>
<TE>   One of the central themes is unrealized human potential, speaking of
the common folk in an English country town whose poverty and lack of
opportunity held them back.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the small living room of his Kabul apartment, Hadley
recited from memory his favorite verse:</TE>
<TE>   Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</TE>
<TE>   The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:</TE>
<TE>   Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen</TE>
<TE>   And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Opposition Rally Scuttled, Leaders Arrested</HD>
<DH>Asia: Police stop protest in Lahore. Big gatherings have been
banned since the government began a crackdown on extremists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Police in the eastern city of Lahore rounded up dozens of leaders
of the country's main opposition party to block a rally Saturday
demanding the ouster of Pakistan's military ruler.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions soared in the city near the border with India, as police
erected barbed wire barricades and blocked all main roads leading to
Mochi Gate garden, a massive park where the rally was scheduled to be
held. Thousands were expected to attend, but police stopped the rally
from taking place.</LD>
<LD>   Police defended the arrests of members of the Alliance for the
Restoration of Democracy, arguing that a protest would disrupt law and
order in the country.</LD>
<TE>   President Pervez Musharraf's government has refused to permit large
demonstrations since Jan. 12, when Pakistan began cracking down on
Islamic extremists in an effort to cooperate with the United States in
its war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999, has
been holding high-level meetings to muster support for a referendum
reaffirming his rule. The ballot would be held sometime before
parliamentary elections set for October.</TE>
<TE>   There is precedent for such a referendum. Former military dictator
Gen. Zia ul-Haq, who ruled Pakistan for 11 years before his death in a
plane crash in 1988, held a referendum seeking to extend his mandate in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court two years ago ordered Musharraf to hold elections to
restore a democratic government by October 2002. If he bypasses the
election, Musharraf would have to amend the constitution, which requires
that parliament choose a president.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf did not mention the referendum during an address to the
nation over state-run Pakistan Television on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has said he will lift the ban on rallies at some point
before the elections. Alliance leaders insist that the time has come.</TE>
<TE>   "We will defy the ban on rallies," said Misbaur Rehman, a local leader
in Lahore. He was arrested later by police.</TE>
<TE>   Those detained include the top leaders of the alliance, which includes
the parties of former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif,
who was ousted by Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the city of Rawalpindi, just outside the capital,
Islamabad, a key Islamic leader also pledged to defeat Pakistan's secular
government in the next elections.</TE>
<TE>   Qazi Hussain Ahmed, a longtime supporter of Afghanistan's former
Taliban rulers, said he wants to bring Islamic revolution to Pakistan by
forming an alliance with other religious parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf should step down with honor," he said. "Otherwise, the
masses will oust him from power with force as he has handed over the
country's airports and other sensitive installations to the United States
for operations against Islamic elements."</TE>

<HD>Cloak of Silence Covered Abuse at Jesuit Retreat</HD>
<DH>Scandals: Religious order admits two retarded men were victimized.
Talks are underway to settle $10-million suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS GATOS, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Two mentally disabled men who live and work at a Jesuit retreat
were sexually abused by members of the clergy for at least five years,
according to court records and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   In a case that drew no public attention, one of the clergymen, Brother
Charles Leonard Connor, was convicted last year of committing a lewd act
on one victim. He is free after six months of home detention. Another
Jesuit, Father Edward Thomas Burke, admitted to his superior two years
ago that he engaged in sexual misconduct with the other victim, documents
show.</LD>
<LD>   Police reports and internal memos reveal a pattern of warnings
followed by a reluctance on the part of some Jesuit leaders to notify
authorities--much like dozens of other cases of sexual abuse involving
Catholic priests that have surfaced around the country.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Connor, three other Jesuits are registered as sex
offenders in Northern California. All three were convicted in separate
cases involving minors.</TE>
<TE>   Connor and Burke, both 80, are among four Jesuits named as defendants
in a lawsuit charging that the mentally impaired men were subjected to
repeated acts of sodomy, molestation and false imprisonment at Sacred
Heart Jesuit Center. Attorneys representing the California Province of
the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, have been
negotiating a monetary settlement with lawyers for the two victims over
the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas H. Smolich, head of the California Province,
acknowledged that Connor and Burke took advantage of the mentally
disabled men. He said allegations that any other members of the Jesuit
order sexually abused the victims are unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, two men did things they shouldn't have done. We are not
denying that," Smolich said in an interview. "I wish this hadn't
happened. I want to make sure that it never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the California Province, Paul E. Gaspari, added:
"We're not saying sexual misconduct didn't go on. We're saying we didn't
know it was going on."</TE>
<TE>   However, an acquaintance of the victims alerted Jesuit superiors to
possible sexual misconduct at the retreat in 1995. Two years later, Santa
Clara County sheriff's deputies visited the Sacred Heart Jesuit Center
after a nearby shopkeeper, acting on behalf of the victims, made
allegations of molestations.</TE>
<TE>   Jesuit superiors at Sacred Heart relocated Burke in April 2000, after
he admitted having sexual contact with one victim, but they did not
notify authorities. Connor also was removed, but only after a sheriff's
detective threatened to have him arrested. The Jesuit superiors sent
Connor to a residence on the campus of the all-boys Bellarmine College
Preparatory in San Jose without telling school officials that he was
under investigation for sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>    The three other Jesuits who are registered sex offenders also lived
at Sacred Heart in Los Gatos. Their offenses did not occur at the
facility and did not involve the two mentally disabled men. Two clergymen
were convicted in separate felony cases of molesting 7-year-old girls.
The third, an associate pastor at Most Holy Trinity parish in San Jose at
the time of his arrest, was convicted on two counts of oral copulation
with a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the sex crimes by Jesuits and the abuses alleged in the
civil lawsuit have not been disclosed publicly. Unlike many of the cases
involving pedophile priests that have been reported in the media
recently, the abuses at Sacred Heart occurred in the last few years and
the victims are mentally incapacitated adults, who are granted fewer
legal protections than minors.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, the Roman Catholic Church has been grappling with
allegations of sexual misconduct by priests and mounting criticism that
church leaders have been slow to act. To date, individual dioceses in the
U.S. have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of sexual abuse
by Catholic clergy.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits make up the largest religious order in the Catholic
Church. Founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius Loyola, a Basque nobleman, the
Jesuits have more than 21,000 members serving 112 nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuit order is divided into 10 provinces in the U.S. Smolich
oversees 457 Jesuit members in four Western states and Hawaii. His office
is located on the property of Sacred Heart, a picturesque retirement
community for about 65 Jesuits overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Since he was appointed provincial in 1999, Smolich said, he has made
his position on sexual harassment and sex abuse unmistakably clear.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't tolerate it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smolich, 47, who reports directly to the Jesuit superior general in
Rome, said he believes sexual misconduct is not a problem within the
California Province. Aside from the four registered sex offenders, only
two cases of sexual abuse with minors appear in province files in the
last 15 years, he said. They involved inappropriate touching, Smolich
said.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the Jesuits received treatment and are active again in
ministries, although their contact with children is restricted. Smolich
declined to provide names of the offenders or any other details.</TE>
<TE>   Of the seven clergymen convicted of sex crimes or named in the civil
lawsuit, five were previously employed at Jesuit high schools. Smolich
said he is unaware of any prior complaints of sexual misconduct filed
against those clergymen.</TE>
<TE>   Smolich said "mitigating circumstances," such as the advanced ages of
the defendants and the diminished mental capacity of the victims, make it
difficult to determine the precise nature of the sexual abuse alleged in
the lawsuit. "This is hard. It is complicated," Smolich said. "We're
never going to know what really happened. We just aren't."</TE>
<TE>   Connor and Burke both cited their 5th Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination on numerous occasions during depositions taken
recently. They were not made available for comment by the California
Province or their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed June 19, 2001, in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, alleges that the two victims were sexually abused for "as long as
30 years." This claim is based on statements by the victims that the
molestations began within a year of their arrival at Sacred Heart, said
M. Jean Starcevich, the victims' attorney. The plaintiffs are seeking
more than $10 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The two victims at Sacred Heart are referred in court documents as
"John Doe" and "James Doe."</TE>
<TE>   John, 56, was born in San Francisco and contracted polio as a child.
He was raised in foster homes, attended Polytechnic High School in San
Francisco in the early 1960s, and moved to Sacred Heart on Oct. 8, 1969,
at the age of 24.</TE>
<TE>   He has one leg substantially smaller and shorter than the other,
suffers severe back pain as well as arthritis in the hands and recently
underwent a hernia operation. He is a huge Elvis Presley fan and spends
time hand-painting medals to pin on his military shirts.</TE>
<TE>   James, 50, was born in Germany and adopted from an orphanage as a
toddler by a U.S.Air Force officer and his wife. His parents were
divorced when he was 10. He never attended school and spent his teenage
years in a state mental institution. He arrived at Sacred Heart on Aug.
26, 1970, at the age of 19.</TE>
<TE>   He is a railroad buff who enjoys viewing tapes from his collection of
more than 100 train videos. Whenever possible, James will spend hours at
a railroad station watching trains arrive and depart.</TE>
<TE>   Both men have been diagnosed as suffering from mental retardation. At
Sacred Heart, they were employed as dishwashers responsible for cleaning,
drying and storing pots and pans used in preparing meals for the Jesuits.
They were paid a starting salary of $150 per month.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of them being here was charitable," said Gaspari, the
Jesuits' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Before they were placed on paid administrative leave a year ago, John
and James earned about $1,000 per month with expenses deducted for room
and board. They still occupy adjacent rooms on the second floor of a
storage facility, which is separate from the Jesuit residence. The sexual
abuse took place in the victims' rooms, according to statements they made
to a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>Victim's Acquaintance Reported Abuse</TE>
<TE>   The following accounts are drawn from criminal and civil filings,
transcripts of confidential depositions, police reports and internal
Jesuit memos. In addition, more than 50 interviews were conducted with
prosecutors, investigators, members of the Society of Jesus, lawyers,
guardians for the victims and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   The first indications of sexual misconduct were reported to Sacred
Heart in May 1995 by John's financial advisor. According to a sheriff's
report, she had heard rumors from the kitchen staff that Brother Connor
was molesting John. She knew that Connor had taken John on trips and
spent considerable time alone with him. When she asked John about the
rumors, he "became very upset and began to shake" before saying that
Connor had been touching his private parts, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   She reported Connor to Father Greg Aherne, the Jesuit superior at
Sacred Heart at the time. Aherne talked to Connor, who initially denied
the allegations before admitting that "maybe he had done some
inappropriate touching" while giving John massages, Aherne would tell
sheriff's detectives years later. Connor later told detectives that he
began giving John massages in 1985 to ease his back pains.</TE>
<TE>   Aherne ordered Connor to read the California Province policy on sexual
harassment and misconduct, which specifically banned the practice of
Jesuits giving or assisting in massages "because of the liability
involved." Connor also signed a May 4, 1995, letter from Aherne that
ordered him to stay away from John and James. Aherne filed a separate
memo notifying Father John Privett, the California provincial at the time
who lived and worked at Sacred Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Aherne nor Privett alerted law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1997, the Sheriff's Department was notified by Holly Ilse,
a Los Gatos dress shop owner who had befriended both victims, that James
had confided to her that Connor was fondling him. Two uniformed deputies
were dispatched to Sacred Heart to interview John and James. Both men
denied being molested and the case was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, John and James each told investigators that they did not
say anything about the abuses because they had been threatened repeatedly
by Connor not to do so.</TE>
<TE>Another Call Alleges More Abuse</TE>
<TE>   Detectives reopened their investigation in the spring of 2000 after
receiving another call from Ilse alleging more abuse. Since she first
heard reports of molestation in 1997, Ilse, 36, the only daughter of a
retired San Jose police lieutenant, had badgered investigators and county
protective services workers on the victims'behalf. At Ilse's request, the
Sheriff's Department sent a female plainclothes detective to interview
John at the dress shop.</TE>
<TE>   John told Det. Dianne L. Camarda that the molestations occurred at
night in his room while he was sleeping and sometimes in the shower.</TE>
<TE>   Camarda arranged to interview James at the dress shop. James initially
recounted one occasion in which Connor gave him a massage and touched his
private area. Camarda wrote that James "seemed very truthful and ashamed
about the incident."</TE>
<TE>   Camarda and a fellow deputy drove up to Sacred Heart and discussed the
allegations with Father Richard Cobb, the superior at the residence at
the time. Cobb told the deputies he was unaware of any previous problems
with Connor and that he preferred that John be moved off the property,
not Connor.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Camarda recalled telling Cobb that Connor had to go:
"You will move him. If you don't, he is going to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Connor was promptly transferred to the Bellarmine Jesuit residence on
the high school campus. "We had to move quickly. Given the circumstances,
we felt it was the best place for Charlie," Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Father William Muller, president of Bellarmine, said he received a
routine telephone call from Cobb's assistant requesting a room for
Connor. The failure to notify anyone at the high school about the reason
for Connor's transfer resulted from "a breakdown in communication,"
Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Connor lived at Bellarmine for a total of five months, two of them
while school was in session. Muller said he was under the impression that
Connor had been on campus for a much shorter period of time. "I'm more
distressed about it now than I was before," Muller said.</TE>
<TE>   Connor was interviewed at Bellarmine by sheriff's detectives on the
morning of April 20, 2000. He proclaimed he had done nothing wrong and
declined to take a polygraph exam.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives returned to Sacred Heart with a search warrant
June 21. They uncovered Aherne's 1995 letters describing Connor's
misconduct and a three-page memo written by Father Cobb on April 21,
2000, detailing his conversations about Connor with other Jesuit
superiors. In his notes, Cobb recounted that Father Burke, the librarian
at Sacred Heart, admitted to having sexual contact with James.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb wrote that Burke told him: "How long has this happened? About
four years--in his room. We always watch train videos. Yes, there has
been some sexual contact in my room. Last sexual contact, three weeks
ago, in his [James'] room."</TE>
<TE>   Burke also told Cobb that he knew about Connor's sexual misconduct
with both victims. "He told me that [John and James] had confided in him
that Charlie Connor had in fact been touching them sexually for some
time."</TE>
<TE>   Cobb, in a sworn deposition, said that he went upstairs to the
provincial's office and told a top assistant to Smolich, "We got a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   No one at Sacred Heart notified authorities about Burke's statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits have no obligation under California law to disclose the
information, said Gaspari, the Jesuits' lawyer. "We are not mandated
reporters because these two individuals are not minors."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did anyone attempt to inform guardians of the two victims. Within
hours, Cobb drove Burke to the Jesuit community at Santa Clara
University, where he lives today.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to implicating Connor, Cobb's memo led sheriff's
detectives to look at Burke as a possible suspect.</TE>
<TE>   On July 11, 2000, Sgt. Lawrence Goodman and Camarda went to Sacred
Heart to interview Burke. A receptionist told them that Burke was
seriously ill and staying with family for an indefinite time, according
to a sheriff's report.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Goodman and Camarda said, they decided to seek a warrant
for Connor's arrest and did not pursue Burke any further due to a lack of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuits have no record of Burke becoming seriously ill or taking a
sick leave after he was transferred to the Jesuit residence. Smolich said
no deliberate attempt was made to hide Burke from authorities.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 17, 2001, Connor pleaded no contest to one felony count of
committing lewd acts on a dependent adult. He was sentenced to wear an
electronic monitoring device for six months, ordered to register as a
lifetime sex offender and forbidden to have any contact with mentally
disabled adults or minors. Connor completed his sentence Nov. 1 and is
living at a Jesuit residence in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor and investigators said they were satisfied with the
outcome because it is difficult in sex cases involving mentally disabled
victims to secure a conviction in a jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence infuriated Ilse, John's court-appointed guardian in the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "How can an old priest in Boston get nine years for touching a boy in
a swimming pool and Connor get no jail time for molesting his victims for
years?" Ilse asked. She was referring to the sentence in January given to
Father John J. Geoghan Jr., 66, who also is accused of molesting more
than 130 children over three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of Connor's sentencing, Ilse and James' sister, Debra
Sullivan, hired three San Jose lawyers to file a civil lawsuit on behalf
of the victims. The attorneys began gathering information and obtained
the Cobb memo from the Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>Disclosures a Shock to James' Sister</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she was devastated when she learned about Burke's
admission of sexual misconduct with her brother. She and James had become
close to Burke, taking him on out-of-town trips and drives in the country
to see old barns. Sullivan said Burke spent hours and hours in her
brother's room watching train videos with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a terrible, terrible betrayal," she said. "This is so
horrendous, so evil and so corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Smolich said he regrets that Sullivan was never informed by Jesuits.
"What happened to [James] shouldn't have happened. It wasn't fair to
[James]. It wasn't fair to Debra. We are doing what we can to make it
right."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she reluctantly held off filing a criminal complaint
against Burke until the civil lawsuit is resolved on the advice of her
attorney. "I want to see Burke in jail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A short time after learning about the Cobb memo, Sullivan said, she
sat down with her brother to discuss the molestations. According to
Sullivan's sworn deposition, James identified six Jesuits at Sacred Heart
who sexually abused him: Burke, Connor, two other brothers named in the
lawsuit, a "Brother Moniz" and a man named "Angel."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she recognized four of the names from her frequent
visits to Sacred Heart over the past two decades. But she had never heard
of Moniz or anyone named "Angel."</TE>
<TE>Others Registered as Sex Offenders</TE>
<TE>   Brother John Rodrigues Moniz, 80, and Father Angel Mariano, 46, are
registered sex offenders who were convicted of felony sex crimes with
minors. Both lived at Sacred Heart in recent years. Neither man has been
accused in criminal or civil courts of molesting John or James.</TE>
<TE>   Moniz was convicted in 1995 after pleading no contest to one felony
count of lewd conduct with a minor for fondling a 7-year-old girl in Los
Gatos. He was placed on three years' probation, ordered to have no
contact with children and required to pay his victim's uninsured medical
expenses and psychological treatment. He now lives at Vianney Renewal
Center in Dittmer, Mo., a facility that treats sex offenders run by
Paraclete priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was arrested about midnight Sept. 21, 1998, in Campbell,
Calif., near San Jose when a police officer caught him in a sex act with
a 17-year-old student in a parked car. According to police reports,
Mariano arranged to meet two teenagers by posing as a 25-year-old woman
on an Internet chat room. He wore lipstick and rouge when he met the
boys.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was convicted March 16, 1999, on two felony counts of oral
copulation with a minor and spent about five months in Santa Clara County
Jail. At the time of his arrest, Mariano served as an associate pastor
for four years at Most Holy Trinity Church in San Jose, one of 13
parishes that are staffed by Jesuits within the province.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano was removed without any explanation. Asked why parishioners at
Holy Trinity were not made aware of the reasons for Mariano's departure,
Smolich said: "Why should they? This is an Internet cruising thing. This
is anonymous sex. This doesn't involve people at the parish. It wasn't a
priest thing. He wasn't dressed in a collar."</TE>
<TE>   Before he was ordained, Mariano taught at Bellarmine from 1988 to
1991. Since his arrest, Mariano lived at Sacred Heart off and on for
about four months.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of two mentally disabled victims of sexual abuse at
Sacred Heart was "never a consideration" when Mariano was assigned to
live there, Smolich said. "He needed a place to come back to. The issues
around Father Mariano's situation have nothing to do with mentally
disabled adults," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano had virtually no contact of any kind with either victim at
Sacred Heart, Smolich said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano is living under the supervision of Smolich and his top
assistant, Father Tony Sholander, at their residence near Santa Clara
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, his opportunities for ministry in the future are circumspect
at best," Smolich said. "I'm not going to assign him somewhere where he
has any contact with minors. I can't and I won't."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth registered sex offender, Father James Thomas Monaghan, was
convicted in 1992 of felony lewd conduct for fondling a 7-year-old girl
who was brought to him for counseling while he was pastor of St. Ignatius
parish in Sacramento. Monaghan, 87, is now in the infirmary at Sacred
Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Because Jesuits are required take a vow of poverty, they are not
forced out of the ministry when they encounter legal problems, Smolich
said. Recently, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese
dismissed about a half dozen priests who previously had engaged in sexual
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Diocesan priests have retirement accounts," Smolich said. "They can
leave and take care of themselves. Men who have spent their lives in the
Jesuit order have nothing. We are not in a position to throw them out. I
wouldn't do it."</TE>
