<HD>The new definition of arm candy</HD>
<DH>The oversized Panerai watch, originally made for the
Italian navy, is being sought and worn by many stylish men.</DH>

<LD>The diners at a round table in the epicenter of Spago's roofless
front courtyard emit a power buzz that surrounds them like a force
field. An actor, an agent, two managers and a pair of European
businessmen, they have gathered for an unusual sort of boys' night
out. After dinner, they will not attend a sporting event together, or
drop in at a strip club. Late into the evening, they will compare
notes on their shared obsession with a particular brand of
wristwatch.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to cliche, a Y chromosome and the shopping gene are not
entirely incompatible. In the last three or four years, a growing
legion of successful American men who had previously restricted their
discretionary purchases to hot cars and electronic toys have become
collectors of Panerai watches.</LD>
<LD>   Their Panerai passion is epic. Manager Jeff Wald, who has four
models and has his eye on two more, says, "I don't know anyone who
has just one. If you have one, you have five or six." The
round-faced, oversized Panerai has supplanted, in spirit, if not in
numbers, the Rolex, Cartier, Piaget and every other pricey timepiece
that seeks to claim status-conscious buyers.</LD>
<TE>   The Panerai's rapid rise is a triumph of classic design, marketing
strategy and serendipity. Officine Panerai was founded in 1860 in
Florence, Italy, and its only customer for most of the 20th century
was the Italian navy, for which it made precision instruments and
underwater watches. Only 300 diving watches were produced between
1938 and 1993, when the company began selling to the public. By the
time it ceased being a military secret, the Panerai -- big, handsome
and unmistakably macho -- had provenance, obvious utility and
exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   None of this was lost on the Richemont Group, a luxury-goods
conglomerate that bought the brand in 1997. It had already been
demonstrated that if Helen of Troy were a watch, she'd be the
Panerai: One look and men had to have her. Sylvester Stallone, for
example, was smitten in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   At the dinner table at Spago, talk of the incredible lightness of
titanium models, limited editions and interchangeable bands ceases as
Angelo Bonati, the Milan-based Panerai chief executive, tells the
story. Stallone was in Rome in 1995, shooting the action-adventure
"Daylight." He bought himself a Panerai, then asked the company to
produce a limited edition of 200 called the Slytech, featuring his
signature engraved on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Wald knows just how Stallone felt when he wanted a Panerai, then
200 more. The agent had lunch with his old friend after the actor
returned from Italy. "I couldn't find the watch here, so when I was
in London, I went to the biggest watch store in town," he recalls.
"They said there was a 6-month waiting list. For me, instant
gratification takes too long, so I had my office search for one till
they found it. I wasn't going to wait."</TE>
<TE>   Not all Panerai roads trace back to Stallone. The source of the
cachet the watch has acquired is difficult to pinpoint. Franck
Verhaeghe, who did not attend the Spago dinner but styles the hair of
a select group of men and women at the Joseph Martin salon on Rodeo
Drive, asks, "Is there like a memo that goes around that says, 'If
you're in the know, this is the watch you should wear now?' I was at
the Four Seasons Hotel in Milan about three years ago, and every man
there was wearing blue jeans, a blue Oxford shirt and that watch.
Then I came back to L.A. and a few months later I started seeing them
here." Richard David Story, editor in chief of Departures, a magazine
sent to American Express platinum card-holders, had a similar
European experience. "About two years ago in Florence, I noticed that
all the heads of the Italian fashion companies were wearing
Panerais," he says. "Then I went to Courcheval, in France, for a ski
story, and started noticing the watches there, on people and in all
the best jewelry stores. It projected an image of Panerai,
International Watch of Mystery. Since then, it has just exploded.
It's the Swatch of the upper class."</TE>
<TE>   New Panerais sell for $2,500 to $25,000. "It isn't a Timex," Wald
says. "But it isn't the most expensive watch you can buy. There's a
reverse snobbery to it."</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of Shenzen, a Chinese village about 40 minutes
outside Hong Kong, faux Panerai watches are ubiquitous. "You can
always tell which luxury goods are hot by seeing what's selling in
Shenzen," says Laura Wenke, senior vice president of Lane Crawford,
Hong Kong's most elegant specialty store. "I went there recently to
do some reconnaissance. You could get the Cartier styles that have
only been out for five minutes, and Panerai knockoffs for $30."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Sher, a William Morris agent and vice president who bought
his first Panerai three years ago, has found that the watch is an
instant conversation piece, and anyone wearing one becomes a member
of a brotherhood. He met Philippe Bonay, president of Panerai, North
America, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. "I was there for a business
meeting and noticed four people sitting together, all wearing Panerai
watches. So I went up to Philippe and we just started talking. You
notice the watch because it's distinctive and large, but it isn't
flashy," he says.</TE>
<TE>   How big is it? From 40 to 47 millimeters in diameter. The Rolex
Daytona, another oversized watch that had its own waiting lists two
years ago, measures 38 millimeters across its face. Although the
Panerai probably wouldn't relish being known as the large-print watch
for presbyopic baby boomers, some owners consider its large,
easy-to-read numbers a benefit. "When I was 45, I had to get reading
glasses, because my arm was too short," Wald says. "I can see my
Panerai without glasses, and it glows in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   Marketers of products as diverse as video games, cars and designer
handbags know that some perverse human quirk intensifies the desire
for anything that seems unattainable. Panerai keeps its production at
half the level of consumer demand, Chief Executive Bonati says. A
limited network of jewelers who handle the watches receive only a few
each, and even the flagship boutique in Florence stocks only 25 to 30
models of the more than 40 styles the company makes.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of L.A.'s most visible Panerai
devotees, and there's a stylistic consistency to his affection for
the watch. After all, he was the civilian who popularized the Hummer,
and Panerais could be seen as the Hummer of male accessories. "Given
what's going on in the world right now, the Panerai's military
background counts for something," Story says. "A wimp can wear one
and it suggests something more than wimpdom."</TE>
<TE>   Chi McBride, the 6-foot-5 actor who plays the high school
principal on "Boston Public," first saw the Panerai on Schwarzenegger
at a cigar bar in Beverly Hills. He rises from the dinner table,
moving away from the detritus of plates of beef, a manly man's entree
that three of the Panerai faithful ordered. In a basso profundo to
rival Barry White's, he says, "This watch. It's got a thinnnnng."</TE>

<DH>At 81, comedian Rodney Dangerfield wants to keep the
laughs, and the movies, coming -- and it's costing him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a large and enviable portion of his adult life, Rodney
Dangerfield has worn a bathrobe and nothing else. By his wife's
estimation, Dangerfield has more than 20 of them, including certain
favorites, and when comedian friends talk about Dangerfield their
anecdotes invariably include the detail that Rodney was backstage or
in his trailer or strolling through a hotel lobby or out on the
street practically naked, except for the robe.</LD>
<LD>   Every now and then, however, Dangerfield gets dressed, and even
less occasionally he gets dressed and leaves his high-rise Westside
condominium. This was the case Tuesday, when the comedian attended
the "premiere" of "The 4th Tenor," his new movie, and celebrated his
81st birthday with a party at Westwood's Napa Valley Grille. There
were a few hundred people on hand, some of whom Dangerfield knew. His
wife, Joan, had arranged the whole thing, and Rodney, in a gesture of
solidarity, wore pants.</LD>
<LD>   "The 4th Tenor" is the sixth in a series of what might be called
the Rodney Dangerfield Movies. They are all post-"Caddyshack,"
post-no-respect, and they all star Dangerfield as either a schnook
with a heart of gold or the crazy rich guy who can party like a rock
star -- including "Easy Money" in 1983 (schnook), "Back to School" in
1986 (crazy rich guy), and "Ladybugs" in 1992 (schnook).</LD>
<TE>   Except the movies have kept coming where others might have
stopped, and so has the joke-writing. For Dangerfield, the yen to
tell the world that he's around, and still getting no respect, hasn't
much abated, even if doctors, and Hollywood, are telling him
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   It was sometime after "Meet Wally Sparks," in 1997, or maybe "My 5
Wives," which came out briefly in 2000, that Dangerfield began having
to finance the Rodney Dangerfield Movies himself.</TE>
<TE>   In "The 4th Tenor," which opens today in one theater in Los
Angeles and one in New York, Dangerfield plays Lupo, the love-struck
proprietor of an Italian restaurant with singing waiters, who falls
in love with his star soprano (played by Annabelle Gurwitch, formerly
of the TBS film series "Dinner and a Movie"). "The 4th Tenor" has no
domestic theatrical distribution, though Warner Bros. bought the
rights to domestic home video, pay-per-view, and video on demand. The
film was co-written and directed by Harry Basil, a comic who has been
opening for Dangerfield on the road for years, and it was produced by
Dangerfield and Joseph Merhi. Merhi is a 48-year-old Lebanese-born
producer who knows his way around selling titles straight to video or
overseas, having produced more than 90 movies, including "Fist of
Honor," "Night of the Wilding" and "Cellblock Sisters: Banished
Behind Bars."</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, as early as this morning, Romania, of all places, they
called and we're closing a deal," Merhi said on the phone last week,
talking about how "The 4th Tenor" was pre-selling and would make back
the roughly $4-million budget. He added that the White House had
inquired about screening the movie on Air Force One, though several
calls to the White House could not confirm this.</TE>
<TE>   Like others, Merhi fell in love with the octogenarian comedian's
gotta-keep-working chutzpah, his "graciousness." They had never met
before Merhi received a call from his tennis partner, Dick Van
Patten.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Van Patten, the actor, called me one day and said he was
speaking to Rodney, and Rodney has a dream of making this movie....
Rodney delivered the script personally to my house."</TE>
<TE>   Van Patten, the accidental broker of "The 4th Tenor," attended the
movie's Westwood premiere and birthday party. He seemed as stunned as
anybody that he'd played a role in getting the film made. He and
Dangerfield weren't social friends, Van Patten said; in fact, they
didn't really speak, but one day Rodney called him, saying that he
knew Van Patten was well-liked around town, and very connected, and
could he find him a producer? Van Patten thought about it for a few
minutes and came up with Joe Merhi.</TE>
<TE>   "Rodney bought me a Chrysler convertible," Van Patten said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do-it-yourself Rodney</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I finance them by myself, mostly," Dangerfield said
earlier this month, sitting on a sofa in his ornately appointed
living room. He was referring to "The 4th Tenor" and "Back by
Midnight," another movie in the can, produced with Merhi, in which
Dangerfield plays a prison warden. "That's why I'm broke,"
Dangerfield joked. "People think I'm dumb. Bums tell me they'll pay
me back." He paused. "It's a funny line, I think, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   He was wearing a robe festooned with playing cards. The robe was
open wide at the chest, displaying the scar from double bypass heart
surgery in 2000. Dangerfield said that if he didn't work he would be
bored out of his mind, and to that end he tried to remember all of
his plugs: the movie, the Web site (www.rodney.com), a new line of
wine, called Rodney's Red, and slot machines in Las Vegas that tell
one of his jokes when you pull the handle. He is also putting
together a memoir, tentatively titled "It Ain't Easy Being Me: Rodney
Reveals His Bouts With Depression, His Love for Swiss Cheese, Lions
and His Lifelong Romance With Marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to think of any other ventures," he said. "Well, I do
commercials, you know? In fact, I got a commercial running this week
-- Glad Bags, you know?" Though he continues to put out products,
Dangerfield shares a kinship with Johnny Carson, whom Dangerfield
regularly slayed during appearances on "The Tonight Show" ("Hey, I
tell you, when I was a kid I went through plenty. My uncle's dying
wish -- he wanted me on his lap. He was in the electric chair!")</TE>
<TE>   Today Dangerfield and Carson, for all their differences, are
similarly reclusive. "What is anybody gonna tell Carson that he
doesn't know?" Dangerfield said. "You know what I mean? He don't need
anybody. He's self-contained. If he left his house, where's he gonna
go?" According to his wife, Dangerfield's heart troubles persist. He
can no longer drink, because alcohol interferes with his various
medications. Ever the warhorse, Dangerfield will appear on "The
Tonight Show With Jay Leno" tonight, his birthday. This was where he
was a year ago, on his 80th, when Dangerfield suffered a mild heart
attack backstage. Admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, he smoked
some pot in his room and ran afoul of the staff. Dangerfield's world,
already fairly closed, continues to shrink by degrees. Joe Ancis, an
old New York friend whom Dangerfield took in for 18 years, and a man
Dangerfield calls "the funniest guy I know," died recently. Two grown
kids from Dangerfield's first marriage are on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A. Rodney and Joan Dangerfield, ensconced in their 21st floor
condo, don't go out much. They stay up all night, going to bed around
4 or 5 in the morning, Joan said. It's an old habit from
Dangerfield's late nights of performing. (Indeed, he briefly nodded
off while his '80s comic rap song, "Rappin' Rodney" played in the
background). In the wee hours, Joan Dangerfield said, she and Rodney
do miscellaneous things. They look at the computer. She'll go on
www.google.com and search her husband's name. "I'll check to see how
many times Rodney's name was mentioned in the news today," she said
-- as in who was described as the "Rodney Dangerfield of .... "</TE>
<TE>   They met over a decade ago, Joan Dangerfield said, when Rodney was
at the Pritikin Center on Santa Monica beach, and she was running a
flower shop at the Santa Monica Place Mall. Dangerfield kept coming
into the shop, and "gradually, I started looking forward to his
visits," she said. She is from Ogden, Utah, and 30 years younger than
her husband. They dated for 10 years, during which Dangerfield was
living at the Beverly Hilton, and then got married in 1993, on a
whim, in Las Vegas. After the wedding, the couple had dinner and
Rodney played craps, and that same night they came home.</TE>
<TE>   She mothers him, she admits, in addition to managing his affairs.
"A typical day?" Rodney Dangerfield said. "Well, I read poetry a
lot." He chuckled, because he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Dangerfield says he's tried psychiatrists. "It's difficult for me.
I can't buy their antics, or whatever it is. I've had a lot of
discussions with psychiatrists. It never really did anything." What
would make him feel better? "A couple of drinks," he said ruefully,
"a couple of joints."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the robes, marijuana comes up often in the
anecdotes comedians tell about him. His appetites are part of his
legend. But beyond this good-natured admiration is a reverence. For
comedians, the arc of Dangerfield's career symbolizes the business
and all its heartache, possibilities and glory. He was born Jacob
Cohen in Babylon, N.Y. He began writing jokes at 15. He performed
stand-up for a decade under the name Jack Roy. He quit comedy at 28
and sold aluminum siding and worked the construction business for
another decade-plus, a married man with a wife and kids in New
Jersey, before coming back to stand-up in his 40s, re-christened
Rodney Dangerfield, big-eyed and sweaty-browed, in jacket and tie. He
got no respect, no respect at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, since I was a kid, women always gave me a hard time.
My mother never breast-fed me. She told me she liked me as a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "My old man didn't help, either. One time I was kidnapped. They
sent back a piece of my finger. He said he wanted more proof."</TE>
<TE>   In the Washington Post, Dangerfield once recalled what Jack Benny
told him: "Rodney, I'm cheap and I'm 39, that's my image, but your
'no respect,' that's into the soul of everybody, everybody can
identify with that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fashionably late</TE>
<TE>   "The 4th Tenor" had a 7 p.m. red-carpet call, and by 7:20
Dangerfield had yet to show up. The celebrities in attendance --
actor Gary Busey, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner and six blonds -- had
already walked the red carpet, which was about 15 cameras shy of a
media gantlet.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he late or is he having open-heart surgery?" comedian Bob
Saget said, standing with a few stragglers outside. Dangerfield had
put Saget in one of his young comedian cable specials back in the
day. The list of comedians Dangerfield has helped and/or influenced
is long and luminous. But it most famously includes Jim Carrey and
the late Sam Kinison.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a limo pulled up, and out stepped Joan and Rodney
Dangerfield. Trailing him was the veteran film and television
producer David Permut, who was shooting footage for what he hopes
will be a movie. Permut met Dangerfield in a Las Vegas steam room and
has been collecting video string on the comedian for some 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Dangerfield had planned the premiere/birthday party. The
sidewalk string music. The girls in Italian peasant outfits, stomping
grapes outside the theater. The flashing ice cubes in the glasses of
Rodney's Red served at the Napa Valley Grille. When the screening
ended, Dangerfield sat in a seat in the last row of the theater,
shaking hands and receiving accolades. Most everyone said the film
was "cute," which pleased him, but this might have been the most
difficult part of the night, all that physical contact with his
fellow human beings.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed more comfortable later, at the Napa Valley Grille, as he
dug into a plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, the party loud and
happening around him. "Oh, look how cute he is!" exclaimed former
"Saturday Night Live" cast member Molly Shannon. She had been in "My
5 Wives" (Rodney as a real estate king/polygamist) and went to give
Dangerfield a big hello. Seated at the comedian's table were Joan,
Brad Garrett, of the CBS sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond," Garrett's
wife, and a woman who Joan Dangerfield later said had finagled a
place at the table, even though nobody knew who she was.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett, by contrast, was Dangerfield's invited guest. A former
stand-up, Garrett said Dangerfield gave him the courage to go onstage
and tell jokes about being "a 6-foot-9-inch geek" and "a Jew who
couldn't play ball." He didn't know Dangerfield personally, but he
had come to pay his respects.</TE>
<TE>   So, in a way, had everybody, even the hangers-on -- the friends of
friends of someone connected to "The 4th Tenor" -- who were now
eating crab and drinking booze, too young to care who Dangerfield was
but nevertheless enjoying themselves on his dime.</TE>

<HD>Bond's 40 but refuses to behave</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timely -- and as demographically savvy as ever -- James Bond enters
his new adventure off the coast of North Korea with some fast and
furious surfing designed to show the "XXX" generation that the 007
dude still has the stuff. The waves and silhouetted figures riding
the massive curls inspire a shiver of delight along with a tremor of
hope that the world's coolest franchise has finally ditched his
blockbuster bloat and just maybe the Dry Look in order to power-surf
into the new millennium. It's about then, as the waves and our hopes
crest, that "Die Another Day" cuts to one of the surfers pulling off
his mask to reveal the untroubled face of Pierce Brosnan, whose
glazed implacability suggests a man who rarely gets shaken, much less
stirred.</LD>
<TE>   Launched with "Dr. No," the Bond franchise began 40 years ago with
Her Majesty's sexiest spy thwarting a plot to destroy the American
space program while swanning about Jamaica, a setting that lent an
undeniable frisson to the film's premiere during the Cuban Missile
Crisis. The latest Bond opens against a similarly providential
geopolitical backdrop on the North Korean side of the demilitarized
zone. The communist nation is such a freakish, unsexy locale (no
purring Pussy Galore here) that once 007 lands you want him to surf
right out again. Instead, he squares off against a colonel (Will Yun
Lee) who's trafficking in diamonds mined in horror spots such as
Sierre Leone, only to have his cover blown.</TE>
<TE>   The botch leads to a Hovercraft chase, followed by 14 months of
Bond bondage, torture and beard growth that, bizarrely, unfolds to
the techno thump of Madonna's cheerless title song and under the
usual opening-credit nudie cuties. Once freed and faced with charges
that he gave up other agents while imprisoned, Bond spends the
remainder of the story shaking off the film's dank opening as he
clears his name and traces blood diamonds to Iceland by way of London
and a snarky magnate, Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Among the other
players the agent encounters as he hopscotches continents are one of
colonel's henchmen, Zao (Rick Yune), an arm accessory named Miranda
Frost (Rosamund Pike) and an enigma in a hot bikini, Jinx, played by
Halle Berry, Bond's newest love interest and Brosnan's highly visible
partner in advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Berry brings about as much conviction as you might expect to a
role that, essentially, is the bodacious equivalent of a hit of
Viagra. First seen rising up from the Caribbean waters as Ursula
Andress did in "Dr. No," a knife strapped to the belt slung over her
hips, the Academy Award-winner has been brought in to jump-start
Bond's engine and as a consequence she never fully transcends the
standard Bond girl limitations. She looks fabulous running after bad
guys while brandishing a gun, her sundress lashing her bare thighs,
but she's also about as persuasive an operative as Beyonce Knowles
was in the last Austin Powers lollapalooza. It isn't only that Berry
lacks the ferocious determination that turned Carrie-Anne Moss into a
cult with the release of "The Matrix"; it's that the Bond movie she's
signed onto lacks it as well.</TE>
<TE>   Perched uneasily between lingering self-parody and the filmmakers'
clear desire for a Bond vehicle to be taken seriously as an action
movie, "Die Another Day" remains caught somewhere in between. There
are times when it feels like two separate, at times warring movies.
The first stars Brosnan, a very fit 49-year-old actor who's
nonetheless 49, and whose callow appeal has been best put to use in
films that bring out his vaguely louche hauteur, as John Boorman did
in his underrated spy movie, "The Tailor of Panama." The second Bond
film, in turn, features younger actors such as Berry and Rick Yune
("The Fast and the Furious"), whose sleek black clothes and
martial-arts poses offer continued evidence that "The Matrix" is the
type of defining movie that doesn't just cast long shadows, it
reconfigures the very genre.</TE>
<TE>   The Bond films have almost always been primarily feats of
engineering, and directing them has often seemed better suited to
technicians rather than to artists or craftsmen: Their real auteurs
have always been the star, the producers, the composers and
opening-credit guru Maurice Binder. Yet we expect more out of our
action movies than we did in the early 1960s (we expect John Woo or
"The Matrix"), which is why the Bond producers have in recent years
tried to elevate the filmmaking by bringing in something of a name
director. The gambit to class up "The World Is Not Enough" didn't pan
out, however, and director Michael Apted's contribution remains an
undistinguished blur made conspicuous only by the insanely silly
casting of the pneumatically endowed Denise Richards as a "Doctor of
Atomic Physics."</TE>
<TE>   There's a better payoff this time with Lee Tamahori. A director
with a facility for putting a high sheen on pulp, the New Zealander
honed his action chops on "The Edge," a thriller in which he
simultaneously wrangled Alec Baldwin, Anthony Hopkins and a grizzly
bear. Tamahori springs a few surprises in "Die Another Day" --
including a nimbly choreographed swordfight between Bond and the
magnate -- but given the requisite din of artillery, gadgets and plot
complications, it's impossible to gauge where the director leaves off
and the rest of the production crew kicks in. As is usually the case
with Bond, the big action has been left to others and here it's
executive producer Anthony Waye who earns kudos for the surf sequence
while second unit director Vic Armstrong, who did most of the action
last time, gets credit for an ice-bound car chase.</TE>
<TE>   "Die Another Day" is only intermittently entertaining but it's
hard not to be a sucker for its charms, or perhaps it's just
impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with. The
franchise has been thrashing about in a prolonged middle-aged crisis
since Sean Connery tossed his hat onto Moneypenny's rack for the
final time but, still, there's something about it that remains
irresistible. If nothing else, "Die Another Day" is a wittily
self-knowing title for a money machine that has consistently managed
to sputter to life again and again despite a surfeit of hack writing
and interminably logy action. Triumphant in spite of its flubs, the
series has even survived miscalculations that would have killed off a
less robust formula, including the onetime casting of George Lazenby
in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and the slide into buffoonery
during the years with Roger Moore.</TE>
<TE>   The franchise's decline has often been blamed on the loss of
Connery, but even his last official Bond outings ("You Only Live
Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever") don't have a patch on the first
three. "Dr. No," "From Russia With Love" and "Goldfinger" are lean in
plot, mean in attitude and come in under two hours. They're also the
movies in which the star wears the best toupees. Even now, the shock
of Connery's flattened coif in the opening brawl of "Thunderball,"
the fourth installment, comes across as a sign of bad things to come,
an omen born out by the lugubrious story. The 1965 hit is the first
Bond feature to creep past the two-hour mark, with much of the
creeping done underwater with seemingly endless scenes of Bond and
Co. swimming, faces obscured by masks and bubbles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if James Bond no longer resonates as the character did in
the early 1960s, it's principally because the romance of the secret
agent is itself a thing of the past. Ian Fleming's creation was an
attractive myth, the roguishly handsome face of an otherwise obscured
world. These days, though, when we think about spies our image is
that of faceless operatives executing covert, at times illegal
missions or equally faceless bureaucrats sitting at their desks while
they sell out their colleagues. The allure of the suave secret agent
endures, but what now keeps us engaged aren't the affinities between
the screen and the real world but the differences. There is, after
all, something comforting in the idea that all it takes to save us is
a supercilious accent and a tuxedo. It's no wonder that FBI turncoat
Robert Hanssen, who surely knew better, was a Bond fan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Die Another Day'</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for action violence and sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Times guidelines: This one seems less gratuitously sadistic than
many of the later Bond films. There's some suggestive adult sexuality
but no frontal nudity.</TE>

<LD>I remember the day I turned on TV and immediately began trembling
with excitement and fear.</LD>
<LD>   Excitement because I was watching "Sportsman's Quest," one of many
wildlife series on ESPN2.</LD>
<LD>   Fear, because of the danger.</LD>
<TE>   My pulse was thumping, my heart beating like a tom-tom, for on the
screen, vulnerable and exposed in southern Africa, was Jay Novacek.</TE>
<TE>   Sportsman in peril.</TE>
<TE>   Novacek had known pain. As a former tight end for the Dallas
Cowboys, he'd been slammed to the turf by bruisers outweighing him by
75 pounds. He'd been shoved, crunched, hammered, bent, speared,
trampled, pummeled, kneed, creamed.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents had battered and punished him severely enough to send
him grimacing to the bench feeling as if run over by a truck.</TE>
<TE>   But never had he experienced such terror, for facing him now was a
threat much greater than any he'd encountered on a football field.
Just a few hundred yards away, capable of closing the distance in
seconds, was a creature so ravenous for grass and shrub sprouts that
it made my skin crawl just to hear its name.</TE>
<TE>   Kudu!</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the striped African antelope with long twisted, spiral horns.
Grassy areas, beware!</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the tone projecting danger. Why ... the hungry kudu could
mistake Novacek for a shrub sprout. It could charge him, hurl its 500
pounds at him, impale him. Worse, it could nibble him to death.</TE>
<TE>   So what was a sportsman to do?</TE>
<TE>   Novacek and his professional guide stalked, they advanced, they
hid, they whispered, they quietly observed. Then ready ... aim ...
and in self-defense:</TE>
<TE>   Kablooie!</TE>
<TE>   "Great shot!" proclaimed the guide. As the two men later stood
over the lifeless antelope, Novacek was clearly overwhelmed by his
achievement. "Wow! Holy cow! Look at the sight of him! He's
beautiful!"</TE>
<TE>   Too beautiful to live.</TE>
<TE>   That was my introduction a while ago to ESPN2's abundance of
wildlife shows, that rare TV universe where premeditated killing is
not merely shown -- talk about your snipers in ambush -- but
encouraged. And where ending life is softened by such euphemisms as
"take," "cull," "thin," "manage," "harvest" and, my favorite,
"getting involved with the outdoors."</TE>
<TE>   As in another ESPN2 show, "Ultimate Outdoors With Wayne Pearson."
Cue suspense music as a hunter in hiding raises his rifle and
prepares to nail an elk. "Good shot!" someone shouts.</TE>
<TE>   On these shows all the shots are "good" or "great." Nothing too
gory. The crack of gunfire is followed immediately by footage of a
dead animal lying on the ground as if in a peaceful sleep, one from
which it will not awaken.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet death" is what prolific hunter Ernest Hemingway said he
dispensed to the animals whose heads he had mounted on his walls.</TE>
<TE>   Death is as clean on ESPN2. That's because messy shots are bad for
business. And business here is booming. "Sportsman's Quest" has
become "Cabela's Sportsman's Quest," for example, advertising its
major underwriter, a big clothing outfitter, just as ESPN2 also gives
viewers "NaturalGear's Wildlife Quest" and "Kawasaki's Under Wild
Skies."</TE>
<TE>   At commercial breaks, you also hear from a host of other sponsors,
including the National Rifle Assn. The line separating these shows
and their commercials is sometimes blurry, as when a NaturalGear
executive recently surfaced as an elk hunter on "NaturalGear's
Wildlife Quest."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't pay to get too huffy here, given the double standard of
some in the anti-hunting crowd who fall all apart at humans slaying
animals in the wild but think nothing of wearing and using animal
products or eating those that suffered and died in a slaughterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to mind as a vivid metaphor is Tony Soprano, the HBO
mobster who gorges himself on meat but weeps over ducks and was so
devastated by an act of animal cruelty recently that he whacked the
guy he held responsible.</TE>
<TE>   What some of us can't begin to comprehend, though, is the
exhilaration hunters experience when arbitrarily ending the life of a
sentient creature they ooh and ahh over and profess to admire.</TE>
<TE>   I recall seeing an ESPN2 show's feature on adults teaching kids,
ages 10-12, "hunting ethics" and "respect for the animals you
harvest," while thinking their thrills would multiply were they
learning to operate cameras in the presence of "prey" instead of guns
and crossbows. Instead, a kid, so tiny his orange vest draped him
like a tunic, aimed his rifle at an unsuspecting deer from behind a
tree as his teacher whispered instructions. The next sound I heard --
boom! -- signaled a rite of passage being attained.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, ambushing wild turkeys on "NaturalGear Wildlife Quest"
one day this week was a foursome that included host and executive
producer Shane Jones, who is a noted archer, and Daytona 500 champ
Ward Burton, on whose "wildlife foundation" property this hunt was
held.</TE>
<TE>   A shot from a blind found its target, after which there were
high-fives and a round of congrats. "Incredible turkey," someone
said. Then they all marched off together like Dorothy and her pals in
"The Wizard of Oz," birds slung over their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   And under those "Wild Skies," caribou-hunting actor Brad Johnson
bagged himself a "beautiful bull" in Canada, while getting involved
with the outdoors on "Cabela's Sportsman's Quest" were Novacek and
professional angler Denny Brauer, their excitement palpable as
whitetail deer advanced into their crosshairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Brauer whispered from his hiding placed in the brush. "If
that's what I think it is, that is a monster deer coming right at us.
That is the one I've been waiting for. C'mon. C'mon. Stop right
there." A shot split the silence. "I got him," Brauer said.</TE>
<TE>   Cut to the dead deer, whose eyes gazed vacantly as its head was
held up for the camera. "Golly, I don't believe it," said Brauer.
"It's the biggest deer I have ever taken. Wow, look at that deer.
It's absolutely beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   So beautiful it had to die.</TE>

<HD>Viewers swoon over 'The Bachelor'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ratings bouquet went to ABC on Wednesday, as the two-hour finale
of "The Bachelor" attracted nearly 26 million viewers, easily
defeating "The West Wing" and "The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show."</LD>
<LD>   Based on Nielsen Media Research estimates, the average represented
ABC's biggest Wednesday audience for any entertainment program in
more than three years, as viewing steadily built through the
telecast. By way of comparison, tune-in exceeded Fox's "American
Idol" finale, as well as every episode of the current "Survivor."
Roughly 70% of "The Bachelor's" audience was female, registering its
highest ratings among younger women.</LD>
<LD>   In the concluding hour that actually was taped months ago, Aaron
Buerge -- the 28-year-old banker sifting through 25 women -- proposed
to Helene Eksterowicz, a 27-year-old from New Jersey. Although the
results were ostensibly kept under wraps, an online gambling service
ceased taking bets on the program a few weeks ago after an influx of
wagers on Eksterowicz from Buerge's hometown of Springfield, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   CBS' "Victoria's Secret" special averaged 10.5 million viewers,
falling short of last year's rating on ABC. According to Nielsen
data, an estimated 600,000 children ages 2 to 11 were in the
audience. Some watchdog and parents' groups complained that the
broadcast should have been scheduled at 10 p.m. because of its
content.</TE>
<TE>   Facing double-barreled competition, "The West Wing" slipped to 15
million viewers, the show's lowest new-episode rating since its first
season.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bachelor" fared even better in the Los Angeles area, where it
was watched in almost 20% of homes in the market.</TE>

<LD>Mary Richards has one, and so does Ralph Kramden. Soon there could be
a statue honoring Sheriff Andy Taylor and his young son, Opie.</LD>
<LD>   The TV Land cable network's offer of a statue of "The Andy
Griffith Show" characters, played by Andy Griffith and Ron Howard,
has received unanimous endorsement from the City Council in Raleigh,
N.C. Andy and Opie will be depicted on their way to the fishing hole,
just as they were in the opening sequence of the '60s sitcom.</LD>
<LD>   TV Land, which immortalized Kramden in New York in 2000 and
Richards in Minneapolis in May, will maintain the statue. Griffith
and Howard have endorsed the project, and it could go up in central
Raleigh as soon as next fall.</LD>

<LD>Danny Glover is in Trinidad to film a television program on AIDS and
children, a U.N. spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   The 55-year-old star of "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Color
Purple," will host the first of 10 episodes of "What's Going On?,"
scheduled to begin airing in January on the Showtime cable network,
U.N. spokeswoman Vashty Maharaj said.</LD>
<LD>   The series was originally to be called "Hot Spots," but the title
was changed after producers got the rights to use the title of the
well-known Marvin Gaye song, said Carmel M. Mulvaney, project
director for the U.N. Works Program.</LD>
<TE>   Each episode will explore the different struggles that children
face around the world. Angelina Jolie will visit a refugee camp in
Zambia and Jeff Bridges will host an episode looking at hunger in the
United States.</TE>

<HD>Gala plans for Disney Hall</HD>
<DH>The Philharmonic's new home will open Oct. 23 with three
fund-raising concerts and a season filled with premieres.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Concert Hall, a landmark in the making at the Los Angeles
Music Center since 1987, will finally be unveiled on Oct. 23, with a
ribbon-cutting ceremony at 10 a.m. and the first of three big-ticket
fund-raising gala concerts in the evening.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference Thursday, Deborah Borda, the orchestra's
executive director, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, its music director,
announced plans for the opening days of the hall and for its first
season.</LD>
<LD>   On consecutive nights, Oct. 23-25, in front of patrons paying up
to $5,000 each for tickets, the orchestra will present three
different inaugural concerts: first, a program meant to show off the
hall's acoustics, with works for single instrument up to full
orchestra. Next, works from the 20th and 21st centuries, including a
Philharmonic-commissioned world premiere from Bay Area composer John
Adams and an appearance by star cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Finally, a movie
music tribute with another new work created and conducted by John
Williams.</LD>
<TE>   Overall in 2003-04, the Philharmonic will present almost 50% more
programming than in the past. It plans nine world premieres, a season
record for the orchestra. It will present two major international
orchestras -- the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Simon Rattle, and
the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Lorin Maazel -- and a stellar
lineup of guest conductors including Pierre Boulez, Christoph von
Dohnanyi, Valery Gergiev and Charles Dutoit. It will unveil five new
music series from Baroque concerts to jazz and world music programs,
and launch partnerships with such organizations as CalArts, the
Museum of Contemporary Art and the Getty Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen and Borda took the stage after a recorded presentation
that included footage of the hall and its supporters. Walt Disney
Concert Hall, Borda said, "is a metaphor for music, and I think, for
transformation, with its undulating curves." Throughout her address
to an audience of almost 300, she stressed the hall's role in
democratizing classical music, the Philharmonic's outreach efforts,
and the classical repertory as "living music."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview afterward, she described the orchestra's plans as
ambitious, but emphasized that the season was "an investment, a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the orchestra. So we're spending
money." Borda also said the orchestra has new sponsors, to be
announced later, and that while the Philharmonic was feeling the
economic downturn, its finances were fundamentally sound.</TE>
<TE>   One of the season's opening themes, Salonen said, is creation, in
honor of the new hall. The orchestra's first regular-season concert,
for example, will feature Mahler's Symphony No. 2, the
"Resurrection"; its second, Haydn's "The Creation." The preview
concerts before the galas are open to children and to invited
community members.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to open for an elite," Salonen said in an interview
following the conference, "but for the people of the area. Of course,
it also helps us tune the hall acoustically."</TE>
<TE>   The stainless-steel-clad structure at the corner of Grand and 1st
streets -- designed by architect Frank O. Gehry, with acoustics by
Yasuhisa Toyota of Nagata Acoustics -- will replace the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion as the orchestra's home.</TE>
<TE>   Created specifically for orchestral music, the new hall has as
many as 932 fewer seats than the Pavilion and a "vineyard"-style
auditorium of terraced seats meant to put the listeners close to the
players. The space also includes the Roy E. and Edna Disney/CalArts
Theater, under the direction of CalArts, two outdoor amphitheaters, a
public garden, an art gallery and a restaurant to be run by the
Patina chain. The Philharmonic shares the space with the Los Angeles
Master Chorale.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Hall's construction has been fraught and at times
star-crossed. The hall, now expected to cost $274 million, began with
a $50-million gift from Walt Disney's widow, Lillian B. Disney, in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Gehry won a six-architect competition to design the hall.
In the years following the unveiling of his design, the project faced
funding problems, spiraling costs, added earthquake requirements, and
work stoppages.</TE>
<TE>   Ground was broken in December 1992, with the hall scheduled to
open in 1996 at a far lower cost. In 1995, the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors considered abandoning the project, but instead
extended the fund-raising and construction deadlines. Construction
began again in late 2000 and is on track for the October opening.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the hall's three opening galas, there will be free
"preview," invitation-only concerts before the official opening --
one for schoolchildren, one for educators, community members and
county employees, and one for the construction workers. After that, a
recital by pianist Evgeny Kissin kicks off the subscription season.</TE>
<TE>   The prices for single tickets to regular concerts have not yet
been announced. Most season subscription fees have increased, with
the lowest-priced tickets going from $14 to $35, and the
highest-priced seats rising from $82 to $120. With Disney Hall in the
offing, the Philharmonic says subscriptions have increased from
22,000 last year to 27,000 for the current season.</TE>
<TE>   The first month of regular Disney Hall programming offers
something of a microcosm for the inaugural season. Three of the new
series will debut, one devoted to Baroque composition, another to
jazz, and one to world music. An adult education program called First
Nights, which reconstructs famous music premieres, will have its
first outing.</TE>
<TE>   More familiar programming will begin as well: the Celebrity
Recital series, the Green Umbrella new-music series, and the Toyota
Symphonies for Youth. In late November, the first of the season's two
visiting orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic, led by Rattle, will
present two programs.</TE>
<TE>   A total of five world premieres, all of them Philharmonic
commissions, will be offered in the first month. John Adams' work is
called "The Dharma at Big Sur," a co-commission with the Philharmonic
Society of Orange County (after the second gala, it will be played
only once again during the season, in March 2004, at a Philharmonic
concert in Orange County). The as-yet-unnamed work by Williams will
include a chime theme for Disney Hall. Also premiering that month
will be pieces by Lee Hyla and Colin Matthews, which will both be on
the first Green Umbrella program, and a children's piece by Tan Dun.
In 2004, "Wing on Wing" a new work by Salonen will be unveiled, along
with works by Magnus Lindberg, Liza Lim and Steven Stucky.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the season, the Philharmonic will present works meant
to celebrate the bicentennial of French composer Hector Berlioz. In
January 2004, this will include a multimedia stage component created
by the London-based theater group Complicite. "Building Music," a
series of programs featuring works written for new landmark
structures, will be concentrated in the spring and will include
concerts, panels and symposia in conjunction with the Getty Research
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The season includes many other local partnerships -- an elementary
educational program with the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, for
example, and a free discussion-plus-music series co-presented with
CalArts and other local universities.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights of the Philharmonic season include a residency by
pianist Alfred Brendel, the continuation of the Shostakovich cycle,
two U.S. premieres and five West Coast premieres. The last category
includes a chamber opera by Argentine-born composer Osvaldo Golijov.</TE>

<HD>A full-length 'Solaris' still exceptional at 30</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nuart today brings back Andrei Tarkovsky's beautiful and
astonishing 1972 masterpiece "Solaris" for a one-week engagement in
advance of the Nov. 27 opening of Steven Soderbergh's remake starring
George Clooney. In 1976 the Nuart held three screenings of the most
complete version of "Solaris" available at that time, and, according
to the theater, this is the version that it is again presenting,
although its 167-minute running time is six minutes shorter than the
print it first screened.</LD>
<LD>   Fiercely demanding but newly fitted with more comprehensive
English subtitles, "Solaris" is a dazzlingly imaginative work with
awesome production values and special effects that bear comparison to
those of "2001." In essence, it is the odyssey of a Soviet scientist
(Donatas Banionis), a trained psychologist who travels to a space
station orbiting the remote planet Solaris. The Soviet government
would actually prefer to abandon the station, regarding reports of
some of its findings as too incredible to believe.</LD>
<LD>   Once the station had a crew of 85; now all that remains are two
men, whom Banionis has been sent to investigate</LD>
<TE>   The molten surface of Solaris seems to possess intelligence, and
when Banionis dreams of his dead wife (Natalya Bondarchuk), Solaris
causes her to materialize -- as a kind of bionic woman capable of
regeneration and instant recovery from injury. What ensues allows
Tarkovsky to contemplate the meaning of life itself through the
interplay of science, philosophy and emotion. "Solaris" is finally an
unabashedly romantic work in which the primacy of love is asserted --
but, as Jarvet says, "To preserve the truth we need mysteries."</TE>

<LD>Nobody's Perfect</LD>
<LD>   Billy Wilder -- A Personal Biography</LD>
<LD>   Charlotte Chandler</LD>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 352 pages, $27.50</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Writer Charlotte Chandler has befriended an impressively wide
range of legendary directors, ranging from Jean Renoir to Fritz Lang
to Michelangelo Antonioni.</TE>
<TE>   The ubiquitous Chandler ("Hello, I Must Be Going" and "I,
Fellini") has always asked the right questions and earned the
confidence of these and other formidable figures. It's a safe bet
that Billy Wilder, the subject of her latest book, "Nobody's
Perfect," would have been happy with the result, which is subtitled
"A Personal Biography."</TE>
<TE>   She has taken exactly the right approach to Wilder, who would have
abhorred any trace of academic cant and pretension. Many years in the
making, it captures Wilder's voice yet is no mere transcription of
the extensive tapes Chandler made with the director, who died last
March at age 95.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler allows Wilder to tell the story of his life and his films
within her sharply observant yet admirably economical framework,
which includes contributions from a wide range of his collaborators.
Leave it to Chandler to get to even the most elusive of stars, Greta
Garbo, for whom Wilder collaborated on the script of Ernst Lubitsch's
classic romantic comedy "Ninotchka" (1939). Chandler maintains a
conversational tone that embraces a treasure trove of anecdotes and
information, and captures Wilder's famous wit.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1906 to a loving but not always successful businessman
father and a mother who longed to return to the America she had
visited, Wilder grew up in Vienna and at 18 decided upon a newspaper
career over university. He may have failed in his attempt to
interview Sigmund Freud, but hit it off so well with Paul Whiteman,
on a 1926 European tour, that he followed the orchestra leader to
Berlin, where he stayed to expand his journalistic opportunities.
When Wilder, always a movie fan, saw Sergei Eisenstein's
groundbreaking "Potemkin," he knew he wanted a career in films. He
was an established screenwriter when he fled Hitler for Paris and
later Hollywood. By 1936, Wilder was on his way when he was assigned
to collaborate with Charles Brackett on the script for Lubitsch's
"Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," which was to star Claudette Colbert.</TE>
<TE>   The teaming of Wilder and the aristocratic, articulate,
ultra-conservative Brackett would carry Wilder to the heights and
pave the way for his Hollywood directorial debut with "The Major and
the Minor" (1942), starring Ginger Rogers. Such classics as "Double
Indemnity" (1944) and "The Lost Weekend" (1945) were to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunset Boulevard" (1950), arguably the definitive movie about
Hollywood, took Wilder to the pinnacle. "Stalag 17," "The Seven Year
Itch," "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment" (the latter two written
with I.A.L. Diamond) would keep him there for another decade. The
'70s began badly, with Wilder forced to trim an hour from a cherished
project, "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes," originally intended
as a roadshow presentation. The decade ended with the fascinating but
flawed "Fedora," and Wilder's career concluded with a fizzle, "Buddy
Buddy" (1981) with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, who couldn't say
no to their friend.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder faces this downward spiral squarely, with not even so much
as a mention of his long search for relief from severe back pain,
which surely helped sidetrack him until it was too late to resume his
career. Wilder directed many glamorous actresses -- he admired
Marlene Dietrich the most -- but avoided romances with his stars. He
often remarked on how difficult it was to work with the chronically
late and insecure Marilyn Monroe but found it always worth it, and
here he and Tony Curtis reveal just how tough, maddening and finally
sad it was.</TE>
<TE>   Several actresses express regret that an enduring friendship did
not develop with Wilder after a picture was finished, the way it had
with Matthau and especially Lemmon. But it's clear that his widow,
Audrey, his elegant wife of more than half a century, was the adored
center of his existence.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder knew that wonderful quips were expected of him, and he
unfailingly delivered. Yet the remarks in "Nobody's Perfect" that
linger longest are the most touching, those that express gratitude
toward his adopted country. Wilder, who lost his mother and other
relatives to the Holocaust, told of having to go to Mexicali six
months after his arrival in the U.S. in 1934 to renew his visa with
the U.S. consul. The diplomat proved to be encouraging. When Wilder
explained that he wrote movies, the consul stamped his passport,
saying, "Write some good ones."</TE>
<TE>   In telling this story, Wilder always said, "I've lived my life
trying my best not to disappoint that dear man."</TE>

<HD>A rapturous Midori moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is, indeed, a golden age of violinists. At a masterly 31, the
Japanese-born Midori stands as the leader -- actually the
groundbreaker -- of its younger generation.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night, Midori began the second week of her current
Los Angeles Philharmonic residency in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
playing the once-neglected, now-ubiquitous Violin Concerto by Samuel
Barber. She gave this benign masterpiece, one that soars without ever
huffing or puffing, its due in effortless lyricism, thrilling
climaxes and a probing lightness.</LD>
<LD>   She was aided with sensitive authority by conductor Esa-Pekka
Salonen and the resourceful orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   Salonen surrounded the 63-year-old concerto with Christopher
Rouse's recent (2000) "Rapture" and with Beethoven's "Eroica"
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "Rapture," the composer told the pre-concert event audience in the
Grand Hall, is an 11-minute piece that progresses "from contentment
to joy." That proved to be so in the Philharmonic's enthusiastic
reading but does not tell the whole truth. "Rapture" is actually
noisy and dense, and Rouse's description of it as wholly tonal and in

<HD>KMPC turns back dial to its golden age</HD>
<DH>Gathered at a reunion party for the AM mainstay of the '60s
and '70s, former staffers ask, 'Did you Whittinghill this morning?'</DH>

<LD>KMPC gave Southern California the Angels and the SigAlert, but the
memories at a staff reunion Wednesday night were of the talents --
on- and off-air -- that made the station a fixture on L.A. radio
dials in the 1960s and '70s.</LD>
<LD>   Before singing cowboy Gene Autry sold the station to ABC in 1994,
710 on the AM band was where listeners could get "a little happiness,
a little news," according to former general manager Stan Spero.</LD>
<LD>   "We tried to be everywhere anything happened. We tried to provide
entertainment, information, sports and civic involvement," he said,
whether it was through pioneering traffic reports, use of news
helicopters, broadcasts of Rams, Bruins and Angels games, or the
efforts of a lineup of celebrity DJs. "We have a government license
-- we have to be, and should be, involved in civic activities."</LD>
<TE>   And he believes that integration into the community was what
resonated with the audience and made the station such a ratings
leader.</TE>
<TE>   The tribute was organized by radio historian Don Barrett, host of
the "Los Angeles Radio People" Web site (www.laradio.com) and author
of two almanacs of Southland radio personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "Without these kinds of events, this history goes away. And KMPC
was such an important station," said Barrett, who added that the
evening's focus was the "golden age" of KMPC, "when the personalities
were at their best. Each one was unique, and in today's homogenized
radio, you can't tell one personality from the other."</TE>
<TE>   The station was full-service, offering music, news and sports, and
played a middle-of-the-road format that preceded Top 40, which
Barrett said could feature Elvis Presley one minute and bossa nova by
Antonio Carlos Jobim the next. But it was the freewheeling on-air
hosts who, with their knowledge of music, or idiosyncratic humor,
kept the listeners dialed in.</TE>
<TE>   "KMPC was one of the most successful radio stations in the
country, and had the lineup -- the most envied talent in the radio
business," said Roger Carroll, who played records on KMPC. The key to
their success, he said, was a rapport with the audience. "Everybody
who listened to the station thought we were their friends."</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great audience," added news director Bob Steinbrinck.
"They were bright, they had a sense of humor, and they wanted to be
informed."</TE>
<TE>   The main feature Wednesday night was a discussion panel, which
included Steinbrinck, Spero and former DJs Carroll, Johnny Grant,
Geoff Edwards, Gary Owens and Johnny Magnus, who answered questions
and reminisced before an audience of about 120 former listeners and
station employees.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, best known now as the honorary mayor of Hollywood, talked
about the origins of traffic reports on his show, which evolved into
"Johnny's Freeway Club," complete with its own jingle.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody called me when I was on the air between 2 and 6 and
said, 'You're not going to believe it: There's a mattress in the No.
2 lane.' I said, 'Is there anybody on the mattress? And if so, what
are they doing?' " Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   It was in traffic reports that former station co-owner Loyd C.
Sigmon saw an opportunity to attract listeners. In 1955 he rigged a
device that Los Angeles police dispatchers could activate during
freeway tie-ups that would relay their radio traffic to KMPC, so the
station's announcers could alert listeners to the problem. Police
Chief William Parker said the system was too valuable to be exclusive
to one station, but honored Sigmon by naming the warnings SigAlerts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to news, the station was known for its sports
programming, which not only included Bruins basketball during the
team's John Wooden dynasty, but also the genesis of Angels baseball.
Autry went to major-league baseball owners' winter meetings in 1960
because the Dodgers had pulled their games from KMPC, and he wanted
to secure the broadcast rights for one of the new expansion teams the
following year. Instead, he came home with a team -- the then-Los
Angeles Angels -- after the prospective owner dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to trading anecdotes about Autry's generosity and
easygoing nature, the group paid tribute to the late Dick
Whittinghill, who died last year, and to his successor, Robert W.
Morgan, who died in 1998. The former, the morning host who spent 30
years at KMPC, made Angelenos inquire, "Did you Whittinghill this
morning?" while the latter's signature was wishing his listeners
"Good Morgan" every a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said the station was imbued with a spirit "that made us do
outrageous things. You've got to be a little off the wall." Such as
ferrying 1,000 listeners to Catalina for a golf match between
Whittinghill and evening host Clark Race, or Carroll's hosting a
program from a jumbo jet en route to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to radio today, there's nothing left to the
imagination," said Bob Maryon, longtime engineer on Whittinghill's
show. "It wasn't so formatted. It wasn't so structured. People never
knew what was going to happen, and everything didn't always go
smoothly."</TE>
<TE>   But the staff often spun the slip-ups into gold. A segment in
which Owens breaks up while reading an advertisement -- a Christmas
greeting from Preparation H -- was replayed as a holiday tradition
for years afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be known for something sophisticated," said Owens,
who took his non sequiturs and deadpan humor to the national stage on
NBC's "Laugh-In," one of several talents who found even greater fame
on television.</TE>
<TE>   When "Shotgun" Tom Kelly of KRTH-FM (101.1) was a teenager, he was
such a fan that he rode the train up from San Diego to watch Owens
work, and even ran into his idol once while sneaking into the station
office. Owens invited him in and showed him around.</TE>
<TE>   "It was 'The Radio Station of the Stars.' Any stars that were in
Hollywood, they were on somebody's show," said Kelly, who attended
the reunion. "It was just a class radio station."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Benoit, who handled public relations for the station, among
other jobs, said the camaraderie kept employees there for decades,
and made it as enjoyable a place to work as it was to listen to.</TE>
<TE>   "KMPC can't be duplicated," Benoit said. "It was truly a magical
time in Los Angeles radio."</TE>

<LD>Determined to diversify programming at the Walt Disney Concert Hall,
the Los Angeles Philharmonic introduced jazz and world music series
at Thursday's announcement of the inaugural season in the house that
Frank Gehry built.</LD>
<LD>   The schedule, the first under the stewardship of singer Dianne
Reeves, consists of four concerts: Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock and
Jack DeJohnette (Nov. 12, 2003); Reeves with George Duke, the L.A.
Philharmonic and special guests (Jan. 24, 2004); Wynton Marsalis and
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (March 15, 2004); and the Herbie
Hancock Quartet with the L.A. Philharmonic, performing a Gershwin
program (May 1, 2004).</LD>
<LD>   Reeves describes the schedule as intending to "pay homage to many
of the great architects of jazz, some of the great jazz artists
today, as well as a few voices of the future."</LD>
<TE>   Very few "voices of the future," as it turns out, and literally no
surprises -- other than, perhaps, the scheduling of a concert by
Reeves, rather than, say, such a higher-visibility vocal attraction
as Cassandra Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Disney Hall scheduling of artists such as Jarrett and
Hancock -- staples of the UCLA Performing Arts schedules -- trigger
any sort of booking war for major name jazz talent?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Live director David Sefton, who could not be reached for
comment Thursday, has always expressed the view that everyone
benefits from more performance opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   But advance word suggests that the 2003-04 UCLA Live season will
not be as rich with jazz entries as the current schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The initial world-music season at Disney Hall includes
performances by Cape Verdean diva Cesaria Evora, in a concert with
strings (Nov. 18, 2003); an appearance by Portuguese fado singer
Mariza with the L.A. Philharmonic (April 2, 2004); a concert by
Indian drummer Zakir Hussain with the Masters of Percussion (April
24, 2004); and a fourth event to be announced later. The programming,
by Tom Schnabel, offers an attractive blend of an established artist
(Evora), with an emerging star (Mariza) and a display of world roots
music (Hussain).</TE>

<HD>Eclectic Sam Rivers displays plenty of horn</HD>
<DH>Performing in a versatile trio, the avant-garde sax veteran
delivers a wide-open session of free improvisation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Sam Rivers was one of the more active participants in the
avant-garde jazz world of the 1960s. Unlike many other players,
however, he came to the genre with solid mainstream credentials. And
his career, ever since, has tended to embrace a fairly broad array of
stylistic elements.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, Rivers -- performing in a
trio with longtime associates Doug Matthews on bass and Anthony Coles
on drums -- offered an opening set vividly displaying his eclectic
interests. He was particularly well-aided in that respect by the
group's instrumental versatility. One number was a three-woodwind
feature, with Matthews and Coles doubling on bass clarinet and tenor
saxophone in combination with Rivers. On another piece, Coles moved
to the piano to offer powerful, rhapsodic backing for Rivers' tenor
saxophone excursions.</LD>
<LD>   And in yet another shift of pace, Matthews stood alone on stage,
starting with an extensive bowed bass solo before shifting to
fast-paced pizzicato playing.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the music was expressed freely, beyond specific harmonies
or bar lines, with the exception of occasional segments in which
tonal centers and metric containment surfaced through the musical
mix. Free improvisation can be difficult for audiences, for obvious
reasons. Lacking a harmonic or rhythmic reference point, even the
most receptive minds can wander. More often than not, however,
Rivers' maturity and experience prevailed, as he structured his
wide-open playing and writing -- in which he used broad swaths of
sound as pure coloration -- with more engagingly lyrical passages.</TE>
<TE>   Equally vital to the overall success of the Rivers set was the
obvious connectivity between the players -- an especially important
factor in any sort of spontaneous improvising. Together for more than
five years, Rivers, Matthews and Coles seamlessly blended their
individual contributions into a consistently fascinating tapestry of
sound and rhythm. In the process, they made a convincing case for the
intriguing qualities that edgy, envelope-stretching jazz can have in
the hands of players with beyond-genre skill and imagination.</TE>

<HD>Hello again, Mr. Chips</HD>
<DH>Well cast though it is, 'The Emperor's Club' follows in
some politely familiar footsteps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Duke of Wellington has a lot to answer for.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since the man who conquered Napoleon insisted that "the
battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton," there's
been no end of books -- and later films -- dealing with the doings of
men and boys at the kind of snooty private schools most people would
be lucky to get into on visiting day.</LD>
<LD>   Films from "Tom Brown's Schooldays" to "Goodbye Mr. Chips" (not a
Famous Amos biopic) to "Dead Poets Society" have taken us behind
elite and ivied walls on both sides of the Atlantic to show off the
latest in blazer styles and illustrate what makes a difference in a
young lad's life and what does not.</LD>
<TE>   "The Emperor's Club" (the reference is to Julius Caesar, not
Wellington's nemesis) is the latest in this long, polite line. It's
well crafted by director Michael Hoffman, not painful to sit through,
and even contains some 21st century plot twists courtesy of
screenwriter Michael Tolkin and Ethan Canin, who wrote the original
short story, "The Palace Thief." But unless you have a predisposition
toward this kind of thing, none of that is going to matter much.</TE>
<TE>   Because finally not even having Kevin Kline as your star and
gifted newcomer Emile Hirsch as the young gentleman who is the focus
of all eyes is enough to budge this film from the exact middle of the
road. Though the message of "The Emperor's Club" is not precisely
what you might expect, it's an awfully familiar one nevertheless, a
theme that's too comfortable for its own good.</TE>
<TE>   Though the film has both a brief opening and an extended closing
section set in the present day, most of it is situated a quarter of a
century ago, in the storied halls of the mythical St. Benedict's, a
school where, as someone in the film notes, "a future who's who of
law, industry, finance and higher education" are gently but firmly
being molded into men.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant headmaster William Hundert (Kline) is happy to have a
hand in all of that, to be a key player in a school whose motto is
"Not for oneself." An old-fashioned, even prissy type who believes "a
man's character is his fate," he likes to point his boys to the
straight and narrow, going so far as to suggest they stay off the
grass with a platitudinous, "Follow the path where great men have
walked."</TE>
<TE>   Hundert is also a committed classics professor, the kind of
inspired teacher who gets his class to dress up in togas and like it.
He is also in charge of the school's Mr. Julius Caesar contest, a
rigorous test of knowledge that all the boys yearn to triumph in. He
has a faculty pal in Charles (Rob Morrow) and a close albeit platonic
relationship with Elizabeth (Embeth Davitz), the wife of a colleague.</TE>
<TE>   An Eden like this wouldn't even begin to be dramatically
interesting without a snake, and one soon enters in the form of
transferring student Sedgewick Bell (Hirsch), son of West Virginia
Sen. Hyram Bell (Harris Yulin).</TE>
<TE>   It's a given that anyone coming from West Virginia with the name
Sedgewick is going to have some issues, but this young man is a
genuine disturber of the peace, refusing to take anything seriously
and mocking everything St. Benedict's and Hundert hold dear.</TE>
<TE>   Though an out-of-control brat who has contempt for authority is
hardly an original conceit, actor Hirsch is talented enough to hold
our interest, at least initially, as a character who instigates
pranks, introduces his roommates to Oui magazine, and is charismatic
enough to gain quite a following.</TE>
<TE>   Hundert, who initially dismisses Sedgewick's attitude as "new
school bravado," decides at one point to attempt to take him under
his wing, to wage a battle for his immortal soul, so to speak. The
question of whether he 's converting the heathen or having his ideals
compromised by an infidel is where the film's dramatic center lies.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting as this dilemma may sound, the problem with "The
Emperor's Club" is that it's neither substantial enough to overcome
its short-story roots nor convincing enough to make us care which way
the issue is resolved. While the Duke of Wellington would likely have
enjoyed the proceedings, it's not clear who else will.</TE>

<HD>From the 007 files, with love: They wrote the book on Bond</HD>
<DH>A new tome covers the secret agent and his surprising
legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the past four decades, James Bond films have had a weird, almost
surreal impact on the real spy world.</LD>
<LD>   During the opening weekend of one of the recent Bond films, the
CIA set up a recruiting booth at theaters. "When the Army was putting
together an urban assault vehicle called the SmarTruck, they sat down
and watched Bond films," says John Cork, coauthor with Bruce Scivally
of the new coffee table book "James Bond: The Legacy" (Harry Abrams).</LD>
<LD>   "The CIA has this entire thing called the 'James Bond syndrome,' "
Cork says. "It is when agents defect and become double agents. What
they want is the glamorous Bond lifestyle as opposed to the real
drudge work of intelligence. Even way back in the early '70s, G.
Gordon Liddy was a tremendous Bond fan. If you read his book 'Will'
-- the sections on the Watergate burglaries, the prose is right out
of Ian Fleming."</LD>
<TE>   Cork notes that Bond's world "isn't our world, but it's close
enough to our world that you can dabble in it. If you are fortunate
enough to have deep enough pockets, you can dress like Bond, you can
drive Bond's cars and you can eat the same kind of food." And of
course drink the same type of shaken, not stirred, martinis.</TE>
<TE>   "James Bond: The Legacy" doesn't only go in depth into Fleming's
creation of 007 in the 1950s, the 320-page book also is filled with
rare photographs and odd facts about 007. (Among them: More than 70
million of Fleming's 14 Bond books have been published since 1953;
"Goldfinger," the first Bond movie to air on TV, was first televised
-- on ABC -- on Sept. 17, 1972; Bond's gadgets in "On Her Majesty's
Secret Service" included a combination safecracker and photocopying
machine.) Cork and Scivally are hard-core Bondphiles, having
produced, written and directed 30 documentaries for MGM's releases of
the Bond films on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   "My first memory of seeing any movie in any movie theater was
'From Russia With Love,' " Cork recalls. "As an adolescent I became a
huge fan when I saw 'Live and Let Die.' When you are 11 years old and
a boy, and you are right on the cusp of adolescence and you don't
know how to ask a girl to dance at a party, and you suddenly see this
character who has a great certainty of self, a great deal of
self-confidence, and knows how to handle himself in any situation.
That is how I wanted to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't drink vodka martinis very often. I drive a Volvo station
wagon, but those things that are within the character -- that sense
of purpose and self-confidence -- are masculine ideals that you
really want to have. Bond embraces a worldliness which I find very
refreshing, particularly growing up in Montgomery, Ala."</TE>
<TE>   Scivally became hooked on Bond upon seeing Connery in "Goldfinger"
when it first aired on ABC in September 1972. He and Cork met at USC
in the mid-1980s. "We had a couple of other friends, and we used to
get together in the dorms and play a 1960s James Bond board game,"
Scivally recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The suave secret agent has endured the test of time and five
incarnations, Scivally says, "because Bond is like Madonna. He keeps
reinventing himself. I think there are certain core things that
remain the same in the series, but the approach the films and the
different actors playing the roles take are different as time goes
on.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger Moore is a different Bond than Sean Connery was. Then when
Timothy Dalton came along I really liked him because he brought some
dignity back to the role, but once Pierce Brosnan started playing it,
I realized the thing Dalton lacked that Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean
Connery have in spades is charm."</TE>

<HD>For skid row's lion, a pride of successes</HD>

<LD>They gathered in a back room of the Midnight Mission, looking for all
the world like successful businessmen. There were 10 of them seated
around a table, some in coats and ties, others in open-collared
shirts. Each told a story of self-destruction, survival and
redemption, and their narratives were hymns of salvation.</LD>
<LD>   These are guys who climbed out of gutters of despair after years
of addiction to drugs and alcohol. They were there that night to
thank the man who helped them do it. His name is Clancy Imislund. To
a man, they said they owed him their lives. Some said it with tears
in their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   The Midnight Mission is a downtown gathering point for those
who've given up on themselves. They cluster like cattle around its
doorway, waiting for food in the daytime and hoping for beds at
night. Food they get, but there aren't enough beds for everyone, so
they set up tents across the street or just lie on the sidewalk, too
removed from humanity to connect with the world around them.</LD>
<TE>   The 10 who gathered for dinner in the back room had been among
them once, including Clancy, the canny old lion of skid row. He was a
family man and an advertising executive before booze drove him into a
hazy kind of hell. He came to the mission to save himself and ended
up as its managing director for more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Semiretired at 75, he's emeritus now but remains the undisputed
voice of L.A.'s down and out, bringing energy and tough love to the
dark side of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy hosted the dinner, obviously proud of those he helped to
reclaim their dignity. Quick smiles passed over his craggy face as he
listened to the stories the men told. They were Thomas, Gregg, Larry,
Vince, Paul, Mark, Angelo, Jeff, Orlando, Harvey. No last names,
please. It was all too personal and sometimes too painful to share.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando graduated from Stanford with a degree in marketing. He
worked hard and partied hard, but though work ended, the party went
on. Booze and crack drove him down to the row, where he awoke one
morning sprawled in a doorway with a rat gnawing at his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Vince graduated from Cornell with a degree in biochemistry. He
discovered alcohol in high school and drugs when he worked in a
hospital emergency room. Addiction cost him his future and almost his
life. "I was a loser," he said. "Clancy made me face myself." He's
been sober for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   At 33, Gregg was the youngest there. He began drinking as a
teenager and his parents disowned him. His high school graduation
present was a set of luggage. The message was clear, so he left
Cleveland for L.A., looking for tomorrow. Drugs and alcohol. The old
story. Clancy threw him out of the mission once. He had to help
himself, the old lion said. He did, and he's been sober since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Some came from alcoholic families. Some did time. Thomas was
wanted for the sale, possession and use of drugs. Clancy talked him
into turning himself in. He was granted probation and straightened
himself out at the mission. Now he's a corporate vice president of a
private banking firm.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the mission represented a last chance for all of
them. Clancy taught them to look at themselves, to ask for help, to
take hold of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   He knew what dark shadows they were walking through, because he'd
walked through them and had lost everything. It took five years of
sobriety to get his family back.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to develop coping skills to deal with addiction," one
man said, tears filling his eyes, "and Clancy gave me those skills."
Another called him "the patron saint of hopeless men." Others:
"Clancy saw something good in me." "This place changed my life." "No
one else wanted me until I came here."</TE>
<TE>   I kept thinking as I listened, why them? Why do some rise to great
heights and others sink to such terrible depths? What does it take,
what kind of insight or raw determination, to rise again? Who wins?
Who loses?</TE>
<TE>   There aren't too many standing ovations on Skid Row, but if there
were, Clancy would sure get one. After dinner, I watched as he walked
shirt-sleeved and self-assured past the men still out there, still
not ready to save themselves.</TE>
<TE>   There was a kind of animal royalty about the way he walked and
held his head and seemed unafraid amid the darkness that surrounded
him. It didn't take long for anyone to realize that a lion was in the
street.</TE>

<HD>A shining 'Pearl'</HD>
<DH>Who's the fairest of them all? The young 30-member cast of
Debbie Allen's energetic musical based on 'Snow White.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In time-honored fairy-tale tradition, Debbie Allen's musical
retelling of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is packed with
lessons, from proper dental care to being cautious around strangers.
But most of all, "Pearl," as she calls her story, is about tapping
inner truth and beauty, and letting it flow out into the world.</LD>
<LD>   To drive the point home, Allen surrounds herself at the Geffen
Playhouse with living examples of that maxim: 30
dancer-singer-actors, ages 6 to 18, who are absolutely incandescent.</LD>
<LD>   Allen may be the headliner, but these kids are the stars. When
seven pint-sized circus clowns make their entrance, looking like a
cross between Munchkins and the Little Rascals, the audience oohs and
awws so much that it nearly drowns out the children's first song.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the young performers are students at the Debbie Allen
Dance Academy in Culver City, where Allen -- a real-life counterpart
to the instructor she played in the movie and TV versions of "Fame"
-- is artistic director. She wrote "Pearl" for the education
department of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington, D.C., where the show received its premiere in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Geffen presentation is well-timed to be a holiday
parent-child activity, adults without children won't feel out of
place. In its energetic staging, entertainment-world jokes and music
(pop, doo-wop, hip-hop, drum-and-bass and other styles, written by
James Ingram, Diane Louie and Allen), the show contains a little
something for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   In this present-day retelling of the fairy tale, Snow White is
named Pearl (played through Dec. 1 by Allen's daughter, Vivian Nixon,
then by Natalia Johnson). The daughter of a dentist (Matthew
Dickens), Pearl is left, after his death, in the care of her
stepmother, a rock star known as the Queen (Allen, in Diana Ross
mode).</TE>
<TE>   Like all entertainers, the Queen lives under the curse of becoming
a has-been the moment her youth has passed. So trouble is in store
when her computer tells her that young Pearl is fairer and more
talented. The Queen orders her bodyguard, Q (Buddy Lewis, doing a
high-pitched, sibilant impersonation of Mike Tyson), to take Pearl to
the circus, then kill her on the way home.</TE>
<TE>   One of the show's chief delights, the circus is a Cirque du
Soleil-style explosion of gymnasts, contortionists, ribbon dancers
and de rigueur bare-chested guy who sails through the air with his
limbs entwined in streams of fabric. This last heartthrob, Charm
(Rasta Thomas), becomes Pearl's Prince Charming, and the seven
pint-sized clowns, called "dwowns," are her rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   A few plot points are under-explained in Allen's script, and the
show, which she directed and choreographed, contains several awkward
moments that cause the energy to abruptly drain from the stage. The
Queen's transformation into a hook-nosed, claw-handed crone also
might cause momentary concerns for parents with young children; a
comforting arm might prove suddenly necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Allen proves to be a gifted comic, however. As the Queen huffs and
puffs through a teen-pop number for which she is clearly too old, or
has herself laced into a scary-looking girdle, the audience almost
feels sorry for her.</TE>
<TE>   And as choreographer, Allen comes up with a particularly touching
number when Charm partners the slumbering, slack-limbed Pearl through
a ballet-like pas de deux -- his love for her triumphing over dark
magic.</TE>

<HD>Banal ideas give way to great art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Lichtenstein's abstract paintings at Gagosian Gallery offer an
eloquent argument against the seemingly sensible idea that great art
comes from great ideas. Just the opposite is true of the Pop artist's
"Perfect and Imperfect" series, which begins with an idea so
simplistic that it can only be described as dumb.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition's 14 canvases and 20 drawings follow the same
recipe. Start with a rectangle, either horizontal or vertical. Pick a
point on its perimeter and draw a diagonal line to another side.
Without picking up your pencil, do this again. And again and again,
from five to 12 times. The last line must take you back to the
starting point.</LD>
<LD>   Then fill in most of the spaces between the lines. Use solid
colors, diagonal stripes or dots.</LD>
<TE>   The only difference between Lichtenstein's "Perfect" and
"Imperfect" works is that the latter include a triangle or two that
extend beyond the edge of the original rectangle. This little gesture
transforms an ordinary four-sided canvas into a shaped painting. It
also suggests that Lichtenstein (1923-1997) got carried away -- that
his ricocheting pencil went too fast to stop before breaking out of
the image.</TE>
<TE>   That's an illusion. These paintings are among the most controlled
of his exceptionally deliberate oeuvre. He made three in 1978; the
rest are from 1986-88. (Nearly all were borrowed from the Roy
Lichtenstein Foundation and are not for sale.) They embody such a
surplus of linear mastery, coloristic nuance and formal refinement
that they turn a dumb idea into a springboard to experiences of
joyous exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing unsophisticated about the pleasures they deliver.
In many, buoyancy, verve and clarity pirouette around each other,
bouncing your eye around the picture plane with more animated energy
than a movie jam-packed with special effects.</TE>
<TE>   To see Lichtenstein's drawings (made with colored pencils on
ordinary sheets of graph paper) alongside his paintings is to see his
mind in action. Designs are refined, compositions balanced and
contrasts sharpened. Only a handful of his studies match the
paintings executed from them. The rest reveal changes he made as he
translated his dynamic patterns from paper to canvas, adjusting the
thickness of a line, altering the color of a triangle or shifting the
angle of a shape's edge.</TE>
<TE>   There's a flexibility to his art that suggests he loves rules for
the exceptions they make possible. One of the most fascinating pieces
is one of the "Perfect" paintings, made of sheets of patterned fabric
he stitched together. It's the only one in which Lichtenstein's line
changes direction in the middle of the image, not once but twice. In
three others, a gentle arc appears, throwing a curve of relaxation
into the otherwise straightforward geometry.</TE>
<TE>   In a newly expanded upstairs gallery (designed by Richard Meier &amp;
Partners) stands a small sculpture. Bringing Lichtenstein's acrobatic
lines off the wall and into the same space viewers occupy, this piece
of steel punctuates a magnificent exhibition by looking as if it,
too, is about to make a gravity-defying leap.</TE>

<TE>   Monumental paintings, done with a light touch</TE>
<TE>   Sean Scully's massive paintings, some of which are as big as the
walls in most homes, tower over viewers with seemingly monumental
authority. But there's something intimate about the 57-year-old
painter's abstract compositions, each of which is made up of
rectangular slabs of warm color stacked atop one another like blocks
of concrete. These approachable, unexpectedly forgiving works use the
larger-than-life-size scale of architecture to make a place for
sensitivity, delicacy and loveliness -- typically feminine attributes
that often embarrass artists who are afraid they'll make fools of
themselves if they don't put on a tough front.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Louver Gallery, Scully's first solo show on the West Coast
in 10 years includes six works on paper, three suites of photographs,
eight oils on linen and an enormous four-part painting. "Four Dark
Mirrors" doesn't dominate the main gallery so much as suffuse the
stark space with sensuous color and rhythmic movement.</TE>
<TE>   Each of its four parts is a diptych that measures 11 by 8 feet.
Each half contains from four to seven alternating horizontal bands of
two rich hues, such as navy blue and gold, crimson and ivory, or deep
forest green and silvery white. The striped sleeves of rugby jerseys
come to mind, as does the luxuriant palette of tastefully renovated
Old World hotels.</TE>
<TE>   But what's most impressive about Scully's huge painting is the
up-and-down thrust it sets into motion. Imagine the pistons of an
eight-cylinder engine slowed down to a glacial pace and you'll have a
sense of the steady movement pulsing through the painting. To stand
back and take it all in is to see that the Irish painter has
transformed right-angled geometry into fluid, serpentine swaying.</TE>
<TE>   From up close, each block of color's messy edges come into focus.
So do the bright layers of under-painting that peek through the gaps
and the sweeping strokes of Scully's brush, which he appears to have
used in the manner of a house painter racing to finish before the
rain starts. (Upstairs, a series of photographs depicts the exteriors
of weathered buildings in Merida, Mexico, again linking Scully's
abstractions to the labor of house painters.) But his work never
feels slapdash. Nor does it create the impression that you can see it
in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, his unfussy style embodies the casual confidence
that an individual brushstroke will not make or break a painting.
This attitude is also apparent in five watercolors and a big pastel
drawing, which emphasize the liquid, even atmospheric quality of
Scully's art.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, his single-panel paintings soften the swagger of
gestural abstraction with the everyday regularity of getting the job
done. Never precious, they give form to a kind of workaday
relaxation, of falling into a rhythm that produces wholes greater
than the sum of their parts. Although Scully is often made out to be
a heavyweight painter, the best thing about his works is their light
touch.</TE>

<TE>   A California artist who broke the rules</TE>
<TE>   Peter Voulkos is one of the most important artists to have come
out of California. His ceramic sculptures revolutionized a medium,
transformed art's relationship to craft (not to mention its
relationship to the rest of the world) and still influence
generations of artists. Almost single-handedly, Voulkos (1924-2002)
put California on the international art map as a place where the
rules do not apply.</TE>
<TE>   At Galerie Yoramgil, visitors step into this world. It's a place
where fearlessness and creativity are at home -- where vigorous
thrusts and muscular moves thrive alongside delicate touches and
quiet refinement. The small gallery is filled almost to overflowing
with 33 works made over the last 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Two large abstract paintings, "Big Bang" (1958) and "Passing Red"
(1959), nearly cover adjacent walls. Their rugged surfaces, which
resemble asphalt-covered roads ripped asunder by volcanic activity,
form a charged backdrop for the sculptures, vessels, plates and
prints that rest on pedestals, stand on the floor or hang on the
other walls.</TE>
<TE>   A long shelf on the back wall displays 11 tabletop pieces from the
early 1950s, including stoneware jugs, vases and bowls. These
gorgeously glazed works reveal Voulkos' keen eye for elegance and
grace, along with his love of funky interruptions and unpretentious
whimsy.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the next three decades is represented by only a few
pieces, but they're stunning examples of Voulkos' plate-like
sculptures. These round slabs of clay, which have been punched, torn
and abraded, look like the ancient ancestors of garbage-can lids or
the tops of caldrons used in industrial-strength kitchens. The holes
and bullet-shaped ceramic plugs in some cause them to resemble human
faces or the masks of oracles.</TE>
<TE>   The largest sculpture is "King's Chamber" (1992), a 3-foot-tall
mass of reddish copper clay that's both phallic and feminine, as
squat as a fireplug and infinitely more mysterious. A chimney emerges
from its stupa-shaped body, suggesting a prehistoric kiln in which
objects are subjected to hellish temperatures and regal ideas are
forged. That's what Voulkos did throughout his career, creating a
legendary body of work whose sensuous intelligence still sets the
standard by which other works are judged.</TE>
<TE>   Galerie Yoramgil, 319 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310)
275-8130, through Dec. 15. Closed Mondays.</TE>

<TE>   Women lost in their multimedia reveries</TE>
<TE>   "Girl on Girl" is a playful grab bag of paintings, sculptures,
drawings and photographs that artist Sherin Guirguis organized by
sending an e-mail to women whose work she liked and inviting them to
bring whatever they were working on. With a higher percentage of
pieces worth looking at than most group shows, the 19-artist
exhibition at Miller Durazo Contemporary Artists Projects
demonstrates that, when it comes to art, talent is more important
than management.</TE>
<TE>   In an art world increasingly administered by bureaucrats and
curators who think they're competing with the entertainment industry,
that's refreshing -- and a little rebellious.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the works in Guirguis' laissez-faire exhibition highlight
one of two types of devotion. The first involves long hours of labor
dedicated to getting a piece finished with sufficient polish. These
include Audra Weaser's sculpted paintings, Mikette Miller's nearly
monochrome photograph and Caroline Clerc's Space Age sculpture that
isn't afraid of being mistaken for the centerpiece of a fabulously
decorated table.</TE>
<TE>   The second group gives form to various obsessions. Based in the
fantasies of their makers, these scrappy works are less committed to
painstaking craftsmanship than to the pleasurable rhythms of
repetitious tasks. Suggesting long hours lost in reverie, they
include Alexis Weidig's spiraling wire tree filled with dozens of
tiny red birds, Emily Wagner's delicately drawn wonderland and Ruby
Osorio's dioramas made of paper cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   The best pieces combine craftsmanship and fantasy. In Pilar
Conde's synthetic wall sculpture, abstract icicles, an oil spill and
plastic lily pads depict a world in which artifice is just an
extension of the real thing. The same is true of Jane Callister's
painting of ornamental ooze, Amanda Farrar's gouache depicting an
imaginary anteater, Carrie Jenkin's sleek image of a bikini-clad babe
and Alisa Ochoa's homemade book, in which design tells the story so
well that words are obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, the exhibition's loose ends are its strengths. These
are works that prefer psychological complications to prepackaged
themes.</TE>

<HD>Harry Potter No. 5 preview is on the block</HD>
<DH>With the book still in the works, author J.K. Rowling has
signed a 93-word outline that Sotheby's will auction off for charity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Wardell</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>How much is someone willing to pay to find out what happens to boy
wizard Harry Potter in the next installment of his adventures?</LD>
<LD>   Sotheby's auction house figures about $9,400.</LD>
<LD>   That is its estimated price for a 93-word handwritten document by
author J.K. Rowling that reveals the outline of the plot of "Harry
Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."</LD>
<TE>   Sotheby's has released a teaser of the highly prized document,
which alludes to "Ron ... broom ... sacked ... house-elf ... new ...
teacher ... dies ... sorry."</TE>
<TE>   The autographed statement is titled "Edinburgh 2002 -- Things I
can tell you about 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.' "</TE>
<TE>   The other 69 words written by Rowling about the eagerly awaited
fifth Harry Potter book will only be disclosed to the buyer, who must
purchase the paper sight unseen at the Dec. 12 auction.</TE>
<TE>   The publicity-shy Rowling agreed to the sale to raise money for
Book Aid International, a charity that supplies books to the
developing world.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Potter fans have grown increasingly curious about the fate
of their hero as the author has declined to publicly select a release
date for "The Order of the Phoenix."</TE>
<TE>   The first Harry Potter book, published in 1997, was "Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone" -- released in the United States as
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The second and third volumes
followed over the next two years, and the fourth, the mammoth "Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire," appeared in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This naturally raised hopes that the fifth would follow at the
same rate. But two summers have passed without a sign of Harry and
his magic pals reappearing.</TE>
<TE>   Rowling has repeatedly denied she is suffering from writer's block
and said there was never any intention of publishing the fifth book
in 2001. The author, who married anesthetist Neil Murray, 31, last
year, is expecting a baby; she has a 9-year-old daughter, Jessica,
from her previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, fans will have to make do with revisiting earlier
installments in print and on film.</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," the second movie in the
series, opened a week ago.</TE>

<HD>German police on Jackson case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German police said Thursday they would examine whether Michael
Jackson committed a crime by dangling his baby from a fourth-floor
hotel window in Berlin in front of fans.</LD>
<LD>   "We are examining if there is cause to open an investigation into
whether a crime was committed," said Berlin police spokeswoman
Christine Rother after the incident was captured on film and then
widely broadcast in Germany and around the world.</LD>
<LD>   She said if it turned out there was suspicion of parental "neglect
of duty in respect of care and supervision," a formal investigation
into Tuesday's incident would be started.</LD>
<TE>   Rother declined to say how the inquiry would be conducted or
whether Jackson would be questioned by police. The entertainer, who
was in Berlin to receive an award, could not be reached for comment.
He apologized earlier in the week.</TE>

control what they put into programs, exhibitions and other
activities.</LD>
<LD>   "A museum's governing authority and staff must ensure that no
individual benefits at the expense of the museum's mission,
reputation or the community it serves," the guidelines say.</LD>

<HD>A 'Tempest' that's too young at heart</HD>
<DH>The cast is up for the athletic demands, but playing
multiple roles works against East West Players production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The seven actors in Andrew Tsao's staging of Shakespeare's "The
Tempest" for East West Players are onstage as the audience enters,
stretching and warming up, wearing simple modern outfits that are
suitable for a physical workout.</LD>
<LD>   And a workout this cast gets. This is a very gymnastic "Tempest."
Not only do the actors tumble and climb ropes and rapidly hoist
themselves between two levels throughout the production, but six of
the seven play at least two roles. So there aren't many opportunities
to take a backstage breather, especially because there is no
intermission in Tsao's spare, 95-minute version of the text.</LD>
<LD>   All that athleticism makes for some vigorous choreography,
credited to Nick Erickson. But it also apparently required a youthful
cast, and this is a problem. There should be a clear delineation
between the generations in the human characters of "The Tempest."</LD>
<TE>   Prospero (Daniel Dae Kim) has been restlessly trapped on his
island for years, while his contemporaries have usurped his place on
the mainland. The younger generation -- Prospero's daughter, Miranda,
and her newfound lover, Ferdinand -- should be a breath of fresh air
as they encounter the "brave new world."</TE>
<TE>   Yet here all look as if they're about the same age, give or take
five or six years. Kim and the other actors playing the older roles
speak their lines well enough, but their delivery doesn't carry the
weight of their experience.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the fact that the cast is introduced to us as actors who
are warming up, not as their characters, signals that we shouldn't
take this production too literally. It's all make-believe -- which
also helps justify the fact that nearly everyone has more than one
role.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. But if a company wants to do small-cast,
stripped-down Shakespeare, "The Tempest" isn't one of the better
choices. It's set entirely outdoors, on an enchanted island. It cries
out for big production values and effects.</TE>
<TE>   Here, Rand Ryan's lighting and Nathan Wang's sound design and
score work overtime to create some of those effects, but Victoria
Petrovich's set and Steven N. Lee's costumes remain fairly
rudimentary in terms of creating enchantment, serving primarily to
facilitate the actors' gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Tsao staged an alfresco "Tempest," for Shakespeare
Festival/LA, at the Watercourt in downtown L.A. But the location
didn't work out. The site's fountains weren't used, distracting noise
filtered in from other sources, and the design of the production
oddly suggested an indoor theater in the days of vaudeville rather
than the great outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Tsao probably didn't want to repeat himself, but that vaudevillian
imagery would have fit much better inside East West's theater. Or,
alternatively, this production could have emphasized island imagery
in keeping with the Pacific Islands part of East West's
Asian-Pacific-American mission. As it is, specific Asian-Pacific
references are readily apparent only in one costume (Gonzalo's), in
the use of a Chinese zither in Wang's score, and in a few images of
swirling fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Yang King does the most chameleonic double duty as he
switches between the character who is the play's homeliest, Caliban,
and the character who is the play's handsome young stud, Ferdinand.
The transformations of his female counterpart, Gwendoline Yeo,
between the roles of Miranda and Ariel are a little more subtle. Yeo
also takes on a third role as the player of that Chinese zither
that's off to one side of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Trieu Tran and the distinctively limber Ogie Zulueta have fun with
the lowlifes Stephano and Trinculo, but they look more callow than
anyone else on stage when they play the older generation's Sebastian
and Antonio.</TE>

<HD>The splendor of the season</HD>
<DH>It might be balmy here, but the Southland's trees know a
thing or two about head-turning fall displays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Smaus</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the remnants of New England's famously colorful fall foliage
now lie buried beneath the snow and ice, fall is coming into its own
right here, probably on a street near you.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California can't compete with New England's fiery oranges
and reds, or even the gold that flows down the mountain gullies of
the Eastern Sierra, but the landscape better-known for its palms also
knows how to turn a fall leaf or two.</LD>
<LD>   In the San Fernando Valley, streets are lined with golden Modesto
ash, red crape myrtles or bronzy zelkovas. Individual specimens of
bright orange pistache, an ornamental relative of the nut-bearing
tree, dot the hills and sides of freeways.</LD>
<TE>   In Canyon Country and Acton, the yellow on Lombardy poplars and
other deciduous trees can be blinding, although their autumn is
almost over.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the Southland, the show has barely begun. In some
areas, trees will continue to color up well into December.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena and the San Gabriel Valley, one finds avenues of
brightly colored liquidambar, the rather dirty yellow of tipu trees
and some spectacular golden ginkgo. Ginkgo will often color
surprisingly well in the mildest areas, such as Fullerton, or
Lakewood. Both have streets lined with this ancient tree.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best trees to turn color -- the real fall foliage
factories -- are seldom planted on streets, although they can
occasionally be spotted in frontyards. Two of the most dramatic are
the Chinese tallow tree (Sapium) and the sour gum (Nyssa), which turn
yellow to orange to bright red before their leaves finally flutter
down.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of leaves to color canyons, as a drive through
Topanga will show. Accentuating the gold of the sycamores are the
dabs of bright yellow on the shrubby willows, which also cling to
creek banks.</TE>
<TE>   The most common by far of the dozen or so street trees that
reliably color up is the liquidambar -- which, despite its handsome
looks, has its detractors: It drops spiny round seed pods and has
roots that make it a champion sidewalk-lifter.</TE>
<TE>   In Donald R. Hodel's book "Exceptional Trees of Los Angeles"
(California Arboretum Foundation, 1988), he singled out a planting of
liquidambar on Ross Avenue in Alhambra as having exceptional size and
fall color. The ones on Westwood Boulevard south of Pico Boulevard in
West Los Angeles positively glow when backlit by the sun. Keith
Lenik, manager at Boething Treeland Nursery in Woodland Hills, has a
number of favorite street trees for fall color in the Valley, such as
the zelkovas (related to elms) that line Platt Avenue near Oxnard
Street in West Hills, or the bright yellow Modesto ash on Canoga
Avenue between Burbank Boulevard and Oxnard, or the crape myrtles on
Fallbrook Avenue, or on Shoup Avenue between Victory and Ventura
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Other trees that might be found along streets in the Valley
include the Chinese flame and flamegold (both Koelreuteria), which
turn bright yellow some years and are probably better-known for their
salmon-colored seed pods. These are common in parts of West L.A. and
Orange County as well.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the tulip trees (Liriodendron) -- commonly found in
the Valley -- although Hodel says it was in Whittier that he found
the most spectacular planting of this tree, in the 5400 block of
Rockne Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Few trees turn color as reliably as the bright, golden-yellow
ginkgo. Its leaves remain gold even after lying on the ground for
days, or even weeks. Walking down a sidewalk littered with ginkgo
leaves, kicking them into the air as you plow though them, is quite a
treat.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are ginkgoes all over (the tree has been around
since Jurassic times), the most impressive one Hodel found is in the
1100 block of North Palomares Street in Pomona. He says it's most
colorful around the first of December.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Burkard at Burkard Nurseries in Pasadena says his favorite
place to see ginkgoes is on Lombardy Road, just east of Allen Avenue
near the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens
in San Marino. These trees are the variety "Autumn Gold," which lives
up to its name and is a good choice for larger home gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Ginkgoes will even produce fabulous color in areas that don't get
close to being cold.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Van Diest with the Fullerton Arboretum says there's a
handsome planting on Cornell Avenue between Chapman and Commonwealth
avenues in Fullerton. Hodel says there's a planting that's still
rather young but quite colorful on Hayter Avenue near Michelson
Street in his hometown of Lakewood. There are even individual trees
near the beach in places such as Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   As you drive around this fall and discover good foliage on the
streets of Southern California, remember that not much of what you
see is suitable for the average garden. The best and most majestic
street trees grow too large and get too greedy and aggressive for
most gardens.</TE>
<TE>   If you do see a type of tree that you want to add to your yard,
this is the time to get it, because you will see it at its autumn
best. That way, you can choose a particular tree for its colorful
leaves -- fall foliage can vary tremendously from tree to tree.</TE>
<TE>   Even in New England.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Finding fall color</TE>
<TE>   Where to go:</TE>
<TE>   For street trees, look in areas with cooler fall temperatures,
such as the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>
<TE>   For backyard trees, visit botanical gardens and arboretums, such
as the Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia, or the Huntington
Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, or
Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge. Nurseries often will gather
the best fall foliage producers and put them front and center while
they are in color.</TE>
<TE>   Trees to look for on streets:</TE>
<TE>   Liquidambar, tulip trees (Liriodendron), golden Modesto ash, red
crepe myrtles, bronzy zelkovas, orange pistache, Chinese flame and
flamegold (both Koelreuteria), and ginkgoes.</TE>
<TE>   Trees to look for in gardens:</TE>
<TE>   Chinese tallow tree (Sapium), sour gum (Nyssa), ornamental pears,
pomegranate and persimmon.</TE>

<LD>The first image of Charles Phoenix's "God Bless Americana: The Retro
Holiday Slide Show" at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theatre
is a young matron perfectly poised before her festooned tree, like
Carol Merrill on "Let's Make a Deal."</LD>
<LD>   Between this, and the Goodyear Christmas compilation wafting from
the speakers, the sense of baby-boomer nostalgia is acute before the
show begins.</LD>
<LD>   Then our host arrives, launching his latest edition of kitsch
archeology with a confession: "I am an addict, and you are all my
enablers." This is both simple accuracy and a massive understatement.</LD>
<TE>   A younger Silver Lake version of Garrison Keillor, "histo-tainer"
Phoenix is a lifelong retro junkie. For a decade, he has collected
vintage photographic slides, favoring the 1940s through the 1960s.
This passion has since evolved into his unique, wildly funny novelty
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The scattershot structure traverses the calendar year, accompanied
by Phoenix's rambling, spontaneous commentary. Pulling facts from the
slide notations, his eagle eye spots the tiniest details. When these
land, as in two sisters dressed identically to their decor, the
effect is priceless.</TE>
<TE>   The more subversive potential is scarcely developed. Phoenix
simply notes a roomful of cigarette smokers beside an infant, or the
recurring toted guns, without shaping any theatrical overview.
Nevertheless, both tour and guide offer fine entertainment, the
perfect diversion to get those visiting relatives off your couch.</TE>

<TE>   Bright lights, drag city</TE>
<TE>   The strangely bewitching country singers -- who have lacy ruffles
upon their bosoms and hair piled as high as any Appalachian mountain
-- are just a few chords into their first a cappella harmony when an
extraordinary sound issues from the smallest and daintiest of the
quartet. It is a resonant bass, produced as only a man can.</TE>
<TE>   That's because these Dixie chicks are actually guys, appearing at
the Celebration Theatre in the country-bluegrass drag musical
"She-Haw in Howdy Hollywood." Like the squeaky-clean boys of "Forever
Plaid," the slightly soiled girls of "She-Haw" arrive on the wings of
a show-business dream. Their hourlong program recounts a westward
migration from the rural South to the bright lights of Los Angeles.
Recollections hopscotch from men loved and lost (in such songs as
"Gonorrhea" and "Untie My Man") to musical influences (such as Dolly
Parton, in "Those Mammaries") to "Hee-Haw"-like tributes to cities
visited along the way (including Laguna Beach and the physical
splendors of a "Bubble Butted Boogie Boy").</TE>
<TE>   The melodies are instantly recognizable as hits by everyone from
Tammy Wynette to the Oak Ridge Boys, given slightly scandalous
sound-alike lyrics that earn appreciative roars of laughter from the
Celebration's largely gay and lesbian audience.</TE>
<TE>   This off-kilter humor is the strongest suit of a show written and
performed by Chantilly Demoisier (Mark Salyer), S'fonda Hicks (Philip
Edwards), Etta Mame (Kleev Guessford) and, most memorably, the
adorable, pigtailed bass, Crystal Chandelier (Neal Allen Hyde).
Although director Randee Trabitz, choreographer Beau Puckett and
costumer Richard Bostard have attempted to give this high camp a high
gloss, the proceedings retain a charmingly rough-around-the edges
quality thanks to fumbled lines, toppled wigs and precarious,
platform-heeled movements.</TE>
<TE>   It's all perfectly mindless, but if you're in a silly enough mood,
it's also gosh-darn fun.</TE>

<TE>   Round and round the roundelay</TE>
<TE>   "Temporary doesn't mean brief." These words form the crux of
"Sleeping Around," receiving its U.S. premiere at the Rude Guerrilla
Theater Company in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Fannin, Stephen Greenhorn, Abi Morgan and Mark Ravenhill's
1998 update of Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 "Reigen" (better known as "La
Ronde") explores the infinite depths within transitory human
intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Like David Hare's 1998 counterpart "The Blue Room," "Sleeping"
charts a coital round robin, with each new partner carrying forward
to the next coupling, coming full circle by the finale. Unlike "Blue
Room," however, "Sleeping" probes the emotional recesses of its
characters, harvesting more humor and sexual voltage than Hare's
socioeconomic emphasis achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Barton's direction is strong and the designs are resourceful,
especially Dawn Hess' dank lighting. Though the play was conceived
for two actors playing all the roles, Barton casts the parts
individually, for maximum contrast and intensity.</TE>
<TE>   The physically fearless ensemble includes Deborah Conroy, Paul
Nicholson, Kelly Quigley, Steven Parker, Johnna Adams, Craig Johnson,
Michelle Bylenga, Bryan Jennings, Lynne Harris, Aurelio Locsin, Julie
Jagusiak and Keith Bennett. All 12 display convincing dialects and
notable commitment.</TE>
<TE>   This is fortunate, for the alternately scabrous and poetic
vignettes lack a consistently unified voice, a liability of multiple
authorship. While this doesn't prohibit interest, it does permit
detachment, rather like a BBC version of "Berlin Alexanderplatz."</TE>

<TE>   Vicious cycle exposed in 'complications'</TE>
<TE>   AIDS has ushered in a language of "complications," cataloging the
long list of ailments to which HIV-infected bodies are vulnerable.
Michael Kearns borrows from this lexicon to suggest that life itself
rarely comes without complications.</TE>
<TE>   Presented at Highways Performance Space, his new play, which he
calls "complications," is a series of monologues by nine characters
linked through sexual encounters.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns performs the first monologue, about a man who idolizes
Jackie Kennedy for her ability to face grief with dignity. Having had
to endure the deaths of several lovers, he has frequently turned to
her example.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the subsequent characters are also gay, some are
HIV-positive and several are non-white. Society misunderstands and
fears them, and the resulting alienation has poisoned their ability
to give or receive love. (In order, they are portrayed by Joe
Quintero, Steve Callahan, Nick Salamone, Joe Gill, Jimmy Shaw, Dean
Howell, Syd Rushing and Alisa Melendrez.)</TE>
<TE>   Isolated in tightly focused pools of light, the actors have only
their voices and bodies to work with. Kearns, who also serves as the
show's director, makes sure that every inflection speaks volumes.</TE>
<TE>   As always, Kearns -- a prominent chronicler of gay life and AIDS
-- comes up with inventive characterizations and vivid wordplay. But
"complications" feels unfinished, with at times heavy-handed plotting
and a too-abrupt ending. Nevertheless, the piece exposes a vicious
cycle and challenges America to break out of it.</TE>

<TE>   "complications," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa
Monica. Sunday and Dec. 1, 4 p.m. $15. (310) 315-1459. Running time:

<TE>   Snaring Dodgers: A plodding tale</TE>
<TE>   History doesn't exactly leap off the page in Greg Suddeth's "Bums
Luck," which is too bad, since the events he chronicles are of
enduring interest.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back to the late 1950s, Suddeth tries to recapture the
spirit of a still-provincial Los Angeles that is eager to prove
itself a world-class city. A major league baseball team would go a
long way toward cementing that reputation, and Brooklyn Dodgers owner
Walter O'Malley is willing to be wooed. The at-times hard-hitting
game required to bring his team west is the topic of this world
premiere presentation by Blue Sphere Alliance at the Lex Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The starting lineup includes several names that still resonate
throughout the city. Mayor Norris Poulson (Tim Ryan) is portrayed
here as a blustery sort who can barely sit still when he gets
agitated -- and as roadblocks are thrown in his way, he gets agitated
a lot. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn (Christian Lyon), on the other hand,
works tirelessly and good-naturedly on the deal, then wrestles
mightily with his conscience when he realizes that building a stadium
in Chavez Ravine will mean evicting the families who live there.</TE>
<TE>   Working shoulder to shoulder with them is City Councilwoman Roz
Wyman (a coolly elegant, commanding Leigh Kelly), who has earned a
place at the table in a '50s America that still doesn't take women
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley, alas, comes across as a standard-issue fat cat, in a
halting performance by Earl Carroll. A still bigger problem is that
the history Suddeth recounts is, essentially, a grinding of
government gears: City Council votes, citywide referendums and
endless politicking. He hasn't found a way to make that dynamic.
Serving as his own director, Suddeth further saps energy by leaving
too much dead time between the many short scenes.</TE>
<TE>   It's back to training camp for this show, in hopes it can emerge
stronger in some future season.</TE>

<TE>   Lessons buried in 'American Tract'</TE>
<TE>   While in search of a better life for herself and her children, the
central character in "An American Tract" almost loses touch with the
one she already has.</TE>
<TE>   Worthy lessons are buried deep in Barbara White Morgan's play,
first presented in 1988, about an African American family's move into
an exclusive white neighborhood. But these points are rather
difficult to extract from the contrived, overstuffed script, which
rambles on still longer in a slackly paced revival by Towne Street
Theatre at the Raven Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Single mother Anne Jackson (Teressa Taylor), a convalescent
caregiver, can't believe her good fortune when she inherits the home
from a deceased patient. Her older boy (Jarreau James) has already
slipped into gangs, and the younger one (Christopher Richardson) is
at a vulnerable age. She believes they'll thrive away from the inner
city, but their conformity-minded suburb presents a new set of
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   A bit too coincidentally, the Jacksons find themselves sandwiched
between a family of social liberals (Darrell Phillip, Amy Hayes,
Melinda Lively and Alex Sanders) and a sourpuss who barely bothers to
conceal his bigotry (Ken Zavayna). The resulting interactions must
fight for focus with too many ancillary plotlines.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Fegan's staging strands the actors in awkward groupings, and
the performances are wildly uneven. Fortunately, Taylor's performance
as the mother grounds the production in genuine emotion, while
Richardson as the younger son and Lively as the oh, so chipper
neighbor girl provide much-needed laughs.</TE>

<LD>"Done skating already?" Mr. Sonderquist asked when he saw me on the
bench.</LD>
<LD>   " 'I'm waiting for Rolf to take me home,' I said, and before I
knew it my eyes filled with tears. 'I'm not any good at skating.'</LD>

were plenty of times when I went inside the farmhouse, freezing and
wanting to give up.</TE>

<HD>'Friday' dawns anew, full of zesty raunch</HD>
<DH>Ice Cube returns in a third installment of the comedy,
which is as outrageous as ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hilarious, rowdy "Friday After Next" finds its writer and
co-producer Ice Cube returning as Craig, the likable if not overly
responsible hero of its predecessors, "Friday" (1995), which helped
launch Chris Tucker, and "Next Friday" (2000), which introduced a new
sidekick, Day-Day (Mike Epps), Craig's headstrong cousin.</LD>
<LD>   Fast and raunchy, "Friday After Next" surely stands apart from
other holiday-themed movies for its gleeful low-down humor and a raft
of uninhibited characters involved in one outrageous predicament
after another.</LD>
<LD>   It's the night before Christmas Eve in South-Central L.A. and,
sure enough, the Santa Claus Robber hits Craig and Day-Day's
apartment in the seedy Shady Palms, a classic Atomic Age structure.
Along with their CDs, Santa makes off with a speaker containing their
rent money. Their landlady, Ms. Pearly (BeBe Drake), for whom the
description no-nonsense is woefully inadequate, was already about to
evict them, and now her son Damon (Terry Crews), fresh out of the pen
after spending 12 years lifting weights, is on hand to back her up.</LD>
<TE>   The guys scare up security jobs at a nearby strip mall, where
Craig's father, Willie (John Witherspoon), and Day-Day's father,
Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have just opened a barbecue joint. Although
armed with only a police-style whistle, Day-Day goes power-mad,
seeing himself as "a top-flight security officer," setting off a
domino effect of disasters and shenanigans that carry on to Christmas
Eve, the deadline for the cousins to come up with their rent money.</TE>
<TE>   The constant flow of calamities spotlights a lot of talented and
funny people under music video veteran Marcus Raboy's buoyant,
good-natured direction. Among them: Anna Maria Horsford as Willie's
swiftly jealous wife; K.D. Aubert as Donna, the gorgeous saleswoman
at a mall shop run by a diminutive but classically flashy pimp (Katt
Williams); and Maz Jobrani as the cousins' excitable employer (and
proprietor of the mall's doughnut shop, the Holy Moly).</TE>
<TE>   Production designer Amy B. Ancona's choice of authentically gritty
locales and vivid interiors and Dana Campbell's exuberant costumes,
plus a zesty soundtrack, contribute strongly to bringing "Friday
After Next" alive.</TE>

<LD>If you hear a tremendous thud tonight around 8, don't be overly
alarmed. It's just the career of Bryant Gumbel making a rather
pointless landing on Planet Geraldo, a strange place where dubious
investigative projects are king, and from which few former newsmen
have ever returned with their credibility intact.</LD>
<LD>   Gumbel, the longtime host of NBC's "Today" franchise and more
recently "The Morning Show" on CBS, is at the helm of a two-hour Sci
Fi Channel special, "The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence." Like
Geraldo Rivera's unforgettable 1986 foray into Al Capone's vault,
tonight's program purports to blow the lid off the 1947 crash of
something or other in the New Mexico desert.</LD>
<LD>   Why now? Well, after more than half a century of government-sworn
silence by military personnel, during which time local townspeople
were allegedly threatened with prison or worse if they told what they
knew, lips are loosening. One resident reveals that he actually saw
"an object" at the crash site. "It was gray," he explains. "But a
weird gray."</LD>
<TE>   As earth-shattering as that and other revelations tonight might
be, the reason for the show's timing appears to lie more in the realm
of TV programming than scientific discovery. The Sci Fi Channel
follows the "Roswell" special with more UFO fodder in "Abduction
Diaries" at 10 p.m., and both shows are an attempt to generate buzz
for the channel's Dec. 2 launch of "Steven Spielberg's Taken," a
miniseries the cable channel is counting on to churn up some
out-of-this-world ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But "The Roswell Crash" gets the publicity push off to a weak
start despite the Sci Fi Channel's claims about "smoking gun"
evidence revealed in the final 20 minutes. These folks are shooting
blanks.</TE>

<HD>An elegant story of corruptibility</HD>
<DH>Michael Caine carries 'The Quiet American,' set in French
colonial Vietnam in 1952.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graham Greene's spirit hovers over "The Quiet American," the new
version of his prescient 1955 novel, like a shrewd and dispassionate
ghost. Star Michael Caine, who gives one of the great, inescapably
moving performances in a career filled with them, based his character
on personal impressions of the late author. And Greene's lifelong
concern with moral ambiguity gives this film a texture and complexity
that movies don't usually achieve.</LD>
<LD>   No one today is writing books quite like Greene, the author of
"The Third Man," "The Comedians," "Our Man in Havana" and two dozen
more, novels known for their elegant writing and their deft, almost
casual mixture of dramatically compelling plots and profound issues.</LD>
<LD>   Set in Vietnam circa 1952, at a time when the French were the
embattled colonial power we later became, "The Quiet American" is
about the corruptibility, not the more typical transcendence, of the
human spirit; about how easy it is to become tainted and complicit;
about how even a cynic has innocence to lose, and even an innocent
can do terrible harm.</LD>
<TE>   Australian director Phillip Noyce, best known for major Hollywood
action thrillers ("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger"), has
returned to the tone of his earlier, more human-scale works like
"Heatwave" and "Newsfront." "The Quiet American" is a graceful,
contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world
where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   Noyce and his cast -- Caine as skeptical British journalist Thomas
Fowler, Brendan Fraser as the dangerously idealistic American of the
title, and Do Thi Hai Yen as the stunning Vietnamese woman they both
love -- are helped by a script that was touched by many hands but
ended up elegantly written and very much in the Greene spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Credited to Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan, "The Quiet
American" performs numerous nips and tucks to the novel's plot, but
none that seriously affect the thrust of the piece. It's safe to say
that Greene, who was said to be furious at the way the 1958 Audie
Murphy and Michael Redgrave version (written and directed by Joseph
L. Mankiewicz) distorted the book's unhappiness with Americans, would
be much more pleased with the current effort.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is set in Vietnam before the U.S. got involved on an
earthshaking scale, Greene's novel is extremely discerning about what
it is in the American character -- the messianic zeal, the sureness
of being right -- that made what came later inevitable. Its message
(characterized by the novel's opening Byron quote about an "age of
new inventions / For killing bodies, and for saving souls, / All
propagated with the best intentions") couldn't be more relevant as we
get ready to storm into yet another troubled country very far away.</TE>
<TE>   Should this sound too serious, don't forget that it was Greene's
gift, shared by the film, to clothe these concerns in compelling
drama. It also helps to have the fluid Christopher Doyle, the
cinematographer of choice for many Asian directors (most notably Wong
Kar Wai for "In the Mood for Love"), behind the camera. Doyle is
adept at capturing both the chaos of Saigon street life and the
country's parallel mystery and delicate beauty.</TE>
<TE>   The man with the best intentions is a bright and idealistic
32-year-old American economic aid worker, Alden Pyle (Fraser). He's
described in the novel as someone "determined to do good, not to any
individual person but to a country, a continent, a world," with the
narrator waspishly adding, "God save us always from the innocent and
the good."</TE>
<TE>   That skeptical narrator is seen-it-all British journalist Fowler
(Caine), an old Vietnam hand who prides himself on his dispassion. "I
don't get involved," he tells Pyle, who cultivates the older man's
friendship to get to know the lay of the land. "I just report what I
see."</TE>
<TE>   Fowler is not so old that he doesn't have a beautiful Vietnamese
mistress, Phuong, with whom Pyle falls in love literally at first
sight. As Fowler's graceful voice-over puts it, "Saving a country and
saving a woman would be the same thing to him."</TE>
<TE>   Fowler is at a disadvantage in this contest because he has a wife
in England who won't divorce him, and Phuong has an unromantic,
avaricious sister who sees Pyle as a prime catch. As the relationship
drama plays out, the American gets increasingly involved with what he
calls a "third force," a putatively democratic alternative to both
communism and colonialism headed by the mysterious Gen. The.</TE>
<TE>   It is the nature of Greene's plots that no one is as they seem and
the world stands revealed as a more complex place than anyone
anticipated. It's not just, as the novel has Fowler say of Pyle, that
"I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he
caused," it's that everyone's motives and actions get called into
question.</TE>
<TE>   This is a story about the mutability of acting well and acting
badly, about how easy it is to cross that line, a story that
underlines the impossibility of staying neutral and the inevitability
of taking sides.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fraser, cast to type as the square-shouldered American with a
felled-ox quality, and the quietly enigmatic Do, seen in Tran Anh
Hung's lovely "The Vertical Ray of the Sun," do impeccable supporting
work here, but finally this film succeeds as well as it does because
of Caine.</TE>
<TE>   A veteran of more than 100 TV dramas and some 80 theatrical films,
Caine gives the kind of seemingly effortless performance it needs an
entire career to prepare for. With a face that has known a thousand
compromises, and a world of regret in his every gesture, Caine's
Fowler, open to tears, to rage, to disappointment as well as love,
seems actually to have the character's life. Caine's performance is
intricate without seeming to be, a nuanced marvel of the actor's
craft.</TE>

<LD>The light was beginning to wane in the Century Plaza Hotel late
Tuesday afternoon, and Al and Tipper Gore, the ex-vice president and
presidential candidate and his always-present wife, were late. Late
for everything.</LD>
<LD>   Their plane from New York had been delayed, and in half an hour
they had to be in a CNN studio with Larry King, across town, to plug
their new book. After that they would be signing copies for two hours
at the Brentano's bookstore in Century City (where people had started
lining up at 5 a.m.). At 7 a.m. the next morning, they would be on
the "Today" show.</LD>
<LD>   Al and Tipper Gore were also hungry. They hadn't eaten all day. So
it was between hurried bites of matching salmon salads that this
impossibly functional couple, the models of successful suburban
marriage and healthy middle-aged sexuality in one of the most
dysfunctional White Houses ever -- who had the unfortunate job of
playing straight men to Bill and Hillary's honeymooners -- talked
about successful marriages and healthy sex lives.</LD>
<TE>   Ostensibly, anyway. One got the impression that they'd been
talking about that too much. By this point in the day, the Gores
wanted to cut up -- as usual, together. When the point was raised
that the book would inevitably be seen as an early campaign screed,
the first salvo for 2004, the Gores demurred: "I can assure you," Al
said, "that if I'd set out in January of 2000 to develop an intricate
strategy to run again, I wouldn't have done it by spending two years
preparing a couple of books on family."</TE>
<TE>   "We would have been out there, raising tons of money," Tipper
added.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't we just talk about Iraq?" joked Al, referring to his
appearance earlier that day on the national radio talk show "Fresh
Air." The host, Terry Gross, had shown little interest in anything
else. "Did they leave in the part when Tipper asked Terry whether
she'd even read the book?" They had.</TE>
<TE>   The book, "Joined at the Heart: The Transformation of the American
Family," is a labor of -- what else? -- love for the Gores, a project
11 years in the researching and two very intimate years in the
writing. "Our desks faced each other -- we were literally joined at
the wood, I guess you could say," Tipper said. "And I have a master's
degree in psychology, so I could analyze him all the time."</TE>
<TE>   "Joined at the Heart," equal parts self-help tome, family-therapy
diary and dissertation, is a work of, at the very least, sincerity.
Sentences like "The drive to form families is as essential today as
it was 130,000 years ago on the African Savannah" and "Tipper
remembers some of the complicated emotions of being a stepchild"
follow each other.</TE>
<TE>   It has that classic Gore self-possession (who invented the
Internet?), but a lot of statistics too. Some critics will doubtless
quip that it has a little too much Gore. "Growing up in a political
family, family stories tend to be made public," Al said. "The day
after I was born, the Nashville Tennessean ran a front-page story on
it because my father was on the phone with a reporter when it
happened."</TE>
<TE>   "We ..." Tipper began.</TE>
<TE>   "We could hardly leave ourselves out of the book," Al interjected.
"Excuse me," Tipper said. "I was talking. Talk about putting yourself
at the center of things."</TE>
<TE>   "You see, we're not perfect -- we're having a big fight in front
of you," Al said. "And we're not claiming to be experts," Tipper
continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I talk now?" Al blurted out.The book is also full of
grievous, sometimes even horrific stories of family travails. Typical
of the Harvard graduate, it is not light reading. "Writing this," Al
said, "I became utterly convinced that if you take any American
family, no matter how seemingly normal, and if you dig beneath the
surface, you will find the most incredible things."</TE>
<TE>   "Joined at the Heart" is accompanied by a book of photography,
"The Spirit of Family," which the Gores, both former journalists,
edited. It too manages to combine touchy-feely vanity-project
boilerplate ("Love, like gravity, is always there, holding us
securely in place," reads the introduction) with candid grittiness.
There are even a few decidedly risque shots. Page 34 is occupied by a
young, apparently nude couple consorting in what appears to be a
public restroom, and on 37 a young woman poses in her underwear, no
family members in sight. "Doesn't that shot go great with the quote?"
Al said of a Thomas Hardy quotation on the facing page: "Childlike, I
danced in a dream; Blessings emblazoned that day; Everything glowed
with a gleam; Yet we were looking away." Does Al worry they might
turn off Barnes &amp; Noble browsers in the Bible Belt? "Part of the life
cycle of a family is that people meet and people become intimate. I
don't think that's a particularly scandalous picture, but if you do,
by all means describe it that way. It might help sales."</TE>

<HD>Understudy Mulligan Ready for His Big Role</HD>
<DH>Money man has been quietly working on a deal that would
give him Barry Diller's job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian C. Mulligan is digging in for the battle of his professional
life: He wants Barry Diller's job.</LD>
<LD>   Mulligan is the mastermind behind oil tycoon Marvin Davis'
$13-billion bid for control of Vivendi Universal's studios, theme
parks, cable channels and recording labels. Associates say that
Mulligan could take the operational reins now held by Diller if a
deal is reached.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the showy Diller, Mulligan is a subdued, hard-working
Hollywood money man who has resided on the edges of the top jobs that
turn mortals into moguls.</LD>
<TE>   He once served as co-chairman of Universal Studios and chief
financial officer of Seagram Co. Last year, after only nine months on
the job, Mulligan left under duress as chairman of News Corp.'s Fox
Television, where he oversaw cable channels, TV stations and Fox
Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say he was unable to fit into the cutthroat,
entrepreneurial culture that is News Corp.'s trademark. From the
beginning, associates say, he was seen as an easy mark because he was
new to the TV business. His underlings waged a virtual mutiny,
refusing to return his phone calls and challenging his authority,
according to Fox executives.</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old Mulligan declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Because his reputation is as a deal maker, rather than an
operations manager, some question whether he has the leadership
skills to run a major corporation. They say he seems to recognize
that the fastest way for him to reach those heights is for Davis to
buy Universal's entertainment group, owner of the world's largest
music company, a leading movie studio and a television operation that
includes the "Law and Order" franchise as well as the USA and Sci-Fi
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Few know the Universal assets better than Mulligan, who lives in
La Canada with his wife and two young children.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Universal in 1991 as a 30-year-old whiz kid controller.
Well liked, he quickly rose through the ranks, doing stints in
finance, corporate development and finally as the legendary studio's
co-chairman. In 1999, he became chief financial officer of Seagram
Co., which by then had purchased Universal from Matsushita Electric
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan and Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr. negotiated the sale
of Seagram to Vivendi. The new owners brought in their own management
team, leaving Mulligan with few choices. He left one month later with
four years left on his lucrative contract. His options package alone
was valued at more than $20 million at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people have anywhere near the knowledge that Brian has
of USA, the music group and the studio," said Blair Westlake, the
former chairman of Universal Television who has known Mulligan since
his earliest days at the company.</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan began thinking about the takeover this summer after media
reports that Vivendi might be forced to sell entertainment assets to
reduce its debt. Friends say he contacted several private equity
funds and financiers with entertainment backgrounds. One of them was
Davis, a former owner of the 20th Century Fox Studio who still owns
broadcast stations.</TE>
<TE>   The two met for the first time in August at Davis' Los Angeles
offices. Mulligan described his vision for the takeover, the
potential hurdles and solutions and the long-term prospects. Davis
signed on, sending a formal proposal to Vivendi's French owners the
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Mulligan met with top Vivendi executives in Paris
to press Davis' case. For the moment, the company is saying only that
the sale is "not on the agenda." Another meeting has been scheduled
for January.</TE>
<TE>   Many people at Universal are privately rooting for Mulligan.
Diller is bearing down hard on costs, forcing the studio to conserve
money by selling off certain rights to outside partners. He is
expected to continue slashing overhead to ready the unit for a public
offering.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Worth more?</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Davis is said to value Vivendi's entertainment businesses
at about $20 billion, but some analysts put the value as high as $26
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' estimated value of Vivendi's entertainment assets (in
billions)</TE>
<TE>   Music -- $9.5</TE>
<TE>   USA Networks (core channels) -- $8.6</TE>
<TE>   Film/TV -- $5.0</TE>
<TE>   Theme parks and recreation -- $2.0</TE>
<TE>   Games -- $1.1</TE>

<HD>Liberate to Restate Sales as Investigation Widens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberate Technologies Inc., a leading supplier of software for TV
set-top boxes, announced late Thursday that auditors have found more
evidence of questionable accounting, forcing the company to restate
more than 10% of its revenues since mid-2001.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it had placed its chief operating officer,
Donald Fitzpatrick, on leave until the investigation was finished.
The revised financial reports are expected in December.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, issued after the markets closed, worsened what
already has been a tough year for the company. Liberate's stock has
lost almost 90% of its value since January. It lost 34 cents Thursday
to close at $1.53 in regular Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations stemmed from an investigation launched last month.</TE>
<TE>   The audit committee initially questioned the "appropriateness and
timing" of recognizing $1.84 million in software licensing revenue
from a single transaction. But the subsequent investigation turned up
more transactions with questionable accounting, totaling about $10
million in revenue from June 2001 to August 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Liberate, based in San Carlos, Calif., withdrew its previous
projections for sales and expenses on Thursday. The company also said
that sales for the current three-month period will be "materially
below" its previous $15-million to $20-million projection.</TE>

<HD>Tech Stocks Drive Rally</HD>
<DH>Key indexes have highest closes in months, fueled by upbeat
economic and company profit reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street continued to rally Thursday, driving key indexes up
sharply amid surging trading volume.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the long bear market is finally over is still unclear. But
for many big investors, missing any substantial rebound would
compound the poor performance of the last 2 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   A positive profit report from Hewlett-Packard Co., and some fresh
data suggesting the economy is picking up, helped boost the Dow Jones
industrials 222.14 points, or 2.6%, to 8,845.15, the highest close
since Aug. 26.</LD>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index leaped 48.20
points, or 3.4%, to 1,467.55 -- its best level since June 19.</TE>
<TE>   Although many investors remain worried that stocks' rebound from
five-year lows in mid-October could soon fizzle, optimists say the
market finally is shaking off the bad news of the last two years and
expecting better times in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are clearly looking for good news, and they're starting
to get some," said Doug Foreman, chief investment officer for
domestic equities at Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he said, "All the things that caused the bear market
are yesterday's stories" -- among them, accounting scandals, a
collapse of capital spending in the tech sector and severe
overvaluation of many stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The calendar also is helping, analysts said. Many institutional
money managers, who invest for insurance firms, mutual funds and the
like, are anxious to reduce their year-to-date portfolio losses. To
do that, managers will have to be fully invested if stocks continue
to climb between now and Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Big investors' eagerness to get on board showed in Thursday's
soaring trading volume. New York Stock Exchange trading rose to its
highest level since July. Winning stocks outnumbered losers by more
than 2 to 1 on the NYSE and on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "The volume tells you this is real," said Kevin Marder, strategist
at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors sold bonds to buy stocks, sending longer-term
Treasury yields to four-week highs.</TE>
<TE>   The news on the economy Thursday was upbeat. The Conference
Board's index of leading economic indicators in October halted a
four-month decline. And weekly claims for jobless benefits hit a
four-month low.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent data have been mixed, raising questions about the
economy's ability to mount a strong recovery in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Federal Reserve's cut in its key short-term interest
rate on Nov. 6, one day after voters handed the Republican Party
control of Congress, money managers increasingly see the odds as
favoring a healthier economy, said Jack Ablin, chief investment
officer at Harris Trust in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling that the Fed, and federal fiscal policy, are
going to trip over themselves to get the economy going again," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A stronger economy, in turn, would be expected to translate into
higher corporate earnings, underpinning stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Investors on Thursday poured into many stocks that are classic
"cyclical" plays -- companies that would benefit from a pickup in
consumer and business demand for goods and services. General Motors
gained $3.20 to $38.50 and International Paper rose $1.65 to $37.41.</TE>
<TE>   Also, General Electric advanced $2.05 to $26.85 despite lowering
its earnings outlook for 2002 because of costs to bolster reserves at
its reinsurance unit. The $1.4-billion expense was less than analysts
had expected. GE also cheered investors by raising its quarterly cash
dividend 1 cent a share, to 19 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Profit hopes got a lift after Hewlett-Packard late Wednesday
reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations. HP shares zoomed
$2.14, or 13%, to $18.99, the highest since May. The stock is up 70%
since Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech shares also rallied sharply Thursday. An index of
semiconductor issues rose 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said the snap-back in depressed tech stocks is being
helped by "short covering," as investors who had borrowed and sold
the shares, counting on further declines, rush to buy them back to
close out their bets.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index has surged 31.7% from its five-year low reached
on Oct. 9. The Dow has risen 21.4% in the same period and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is up 20.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Year-to-date, Nasdaq still is down 24.8%, the S&amp;P 500 is down
18.7% and the Dow is off 11.7%.</TE>

<HD>Investors Nibbling at the Mexican Food Industry</HD>
<DH>Small Southland processors are being cobbled together as
equity firms look to place funds</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burned by dot-coms and telecom, some investors are thinking
enchiladas rather than e-commerce, burritos instead of broadband.</LD>
<LD>   Or in Rick Palmer's case: salsa. The food industry veteran, with
the help of a San Francisco investment firm, in recent weeks has
quadrupled annual sales of his Senor Felix Foods to $100 million by
buying up the nation's top-selling refrigerated salsa brand and
another dip rival.</LD>
<LD>   More and more, companies such as Palmer's are rapidly being
cobbled together from Southern California's fragmented network of
small to medium-sized food processors as investors look for
investments more recession-proof than technology.</LD>
<TE>   "Growth is so hard to get in the food industry with everyone
eating out," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with
Prudential Securities in New York. "One of the few areas of the food
business that is growing is Hispanic goods. Food companies are
willing to pay for this kind of growth."</TE>
<TE>   Senor Felix, which started as a one-man kitchen operation, now has
the scale to sell its tubs of fresh salsa and guacamole to
supermarkets across the country and elbow out smaller, regional
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers don't want 20 different salsas on the shelf. They want
the No. 1 brand, No. 2 and their own private label," said Palmer, who
became president last fall at Baldwin Park-based Senor Felix. San
Francisco-based Swander Pace Capital Management owns the controlling
stake in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The rush of investment should catapult some of Southern
California's familiar brands into national distribution and
ultimately expand the offerings of Mexican food in mainstream
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   In a deal announced Thursday, Don Miguel Foods in Anaheim, maker
of frozen Lean Ole and XLNT burritos as well as frozen entrees and
appetizers for supermarkets and convenience stores, was acquired by
Shansby Group, a San Francisco-based investment firm. Terms were not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Shansby also hired former Nestle USA President Robert W. Schult to
advise its portfolio of food companies. It has one manager whose sole
duty is to help these firms get into Wal-Mart stores.</TE>
<TE>   The consolidation of food processors also is turning up the heat
on smaller competitors that lack the deep pockets to launch a broad
array of products, conduct expensive advertising campaigns and pay
upfront fees to supermarkets for display space.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real concern," said Gina Harpur, president of Juanita's
Foods in Wilmington. Already, she said, "it's hard to secure our fair
share of space in supermarkets."</TE>
<TE>   Privately held Juanita's sells tens of millions of dollars' worth
of menudo, pozole, hot sauce and mole each year and has been the
target of investors, who have been scouring supermarket sales data
and talking to independent grocers to find the hottest-selling
brands.</TE>
<TE>   But Harpur, like many other industry entrepreneurs, isn't
interested in selling, preferring to keep the business -- which her
grandfather started 56 years ago -- in the family.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like we can do things on our own," she said. "We're not
just in this for the money. Our freedom is too important to us."</TE>
<TE>   Others have welcomed the opportunity to sell while interest and
prices are high.</TE>
<TE>   "We do one thing and we do it really good. But we are a one-trick
pony," said Michael Murdock, who this month sold his family's Chilay
Foods, a City of Industry firm that makes Rojo's fresh salsa, the
nation's top- selling brand, to Senor Felix. "We had a choice of
whether to plow a bunch of capital into the company to expand to
other items" or, he said, sell now.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting Senor Felix's offer allowed Murdock to remain vice
president of marketing and gave his father a lucrative way to leave
the business. At the same time, Senor Felix also bought Murdock rival
Itella Foods from the Galletti family of Los Angeles. Terms of the
deals were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth-based Excelline Foods, which supplies hand-rolled
burritos, taquitos and quesadillas to supermarkets, club stores and
food service operations, this year sold a stake for an undisclosed
amount to a fund led by Cambridge Capital Management of Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Excelline now will have the financing to ramp up distribution,
roll out products and advertise for the first time, said Vice
President Frank Ojeda. The company's sales have grown from $1.5
million to $30 million in the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   And other deals are in the works, analysts say, as investors eye
Mexican convenience food, especially quick-to-fix frozen items.</TE>
<TE>   This should lead to a wider variety of Mexican food in
supermarkets besides taco shells and belly-stuffer burritos.</TE>
<TE>   Juanita's, for instance, has taken its first steps into the
freezer case by developing tortilla soup for Costco Wholesale Corp.
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the nation's food giants also are pushing new items. Kraft
Foods Inc. will begin selling manchego -- a Spanish cheese used in
quesadillas and empanadas -- in supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   And meat packer Cargill Inc.'s Excel meat unit unveiled its
Carnicero Moderno line of marinated beef for dishes such as milanesa
and carne asada at the Expo Comida Latina, a food industry trade show
held recently at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day there's something new coming out," said Morrie Notrica,
a 50-year supermarket veteran who operates two Notrica's Family
Markets in central Los Angeles. "The whole industry has changed so
much in the last five years, we have to change our thinking" about
what Latin food is.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in the Mexican food industry have many wondering how this
influx of capital will affect these smaller companies. Will the be
toned down for a broader audience? And will a stiff corporate culture
develop as mom-and-pop entrepreneurs are replaced by business school
graduates and investor board members?</TE>
<TE>   Senor Felix owner Swander Pace Capital brought in Palmer, who had
worked at such mainstream firms as Nestle and Seagram.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old MBA has pushed to cut overhead, develop new
markets and get better deals from suppliers of ingredients, including
tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can now go direct to the grower, let them know what we need
and negotiate a discount," Palmer said. He also has rechristened
Senor Felix as Fresh Foods Concepts Inc. and is moving the company to
a single large facility in Buena Park next year.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the help of grocery veterans, there's no guarantee that
these investments in Mexican food will prove any better than Internet
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Most new grocery products fail, food analysts say, and
miscalculations can result in costly stumbles, such as Mars Inc.'s
dulce de leche flavor M&amp;Ms, which were pulled from the market this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that won't stop investors from following this trail of
money, said Pat Turpin of USBX Advisory Services, an investment
banking firm in Los Angeles that has helped broker some of the deals
between Latino food processors and private equity firms.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to see a lot more of these deals." And, he said,
"you're going to see a lot more Mexican food products in
supermarkets."</TE>

<HD>Unions Stage Protests Against Wal-Mart Stores</HD>
<DH>The retailer denies assertions by labor organizers that the
employees are unhappy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland and Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organized labor launched an offensive Thursday against Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. -- the nation's largest retailer and an emphatically
nonunion employer -- by staging protests outside 400 stores across
the country.</LD>
<LD>   The protests, which drew support from feminists, students and
religious leaders, were an attempt by labor to stir debate about the
giant discounter and to build allies in its long-running campaign to
organize Wal-Mart employees.</LD>
<LD>   At the Wal-Mart in Panorama City, about 250 people from local
unions and religious groups rallied against the chain. The Rev. Pat
Thompson, associate pastor at Immaculate Mary Church in Pacoima, said
parishioners complain to him about the difficulties of living on
Wal-Mart wages, and about the poor treatment they receive at the
store.</LD>
<TE>   "They've got the money to expand all over," he said of the
retailer. "Why can't they give their workers a living wage, and in
this day and time, medical benefits?"</TE>
<TE>   The United Food and Commercial Workers union in particular has
poured considerable resources into attempting to block or organize
Wal-Mart, so far with limited success. Other unions, including those
representing garment workers, janitors and others, have said their
members' jobs and wages are threatened by Wal-Mart's growth. But
labor as a whole has been unable to develop an effective strategy to
counter Wal-Mart's rapid expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very tough company -- it's a very tough nut,"
said AFL-CIO organizing director Stewart Acuff, speaking from a
Wal-Mart in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The Bentonville, Ark.-based chain argued that the protests had
more to do with union organizing than Wal-Mart employment practices.
"The union is a business, and it's a declining business," said
Wal-Mart spokeswoman Mona Williams. "Despite years of trying, they
have been unable to recruit Wal-Mart associates and now, out of
frustration, they have changed their tactic and are simply trying to
hurt us and damage our reputation."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters claim Wal-Mart's emphasis on low prices comes at
the expense of employees' wages and benefits, and also drives down
labor standards in global manufacturing. In addition, the National
Organization for Women claims the corporation discriminates against
female employees, saying they comprise a majority of low-paid
salesclerks but are rarely placed in management positions. The
company denies that allegation.</TE>
<TE>   The labor offensive comes as Wal-Mart, which employs more than 1
million workers in about 3,300 U.S. stores, aggressively branches out
into the highly unionized supermarket business. Next year, the
company plans to open at least 180 "super centers," which combine
sales of discount merchandise with groceries. It's set to open at
least 40 such stores in California.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company pays
competitive wages and that doing anything less would risk its
success. She said that nearly half of Wal-Mart's employees opt to buy
company-subsidized health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll last spring and summer, Wal-Mart asked customers and
employees about their attitudes toward the company and found that the
union complaints did not register, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   However, union researchers said employee turnover as high as 50% a
year indicates that Wal-Mart workers are unhappy. The union asserts
that hourly wages average $8 and that nearly two-thirds of Wal-Mart
workers lack company-paid health insurance -- a shortfall that is
said to burden public health systems.</TE>
<TE>   To stay in business, Wal-Mart's competitors must hold down wages
and benefits, which sets a low standard for retailers across the
nation, the unions claim. "We're trying to create an awareness that
as Wal-Mart goes, so goes the country," said Greg Denier,
communications director for the United Food and Commercial Workers
union.</TE>
<TE>   The UFCW has tried unsuccessfully to organize Wal-Mart workers for
years, and continues to lead labor's efforts against the chain.</TE>
<TE>   The union blames aggressive, and possibly illegal, anti-labor
tactics by the company for its failures. Denier said the National
Labor Relations Board has filed charges against Wal-Mart in 25
states.</TE>
<TE>   The company, on the other hand, said employees simply aren't
interested in joining a union. It also disputed protesters' claims
that Wal-Mart stores hurt local economies.</TE>
<TE>   "We bring low-price, affordable goods to communities," Williams
said. "We bring sales tax revenue, property tax revenue and we add
vitality just about anywhere we go. We need to do a better job of
marshaling those folks who realize the value that Wal-Mart brings to
individuals, to our associates and to our community."</TE>

<HD>Union Presses Morgan Stanley on Analyst's Report</HD>
<DH>AFL-CIO says firm's strategist cautioned clients against
investing in unionized companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Kelleher</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report by a Morgan Stanley market strategist that warned investors
away from unionized companies has drawn the ire of the nation's
largest labor organization.</LD>
<LD>   In the letter to Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Philip Purcell,
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney complained about the report by
strategist Steve Galbraith that cautioned the firm's clients against
investing in heavily unionized firms in the near term.</LD>
<LD>   In a Nov. 11 report titled "Look for the Union Label," Galbraith
wrote: "In the face of a difficult economic outlook, investors do not
want to own businesses with high fixed costs, pension funding issues,
spiraling post-retirement health-care obligations and potential labor
strife."</LD>
<TE>   Sweeney, whose organization represents more than 13 million
workers, questioned Galbraith's motives and said he was concerned
that Morgan Stanley doesn't believe in union principles such as
employee health care and pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The report is contradictory, has -- even its authors admit -- a
weak empirical foundation and appears to have been written more to
inflame its readers than to inform them," Sweeney wrote in his letter
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "In short, this research report appears to be an improperly
motivated attack on all union members, their employers and their
benefit funds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney asked for the opportunity to discuss the report with
Purcell. AFL-CIO spokeswoman Kathy Roeder said the labor organization
is not seeking any form of retraction.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Thursday, Morgan Stanley said: "Recent responses to
a research report for North American clients mischaracterizes as
Morgan Stanley policy one of its research analyst's opinion on the
investment attractiveness of unionized companies."</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney questioned the timing of the report, noting the AFL-CIO
refiled on Nov. 8 a shareholder proposal at Morgan Stanley that would
prohibit analyst conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Thursday, there were reports that Morgan
Stanley is laying off about 2,200 employees, or nearly 4% of its work
force. The investment bank is cutting costs amid the prolonged
economic downturn, a person familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman at Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The investment banking industry has suffered for a variety of
reasons in the last year, including the lack of
merger-and-acquisition activity, declines in their investment
portfolios and the slow pace of the economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley's shares rose $2.89 to $46.40 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Prudential Securities Muzzles Analysts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mum's the word at Prudential Securities as the brokerage Thursday
began prohibiting its analysts from talking to the media, saying in
an internal memo it wants to focus solely on clients.</LD>
<LD>   Critics have accused Wall Street analysts in general of issuing
overly bullish reports to help their banking colleagues win
underwriting and advisory work from companies. But Prudential, a unit
of insurance firm Prudential Financial Inc., has described its
research as "unfettered" because it dropped investment banking nearly
two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Prudential is the first big firm known to muzzle its
analysts, even though it has been featuring them in a television
advertising campaign.</LD>
<TE>   "As a result of this new policy, our fundamental analysts will not
provide additional commentary on their published reports to live and
printed news media," head of research Steve Buell said in a memo to
employees obtained by Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Published reports still will be available for the media to quote,
Buell said, and market strategists, economists and Washington
analysts can still "provide their thematic comments and insights" to
the media.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy may be a backlash against the harsh criticism
researchers are facing, one company source said.</TE>
<TE>   But a Prudential spokesman said that was not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We started out by separating our research from the investment
bank. Now we're separating our investment commentary from it reaching
people who don't pay for it through any medium," spokesman Jim Gorman
said. "It's not an anti-media policy."</TE>

<HD>Senator Backs LaFalce for Accounting Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has written to the White House
recommending that Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) head up the nation's
new accounting oversight board, as rumors swirled Thursday over who
will fill that job, as well as that of Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to President Bush, Schumer said LaFalce "would be a
logical person to head the board and would immediately lend it the
credibility it will need." LaFalce, who is retiring from the House,
helped formulate several of the measures included in July's
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the sweeping securities and accounting law reform
passed by Congress after a rash of corporate scandals.</LD>
<LD>   The act created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Its
members were selected last month, but after less than three weeks on
the job, Chairman William H. Webster resigned Nov. 12 amid
controversy over his ties to a firm that has been sued by
shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   His departure followed the Nov. 5 resignation of SEC Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt, who had backed Webster for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Since then speculation has run high about who might replace both
Webster and Pitt. Sources close to the commission said Thursday that
Charles D. Niemeier, chief accountant in the SEC's enforcement unit
and one of four current accounting board members, still was seen as a
possible interim chairman.</TE>
<TE>   No permanent accounting board chairman was likely to be chosen
until a new SEC chairman is found, sources said.</TE>

<HD>ESPN Picks L.A. to Host the X Games in 2003, '04</HD>
<DH>The annual competition in extreme sports will be held at
Staples Center and other local venues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The X Games are coming home, all grown up.</LD>
<LD>   Cable sports network ESPN announced Thursday that the annual
competition, featuring athletes in offbeat events such as aggressive
in-line skating and skateboarding, will be held at Staples Center and
other Los Angeles venues in 2003 and 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Network President George Bodenheimer said Los Angeles got the nod
over Miami, the other finalist city, because its sheer market size
would accelerate the already growing popularity of what many regard
as the Olympics of action sports. The network also felt a sentimental
tug to bring the X Games back to its Southern California roots.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the birthplace of action sports," Bodenheimer said by
telephone from ESPN's Bristol, Conn., headquarters. "In many
respects, its rightful home is in Southern California, and it's
appropriate that the games are going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co., created the X Games as programming
for younger viewers, legions of whom have embraced the edgy thrills
and anti-establishment ethos of extreme sports over more traditional
pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   First held in 1995, the games have evolved from an athletic oddity
into a hot broadcasting property -- attracting an estimated 63
million viewers this summer, according to ESPN. What's more, the
average age of those viewers was 27, compared with 43 for
professional football games and 49 for baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream companies, hoping to tap that young demographic, have
flocked to become sponsors. And cities are now vying for an event
that, although dwarfed by the Super Bowl, draws a throng of
spectators.</TE>
<TE>   The games have been held in Newport, R.I.; San Diego; San
Francisco; and most recently Philadelphia. This year's competition
featured 21 events in seven categories: downhill BMX bike racing,
bike stunts, speed climbs up walls, moto-x, skateboarding, aggressive
in-line skating and wake boarding.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia economic development officials estimated that 220,000
spectators attended last summer's X Games and pumped more than $40
million into the local economy over five days.</TE>
<TE>   L.A., with its embrace of the X Games lifestyle, stands to make
even more, some predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to have huge participation and huge attendance
levels," said William Kassoy, a vice president for Santa Monica-based
Activision, which makes action sports video games.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the events for X Games IX, scheduled for Aug.
14-18, 2003, will take place in and around Staples Center. Some will
be held at the Los Angeles Coliseum and other yet-to-be-determined
local venues, ESPN announced.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns
Staples Center, said the X Games should generate hotel bookings
totaling 10,000 room nights -- but no rent for the downtown sports
facility. He said Los Angeles' bid included no government subsidy, so
AEG offered up Staples rent-free to ESPN as an inducement.</TE>
<TE>   The trade-off, he said, is promotional value. Attracting a crowd
that wouldn't otherwise attend Los Angeles Kings and Lakers games
"bodes well" for future AEG projects, such as a new hotel and live
theater planned for land adjacent to Staples.</TE>

<HD>Contempt Motion Filed on Madster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of record companies and music publishers has asked a federal
judge to hold the Madster online file-sharing system in contempt of
court for allegedly failing to halt piracy.</LD>
<LD>   The motion, filed late Wednesday, came a week after Madster told
U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen in Chicago that it was
"impractical" to comply with a pretrial injunction he issued last
month to stop copyright infringement.</LD>
<LD>   The labels and publishers asked Aspen to appoint someone to shut
down Madster until it complies with the order and to cut off the
estimated $45,000 per month that Troy, N.Y.-based Madster collects
from its users.</LD>
<TE>   Originally known as Aimster, Madster enables users to find and
copy digital music, movies and other files on one another's computers
free.</TE>
<TE>   Like the pioneering file-sharing service from Napster Inc.,
Madster eventually was sued for copyright infringement by the major
record labels, music publishers and movie studios.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs want Madster to filter copyrighted works out of its
file-sharing system, as a federal judge in San Francisco required
Napster to do last year. In the meantime, they want Madster to pull
the plug on the computers that they say are critical to the system's
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The motion by the labels and publishers accuses Madster of taking
no steps at all to comply with the injunction. If the motion is
granted, Madster would be compelled to show Aspen why it should not
be found in con- tempt.</TE>
<TE>   Madster creator John Deep could not be reached for comment. He
said this month that he couldn't control what users share but that he
was developing software that users could employ voluntarily to
protect copyrighted songs and movies.</TE>

<HD>Boeing May Cut Another 1,500 Jobs</HD>
<DH>The layoffs at the satellite unit in El Segundo come on top
of the cutbacks already made there this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign that the slump in the telecommunications industry has
been far more severe than anticipated, Boeing Co. said Thursday that
it may slash as many as 1,500 jobs at its satellite manufacturing
operation in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing also said it plans to vacate buildings and consolidate
workers into under-utilized facilities, further jarring El Segundo's
teetering commercial real-estate market. El Segundo is still trying
to recover from the aerospace downturn of the 1990s and has one of
the highest office vacancy rates in the region.</LD>
<LD>   The additional Boeing job cuts are on top of the nearly 1,500 jobs
that the satellite unit has already slashed from its payroll this
year. By June, Boeing Satellite Systems' total work force could
shrink by more than a third to 5,800, from 8,800 that occupied the
sprawling complex before Boeing began the major cutbacks earlier this
year.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement came a day after Boeing said it was laying off
5,000 commercial aircraft workers in Washington and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Those cuts were on top of 30,000 jobs Boeing slashed this year
because of a downturn in the commercial aircraft market after last
year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The latest move at Boeing's satellite unit completely reverses an
aggressive expansion plan that Boeing undertook shortly after
acquiring the business from Hughes Electronics Corp. two years ago
amid what was expected to be a boom in global wireless communications
and Internet broadband systems.</TE>
<TE>   "It is with great reluctance that we are taking these steps, but
the magnitude of the decline in the commercial satellite market
provides us with little flexibility," said James Albaugh, president
of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, which oversees the satellite
business.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), Boeing said it was
suffering from a significant drop in orders and the company did not
see any "near-term recovery in the commercial satellite market." The
company said there were only seven commercial satellites sold this
year worldwide, compared with 27 in 2001. Only one of the seven was
sold by Boeing. The satellites, some of which can take 18 months to
build, sell for $100 million to $250 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Harman sharply criticized the cost-cutting measures as
shortsighted and said they could hurt the business in the long run if
too many core engineers are let go and satellite-making expertise is
permanently lost. "You can't just bring these people back or hire new
people to build these enormously complex systems," Harman said.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials told its El Segundo employees about the layoffs
Thursday morning. The job cuts didn't surprise analysts, who said
that in addition to the dramatic market downturn, Boeing has been hit
hard by quality problems with its satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Boeing officials had to turn over technical documents
about one of its satellite designs to insurance underwriters, hoping
to head off a possible lawsuit by insurers who are facing $1.5
billion in claims because of defects in one of its satellite designs.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's stock closed Thursday at $32.44, up 71 cents a share, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Leading Economic Indicators Unchanged</HD>
<DH>October's index shows an improving outlook, economists say.
Weekly jobless claims slide to a four-month low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brad Foss</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A yardstick of U.S. economic activity was unchanged in October,
halting a decline that began in June and suggesting that the nation's
poor financial health may be stabilizing.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Labor Department said Thursday that weekly jobless
claims fell to their lowest level in four months.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's gradually improving employment outlook helped offset
weaker consumer attitudes last month, leaving the Conference Board's
Index of Leading Economic Indicators flat at 111.4.</LD>
<TE>   It fell a revised 0.4% in September, the New York-based group said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The index measures where the overall economy is headed in the next
three to six months. It stood at 100 in 1996, its base year.</TE>
<TE>   Because analysts had expected the index to decline 0.1% last
month, Thursday's report was considered by economists to be
relatively good news.</TE>
<TE>   "It does look like the economy's weakness is starting to ebb a
bit," said Douglas Parker, senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns
Securities in Chicago. But, he added, "there are still a lot of mixed
messages out there."</TE>
<TE>   For example, the housing market remains strong, despite a sharp
decline last month, thanks in large part to low interest rates that
also have spurred homeowners to refinance loans and free up cash to
spend.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the manufacturing sector continues to suffer from too much
capacity and auto sales, which had been a clear area of strength over
the last 18 months, appear to be cooling.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index improved
in October, including unemployment claims and building permits, the
Conference Board said.</TE>
<TE>   Negative contributors were the index of consumer expectations and
average weekly manufacturing hours.</TE>
<TE>   On the labor front, new applications for unemployment insurance
fell by a seasonally adjusted 25,000 to 376,000 for the workweek
ended Nov. 16, the government reported. That left claims at their
lowest level since the week ending July 20.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst of the layoffs seems to be behind us," said Lynn
Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management.</TE>

<HD>IBM Chairman to Head Carlyle Group</HD>
<DH>Gerstner will commit 20% of his time to the buyout firm, a
haven for ex-government officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Whitestone</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Louis V. Gerstner, who as head of IBM Corp. increased its market
value twentyfold, was named chairman of Carlyle Group Inc., an
investor in defense, technology and telecommunications whose returns
have declined in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Gerstner, 60, succeeds former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
who becomes chairman emeritus of the Washington buyout firm that is a
haven for former government officials. Carlyle said Gerstner will
commit 20% of his time to the firm, whose advisors include
ex-President George Bush; his secretary of state, James A. Baker III;
and former British Prime Minister John Major.</LD>
<LD>   "They have been tilted to political types, and you couldn't add
more weight on the business operating side than Lou Gerstner," said
Rick Rickertsen, chief operating officer of Thayer Capital, another
Washington buyout firm. Gerstner's business connections may give
Carlyle access to transactions it wouldn't otherwise get, Rickertsen
said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's too early to tell whether this will result in an increase in
technology investments, but certainly he will have input on any
investments we make in that area," said Chris Ullman, a Carlyle
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle is the sixth-largest leveraged buyout firm, with assets of
$13 billion and more than 140 real estate, buyout and venture
investments, including arms maker United Defense Industries Inc. and
soft-drink bottler Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstner, who earned $10 million a year in salary and bonuses in
2000 and 2001, will serve on the committee that reviews and approves
Carlyle's global investments. The appointment takes effect Jan. 7.
His tenure as IBM chairman is over at the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>Nintendo's First-Half Profit Drops 45%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nintendo Co. said Thursday that it had lower revenue and profit for
the six months ended Sept. 30, hurt by flagging sales of its Game Boy
Advance hand-held game console, a weak Japanese economy, and a strong
yen that devalued overseas revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell 45% to $155 million, down from $280 million in the
same period last year. Sales slumped 7.8% to $1.7 billion from $1.84
billion a year earlier. It has $3.8 billion in cash. The Kyoto,
Japan-based company, which makes Pokemon video games and the GameCube
video game console, reports results semiannually.</LD>
<LD>   Nintendo shares were down 56 cents at $11.75 in U.S.
over-the-counter trading.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say much of Nintendo's weakness can be attributed to soft
sales in Japan, where the economy remains mired in a recession.
Between April and September, unit sales in Japan of Game Boy Advance
fell 61% compared with a year earlier, while GameCube sales dropped
by one-third.</TE>
<TE>   "The decline in sales was primarily in Japan," said Michael
Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, which does not
own Nintendo shares and does not conduct business with the company.</TE>
<TE>   A rising yen also contributed to Nintendo's declining financials,
since the company received 83% of its revenue from outside Japan.
Between March 31 and Sept. 30, the yen gained 8% against the U.S.
dollar, contributing to a $237-million loss due to currency
conversions.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo, which sold 6.68 million GameCubes worldwide, is tied for
second place with Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox in the console market. Sony
Corp., with more than 40 million PlayStation 2 consoles sold, holds
the No. 1 spot. Nintendo last month cut its profit forecast 11% to
$657 million for the full year ending March 31.</TE>

<HD>Petco Reverses Loss, Posts Profit That Beats Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailer Petco Animal Supplies Inc. on Thursday posted a profit in
the third quarter, boosted by higher sales at stores open at least a
year, contrasted with a loss a year ago when it had expenses related
to its initial public offering and debt.</LD>
<LD>   Petco, the No. 2 U.S. pet supply specialty retailer after Petsmart
Inc., posted net income of $12 million, or 21 cents a share,
contrasted with a loss of $17.7 million, or 46 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, earnings per share rose 75%.</LD>
<TE>   The San Diego-based retailer had forecast earnings of 19 cents to
20 cents a share. Analysts pegged the company at 20 cents, according
to research firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Net sales rose $367.5 million in the quarter from $322.9 million a
year ago, while sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of
performance, jumped 8.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expected earnings of 35 cents to 36 cents in
the fourth quarter on a 6% to 7% rise in same-store sales.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, Petco sees earnings before one-time items of 88
cents to 89 cents, with same-store sales up 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Petco has more than 500 stores in 41 states and the District of
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock fell 98 cents to close at $24.02 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>PUC to Probe Gas Companies' Market Activity</HD>
<DH>The regulators start with Sempra in search of price
manipulation during California's energy crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>State regulators ordered an investigation Thursday into whether
market manipulation figured in natural gas price spikes that inflated
customer bills and power generation costs during the 2000-01 energy
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Without discussion, the California Public Utilities Commission
voted 4 to 0 to examine gas trading practices by Sempra Energy -- the
parent of Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric --
and other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation is the latest effort to root out the causes and
place blame for the energy crisis that brought major utilities to
their knees and thrust the state into the power-buying business.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to investigate all the potential wrongdoers," and "we are
not going to stop," said PUC President Loretta M. Lynch in an
interview. The parties included in the order "may not all be
wrongdoers. Some of the buyers, the utilities, may have evidence ...
as to how the system was gamed."</TE>
<TE>   The probe initially will concentrate on Sempra and its
subsidiaries. But it will expand to include Edison International's
Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co., their affiliated companies and several gas suppliers. The PUC
ordered them to preserve their documentation and tell the commission
what they know about gas market activity that may have affected
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Gas spokeswoman Denise King said the company
will cooperate, but said "the investigation should be focused on all
market participants to ensure a fair result."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence to conclude we caused an increase in
prices," King said. "Our actions saved [customers] hundreds of
millions of dollars" by keeping prices down.</TE>
<TE>   SoCal Gas came under fire during hearings over PUC-approved
incentives that have allowed the utility's stockholders and
ratepayers to reap a windfall when the company is able to buy gas
below the market rate.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last eight years, King said the shareholders have
received or have pending about $80 million in payments, including a
$30-million windfall in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   Edison, which is not a gas utility, alleged that the incentive
system encouraged SoCal Gas to use its market clout to manipulate
prices to its advantage. SoCal Gas has denied such manipulation,
saying price spikes resulted from factors beyond its control,
including unusually cold weather.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Cherry, PG&amp;E's chief of regulatory relations, said his
utility's primary gas source is Canada and that its relatively modest
trading at the Southern California border could not have affected
prices.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has reported that high demand for natural gas and
inadequate gas storage contributed to the price spikes, but it did
not examine the role of gas trading at the border, where gas reserves
from Texas and New Mexico enter the state.</TE>
<TE>   Edison spokesman Gil Alexander commended the PUC for launching its
probe, saying, "We believe natural gas prices were manipulated....
SCE and its customers were seriously harmed by these practices and we
expect to be recompensed.</TE>

<LD>Four of the largest Spanish-language radio broadcasters called on
Arbitron Inc. to reform its measurements, saying the ratings service
badly undercounts their audience.</LD>
<LD>   Hispanic Broadcasting Corp., Spanish Broadcasting System Inc.,
Entravision Communications Corp. and Radio Unica Communications Corp.
said Arbitron should set a timeline for when it would begin weighting
its audience samples according to listeners' language preference. The
companies called on Arbitron to expand its sample sizes, saying that
would more accurately reflect the market.</LD>
<LD>   Arbitron said it was up- dating its technology and methods to
measure audiences' language mix but had no deadline.</LD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante has filed a class-action lawsuit
alleging that publisher McGraw-Hill Cos. and several energy companies
worked together to jack up energy prices in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed late Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court on
behalf of utility customers, accused the companies of feeding false
prices and trade volumes to two energy industry newsletters, Gas
Daily and Inside FERC Gas Market Reports, published by a unit of
McGraw-Hill.</LD>
<LD>   The class-action lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. California is
demanding about $9 billion from energy companies to cover what the
state claims it was overcharged for electricity at the height its
energy crisis. McGraw-Hill said the claims were baseless.</LD>

<HD>Sharper Image Reports Narrower Loss</HD>

<AU>Delbert Ellerton</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharper Image Corp.'s third-quarter loss narrowed as the specialty
electronics retailer had fewer promotions and opened more stores,
boosting sales.</LD>
<LD>   The net loss shrank to $493,000, or 4 cents a share, from $3.82
million, or 32 cents, in the year-earlier quarter, the San
Francisco-based company said in a statement. Sales in the quarter
ended Oct. 31 rose 38% to $106.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sharper Image sold more stereos, air purifiers, massage chairs and
other gizmos at full price, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Forgan said
in an interview. Sharper Image's gross margin, or the amount of sales
left after costs from making or acquiring the goods sold, rose 4.1
percentage points to 54.4%.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not being promotional at all," Forgan said. "We are
maintaining our pricing integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Sharper Image shares fell 92 cents to $19.96 on Nasdaq. They have
more than doubled in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The company was expected to have a loss of 5 cents a share,
according to analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sharper Image opened four stores in the quarter, increased ads and
sold more private-label products.</TE>
<TE>   It also agreed to sell its gadgets at Circuit City, the No. 2
electronics retailer.</TE>

<HD>Tenet's Woes Making Deals a Harder Sell</HD>
<DH>The firm's acquisition strategy, including a Louisiana
hospital deal, faces new challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wednesday night was damage control time for hospital chain Tenet
Healthcare Corp. in the southern Louisiana bedroom community of
Slidell.</LD>
<LD>   A team of Tenet executives came there to try to salvage its
$130-million deal to buy Slidell Memorial Hospital. A packed room
full of hospital board members and citizens quizzed Tenet officials
about a federal investigation of the company's Medicare billing, an
FBI raid at a Tenet facility and the company's plummeting stock
price.</LD>
<LD>   By night's end, Slidell's hospital board voted 8 to 1 to keep the
deal alive. But because of the hospital's complex ownership, the
board also agreed with a suggestion by Louisiana's attorney general
to put the sale before voters in a referendum next year.</LD>
<TE>   "Two or three weeks ago ... it would have passed," said Salvatore
A. Caruso, a former Slidell mayor. "Now ... I'm not sure. It's going
to be tough. Not impossible, but tough."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, the nation's second-largest hospital chain, has doubled in
size since the mid-'90s, and acquisitions have been a key part of its
strategy. But analysts say the company's recent troubles will make it
tougher to pursue deals.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Santa Barbara-based Tenet was one of the stars of
health care. But that was before word surfaced about a federal audit
of Tenet's sizable Medicare billings, as well as the FBI raid in
Redding, Calif., where two doctors are being investigated for
allegedly performing unnecessary heart operations. The Securities and
Exchange Commission also has begun an informal inquiry into the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's biggest rival, Nashville-based HCA Inc., was hampered in
its efforts to buy hospitals after it became embroiled in a Medicare
scandal in 1997. Although most analysts do not think that Tenet's
problems are of HCA's magnitude, they say Tenet faces a significant
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Tenet can buy any hospital right now. That growth
strategy is dead for them for a while," said Uwe Reinhardt, a
Princeton University professor and expert on health-care economics.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson disagreed, saying the chain was
about to close a deal on a hospital in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In Slidell, a community of 26,000, Tenet's recent problems led to
some pointed questions on Wednesday about everything from the
company's ability to maintain an adequate number of nurses, to its
ability to make badly needed capital improvements at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange, Slidell hospital board member Janie McKenzie
asked Tenet officials: "How low do y'all go in terms of nursing"
staff?</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's executive vice president for operations, Reynold Jennings,
said staff levels are determined by each hospital's nursing manager,
who makes decisions based on the number of patients being treated and
how sick they are.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't enough for McKenzie. "You have to start with a
complete staff, unless you have practices that we're not aware of,"
she said. "Please give us a little more practical answer."</TE>
<TE>   "We do bottom-up managing," said Jennings, adding that Tenet "errs
on the side of quality care."</TE>
<TE>   Slidell Memorial Hospital, a 182-bed, nonprofit facility, has been
losing patients to newer medical clinics. A recent tax referendum
that would have generated enough money to help the hospital make some
renovations failed, forcing it to find a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   At another point during the meeting, Caruso, the former mayor,
asked about possible staff reductions if Tenet took over the
hospital. "I can't see a massive, or even an isolated, reduction in
force," answered Dr. Stephen L. Newman, Tenet's senior vice president
of operations for the Gulf Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Whether these answers will mollify people remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is "going to have to sell it" to the voters, Slidell
hospital Chairman Al Hamauei said Thursday. "They are going to have
to ... make promises that they are going to have to keep."</TE>
<TE>   There also are some concerns about Tenet's pending $35-million
acquisition of the USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and
Hospital in Los Angeles, a 60-bed facility with a national reputation
for being on the cutting edge of cancer research. Tenet has managed
the Norris center for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some community leaders are concerned that if Tenet buys the
Norris facility, poorer residents nearby might receive less
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to see some assurances that ... the surrounding
community will still be able to receive care there," said Lark
Galloway-Gilliam, director of Community Health Councils, a nonprofit
advocacy group that tries to boost access to quality health care for
the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's Anderson said her concerns were unwarranted and that the
Norris facility would remain open to all patients.</TE>

story from Slidell, La.</TE>

<HD>TiVo Trims Loss With Sharp Jump in Revenue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TiVo Inc. of San Jose, a pioneer in digital video recording, reported
a narrower loss for its third quarter Thursday due largely to a sharp
increase in revenue from subscribers and licensees.</LD>
<LD>   For the three months ended Oct. 31, the company reported a loss of
$11.5 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with $34.5 million, or
81 cents a share, lost in the same period last year. Revenue rose to
$25 million from $5.3 million, fueled in part by a new generation of
TiVo recorders and a change in the way the company accounts for
marketing costs.</LD>
<LD>   Although TiVo has won plaudits for its technology, many analysts
and investors have worried that its programming service will fail to
attract subscribers quickly enough to sustain the company. Company
executives said they expected the losses to continue in the next
quarter and next year, but they also predicted that they'd generate
sufficient revenue to cover day-to-day cash requirements.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Ramsey, TiVo's chief executive, told analysts that the
company was focused on two initiatives in the coming year: extending
TiVo's service into music, pictures and other forms of entertainment,
and increasing the ranks of companies making TiVo-powered recorders.
He offered few details of those plans, however.</TE>
<TE>   The results were announced after the markets closed Thursday. TiVo
closed at $6.24, up 11 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Wet Seal Reports Loss of $2.5 Million in Quarter</HD>
<DH>The clothing retailer's shares rise almost 17% after it
says sales have improved this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailer Wet Seal Inc., which sells trendy clothes to girls and young
women, reported a third-quarter loss Thursday but said sales have
improved this month, prompting investors to boost its share price by
almost 17%.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County company said it lost $2.5 million, or 8 cents a
share, contrasted with a profit of $6.8 million, or 23 cents, in the
third quarter of 2001. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were
expecting a loss of 7 cents a share on average.</LD>
<LD>   Sales for the quarter ended Nov. 2 declined to $144.5 million from
$146.9 million in the comparable period last year, a 1.6% drop. Sales
at stores open at least a year, a key indicator, fell 9.6%.</LD>
<TE>   Sales were weak across all divisions, prompting
greater-than-expected markdowns in October to clear out fall
inventory and make way for new products, said Kathy Bronstein, chief
executive of the Foothill Ranch-based company, which operates 619
stores under the Wet Seal, Contempo Casuals, Arden B. and Zutopia
brands.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal, which prides itself on stocking the latest fashions, has
struggled to spark sales since the demise of the so-called bohemian
look, which attracted young shoppers last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe a shift from a very strong fashion trend in the first
and second quarter to an unclear fashion direction in the third
quarter has made for a difficult retail environment for all our
brands," Bronstein said during a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of November, sales were weaker than last year,
but were an improvement compared with the just-concluded quarter, the
company said. That was good enough news to jolt investors. The shares
gained $1.67 to close at $11.75 in Nasdaq trading. The price of the
stock is still down 25% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a stock that can turn on a dime because their business
can turn on a dime," said Elizabeth Pierce, an analyst with Wedbush
Morgan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, due to the lack of a well-defined fashion trend to drive
sales, retail analyst Christopher Krueger with Dougherty &amp; Co.
remained cautious about the significance of the improved sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too early to tell right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said fourth-quarter earnings probably would be 31
cents to 39 cents a share. Analysts were expecting 34 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The third-quarter earnings-per-share numbers are adjusted for the
3-for-2 stock split that became effective May 9.</TE>

<LD>Capital gains taxes -- A story in some editions of the California
section Nov. 3 about residents who accuse a developer of abandoning
their Yorba Linda housing tract included an inaccurate account of tax
law. A lawyer representing the home buyers said at least two families
had to pay capital gains taxes on the sale of their previous homes
because they were unable to complete the purchases of the new homes
in time. Since a 1997 change in tax law, however, homeowners are no
longer required to reinvest sale proceeds in a new home to avoid the
taxes.</LD>

<LD>Abba Eban -- An obituary Monday of Israeli diplomat and author Abba
Eban mistakenly said he was born Aubrey Solomon Eban. In fact, his
birth name was Aubrey Solomon Meir, but he grew up using the surname
of his mother's second husband.</LD>

<HD>Terror Hardens the Israeli Right</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Yossi Klein Halevi</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The result of Thursday's terrorist atrocity will be felt when
Israelis go to the polls on Jan. 28. Just as previous waves of
Palestinian terrorism undermined Israeli trust in the Oslo peace
process and helped elect right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu
in 1996 and Ariel Sharon in 2001, so will the current violence
further empower the right.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, in periods of relative quiet, the Israeli public has
allowed its moderate instincts to prevail. In the 1999 elections,
after three years of near-total cessation of terrorist attacks, in
large part because of Netanyahu's hard-line policy, Israelis elected
Labor leader Ehud Barak. Most Israelis had come to realize that the
occupation was untenable and were prepared to make previously
unthinkable compromises for peace.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, when Barak became the first leader in history to
offer shared sovereignty over his nation's capital city, the normally
voluble Israeli public was largely subdued.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Yasser Arafat's war. That war wasn't declared against a
government of hard-liners but against the most peace-minded
government in Israel's history. The domestic consequences were
overwhelming. The Israeli peace camp, which had become mainstream in
the 1990s, was reduced to a peripheral group of ideologues who
refused to concede that empowering Arafat had been a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the centrist majority shifted right. In 1999, just
before the terror war began, barely 30% of Israelis defined
themselves as right-wing; today that number exceeds 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, though, that hard-line majority isn't ideologically
right-wing. Israelis have become hawks on security, not territory.</TE>
<TE>   In principle, most Israelis still support territorial concessions.
In practice, almost no one here believes anymore that the Arab world
would offer real peace in exchange for land.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from a dogmatic minority, the Israeli public realized during
the first intifada, in the late 1980s, that the occupation is both
morally and politically untenable and that the Middle East conflict
is a struggle between two legitimate national movements. It is
precisely the failure of the Palestinian leadership to reach a
reciprocal realization that has led to Israel's current despair.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's achievement has been to embody the new center-right
sensibility. Though long identified with the West Bank settlement
movement, Sharon rarely invokes settlements anymore. Instead, he has
taken on his own party's hard-liners, led by Netanyahu, who oppose a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon now concedes that a Palestinian state is inevitable. Like
the tough but pragmatic majority he now represents, he insists that
the precondition for Palestinian independence is defeat of the
terrorist infrastructure that now occupies Palestinian society.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, there's almost nothing that the Labor Party, which
disastrously bet on Arafat as its peace partner, can do to convince
centrist voters that it deserves their trust. The left is in the
untenable position of having promoted the premise that Israeli
concessions would produce peace, then convinced the public to test
that premise, only to have the experiment literally explode in our
faces.</TE>
<TE>   The election of super-dove Amram Mitzna as Labor leader in this
week's party primaries only confirms Labor's decline as a serious
electoral contender. Imagine the U.S. Democratic Party in 1972, after
the overwhelming defeat of its liberal presidential candidate, George
McGovern, concluding that McGovern lost because he wasn't nearly
liberal enough and that it must choose as his successor, say, peace
activist Eugene McCarthy. In electing Mitzna -- who is virtually the
only Israeli politician these days who believes that Arafat remains a
legitimate negotiating partner -- that's precisely what Labor has
done.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna is in the unenviable position of having been endorsed by
Arafat, who expressed delight in his nomination. Even worse, Mitzna's
urging of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza without a
negotiated settlement was cited by a Hamas spokesman as proof that
terrorism is forcing Israelis to panic.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of Israelis understand that withdrawal under terrorist
fire would only encourage terrorism. Arafat's decision to launch his
terrorist war was a result of the success of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah in driving Israel out of Lebanon in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism cannot be appeased, only confronted. That realization
has now emerged as the defining issue of this election.</TE>

<HD>Pelosi Will Get Run Over in the Middle of the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Was it "Meet the Press" or the Sci-Fi Channel? Watching Nancy Pelosi
make her first Sunday morning TV appearance since being elected House
minority leader, I had to check the cable box twice to make sure.</LD>
<LD>   The woman answering Tim Russert's questions might have looked like
Pelosi, but she sounded like a character from "Invasion of the Body
Snatchers." What had happened to the congresswoman from California?</LD>
<LD>   Gone was the bold, combative, impassioned, progressive politician
we've come to know over her 15 years in the House. In her place was a
soulless pod person -- an empty shell mouthing the kind of pallid,
inoffensive, focus-group-tested and cringe- inducing platitudes that
have driven two-thirds of the American electorate away from politics
and a little more than half of the remaining one-third away from the
Democratic Party.</LD>
<TE>   The only member of the Democratic leadership to vote against the
president's use-of-force resolution, she had been unequivocal in her
opposition to war with Iraq. "I have not seen intelligence to justify
the action that the president is suggesting," she said in September
after a White House meeting with President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   But there she was, 72 hours after her historic ascendance to her
new post, vowing to back the president -- even if he unilaterally
attacks Iraq without U.N. approval. "If our young people are called
to duty," she said, "certainly we'll support the action of the
president."</TE>
<TE>   I had to turn up the volume on my TV set to make sure I was
hearing her right. Sure enough, Pod Pelosi was coming out foursquare
in favor of backing our fighting men and women, having conveniently
skipped right over the question of whether they should be put on the
front lines in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   And when Russert asked her to reconcile this with her previous
opposition, she dismissed him with a curt: "That's neither here nor
there now. Let's put that aside."</TE>
<TE>   And so they did.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the specter of Pelosi's former self appeared and
suggested, "I do think that we can raise some questions before
sending [our troops] into harm's way," she didn't raise a single one.
Who then, if not one of the heads of the, nominally, opposition party
is going to raise these questions? Paul Wolfowitz, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   She was similarly compliant when it came to the president's
handling of the war on terrorism. Pelosi gave the president two
thumbs up, contending that when it comes to combating terror,
Americans "are in better shape now than we were last year." Pelosi
even tried to put a positive spin on the fact that Osama bin Laden is
still on the loose, making the startling claim that the Al Qaeda
mastermind isn't really "such an essential piece" of the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   So we have reason enough to bomb Iraq into the Stone Age, but Bin
Laden isn't worth losing sleep over?</TE>
<TE>   Turning her gaze on the smoldering ruins of election night 2002,
Pelosi offered up some Churchillian language. "Never again," she
promised, "will you see a situation where the Democratic Party will
go forth into an election with the Republicans characterizing who we
are, but without a Democratic message to inoculate against that
mischaracterization." Yet when she tried her hand at delivering that
message, the best she could manage were shopworn banalities about
plans to "grow the economy" and "create jobs."</TE>
<TE>   I'm afraid that inoculation is in need of a booster shot.</TE>
<TE>   To hear Pod Pelosi tell it, her leadership role is all about
finding the political middle. "We must seek our common ground with
the administration," she told Russert. And I lost count of the number
of times she used the word "consensus."</TE>
<TE>   The last thing the Democrats need right now is another champion of
compromise -- another Dick Gephardt. Why does she think he stepped
down in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   "She has got her beliefs," Pelosi's communications director,
Brendan Daly, helpfully explained. "But we are here to win, and she
understands that to do that you need to be in the middle."</TE>
<TE>   Well, congratulations. Because based on Pelosi's inaugural
appearances as minority leader-elect, yet another soulless
middle-of-the-roader is precisely what the Democrats and the country
are about to get.</TE>

<HD>Give the Palestinians a Stake in Peace</HD>
<DH>Letting them have shares of Israel's economy could help
both sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gideon Parchomovsky and Peter Siegelman</AU>
<BD>Gideon Parchomovsky is a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Law. Peter Siegelman is a professor at Fordham
Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although peace between Israel and the Palestinians would produce
immense benefits for both sides, the situation is hopelessly
deadlocked. Meanwhile, terrorism has not only forced Israel to
increase its expenditures on security, it has devastated the Israeli
economy. The Palestinian economy is in even shakier condition.</LD>
<LD>   What's needed is an alignment of interests of the Palestinians and
Israelis. One way to do this is to give the Palestinians a direct
stake in the Israeli economy. President Bush announced in early July
that he was looking for new ways of giving money to Palestinians that
would prevent the funds from being used to sponsor terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how it might be done: First, create an index fund that
would buy a value-weighted composite of the entire Israeli stock
market, much the way Vanguard or Fidelity index funds track the U.S.
stock market's overall performance. (That is, if a company had 2% of
the assets in the market, it would get 2% of the fund's investment.)</LD>
<TE>   Next, establish a pool of roughly $9 billion -- about 10% of the
total capitalized value of the Israeli stock market -- to be invested
in the index fund. To raise the money, the U.S., Israel and European
states could redirect some of their current assistance to the
Palestinian Authority, with the remainder coming from Arab countries,
as necessary. Each of the roughly 3 million Palestinian residents of
the West Bank and Gaza would then be given a share of the fund, worth
on the order of $3,000 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder registration should initially be anonymous to prevent
intimidation of participants by extremist groups. Share prices might
be published daily, but the shares would be held in escrow until the
two sides agreed to the distribution of the fund in a peace treaty.
At that point, the shares would become the property of their owners,
with the caveat that they could not sell more than 25% over the
course of five years (to prevent panic selling or deliberate
sabotage).</TE>
<TE>   If no peace treaty was achieved within 10 years, the fund would be
liquidated, with the proceeds donated to Israeli victims of terror
and to humanitarian relief in the territories.</TE>
<TE>   We recognize that the root of the conflict is not narrowly
economic and that some extremists would reject any material
incentives. Yet there may be many other Palestinians who would
respond.</TE>
<TE>   This proposal has numerous advantages for all parties. First, as
real stakeholders in Israel, Palestinians would have an immediate
material interest in peace because this would naturally raise the
value of their holdings. They would have a daily, personal and easily
measured reminder of the effects of continued violence: Each suicide
bomber, each threat to Israel's long-term security would drop the
price of their shares. Might this not have some effect on their
willingness to support such behavior, at least at the margins?</TE>
<TE>   A side benefit of this scheme is the important symbolic
implications: An investment -- even in one's current enemy -- can
improve one's own well-being.</TE>
<TE>   A second advantage is that the plan adds a constructive new
dimension to peace negotiations. Even though many Israelis are
willing to make serious concessions for peace, the country cannot
afford to surrender territory or give up on bargaining positions as
long as doing so is likely to be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
But giving your opponent something of value that he hasn't actually
asked for is a way for Israel to show goodwill toward Palestinians
without appearing to negotiate out of weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Third, giving Palestinians a stake in Israeli companies would
alleviate some of the political pressure from Europe and Arab
countries to impose economic sanctions on Israel. Indeed, financing
the plan might even increase the base of foreign customers of Israeli
products.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also could have salutary political consequences within
the Palestinian community. The shares could be given directly to
individuals, circumventing the corrupt and inefficient Palestinian
Authority and strengthening the constituency for democracy and peace.
Moreover, given the nexus between economic prosperity and stable
democratic rule, improving the economic well-being of the
Palestinians would make them less dependent on their leaders and
thereby foster pro-democratic ideology as well as a commitment to a
market economy.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the plan would be likely to reduce anti-American
sentiments. By finding a way to help ordinary Arabs without
supporting the anti-democratic regimes under which they live, the
U.S. would improve its image and increase its influence in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Would our proposal turn Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade into free-market, pro-peace liberal organizations?
We're not that naive. But our plan could only help those forces among
the Palestinians that recognize the enormous benefits that could flow
from peace.</TE>
<TE>   In today's climate, any such step should be welcome.</TE>

<HD>Rap Battles of '8 Mile': Flying Words Are Better Than
Flying Bullets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jody Rosen</AU>
<BD>Jody Rosen is a music critic and author of "White
Christmas: The Story of an American Song" (Scribner, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rap is the most word-intoxicated genre in the history of American
popular music. Against a stark background of pure rhythm, rappers'
words arrive in a torrent of syncopated speech -- rhymes, puns,
jokes, allusions -- spilling over the edges of the meter that
constrains the lyrics of normal "sung" songs.</LD>
<LD>   The ebullient verbosity and wit of rap make even the most
illustrious earlier examples of pop lyric writing -- from the
show-tune drolleries of Lorenz Hart and Cole Porter to the poetic
flights of Bob Dylan -- seem linguistically austere.</LD>
<LD>   In the nearly quarter of a century since it first penetrated the
mainstream, rap has been relentlessly maligned, accused of everything
from trashing musical standards to promoting violence and misogyny.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the debate that the music provokes, a central fact is
generally overlooked: First and foremost, rap is a celebration of
language. That celebration is at the heart of "8 Mile," the Eminem
movie whose box-office gross is the talk of show business. The film's
success has been called a watershed event, signaling rap's pop
preeminence and Eminem's ascension to Elvis-like multimedia
superstardom.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem is, of course, not just a pop star but a provocateur with a
talent for equal-opportunity outrage. His gross-out lyrics and
renegade posturing have made him the bugbear of everyone from the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to Lynne Cheney, the
conservative commentator and wife of the vice president. Predictably,
the success of "8 Mile" has been decried in certain quarters as
evidence of societal decline: American youth following Eminem down
the road to Gomorrah.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "8 Mile" offers a lesson for everyone, from rap's shrillest
public critics to parents concerned about their children's immersion
in an inscrutable music. The film is fairly banal stuff: a
victory-of-the-underdog fable that shares with "Rocky" a Great White
Hope protagonist and a plot that plods inexorably toward a decisive
showdown.</TE>
<TE>   "8 Mile" sags when it portrays the troubled family life and
romantic travails of Eminem's character, Rabbit, but is electric when
rappers lock wits in "battles," trading rapid-fire rhymed boasts and
taunts. At this sober post-Sept. 11 moment, shouldn't we be cheered
by the arrival of a box-office blockbuster whose climactic
confrontation is not an orgy of death, fireballs and raining glass
but a bloodless exchange of rhymed couplets?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, rap battles get at the essence of the music's appeal. It
serves both the body and the brain: While its rhythms ignite the
dance floor, its lyrics engage the intellect with a force unique in a
world of "moon-June" pop songwriting. Those who complain that rap is
repetitive have closed their ears to the mercurial stream of words
that flows around its unswerving beat, words that concern not just
sex, money and guns but love, politics, the minutiae of everyday
life, the whole mad pageant of American social experience.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's popularity rests above all on his mastery of this art.
Certainly rap is an African American creation, and it is hard not to
suspect that rappers have been victims of a subtle racism that
undervalues their achievements as lyricists. Americans have a nasty
habit of trampling on homegrown flowers -- it was only recently that
jazz graduated from a vaguely despised "low art" to a hallowed place
in the cultural pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   At a time of international crisis, however, rap's popularity is
remarkably universal: Eminem is a hero to Middle Eastern youth, and
the U.S. government is broadcasting hip-hop on the airwaves of Radio
Sawa in its campaign for that crucial frontier, the Arab street.</TE>
<TE>   We should be thankful for our rapping ambassadors, beguiling the
world with two proud American exports: rhythm and wit.</TE>

<LD>The hottest ticket in town may be for today's showdown between the
embattled head of Los Angeles' film permitting agency and the
agency's executive board.</LD>
<LD>   Entertainment Industry Development Corp. President Cody Cluff has
rebuffed calls by some board members to step aside during an ongoing
criminal probe into possible misuse of funds. Today the executive
committee is expected to give him the hook anyway and place him on
paid administrative leave.</LD>
<LD>   It's time. Putting Cluff on paid leave is not, as his lawyer
claims, the same as jumping to the conclusion that he has done
something illegal. It's simply good business.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors
created the agency to keep film production, jobs and tax revenues
from fleeing Los Angeles. Wooing film companies and making life
easier for them by offering a one-stop permitting shop was and is a
good idea.</TE>
<TE>   City and county officials have every right to expect the agency's
director to give the work his full attention. Cluff, however,
complains of being caught up in a "political and journalistic frenzy"
as the Los Angeles County district attorney's office serves search
warrants from here to Pennsylvania, where investigators allege that
he gave nearly $47,000 in agency funds to a Pittsburgh film office
headed by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's refusal to recognize the need to step aside for the good
of the agency is not the only poor judgment he's shown. Questions of
legality aside, a county audit of the film agency turned up such
over-the-top spending as 100% tips at restaurants and $3,000
memberships to cigar clubs. It also revealed contributions to some of
the elected officials who sit on the agency's 45-member board; some
members said they didn't even realize they were on the board until
news of the investigation -- and political contributions -- broke.</TE>
<TE>   The blame for that, of course, lies with the City Council members
and county supervisors, who, after creating the agency in 1995 and
putting themselves on its board, seem to have pretty much forgotten
about it.</TE>
<TE>   They know about it now, big-time, and have ordered up a better
management structure than the current unwieldy one that combines
politicians and industry representatives. They also need to clarify
whether the agency they created is private or public; astonishingly,
no one seems sure.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the board's executive committee will take a
stride toward new accountability by removing Cluff, at least
temporarily. Yes, the show must go on. But for now, it could do with
a little less drama.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea's Foolish Gamble</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>North Korea continues to dangerously shroud its nuclear intentions,
in a losing bet that the rest of the world will let it do so. At one
point this week it seemed to claim that it already had nuclear
weapons. Then it backtracked, saying only that it is "entitled" to
build them. On Thursday, it said its 1994 agreement to halt atomic
weapons production had collapsed because the United States suspended
fuel oil deliveries. However, the suspension came last week, well
after Pyongyang first indicated the pact was dead.</LD>
<LD>   It has always been difficult to decipher the intentions of this
paranoid, secretive nation, ruled by father-and-son dictators for
more than half a century. The bluster and brinkmanship of its foreign
policy, from invading South Korea in 1950 to its kidnapping of
Japanese citizens in following decades, have increased its isolation.</LD>
<LD>   For the last month, the United States and its allies have tried to
agree on the best response to North Korea's admission that it
maintained a nuclear weapons program despite agreeing eight years ago
to give it up in exchange for the U.S. promise of fuel oil shipments
and the construction of two nuclear power reactors less likely to be
used for weapons-uranium production.</LD>
<TE>   So far, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have struck the right notes in
a good-cop, bad-cop stance. North Korea is demanding a formal
nonaggression pact, but such treaties are not handed out as rewards
for breaking nuclear weapons pacts. Europe, Japan and South Korea
have economic leverage and should hold back on extending economic
credits and increasing trade with Pyongyang. Unfortunately, it is
ordinary North Koreans who may suffer more hunger and cold because of
their leaders' high-stakes gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Washington allowed delivery of a final shipment of 47,000 tons of
heavy fuel oil this month. "Suspending" new deliveries, rather than
ending them, gives Pyongyang the chance to reverse course and regain
the oil that provides about 30% of its energy.</TE>
<TE>   By the government's own admission, nearly half of North Korea's
children under 5 are chronically malnourished, a condition that
jeopardizes mental and physical development. Contributions from the
U.S. and other countries to the United Nations' World Food Program
are all that prevent widespread famine in the nation of 23 million.
Still, North Korea continues to menace South Korea and the 37,000
U.S. troops stationed there, making the demilitarized zone between
the two countries one of the most heavily fortified borders on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   China, Pyongyang's closest ally, should use more of its leverage
to persuade North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. Spending
money on weapons instead of food and moving at a snail's pace to
overhaul a disastrously mismanaged economy threaten the nation more
than the phantom risk of invasion.</TE>

<LD>What's behind the huge jumps in the cost of U.S. medical care,
increases occurring even as the economy stagnates? Tenet Healthcare
Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey C. Barbakow might have part of
the answer. He presided over aggressive price increases that allowed
the hospital company to glean a windfall from the Medicare system.
After getting caught, he acknowledged a problem -- sort of: "While
this approach is legal, it is not the way I want to run this company,
and it reflects poorly on our hospitals in the communities we serve."</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators will decide whether Tenet, the nation's
second-largest hospital operator, broke any laws with its pricing
"strategy." But pricing is just one of Tenet's lapses. Barbakow, who
earned $4.2 million in salary and bonuses last year and soon will
qualify for $1.89 million in annual retirement pay, recently cashed
in stock options valued at $111 million. A second top executive in
October cashed in options worth about $10 million.</LD>
<LD>   To modify Barbakow's own words: "While this compensation approach
is legal, it's not the way Tenet's board of directors should run this
company, and it reflects poorly on hospitals in the communities Tenet
serves."</LD>
<TE>   Tenet's high reliance on Medicare payments, plus a separate
investigation into whether doctors at a Tenet hospital in Redding,
Calif., performed costly but unnecessary coronary procedures, has
raised red flags among patients and taxpayers, not to mention
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow did revive a company that a decade ago was awash in
scandal and a heartbeat away from Bankruptcy Court. And for-profit
companies clearly must produce a financial return for shareholders.
What's missing is a sense of balance.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet says it encourages a corporate culture in which physicians
and employees strive for higher standards, a noble goal in a
profession that exists to ease pain and improve the human condition.
However, pressure to increase profits at patients' expense is all too
common on Wall Street, which is drooling at the prospect of aging
boomers' need for medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care companies' quarterly profits and compensation packages
are funded by the very patients who are being priced out of the
medical coverage needed to get radiation therapy, coronary care and
other treatments. The system is broken if what makes health-care
executives and investors happy comes at the expense of patients who
can't afford to get sick and employers who can't afford to offer
decent health insurance.</TE>

<HD>Humans Trash Condor Recovery Program</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Biologists Hatch New Plan for Condors" (Nov. 11) implies that the
breeding condors are not quality birds -- and that this is the reason
they are feeding their chicks trash and ultimately failing to raise
their chicks successfully. The following may enlighten you about how
other wildlife are faring with the amount of trash humans discard
thoughtlessly.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous species of whales have been found dead with plastic bags
and balloons in their stomachs; sea turtles all over the world suffer
a similar fate. Albatross chicks on isolated Pacific islands are
discovered dead in their nests with their insides full of plastics.
Of the world's 312 species of seabirds, 111 have been known to ingest
trash; plastics are found in up to 80% of birds in some Alaskan
seabird species.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, a number of wild condor nests were known to be
littered with trash. We know that condors mistakenly eat trash, but
it remains to be seen whether this will ultimately be a major problem
for the California Condor Recovery Program. It is definitely not an
issue of quality birds.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is a human one, not a condor one. In the past, almost
everything that wildlife may have mistaken for being edible was
readily biodegradable. Now it can be lethal. An article that educates
the public on how pollution and environmental toxins, such as plastic
and lead, can harm wildlife would be more beneficial.</TE>

<LD>Re "What Does It Profit a Man to Gain an MBA?" Commentary, Nov. 18:
Thomas Lindsay's argument seems to be that if we teach our MBAs more
ethics in business school they will behave themselves. Would he apply
that same logic to a wave of rapes, child molestations or
carjackings? In those cases, most people would want swift justice for
the current offenders and stiffer laws to deter future criminals.
Only after both of those were in place would they try to fix the
moral fiber of potential offenders.</LD>
<LD>   At boot camp, my drill instructor said if our stuff was stolen
because we left it unprotected, we'd made an honest man a thief.
Deregulation has done the same thing in the business world.</LD>
<LD>   To someone whose whole focus in life is making money, picking
someone else's pocket is too irresistible if it's legal -- or if
through a few well-placed political contributions can be made legal.
As long as the Bushies are in the White House, though, the only
solution to corporate carjacking will be more driver's education.</LD>
<TE>   Michael J. Dixon</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay asks why some at Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing
weren't able to muster the moral courage to say "Stop" to the
executives engaged in unethical behavior. The answer is very simple:
It is the culture of greed and hubris perpetuated by the MBA schools
over the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of teaching the technical fundamentals of business
operations and the virtues of social responsibility, these
institutions have been peddling the false notion of creating
corporate leaders. The reality is that leadership is an innate human
quality that cannot be taught. Similarly, morals and ethical behavior
are rooted in our value system, which an MBA curriculum would not be
able to influence.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hope: Last Refuge of the Helpless," Commentary, Nov. 17: At one
moment in history we were enthralled by the catch phrase "peace
dividend." Now John Balzar reminds us that centrist politics have
turned that dream into baby steps in a wandering circle. While the
public, voting or not voting, watched in a stupor, a determined
movement has taken control. It bought a Congress that will install a
plan. George W. Bush, leading a van of corporate looters, took office
and they immediately debauched themselves and laid out for all to see
where deregulation leads us.</LD>
<LD>   They reduced taxes on the rich, laid out a plan to raid Social
Security and now are taking secure Civil Service jobs with pensions
and privatizing them with people with 401(k)s that can be looted.
Each voter and nonvoter, to them, is just a microeconomic digit. Add
them together and a large pool of money appears. If you can just
break the lockbox -- or any other impediment to creative management
-- fortunes can be made. The grand sweep of it all is breathtaking.
We need a new catch phrase. How about "macroeconomic looting"? It
doesn't roll off the tongue like "peace dividend."</LD>

<LD>Once again The Times fails to draw distinctions about who's
responsible for the continued violence in Israel. "Sharon's West Bank
Folly" (editorial, Nov. 20) stated that "permanent peace between
Israel and the Palestinians ... was interrupted nearly two years ago
by a failure to agree on how to exchange land for peace."</LD>
<LD>   I suppose that, technically, Israel offering 98% of the West Bank,
plus the difference made up from land in Israel proper -- an offer
turned down by Yasser Arafat -- is "a failure to agree." But pointing
out the truth would only dilute the strength of The Times' editorial
purpose of condemning Israel.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorials are usually good intentioned but they miss the
Jewish perspective. Hebron is the place where our biblical patriarchs
and matriarchs are buried: Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and
Leah among others. Your editorial seems to blame the Jewish presence
in Hebron as an obstacle to peace. The only obstacles to peace are
the terrorist organizations that rule Palestinian lives.</TE>
<TE>   Jews will never give up their access to Hebron and the Jewish
sites. Jewish history in Israel goes back 3,800 years. When
Palestinians decide to get rid of Arafat and his reign of terror and
accept Jews in the area, they will find peace.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial selectively addresses Islamic Jihad's refusal to
acknowledge Israel's right to exist. True, but the root cause of the
ongoing violence is the refusal of the entire Palestinian population
to accept Israel's right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Oslo accords, the Hebron agreements and the Camp David
peace proposals, the surrounding Arab governments, the Palestinian
Authority, the Palestinian media and Muslim clergy still publicly
vilify Jews, Americans and the West as their enemies. The
dysfunctional countries of the Muslim Middle East are filled with
virulent racism, hatred and rage. Until they are willing to accept
other religions and cultures different from their own, we will have
war in the Philippines, India, Russia, Malaysia, Israel and anywhere
else Muslims are urged by their leadership to direct their rage at
non-Muslims.</TE>

<HD>The Cost of Bringing Pandas to L.A. Would Be Unbearable</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hahn Hopes to Bag a Pair of Pandas on Far East Trip," Nov. 19:
Should the Chinese government, heaven forbid, agree to have giant
pandas at the Los Angeles Zoo, I hope the exhibit never comes to
fruition. I am a frequent visitor to the Los Angeles Zoo and am often
embarrassed by and ashamed of the behavior of some of the people
around me.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors to this zoo holler and throw foreign objects at the
animals and tease them. I have viewed the three pandas in the San
Diego Zoo several times and know that visitors to this exhibit must
be quiet and conduct themselves as observers when walking through to
see them.</LD>
<LD>   I truly do not think that everyone going to the L.A. Zoo is
capable of doing this, especially around animals that require a
serene environment. Mayor James Hahn may be trying to arrange for a
money-making attraction at his zoo, but he will be doing it at the
cost of the pandas' mental and emotional well-being. There are not
enough pandas in the world anymore, so we cannot afford to have even
two suffer at the L.A. Zoo.</LD>
<TE>   Connie Hall</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that Hahn is like a kid in a toy store: Mommy, I
want the panda! When hospitals and emergency rooms are being closed
and children commute halfway across the city [to school] because of
lack of money, how can the mayor think he (or rather the city of
L.A.) has the money for a panda? Not to mention the time and money he
and his staff will have to spend schmoozing the Chinese government --
with no guarantees of success!</TE>
<TE>   I'm mad at the mayor's naivete and (proposed) callous spending of
taxpayers' money. Let's hope he doesn't see anything else that he
wants to spend tax money on.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Coventry</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the mayor wants to bring a couple of animals to Los Angeles
from China with millions of taxpayers' dollars. Seems to me that we
already have too many animals in L.A. -- the kind that go around
shooting people. Wouldn't all that money be put to better use in
stopping all the violence in L.A.?</TE>

<LD>Carolina Panther punter Todd Sauerbrun apparently won't be attending
a Gramatica family reunion any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   Sauerbrun was already angry at Tampa Bay's Martin Gramatica for
the way the Buccaneer kicker celebrated after his four field goals
gave the Buccaneers a 12-9 victory over the Panthers last month.</LD>
<LD>   Then Sunday, after Tampa Bay won the rematch, 23-10, Sauerbrun
said Gramatica's youngest brother taunted him outside the locker room
after the loss.</LD>
<TE>   "That kid is as big of an idiot as his brother," Sauerbrun said,
"and I'm sure his other brother is too. It goes right down the line."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gramatica, the middle brother, kicks for the Arizona
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Gramatica had to be restrained from going after Sauerbrun
after Sunday's game.</TE>

Gramatica said. "I don't respect people like that."</TE>

new meaning to the concept of a sabbatical. The 22-year-old has
become the first female elephant driver, taking a break from her day
job in Japan to learn the art of riding the huge creatures in
Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "I had always liked elephants but became attracted by their
charm," she told the news agency Kyodo. "They are sensitive and
clever. They read a person's thoughts. No matter how well you ride
them, they will not adapt themselves to you unless you really love
them."</TE>
<TE>   There are some limits, though. Endo sticks to riding female
elephants because the males have bad tempers.</TE>

<TE>   Big business: The more goalposts ripped down, the better for Neil
Gilman, president of Gilman Gear. After all, if the posts fall, they
have to go back up.</TE>

<TE>   Stupid penalty tricks: There's nothing like a long trip to make a
hockey player cranky. But Teemu Selanne's discontent had more to do
with the San Jose Sharks' penchant for landing in the penalty box.</TE>

<LD>If the playoffs began today, the Mighty Ducks would be one of the
Western Conference's top eight teams. A nice thought, but the Ducks
still have 62 regular-season games to play, starting tonight when
they play host to Dallas at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   First-year Coach Mike Babcock is pleased with Anaheim's 8-6-3-3
start, but he knows that playoff berths are not earned before
Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   "There isn't one guy [on the team] who wouldn't have been pumped
if you told him at the beginning of the season that we'd be where we
are right now," Babcock said.</LD>
<TE>   "After 20 games last season, Calgary and Edmonton both had 30
points and Detroit had 35. They were the top three teams [in the
conference]. But at the end, neither Calgary or Edmonton were in the
playoffs. There's a message in that."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have recorded a point in each of their last eight
games, are 6-1-0-3 after a 2-5-3-0 start. The recent success even
attracted television cameras for Thursday's practice at Disney Ice,
which has not happened often in the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I come to the rink knowing that we're going to work hard,"
Babcock said. "That wasn't the case early in the season. Then, I was
just hoping.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to have expectations here.... I'd like to get to the
point when you don't have to ask if the cameraman has directions [to
the Ducks' practice facility]."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will be tested by the Stars, who have the best record in
the NHL at 12-4-4-1. It will be the first game of a five-game home
stand for Anaheim, which will play nine of its next 12 games at the
Pond.</TE>

getting good offensive production from Sergei Zubov, who has three
power-play goals and 19 points. Center Steve Rucchin leads the Ducks
with 15 assists.</TE>

<HD>Plan Is Nixed by Racing Board</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Park officials unhappy after proposal to cut off
betting earlier is rejected in 5-1 vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood Park officials reacted angrily Thursday after the
California Horse Racing Board turned down the track's request to
discontinue betting a minute or more before the start of each race.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of my comments would be under the heading of 'expletives
deleted,' " said Rick Baedeker, president of Hollywood Park. "I'm
surprised and disgusted. The racing board has chosen convenience over
integrity."</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of the pick-six scandal at last month's Breeders'
Cup, and in response to bettors' concerns that bets on Hollywood Park
races were being made after the races started, Churchill Downs Inc.
announced Nov. 8 that its tracks, which include Hollywood, would halt
betting as the horse-loading process began at the gate. Churchill
Downs and other tracks in its family, including Calder Race Course in
Florida and Hoosier Park in Indiana, have begun the new system, but
Hollywood Park needed racing board approval.</LD>
<TE>   The board rejected Hollywood Park's proposal by a 5-1 vote.
Commissioner Marie Moretti supported the measure and a seventh board
member, William Bianco, was absent.</TE>
<TE>   "[The change] is not worth the inconvenience to the relatively few
horseplayers that we've been able to keep coming to the track," said
Alan Landsburg, the racing board chairman. "This would be a penalty
for the players who like to wait as long as they can to make their
bets."</TE>
<TE>   Had the board approved Hollywood Park's request, the change would
not have affected other tracks, several of which support the status
quo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a kick in the face," Tom Meeker, chairman of Churchill
Downs Inc., said by phone. "What also bothers me is that the board
didn't articulate, in my judgment, a good reason to turn us down. The
sport has been hit over the head by a 2-by-4, and this is the time
for rock-solid leadership. This was one of the things I thought we
could fix, but maybe the racing board doesn't believe that Hollywood
Park is a good licensee."</TE>
<TE>   John Van de Kamp, president of the Thoroughbred Owners of
California, said his group felt that the Hollywood proposal needed
more study.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wait six months to do something," Baedeker said. "The
public isn't stupid. When they see the odds change when the horses
are turning for home, they have a problem, and the industry has a
horrible perception problem because of this."</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker and Brooks Pierce, president of Autotote Systems Inc.,
said there is no evidence that any bets at Hollywood have come in
after horses have left the gate. Baedeker explained that because of
late money sent into the pools from off-track players at hundreds of
remote sites, it can take as long as 86 seconds before all the bets
show up on the Hollywood tote board.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Racing Assn., starting at its Aqueduct track on Dec.
4, will close betting to off-track players once the first horse
enters the starting gate. On-track bettors will still be able to bet
up to the time the race starts.</TE>
<TE>   There would have been drawbacks at Hollywood Park had the early
shutdown been approved. Besides the greater chances of more bettors
being shut out, bettors would not have had the luxury of backing
another horse if there was a late scratch at the gate, and a bettor
could have been stuck with the lesser half of a two-horse entry if
the stronger horse had been a gate scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Citing an informal poll of 300 patrons at his track last weekend,
Baedeker said customers need positive action to bolster their
confidence. The survey showed that 68% felt there are likely to be
fraudulent bets after the races start; and that 69% lacked confidence
in the tote system. Baedeker said that 53% favored an early betting
cutoff, while 40% were opposed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roger Licht, an attorney and racing commissioner since March 2001,
was elected to a one-year term, beginning in January, as chairman of
the California Horse Racing Board. John Harris was elected vice
chairman, a position Licht had held.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Adam Deadmarsh was still in a fog Thursday, unable to play because of
a concussion for the fourth consecutive game.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray didn't want to rule out a return to the lineup
Saturday night but indicated it was doubtful Deadmarsh would play
against the Dallas Stars in the Kings' first game at Staples Center
since Nov. 4.</LD>
<LD>   "We may have to get him on the ice for a series of practices
before we'd want to put him into a game," he said. "Once it goes more
than a week without playing or practicing, you almost need three or
four practices before the guy can play."</LD>
<TE>   Deadmarsh hasn't played since Nov. 12, when he scored two goals in
a 4-3 overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs.</TE>
<TE>   He was hit late in the game by defenseman Aki Berg of the Maple
Leafs, resulting in a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons ago, Deadmarsh sat out 14 games after suffering a
concussion in a fight with defenseman Ed Jovanovski of the Vancouver
Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   And what happened to Jovanovski?</TE>
<TE>   "He hurt his hand," Deadmarsh said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger couldn't practice Wednesday after suffering back
spasms while lacing his skates, but after taking muscle relaxants and
seeing a chiropractor he was able to play Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still tight, but once I get it warmed up, I'll be ready to
go," he said before the game. "It feels like something stabbed me.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long trip -- different beds, blah, blah, blah. And we've
played so many games. I'm sure it's fatigued."</TE>

<HD>Kings End It on Bad Note</HD>
<DH>They conclude 17-day trip by surrendering tying goal with
31 seconds left in regulation, lose to Blues in overtime, 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Eager to get home after eight games and 17 days on the road, the
Kings left something behind Thursday night in the Savvis Center.</LD>
<LD>   They failed to securely pack a victory over the St. Louis Blues,
giving up the tying goal to Doug Weight with 31 seconds to play in
regulation and the winner to Alexander Khavanov 62 seconds into
overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Their 3-2 loss was affixed to the record of goaltender Felix
Potvin, who deserved better after stopping 35 shots, 21 in a
third-period barrage.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure my teammates all feel the same way: We let him down the
way we played," King forward Ian Laperriere said. "That was his win.
He played unbelievably, but a couple mistakes at the end cost us the
game, cost him the game."</TE>
<TE>   Outshot, 23-3, over the final 20 minutes of regulation and 37-12
overall, the Kings still were less than a minute from winning in
front of 19,667 when defenseman Al MacInnis of the Blues launched a
shot from the right point. It deflected off the stick of teammate
Pavol Demitra right to Weight, who slapped it into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "They got a lucky bounce," King defenseman Mathieu Schneider said,
"but they could have scored three or four other goals before that."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a month on the road -- starting Oct. 23, they played 13 of
15 games away from home -- finally caught up to the Kings, Schneider
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was just a case of us running out of gas," he said of
the Blues' domination of the third period. "We had no jump left.
Simple things were becoming hard tasks for us out there. We just fell
apart."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin said he never saw the puck on the tying goal.</TE>
<TE>   He got a better look at the winner, scored from just outside the
crease by Khavanov off a pass from the corner by Petr Cajanek.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was in front," Potvin said of Khavanov. "I was trying
to time it and he just made a good shot, put it underneath my arm."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings ended the trip, their longest in 18 years, with a
2-3-1-2 record. They've won only three of 11 games since Jason
Allison was sidelined but reached their objective by going 5-5-2-3
over their last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   At 8-6-3-3 overall, with no trips of longer than two games
forthcoming until late February, they're two games above .500, as
they were a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that if we could get through this trip and have our heads
above water and be around that .500 mark, we would take that," Coach
Andy Murray said. "Look at what our team has battled through. I'm
proud of our effort on this road trip and what we've done."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Norton, who might not have been playing if Adam Deadmarsh
hadn't been sidelined because of a concussion, gave the Kings an
early lead when he scored his first NHL goal on a shot from the top
of the slot.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues outshot the Kings through the first two periods, but
only by 13-9. Then came the third period and their all-out blitz.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Boguniecki scored on a rebound at 4:12, tying the score.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings, who play five of their next six games at Staples
Center, took the lead again with 4:15 to play, defenseman Jaroslav
Modry scoring his eighth goal in 11 games off a pass from Erik
Rasmussen.</TE>

<HD>Comeback Player of Year?</HD>
<DH>O'Neal is expected to play against Bulls tonight. Jackson
says he's leaning toward bringing him off bench.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At what he believed to be the conclusion of one of the worst periods
of basketball in franchise history, Kobe Bryant had stood in the
middle of a locker room littered with wadded tape, crushed ice and
bowed teammates and, with a mocking smile, said, "We're going for a
four-peat. It's only right that we make the story really, really
difficult and complex. It has to happen."</LD>
<LD>   The next thematic turn could occur tonight, if Shaquille O'Neal
returns to a lineup sodden with nine losses -- one for each of his
unscarred toes -- and growing fatigued. The weeks of rehabilitation
were as hard on the 13 standing Lakers as they were on him, as it
turned out, and so they practiced Thursday somewhat encouraged by his
anticipated play against the Chicago Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal visited with his surgeon, Robert Mohr, the specialist at
UCLA Medical Center who cleared him earlier in the week, and received
a new set of orthotic devices, and now the final prerogative will be
O'Neal's, toe or no.</LD>
<TE>   Soaked in sweat Thursday afternoon, O'Neal waded through a tangle
of cameras and notepads, conducting an interview in the amount of
time it took him to travel from the door of the weight room to the
door of the trainer's room, about 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would gauge his toe this afternoon, after a morning
shoot-around, and decide whether to play then. Privately, he has told
friends that he intends to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "[The doctor] said everything looks OK," O'Neal said. "I played
today, felt pretty good. We'll just see tomorrow. That's all I'm
going to say."</TE>
<TE>   These things aren't ever easy with the Lakers, of course, and are
never lacking in drama.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just holding our breath until tomorrow," Coach Phil Jackson
said, though he didn't seem to mean it.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, according to Jackson and assuming O'Neal is ready, is to
play O'Neal about half the game. And he's leaning toward bringing the
center off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be upset about that," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, O'Neal is playing well enough, and is conditioned
enough, to return, and it's not as though the Lakers don't need him.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to get on a roll and we think we'll have a chance in
the season to do that," Jackson said. "Right now, we're just going to
play this like -- I'm not going to say exhibition season, but it's
kind of like getting back into form. So, we're not going to expect
too much out of ourselves. We're just going to go ahead and play the
game and bring [O'Neal] along the best we can, and progressively play
him if he improves."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago veteran Jalen Rose was not surprised with O'Neal's choice
in debuts, both in terms of the so-so Bulls and their 19-year-old
center, Eddy Curry.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't come back against Dallas," Rose said. "I think he
will play a lot of minutes. I think he's coming back to send a
message."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have three miserable weeks to put behind them, and 21
weeks in which to do it. They have fallen well behind Seattle and
Sacramento in the Pacific Division, as well as Dallas and San Antonio
in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, even their own sturdy perspective was tested.
Bryant was hard on his teammates for failing to make plays or shots.
Rick Fox had been suspended for the first six games, stressing an
already delicate offense. Devean George was injured and, last seen
Wednesday night, was shin-deep in a bucket of ice water, his head
resting in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Lakers have had little to defend themselves with.
A crowd in Dallas derided Bryant with chants of "Ko-bee! Ko-bee!",
and the next night another in San Antonio delighted in his 17 misses.
Their foes are only too delighted to take their free shots, on and
off the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Shaq, they're just another team," Dallas guard Steve Nash
said after a 26-point Maverick victory. "With Shaq, they're one of
the best teams in history. The operative word is team basketball. Is
Shaq synonymous with team basketball?"</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki cut it even closer.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is the Lakers, pretty much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They are in last place this deep into a season for the first time
since the 1993-94 season, and six games under .500 for the first time
since they were 33-39 in April of that season.</TE>
<TE>   At 3-9, they are a loss tonight from matching the worst 13-game
start by a defending champion, the 1999 Bulls, the team Jackson left
behind, and the 1969-70 Boston Celtics. It appears too, that if the
Lakers do four-peat, they'll win the fourth despite the most meager
first 20 games of any champion in NBA history. The 1946-47
Philadelphia Warriors began 11-9 and won the title.</TE>
<TE>   They arrive at O'Neal's season as the league's second-weakest
shooting team, and that's where he can help. He has led the league in
shooting percentage five consecutive years. There are other, less
quantifiable areas, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a lot of kinks to work through," Derek Fisher said.
"But I think things will run a little better defensively, having that
guy back there that opposing teams are afraid to attack.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things can change, but that doesn't mean we're going to
be the best basketball team in the league current day. We'll still
have a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Fox reminds them that it's one thing to ride around town with the
top down when the championship banners are flying and Randy Newman is
singing, quite another to do it when people "want to throw stuff in
the car," such as when they've lost seven of eight.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to think he's going to make a huge difference," Fox
said. "We still do have to play better. Our execution has to be
better. [But] I know it's going to lift our spirits for sure."</TE>

<HD>Miami Runs Around Pitt Fall</HD>
<DH>McGahee's 159 yards and two touchdowns help No. 1
Hurricanes hold off Panthers, 28-21, and improve to 10-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The 17th-ranked University of Pittsburgh football team came to the
Orange Bowl seeking respect. Instead, the Panthers spent Thursday
night seeking Miami running back Willis McGahee -- usually locating
him after the damage was done.</LD>
<LD>   McGahee rushed for 159 yards in 19 carries and scored two
touchdowns in a 28-21 victory, inching the No. 1 Hurricanes ever
closer to a spot in the national championship game.</LD>
<LD>   "That just shows what our offense is capable of," said McGahee,
who scored on runs of 69 and seven yards. "We just had to come out
and show America what we could do."</LD>
<TE>   But Miami players also learned what they can't do. Namely, turn on
the cruise control too soon. Pitt (8-3, 5-1), which entered the game
with a half-game lead in the Big East and designs on its first
conference title, made a strong run down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Down by two touchdowns for most of the fourth quarter, the
Panthers cut the deficit to 28-21 when quarterback Rod Rutherford
scored on a three-yard run with 4:37 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Miami got the ball back, drew a flag for holding and was unable to
get a first down, giving Pittsburgh another chance with 2:12 on the
clock. By that point, a light rain was falling, as were the yellow
flags. Miami was penalized three times in slightly more than two
minutes, keeping alive Pitt's hopes of pulling off an upset. The
Hurricanes have won 32 consecutive games, 20 in a row at home, and
have not lost to Pitt since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers worked the ball down to the Miami 20 but would get no
closer. On fourth and five with 20 seconds to play, Rutherford just
overthrew a diving Yogi Roth in the end zone, and the game was
essentially over.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not into moral victories," said Pitt Coach Walt Harris,
whose team has won 14 of 17 since starting last season 1-5. "These
guys are too serious about football to be excited about getting it
close. We were close but didn't get over the hump."</TE>
<TE>   Miami (10-0, 5-0) needs to win its two remaining games for a berth
in the Fiesta Bowl and the chance for another national title. The
victories haven't come as easily this season for the Hurricanes, who
beat Florida State by one point last month and, two games ago,
trailed Rutgers in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Pitt scare that included strong rushing performances
by Brandon Miree (118 yards in 26 carries) and Rutherford (69 in 21).
There would be no blowout this night, even though the Hurricanes were
favored by 20 1/2 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't played so many full games in my life," center Brett
Romberg said. "I've definitely earned my scholarship this year."</TE>
<TE>   Those close games have brought humility. This isn't an old style
Miami team, complete with chest-thumping celebrations after
meaningless tackles and an incessant flow of trash talk. These
Hurricanes are actually sort of humble, boring even.</TE>
<TE>   "We get some of the old-time guys that come back to practice and
tell us to talk more junk," safety Maurice Sikes said. "Guys like
Lamar Thomas, Yatil Green, Tremain Mack, they'll come back and say,
'Talk some noise.' But that's not us."</TE>
<TE>   There are vestiges of the classic Miami days. The sideline is
loaded with people during the game; among those lurking Thursday were
Dolphin receiver Cris Carter and former Hurricane and Cleveland Brown
quarterback Bernie Kosar.</TE>
<TE>   They were treated to some quick-strike theatrics from the
Hurricanes. Miami scored before its offense took the field. Less than
four minutes into the game, Roscoe Parrish fielded a punt and handed
off to Sean Taylor, who dashed up the sideline, then cut to the
middle of the field on his way to a 78-yard touchdown. Pittsburgh
evened the score later in the first quarter when Brian Beinecke
intercepted a Ken Dorsey pass, setting up a 34-yard touchdown drive
that ended with a five-yard alley-oop pass to Larry Fitzgerald, who
finished with a game-high seven catches for 74 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's scoring came in rapid-fire bursts. The three touchdown
drives by Miami's offense required 22 seconds, 1:42 and 1:47. Pitt's
time of possession was 38:41, Miami's 21:19.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee shrugged when asked about his touchdown runs. Just another
night's work. Asked recently what he thought about being a Heisman
Trophy candidate, he said, "I'm not sure. How do you get to be one?"</TE>
<TE>   After this night, no application required.</TE>

<LD>Annika Sorenstam was right where everyone expected her to be Thursday
-- on top of her game and at the top of the leaderboard in the
season-ending ADT Championship at West Palm Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise was who joined her.</LD>
<LD>   Se Ri Pak thought about going home before the first round even
started. She has an impacted tooth that has kept her from eating
solid food in the last week, leaving her body so weak that a golf
club felt as heavy as a sledge hammer.</LD>
<TE>   "It's too much pain," Pak said. "I shouldn't be here. However, I'm
here. I'll try my best."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam and Pak, the top two players on the LPGA Tour this year,
traded birdies and avoided major mistakes on a balmy, breezy day at
Trump International to tie for the lead at five-under-par 67, along
with Meg Mallon.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Karrie Webb had a three-under 69, despite
making bogey on the 18th hole and missing a 2-foot par putt on No.
14. She was joined by Kelly Robbins, Lorie Kane of Canada, Rosie
Jones and Patricia Meunier-Lebouc of France.</TE>

<TE>   Tiger Woods, in his first tournament since the Tour Championship
in Atlanta almost three weeks ago, settled for par 71 at the
$1.65-million Dunlop Phoenix at Miyazaki, Japan. He is seven strokes
behind leader Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, competing in his fifth Dunlop Phoenix, has a two-stroke
lead over England's Justin Rose and Japan's Kaname Yokoo and Tsukasa
Watanabe. Spanish star Sergio Garcia topped a five-player group at
67.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion David Duval shot a 69 with six birdies and two
bogeys.</TE>

<TE>   John Daly's mother died of lung cancer Thursday, and he said he'll
honor her wishes by continuing to play in the BMW Asian Open.</TE>
<TE>   Before the tournament began Thursday, Daly told reporters that his
65-year-old mother, Lou, was seriously ill with lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Before leaving on this three-week trip, I spoke to my mom, and
her words and wishes were that I should play in China, Taipei and
Australia," Daly said in a statement issued late Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   A man was convicted of assault for punching New York Yankee
pitcher David Wells and knocking out two of his teeth during an early
morning fight in a diner.</TE>
<TE>   Rocco Graziosa was acquitted of two other charges after a weeklong
trial in Manhattan Criminal Court. The jury deliberated less than
three hours. Graziosa, 27, could be sentenced to as much as a year in
jail at a Jan. 15 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Jose Navarro, a native of South-Central Los Angeles who fought in
the 2000 Olympics, will meet Benny Zepeda in the main event of a
six-bout card at Montebello's Quiet Cannon Country Club tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Navarro, 21, is 13-0 with five knockouts in his professional
career and Zepeda is 5-1-2 with four knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Navarro is a match against Oxnard's Carlos Madrigal
(20-3, 15 KO's) for the International Boxing Assn.'s intercontinental
115-pound title Jan. 16 at the Olympic Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia students set fires on campus and hundreds tore down
the goal posts at Mountaineer Field after the football team's upset
of No. 13 Virginia Tech on Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency dispatchers reported that at one point there were fires
burning throughout Morgantown, W.Va. Flames from one reached about 10
feet high.</TE>
<TE>   Three people were arrested, but the charges weren't disclosed.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andreas Johansson scored 14 seconds into the third period to help the
Nashville Predators to a 1-1 tie with the Colorado Avalanche on
Thursday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Blake had a first-period goal for the Avalanche, which
continued to struggle at home this season (1-4-4-1).</LD>
<LD>   Nashville goaltender Tomas Vokoun withstood Colorado's 9-3 edge in
shots in overtime, finishing with 31 saves.</LD>
<TE>   Patrick Roy had 29 saves, including a solid third period in which
his team was outshot, 14-2.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado had a power play for the final minute of overtime after
David Legwand went off for closing his hand on the puck, but the
Avalanche couldn't convert.</TE>
<TE>   Roy, who allowed four goals in each of his previous five starts,
decried his team's poor play in the final 20 minutes of regulation
time.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, we don't play well in the third," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roy withstood Nashville's onslaught in the third period, capped by
stops on consecutive shots from close range by Vladimir Orszagh.</TE>
<TE>   Blake scored 3:51 into the game. Milan Hejduk put two shots on
goal, the second one from left of the goal into the crease, where
Blake punched it in for his second goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Carolina 1 -- Glen Murray scored his 200th and 201st
career goals, and Brian Rolston added a short-handed goal as the
Bruins won at Boston in front of the second-smallest FleetCenter
crowd, 10,677. In the last three weeks, the Bruins have had their
smallest and second-smallest crowds since their arena opened in 1995.
Against the Ducks on Oct. 31, the Bruins drew 9,491.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Montreal 2 -- Chris Phillips scored his first goal of
the season late in the second period to help the Senators win at
Ottawa and extend their unbeaten streak to five. Montreal's Jeff
Hackett lost for the second time in 10 games as he made his second
start in as many nights in place of injured goalie Jose Theodore (hip
flexor).</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 4, New Jersey 4 -- Mark Messier scored on a
backhander in close with 3:35 left in regulation to give the Rangers
a tie at East Rutherford, N.J. The Rangers took advantage of a rare
bad game by Devil goaltender Martin Brodeur. New York took 27 shots,
including the only five shots in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Philadelphia 2 -- Jeremy Roenick's power-play goal
with 7:29 left in regulation at Philadelphia lifted the Flyers into
their fourth tie in five games. Before Roenick's goal, Philadelphia
hadn't scored in 32 power-play opportunities, including its first
four against the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Washington 3 -- Pascal Dupuis had a goal and two
assists as the Wild won at Washington. The Capitals failed to score
on their power plays and are in a nine-for-78 slump. The Wild has
killed 21 straight penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Calgary 1 -- Todd Marchant scored twice and set up
Shawn Horcoff's tiebreaking goal as the Oilers won at Calgary,
Canada, to stretch the Flames' losing streak to seven games.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 7, Tampa Bay 2 -- Jason Blake had two goals and
two assists, and Jason Wiemer added a goal and three assists as the
Islanders won at Tampa, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Otis Might Be Rehired as Coach at Dominguez</HD>
<DH>He built high school basketball power in Compton before a
controversial departure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coach whose final days on the job were racked by controversy and
whose dismissal nearly two years ago led to the breakdown of his
school's nationally renowned basketball program appears close to
getting his old position back.</LD>
<LD>   At a school board meeting Monday, the Compton Unified School
District is expected to approve the hiring of Russell Otis as coach
of the Dominguez High boys' team, sources close to the basketball
program said.</LD>
<LD>   Otis, 40, was coach of the Dons for 13 seasons, guiding them to
four state championships and a No. 1 final national ranking in 2000,
before he was arrested in November of that year and later charged
with sexually molesting a former player.</LD>
<TE>   He vigorously denied the allegations and a jury later acquitted
him. But Otis was fired in February 2001 because school officials
said he had failed to obtain a permanent teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Jesse Gonzalez, superintendent of the Compton school
district, nor Kelcey Richardson, Dominguez's principal, would comment
about Otis. Gonzalez did not return phone messages and his secretary
refused to schedule a meeting with a reporter. Richardson declined
repeated interview requests.</TE>
<TE>   A source with ties to the district said officials were trying to
keep the coach's nomination quiet to avoid public debate before his
candidacy was considered by the school board.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want the process to be polluted to the extent that
people are getting calls from [school officials in] Sacramento and
other places saying, 'We don't want this guy back,' " the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Otis spent last school year as a teacher at Gardena High. He has
finished his work on acquiring a permanent teaching credential and
soon expects to receive written documentation by mail, a source said.
Reached at his home, Otis declined to comment on the Dominguez job.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't Otis' first attempt at regaining his old position. Otis
requested reinstatement as coach in July 2001, but Randolph Ward, the
state administrator who ran the school district at the time, instead
hired Mack Calvin, a former USC standout and longtime NBA assistant
coach.</TE>
<TE>   With Calvin, the Dons finished 15-12 last season, losing more
games than they had in the previous three seasons combined. Then,
citing a need to attend to personal priorities, Calvin resigned last
month. That opened the door for Gonzalez and several members of the
school board, which has reassumed control of the district, to
spearhead a drive to bring back Otis.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the sexual molestation charges were leveled, Otis
remained wildly popular in Compton, credited with building the
Dominguez team into more than just a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "Next to the Williams sisters and rap music, the Dominguez
basketball team is the best thing to happen to Compton," the Los
Angeles Sentinel, a leading African American newspaper, wrote.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Otis won with local talent. But later he began to
attract top players from other areas, such as eventual NBA lottery
pick Tyson Chandler, who lived in San Bernardino when he first
attended Dominguez. Nike also played a role by supplying the Dons
with footwear and uniforms -- and by giving Otis a lucrative
consultant's contract.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez won a third consecutive state title in 2001 under
interim coach Steve Singleton, previously an assistant to Otis. But
the Dons fell fast from glory last season, playing before half-empty
gyms and losing in the second round of the Southern Section Division
III-AA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Things could get even worse for Dominguez this season --
especially if a new coach isn't in place before its opener Dec. 2.
The Dons return three starters, most notably Travon Free, a 6-foot-7
senior forward who has committed to Long Beach State, but they still
seem to lack the talent required to make a run deep into the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Former Don basketball player Joey Aubrey and his father, Horace,
have conducted informal practices this week as interim coaches. Joey,
who played for Otis in the 1998-99 season, said a permanent coach
should be in place as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The team needs a coach to give them some direction to give them a
shot at winning league and even going into the playoffs," he said.
"They're hearing a whole bunch of different things about who's going
to be the head coach ... so I know it has to be frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey said he would like to see Otis return as coach. "He
deserves it," Aubrey said. "It would stabilize the program."</TE>
<TE>   Otis' coaching peers have little doubt he could quickly restore
the program to national prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody can do it, I know he can," said Compton Centennial
Coach Rod Palmer. "It's going to take a couple of years, but he knows
the blueprint already."</TE>
<TE>   Said Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight: "He's so ingrained
in that area, just his name attracts a lot of players. I would think
he could get it going again."</TE>

<HD>Time for Clippers to Stop Whining, Start Working</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe something is getting lost in the translation. Or maybe I know
too many people who, in the face of demoralizing working conditions,
continue to honor their paycheck and their pride.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the reason, when it comes to the Clippers, I just don't
get it.</LD>
<LD>   They are saying their early-season troubles are related to last
summer's failed contract negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   I am hearing an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   They are intimating that it's difficult to play as a team if you
are not sure how long your team will stay together.</TE>
<TE>   I'm thinking, in what other line of work is it acceptable to blow
off November because you are worried about next June?</TE>
<TE>   They are fumbling rebounds and losing passes while pointing
fingers at their owner and their salaries.</TE>
<TE>   I'm thinking, shut up and play.</TE>
<TE>   I know I'm on dangerous ground here, messing with this town's
darlings, these poor guys who have been so terribly mistreated for so
long.</TE>
<TE>   This is even more tricky when it could be viewed as an endorsement
of Donald Sterling, which it certainly is not. By failing to sign
Michael Olowokandi or Elton Brand this summer, he has shown yet again
that his ownership is not to be trusted, again making his fans look
like fools.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, how about sprinkling the condemnations with a little
common sense?</TE>
<TE>   How about holding the players accountable for, I don't know,
something?</TE>
<TE>   Fans in this town booed Devon White for not working for his $5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they forgive Olowokandi for saying he's distracted while
playing for $6.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   They still boo Rob Blake for turning down $21.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they feel sympathy toward Elton Brand when he turns down $60
million.</TE>
<TE>   It's amazing what people will forgive in professional basketball
players that they would never forgive in themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Your boss is a jerk and you haven't had a raise in two years and
your morale stinks and what do you do?</TE>
<TE>   I'm guessing you still show up for work every morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have all had nice raises, with guaranteed contracts
for this season, but the boss refuses to meet their future salary
demands, so what do they do?</TE>
<TE>   They blow the opener against Cleveland, fail to show up in
Portland, lose a big lead against Seattle, botch a chance to beat
short-handed Sacramento. They are a potential playoff team now 4-8.</TE>
<TE>   Yet everyone blames the boss.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Sterling was a short-sighted fool for not increasing his
$60-million offer to Brand by $10 million, thus ensuring that their
hardest-working player sticks around.</TE>
<TE>   And, certainly, Sterling was downright derelict in not coming
within $15 million of Olowokandi's $75-million request, almost
ensuring that he will lose one of the league's top centers.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Clippers to blame their current problems on these
potential problems is like a guy taking the afternoon off because
he's worried about getting mugged that night.</TE>
<TE>   Could the Clippers at least finish their shift?</TE>
<TE>   And about that mugging, it isn't as if the entire Clipper team is
getting tossed into a dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an examination of their contracts shows that, for all the
league legalese being thrown out this summer, the only two impact
players who could actually, physically walk away are Olowokandi and
Eric Piatkowski.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette, Andre Miller, Lamar Odom and Brand all must stay
through next season if the Clippers want them to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Yet listening to all the media buzz around the league, you would
think that any minute, the entire franchise will disappear.</TE>
<TE>   How hard must it be for the Clippers to play, knowing they could
all be gone!</TE>
<TE>   Please.</TE>
<TE>   Brand is making $4.9 million this season. Miller is making $2.5
million. Maggette is making $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   They survive these unstable times simply by honoring those numbers
and the fans who help pay them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely putting all this stuff in the back of my mind, the
only important thing is to win," Olowokandi said Wednesday after the
Clippers blew a fourth-quarter lead in an avoidable loss to the
Sacramento Kings. "But one is human, after all. That's the human part
of everyone. Everyone who is saying they're not thinking about this
at all is flat lying."</TE>
<TE>   Agreed.</TE>
<TE>   But winners forget such things long enough to block out on a free
throw, something the Clippers failed to do in a key miscommunication
against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Winners forget such things long enough to help out on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Winners don't use excuses.</TE>
<TE>   And winning coaches don't allow them.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Gentry was stern about this Wednesday, saying contracts
weren't an issue, and shouldn't be an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry needs to remain tough, allow no alibis, fight to keep
focus.</TE>
<TE>   If his players' attitude is going to eventually roast this good
guy -- and you know it will -- the least he can do is make them
equally uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in the end, the players will win.</TE>
<TE>   Being a Clipper means never having to take the blame for anything.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for this sorry franchise means never having to say you're
sorry.</TE>

<HD>Costly Losses to USC Still Bothering Him</HD>

<LD>Troy Aikman, now a football analyst for Fox, won three Super Bowls as
quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. As for his two games against USC
when he was playing for UCLA in 1987 and '88, well, those were the
ones that got away.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Three Super Bowl rings, two bowl victories, a 20-4
record as a starter at UCLA, yet you never beat USC. Does that bother
you?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: What bothers me the most about my collegiate career is I
didn't take the team to the Rose Bowl. Had we have won either one of
those USC games, we would have gone to the Rose Bowl. My junior year,
I thought we were the better team. It was 10-0 at halftime and we
just had a complete collapse -- I had a complete collapse -- in the
second half, and wound up losing that game at the Coliseum. My senior
year, I thought SC had the better team, and we played better. We
played a lot better in that game, but we couldn't get it done.</LD>
<TE>   Q: If you could change a play in either of those games, what would
it be?</TE>
<TE>   A: Probably my junior year when we played at the Coliseum. The
play that sticks out in my mind is [USC receiver Erik] Affholter
caught a pass and he was out of bounds. It was ruled a touchdown.
That had a huge impact on the outcome of the game. I'm not blaming
the officials or anything; it happens, and there wasn't replay at the
time. In fact, I'm an advocate of no replay in the NFL. But that was
a game when it worked against me and our team.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why don't you like instant replay?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think it slows the game. There's mistakes at every level,
when you're talking about the players, the coaches. It happens with
officials. I think for the most part they do an awfully good job. I
think there are still flaws in the system. My thoughts are, if you
can't get all the calls right all the time, you shouldn't have some
of the calls right some of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's a better future home for an NFL team, the Coliseum or
the Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm partial to the Rose Bowl. I not only played there in
college, but I played there in our first Super Bowl. To me, there's
nothing better than that. I'd be an advocate of saying they should
play every Super Bowl there. I think it's as good a setting as there
is.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You had 10 concussions during your pro career. Is the NFL doing
enough to protect quarterbacks?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think they're doing everything they can do. It's a physical
game. It's a vulnerable position, because so many times you don't see
the hits coming because you're focused downfield. More so than any
other position. I don't know what safeties are supposed to do. I
think there are times when you can say, hey, this guy blatantly came
in with the crown of the helmet and made helmet-to-helmet contact on
a defenseless receiver. But I've seen calls made where guys are just
going for the ball and making good plays. That's part of it. I think
they've gone a little too far. I've said it -- and I don't mean it
jokingly -- but if they don't want the helmet to be used as a weapon,
they ought to go back to leather helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When Jay Fiedler went down, the Dolphins were flirting with the
idea of signing you. How interested are you in coming out of
retirement?</TE>
<TE>   A: It could have happened. In fact, it could have happened as
early as this week. But it wasn't right for me. Knowing that, and
knowing I had some chances to come back and play if I wanted to do
it, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm finished playing. I can't
imagine anything changing that. Let's be honest, if someone came and
made a substantial offer and really enticed me with something, then I
could come back and play. I guess it would be easier for me to say,
"Look, I'm done." And then if that ever happened, then just come back
and say, "Well, this is why I came back."</TE>
<TE>   Q: So you've still got something left?</TE>
<TE>   A: When I retired I didn't intend to come back and play, and I
still don't intend to come back and play, but that doesn't mean that
I couldn't if I chose to do it. Because I'm still physically capable,
and I'm young enough [36] that I could.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's so hard about giving up football?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's hard on everybody on some level. It's something I've been
doing since I was 7 years old. I'm fortunate in that when I retired I
had something I could go right into. It has occupied a lot of my
time. It's kept me busy. Most guys don't readily get into something
that's challenging for them. They always kind of hang on to the
playing days. I haven't done that. But there's no question that when
we're done with a broadcast, and I put my headset on the table, it's
over. It's over for me. I get in my car, go to the airport and go
home. And I don't have any feelings whatsoever as to who won that
game and who lost. I think the emotional part of it as an athlete is
the thing that you miss. I miss the highs of winning, and I even miss
the lows of losing at times.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What should the Cowboys do about Emmitt Smith after this
season?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you're a football team that's struggling like the Cowboys
are, then at some point you've got to make a youth movement. I think
it's important that guys realize it is a business. I never lost sight
of that; I hope Emmitt never lost sight of that. At some point
everyone becomes expendable, and at some point you're no longer a
valuable commodity to that club. I think Emmitt's reached that point,
and he had a tremendous career. Obviously, he's the record holder for
yards rushing in the NFL. But this team is going in a little
different direction and they need to find the running back that's
going to be running the football for them for the next five, six,
seven years. And Emmitt's not going to be that guy. And when he's
counting $10 million against the cap, for what is now a part-time
player, is unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So he's gone?</TE>
<TE>   A: If he's willing to take a tremendous pay cut he'll be back. But
then what's that? That's just playing for the sake of playing. That's
what I didn't want to get into. People always ask: Do you miss
playing? I don't miss playing, I miss winning. I played my last few
years and that was miserable. So, for Emmitt just to go out there and
say, 'Well, I'm playing.' I don't know what that means. But that's
something he's going to have to answer for himself.</TE>

<HD>Tennis Relocation Called Risky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its centerpiece event, the JPMorgan Chase Open, moving about 10
miles to Carson, Manhattan Country Club's general manager called it a
"huge risk" on the part of IMG, which owns and operates the
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which will occur next year, became official with an
announcement Thursday. After 21 years at Manhattan Country Club in
Manhattan Beach, the women's summer tour stop will be at the
8,000-seat tennis stadium at the Home Depot Center in Carson. The
dates are Aug. 4-10 and the tournament usually features a strong
field tuning up for the U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been a popular, celebrated community event," said Andrew
Scott, the club's general manager. "You can relocate the tournament.
You can't relocate the community. We believe IMG is taking a huge
risk by relocating."</LD>
<TE>   IMG's Eric van Dillen agreed -- to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a risk, but there's a risk in staying," said Van
Dillen, a senior corporate vice president. "It's a very, very good
risk. The upside could be fantastic. If women's tennis is as great a
product as we think, it is the only choice."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said 40% of ticket sales in past tournaments came from club
membership, which was crucial for the commercial viability of day
sessions. He doubted that many of the MCC members during the day
would drive to watch players not ranked in the top five and also took
note of the poor attendance for the WTA Championships at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Carson event, unlike Staples, is outdoors in the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If attendance at the Staples Center is any indication of future
attendance at the Carson center, we won't be surprised if IMG comes
back to MCC in future years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Van Dillen: "By going down there, we have access to a much
bigger broader base of people in Orange County. We have to do a good
job of marketing."</TE>
<TE>   The marketing budget for the event could double, he said. IMG and
the sponsors of the tournament had thought about making the move in a
year or two, but Van Dillen said everyone was ready to move forward
after recently visiting the tennis venue under construction at the
$130-million multisports complex.</TE>

<DH>No one likes to say a team quit, but Bruins gave every
indication of it during last year's 27-0 loss to USC</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours before last year's big game, the UCLA football team was milling
around the Coliseum, checking the field, when the USC players
arrived. As is their custom, the Trojans entered the stadium by
walking en masse down the peristyle steps.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, the rivals stood face to face.</LD>
<LD>   "We were staring each other down," former USC defensive back
Antuan Simmons recalled. "Somebody might have said something."</LD>
<TE>   Radio commentator Matt Stevens, standing on the sideline for his
pregame show, glanced around for security guards, thinking a brawl
might erupt.</TE>
<TE>   Then something unexpected happened. As Stevens saw it, the Bruins
quietly parted to let their opponents through.</TE>
<TE>   "They just sort of backed off," said Stevens, a quarterback at
UCLA in the mid-1980s. "The teams I played for, there would have been
a confrontation. But last year's team had no fight in them."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans won, 27-0. With the schools set to renew their
cross-town rivalry at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, people still talk
about the game as an anomaly, a glitch in an otherwise storied
history between these schools.</TE>
<TE>   It was the widest margin of victory in more than two decades and
the first shutout since 1954. Beyond the numbers, there was little of
the intensity, the back-and-forth action, that fans expect.</TE>
<TE>   "I never use the words 'give up' because I don't want to hang
something like that on kids," said Artie Gigantino, a former USC
assistant and current Fox Sports Net analyst. "But, no, I'd never
seen a USC-UCLA game like that. I just think UCLA was in a state of
shock."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens was harsher. "I saw half of the UCLA players trying," he
said. "I saw the other half quitting."</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, there was good reason to expect a mismatch.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans came in on a roll, rebounding from a shaky start to
win four of five games. The players were growing comfortable with new
Coach Pete Carroll and, the week before, had flattened lowly
California, 55-14.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cal game was big because we won in big fashion," receiver
Keary Colbert said. "That always gives you confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were headed the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   They had started by winning six in a row and climbing to No. 4 in
the polls. Then came losses to Stanford, Washington State and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, tailback DeShaun Foster was caught driving a Ford
Expedition lent to him by a Hollywood director and was suspended for
the rest of the season. Two days before the USC game, the team
learned that quarterback Cory Paus had been hiding two
alcohol-related driving convictions and was facing jail time.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy only intensified when Coach Bob Toledo decided to
let Paus play.</TE>
<TE>   All of this pressure came to bear on a Bruin roster loaded with
seniors who could, if they so chose, look ahead to the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we had some issues at the end of the season," said
former quarterback Scott McEwan, who replaced Paus in the fourth
quarter. "We just didn't have any momentum whatsoever. It was a
downhill spiral from the kickoff."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans drove 80 yards on the opening possession, Carson
Palmer throwing a short touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead. Paus, on the
other hand, was having the worst game of his career, pestered by
effective and persistent blitzes.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA tight end Mike Seidman insists none of his teammates let up.
But, by most accounts, a freak play at the end of the first quarter
extinguished whatever fire the Bruins could muster.</TE>
<TE>   It was a simple pattern, Paus throwing toward the sideline. The
pass thudded off receiver Brian Poli-Dixon's shoulder pads.</TE>
<TE>   As the ball fell toward the ground, Simmons swiped at it with one
hand and trapped it against the outside of his knee. He brought it
around behind him and up through his legs.</TE>
<TE>   Poli-Dixon made no move to tackle the defensive back. He simply
stood there, spitting out his mouthpiece, as Simmons took off toward
the end zone to give his team a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, the whole thing happened in front of the UCLA bench.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big deal," Toledo recalled. "A weird play. It really
turned the momentum."</TE>
<TE>   USC offensive lineman Zach Wilson waited for the Bruins to mount a
comeback, waited for the kind of turnaround that -- growing up in
Southern California -- he recalled from cross-town games over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA managed only 28 yards on the ground -- not much more by
air -- and never drove inside the USC 20-yard line. Though no one
likes to use the word "quit" with high-caliber athletes, Seidman said
afterward: "It seemed like we weren't there ... we didn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   In the other locker room, USC players talked about looking across
the line of scrimmage and seeing rivals who had "checked out" and
"lost interest."</TE>
<TE>   "It never really seemed like they wanted it real bad," Palmer said
at the time. "You could tell by the way our line was pushing them
around. It just didn't seem like they were hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Gigantino could not help comparing the game to others he had
coached and watched.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit surprised," he said. "These games have always
been so competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the funny part: A year later, USC players are not eager to
relive their dominant performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to forget about it," Wilson said. "They were having some
tough times last year, but it's not like that now."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bruins have won three consecutive games on the way to a
7-3 record. And, as dreary as the memory of last year might be, they
don't want to forget. As Seidman explained after a recent practice:
"Any competitor is going to remember what happened and use that to
fuel the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens goes a step further, suggesting the pain of that shutout
laid the groundwork for the entire season.</TE>
<TE>   This year's team is playing as if it has something to prove, he
said. The Bruins are more physical, especially in the fourth quarter,
and exhibit what the commentator called "a huge heartbeat."</TE>
<TE>   So, even though the Trojans are ranked seventh and favored to win
Saturday, Stevens expects a game befitting the USC-UCLA rivalry. In
other words, nothing like last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a one-time deal," he said. "I don't think you'll ever
get another one like that."</TE>

<HD>At This Point, It Looks Like Anybody's Guess</HD>
<DH>USC basketball team has holes to fill, and atop list is
finding a floor leader to replace Granville.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Bibby has a new toy ... or three.</LD>
<LD>   For four seasons, the USC men's basketball coach leaned on Brandon
Granville, his reliable if unspectacular point guard, knowing exactly
what he had.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby, a former point guard who won championships in college, the
NBA and the CBA, and the diminutive Granville, the Trojans' first
four-year starting point guard in nearly 20 years, had a unique
relationship that more resembled Dr. Evil and Mini-Me than
father-son.</LD>
<TE>   But the graduation of the 5-foot-9 Granville left a hole not only
in Bibby's heart, but in his game plan as USC prepares to open its
season tonight against UC Riverside with a roster full of question
marks, none as large as the one at the point.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, losing power forward Sam Clancy, last season's Pacific 10
Conference player of the year, and small forward David Bluthenthal
stings. But how does Bibby replace a floor general who left campus as
the school record holder in assists (779), steals (229),
three-pointers (218), minutes (4,043) and games (124) and was the
Trojans' No. 8 all-time scorer with 1,430 points?</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's answer: take three capable point guards in senior Robert
Hutchinson, sophomore Derrick Craven and junior college transfer
Brandon Brooks, roll out the ball and see who emerges with the
starting position.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be interesting," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three, Hutchinson is a known quantity, a solid,
play-it-close-to-the-vest veteran whose game most resembles
Granville's.</TE>
<TE>   Craven is a bulked-up defensive terror who is learning the
position on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks is a high school All-American who has not played organized
ball in two years but has been viewed as an NBA prospect by scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "They're athletic, they're quicker, they're more crafty than
Brandon was," Bibby said. "Brandon was fairly limited and when you're
limited you don't do a lot of things on the floor. I can kind of
equate that to when I played.</TE>
<TE>   "I was an average ballplayer that wasn't fancy, wasn't super
quick, wasn't athletic. So Brandon and I hit it off and I knew what
he was doing. Now it's a little different.</TE>
<TE>   "The other guys, especially [Brooks] and Derrick, can do so many
things out there. They can break people down, they can get to the
basket, they can make that extra pass, they can dunk the basketball,
they can steal the basketball, they're quick enough to chase you from
behind."</TE>
<TE>   The first five weeks of practice and two exhibitions have provided
more questions than answers.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has said that Brooks was third on the depth chart, then
proclaimed him his starter at Pac-10 media day; started Hutchinson in
the exhibition opener, and then started Craven for the second
exhibition after suspending Brooks for the game for missing class.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very intense because coach said he isn't happy with any of
the point guards right now.... He says he could start anybody at this
point," said Hutchinson, who was named team captain last year, then
started only once and played 11.7 minutes a game. "He wants a leader
on this team, a leader on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be like this all season. He's never going to let
his guard down."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson has an experience edge, having been in Bibby's system
for two full seasons. It was Hutchinson who stepped up for the
Trojans in the 2001 NCAA tournament when he came in for Granville,
who'd fouled out, and converted five of six free throws in the final
77 seconds of USC's 74-71 second-round win over Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   But can the 6-1, 185-pound Hutchinson lead the Trojans -- picked
by the media to finish sixth in a watered-down Pac-10 -- to the NCAA
tournament for a school-record third straight season?</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Bibby has been raving about Craven, who spent his summer
lifting weights, gained 30 pounds of muscle and had seven steals in
an exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "That's also why I got in the weight room, because they're not as
big as I am and as quick as I am," said the 6-2, 200-pound Craven,
who had been more of a combo guard than a point guard. "As big as I
am now, and as quick as I am, I can rebound too.</TE>
<TE>   "[Bibby] wants me to make the open shot but not really be a
scorer. Control the tempo of the game and just be a coach out there.
That's what coach likes about me and that's why a big part of my game
is my defense. If I make a turnover, I've got to get the ball back."</TE>
<TE>   The wild card in the race is Brooks, a slasher and scorer who
signed with Arizona State out of high school but bounced around to
three junior colleges, playing at one, before arriving at USC.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling around Heritage Hall is that Bibby will give his
senior the start tonight, go to a point-guard-by-committee approach
during the nonconference schedule and wait for Brooks to win the job
in time for Pac-10 play.</TE>
<TE>   That sounds fine with Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "My ultimate goal is to win [games] but of course I'm shooting to
be the starting point guard," said Brooks, who acknowledged that his
being suspended had left him behind Hutchinson and Craven.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're on the court, we're not really friends but I respect
them. With that said, I'm still trying to be the starting point guard
and I feel as we progress ... I'll be the starting point guard."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks averaged 14.7 points and 7.6 assists at Indian Hills
College two years ago, after having averaged 21 points, nine assists
and four steals while leading Jefferson High to the state title as
Oregon's high school player of the year in 2000. Hutchinson has
career numbers at USC of 1.5 points and 1.2 assists and Craven, who
was slowed by a stress fracture in his right leg last season,
averaged 0.3 points and one assist in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got respect for Derrick and Hutch," Brooks said, "but I
can't say nothing but, 'May the best man win.' "</TE>

<HD>NATO Grows, Shifts Focus to Terrorism</HD>
<DH>The alliance invites seven nations to join, expanding its
reach beyond old Soviet borders. Its leaders issue a warning to Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>NATO leaders approved a historic expansion Thursday that will take
the alliance beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union and,
moving even further from the old Cold War posture, endorsed a shift
in emphasis toward fighting terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In what Bush administration officials saw as an important
diplomatic success, the leaders also warned Iraq to give up all
weapons of mass destruction, approving a statement demanding that
Iraq "comply fully and immediately" with disarmament demands in a
recent U.N. resolution.</LD>
<LD>   "A deadly cocktail of threats is now menacing free societies,"
NATO Secretary-General George Robertson declared in opening the
summit. "Terrorists and their backers, the failed states in which
they flourish and proliferating weapons of mass destruction pose a
genuine threat.... A transformed and modernized alliance is at the
very heart of the free world's response."</LD>
<TE>   The 19-nation alliance issued membership invitations to seven
formerly Communist-ruled countries, including the three Baltic
states, which once were part of the Soviet Union, the enemy that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed to stand against.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO leaders pledged Thursday to build more mobile and
high-tech forces, and streamline command structures, to cope with new
threats wherever they arise. They also stressed that enlargement is
meant to consolidate democracy and stability in Europe, not threaten
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "By welcoming seven members, we will not only add to our military
capabilities, we will refresh the spirit of this great democratic
alliance," President Bush said. "We believe today's decision
reaffirms our commitment to freedom and our commitment to a Europe
which is whole and free and at peace."</TE>
<TE>   The leaders' statement on Iraq set the stage for members to
contribute to a U.S.-led war effort if Baghdad flouts the U.N.
demands but stopped far short of pledging NATO to fight as an
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania were invited
to join, as were Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. They are
due to join by May 2004, after their parliaments and those of current
members ratify the enlargement.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be no exaggeration to compare today's decision on the
enlargement of NATO with the fall of the Berlin Wall," Bulgarian
President Georgi Parvanov said.</TE>
<TE>   Enlargement marks a "historic moment when Europe is finally
reunited, and when Europe and North America reassert the inseparable
nature of their security," French President Jacques Chirac said.</TE>
<TE>   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security advisor, described the
meeting to reporters as "the most historic summit since NATO's
founding in 1949."</TE>
<TE>   "As we sit here today to celebrate the spread of freedom across
this European continent, we should not forget that there are people
in the world who still live in tyranny and despotism, and, of course,
the people of Iraq are among those people," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The invitees' leaders expressed joy that their nations would no
longer feel shunned by the continent's richer and more established
democracies.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, we are not the unwanted child of Europe, a country on
the periphery," Romanian President Ion Iliescu told reporters
Thursday. "Now we are calm and happy."</TE>
<TE>   The incoming members celebrated joining what they see as not just
the world's premier security organization but also a kind of elite
club that provides a stamp of democratic legitimacy and promotes full
integration in Western economic and political life.</TE>
<TE>   Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga said her nation does not
want to be "left out in the outer darkness."</TE>
<TE>   "Latvia lost its independence for a very long time, and it knows
the meaning of liberty and the loss of it," she told the NATO
leaders. "Being invited to an alliance that ensures our security is a
momentous occasion in the history of Latvia. This is a great day for
Latvia.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that this step will be a reminder to those forces in
Russia who may still think in terms of the former Soviet empire that
those days are gone."</TE>
<TE>   But Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus offered reassuring words
to Moscow, which has watched unhappily as NATO expanded first to
Russia's borders, with the 1999 inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic, and now beyond the old Soviet frontier. "This is not
a Cold War NATO," Adamkus said, stressing that he believes Russia
wishes to integrate peacefully with Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow, while not pleased about NATO expansion, has muted its
criticism for a variety of reasons, ranging from acceptance of the
inevitable to a belief that Russia's future lies in cooperation, not
confrontation, with the rest of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "The remarkable thing about this is that it has been done in a
framework that allowed not just the entry of the seven new states
into NATO, but the reconciliation of NATO with Russia in the new
Russia-NATO Council," Rice said. The council -- a consultative body
on issues such as counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and missile defense
-- was set up in May.</TE>
<TE>   The summit was rich in historical resonance: Soviet-led forces
crushed the liberalizing "Prague Spring" effort here in 1968, and it
was here that the Warsaw Pact, NATO's decades-long foe, was
dissolved. Czech President Vaclav Havel, who hosted Thursday's
summit, and Romanian President Iliescu were among those leaders who
signed the Moscow-led bloc out of existence.</TE>
<TE>   "A clear signal is given not only for all Europeans but for the
entire world that the era when countries were divided by force into
spheres of influence or when the strong were used to subjugate the
weaker has come to an end once and for all," Havel said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 protesters who see NATO as a bully took to the streets
of Prague in several groups Thursday, but that was only a fraction of
what police had prepared for. Most of the demonstrators tried to
approach the conference center where the summit was being held, and
police lines stopped them. Some protesters seemed interested in
trying to break through, but organizers warned against any clash.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no war against terrorism," one of the rally speakers
said. "The war is against innocent people." Security helicopters
flying overhead sometimes drowned out speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the protesters were pushing for change more than opposing
the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "NATO is probably something necessary, but I would like to show my
disagreement with the system in our society," said a 22-year-old
Czech theology student who gave only her first name, Viola. "And I do
not like it that the USA exploits poor states, and in the name of
freedom makes war but the real reason is profits."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the alliance also approved the creation of a
20,000-strong rapid reaction force with a global reach, a plan that
buries its old reluctance to act outside its own territory or
immediate region.</TE>
<TE>   "NATO must be able to field forces that can move quickly to
wherever they are needed ... to sustain operations over distance and
time, including in an environment where they might be faced with
nuclear, biological and chemical threats," the leaders said in the
summit's main declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Member states committed themselves to improving their military
capabilities to face myriad 21st century threats. Pledges were made
in areas such as strategic airlift of heavy equipment, air-to-air
refueling, surveillance systems and precision weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders agreed to streamline NATO command structures, with a
U.S. general to be appointed strategic commander for worldwide
operations. They also agreed to study how NATO could join America in
building a multinational missile-defense system.</TE>
<TE>   "The attacks of Sept. 11 and those since in Bali, Moscow and
elsewhere highlight the threat to our values and peoples from
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction," British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said. "We must adapt accordingly, providing the maximum
protection for our people while preserving the values which
terrorists seek to destroy. In this struggle, NATO's responsibility
is clear."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not business as usual," Robertson said, "but the
emergence of a new and modernized NATO, fit for the challenges of the
new century."</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Figure in Custody</HD>
<DH>Capture of the alleged mastermind of the Cole attack is a
'serious blow' to terrorists, U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities said Thursday that they have captured a top Al Qaeda
leader who allegedly masterminded the 2000 attack on the U.S.
destroyer Cole and is a suspect in the 1998 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa.</LD>
<LD>   Abd al Rahim al Nashiri was identified as one of a dozen key
terrorist leaders about whom the FBI had been seeking information.
Federal law enforcement officials called his recent arrest a major
setback to Osama bin Laden's continuing plans to strike again.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a serious blow to Al Qaeda and a significant success in
the fight against terrorism to catch a guy like this," said one
high-placed official.</LD>
<TE>   Word of the capture surfaced last week. At that time,
congressional Democrats were questioning the wisdom of starting a war
with Iraq when many senior Al Qaeda leaders were still on the loose
and a fresh audiotape from Bin Laden threatened more strikes against
the U.S. and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to their critics, Bush administration officials
insisted that they had made progress in combating Al Qaeda. Unnamed
officials were quoted in press reports as saying a senior Al Qaeda
member had been captured, but they refused to name him. On Sunday,
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge confirmed that a top Al Qaeda
member had been apprehended but again declined to give details. Ridge
said the detainee was providing U.S. interrogators with insight into
Al Qaeda's operations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials continued to provide few details of the capture or
of Nashiri's status Thursday. They said he was arrested this month at
an undisclosed location abroad and is in U.S. custody, although
officials refused to say where he was being held, or why they were
confirming his identity now.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the Justice Department said that Nashiri, who is
close to Bin Laden, is not in its custody but that the matter was
being handled by other federal agencies abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the most top wanted guys. He's on the list," the
Justice official said. "We don't have him in our custody, but he
could be in military custody or in the custody of some foreign
government with our guys getting access to him."</TE>
<TE>   Nashiri is considered the most senior Al Qaeda operative arrested
since the capture of Abu Zubeida, Bin Laden's operations chief, in
Pakistan last March. Top U.S. officials on Thursday described Nashiri
as the terrorist network's chief operative in the Persian Gulf
region.</TE>
<TE>   News of the capture follows a CIA attack earlier this month that
killed six suspected Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen. One of the dead
has been identified as Qaed Sinan Harithi, who was a suspect in the
Cole attack.</TE>
<TE>   Harithi was in the car hit by a missile fired by an unmanned
surveillance plane. He was believed to be chief of Al Qaeda
operations in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence considers the Saudi-born Nashiri to be the
brains behind the attack on the Cole off Yemen, when two suicide
bombers detonated an explosive against the ship's hull and killed 17
U.S. sailors. He also is believed to have had a hand in the U.S.
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which claimed 224 lives.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Nashiri also planned the failed plot to bomb the
The Sullivans -- another U.S. destroyer docked in Yemen -- nine
months before the Cole attack. Nashiri, reportedly an expert in
explosives and weapons training, has been involved in plotting other
attacks against American military targets in the Gulf region and
"possibly elsewhere," sources added.</TE>
<TE>   A law enforcement "watch list," distributed to police agencies
around the U.S. in the wake of the attacks on New York and the
Pentagon, identifies him as a "known Al Qaeda operative."</TE>
<TE>   The watch list said he attended an Al Qaeda training camp in
Afghanistan in 1997, after meeting Al Qaeda operatives four years
earlier in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   Nashiri, the watch list also states, gave false Yemeni
identification documents to one of the embassy bombers and
"instructed him to [go to] Pakistan where he was to receive further
instruction." It adds that he is a cousin of Jihad Ali, another
suicide bomber "who carried out the attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya."</TE>
<TE>   If reports Nashiri is cooperating with interrogators are true, he
would join Bin Laden deputy Zubeida in providing information.
Officials have said Zubeida helped lead them to Jose Padilla, a U.S.
citizen picked up in Chicago for allegedly planning to reconnoiter
targets for a radioactive "dirty bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Nashiri "has a lengthy track record in terrorism and long-term
ties to other senior Al Qaeda leaders," said a senior U.S. official
who requested anonymity. "He is a ruthless operator."</TE>
<TE>   Before his capture, he was widely considered to be one of Bin
Laden's top operatives still at large, and he enjoyed a "close
relationship" with the terror mastermind, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Nashiri was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest site in Islam
and the place to which all Muslims are supposed to make a pilgrimage
at least once. But U.S. officials said he spent a great deal of his
time in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, who had Saudi citizenship until it was revoked in the
mid-1990s, was of Yemeni heritage. And Yemen has been a key base of
operations for Al Qaeda before and after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy has a track record," said one defense official at the
Pentagon. "... What he knows would be all current terrorist plans in
that part of the world. He would know how the money moves in, how the
money moves out. He's going to know the operators who are going to
carry out the attacks. He's going to know the location of safe houses
throughout the region, and he's going to know how explosives get in
and where they come from.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have a lot of knowledge. And who knows, maybe he
knows where Osama bin Laden is."</TE>

<HD>Billionaire Davis Wants to Be in the Picture at Universal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier and Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire Marvin Davis says he is not just kicking the tires.</LD>
<LD>   Only hours after Paris-based Vivendi Universal said it rebuffed
his initial $13-billion offer, the onetime owner of 20th Century Fox
Film Corp. said he was determined to pursue Universal's entertainment
empire, including its studios, theme parks and recording company.</LD>
<LD>   Davis on Thursday was clearly relishing the limelight, even though
some privately questioned whether he was seriously interested in the
Vivendi properties or just doing what has become his M.O. of sorts --
sniffing around potential ventures, stirring up headlines and then
abruptly walking away.</LD>
<TE>   At Spago in Beverly Hills, Davis sat at his regular table in his
custom-made oversize armchair, lunching on gazpacho with former
Universal Pictures co-Chairman Brian Mulligan, the man considered the
architect behind the takeover proposal. As Davis coyly dodged
questions about his plans for Vivendi--"I'll let you know" -- one
fellow diner and well-wisher was former President Bill Clinton, who
circled back through the eatery for a handshake and chitchat at
Davis' table.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his associates dismissed those who are dismissing him as
a non-player, saying that the $13-billion deal he pitched for a
majority stake in the entertainment assets was a negotiator's
starting point. The 77-year-old oilman-turned-deal-maker called it a
"full and fair" offer and said he planned to meet with Vivendi
executives in January to begin more earnest discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "Marvin's a great entrepreneur. He simply wants to be a mogul
again," said Viacom Inc. Chairman Sumner Redstone, who considers
Davis a close friend. Redstone said he believed Davis' bid for
Universal was serious.</TE>
<TE>   "But his desire for action will not lead him to do something
that's not economically sound," Redstone said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's U.S.-traded shares jumped $2.28, or 20%, to close at $14
on the New York Stock Exchange as investors were encouraged by Davis'
show of interest, which analysts said could attract other potential
suitors.</TE>
<TE>   The offer, said Christopher Dixon, media analyst at UBS Warburg,
"underscores the extraordinary value of Universal's portfolio of
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   It all complicates Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou's carefully
calibrated plans to restructure Vivendi's U.S. entertainment assets.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Vivendi announced that Fourtou would help current
entertainment chief Barry Diller oversee a reorganized Universal
group. If Vivendi formally rejects Davis' bid, sources said, Fourtou
would face greater pressure to expedite plans to spin off the
entertainment assets and take them public.</TE>
<TE>   Those in Davis' camp said it was in Vivendi's interest to deal
now, rather than wait months for the rewards of an initial public
offering. A deal now could infuse billions of dollars in the company
as it tries to dig out from its massive debt.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal caused some to question whether there was a personal
agenda behind it. "Rivals" might be the nicest way to describe the
relationship between Davis and Diller. The two clashed after Davis
hired Diller at Fox in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Diller now divides his time between running Vivendi's U.S.
entertainment assets and his main job as head of USA Interactive
Inc., a sprawling e-commerce business that includes Ticketmaster and
online travel service Expedia Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In making his pitch, Davis has noted that many investors question
whether Diller can handle the responsibilities of both jobs. He has
contended that the company deserves a full-time executive focused
exclusively on Vivendi, a source close to Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the opening he saw," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Observers noted that Davis' statement made no mention of Diller
and said that under his proposal Mulligan would play a "leading role
at the company."</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain, though, whether Diller could stand in the way of
Davis' bid.</TE>
<TE>   Diller has considerable leverage in the future of the
entertainment assets because of a host of restrictions he negotiated
when he sold USA's film and television properties to Vivendi this
year. For example, Vivendi could be forced to pay Diller's USA
Interactive as much as $2 billion in tax liabilities should certain
assets be sold.</TE>
<TE>   But the source close to Davis is not convinced that the contract
is airtight.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is very good at presenting the picture he'd like to
present," he said, adding: "He'll get what's coming to him."</TE>
<TE>   New details of the proposed deal emerged Thursday as the
beleaguered French media giant confirmed that its management had met
with representatives of the Davis group this month to discuss the
proposal but had told the representatives that a sale of Vivendi's
entertainment assets "was not on the agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Although they did not elaborate, company sources said Vivendi
management believed the offer was well below what the businesses are
worth. Davis values the overall group at about $20 billion and has
offered $13 billion to buy about a 65% stake in the assets. That
offer consists of $7 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and $2
billion in preferred stock, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, however, believes the group is worth closer to $35
billion, and some industry analysts place it at $26 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Price isn't the only sticking point. Vivendi's new management team
is not eager to relinquish control of the U.S. entertainment
businesses, even as other parts of the struggling media empire are
being auctioned off to pare $19 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   The offer comes as Fourtou has been working assiduously to restore
investor confidence in Vivendi, which nearly collapsed last summer
and faces criminal probes in the United States and France on
allegations that the company under then-CEO Jean-Marie Messier misled
investors about its financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Messier spent billions trying to transform a water utility into a
rival to AOL Time Warner through a series of media deals, including
the 2000 acquisition of Seagram Co. and its Universal properties.</TE>
<TE>   The unsolicited bid puts pressure on Fourtou and Diller to present
an alternative plan to shareholders. Both men are said to be
preparing a spinoff.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company that is still evolving in terms of strategy,"
said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
"They are still thinking all this through, and so they're not
inclined to do anything right away until they figure out what they
are going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Davis say he believes he can buy the assets at a
relatively good price, cut costs, stabilize management and take the
company public in about three years.</TE>
<TE>   Some executives also doubt the seriousness of the offer given
Davis' reputation as a corporate "tire kicker" whose list of failed
acquisition targets includes CBS, United Airlines and Northwest
Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But sources close to Davis say he is serious and boasts a
consortium of buyers. Deutsche Bank is helping finance the deal, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe our proposal provides full and fair value for the
assets and VU's response has been positive," Davis said in his
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Davis earned his billions in part by leveraging a string of savvy
oil and real estate deals in Denver into a glamorous Hollywood
lifestyle that once included owning the 20th Century Fox studio --
and then selling it for a $350-million profit.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1986 dinner, Davis said of the entertainment business: "I
love this stuff, the people and the glamour. This isn't just a
business. It's a lot of fun."</TE>

<HD>State Budget Crisis Spurs Call for a Special Session</HD>
<DH>Gov. Davis wants the Legislature to start weighing cuts. He
freezes much of state spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones and Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday he will call a special session of the
Legislature on Dec. 9 to consider $5 billion in spending cuts and
other emergency steps to "staunch the bleeding" in the state's shaky
finances.</LD>
<LD>   Davis warned that the 2003-04 budget shortfall will soar beyond
the staggering $21.1 billion projected earlier this month by the
nonpartisan legislative analyst's office, and he said he is imposing
a freeze on much state spending. He refused to discuss any specific
cuts or tax increases he is considering but said he would not ask
legislators to raise taxes in December.</LD>
<LD>   "This problem is so big that it behooves all of us to set aside
our ideological preconceptions and find a way to come together in a
bipartisan fashion to address this shortfall," said Davis, speaking
to reporters by telephone from Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The moves foretell the bitter budget conflicts that await
California's elected leadership in 2003. Democrats and Republicans
are bracing for a brutal budget year, partly because of decisions
that put off hard choices until after the Nov. 5 election and partly
because the state's economy continues to stumble.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision to call the Legislature back to Sacramento will
give the Assembly and Senate an early start on the budget talks and
allow bills passed as part of the special session to take effect more
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Although unusual, such sessions are not unheard of: The
Legislature, for instance, met in special session in 2001 to grapple
with the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis laid out his proposals Thursday afternoon in a 20-minute
phone conversation with Democratic and Republican leaders of the
state Senate and Assembly. It was the first "Big 5" meeting the
governor has convened since Nov. 14, 2001, at the onset of a similar
fiscal crisis last year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis must submit a balanced budget to the Legislature by Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the obvious fiscal challenge, he must also repair his
strained relations with legislators in both parties while bridging
vast philosophical differences between majority Democrats and
minority Republicans. Although Democrats command majorities of both
houses of the Legislature, Republicans still hold enough seats to
block passage of the budget -- which requires two-thirds approval --
if they hold together as a bloc.</TE>
<TE>   The partisan differences were underscored in comments by
legislative leaders after their conversation with the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said they would not
support higher taxes -- a position that some Democrats say is
indefensible in the state's current predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be very resistant to punishing the taxpayers because
this state has overspent," Brulte told reporters later.</TE>
<TE>   He and Cox said they were eager to examine any cuts proposed by
Davis. But they again refused to provide details of how they would
fill the budget hole without raising taxes -- a position that
infuriates Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "My theory is, if they think they can do this all with cuts, then
put their proposal forward and we'll have hearings around the state
and see if the people go for it," said Senate Leader John Burton, who
has vowed to spare low-income Californians from shouldering the brunt
of the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "To do this solely with cuts is just impossible," said Assembly
Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City).</TE>
<TE>   In a graphic reflection of how the state's economy is dragging
down the budget, Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill projected earlier
this month that general fund tax collections in 2002-03 will fall
$4.1 billion short of projections and $6.5 billion short of
projections in 2003-04, largely because of lower personal income tax
receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson applauded Davis for "beginning the process early" and for
pledging to convene regular meetings with the legislative leadership.
Davis' lack of such communication was a chronic source of tension
during his first term.</TE>
<TE>   In the fight over the 2002-03 budget earlier this year, faced with
a shortfall that eventually ballooned to $24 billion and a looming
election, Davis largely bypassed Republican legislators -- much to
the lingering fury of GOP lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Since the projections of another huge budget deficit were made
public earlier this month, Republicans have chided Davis and
legislative Democrats for failing to cut spending earlier.</TE>
<TE>   With state tax collections down sharply because of the weak
economy, both sides agree there will be no way to avoid severe budget
cuts in the current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The state Finance Department is working with senior Davis advisors
to craft a budget, after having asked state departments and agencies
to show how they would cut their budgets by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the full extent of the crisis won't be known until
mid-December, but the consensus of his Finance Department and other
experts is that "the $21-billion deficit is going to be low."</TE>
<TE>   The special legislative session would enable the state "get on top
of this problem as soon as possible," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would exercise his executive authority to "freeze as
much state spending as possible" before giving legislative leaders a
list of proposed cuts and other savings measures during the first
week of December.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the package would not include tax or fee increases.</TE>
<TE>   He also declined to say whether he would encourage the Legislature
to amend the 2002-03 budget to pull back $1.9 billion in education
spending under Proposition 98, a state initiative that mandates a
certain level of education funding.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative Analyst Hill said the Proposition 98 requirement was
inadvertently over-funded by $1.9 billion in the current budget.</TE>
<TE>   Asked specifically if schools would be exempted from cuts, Davis
replied: "I'm not ruling anything in. I'm not ruling anything out.
Education is my highest priority and remains so, but we clearly have
to deal with this long-term budget problem."</TE>
<TE>   However, Davis denied that the state will have trouble paying its
bills when the current fiscal year ends in June.</TE>
<TE>   He said his administration will be "taking action periodically
throughout the current year to achieve even more savings. We just
want to get started earlier than last year, be more aggressive than
last year.... "</TE>
<TE>   The distrust between Republicans and Democrats bubbled to the
surface in the hours before the conference call took place.
Republican leaders were miffed that Davis scheduled a media
teleconference following their discussion, which they considered to
be a private exchange of ideas. The Republicans responded by
scheduling their own teleconference with reporters, 30 minutes after
the governor's scheduled news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans contend that the problem is the result of too much
state spending and should be addressed by cutting programs. Democrats
blame the huge shortfall on the shaky national economy and say the
solution should be a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Budget-cutting options are limited by federal spending mandates,
voter-approved initiatives such as Proposition 98 and constitutional
requirements, which involve roughly two-thirds of general fund
spending.</TE>
<TE>   In releasing her budget projections earlier this month, Hill urged
lawmakers to "put everything on the table ... all programs [and]
revenue sources," including tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Many legislators of both parties say it is a foregone conclusion
that the Legislature is going to restore vehicle license fees to 1998
levels, which could raise about $3.8 billion a year. Democrats also
support an increase in upper-end personal income tax brackets.</TE>

<HD>Indian Casinos on a Roll</HD>
<DH>The number and quality of the California establishments are
up markedly, and they're poised to give Nevada a run for its money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>Cinder-block shacks, bad lighting and bottom-shelf
booze. Lounge lizards with long ashes clinging to the tips of their
cigarettes, placing nickel-and-dime bets on one-armed bandits and
one-eyed jacks.</LD>
<LD>   Not all that long ago, that was the image Native American casinos
had in the eyes of the heavy rollers in Nevada. The notion that "rez
gambling" would ever offer real competition to the neon palaces of
Nevada was tossed aside with a contemptuous chuckle, like a short
stack of $1 chips.</LD>
<LD>   But the shacks are becoming sophisticated resorts. The lounge
lizards, according to California casinos' internal surveys, have
become wealthy gamblers from Beverly Hills and Orange County. And
that short stack of chips has turned into a steady stream of profit.</LD>
<TE>   So last month, when gaming and entertainment giant MGM Mirage
announced a deal to design a $95-million Native American casino in
downtown Palm Springs, the partnership, far from setting the gambling
world abuzz, was greeted with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a sign of indifference -- far from it. Instead, it was
an indication that, two years after California voters guaranteed
Native Americans the exclusive right to operate Vegas-style casinos,
the gambling halls are coming of age and now pose a significant
challenge to Nevada's business.</TE>
<TE>   When voters approved Proposition 1A in 2000, analysts understood
that the number of casinos in California would rise rapidly -- and it
has, from 38 to 50. What they didn't fully appreciate is that the
quality of casinos would rise just as quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Before passage of the measure, Native American casinos operated in
a legal never-never land. More often than not, they were confined to
spartan structures whose only allure was betting.</TE>
<TE>   "Tribes didn't know if they were going to be open from day to
day," said Michael Lombardi, a tribal gaming consultant and former
general manager of the Chumash Casino in the Santa Ynez Valley and
Casino Morongo near Banning. Proposition 1A's assurance of legality
brought California's Native American bands a new economic viability.</TE>
<TE>   Today lenders, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, are
opening their vaults for unprecedented financing of new resorts,
analysts say. Gambling bigwigs such as Donald Trump and Harrah's
Entertainment Inc. are on an if-you-can't-beat 'em spending jag,
forming a series of partnerships with Native Americans to build
casinos.</TE>
<TE>   And, in another sign of Native American economic might, some bands
are insisting that they can and should develop casinos on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The result: huge, glitzy casinos that offer upscale dining,
shopping and entertainment as well as gambling. They may never
approach the excessive splendor of Las Vegas, but they promise an
"experience," not just a gambling excursion.</TE>
<TE>   Californians, who account for 35% of Nevada's gaming revenues, now
have a viable gambling alternative at home. California casino
operators' winnings have ballooned from $1.4 billion to more than
$4.3 billion since the passage of Proposition 1A, surpassing New
Jersey and making the state second only to Nevada's $9.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on both sides of the state line say California casinos
are beginning to eat into Nevada's take, particularly in the Reno
area, which some have predicted will lose a fifth of its revenues to
California.</TE>
<TE>   Nita Helmick, a Riverside County retiree relaxing recently in a
Palm Springs casino lounge, was pleased to report the tidy $54 she
had just won at the slot machines. But she said her favorite local
casino attractions these days are the Vegas-style shows, including
one that featured Elvis impersonators.</TE>
<TE>   And when you get right down to it, some would say, if you can see
Elvis impersonators in California, why go anywhere else?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't drive all the way to Las Vegas again," she said. "Why
would you?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the big Palm Springs deal, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla
Indians has enlisted MGM Mirage executive Ken Rosevear to assist in
the design and construction of a $95-million downtown casino.</TE>
<TE>   The Agua Caliente, a band of 388 members, already operate two
casinos in the area. One of them, the Spa Resort Casino -- much of
which currently operates under a semi-permanent tent -- will be
replaced by November 2003 with an upscale 119,000-square-foot,
three-restaurant casino that could eventually contain 50 table games
and 1,400 slot machines.</TE>
<TE>   The design, said Richard M. Milanovich, chairman of the Agua
Caliente Tribal Council, is "understated and elegant." And it's just
the first phase, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The band plans to expand the new Spa Casino within five years into
a $400-million complex stretching across several blocks of downtown
Palm Springs. With the publicly owned Palm Springs Convention Center
within walking distance and scores of golf courses nearby, the Agua
Caliente want to build a one-stop getaway.</TE>
<TE>   The Agua Calientes' pact with MGM Mirage follows similar deals
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians near
Coachella signed a deal with Trump to turn its Spotlight 29 casino
into a $60-million resort -- with a new name, the Trump 29.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Harrah's helped open the $125-million Harrah's Rincon
Casino &amp; Resort north of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   As for the new MGM Mirage-backed Spa Resort Casino in Palm
Springs, "This place is going to outshine places in Las Vegas," said
General Manager Dominic A. Tegano, who spent 25 years in Nevada's
gambling center. "Why would you want to drive four hours when there's
no traffic -- or six hours when there is traffic -- if you can come
here?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tegano's pledge to outdo Vegas is, of course, unabashed
boosterism. And, as one blackjack dealer muttered recently while
doling out cards at a table in a Riverside County casino: "Vegas will
always be Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   "There is something to be said about location and convenience. But
no one casino is going to be able to compete with the energy that is
Las Vegas," said Rob Stillwell, a vice president of Las Vegas-based
Boyd Gaming Corp., which operates 12 casinos. "At the end of the day,
the customer has choices. And when the customer has choices, it isn't
always going to be proximity that drives that decision."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a Bear Stearns analyst has concluded that the Nevada cities
of Reno and Laughlin will see their gambling revenues decline by
21.6% and 15.4%, respectively, by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas, the report estimates, will see its revenues slide 3.6%.
Though the city's famed Strip will remain relatively insulated --
largely because many of its visitors fly in from other states --
downtown casinos could suffer a 23.4% loss in gaming revenues, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   That assessment, however, was published in February 2000 -- before
gambling bigwigs began partnering with Native American bands to build
casinos in California, and before many analysts understood that
Proposition 1A would open so many financing opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts now believe the impact on Nevada could be even
greater. California casinos could fetch as much as $10 billion in
revenues by the end of the decade, said Bill Eadington, a professor
of economics at the University of Nevada, Reno and director of the
Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming.</TE>
<TE>   The growth of California casinos "could be a disaster" to northern
Nevada, for example, where as much as 50% of the market could be
eliminated soon, Eadington said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Stearns analyst John Mulkey said that, in individual
terms, the Californian who makes four gambling pilgrimages to Nevada each
year might make three instead, a significant shift in the market.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the facilities, in themselves, will replace Las Vegas,"
Mulkey said. "But overall, it's a better product now. And it's going
to have an impact."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no casino in California embodies the new economic
viability of Native American casinos more than the Pechanga Resort &amp;
Casino outside Temecula, a $262-million compound that opened this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Near the site of its humble origins, where it took up eight
trailers, the adobe-style architecture evokes a California-Native
American theme. But inside, the place reeks of Las Vegas -- from its
seven restaurants to the incessant ding-ding-ding of the high-tech
slot machines to the $4 fee required to draw cash from the automated
teller machines.</TE>
<TE>   It is a far cry from the $1.6-billion Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino in
Las Vegas. But it's getting closer.</TE>
<TE>   "It raises the bar. [Native Americans] want to step up to the big
leagues. We're reaching a point of critical mass," said Lombardi, the
tribal gaming consultant.</TE>
<TE>   One recent evening, co-workers and friends Dennis Morgan, 33,
of San Diego and Jerry Garcia, 34, of Murietta were laying down green
$25 chips at a blackjack table at the Pechanga casino. The
conversation was typical blackjack banter -- sarcastic, amusing,
revolving around cards, booze and luck.</TE>
<TE>   But it quickly turned to the player's surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time they moved you guys out of that shed," Garcia
told the dealer. "I mean, it was a shed. It was bad. It was made of
trailer siding."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he will still drive to Vegas -- occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   "I like going to Las Vegas just to get out of Dodge," he said.
"But this place is real nice. This is a local buzz where I can come
during the week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pechanga casino was financed largely through a $150-million
bank loan -- without the help of a corporate gambling giant such as
Harrah's or MGM. That, many analysts believe, is the beginning of a
trend, as fiercely proud and independent Native American tribes forgo
the assistance of Nevada players and strike out on their own.</TE>
<TE>   In Palm Springs, where construction of the Spa Resort Casino is
about to begin, a brouhaha broke out in September after Agua Caliente
tribal officials accused MGM Mirage of overstating its role in the
development.</TE>
<TE>   Now tribal officials point out that they hired an outside gaming
consultant to assist in design and construction -- before the
consultant became an MGM executive. Merely to avoid a conflict of
interest, the consultant essentially placed the contract under the
auspices of MGM's corporate offices, tribal officials say. The
contract will end as soon as the new casino opens, said Tegano, the
general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they are out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   People who have negotiated contracts between Native American bands
and gaming corporations say typical contracts require Native American
bands to give up as much 35% of their revenue -- something tribal
members are no longer willing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a proud sense of who we are," said Milanovich, the Agua
Caliente Tribal Council chairman. "And we want to do this on our
own."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Reno, the dire predictions about losses of gambling revenues
are forcing the city to refurbish its image.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe a series of sizable Native American casinos in the
Sacramento area could be devastating to "The Biggest Little City in
the World." Most experts estimate Reno will eventually lose 75% of
business generated by automobile trips.</TE>
<TE>   If enough casinos are built near Sacramento, they believe, it
could even overcome what many call a key drawback of Native American
casinos: that they are too far apart for gamblers to hop from casino
to casino.</TE>
<TE>   A similar cluster could develop in the Coachella Valley, including
the Agua Calientes' two casinos in the Palm Springs area.</TE>
<TE>   Already, says Lombardi, the tribal consultant, "I can drive in 22
minutes from [Casino] Morongo [near Banning] to the Agua Caliente
Casino. That's if I observe the speed limit -- and nobody does."</TE>
<TE>   Reno is trying fiercely to reinvent itself -- through promotional
tie-ins with nearby ski resorts, by renovating its timeworn downtown
area along the Truckee River, doubling the size of its convention
center, even pitching itself as something of an artists' colony.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, it's going to impact us," said Reno City Manager Charles
McNeely. "We won't do this at the expense of gaming. But we have so
much more to offer this community."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Ryan, the city's redevelopment manager, said gambling is still
the "biggest piece of the economy. But ... we are trying to broaden
and diversify. Hopefully, we will make it worth people's while to
drive over the hill."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NO. 7 USC (8-2)</LD>
<LD>   at NO. 25 UCLA (7-3)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: USC by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: This has some of the markings of one of those rivalry
upset games. But one Trojan quality that seems to have disappeared
under Coach Pete Carroll is haughty overconfidence.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: This was the most humiliating defeat for the Bruins
last season, a 27-0 loss by a team that packed its bags early. Don't
expect another such performance from the new, younger version. But
just how UCLA's freshman quarterbacks will handle the overwhelming
atmosphere remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Forget the bowl implications -- It's USC-UCLA, and
that's plenty.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. Too much experience, too much balance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 12 MICHIGAN (9-2)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 2 OHIO STATE (12-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Ohio State by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan update: No need for the Wolverines to spend too much time
hoping for Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett to sit out because
of his nagging shoulder injury. "I'm too smart to expect that he
won't [play]," Coach Lloyd Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State update: After close calls against Purdue and Illinois,
it's hard to see the Buckeyes as one of the two best teams in the
country. Whether Michigan's mastery over Ohio State in big games can
continue is another question.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: All Ohio State has to do to play for the national
championship is beat Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Ohio State. On the theory the Buckeyes have already
dodged their bullets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON (6-5)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 3 WASHINGTON STATE (9-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Washington State by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Washington update: The inclination to write off the Huskies
evaporated last week with their 42-14 victory over Oregon. Washington
is the underdog in the Apple Cup again, but last season the Huskies
upset No. 9 Washington State, 26-14.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: It's simple: Win Saturday, and Washington
State clinches a Rose Bowl berth with an outside shot at Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Washington State, which went 67 years between Rose
Bowl appearances, can clinch its second in five years with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Washington State. But even if the Cougars lose, they can
clinch a trip to the Rose Bowl by beating UCLA on Dec. 7 in the final
game of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 24 TEXAS TECH (8-4)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 4 OKLAHOMA (9-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Oklahoma by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech update: Kliff Kingsbury threw for an astounding 473
yards and six touchdowns in Texas Tech's 42-38 upset of Texas last
week. One more upset would give the Red Raiders the Big 12 South
title after sneaking into the race.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: One thing to consider about Kingsbury against the
Sooner defense: Oklahoma held him to a season-low 234 yards passing
in a 30-13 victory last season.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Crystal clear: The winner goes to the Big 12 title
game against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma. The Sooner defense, ranked fourth in the
nation, should be enough to do a number on Kingsbury again and send
Oklahoma to the Big 12 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AUBURN (7-4)</TE>
<TE>   at NO. 9 ALABAMA (9-2)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Alabama by 10 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn update: Auburn lost last year's Iron Bowl, 31-7, and trails
the series against Alabama, 38-27-1. The Tigers will be going against
the national leaders in defense, with Alabama giving up only 244.3
yards a game, 84.1 on the ground. Auburn has rushed for at least 100
yards every game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama update: The Crimson Tide clinched the best record in the
SEC West, but Alabama isn't eligible for the SEC title game or a bowl
game because of NCAA probation.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: With probation in effect, there's nothing left for
Alabama to do this season but beat Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Alabama. This is the Crimson Tide's bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 14 FLORIDA STATE (8-3)</TE>
<TE>   at N.C. STATE (9-3)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Florida State by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State update: The Seminoles, written off early and later
revived, can clinch the ACC title and an automatic spot in one of the
BCS bowl games with a victory over N.C. State or a Maryland loss.</TE>
<TE>   N.C. State update: The Wolfpack is reeling with three consecutive
losses after a 9-0 start. With 46 passing yards, quarterback Philip
Rivers will become the third quarterback in ACC history to throw for
3,000 yards twice.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Florida State, surprisingly, is one step from taking
its place at a BCS bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Florida State. After three losses in a row, N.C. State
looks cooked.</TE>

<LD>Florida freshman Matt Walsh found new ways to shine Thursday night in
a 99-65 victory over Eastern Illinois in the Preseason NIT at
Gainesville, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh had 20 points, nine assists, six rebounds and five steals to
lift the eighth-ranked Gators (2-0) to an easy victory, helping them
earn a trip to New York to face Stanford on Wednesday in the NIT
semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Billy Donovan got contributions from other freshmen. Anthony
Roberson also scored 20 points, and Rashid Al-Kaleem went three for
seven from three-point range and finished with 11 points.</LD>
<TE>   Florida senior Justin Hamilton helped shut down Henry Domercant of
Eastern Illinois (1-1). Domercant averaged 26 points last season and
scored 36 in the opener Monday against Boise State, but finished with
only seven points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky forward Erik Daniels was suspended for four games because
he played in two summer basketball leagues. NCAA rules allow players
to participate in one sanctioned league per summer. The 6-foot-8
junior won't play in next week's Maui Invitational or Kentucky's home
opener against High Point on Dec. 3.</TE>

<LD>BUFFALO AT NEW YORK JETS</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: New York by 3</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Meet the new Drew.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In the AFC East, it's all about the quarterbacks. A kid
named Tom Brady wins the Super Bowl for New England, so the Patriots
trade Drew Bledsoe to Buffalo, a move that instantly transforms the
Bills into playoff contenders, forcing the Jets to keep up -- or at
least roll the dice with Chad Pennington. Barring injury to
Pennington, it's safe to say the Vinny Testaverde era is over. In six
starts, Pennington is 4-2, completing 75.3% of his passes for a 107.5
quarterback rating. Each year, three AFC quarterbacks are named to
the Pro Bowl. Two of them could be playing at the Meadowlands on
Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   DETROIT AT CHICAGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Chicago by 5 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: In the Black and Blue Division, this is what the
other guys look like.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Soldier Field isn't the only thing that has been torn down
in Chicago this season. The Bears, playing every game on the road,
have spread the dejection -- going 1-4 at their "home" field in
Champaign, Ill., and 1-4 everywhere else. The Lions are 3-7, a great
leap forward in Detroit. Rookie Joey Harrington is last in the NFC
with a 61.2 quarterback rating, but with his next touchdown pass he
ties the club rookie record, 11, shared by Charlie Batch, Jeff Komlo
and Fred Enke. When the Bears look at Chris Chandler and Jim Miller,
they look to next year's draft.</TE>

<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Three cheers, St. Louis, for Warner's return. How
about two? One?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Kurt Warner, one-time Super Bowl hero and two-time NFL MVP,
returns to the Ram starting lineup this weekend, causing hearts to
sink all over St. Louis. Did you see those beautiful spirals Marc
Bulger reeled off during his 5-0 long-relief stint? Did you see those
nervous wobblers Warner threw during the one series he played Monday
night? With no margin for error as his team heads into its stretch
drive, Ram Coach Mike Martz is turning the season over to Warner.
Coaching isn't easy in this league. As Washington's Steve Spurrier is
beginning to discover.</TE>

<TE>   SAN DIEGO AT MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: A couple of runs at history.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Is it any surprise that neither the Dolphins nor the
Chargers have had a player lead the NFL in rushing? Too many
big-armed quarterbacks -- Dan Marino, Dan Fouts, John Hadl. Too many
good backs in Miami at the same time -- Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick,
Mercury Morris -- and then none for years. Come 2002, San Diego's
LaDainian Tomlinson (1,053 yards) and Miami's Ricky Williams (913)
are making a run at it, and Sunday they take their old Texas
Christian-Texas rivalry to a new level. Subplot: Ex-Charger assistant
Norv Turner tackles his greatest challenge: wringing another win out
of Ray Lucas.</TE>

<TE>   ATLANTA AT CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: It must be the black cats on their helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: From the people who brought you Rae Carruth, the Panthers
continue to spread joy and civic pride around Charlotte. In the last
17 days, Panther defensive linemen Julius Peppers and Brentson
Buckner have tested positive for banned substances, offensive tackle
Chris Terry failed to show up in court on domestic violence charges
and wide receiver Steve Smith punched out teammate Anthony Bright so
badly, Bright spent two nights in a hospital. Terry has since been
cut, Smith and Buckner suspended with Peppers soon to join them.
Sounds like a 3-7 team headed straight for 3-13.</TE>

New Orleans"</TE>

<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Kids these days ...</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In Dallas, Troy Hambrick is the future, Emmitt Smith is the
past, but what about the present? That's been a bit of a problem,
with Smith hanging on to break the all-time rushing record and
Hambrick champing harder at the bit now that Emmitt's got his. "I
just feel like it comes a time," Hambrick said last week. "It's not
my call to say when it's time, but I'm a guy that wants to get my
career off the ground and establish myself as a household name."
Whatever happened to respecting your elders? For Cowboy Coach Dave
Campo, that's a question to ponder as he makes his way out of town.</TE>

<TE>   CINCINNATI AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 11</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Kordell Stewart eases back against the Bengals.
Uh-oh.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Stewart gets his latest, and probably last, chance at
quarterback for the Steelers while Tommy Maddox recovers from the
concussion and bruised spinal cord he suffered in Sunday's loss to
Tennessee. On paper, this is the perfect setting for Stewart to get
reacclimated: a home game against the Bengals. Unless the paper
you're holding is the stat sheet from Stewart's last game against the
Bengals. Stewart was intercepted four times in a 26-23 overtime loss
at Cincinnati last December. It shouldn't happen again, but with
Stewart, you and all of Pittsburgh can never be too sure.</TE>

<TE>   MINNESOTA AT NEW ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 7 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Now or never for New England.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If it's going to take 10 wins to return to the playoffs, the
defending Super Bowl champions will have to finish their
regular-season schedule 5-1. With that schedule backloaded -- the
Patriots close against the Titans, the Jets and the Dolphins -- New
England needs to take advantage of a three-game run against three of
the flimsiest defenses in the league, the Vikings, the Lions and the
Bills. Despite their 32nd-ranked defense and quarterback issues, the
Vikings are 3-3 in their last six games. Minnesota leads the NFL in
penalties, 91, not counting those accrued when Randy Moss is behind
the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "For Patriots, Playoff Drive Begins Here"</TE>

<TE>   CLEVELAND AT NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Big home stand for Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Having lost two of their last three games, including a sweep
by division rival Atlanta, the Saints return home for two games that
very well could decide their season -- Cleveland on Sunday and Tampa
Bay on Dec. 1. Cleveland, 5-5, remains in playoff contention by luck
of the draw (the Browns belong to the so-soft AFC North) and a late
goal-line stand in last week's 27-20 victory over Cincinnati. That a
so-called contender should need a goal-line stand to stave off the
Bengals raises questions about the legitimacy of so-called contender.
One more thing: Browns haven't played on artificial turf since 2000.</TE>

<TE>   TENNESSEE AT BALTIMORE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The Titans, so much to answer for.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Titans couldn't beat the Ravens at home in the 2000
playoffs, allowing the Super Bowl to be pillaged by Brian Billick's
blights, thrusting the NFL into a dark, depressing hole for 12 months
before wonder kid Tom Brady miraculously rode to the rescue. Since
then, the Ravens have been force-fed their just desserts -- the
salary cap succeeded where the Titans had failed earlier. Baltimore
is scuffling along at 4-6, with Ray Lewis in and out of the lineup,
the playoffs looking like a longshot. The Titans have won their last
five and are tied for first in the AFC South. Thankfully, this game
is cyclical.</TE>

<TE>   OAKLAND AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 8</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Remember the Snow Bowl. One more time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Last Sunday, the Raiders may have avenged last season's
controversial playoff defeat in New England, but they may never purge
the memory. Figuring they had struck their final blow against tuck
rules and in-your-face snow angels with their 27-20 victory over the
Patriots, the Raiders were quickly reminded by Coach Bill Callahan
why they had to play that game in New England in January: because
they lost a gimme, at home, to Arizona in December, costing them
home-field advantage. The goal this time is to ensure it doesn't
happen again. Arizona, winless in its last four, will help as much as
it can.</TE>

<TE>   KANSAS CITY AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Turning the thing around: Two case studies.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Through Week 7, these were two of the sorriest defenses in
pro football. The Chiefs were yielding an average of 33 points a
game; the Seahawks were last in defending against the run. Since
then, the Chiefs are 2-1 after holding three potent offenses
(Oakland, San Francisco, Buffalo) to 17 points or fewer. Seattle
still ranks last against the run, having given up 202 rushing yards
in last Sunday's 31-9 home loss to Denver, which explains the 3-7
record. Chief running back Priest Holmes, averaging 101.2 yards a
game, has a better-than-average chance of doubling that figure Sunday
in Seattle.</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK GIANTS AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 5 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jim Fassel knows how to pick his spots.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Giant Coach Fassel became something of a legend in New York
in 2000 for taking his team to the Super Bowl after uttering his
famous "playoff guarantee." A giddy tale, but Fassel's no idiot. He
saw the Giants were closing their schedule against a string of
noncontenders and took a calculated shot. Same deal this season when
he took over the play-calling duties after a 17-3 loss at
Philadelphia. Next four games were against Jacksonville, Minnesota,
Washington and Houston. Guess what? Fassel's 3-0. Amazing! Soon to be
4-0, thank you, Texans! The hard part comes Dec. 1: Giants versus
Titans.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Through Thanksgiving, Anyway, Fassel's a

<TE>   GREEN BAY AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Packers, Buccaneers meet in "NFC final preview."
Uh-oh.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: To the winner of this one goes the No. 1 seeding in the NFC
... for all of seven days, anyway. There's a great league-wide fear
of peaking too early this season, which is why as soon as any team is
tagged as the latest "team to beat," that's what immediately happens.
Green Bay was there last weekend before stepping out onto the
Metrodome carpet against the 2-7 Vikings and watching Brett Favre
throw three interceptions. The Packers and Buccaneers are both 8-2,
with old pals Favre and Warren Sapp doing the old NFC Central tango
again. The Buccaneers are favored. Good luck.</TE>

<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS AT DENVER</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 6 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: How far can Steve Beuerlein go?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: More fun with football stats: Subbing for the injured Brian
Griese last Sunday, Beuerlein threw two passes in the fourth quarter
against Seattle. Both went for touchdowns. At that pace -- two passes
for two touchdowns a quarter -- Beuerlein will break the league's
single-game record for touchdown passes (seven) Sunday and the
single-season record (48) on Dec. 29 as he goes 50 for 50 passing for
50 touchdowns in the greatest 6.25-week performance in history. These
are the kind of mind games Griese can play as he waits for his knee
to heal while wondering if his next start will come before 2003.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: New passer versus new kicker.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Koy Detmer and Jeff Chandler step into the Monday night
spotlight because last Sunday, Donovan McNabb played more than three
quarters on a broken ankle ... or was it Jose Cortez? Cortez (The
Rally Killer) looked the part, badly shanking a 41-yard field goal in
overtime to set up the 49ers' 20-17 loss in San Diego. That was
Cortez' fourth miss in eight tries, so Chandler, a rookie, gets his
chance now. McNabb is out of the rest of regular season, possibly
facing surgery, turning the Eagles' playoff drive over to Detmer.
Plus side: Detmer won his last start. Down side: That was in 1999.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Quentin Richardson will be activated from the injured list today.</LD>
<LD>   Unless he's not.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers wouldn't say for certain Thursday what they would do
with Richardson, their top reserve guard. It's expected that
Richardson will be activated, but will play only a few minutes
tonight against the Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry said the Clippers "probably are going to
activate him" in time to play tonight. Gentry also said, "The
possibility is greater that he will be activated rather than stay on
the injured list."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson sat out six games while recovering from a bruised right
knee and is eager to return, and the Clippers want to make sure he's
sound before turning him loose.</TE>
<TE>   "I still need to get my legs under me," Richardson said after
practicing with his teammates for the first time since going on the
injured list Nov. 12.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach State (0-0) at North Carolina Charlotte (0-0), 4:30 p.m.
PST, KRLH (590) -- Two 49er teams do battle. Charlotte, with six
players back from last year's NCAA tournament team, is the favorite.
Guard Demon Brown averaged 11.3 points and 4.2 assists last season
and guard Curtis Nash averaged 10 points and 3.6 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine (0-0) vs. No. 7 Oklahoma (0-1), Sooner tournament,
Norman, Okla., 5 p.m. PST, KUCI-FM (88.9) -- Will 7-foot center Adam
Parada, a potential NBA prospect, play much? He was yanked from the
starting lineup of last week's exhibition by Irvine Coach Pat
Douglass, who has not been happy with Parada's efforts in practice.
Oklahoma committed 18 turnovers and was outrebounded by Alabama in a
68-62 loss. Princeton and Western Michigan are also in the event.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (0-0) at Bradley (0-0), KPLS (830), 5 p.m. PST --
Pepperdine opens the season with high expectations. The Waves have
four starters and the top five scorers from last season's 22-9 team
that reached the NCAA tournament. Senior forwards Jimmy Miggins and
Boomer Brazzle lead a balanced lineup for second-year Coach Paul
Westphal. Bradley has four starters from a 9-20 team and, like
Pepperdine, favors an up-tempo style. Former Bradley and NBA guard
Jim Les makes his debut as coach.</LD>
<TE>   CS Fullerton (0-0) vs. Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi (0-0), Hawaiian
Tip-Off tournament, Honolulu, 7 p.m. PST -- Fullerton's Pape Sow, a
6-foot-10 center, has been slowed by an ankle injury and his cousin,
6-11 Babacar Camara, has an Achilles' heel problem. Titan forward
Brandon Campbell is out indefinitely because of foot problems. Corpus
Christi has 10 lettermen and three starters returning. Hawaii and
Arkansas-Little Rock round out the field.</TE>
<TE>   CS Northridge (0-0) at Portland State (0-0), 7 p.m., KCSN-FM
(88.5) -- First-year Coach Heath Schrover and the refurbished Stott
Center, which underwent a $1-million renovation, will be formally
introduced tonight by Portland State. Northridge and Portland State
are former Big Sky Conference opponents and each posted 12-16 records
last year. The Matadors split two exhibition games and want to avoid
a start like last season, when they went 1-8.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Chicago (0-0) at Loyola Marymount (0-0), 7 p.m., KXLU-FM
(88.9) -- Former UCLA player and coach Larry Farmer begins his fifth
season as coach of Loyola Chicago, which was 17-13 and nearly reached
the NCAA tournament last season, losing in overtime on a last-second
shot in the Horizon League tournament final. Point guard David
Bailey, a 5-foot-8 senior, averaged 21.2 points and 4.6 assists for
the Ramblers. Loyola Marymount has nine new players, including seven
freshmen. Sophomore forward Andy Osborn is among three returning
starters for the Lions, coming off a 9-20 record.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara (0-0) vs. Weber State (0-0), Top of the World
tournament, Fairbanks, Alaska, 8 p.m. -- Guard Nick Jones begins the
season as a starter for the first time in three seasons for the
banged-up Gauchos. Bray Skultety, a 6-6 senior, is lost to a knee
injury. Guard Branduinn Fullove has a strained left knee and freshman
Josh Davis has been hurting. Guard Jermaine Boyette and Ohio State
transfer Slobodan Ocokoljic, a 6-8 forward, lead Weber State.</TE>

American-driver-of-the-year balloting, CART champion Cristiano da
Matta edged Winston Cup champion Tony Stewart and three other drivers
for this year's annual award.</LD>
<LD>   Da Matta, leaving CART for a Formula One career with Toyota after
tonight's awards banquet in Miami, and Stewart received an equal
number of votes from the 17-member panel, but the Brazilian prevailed
in the tiebreaker. Also receiving votes in the first-place-only
balloting were Steve Kinser of the World of Outlaws and drag racers
Larry Dixon and John Force.</LD>
<LD>   "That's cool, it's great," Da Matta said after being notified of
his selection. "It complements a great year."</LD>
<TE>   Asked if he might return to CART after his Formula One career, Da
Matta diplomatically said, "If I'm still at an age that I can be
competitive running CART, then why not?"</TE>
<TE>   Driving a Toyota-powered Lola for Newman-Haas Racing, the
5-foot-4, 130-pound former karting champion from Belo Horizonte,
Brazil, won seven races, seven poles and had 10 podium finishes in 19
races. His 74-point margin over Bruno Junqueira, his longtime friend
and neighbor from Belo Horizonte, is the second largest in series
history. Junqueira has been named to replace Da Matta on the
Newman-Haas team next year.</TE>
<TE>   After Da Matta and Stewart deadlocked in the vote, panel chairman
Barry Schmoyer invoked a tiebreaker for the first time. On four
quarterly ballots, Da Matta had 246 votes to 66 for Stewart.
Quarterly winners were Indy Racing League champion Sam Hornish Jr.,
Da Matta, Dixon and NASCAR driver Kurt Busch.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta's selection ended a string by Winston Cup champions, who
had won the last five years and seven of the last eight. Only Force,
in 1996, broke the NASCAR monopoly. The last CART driver to win the
award was Nigel Mansell in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The award is given to American drivers in any series in the world
and any foreign driver in an American series. Da Matta is the third
foreign recipient, joining Britain's Mansell and Brazilian Emerson
Fittipaldi, who won in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the fourth Newman-Haas driver to have won the award.
Others were Mansell, Mario Andretti and Michael Andretti.</TE>
<TE>   "It's well deserved and makes the season even better," said Paul
Newman, co-owner of the Havoline-sponsored car driven by the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who will receive $1 million at tonight's CART banquet,
will get a crystal trophy, a custom Indian motorcycle and a Maurice
Lacroix Swiss watch as driver of the year.</TE>

<HD>Fairfax Stands Up to Crenshaw, 13-12</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fairfax stopped running back Dary Adway on a two-point conversion
play in overtime to upset third-seeded Crenshaw, 13-12, on Thursday
afternoon in a City Championship first-round game at Crenshaw.</LD>
<LD>   Fairfax (7-3) took the lead, 13-6, on its first overtime
possession when quarterback Troy Jackson found Barry Johnson for a
nine-yard touchdown pass on third down. Danilo DeLeon, who missed a
26-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, added the extra point.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a slant and I pump-faked," Jackson said. "The defensive
back jumped up and Barry slid outside. It was chemistry. The play
wasn't designed."</LD>
<TE>   Crenshaw (7-3) responded with a seven-yard touchdown pass from
Andrew Simpson to Gardener McKay on its second play. The Cougars
didn't have kicker Kevin Menjivar, who was academically ineligible,
so they went for two points and the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Adway stumbled as he went toward the right side and the Lions'
defense kept him a half-yard shy of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax, seeded No. 14, held a 6-0 lead until Simpson connected
with Daymeion Hughes for a 16-yard touchdown reception with 8:12
left.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions scored on Kareem Dennis' 27-yard touchdown reception
from Jackson with 10 seconds left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Venice 47, Fremont 17 -- Quarterback Eddie Miller has a lot of
weapons at his disposal and he used them all to exploit Fremont's
defense in a City Championship first-round game at Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Miller threw three touchdown passes and ran for another for the
fourth-seeded Gondoliers (9-2), who spread the offensive wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Ellis ran for 109 yards and scored three touchdowns. Gerald
Rodriguez caught six passes for 95 yards, and B.J. Vickers had five
receptions for 61 yards, including a 22-yard scoring pass.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis gave Venice a 7-0 lead with a one-yard touchdown run, but
Fremont (8-3) answered with a 16-play, 70-yard drive. Quarterback
Michael Beach shoveled a one-yard pass to Mark Bradford, who tied the
score.</TE>
<TE>   Venice took the lead again when Miller threw a back screen across
the field to Ellis. The running back followed a four-man caravan and
then split across the field to complete a 43-yard scoring play.</TE>
<TE>   The game turned on Fremont's next possession. Milvon James was
stopped short on fourth down at the Pathfinder 35-yard line. Venice
took advantage when Miller scurried into the end zone for a 12-yard
run and a 21-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey 33, Franklin 22 -- The defending City champions trailed
after three quarters, but used two fourth-quarter touchdowns,
including the go-ahead score on a 76-yard pass from Donald Prince to
Cleveland Morris with 9:42 left to earn a first-round victory at
Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Prince had two touchdown runs to give the ninth-seeded Dons (5-6)
a 12-7 halftime lead after Franklin's Brandon Torres scored on an
87-yard run for the game's first points.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-seeded Panthers (9-2) lost linebacker Brandon Powers
for the second half because of a shoulder injury, and Dorsey
capitalized as Jeremiah Johnson rushed for 158 second-half yards and
scored two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Viola caught seven passes for 126 yards and one touchdown and
Narciso Diaz completed 12 of 25 passes for 179 yards and one
touchdown with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mayar Zokaei</TE>
<TE>   Taft 42, Banning 14 -- Cary Dove completed 17 of 21 passes for a
career-high 389 yards and three touchdowns to lead the top-seeded
Toreadors (11-0) over Banning (4-7) in a City Championship
first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Noah Smith caught five passes for 146 yards and one touchdown, and
Steve Smith caught eight passes for 145 yards and one touchdown. Paul
Pratt added three receptions for 91 yards and one touchdown for the
Toreadors.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Gardena 30, Sylmar 24 -- Quarterback LaFerrell Payne scored two
touchdowns in the final 1:29 for the host Panthers, who won a City
Championship playoff game for the first time since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Payne scored on a 15-yard keeper to give seventh-seeded Gardena
(8-3) a 23-17 lead and he answered a Sylmar touchdown with an 18-yard
keeper with 27 seconds to clinch the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Payne rushed for 153 yards and a third touchdown in 10 carries and
completed three of nine passes for 57 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ryen Carew rushed for 253 yards and two touchdowns in 27 carries
for 10th-seeded Sylmar (8-3).</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro vs. Roosevelt, ppd. -- Principals from both schools
agreed to postpone the game until 7 tonight at a site to be
determined after a power failure left the field in darkness in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The scoreless game will be resumed with 6:39 left in the second
quarter. San Pedro will have the ball facing a fourth-and-14 at the
Roosevelt 42-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Fans in attendance were given a voucher for admittance to
resumption of play tonight. For game site information, call (323)
268-7241 after noon.</TE>

<LD>The Long Beach Poly boys' cross-country team might not be at full
strength for the Southern Section championships Saturday at Mt. San
Antonio College, but the Jackrabbits are still expected to contend
for their fifth Division I title in the last seven years.</LD>
<LD>   Poly could be without senior Kevin Brulois, who had an
appendectomy Nov. 13, for the second consecutive meet. But the
state's top-ranked team has so much depth that it's still regarded as
a contender in a race that includes No. 2 Los Angeles Loyola, No. 3
Dana Point Dana Hills, No. 4 Chino Don Lugo, No. 5 Murrieta Valley,
No. 6 Canyon Country Canyon and No. 7 Simi Valley Royal.</LD>
<LD>   Murrieta Valley, the No. 14-ranked girls' team in the nation by
Harrier magazine, is favored to win its first Division I title. But
the Nighthawks are expected to receive strong challenges from
Thousand Oaks, Canyon Country Canyon and Dana Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Hesperia Sultana, ranked third nationally, is heavily favored to
win its third Division II girls' title in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Riverside Rubidoux is expected to battle Orange
for the Division II boys' championship, and Barstow is heavily
favored to win its second consecutive Division III boys' title.</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park is shooting for its third consecutive Division IV boys'
title, but the Eagles will be slight underdogs to Tri-Valley League
rival Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   The meet starts at 7:45 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Belmont's string of consecutive boys' cross-country
titles could end at seven Saturday when the City Section
championships are held at Pierce College in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Belmont has won 17 of the last 20 varsity boys' titles, but San
Pedro and Sepulveda Monroe are the favorites heading into the meet,
which starts at 8:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro won the second of two qualifying heats in the City
preliminaries Nov. 14, but Coach Bruce Thomson says it would be a
mistake to count out a Belmont program that traditionally produces
its best races in the finals.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe, runner-up in the previous three City championships, will
be led by defending champion and individual favorite Manuel Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro is favored to win its second consecutive girls' title
and third in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa Birmingham, led by leading individual qualifier Marina
Santana, is expected to be San Pedro's toughest challenger.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Mater Dei boys' basketball team, which won the
Southern Section Division II-AA title last year, will play in
Division II-A this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs are one of three defending section champions that
will play in different enrollment-based divisions this season.</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat, which won the Division III-AA title, will
play in Division III-A, and North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, which
won Division IV-AA, will play in Division III-A.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Timi E-Nunu, a 6-foot center for Etiwanda, signed a letter of
intent with New Mexico. E-Nunu, who will play forward in college,

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been a difficult senior year for Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana, who
has been affected by personal tragedy, the stress of picking a
college and the on-course failure of her touted Long Beach Wilson
girls' golf team, but Thursday she shot two-under-par 70 in pristine
conditions at Mission Lakes Country Club in Desert Hot Springs and
won the Southern Section individual championship.</LD>
<LD>   Tangtiphaiboontana hit 11 of 12 fairways, 13 greens in regulation
and sank a 60-foot putt for one of her four birdies. She followed
each of her two bogeys with a birdie.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt pretty good out there," Tangtiphaiboontana said. "I was
hitting the ball good and putting well. I was relaxed."</LD>
<TE>   All the while she kept her mind clear of the disappointment from
Wilson's fifth-place finish in the section team finals Monday that
kept the Bruins, ranked No. 1 by The Times, from advancing to the
CIF-WSCGA finals.</TE>
<TE>   Also free from the pressures of college recruiting, having signed
Nov. 13 with Stanford, Tangtiphaiboontana kept in check emotions from
a personal loss that would send many reeling.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents were killed in a car accident as they drove Jenni and
Wilson teammate Dianne Sirisut home from the section team
championships last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "They were in the back of my mind," Jenni said. "I didn't think
about them specifically, but they are always there."</TE>
<TE>   She did think about trying to stay on top of a field that included
several top-notch underclassmen. Sophomore Jennie Lee of Huntington
Beach Edison and junior Amie Cochran of West Torrance tied at
71.Freshman Angela Park of Torrance was another stroke back at 72.
Sophomore Sommer Scholl of Riverside King was among the three tied at
73.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Riza Zalameda won all but two games while sweeping three sets at
No. 2 singles, and the top two doubles teams also swept for
top-seeded Beverly Hills in a 13-5 victory over Laguna Beach in a
Southern Section Division I girls' tennis semifinal match at Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The doubles victories by Tova Hausman and Anna Litovsky at No. 1
and Stephanie Ellis and Liana Babich at No. 2 helped Beverly Hills
(21-0) win seven of nine sets. A 6-2 victory by Hausman and Litovsky
over Laguna Beach's No. 2 doubles team of Jackie Reed and Britton
Simons made the score 10-3 in the third round and clinched the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Doubles play set the tone early as Ellis and Babich won, 6-4, and
the Normans' third team of Jade Sherman and Vivian Yoon won, 7-6 (3),
in first-round sets to help Beverly Hills to a 5-1 lead. The
fourth-seeded Breakers, making the jump to Division I after winning
the last four Division V titles, never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "That was it," Hausman said of the quick start. "It's a huge
difference in your confidence and momentum."</TE>

<LD>For the first time in well over two years, Euchre will be running in
something other than a graded stakes today at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   A winner of six of 24 starts who has earned more than $888,000,
the 6-year-old Personal Flag gelding drops in class to take on four
other older horses in the second race, a $58,000 allowance at 1 1/16
miles.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Frank Stronach and trained by Bobby Frankel, Euchre has
consistently come up short in stakes at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita,
Del Mar and Prairie Meadows since earning his last win July 7, 2001,
in the Cornhusker Handicap at Prairie Meadows.</LD>
<TE>   The Canadian-bred has lost eight in a row since but could wake up
over a track where he has won three of five. Alex Solis will ride
Euchre, who has been first or second in eight of nine races at 1 1/16
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Three of his opponents are coming off wins and the other was
second by a neck in his most recent outing.</TE>

<HD>George Is Ticketed for Injured List</HD>

<LD>Devean George, who has not played since Nov. 8 because of tendinitis
in his ankle, probably will be put on the injured list when Shaquille
O'Neal comes off, as soon as today.</LD>
<LD>   Team officials have compared George's injury to one Kobe Bryant
suffered two seasons ago, when he sat out all but 11 minutes over 10
games in March and April.</LD>
<LD>   George, whose 11.7-point average is second on the team to Bryant's
29.4, would have to spend a minimum of five games off the active
roster.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soumaila Samake, O'Neal's preseason choice for backup center, is
eligible to play tonight after serving a five-game suspension for
violating the terms of the league's steroid policy.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen, who has yet to play because of a strained hamstring,
is "very close" to coming off the injured list after a good practice
Thursday, according to Coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago center Eddy Curry, on his duty tonight: "It will
definitely be the type of game where you try not to get caught up in
the hype and think, 'This is the real thing right here; this is
Shaq.' All I can do is play. I'm an NBA player. But at times you
think, 'This is Shaq and Kobe.' It's always like that, but this time
it's on a different scale."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker Mike Penberthy visited during Thursday's practice. He
plays professionally in Italy.... Industry insiders expect Bryant to
sign with Nike in February.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Chicago, 7:30, FSN</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 3-9, Bulls 4-8.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bulls (2001-02) -- 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Here's how it went last year: The Lakers went to
Chicago, Brad Miller and Charles Oakley hacked O'Neal into such a
frenzy that O'Neal threw a punch at the back of Miller's head. Though
he missed, he was suspended for three games. The Lakers lost in
overtime, but promised revenge. So, three weeks later, with O'Neal
resting his sore toe at Staples Center and Kobe Bryant scoring 38
points, the Bulls won again. The Bulls have lost four of five games,
most recently Wednesday at Golden State.</TE>

<HD>No Triple Crown, but Yeley Dominates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.J. Yeley didn't sweep the three U.S. Auto Club open-wheel
championships this year, the way Tony Stewart did in 1995, but the
Phoenix driver came about as close as he could.</LD>
<LD>   Yeley won the Silver Crown series for dirt-track-type cars,
finished second 13 points behind Tracy Hines in sprint cars and has
an outside chance of catching Dave Darland in the midget category.
With three races remaining, Darland leads, 1,212 points to 1,126.</LD>
<LD>   Next Thursday night, Yeley, Darland, Hines and defending champion
Dave Steele will be challenged by newly crowned Winston Cup champion
Stewart in the 60th running of the Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix at
Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward -- I'm sure all of us are -- to racing
against Tony," Yeley said during a lull in testing his midget on
Irwindale's half-mile paved oval. "I've raced against him before and
now that he's the Winston Cup champion, it adds a lot more excitement
to the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Before Yeley runs his last race this year, he will have taken the
green flag in 93 events, and that doesn't count the Indy Experience
two-seaters he drove at every Indy Racing League race.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get the funding to race in the IRL, so I did the next
best thing, I drove fans around the track in modified race cars," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He won three Silver Crown, seven sprint car and four midget races,
with three remaining, Saturday night at Tucson, Thanksgiving at
Irwindale and two nights later at Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   After conquering USAC and failing to find a seat with the IRL or
CART, Yeley hopes to follow other open-wheel champions such as Jeff
Gordon, Ryan Newman and Stewart into NASCAR. He has several Busch
Grand National tests pending, one in two weeks with Jason Keller's
PPC Racing team.</TE>
<TE>   "With so many CART drivers and sponsors moving into the IRL, it's
going to squeeze out a lot of low-budget teams, and I know what that
means," Yeley said.</TE>
<TE>   Yeley drove for Sinden Racing Services in the 1998 Indianapolis
500 in what he calls "the most memorable experience" of his career,
only to have the team disband for lack of funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you drive in the world's most famous race, it has to be
memorable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yeley's No. 44 made the evening highlights from Indy when he spun
on the first turn of the first lap, brushing wheels with Eddie
Cheever.</TE>
<TE>   "I started 13th and it was kind of cold and when I went into Turn
1 alongside Cheever, he sort of pinned me down and I got off the
throttle. I had been told not to touch the brakes at that point, so I
coasted until I ran out of race track. We barely touched but I did a
half-spin backwards and had to pit to change the tires.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost a lap in the pits and never got it back. I finished ninth,
but the way the car was running, if I had got my lap back, I would
have been fifth."</TE>
<TE>   Cheever went on to win the race.</TE>
<TE>   Yeley will be in an Ed Pink Ford-powered Beast, owned by Steve
Lewis, a Laguna Beach publisher-promoter. His No. 91 will be part of
a record five-car Lewis entry, which also includes Stewart, Darland,
Kasey Kahne and Bobby East, son of chassis builder Bob East.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a high-dollar team Lewis has, with five guys and renting
the track for practice," Steele said from Indianapolis, where his
team is installing a new Gary Stanton-built Mopar engine in his
midget. Steele drove for Lewis when he won on the track's opening
night in March 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Steele won last year's Turkey Night race in a car owned by Gino
Tomassi, the same one he will be in next week.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart won the 2000 race at Irwindale in the same car he will
drive this year. He actually will be seeking a third Turkey Night
victory, having won a USAC TQ midget feature as part of the 1993
program at Bakersfield Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   After Stewart's win in 2000, he bought the car from Lewis to put
in his private collection in Rushville, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "When Tony told us he wanted to run again this year, we already
had our four midgets assigned so we had to get the car back from Tony
and freshen it up for next week's race," Lewis said. "It'll be just
like it was when he won in it."</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale officials announced Thursday that Stewart had also been
entered in the companion USAC Western State sprint car race in a car
owned by Larry Triguieiro. He is listed as a teammate of Jason
Leffler, who beat Stewart in the 1999 midget race.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has been one of USAC's most successful car owners since he
formed his first team with the late Stan Fox in 1979. Fox won the
final race at Ascot Park in 1990, which was also Lewis' first Turkey
Night win.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, my two ambitions were to own a midget car
and win Thanksgiving Night at Ascot," Lewis said. "For a midget guy,
it's like winning the Indianapolis 500."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, Lewis' cars have won seven USAC midget championships.</TE>
<TE>   "It's teamwork," Lewis said. "Bobby [East] builds the chassis in
Indianapolis, Ed [Pink] builds the engines in the [San Fernando]
Valley and Kelly Drake builds the cars in our shop in Laguna Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway has extended its schedule to feature
championship events postponed two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Running Saturday night will be super stocks, street stocks, champ
trucks and cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Burns of Riverside is 12 points ahead of John Caley of Glen
Avon in super stock, and George Bolden of Elsinore holds an
eight-point edge over Henry Wesoloski Sr. of Temecula in street
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Each main event winner receives 30 points. Racing will start
earlier than usual, at 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, CART and Ford announced a two-year marketing and
promotions agreement Thursday. CART President Chris Pook said the
deal would help draw new drivers to the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got two very significant [partners]: Bridgestone to supply
tires and Ford Motor Co. to supply engines," Pook said. "That's the
backbone of any racing series."</TE>
<TE>   The series will be known as "Bridgestone Presents the Champ Car
World Series Powered By Ford."</TE>
<TE>   The Bill Muncey Cup unlimited hydroplane race, held Sept. 22 on
San Diego's Mission Bay, will be shown Sunday at 10 a.m. on ESPN2....</TE>
<TE>   Paul Edwards, one of four drivers selected in Red Bull's search
for a future American Formula One driver, will compete in the
Telefonica Formula Nissan next year, a series similar to F3000, in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Hall will celebrate his 65th birthday today somewhere on the
Baja peninsula, between Ensenada and La Paz. Hall is competing in his
35th Baja 1000 in an AM Hummer. He is the only driver to have
competed in every event and has won in his class 16 times. Co-driving
will be his sons, Chad and Josh. The 1,017-mile race started Thursday
and the survivors among more than 240 entries will finish sometime
today.</TE>
<TE>   Gale Banks is looking for new fields to conquer in his world's
fastest pickup, a diesel-powered Dodge Dakota called the Banks
Sidewinder. The Azusa engineer recently averaged 217.314 mph in a
two-way run at the Bonneville Salt Flats, a record for pickups, gas
or diesel powered. Banks hopes to enter the street-legal pickup in
drag races and truck pulls to show not only its speed but its
durability.</TE>

<HD>Mavericks Win With Yao in a Zone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For two quarters, Yao Ming was nearly unstoppable. Then the Dallas
Mavericks showed why they've been unbeatable.</LD>
<LD>   The Mavericks made a halftime adjustment to collapse their zone
defense around Yao, then saw Michael Finley and Dirk Nowitzki lead
them to a 103-90 victory over the Houston Rockets on Thursday night
at Dallas, improving the Mavericks to 12-0.</LD>
<LD>   Finley had a season-high 28 points, including six three-point
baskets and Nowitzki had 24 points and nine rebounds as Dallas set a
franchise record for consecutive wins at any point in a season, and
tied for the fourth-best start in league history.</LD>
<TE>   The Mavericks' next goal is matching Boston's 14-0 start in
1957-58, then the record of 15-0 set by Washington in 1948-49 and
matched by Houston in 1993-94. Dallas next plays Saturday night at
home against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, the 7-foot-6 center from China who was the first pick in the
NBA draft, had his best night as a pro, with 30 points and 16
rebounds in 33 minutes. But he showed fatigue in the second half,
scoring only one point in the fourth quarter, when he did not take a
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 89, Seattle 85 -- Bonzi Wells scored 16 points and the
Trail Blazers took the lead for good with a 14-1 run to close the
third quarter at Seattle.</TE>

<HD>Sehorn Blasts NFL Drug, Ephedra Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Giant cornerback Jason Sehorn criticized the NFL for
treating first-time ephedra offenders more harshly than players
caught using cocaine, New York's Daily News reported.</LD>
<LD>   Sehorn, who said Wednesday that he used ephedra daily until last
spring, is upset that players testing positive for the
over-the-counter stimulant receive four-game suspensions, while a
positive first test for cocaine or marijuana results only in
placement in the NFL's drug treatment program.</LD>
<LD>   "You want to snort some cocaine, get yourself high, get caught,
now you go in a program," he said. "They put you in a drug program to
try to help you, which is good, but you can keep on playing."</LD>
<TE>   The NFL began year-round random testing for ephedra in July. It is
the first U.S. pro sports league to ban ephedrine, a substance often
found in strength-building food supplements and that can cause
seizures, strokes and even death.</TE>
<TE>   Sehorn also pointed to legal drugs provided by team doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-inflammatories, they pump us full of [pills], twice a
day, just to get you on the field," he said. "They'll give you a shot
right before a game. They'll give you a shot of cortisone before a
game. They will shoot you up with anything.</TE>
<TE>   "But you want to take some ephedra that is sold over the counter,
that is legal, that they're trying to say could kill you ... because
somebody died somewhere?</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to do us some favors, why don't you do some serious
testing on the stuff everybody in the league takes and is prescribed
by doctors."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb might not have
surgery on the broken right ankle that could sideline him for the
rest of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb returned to Philadelphia with a cast on the ankle after
meeting with a specialist in Houston. He will wear the cast until he
is examined again in about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although he could have surgery then, McNabb most likely will let
the bone heal on its own, even though an operation might allow him to
return to the lineup earlier. He was hurt on the third play of
Sunday's 38-14 victory over Arizona but stayed in for most of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Ram running back Marshall Faulk didn't practice
Thursday, sitting out because of a high sprain in his right ankle and
a strained tendon in his left foot. His status for Sunday's game at
Washington won't be determined until game time, Coach Mike Martz
said. Kurt Warner practiced for the first time since reclaiming the
No. 1 quarterback job from Marc Bulger.... San Diego Charger
linebacker Donnie Edwards and guard Bob Hallen returned to practice
Thursday, four days after sustaining concussions in an overtime
victory over the San Francisco 49ers.</TE>

<HD>Ex-UCLA Coach Smith Says Track Club Strong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last 16 months, John Smith has been sued for $1 million,
ended a 17-year coaching association with UCLA and watched star pupil
Maurice Greene's 100-meter world record fall to Tim Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   Like others in the track community, Smith heard whispers that the
HSI track club, headed by Smith and Emanuel Hudson, was faltering. He
laughed them off.</LD>
<LD>   "Anybody that thinks we're lost has not seen anything yet," Smith
said. "The elite athletes I'm working with, we're all connected
together. We have something to fight for. It's like they're saying,
'When it's bleak and dark and it seems like I'm on my last breath,
I've been able to perform my best.' I've watched each and every one
of them have their back against the wall and do their best."</LD>
<TE>   Smith's back is no longer in danger -- at least in the legal
sense. The civil suit filed in August 2001 by hurdler Anjanette
Kirkland, who claimed Smith grabbed her and punched her mother and
sister during an argument in a Eugene, Ore., hotel after the U.S.
championships, was settled recently. Terms were not made public.</TE>
<TE>   "Some very unfortunate things occurred. It's something I put
behind me," Smith said. "A lot of times you walk a line and a mistake
happens. I want to show people mistakes can happen and you can learn
from them and grow stronger."</TE>
<TE>   HSI last week added to its roster sprinter Angela Williams, the
only athlete ever to win four consecutive NCAA 100-meter dash titles.
Williams began working out Monday with Smith's core group, which
includes Greene, Ato Boldon, Torri Edwards, Inger Miller and Jon
Drummond.</TE>
<TE>   "With Angela, we're adding talent and character," Smith said.
"Those are the kind of people we want. We were founded on the
principle that you work hard every day. That's the flavor we have
now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched her run since she was a baby. She's been blessed
with a very competitive attitude and she had a great coach, Dr. Ernie
Gregoire. He got a PhD at a time there weren't many black men with
PhDs. That was inspiring for me. For me to work with one of the
students he had is the ultimate. My job is not to muck it up."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson, an attorney and agent, said HSI is hardly faltering.
"Around [the 2001 world championships in] Edmonton, we cleaned house.
We thought we'd do better with less people, but more serious people,"
he said. "We said we were going to get lean and start cherry picking.
The only person we've brought in is the only person who's won the
NCAA championships four times. Angela was a natural for us ....</TE>
<TE>   "With respect to our supposed demise, what's that quote? Rumors of
our death have been greatly exaggerated."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of Greene's decline are also untrue, Hudson said. Greene
and the others spent two weeks working out at the Olympic Training
Center in Chula Vista this month, and Hudson said Greene will compete
indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "My problem with Maurice is holding him down so he doesn't
overwork himself," Smith said. "He's had a tough year, as every great
person does sometimes. You go back to the basics and the things that
made you great.... Maurice understands you have to work hard, be
patient and humble, and you will get the results you desire."</TE>
<TE>   The Doctor Is In</TE>
<TE>   Swimmer Jenny Thompson didn't retire after she won three relay
gold medals and an individual bronze in the 100-meter freestyle at
Sydney to expand her collection to 10, more than any other female
Olympic swimmer.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford alumna merely stepped back a bit while she plunged
into medical school at Columbia University. But the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks inspired her to reevaluate her life.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so frustrating being in medical school and being so close
[to ground zero] but not being able to help," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me think, 'How can I help people?' And I realized that
when I left swimming, I hadn't helped people the way I wanted, like
being a role model and giving back to the sport."</TE>
<TE>   She began last summer in her hometown of Dover, N.H., working with
kids in the pool she swam in as a youngster and which has since been
named for her. While conducting clinics, she rediscovered her zest
for competition and made the U.S. team for the Pan Pacific meet,
setting a personal-best of 25.13 seconds in winning the 50 free.</TE>
<TE>   Although she's back in school and can fit in only 90 minutes'
training each evening, she's not ready to leave the pool. Eager to
test herself again, she will compete in this weekend's FINA World Cup
meet in East Meadow, N.Y., which has drawn an impressive array of
world-record holders and Olympic medalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working out consistently but not the amount of time I
used to, so I don't know where it will leave me," she said. "I
haven't had time to lift weights, either. I haven't competed against
the Europeans since the Olympics, so it will be great to see them and
the kids from the Pan Pacs."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson is inclined to aim for the 2004 Athens Games but knows
med school and serious training would create a difficult balancing
act.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to the med school and they're open about me taking
some time off to train," she said. "My days are very, very long, but
swimming has always been a great mental release for me, a stress
release."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Athletics Federations accepted a 7 a.m.
start for the men's and women's 2004 Olympic marathons, after saying
7 p.m. would be better because of lower temperatures. Organizers
rejected the later time because of concerns about light, TV coverage
and conflicts with the closing ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton gold medalist Jim Shea underwent surgery to improve blood
flow in his left leg, which he said was at nearly 50% during his
triumphs in February at Salt Lake City. He said the hereditary
condition will cause him to miss at least the first half of the World
Cup season.</TE>
<TE>   The international governing body of swimming ruled that all
swimmers who break world records must undergo a blood and urine test
for erythropoietin (EPO), which boosts endurance.</TE>
<TE>   Beatrisa Liang of Granada Hills won the Pacific Coast Sectional
figure skating championships last weekend in Salt Lake City.... The
U.S. women's water polo team, third last week at the Thetis Cup
tournament in Greece, will hold an open house at its training base in
Los Alamitos this weekend.</TE>

<HD>Rejuvenated Aussie Still Surfing at 36</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>

<DL>HALEIWA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>The big waves everyone had been hoping for arrived Wednesday under
the light of a big yellow moon. They boomed over the North Shore
reefs long before sunup.</LD>
<LD>   It was an exciting and perhaps restless night for dozens of young
pros competing in the first jewel of the $750,000 Vans Triple Crown
of Surfing, the $100,000 Hawaiian Pro at Haleiwa's Ali'i Beach Park
on Oahu.</LD>
<LD>   But not so for Australian surfer Mark Occhilupo. The sound of the
crashing surf was simply music to the ears.</LD>
<TE>   Occy, as he has been called for as long as he can remember, burst
onto the pro surfing tour at 16, with bushy blond hair and a grin
that seemed to span beyond his cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   That was 20 years ago. At 36, he's the tour's ranking relic, four
years older than his closest competitor and at least 10 years older
than most.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when he carried a cocky exuberance unmatched by
any of his older rivals. He is the oldest rival now. He still has
bushy blond hair but his exuberance is far less cocky -- and not
quite as exuberant.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not to say that a much mellower Occy is washed up. On
the contrary. In a fiercely competitive sport with a grueling tour
schedule that typically burns its participants to a crisp by the time
they reach their mid- to late 20s, he has settled into a situation
that suits him well and remains a contender in any heat against any
surfer.</TE>
<TE>   He proved that in 1999, after recovering from his own case of
burnout, when he became the oldest surfer to win the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals' prestigious world title. After slipping to 20th in
2000, he rebounded last year to finish second to C.J. Hobgood of
Satellite Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   And he's proving himself again this year. Occhilupo came into the
Triple Crown ranked 13th. On Wednesday at the Hawaiian Pro, he
advanced to the round of 32 and on Thursday, again carving hard,
backside turns on Haleiwa's towering right-breaking waves,
methodically surfed his way into the quarterfinals. He failed to
advance, however, largely because of a long flat spell -- during
which he needed only to score a 5.84 out of a possible 10 -- to end
his heat.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody takes him for granted, that's for sure," says Pat
O'Connell of San Clemente. At 31, O'Connell, who failed to advance
past the round of 64, is one of only a few surfers on the tour to
have lasted past 30. "It's really inspirational for us older guys to
see a guy like that."</TE>
<TE>   Occy's story is one any aging surfer can appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   He started surfing when he was 9, won his first amateur contest at
13 and followed that up with a couple of state titles. After the 10th
grade he left home to compete on a trial basis on the ASP tour.
Powerful, fast and aggressive, he surfed his way into the top 16 by
season's end.</TE>
<TE>   He blossomed throughout most of the 1980s, when pro surfing was
enjoying a renaissance and when Occy's battles against big-name pros
such as Tom Curren and Tom Carroll were legendary.</TE>
<TE>   Less legendary was his performance in the 1987 movie "North
Shore," which portrayed life on this part of Oahu during the big-wave
season and pegged pro surfers at the time as little more than
reckless party animals.</TE>
<TE>   But that was nothing compared with the fall Occy took a year
later, when he began to succumb to the tour and, perhaps, the
lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "I was still surfing well and highly ranked, but something deep
inside of me was telling me to go home," he says, with a drawn-out
Aussie drawl. "I just wasn't into it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   But it was more complex than that. Occy went home for more than
five years. He basically stopped surfing, "and anyone who stops
surfing scares me," he says, "because it's so much fun, especially if
you're a good surfer."</TE>
<TE>   He all but slipped out of sight. Most of his surfing was from the
couch with a channel changer. He ate constantly and ballooned to 245
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't remember exactly what inspired him to snap out of it,
but his primary sponsor, Billabong, had something to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me they couldn't justify paying my high salary --
because they had been paying it all along -- if all I was going to do
was sit on a couch and eat," Occy recalls, "so that was a big
factor."</TE>
<TE>   So was the gentle prodding of renowned filmmaker Jack McCoy, who
had developed a close relationship with the surfer and considered him
one of his favorite subjects. McCoy put Occy on a training schedule
that included a strict diet, lots of running and even more surfing.</TE>
<TE>   The result was an astonishing run that culminated with Occy being
crowned world champion for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just one of those amazing stories where he dug deep inside
himself and brought himself back," says Wayne "Rabbit" Bartholomew,
former world champion and current president of the ASP. "And in doing
so he proved that it's possible if you really have that much
self-belief, an unfaltering belief in your destiny, that you can
bring yourself back."</TE>
<TE>   So what's next for Occy? More surfing. He recently signed a
10-year contract with Billabong that will keep him employed as a
professional surfer until the not-so-tender age of 46.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really funny," he says with a laugh. "I've achieved pretty
much everything I wanted to in surfing now, but I don't have that
feeling to go home. I don't feel like I want to go home, so I go with
my gut feelings and I'm still going."</TE>
<TE>   A Sunny Day</TE>
<TE>   Former world champion Sunny Garcia, thanks largely to a
breathtakingly long tube ride in the four-man final, emerged the
winner of the Hawaiian Pro.</TE>
<TE>   It was a victory to make Occy proud. At 32, Garcia, of Honolulu,
is the second-oldest competitor on the tour and came into Thursday's
action showing his age -- and then some.</TE>
<TE>   His right knee, with two torn ligaments, was bandaged in duct
tape. His back was stiff and he sported a large gash over his right
eye, suffered in an earlier heat.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show that duct tape can fix anything," he joked
afterward. "It's good for dings on your board and, obviously, it's
good for other things."</TE>
<TE>   The five-time Triple Crown champion's victory was worth $10,000.
Australians Jake Paterson and Tom Whitaker finished second and third,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The next two legs of North Shore competition are at Sunset Beach
and Pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   East Versus West</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the Southland's most notable surfers in the Triple
Crown lineup made it past the round of 32. O'Connell (ranked No. 32
entering the Triple Crown) was the first to bow out, in the round of
64. Taylor Knox (No. 26) of Carlsbad and Shane Beschen (unranked) of
San Clemente were next.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Florida, which boasted five surfers in the top 15
going into the Triple Crown, had two of them -- six-time world
champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach and Damien Hobgood of Satellite
Beach -- make it to the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Florida seems to be outshining California as a pro
surfer factory, C.J. Hobgood, Damien's twin brother and a loser in
the round of 64, theorized that the biggest factor was the poor
quality of waves back home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest thing is that the waves are so bad and you
can't really mold your surfing to any certain way or style in
Florida," he said. "So a lot of these kids start traveling at a young
age and they're able to mold their surfing not to one thing but
adapting and learning these new waves."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell called that "an interesting theory."</TE>
<TE>   Sibling Rivalry</TE>
<TE>   C.J. and Damien Hobgood, ranked No. 13 and 14, respectively, are
one of three brother combinations on the tour, but they are the only
identical twins.</TE>
<TE>   The only bickering they did while growing up was minor -- except
when it involved cool stuff sponsors sent their way.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we used to fight all the time over that," said C.J., the
elder brother by a minute. "We used to get a box of clothes and lay
it out: all the shirts, the whole thing. We'd say, all right, you get
one shirt and I get one shirt. You get one pants, I get one pants.
That's the way our whole life was. There's cool stuff and there's
lame stuff. We had to fight over the cool stuff. And you think it's
great being a twin, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   The Hobgoods are 23.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Some of the North Shore's breaks have become overrun by women, a
recent phenomenon some say was fueled by the success of the movie
"Blue Crush," which introduced women's surfing and the North Shore
lifestyle to the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   After a surf session this week at Pupukea just north of Pipeline,
Strider Wasilewski, captain of the Quiksilver team of surfers camped
here for the season, said the situation was getting out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "I got all-out Blue Crushed," he said. "There were 30 girls out in
the water and they were calling me off of waves. I was like, 'Oh, my
gosh. What am I going to do?' But it's all right. Most of them are
really cute girls."</TE>

<HD>Is Neuheisel a Worm in the Apple?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know it's rivalry week in the conference when:</LD>
<LD>   * You can't pry more than one-sentence answers out of Washington
Coach Rick Neuheisel, the Pacific 10's resident Aunt Blabby.</LD>
<LD>   * USC does a better job wrapping up (in duct tape) Tommy Trojan
than its defenders wrapped up ballcarriers at Kansas State.</LD>
<TE>   * Oregon State shuts off media access for its starting tailback
last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   * Whiny Stanford fans begin their annual river in Egypt (denial)
rant over a semi-controversial finish against California 20 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The only rivalry game not on tap is Arizona vs. Arizona State,
deferred to its traditional Friday-after-Thanksgiving slot. This is
probably best, as it gives Arizona extra time to locate AWOL players
who might have wandered off into the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a quick primer on this weekend's matchups in order of
national ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (6-5, 3-4) at Washington State (9-1, 6-0)</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry in play: Apple Cup. The series began in 1900 but the Apple
Cup was not awarded to the winner until 1962. The trophy is not
really a cup either, and the winner also receives the Governor's
Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   At stake: There hasn't been a bigger Apple Cup for Washington
State, which, with a victory, can clinch its second Rose Bowl berth
in five years and also keep national-title hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Fear factor: Neuheisel closed practice to outsiders for the first
time in three years. At his weekly news conference, the usually
loquacious coach gave curt answers to questions -- Neuheisel on
Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser: "He is a good player."</TE>
<TE>   USC (8-2, 6-1) at UCLA (7-3, 4-2)</TE>
<TE>   Playing for: Victory Bell. The winner gets year-round, ding-dong
possession. The 295-pound bell was given as a gift to UCLA in 1939,
but USC students stole it the next year and someone eventually called
the cops. In 1942, as a truce, it was agreed the bell would be
awarded to the game's winner.</TE>
<TE>   At stake: The victor remains alive for the Pac-10 title, so long
as Washington State loses.</TE>
<TE>   Fear factor: A UCLA win calls into question the fiscal wisdom of
USC sending athletic department officials to campaign for a bowl
championship series bowl with two games left.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (7-4, 3-4) at Oregon State (7-4, 3-4)</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry in play: The Civil War. Stanford and Cal started two years
before, in 1892, but Oregon and Oregon State have met more times, 105
to 104.</TE>
<TE>   At stake: Not much, now that the radio rights issue has been
resolved. Two years ago, Oregon State wrecked Oregon's Rose Bowl
dreams. Last year, Oregon slugged out a 17-14 win to keep its
national-title hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Fear factor: That this will be as ugly as the 1983 game,
considered the worst played, when the teams finished in a scoreless
tie.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (2-8, 1-6) at California (6-5, 3-4)</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry in play: The Big Game.</TE>
<TE>   At stake: Revenge for 1982 game that Cal won, 25-20, on a
last-second kickoff return forever known as "The Play," ending when
Cal's Kevin Moen knocked down Stanford band member Gary Tyrrell in
the end zone. Tyrrell's trombone is in the College Football Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Fear factor: That it could be deja vu all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Aftermath</TE>
<TE>   It seemed a longshot Arizona Coach John Mackovic could keep his
job after the events of last week, in which 50-odd players marched on
the president's office to complain about the second-year coach.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic, however, went on a massive damage-control campaign,
securing on-air support from former ESPN colleague and ex-coach Lee
Corso.</TE>
<TE>   More important was Arizona's stunning, 52-41, circle-the-wagons
win at California.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic's future may still hinge on next week's final game
against rival Arizona State, although the Arizona coach said he
expects to be back next year. "I have been told nothing to the
contrary," Mackovic said.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic, who issued a tearful apology at last week's news
conference, said mistakes have been made on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the players did a poor job and I did a poor job of
communicating with each other," Mackovic said. "I think they had some
things that were bothering them and they never came and said, 'Let's
sit down.' I think I did a poor job of being able to sense that all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA's decision to uphold Cal's one-year bowl ban still leaves
the conference with seven eligible bowl teams and only six guaranteed
slots -- Rose, Holiday, Sun, Insight, Las Vegas and Silicon Valley.
If Washington State ends up in the Fiesta Bowl, everyone moves up a
rung and the Pac-10 has a place for all its schools. If Washington
State ends up in the Rose Bowl, though, the odd team out may be
Washington if it loses to Washington State and finishes 6-6. With a
12-game schedule this year, 6-6 teams are only allowed to play in
bowls contracted with their conference.</TE>
<TE>   How to get around this? If the Mountain West doesn't have an
eligible team to send to the Seattle Bowl, that game and the Pac-10
could simply sign a contract that would allow Washington to play at
home. From a business standpoint, the Seattle Bowl would be thrilled
to have Washington. This move would not thrill 9-2 South Florida, an
independent trying to find an at-large spot somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line? That's the bowl business, as USC may find out if it
caps a 10-2 season with a win over Notre Dame and loses a $13-million
Orange Bowl berth to the 10-2 Fighting Irish.</TE>
<TE>   The man to blame for the NCAA not rescinding its bowl ban on Cal?
Look no further than former basketball coach Todd Bozeman. The NCAA
bought a lot of Cal's argument for reversal and even returned nine
scholarships that were initially stripped. But the NCAA stuck to its
position on the bowl ban because the Golden Bears were "repeat
offenders" thanks to violations incurred in the mid-1990s in the
basketball program.</TE>

<LD>Repechage. It's the rage in New Zealand this week.</LD>
<LD>   A new Down Under rock band? A dance craze?</LD>
<LD>   Rowing and fencing fans will recognize it as the scheme for giving
losers a second chance. Pronounced rep-uh-shazh, it's a French term
defined as (a) to recover, as to fish a body out of water, or (b) in
sports, to let a weaker candidate through.</LD>
<TE>   In the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials for the America's Cup,
that's what it's all about, starting today.</TE>
<TE>   Team Dennis Conner's best boat, Stars &amp; Stripes USA 77, was fished
out of the water off Long Beach in July and made its debut last week
by drubbing Britain's GBR, 4-1, in the lower bracket of the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Victory Challenge survived by winning the other sail-off
between bottom feeders. The Swedes sent France's hapless Le Defi
Areva (3-18) packing by the same score.</TE>
<TE>   How hapless were the French? They couldn't spell their own word.
Their press handouts called it "repecharge," like a credit card.
Meanwhile, in the upper bracket, Switzerland's Kiwi-powered Alinghi
and San Francisco's Oracle BMW ran the table to sail straight into
next month's semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Coutts, with the core of his crew that has won the last
two Cups for New Zealand, took Switzerland's Prada to 3-0, at which
point the Italians conceded, giving themselves maximum time for boat
modifications before the knockout rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's OneWorld kept getting up off the mat against Oracle but
still lost, 4-0. Oracle is 11-0 since owner Larry Ellison recalled
skipper Chris Dickson from exile and Dickson showed his gratitude by
replacing Ellison on the boat with a real professional sailor.</TE>
<TE>   The setback left OneWorld, the highest ranking top bracket loser,
with the privilege of picking its opponent in the repechage. The
choices were Prada, which pushed Alinghi to consecutive eight-second
wins; Stars &amp; Stripes, suddenly looking fast after changing boats,
and Victory, which is 0-8 against the top four.</TE>
<TE>   A no-brainer? Even Victory skipper Jesper Bank said, "We've seen
quite a performance increase in the Stars &amp; Stripes campaign. I would
be a little worried picking Stars &amp; Stripes."</TE>
<TE>   So, OneWorld picked Stars &amp; Stripes, which left Prada to race the
Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   The only explanation OneWorld offered came from syndicate Chief
Executive Gary Wright: "Each of these teams are extremely challenging
... [and] must be taken extremely seriously. We put it to the team,
and at the end of the day we determined that this was the right
decision for us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Stars &amp; Stripes skipper Ken Read, "Nobody likes to be picked.
It's a humbling thing in a way, but at the same time our team has
taken it as a chance to get a little mad. You know, these guys think
we're the worst of the heap, so let's go prove them wrong. Frankly,
we think we have the ability to do that."</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld has become an enigma. The team has plenty of money with
not one but two billionaires, Craig McCaw and Paul Allen, signing
checks. It has plenty of talent, with Cup veteran Peter Gilmour of
Australia leading an internationally mixed crew that includes hotshot
Aussie helmsman James Spithill, Americans Charlie McKee and Morgan
Larson and several New Zealand defectors, including a first-rate
bowman, Alan Smith. Its boats were designed by Laurie Davidson, who
created Team New Zealand's successful defenders in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, OneWorld was one of only two teams, along with Team DC, to
switch boats before the quarterfinals after slipping from 8-0 to 5-3
in the two round robins. Then, getting shut out by Oracle offered
little encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   France's premature departure is a familiar rite dating to the
'50s.</TE>
<TE>   The French have never been seriously competitive. There was more
remorse for the Brits, who have a stake in the event's 19th century
origins but hadn't competed since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived inexperienced but their downfall might have been a
boat with a too-weird underwater configuration that they wouldn't
reveal.</TE>
<TE>   The boat was difficult to steer, especially through the tight
maneuvers required in the pre-start period to gain initial advantage.
Sometimes it would just go dead in the water, reminiscent of others'
experiments with fore-and-aft rudders or double keels.</TE>
<TE>   After the final loss to Stars &amp; Stripes, skipper Ian Walker said,
"Today, our light went out. Our hope's gone. I don't cry very often
but today I had a tear in my eye."</TE>

<HD>Herzog, Aguinaga Reach 100</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two 34-year-old players on opposite sides of the Atlantic achieved
significant personal milestones this week, each playing in his 100th
international game.</LD>
<LD>   Andreas Herzog of Austria and Alex Aguinaga of Ecuador reached
that mark on Wednesday, joining a select group of 73 men worldwide
who have represented their country that many times.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course, the 100th game is something special," Herzog said in
Vienna, where Austria was beaten by Norway, 1-0. "I am the first
Austrian to have made it."</LD>
<TE>   Aguinaga is the first player from Ecuador to join the so-called
"century club," and he did so in even better fashion than Herzog,
scoring Ecuador's first goal in a 2-2 tie with Costa Rica in Quito,
Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Aguinaga, who made his national team debut against Colombia in
1989, has spent almost all of his professional career with Necaxa in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Beasley Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Fire and United States national team winger DaMarcus
Beasley underwent arthroscopic surgery Thursday to remove torn
cartilage in his left knee and will be sidelined for eight to 10
weeks, the Major League Soccer club announced.</TE>
<TE>   USA-Japan</TE>
<TE>   The United States women's national team will open the 2003 season
with a game against Japan in San Diego on Jan. 12. The match will
serve as preparation for the Four Nations Cup in China that month.</TE>
<TE>   New Senegal Coach</TE>
<TE>   Guy Stephan, an assistant coach for France at the 2002 World Cup,
has agreed to coach Senegal, the team that upset France in the
tournament's opening game.</TE>
<TE>   Stephan, 45, who coached Olympique Lyon and Girondins Bordeaux in
the French league, will take charge in mid-December. His three-year
contract runs through qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. He replaces
Bruno Metsu, who led Senegal to the quarterfinals at Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Burgos Retires</TE>
<TE>   German Burgos, who played 34 games for Argentina and was a member
of its World Cup squad, retired from international soccer.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old goalkeeper made the announcement in Spain, saying
he hoped the decision would prolong his career at Atletico Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Lokomotiv Wins Title</TE>
<TE>   A goal by Dmitry Loskov five minutes into the game gave Lokomotiv
Moscow a 1-0 victory over CSKA in Moscow and earned the club the
Russian league title, the first in its 67-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The teams had finished the season tied atop the standings and
played a one-game playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Honduran Surprise</TE>
<TE>   A headed goal by Milton "Tyson" Nunez in the 76th minute was
enough to give Honduras a 1-0 victory over South American champion
Colombia, which fielded a young and untested team, at San Pedro Sula,
Honduras, Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   One More Referee</TE>
<TE>   Tired of controversial decisions and subsequent complaints from
players and coaches, the German Bundesliga has decided to add a
fourth official to assist the referee, starting Jan. 25 after the
league's six-week midwinter break.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the fourth referee will be a great help," FIFA referee
Herbert Fandel told Reuters. "He will be able to support the first
assistant, whose duty is complicated by the theatrics going on on the
bench."</TE>

revives vivid memories</DH>

<LD>You may have seen the videotape over the years and, if not, you'll no
doubt get another chance this week to savor "The Play," the
California Bears' wild-eyed run into college football history.</LD>
<LD>   The 20th anniversary of Cal's helter-skelter dash for the Stanford
end zone arrives this week and, as one who was there, I am here to
say: Check out the videotape that will make the sports highlight
shows this week. Listen to the sports blooper-style descriptions that
spill off the commentators' tongues. And know that being there was so
much better.</LD>
<LD>   In Berkeley, there is many a path to personal identity. Drummers
stage daylong jams on the quad. Hacky sacks fly from the feet of
young men in dreadlocks. A Chaucer scholar strides across campus in
combat boots. And an optimistic few wrap themselves in blue and gold
and make the climb up the hill to Memorial Stadium. They make up
perhaps the oddest clique of all -- that of the Cal football fan.</LD>
<TE>   By the time "The Play" rolled around on Nov. 20, 1982, I had been
fully indoctrinated into this quirky subculture. I had four years of
undergraduate rooting under my belt. I'd joined friends on an
implausible motor home odyssey all the way to Nebraska, where we met
kindly farmers and watched giant red Cornhuskers roll over the
scrappy Golden Bears. I'd once even broken into the stadium on the
hill in Berkeley with my drunken pals and spent a night on the field
near the "Andy Smith Bench". (Smith coached Cal to several undefeated
seasons in the 1920s.) And, only a year before, I had been sports
editor of the campus paper, the Daily Californian.</TE>
<TE>   By game day two decades ago, this native Southern Californian had
bought into the culture of the Golden Bears. That meant obsessing on
the Cal-Stanford rivalry above all others and earnestly accepting
that the annual football showdown truly was "The Big Game."</TE>
<TE>   Stanfordites fill the stadium with catcalls at us "weenies," and
maybe even float a giant helium-filled frankfurter over the stands to
make their point. Cal fans respond by storming the field and tackling
the Stanford mascot -- a giant, dancing tree. Anyone wearing "lowly
Stanford red" into Cal's rooting section probably will leave
shirtless and, possibly, bruised.</TE>
<TE>   In the decade leading up to the 1982 game, several Cal-Stanford
matchups had come down to the last possession. The schools' all-time
series was close to even (OK, Stanford won a few more games) and the
two teams, after nearly 100 years of football, had scored nearly an
identical number of points. Who needed Rose Bowls?</TE>
<TE>   Cal (6-4) had the home-field advantage that year, playing in
intimate Memorial Stadium (once rated by a national sports magazine
as one of the best places in the country to watch bad football). But
Stanford (5-5) had something better, it seemed. It had the best
player on the field and maybe the best in the country, quarterback
John Elway.</TE>
<TE>   Even before its sublime ending, the game unfolded as a classic.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears' first two touchdowns came on brilliant catches that
would have been the talk of any other season. Mariet Ford, a
diminutive wide receiver, delivered the first score with a diving
catch at the back of the end zone, clawing an overthrown ball into
his body from a full layout position. In the fourth quarter, Cal
retook the lead when beefy Wes Howell went horizontal just across the
goal line and snagged the ball in his giant, basketball player hands.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Stanford fans had seen enough of Cal and the referees.
Each time Cal quarterback Gale Gilbert threw the ball, no matter how
far off the mark, they would rise and thrust their hands over their
heads in mock "touchdown!" salutes .... Smart alecks.</TE>
<TE>   Cal's two early leads did not last and, as the shadows began to
lengthen over Strawberry Canyon, Elway got the ball back one last
time. There was only 1:27 left. Everyone present knew this uber
athlete was more than prepared to bring Stanford back again.</TE>
<TE>   At first, luck was with the Bears. Elway first threw for a loss,
then had two passes fall incomplete. Stanford faced fourth down and
17 yards to go, deep in its own end of the field. I could say it
seemed to be a miracle that Elway picked his way free of the
ferocious Cal blitz on fourth down, before firing the ball 29 yards
downfield in a perfect strike to wide receiver Emile Harry. It seemed
to be what always happens when Cal and harsh reality collide.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford kicker Mark Harmon was soon on the field and we watched,
our stomachs in knots, as the inevitable field goal fell through the
goal posts in the north end zone. Stanford seemed to have it won,
20-19. When the Leland Stanford Jr. University marching band struck
up its fight song, "All Right Now," all we could do was gape at the
field, zombie-like.</TE>
<TE>   Our sick-hearted anger and gallows attempts at a few new
expletives may have been all that kept us in the stands for what
happened next. We watched Stanford kick the ball off to a Cal team so
disorganized and demoralized that it managed, initially, to get only
nine members of the kickoff return team on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Andy Bark, one of those who should have been on the
field, told me recently that he was so dispirited that he was already
walking off the field, his head down.</TE>
<TE>   To even approach the sense of wonder at what happened next, don't
watch the videotape. Instead, try to listen to the radio call of
Cal's longtime play-by-play man, Joe Starkey. A Web site for Bear
fanatics (www.cyberbears.org) carries a clip of Starkey's call (click
on "The Play," audio).</TE>
<TE>   What it lacks in accuracy and precision -- Starkey never did spit
out the word "lateral" -- the frantic radio account more than makes
up for with emotional wallop.</TE>
<TE>   When the short kick from Stanford landed near midfield, it was
picked up by a veteran defensive back and former high school option
quarterback, Kevin Moen. Moen, now a real estate broker on the Palos
Verdes Peninsula, immediately looked to the sideline where a fellow
defensive back and former high school option man, Richard Rodgers,
was lurking.</TE>
<TE>   Moen's overhand toss reached Rodgers cleanly and he began picking
his way upfield, with Stanford defenders coming on hard. At that
point, Rodgers stopped abruptly and pitched back to a freshman
running back, Dwight Garner, who was promptly met by three or four
Stanford tacklers. Garner began to crumple to the turf but managed to
keep his upper body free and twisted backward to push another lateral
back to Rodgers. Stanford fans seem to feel obligated to insist that
Garner's knee hit the ground at this point, and that the play should
have been whistled dead. (Seemingly, there is no sense of
serendipity, down on The Farm.)</TE>
<TE>   The play was not blown dead, allowing Rodgers to loop back to the
middle of the field, with Ford, the agile receiver, sweeping
convoy-style, on his outside shoulder. Soon, the ball was in Ford's
hands and he was speeding straight toward the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, the floppy-hatted Stanford band had seen the clock
reach 00:00 and decided it was time to take the field for a late fall
frolic. A good quarter of the turf was covered with red and white
band members -- not to mention extra players and penalty flags by the
time Ford completed the fifth, last, and most miraculous lateral of
all.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears' most valuable player threw himself at two of the last
Stanford defenders, while blindly flinging the ball over his
shoulder. The now magical pigskin hung in the air for a moment,
before dropping neatly into the hands of Moen, who had set the whole
exchange in motion. No. 26 rumbled past the last Stanford defender
and into the end zone, where his jubilant leap into the air carried
him crashing into Gary Tyrrell and his unfortunate trombone.</TE>
<TE>   People are lying if they tell you that, in that moment, they knew
what happened. All of us waited, hearts in our mouths, as the
referees huddled on the far sideline to decide who had won the game.</TE>
<TE>   But, in another measure of the bedlam that had descended, a
scruffy fan in a brown Windbreaker had made his way to the edge of
the referees' huddle. It was not referee Charles Moffett but this
Unknown Cal Fan who first emerged from the officials' circle and
threw his hands skyward. Touchdown Bears!</TE>
<TE>   On the radio, Starkey gasped and then hurtled into one last,
breathless, exultation:</TE>
<TE>   "And the Bears ... the Bears have won ... The Bears have won! Oh
my God! The most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heart-rending,
exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football!"</TE>
<TE>   The stadium erupted. Never before or since have I rushed a field.
But on this day, there was really no choice. Suddenly our feet were
flying down the wooden benches toward the field. I was hugging
strangers. I was smacking a very large offensive lineman (George
Niualiku, who played every down that season) on the shoulders and
shrieking. Who knows what I said? Who cares?</TE>
<TE>   In the south and west grandstands, the bulk of the Stanford
faithful remained locked in their places, as if frozen in their
tracks by some giant, unseen lava flow.</TE>
<TE>   The celebration only got richer in the moments after Cal's 25-20
win.</TE>
<TE>   On television that night we saw the Stanford coaches mewling over
how they had been cheated. They would miss a trip to the Hall of Fame
Bowl that year and at, the end of the next season, coach Paul Wiggin
would be out of a job. Some said he never quite recovered from "The
Play."</TE>
<TE>   Elway stood in the locker room and ranted about how the officials
"ruined" his last college game, turning it into "a farce and a joke."
Was that even a sniffle we heard from Big John? Nah, just wishful
thinking. I talked to a Stanford teammate the other day who said
that, if the rumors are true, Elway has gotten over the ignominy of
Nov. 20 and could even smile about the outcome now. That's nice.</TE>
<TE>   Moen said he has attended so many tributes over the years,
including the 100th anniversary of the Big Game a few years back,
that he sees more of trombonist Tyrrell than he does of his old
teammates. Tonight, on the eve of this season's game, some Cal and
Stanford players from the 1982 teams will gather for the first time
"to swap stories and have a good time," said Moen, one of the
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   He still enjoys hearing what everyone else saw and heard that
afternoon. All the perspectives assure that the tale of
Moen-to-Rodgers-to-Garner-to-Rodgers-to-Ford-to-Moen becomes etched
still deeper in the Cal memory book.</TE>
<TE>   One day soon, I will take my three kids to the Big Game. I will
ask them to breathe deep the air of another crisp Northern California
fall. And I'll ask them to look out on one playing field where the
inevitable wasn't, the possible was and we had reason to believe that
the whole world was opening up before us.</TE>

<HD>Papadakis Wants Last Laugh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who know Petros Papadakis say that someday a Hollywood agent
is going to discover him and, quicker than you can say "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding," he's going to be a star.</LD>
<LD>   Hanging with Papadakis is a laugh a minute. It's one self-effacing
crack after another.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a captain on the worst USC team in history," he says,
referring to the 2000 team that tied for last in the Pacific 10.</LD>
<TE>   Papadakis is of Greek descent, and his family owns a restaurant in
San Pedro, Papadakis Taverna.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had seen "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which is about a
Greek family that owns a restaurant, Papadakis said, "Why would I
want to see the movie? I live it."</TE>
<TE>   Papadakis resembles Adam Sandler, and is just as funny. But
Papadakis just laughs when it's suggested that he should become an
actor.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he enjoys what he is doing. He's the USC analyst on Fox
Sports Net's "Southern California Sports Report," paired with former
UCLA quarterback and current radio commentator Matt Stevens.
Papadakis also works for USC flagship radio station KMPC (1540) as a
pregame host and sideline reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net publicity director Dennis Johnson invited a few
reporters to meet with Papadakis and Stevens at Papadakis Taverna
this week. Johnson, a USC grad, claimed he didn't know that the San
Pedro-Peninsula Trojan Club had scheduled a meeting at the restaurant
at the same time. USC band members and song girls were also there. It
was a sea of cardinal and gold.</TE>
<TE>   But then someone wearing a Bruin shirt showed up. It was James
Brown -- not the sportscaster, but a 1989 UCLA graduate who owns the
San Pedro Brewing Co., located a few doors down from Papadakis
Taverna. In the interest of equal time, he invited the group to his
bar-restaurant after dinner.</TE>
<TE>   When the group arrived at Brown's establishment, Stevens had a
surprise for Papadakis. He had gone to his car to get his UCLA
jersey, the one he wore when he led the Bruins to a victory over Iowa
in the 1986 Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Papadakis has to wear the jersey on the air this week. He and
Stevens, who have been making Pac-10 picks all season, both had 26-22
records after last weekend. A coin flip was held, and Papadakis lost.</TE>
<TE>   Papadakis, being a good sport, put on the jersey -- and took some
good-natured ribbing from Bruin fans at Brown's place.</TE>
<TE>   All night, Papadakis and Stevens went back and forth about who is
going to win Saturday's game. It was a fun time. It's the way things
are supposed to be during USC-UCLA Week.</TE>
<TE>   USC-UCLA Notes</TE>
<TE>   The 12:30 p.m. game is being televised by ABC only on the West
Coast, with Keith Jackson and Dan Fouts announcing. However, the ABC
affiliates in San Francisco and Portland are not televising the game.
They are carrying California-Stanford and Oregon-Oregon State,
respectively.... The USC-UCLA radio broadcast on KXTA (1150) with
Chris Roberts and Stevens will be carried by Armed Forces Radio. It
will be heard in more than 177 countries around the world.... Of
course the game is also on KMPC with Pete Arbogast and Paul McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   More College Football</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Tom Hammond, who has been recovering from heart bypass
surgery, returns to work this weekend, calling the Notre Dame-Rutgers
game with Pat Haden.... Brent Musburger and Gary Danielson are the
announcers for Ohio State-Michigan on ABC at 9 a.m. ... Maybe ESPN
should televise "College GameDay" from Ivy League sites more often.
Last Saturday's edition, televised from Philadelphia's Franklin
Field, drew a record 1.524 million viewers. The previous record was
1.494 million on Nov. 18, 2000, for a show at Tallahassee, Fla., site
of the Florida-Florida State game.... Saturday's "College GameDay"
will originate from Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Regionalizing the NFL?</TE>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue told the Federal Communications
Bar this week that the league is considering regionalizing its Sunday
night and Monday night games to boost ratings, meaning the West Coast
would get more West Coast teams.</TE>
<TE>   Might not be a bad idea. The Oakland Raiders' victory over New
England on Sunday night on ESPN drew a 9.7 rating, one of the highest
L.A. ratings for an NFL telecast on cable.</TE>
<TE>   But if the NFL goes to a split-national regional format, it
probably wouldn't happen before the current television contract
expires after the 2005 season.</TE>
<TE>   X Games to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN announced Thursday that the 2003 and 2004 X Games will be
held in Los Angeles. Staples Center will serve as the primary venue.
Next year, the event will be held Aug. 14-18. A news conference
detailing the plans will be held next month, after Mayor James Hahn
returns from Asia.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR Wrapup</TE>
<TE>   NBC reported Thursday that its final NASCAR race of the season got
a national rating of 5.2 with an 11 share, NASCAR's best rating on an
NFL Sunday. NBC's NASCAR ratings increased 13% this year and 59% over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Weber, the host of NBC's pre-race shows who also serves as a
pit reporter during the races, points out that one of the reasons for
NASCAR's popularity is that all the big names are in the 43-car
fields every week. It's not like golf, where Tiger Woods picks his
spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Every weekend is an all-star weekend," Weber said. "Every weekend
you've got the 43 best guys in the sport all on one track."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will have a special one-hour Laker pregame show
tonight at 6:30, in anticipation of Shaquille O'Neal's return.... The
Clippers make their first ESPN appearance tonight. Mike Tirico and
Tom Tolbert will announce their game at Denver.... The Clippers' home
game against Houston Sunday at 12:30 p.m. will be on Telemundo
(Channel 52).</TE>
<TE>   Marge Hearn and Jerry West will be among the special guests at
Staples Center on Sunday night, when the Lakers honor Chick Hearn.
Marge and Jeanie Buss will be part of the pregame show on Fox Sports
Net at 6 p.m. ... TNT announced a tripleheader for Martin Luther King
Day, Jan. 20, with the Clippers and Lakers meeting in the third
game.... DirecTV has announced a new six-year agreement to continue
carrying the NBA League Pass pay package and NBA TV, which will begin
carrying games after the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   HBO will commemorate its 500th fight Saturday when it televises a
rematch between Micky Ward and Arturo Gatti from Atlantic City, N.J.
Ward scored a decision over Gatti in May. Saturday's telecast, which
begins at 6:45 p.m. and also features a replay of last weekend's Erik
Morales-Paulie Ayala fight, will have the feel of an old-time boxing
telecast.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Although Charles Barkley was wrong about Houston's Yao Ming ever
scoring 19 points, he sometimes does make a lot of sense.</TE>
<TE>   A guest on Dan Patrick's ESPN radio show this week, Barkley was
asked about Allen Iverson's comment that he feared a Philadelphia
policeman might kill him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just stupid," said Barkley, who used to play in
Philadelphia. "If you don't want to be bothered by cops, then just
obey the law. Most cops are good people and do a job that nobody else
would do."</TE>

<LD>The Bruins got a short pep talk from first-year Athletic Director Dan
Guerrero after an upbeat and lively practice.</LD>
<LD>   "This is his first [UCLA-USC] game," Coach Bob Toledo said.</LD>
<LD>   Toledo was smiling because there are no off-field problems. Two
days before the USC game a year ago, the arrests of quarterback Cory
Paus for driving under the influence came to light.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel good about ourselves, and I feel good," Toledo said.
"We're excited about playing a meaningful game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Ricky Manning apologized for obscene comments he
made about USC at a bonfire and rally on the UCLA campus Tuesday
night. Speaking in front of an estimated 1,500 Bruin fans, Manning
led an obscene chant that was caught on camera by a local television
station.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl officials suggest that fans arrive at least three hours
before the 12:30 kickoff and avoid the 110 Freeway and the Orange
Grove and Colorado boulevard exits off the 134 Freeway. An alternate
route is to take the 2 Freeway to the 210 east and exit at Berkshire,
Seco/Mountain or Arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manning must appear in Superior Court today, but his preliminary
hearing is expected to be delayed until January. He was charged with
felony assault stemming from a fight in April.... Receiver Ryan Smith
received permission from UCLA doctors to have a foot specialist
perform surgery on his ankle Dec. 4.... There are fewer than 1,000
tickets available for Saturday's game.</TE>

<LD>   That fact alone is what Loyola Coach Paul Krumpe considers a
significant point in his five-year tenure. The Lions (14-3-2) have
come a long way in that time, evolving from a second-division West
Coast Conference team into a bona fide top 25 program.</LD>
<LD>   "This was something we talked about at the beginning of the
season," Krumpe said. "We wanted to be high enough [in the ranking]
to host a playoff game. It's a milestone."</LD>
<TE>   This is the Lions' second consecutive trip to the postseason. It
is the first for Cal State Northridge in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors (14-4-2) finished second in the Big West Conference
behind UC Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara plays San Diego on Saturday at
home.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors have been improving since Terry Davila, a former
player and assistant, returned as head coach four years ago. This
season, which has included a school-record 14 wins, has brought many
rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Edwin Miranda was named Big West defensive player of the
year, senior Joe Barton was the top goalie and Davila was conference
coach of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great reward for our kids," Davila said. "We're very
excited."</TE>
<TE>   Krumpe is impressed with what Davila has accomplished at
Northridge. The winner of Saturday's match plays at UCLA on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry has done a great job with that program," Krumpe said.
"There's so many similarities between our program and theirs. It is
no longer a one-team show here in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redlands received its first NCAA Division III football playoff
berth in nine years and third in school history after winning the
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletics Conference
championship. The Bulldogs (7-2) will play St. John's University
(9-1) on Saturday in Collegeville, Minn. Redlands won the SCIAC by
defeating Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 39-29, last week.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa Pacific did not receive a berth into the 16-team NAIA
playoffs despite posting a 9-1 record. The Cougars, who were ranked
14th last week and defeated Gustavus Adolphus, 20-14, saw their
playoff bid hurt when tournament teams Montana Western and St.
Ambrose (Iowa) upset top-five teams and leaped past them in the final
poll.</TE>

<LD>Last season: 22-10 overall, 12-6 in Pacific 10 Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Finish: Tied for second in conference, advanced to the title game
of the Pac-10 tournament and, as the No. 3-seeded team, lost to
Arizona. Seeded fourth in the South Regional of the NCAA tournament,
USC was upset in the first round by 13th-seeded North Carolina
Wilmington.</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Henry Bibby, seventh season, 103-77.</LD>
<TE>   Who's gone: David Bluthenthal, Gennaro Busterna, Sam Clancy and
Brandon Granville.</TE>
<TE>   Who's new: Guards Brandon Brooks and Roy Smiley, forward Jeff
McMillan and center Jonathan Oliver.</TE>
<TE>   Projected starters: Forward Nick Curtis (1.0 points, 0.8
rebounds), guards Errick Craven (11.8 points, 4.4 rebounds), Desmon
Farmer (9.5 points, 3.3 rebounds) and Robert Hutchinson (2.0 points,
1.6 assists) and center Rory O'Neil (4.3 points, 2.3 rebounds).</TE>
<TE>   Keys to season: Moving on. Having lost what Bibby referred to as
"the cornerstones" of his program -- Bluthenthal, Clancy and
Granville -- USC must forge a new identity, and quickly. And whoever
wins the three-man point guard battle among highly touted newcomer
Brooks, sophomore Derrick Craven and senior Hutchinson by the time
conference play opens will dictate that personality. Also, regaining
the services of the suspended Jerry Dupree, who changes the flow of a
game with his shot-blocking ability, will lessen the sting of losing
the Big Three, as will more consistent play from the enigmatic
Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The rebuilding Trojans open a season unranked for the
first time in three years. But after Arizona and Oregon, the Pac-10
is wide open and the Trojans could finish anywhere from third to
eighth. Still, Bibby has the Trojans right where he wants them,
flying under the national radar. Plus, a less-than-compelling
nonconference schedule can help the Trojans get some victories and
gain confidence entering Pac-10 play. How well and how soon the three
junior college transfers -- Brooks, Smiley and Oliver -- adapt to
Bibby's system could make the difference between a school-record
third consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament -- where the Trojans, a
popular pick to reach the Final Four last season, unexpectedly fell
in the first round -- or another lackluster date in the National
Invitation Tournament.</TE>

<HD>Big Day for McCullough</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC played its homecoming game last week. Trojan running back Sultan
McCullough will play a personal one on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   McCullough, a senior tailback from Pasadena, played three games in
the Rose Bowl for Pasadena Muir High. In 2000, he rushed for 105
yards and scored a touchdown in 26 carries for USC in a 38-35 victory
over UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have a lot of people there watching," McCullough said
Thursday. "I'm looking forward to having a couple big runs."</LD>
<TE>   McCullough will back up senior Justin Fargas for the fourth
consecutive game, but he remains the Trojans' leading rusher with 665
yards and has scored six touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Last week against Arizona State, he broke a 59-yard run and
finished with 69 yards in four carries.</TE>
<TE>   USC could play in the Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day if the
Trojans defeat UCLA and Washington State loses to Washington and
UCLA. The Trojans also could play in the Rose Bowl if they win their
remaining games, and Washington State does the same and advances to
the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the outcome against UCLA, McCullough said he will
honor a personal tradition on his exit from the stadium on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I walk home every time I play there, so I'm going to make that
walk with a smile on my face," McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cunningham, Vince Evans and Ron Yary were among dozens of
former players who attended practice and a dinner afterward.... Coach
Pete Carroll said receiver Mike Williams (thigh bruise) and other
players nursing nagging injuries would be ready for the Bruins.
"We're in good enough shape," Carroll said. "Everyone we're counting
on is going to play."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BRANDON BROOKS (Guard)</LD>
<LD>   No. 0, 6-1, 170, Sophomore: Brooks has been called one of the best
high school point guards to come out of Portland, Ore., an impressive
list that includes Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire. The
junior college transfer has not played competitively in two years but
as a Jefferson High senior, Brooks was an All-American who averaged
21 points, nine assists and four steals.</LD>
<LD>   No. 15, 6-11, 260, senior: The injury bug that has followed
Charissis has bitten him again as he has been slowed in the preseason
after aggravating a stress fracture in his left ankle. He started 18
of 20 games last season but sat out the last eight after breaking the
ankle stepping on a ball during pregame warmups.</LD>
<TE>*--*
KOSTAS CHARISSIS (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>*--*
DERRICK CRAVEN (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 24, 6-2, 200, sophomore: Craven, who has put on 30 pounds of
muscle and looks as though he should be playing strong safety for the
football team, is in a three-way battle for the starting point guard
position with newcomer Brooks and senior Robert Hutchinson. The
younger of the Craven twins, by one minute, Derrick is also a
defensive stopper.</TE>
<TE>*--*
ERRICK CRAVEN (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 22, 6-2, 190, sophomore: The elder Craven's 376 points last
season were the most by a USC freshman since Harold Miner scored 578
in 1989-90. Craven was also the first freshman to lead the Pacific 10
in steals (68) since Jason Kidd in 1993. Craven, who started 28 of 32
games, is USC's leading returning scorer and is expected to pick up
the offensive slack left by the departure of three senior starters.</TE>
<TE>*--*
NICK CURTIS (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 2, 6-8, 220, sophomore: After starting USC's first two games
as a freshman, Curtis did not play in the Trojans' final three games
last season. That is expected to change this season as Curtis, a
strong rebounder, will be counted on to grab the boards that Sam
Clancy took with him to the NBA. Curtis has also displayed
three-point shooting range.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JERRY DUPREE (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 31, 6-7, 200, junior: With his acrobatic dunks and blocked
shots, Dupree was the star of the Trojans' run to the Pac-10
tournament's title game at Staples Center last spring. But a
suspension handed down by Coach Henry Bibby has some wondering if
Dupree will ever rejoin the team.</TE>
<TE>*--*
DESMON FARMER (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 33, 6-4, 225, junior: For two seasons, Farmer has teased
teammates and Trojan fans with his electric yet erratic brand of
play. After coming on strong down the stretch, coming off the bench
to average 17.6 points in USC's final five games, Farmer insists that
he will be more consistent this year.</TE>
<TE>*--*
GREGG GUENTHER JR. (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 13, 6-8, 245, sophomore: A tight end on the football team,
Guenther joined the basketball team last season in time to give it
much-needed size down low. He started three of the nine games he
appeared in and will again be looked on to bring a gridiron mentality
and toughness to the paint.</TE>
<TE>*--*
ROBERT HUTCHINSON (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 4, 6-1, 185, senior: Last year's team captain is solid but
unspectacular, as evidenced by his 2.29-1 assist-turnover ratio.
Though he has started only three of the 62 games in which he has
played at USC and averaged 1.5 points and 1.2 assists in 9.5 minutes,
Hutchinson may open the season as the Trojans' starting point guard.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JEFF McMILLAN (Forward)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 5, 6-8, 250, junior: McMillan, who transferred from Fordham,
will not be eligible to play at USC until next season. A power
forward and banger down low, McMillan has been helping the Trojans in
practice. He averaged 10.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in two seasons at
Fordham.</TE>
<TE>*--*
JONATHAN OLIVER (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 10, 7-0, 230, junior: Oliver may lack bulk, but with his long
wingspan he is a defensive force and shot-blocking presence. An
athletic big man who likes to run in the transition game, Oliver was
all-state at Ventura College last season after averaging 17.1 points,
11.3 rebounds and 5.2 blocks.</TE>
<TE>*--*
RORY O'NEIL (Center)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 21, 6-11, 240, freshman: The baby-faced O'Neil has added 20
pounds of muscle. With few dominating centers in the Pac-10 this
season, Bibby says much of USC's half-court offense will go through
the technically skilled O'Neil, who has a reliable baseline jumper.</TE>
<TE>*--*
ROY SMILEY (Guard)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   No. 1, 6-4, 195, junior: Smiley initially committed to USC from
Seattle's Garfield High but had to go to junior college first. He can
handle the ball as well as drive and shoot, as evidenced by the three
consecutive three-pointers he knocked down in USC's exhibition
opener. He will get major minutes, either starting or off the bench.</TE>

<LD>USC vs. UCLA</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   at Rose Bowl, Ch. 7</LD>
<TE>   KXTA (1150); KMPC (1540)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's Ryan Killeen and UCLA's Nate Fikse started the season as
backup kickers.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen handled only kickoffs, Fikse kickoffs and punts.
Game-tested teammates were entrusted with field goals and extra
points. But the backups moved to the forefront as first-stringers
faltered, and their performances could be key when seventh-ranked USC
plays No. 25 UCLA on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "My coaches started talking to me about this game a few weeks
ago," said Killeen, who took over as the Trojans' No. 1 kicker when
Pacific 10 Conference play began. "Everyone knows what's at stake.
But when you go out there, you just have to look at it like any other
game."</TE>
<TE>   Killeen, a junior recruited from Mt. San Antonio College to shore
up the Trojans' dismal kickoff deficiencies in 2001, supplanted
senior David Davis on field goals and extra points midway through the
Trojans' third game at Kansas State. He started the next week against
Oregon State and has converted 11 of 16 field-goal attempts and 30 of
32 extra points.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen's missed extra point at Washington State on Oct. 5
prevented the Trojans from taking a four-point lead with 4:10 left.
Washington State tied the score with a field goal that sent the game
into overtime and the Trojans lost, 30-27, when Killeen's 52-yard
field goal try went wide right in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot from that game and it's helped get me ready for
this week," said Killeen, who made seven extra points against
Stanford two weeks ago and kicked two field goals and four extra
points last week against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse, a UCLA senior, backed up former walk-on Chris Griffith for
three years. But after Griffith missed four field-goal attempts, had
two others blocked and also had an extra point blocked in the first
seven games, Fikse replaced him against Stanford on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse kicked field goals of 36, 22, 19, 23 and 44 yards against
the Cardinal, becoming the first UCLA player since Chris Sailer in
1998 to kick five field goals in a game. Fikse kicked two field goals
at Washington and three more at Arizona last week, one a 51-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse has been more consistent than Killeen at kicking the ball
out of the end zone on kickoffs, but both teams struggle when their
kicks are returned. UCLA and USC rank eighth and ninth, respectively,
in the Pac-10 in kickoff-return coverage. The Bruins give up 22.6
yards a return, the Trojans 23.1.</TE>
<TE>   Tab Perry averages 23.8 yards a return for UCLA, Marcell Allmond
18.8 for the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   USC spent extra time addressing its kickoff return coverage this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "That one little aspect could be the aspect that decides the game
in a really tight game, which this one is likely to be," Coach Pete
Carroll said. "That's why we've worked so hard to clean it up and
move some guys around."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams have strong punting games. USC's Tom Malone ranks
second in the Pac-10 at 42.4 per kick. Fikse is third at 41.5.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, USC safety Troy Polamalu blocked a punt by Fikse.</TE>
<TE>   "They put on a great rush, that's the biggest thing," Fikse said.
"Their key players are in there trying to block kicks. Polamalu has
done it less since he hurt his ankle, but he'll probably be back in
there because this is a big game."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Craig Bragg ranks third in the conference in punt returns,
averaging 12.2 yards a return. USC's Greig Carlson averages only 4.8.</TE>
<TE>   "All returners are dangerous," Fikse said. "They put those guys
back there for a reason -- to make plays."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Missionary Killed in Lebanon; 2 Soldiers Hurt in
Kuwait Shooting</HD>
<DH>No motives have yet been determined, but the incidents
underscore the growing dangers facing Americans in Arab nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman and John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>KUWAIT CITY -- Two U.S. soldiers were shot and seriously wounded
Thursday in this tiny nation bordering Iraq and an American
missionary was gunned down in Lebanon, the latest in a spate of
attacks that suggest it has become increasingly dangerous to be
American in the Arab world.</LD>
<LD>   Threats and assaults on U.S. citizens and businesses have become
more frequent in recent weeks, even in countries such as Kuwait and
Jordan that had long been considered among the safest and most
pro-American in the region.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the incidents may be spontaneous, traceable to rising
anti-American sentiment fueled by the possibility of a U.S.-led war
against Iraq, and by what is seen as Washington's unquestioning
support for Israel. But other attacks, observers say, may be part of
an orchestrated campaign by Al Qaeda and its supporters to follow
Osama bin Laden's recent dictate to kill Americans and their allies.</LD>
<TE>   Although authorities here and in Lebanon said it was too soon to
identify a motive in either assault Thursday, the incidents
underscore the reality that Americans were forced to confront on
Sept. 11: that extremists have declared them all fair game.</TE>
<TE>   As security is increased at official U.S. sites, terrorists will
seek "softer" targets, the State Department warned in a worldwide
alert Wednesday. These may include facilities where Americans live or
visit, such as residential neighborhoods, clubs, restaurants, places
of worship, schools, hotels, outdoor events or resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Americans should not draw the false conclusion that everyone
hates their country, said one government spokesman in this oil-rich
emirate that U.S. troops defended 11 years ago after it was invaded
by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no anti-Americanism at all in Kuwait," said Yahqoub
Abdullah of the Kuwaiti Information Ministry. "A bunch of kids is
ruining our relations -- doing illegal things. We in Kuwait
appreciate what you have done for us. These kids doing these things
don't have Kuwaiti hearts -- they are really, really shameful."</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Penner, 31, of Washington state, was the first victim
Thursday. A nurse and Christian missionary, Penner was volunteering
at a clinic for the poor in the biblical Lebanese port city of Sidon.
As she opened the front door about 8:30 a.m., she was shot in the
head three times.</TE>
<TE>   She was found face down in a pool of blood. Nothing was stolen,
and some observers said she could just as well have been targeted for
her religion as for being American because of southern Lebanon's
history of sectarian violence.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Sami Dagher, president of the Christian Missionary Church
Alliance in Lebanon, said Penner had worked in the clinic for a
little more than a year. "Her husband asked me to say: 'My wife died
because she loved the people of Sidon and loved Christ. I forgive
them for killing my wife,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Kuwait, where the government is so jittery about attacks on
Americans they have banned residents from nearly a quarter of the
nation where the U.S. military operates, the two soldiers were shot
by a Kuwaiti traffic police officer who then fled across the border
to Saudi Arabia, authorities here said. Authorities are working to
extradite the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The officer was described as a junior member of the traffic
department. He opened fire about 10:30 a.m. as the soldiers drove
from the U.S. military base of Camp Doha to the town of Arifjan on
official business. The soldiers were dressed in military desert
camouflage and driving a military vehicle, according to a Pentagon
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   One soldier was hit in the face and the other in the shoulder. The
soldiers, who didn't return fire, managed to drive on to Arifjan,
from where they were airlifted to a Kuwaiti military hospital. U.S.
officials did not release the identities of the injured soldiers
pending notification of their families. One of the soldiers is a
reservist based in Lake Charles, La., his wife told Associated Press.
Geraldine Thomas said an Army sergeant told her by phone that her
husband, Larry Thomas, 51, had been shot in the upper chest and was
in serious but stable condition after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon spokesman said their injuries, while serious, did not
appear to be life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The attack on U.S. servicemen in Kuwait -- the third in slightly
more than a month -- is particularly striking because the Pentagon is
relying on the emirate as a launching point for a potential invasion
of Iraq. Nearly 10,000 U.S. troops are believed to be based in
Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   While Washington has largely dismissed the concerns of regional
leaders that they may face trouble controlling public reaction if
there is an invasion of Iraq, these incidents suggest those warnings
may have merit.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, speaking in the Czech
Republic where he was attending a NATO summit, played down the
possibly broader significance Thursday, telling reporters that the
shootings didn't necessarily reflect anger with America's buildup of
troops in Kuwait in anticipation of a new Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been terrorist attacks in that region for my entire
adult lifetime, and that's a long time," the 70-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the shootings have raised alarms over the prospect
of increased terrorist attacks both large and small. Ominously, they
coincide with an audiotape said to be of Bin Laden that was broadcast
this month calling for attacks on the United States and its allies.
U.S. officials have said the tape appears to be authentic and might
foreshadow "spectacular" attacks soon.</TE>
<TE>   The recent round of bloodletting began even before that tape
surfaced. Last month, for the first time in the history of Jordan, a
U.S. diplomat was assassinated. And on Oct. 8, terrorists slipped
onto Kuwait's Faylakah island and opened fire on a contingent of
Marines, killing one and injuring another. The gunmen, who were
killed when other Marines returned fire, later were linked to Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Six days after that, the U.S. military reported that shots were
fired at its troops from two civilian vehicles in Kuwait's northwest.
And then on Nov. 1, shots were fired in the vicinity of U.S. soldiers
training near Arifjan. Officials downplayed the latter incident,
suggesting that hunters fired the shots.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lebanon was notorious for the kidnapping and
assassination of Americans and other Westerners in the 1970s and
'80s, it had become relatively safe turf in recent years, especially
since the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990. Penner's death was
reportedly the first killing of an American in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   But there had been warnings of mounting anti-Western emotions in
recent days. This month, two Pizza Hut franchises were severely
damaged in bomb attacks. No one was injured in either incident, but
the blasts were worrisome enough that the U.S. Embassy in Beirut
issued a fresh warning to U.S. citizens to be vigilant.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef Abdel Moati, a political analyst with the Center of
Research and Studies on Kuwait in Al Mansouriya, said it isn't
surprising that some people have become violent. "Without a doubt,"
he said, "the current situation in Palestine and the unfair stance of
the world community on the issue can be the cause of such attacks."</TE>
<TE>   But he insisted that there was still a divide between those who
hate all Americans and those who hate U.S. government policy. "The
rise is in anger toward certain government foreign policies," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sidon slaying dramatically upped the level of concern for the
safety of foreigners in Lebanon. The U.S. Embassy and the British
Embassy each sent two representatives to the scene to gather
information. Penner's husband, Garry Whitherall, is British.</TE>
<TE>   Her clinic, Unity Center, helped Palestinian refugees living in a
nearby camp and needy local families. But she also wanted to spread
the Christian faith in a city that has a history of sectarian
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Some local observers said that the missionaries had been asked to
leave but refused. Still, they said, that tension had been around for
years, but no one expected it could lead to killing.</TE>
<TE>   "We never had any threats," the Rev. Dagher said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CANBERRA, Australia</DL>
<LD>A conservative Australian politician has sparked outrage with a call
to ban Muslim women from wearing the chador in public because they
could be used to conceal weapons.</LD>
<LD>   In New South Wales' state parliament Wednesday, the Rev. Fred Nile
said the chador was "a perfect disguise for terrorists, as it
conceals both weapons and explosives."</LD>
<LD>   The Christian Democrat politician fueled the furor further today,
telling local television: "It's only extremists who wear the chador."</LD>
<TE>   Nile's proposed ban was instantly condemned by religious leaders,
unions and politicians. Writers to newspapers asked why he had not
extended it to the garb of Catholic nuns.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Seizes Alleged Planner of Bali Bombing</HD>
<DH>The arrest of Imam Samudra, who was also sought in a series
of attacks on churches, is a major breakthrough for the nation's
police force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The alleged organizer of last month's deadly Bali bombing was
arrested Thursday on a public bus as he prepared to board a ferry for
the island of Sumatra, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest in West Java is a major breakthrough for Indonesian
police, who identified suspect Imam Samudra on Sunday as the "field
commander" of the Oct. 12 attack that killed 191 people, mostly
foreign tourists. Seven Americans were among the dead.</LD>
<LD>   Police said today that Samudra had confessed to his involvement in
the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Samudra, 35, who used many aliases and was described as "highly
mobile," was also wanted for his alleged role in a series of other
bombings in Indonesia, including attacks on churches on Christmas Eve
2000 that killed 19 people.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe Samudra could provide crucial information
about Jemaah Islamiah, a regional terror network associated with Al
Qaeda that allegedly is behind a two-year wave of attacks extending
from Bali to Manila to Penang, Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Samudra surrendered without a struggle when police
stopped his bus at 5:30 p.m. just before it boarded the ferry in the
bustling West Java port of Merak, about 600 miles from the bomb site
in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Dai Bachtiar said officers had begun closing in on
Samudra this week when they arrested two of his guards near his
hometown of Serang, about 30 miles from the port. The two men,
identified as Rauf and Yudi, led police to Samudra.</TE>
<TE>   "Three people have been arrested. One of them is Imam Samudra,"
Bachtiar told reporters. "There was no resistance. There was no
weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that both bodyguards were with Samudra on Bali
and were involved in the bombing. Indonesian media reported that Rauf
is a computer expert. They said police tracked Samudra to West Java
by tracing a cell phone number.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Samudra learned how to make bombs in Afghanistan during
the late 1980s or the 1990s. He also spent many years in Malaysia,
including time at an Islamic school in the city of Johor Bahru that
was a meeting point for Indonesian extremists. Among those he would
have encountered there were radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir
and another suspect in the Bali plot, known as Idris.</TE>
<TE>   Police Gen. I Made Mangku Pastika, who is heading the Bali
investigation, said Samudra was the most intellectual of the alleged
plotters and was often seen carrying a laptop computer case. Samudra
remained in Bali for four days after the bombing to monitor police
progress in the investigation, Pastika said.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra, born Abdul Azis, had been wanted in Indonesia since early
last year, when police determined that he had played a central role
in organizing a series of bombings that hit 30 churches in 10 cities
on Christmas Eve 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the Bali bombing might have been prevented if authorities
had pursued him aggressively then. Instead, he was able to roam
freely around Indonesia, including travels to Central Java, where he
reportedly held planning meetings for the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia, which its neighbors have accused of doing too little to
combat terrorism, has stepped up its efforts since the Bali bombing.
Last month, police arrested Bashir, who had been named by terrorist
suspects in custody in other countries as the leader of Jemaah
Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police accuse the 64-year-old cleric of involvement in
the Christmas Eve bombings, the bombing of Indonesia's national
mosque and a plot to assassinate President Megawati Sukarnoputri, but
he has not been tied to the Bali bombing. He denies any part in
terror activities.</TE>
<TE>   Police got their first break in the Bali case when they identified
the chassis number of the minivan used in the bombing and tracked
down its owner, a part-time mechanic and Islamic school teacher named
Amrozi. He gave police details of the plot, including Samudra's role
as the organizer, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Under interrogation, Samudra could provide what police call the
"missing link" that would tie the Bali attack to Bashir and the
Jemaah Islamiah leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the order for the Bali bombing was given
by Riduan Isamuddin, better known as Hambali, an Indonesian cleric
who is alleged to be Jemaah Islamiah's operations chief and a
high-level Al Qaeda member.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali and Bashir were close associates in Malaysia during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Police concluded last year that Hambali and Samudra had worked as
a team to organize the Christmas Eve bombings, traveling around
Indonesia to meet with terrorist cell members and provide them with
money and explosives to carry out the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Police said this week that the Bali suspects could be hiding at
Islamic boarding schools and called on religious leaders to cooperate
in the search.</TE>
<TE>   After the bombing, Samudra apparently traveled by ferry from Bali
to Java, then made his way across the long, narrow island to the port
at Merak.</TE>

<LD>Ukraine's parliament voted in a tough regional governor as its new
prime minister, an ally of President Leonid D. Kuchma who the
president hopes will shore up his support.</LD>
<LD>   Viktor Yanukovich, from eastern Ukraine's coal-producing Donetsk
region, won 234 votes in the 450-seat parliament, despite an
opposition boycott over what it said was his lack of democratic
credentials.</LD>
<LD>   Kuchma is under pressure to step down after Washington alleged he
approved the sale of an aircraft detection system to Iraq in breach
of U.N. sanctions.</LD>

<HD>Bush Gets Backing for Disarming Hussein</HD>
<DH>Leaders at Prague meeting unanimously call on Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- NATO leaders Thursday unanimously called on
Iraq to comply "fully and immediately" with the latest United Nations
resolution, backing President Bush's campaign to disarm Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The 19 North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders pledged to take
"effective action to assist and support the efforts of the U.N." to
ensure Iraqi compliance "without conditions or restrictions" with the
toughened weapons inspection program.</LD>
<LD>   By focusing on the U.N. resolution, the alliance was able to
sidestep whether to support using force against Iraq. Germany in
particular as well as France have opposed the U.S. position favoring
force if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   The NATO statement follows a 15-0 vote by the U.N. Security
Council that ordered arms inspectors back to Iraq to check whether
President Saddam Hussein has nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
Together with a congressional resolution authorizing Bush to wage war
in Iraq, the administration says it has a diplomatic and political
foundation for any conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO leaders' statement was "a signal to Iraq that it doesn't
have any other option, that no one will support Iraq's lack of
compliance or the kind of behavior in which Iraq has been engaged
over the last several years," said White House National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   "The world is united against [Hussein]," she said. .</TE>
<TE>   One senior Bush administration official went further, saying the
statement expresses the thought among NATO's leaders that "diplomacy
has to be backed up by the threat of force."</TE>
<TE>   During the two-day NATO summit, which ends this morning, the
administration also has been exploring with about four dozen
countries their specific military contributions in the event of such
a war.</TE>
<TE>   Rice acknowledged those talks but said little more, simply
characterizing them as an inquiry into "what capabilities might be
necessary if military action is taken."</TE>
<TE>   During a brief appearance with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
the president told reporters: "My expectation is that we can do this
peacefully, if Saddam Hussein disarms. That's my expectation."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who signed the NATO summit statement was German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who remains strongly opposed to war in
Iraq. He and Bush ended their public spat over the matter Wednesday
night during a dinner for the NATO nations' leaders and their
spouses.</TE>
<TE>   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was more open, however, in
repeating his nation's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is completely clear: We will not take part in a
military strike against Iraq," he said while reiterating Germany's
hope that "a catastrophe" can be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials introduced the Iraq statement Tuesday afternoon and
by Wednesday morning it was done, according to one senior
administration official.</TE>
<TE>   "There was very little editing as these things go," he said. "So
there wasn't jockeying for position. People weren't ducking for cover
behind artful phrases. And we were very gratified by that."</TE>
<TE>   Another senior administration official said he was "very
gratified" that Germany came on board "without dragging its claws or
being pushed."</TE>
<TE>   Blair, who has backed Bush's anti-Iraq campaign from the start,
underscored Bush's bottom line of forcing Baghdad to disarm -- one
way or the other.</TE>
<TE>   "What you will find here at this NATO summit is a totally united
determination on behalf of the international community -- reflected
in the unanimous United Nations resolution -- that Saddam Hussein has
to disarm himself of all weapons of mass destruction. And how that
happens is a choice for him," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush travels today to St. Petersburg to meet with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin -- "first and foremost" to personally
reassure him that NATO's expansion eastward -- right up to Russia's
border -- is not a threat to Moscow, in Rice's words.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself added, in a television interview with Russia's NTV,
conducted Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm going to say to the Russian people: You shouldn't fear
expansion of NATO to your border.</TE>
<TE>   "These are peace-loving people. These are freedom-loving people
that are now on your border. You ought to welcome them. It should
help Russian security.... The Cold War is over.... The United States
doesn't view Russia as a threat, and neither does NATO."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bush promised to ensure that Russia's economic
interests in Iraq would be protected in the event of U.S.-sought
"regime change" in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Oil-rich Iraq owes Moscow about $8 billion in Soviet-era debts for
military equipment Baghdad acquired during the Iran-Iraq war in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "And of course we'll be interested in all interests. We have no
desire to run the show, to run the country," Bush said. "And we
understand Russia has got interests there, as do other countries. And
of course those interests will be honored." From St. Petersburg, the
president is scheduled to fly to Vilnius, Lithuania, where he plans
to stay overnight before traveling on to Bucharest, Romania, on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In another interview, with LNK TV of Lithuania, one of NATO's
seven new incoming members, Bush said he had one message to the
people of that nation: "You're free."</TE>
<TE>   Bush added: "I'll also say to the world that the Baltic countries
know what it means to live under fear and the lack of freedom, and to
have these countries be allied with the United States and other
nations is important to our soul. It's important to have that sense
of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important
alliance."</TE>

Self-Rule</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>Three of Northern Ireland's major parties launched negotiations
Thursday designed to restore their Catholic-Protestant administration
of this British territory.</LD>
<LD>   Britain has stripped power from the four-party coalition -- the
key achievement of a 1998 peace pact -- and resumed sole control,
keeping the coalition technically intact for potential revival.</LD>
<LD>   The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, said continuing
Irish Republican Army attacks had undermined Protestant support for
power-sharing with Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party. They called for
the IRA to renounce all forms of violence and continue disarming as
the 1998 deal outlined.</LD>
<TE>   The Ulster Unionists last month threatened to resign from the
administration, triggering its collapse, after police uncovered an
alleged IRA spying operation within government circles. Among four
people charged with possessing stolen documents of use to the IRA was
Sinn Fein's senior administrator at the Stormont Parliamentary
Building, the site of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble skipped Thursday's
negotiations in favor of a political awards ceremony in London. And
leaders of the harder-line Protestant party, the Democratic
Unionists, boycotted the talks on the grounds that they had never
accepted the Good Friday accord of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But both Sinn Fein and its moderate rival for Catholic votes, the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, or SDLP, said the Good Friday pact
included a trove of still-unfulfilled goals that would need to be
assured alongside any IRA moves.</TE>
<TE>   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams came bearing a 2,500-word document
that lauded the IRA's contributions to peacemaking, including its
1997 cease-fire and scrapping of a few weapons dumps in the past
year. It blamed the political breakdown on the Ulster Unionists,
Britain and the SDLP and listed a range of unfulfilled demands,
including an amnesty for IRA figures wanted on often decades-old
warrants.</TE>

<HD>A New Jolt to Israeli Politics</HD>
<DH>Jerusalem's first suicide bombing in months roils an
already unsettled preelection landscape. The nation vows swift
retaliation.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- They had boarded the bus a few minutes earlier: a
seventh-grader on her way to school, an 8-year-old and his
grandmother, a Romanian tourist. Wading among them, a Palestinian man
triggered the explosives strapped to his waist.</LD>
<LD>   Instantly, a typical workaday morning was transformed into a
hellish blast of fire and pain, the first suicide bombing in
Jerusalem in months and one that roiled an already unsettled
political panorama.</LD>
<LD>   Israel vowed swift retaliation for the bombing, which killed 11
passengers and injured dozens of others on bus No. 20 as it pulled
away from a stop on Mexico Street in southern Jerusalem at the height
of Thursday morning's rush hour.</LD>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon summoned his top military commanders
and planned the army's next moves. Sharon, who is embroiled in a
battle for the leadership of his right-wing Likud Party, chose to
exclude his rival in that contest, Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, from the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, and the bomber was identified as a religiously fervent Hamas
supporter from a village near Bethlehem, one of few West Bank cities
not currently controlled by Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, troops and tanks moved back into Bethlehem, as
expected, and were conducting house-to-house searches. The army took
up positions in Manger Square and sealed off the Church of the
Nativity, traditional birthplace of Jesus, to prevent Palestinian
gunmen from seeking refuge there as they did during an offensive in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hamas' claim, the Israeli government blamed Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and accused him of fomenting
terrorism. Arafat's aides condemned the bombing but blamed Sharon and
his "bellicose policies."</TE>
<TE>   "As long as occupation persists, there will be no security or
stability for Zionists," Abdulaziz Rantisi, a senior Hamas official,
said in Gaza City. Hamas' attack belied efforts by the Palestinian
Authority and Egypt to halt such operations inside Israel at least
until after the country's elections in January.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's well-practiced trauma counselors fanned out to schools
and kindergartens in Jerusalem to comfort children, while doctors at
the Abu Kabir forensic institute near Tel Aviv worked through the day
to identify the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the dead were from the southern Jerusalem neighborhood of
Ir Ganim, a couple of blocks from where the bomb exploded. The
neighborhood, whose name means Garden City, is a working-class area
with inexpensive housing, about a quarter of its residents recent
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The dead included Ella Sharshevsky, a recent arrival from Russia,
and her 16-year-old son, Michael, and the grandmother, Kira Pearlman,
and her 8-year-old grandson, Ilan, as well as two 13-year-old girls.
Minutes after the explosion, anguished parents rushed from their
homes above the street where it happened, desperate to find children
they'd just sent off to school.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was the end of the world," passenger David Arouas,
his face bandaged, said later at Hadassah Hospital in suburban Ein
Kerem. "I felt a blow to my head, and I got up and started screaming
for help."</TE>
<TE>   The bus is an enormously popular form of transportation in Israel,
the wheels of choice for students, soldiers, pensioners and new
immigrants -- a cross-section of Israeli society.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came at a time of political upheaval in Israel. After
his coalition government collapsed, Sharon late last month dissolved
parliament and called new elections. Israelis will vote for a prime
minister and parliament Jan. 28, their third national election in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commentators spent much of Thursday debating how the
morning's bombing would hurt or benefit candidates. The conventional
wisdom held that the anger spawned by yet another bombing will harden
voters and push them even further to the right.</TE>
<TE>   Amram Mitzna, the dovish candidate for the opposition Labor Party,
was already facing an uphill struggle, and his standing was not
expected to improve. The real battle is within Likud between Sharon
and Netanyahu.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, a former prime minister, is demanding tougher action
against the Palestinians, including the expulsion of Arafat. Sharon
must woo Likud's hard-line core but is constrained by Washington from
taking draconian actions that would further alienate Arab nations
ahead of a possible U.S. war on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharon-Netanyahu contest has already gotten nasty. This week,
Netanyahu slammed Sharon for having expressed support for the
eventual formation of a Palestinian state. His supporters have placed
billboards saying, "Sharon will bring a terrorist state." Drops of
mock blood drip from the words.</TE>
<TE>   Excluded from the emergency security talks Thursday, Netanyahu
instead paid a high-profile visit to a hospital to speak to
recovering victims. He took several foreign diplomats with him.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to defeat savagery, to defeat terror, is to defeat
it," Netanyahu told the ambassadors, "or it will spread to every one
of your countries, every one of your cities.... We expect not only
your condemnations but your united support in our fight against
terror."</TE>
<TE>   While Netanyahu's hawkish message may appeal to frightened and
outraged Israelis, Sharon thus far appears to be well ahead in
internal Likud polls, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Yisrael Meir Lau, one of the Jewish state's two chief rabbis,
called on politicians to postpone the elections, saying unity over
political divisiveness should be the imperative.</TE>
<TE>   "The public's heart is not in it," he said. "Heightening the
differences, deepening the gaps between right and left, north and
south, religion and state -- this is not the time."</TE>
<TE>   The bomber, meanwhile, was identified as Nael abu Hilayel, a
23-year-old from the West Bank village of Khader, just southwest of
Bethlehem. He came from a stridently religious family, frequently
prayed at the mosque and memorized entire passages of the Koran,
relatives said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces raided one of the family's homes and arrested a
brother and cousin of Hilayel.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were receiving visitors at home in Khader and said
they were proud of their son's act.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God he sacrificed his life for the sake of Palestine," his
tearful mother, Fatima, said.</TE>
<TE>   Hilayel, who worked with his father selling fruits and vegetables,
dropped out of sight Wednesday after telling a sister he wanted to
become a martyr.</TE>
<TE>   Although scores of bombings have killed many Israelis in 26 months
of fighting, Thursday's was the first major attack in Jerusalem in
nearly four months and the first suicide attack here since June 19.</TE>

<HD>Mobs in Nigeria Set Fire to Office, Churches and
Bystanders, Killing 50</HD>
<DH>Rioting is triggered by a newspaper article that suggested
Muhammad would've approved of the Miss World pageant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Angry mobs stabbed and set fire to bystanders Thursday in rioting
that erupted after a newspaper suggested that Islam's founding
prophet would have approved of the Miss World beauty pageant. At
least 50 people were killed and 200 injured, aid officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators in the northern city of Kaduna burned churches
and rampaged through the streets until hundreds of soldiers were
deployed to restore calm and enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of people died. We don't know yet exactly how many.... More
than 50," said Emmanuel Ijewere, president of the Nigerian Red Cross.</LD>
<TE>   Street demonstrations began Wednesday with the burning of an
office of ThisDay newspaper in Kaduna after it published an article
questioning Muslim groups that have condemned the Miss World pageant,
to be held Dec. 7 in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim groups say the pageant promotes sexual promiscuity and
indecency.</TE>
<TE>   "What would Muhammad think? In all honesty, he would probably have
chosen a wife from among" the contestants, Isioma Daniel wrote in
Saturday's article.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper ran a brief front-page apology Monday, followed by a
more lengthy retraction Thursday, saying the offending passage had
run by mistake.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's rioting, more than 50 people were stabbed,
bludgeoned or burned to death and 200 were seriously injured, Ijewere
said. He said at least four churches were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Shehu Sani of the Kaduna-based Civil Rights Congress said he
watched a crowd stab one young man, then force a tire filled with
gasoline around his neck and burn him alive. Sani said he saw three
other bodies elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Alsa Hassan, founder of another human rights group, Alsa Care,
said he saw a commuter being dragged from his car and beaten to
death.</TE>
<TE>   Schools and shops hurriedly closed as hordes of young men,
shouting, "Allahu akbar!" -- "God is great!" -- ignited makeshift
street barricades made of tires and garbage, sending plumes of black
smoke rising above the city. Others were heard chanting, "Down with
beauty" and "Miss World is sin."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of police and soldiers fired tear gas at protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Miss World publicist Stella Din said pageant organizers hoped that
calm would quickly return to Kaduna. "We are very, very sad that it
has come to this -- even if there is a loss of one life, it makes us
sad," she said.</TE>

<HD>U.S., British Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Radar Sites</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.S. and British warplanes bombed two air-defense radar sites in
southern Iraq on Thursday in the latest of a series of strikes in the
"no-fly" zones, the U.S. military said.</LD>
<LD>   The Western warplanes first struck radar near Ash Shuaybah, about
245 miles southeast of Baghdad, then bombed radar near Tallil, about
170 miles southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Central Command said.</LD>
<LD>   Defense officials said the strikes were in retaliation for Iraqi
air defenses attacking U.S. and British planes that patrol the no-fly
zones in southern and northern Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq said the planes were driven off by antiaircraft fire in the
second consecutive day of Western strikes.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News
Agency, claimed that Western planes bombed "civilian and service
installations" in the provinces southeast of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's strikes came after U.S. and British warplanes bombed
three air-defense communications facilities in southern Iraq on
Wednesday in response to reported missile attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq does not recognize the flight exclusion zones set up by
Western powers after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect a Kurdish
enclave in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from attack by
President Saddam Hussein's military.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say that firing at Western patrol jets by Iraqi
defenses is a direct violation of a Nov. 8 U.N. resolution. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has disagreed with that interpretation.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Says Nuclear Pact With U.S. Has Fallen Apart</HD>
<DH>The Foreign Ministry declares the reason is the decision to
suspend fuel oil shipments to the communist country. But the door may
remain open to resume talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea said Thursday that a 1994 nuclear agreement with the
United States has collapsed because of the U.S.-led decision to
suspend fuel oil deliveries to the communist country.</LD>
<LD>   But in a vaguely worded statement, North Korea's Foreign Ministry
appeared to leave open the possibility that the deal might be
salvaged.</LD>
<LD>   It said an earlier appeal for a nonaggression pact with the United
States was aimed at preventing the nuclear agreement from being
derailed.</LD>
<TE>   It said such a pact was the only "realistic solution to the
nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula" and did not say it had plans
to restart a suspected nuclear arms program frozen under the 1994
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the United States and its allies -- South Korea, Japan
and the European Union -- suspended deliveries of fuel oil to the
energy-starved North to punish it for violating the 1994 pact by
embarking on a second nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   The oil deliveries are part of the pact known as the Agreed
Framework that required a U.S.-led consortium to build two modern
nuclear reactors in North Korea. In exchange, the North agreed to
dismantle its suspected plutonium weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   Despite recent revelations that the North has a second nuclear
weapons program based on enriched uranium, an unidentified North
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said the blame for the erosion of
the Agreed Framework lay with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a senior State Department official declined to
comment but noted that North Korean officials took a similar position
when Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly visited Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, last month.</TE>
<TE>   After his trip, Kelly said that North Korean officials told him
they considered the 1994 agreement dead and that they had admitted to
the second nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   The North has offered to resolve U.S. security concerns if
Washington signs a nonaggression treaty with it. But the United
States has ruled out any talks unless the North first scraps its
uranium-based nuclear program.</TE>

<HD>In Close Vote, Pakistan Has New Prime Minister</HD>
<DH>Ending three years of military rule, National Assembly
chooses a strong Musharraf ally. But deep political divisions remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Watson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>KARACHI, Pakistan -- A staunch ally of President Pervez Musharraf and
the military was named prime minister by a narrow margin Thursday,
but more tough political battles lie ahead in Pakistan's deeply
divided National Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assembly elected Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, 68, a
former chief minister of Baluchistan province, ending almost six
weeks of bitter negotiations and three years of military rule. He
immediately made it clear he will follow Musharraf's path.</LD>
<LD>   "My government will continue the policies of the last three years
in which Pakistan has emerged as a front-line state in the war
against terror," he told legislators.</LD>
<TE>   In a veiled warning to India, Jamali said he will maintain
Musharraf's hard line on security issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We want good relations with our neighbors," the new prime
minister said. "Some of our neighbors want good relations, some
don't. But we are able to respond to any aggression. We have
responded in the past and we will continue to respond."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties have accused Musharraf and the military's
powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency of threatening and buying
off politicians to ensure that the new civilian government is led by
allies.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali's party is a breakaway faction of the Pakistan Muslim
League. The PML's leader, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was
overthrown in Musharraf's bloodless coup three years ago. Sharif and
his family were exiled to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali's pro-military, pro-Musharraf faction, the PML-Q, has 117
seats in the 342-seat National Assembly, far short of an outright
victory.</TE>
<TE>   He won the prime minister's post Thursday with the support of
smaller parties and maverick members of exiled former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali polled 172 votes in the National Assembly, giving him a
slight majority that will be hard to maintain as the new government
confronts a long list of problems, including widespread resentment
toward the U.S. search for suspected terrorists in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The country's new prime minister is an avid sportsman, built like
a barrel, who helped from the front office to lead the country's
field hockey team to a gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
He'll need a lot more than deft stickwork to survive the rough and
tumble of Pakistani politics.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech to the nation Wednesday night, Musharraf promised to
hand over power to the new prime minister within two days.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali's shaky coalition government is required to prove its
support in parliament in a confidence vote within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf changed Pakistan's constitution by decree and gave
himself the power to dismiss the prime minister and parliament and
oversee any civilian government with a national security council that
he and other military commanders will dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf seized power in October 1999, and then appointed himself
president, confirming a new five-year term with a referendum in April
of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, the only name on the referendum ballot, claimed 98%
support in the vote, which was widely dismissed as a farce.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition has accused him of violating the constitution by
holding on to military power as the armed forces' commanding general
while serving as a civilian head of state.</TE>
<TE>   "If Pervez Musharraf is serious in handing over power to the
elected representatives, then he should announce his retirement from
the post of army chief and withdraw all the unilateral amendments he
made in the constitution," said Qazi Hussein Ahmed, leader of an
alliance of six Islamic parties.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance, called the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal, or United
Council of Action, held the balance of power after none of Pakistan's
political parties won a majority in October's national elections. The
mullahs formed the third-largest bloc with 60 of the National
Assembly's 342 seats. They won strong support in several regions with
an anti-U.S. campaign and then persuaded mainstream opposition
parties to support hard-line cleric Maulana Fazlur Rehman for the
prime minister's post.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman is barred from visiting the U.S. because of his
anti-American and pro-Taliban rhetoric. When the hard bargaining for
a coalition government began, he offered a more pragmatic approach to
foreign policy if elected prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   But when Bhutto's party appeared close to forming a coalition
government with the Islamic alliance, with Rehman as prime minister,
Musharraf postponed the vote in parliament. The opposition called it
a ploy to give his allies more time to build a winning coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Ten dissident members of Bhutto's party threw their support behind
the pro-Musharraf bloc, claiming they wanted to ensure political
stability. Bhutto's PPP accused the members of bowing to pressure
from Musharraf's allies, and is threatening to expel them from the
party.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman's Muslim alliance accused Musharraf of letting the U.S.
meddle in Pakistani affairs. "By allowing the United States to set up
its bases and allowing the FBI to conduct raids on Pakistani soil,
President Musharraf has sold the independence of the country," said
Qazi Hussain Ahmed, another leader of the Islamic coalition.</TE>

<CX>   Pakistani medal -- A story in Section A on Friday referred
incorrectly to the Olympic Games at which Pakistan's field hockey
team won a gold medal with the front-office assistance of Mir
Zafarullah Khan Jamali, the country's new prime minister. It was the
1984 Los Angeles Olympics, not the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.</CX>

<HD>Earthquake in Himalayan Pakistan Kills at Least 25</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An earthquake rattled a remote mountainous region of northern
Pakistan before dawn Thursday, killing at least 25 people, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The temblor hit the Gilgit region, about 240 miles northeast of
Peshawar, said Jehangir Khan, an official with the Ministry of
Kashmiri Affairs in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Aftershocks
rumbled for hours.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's Meteorological Department said the quake's magnitude
was 5.5. The U.S. Geologic Survey in Golden, Colo., said the
earthquake measured 5.8, and put the epicenter about 30 miles
south-southeast of Gilgit, in the Himalayan foothills.</LD>
<TE>   Khan said people fled from crumbling homes in the hardest-hit
villages: Turbelin, Mushkin, Dashkin and Harchu. Those locations have
a combined population of more than 6,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We are expecting the casualties may rise," Khan said. "We do not
have a number for the injured."</TE>

<HD>More Tanker Oil Hits Shore</HD>
<DH>Fishing ban is extended along Spanish coast in aftermath of
spill. Officials still hope heavy fuel will solidify on the cold
ocean floor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NOIA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Waves of black sludge from a major oil spill washed ashore amid heavy
winds and driving rain Thursday, tarring new stretches of
northwestern Spain's scenic coastline and further threatening the
region's multimillion-dollar fishing industry.</LD>
<LD>   The regional government extended a ban on fishing and shellfish
harvesting declared Saturday, when heavy fuel oil from the tanker
Prestige first reached land. The ban now covers more than 186 miles
of Galician coastline from El Ferrol south to Ribeiro.</LD>
<LD>   More than 10,000 tons of fuel oil leaked from the Bahamian-flagged
tanker in several spills starting Nov. 13, when its hull cracked in a
storm.</LD>
<TE>   The ship broke in half and sank Tuesday about 150 miles off Cape
Finisterre, carrying most of its 77,000-ton cargo to the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   Officials and environmentalists remained hopeful the oil that sank
with the Prestige would solidify in the frigid cold and high pressure
more than two miles down on the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   No plans have been announced to try to recover the oil, valued at
$10 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, fishermen harvested mussels, oysters and other
commercially valuable shellfish ahead of schedule from estuary beds
that risked contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities deployed more oil-blocking barriers outside ports and
rivers open to the ocean. Soldiers in protective gear joined
environmentalists and volunteers in shoveling toxic oil from beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing and canning is a major industry here, generating about
$330 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's environmental minister has estimated economic damage and
cleanup costs at $42 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   The miles of oil barriers deployed in recent days were ineffective
against rough Atlantic seas, and the government lacks other resources
-- such as oil-skimming ships -- to control the spill effectively.
Neighboring countries were sending cleanup vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Some sea gulls, cormorants and other birds were dead. Others
caught in the spill flapped away from volunteers trying to rescue
them. At least several hundred animals have died, according to the
government and environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   Although strong winds and 26-foot waves dispersed some floating
oil in recent days, four slicks detected offshore were heading toward
land. Residents fear more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige's cargo was more than twice the amount of crude oil
spilled off Alaska by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.</TE>

<HD>Hong Kong Billionaire Nina Wang May Lose It All</HD>
<DH>Court finds that a 1990 will of her husband is a forgery.
He was abducted and later declared dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>HONG KONG -- Local heiress Nina Wang, known as Asia's richest woman,
was on the verge of losing her fortune Thursday after a judge ruled
that a will leaving her most of her late husband's estate was a
forgery.</LD>
<LD>   Pending any appeal, the decision means that the estate of Hong
Kong business tycoon Teddy Wang, estimated at well over $2 billion,
passes to the man who challenged the will's validity, Wang's
90-year-old father-in-law. Wang was also ordered to pay 85% of his
legal costs.</LD>
<LD>   For a case that ran more than a year and consumed 171 court days,
legal bills were estimated to run into millions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling against the eccentric 65-year-old widow, who likes to
wear pigtails and miniskirts and prefers to be called "Little
Sweetie," followed a lurid courtroom battle laced with tales of
adultery, greed, deceit and bitter family feuding. In a culture where
money is revered and the rich guard their privacy, even minor
courtroom details frequently became the stuff of headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Teddy Wang was kidnapped in 1990 and was never seen alive again.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict left Nina Wang facing an uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking through the law firm that handled her case, Wang rejected
the court's findings and indicated that the legal fight was far from
over.</TE>
<TE>   "We have spoken with our client, and there will be an appeal,"
said Jennifer Milford, director of marketing and business development
at the firm of Johnson Stokes &amp; Master. "The judgment is a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Wang's father-in-law, Wang Din-shin, failed to return
telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   If an appeal succeeds, Nina Wang could conceivably regain control
over the family fortune, which includes the large property
development company Chinachem. Earlier this year, Forbes magazine put
her net worth at $2.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But Wang's troubles could also get much worse.</TE>
<TE>   Circumstances surrounding Thursday's ruling leave open the
possibility that she could face criminal charges in connection with
the will that has been declared a forgery. That will, allegedly
written just a month before Teddy Wang vanished in April 1990, gave
the businessman's entire estate to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   It also reversed a 1968 will that was written after he suspected
her of having an affair with another man. That document disinherited
Nina Wang.</TE>
<TE>   Among the developments that placed Wang under suspicion was
evidence presented in court that she liked to practice her husband's
signature and was allegedly proud of how well she could imitate it.
The 558-page judgment written by High Court Judge David Yam declared
in part: "I have no doubt that the questioned signatures ... are
forged signatures."</TE>
<TE>   Wang was fond of describing her courtship with and marriage to
Teddy in 1955 as a fairy-tale love affair that only grew stronger
over the years, but many -- including her father-in-law -- questioned
that version. After Teddy's disappearance, she ran the family
business empire through a power of attorney and, by most accounts,
did well.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, she unveiled ambitious plans to build the
world's tallest building -- 108 stories -- in Hong Kong, but
government authorities rejected the project as an aviation hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the passage of years, she refused to accept the
possibility that her husband had been killed by his kidnappers. After
a prolonged effort, however, her father-in-law managed to get Teddy
Wang declared legally dead in 1999. That step seemed destined to give
Wang Din-shin control over the family fortune -- until Little Sweetie
produced the will declared a forgery Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Schroeder Have 'Cordial' Exchange</HD>
<DH>Leaders meet after falling-out over German's Iraq stand.</DH>

<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- The suspense is over.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder have made
up.</LD>
<LD>   Before sitting down to a swanky dinner for NATO leaders here
Wednesday night, the men smiled, shook hands and briefly exchanged
pleasantries.</LD>
<TE>   "Germany is an important friend of the United States. And we've
got a relationship to maintain, and we will maintain it," Bush the
pragmatist explained Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-Schroeder falling-out stemmed from the chancellor's
reelection campaign, during which he strongly opposed a war in Iraq.
Bush was further angered when one of Schroeder's ministers was quoted
as comparing the U.S. president's tactics to those of Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   After Schroeder eked out a victory in the September election, Bush
snubbed him by not placing the traditional congratulatory phone call
to him. He also ignored a letter from Schroeder. The leaders finally
had a short phone conversation Nov. 8.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't meet face to face until Wednesday night at Prague
Castle.</TE>
<TE>   "They shook hands last night," the president's national security
advisor, Condoleezza Rice, reported Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The president described it to everyone as a cordial discussion.
And the work of U.S.-German relations goes on and will continue to go
on. It's an important relationship," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schroeder hasn't softened in his opposition to war in Iraq
-- even though he signed on to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
leaders' statement Thursday calling on Baghdad to "fully and
immediately" comply with the latest U.N. resolution and rid itself of
suspected weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<HD>Corruption Arrests in Carson</HD>
<DH>Four present and former City Council members are accused of
extorting bribes. Federal indictments allege widespread abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Rohrlich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal agents unveiled evidence Thursday of widespread corruption in
Carson, charging four present and former City Council members with
extorting bribes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars from waste
haulers and other firms seeking municipal business.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors portrayed a majority voting bloc on the five-member
City Council as corrupt, more interested in lining its own pockets
than in shopping for high-quality public services at the best price.
All, along with two middlemen and three waste-hauling executives also
charged in the case, face the possibility of 10 years in prison if
convicted.</LD>
<LD>   Carson City Councilman and Mayor Daryl Sweeney and former Mayor
Pete Fajardo were arrested and charged with extorting money from
businesses over the last three years.</LD>
<TE>   Charged with related crimes were City Councilwoman Raunda Frank
and former City Councilman Manny Ontal. Until Ontal resigned his seat
in April, he, Frank and Sweeney constituted the council majority that
prosecutors allege was for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeknown to his colleagues, Ontal was working as an undercover
operative for federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   He had walked into the U.S. attorney's office in Santa Ana with a
lawyer in September 2000 and proclaimed that he was tired of the
corruption, said the lead prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S.
Atty. John Hueston. Ontal confessed his own corrupt acts, Hueston
said, and agreed to expose others. Ontal then secretly taped
conversations relating to the award of a lucrative waste-hauling
contract. Ontal has agreed to plead guilty to accepting an earlier,
unrelated $5,000 bribe.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, 45, the part-time mayor who serves as chief of staff for
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry, was portrayed in a grand
jury indictment as the ringleader. He told Ontal on tape, prosecutors
said, that he saw the award of the multiyear garbage contract as a
"long-term opportunity" for council members to collect six-figure
supplements to their incomes.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he looked to other city contracts for future payoffs.
Seeking to assure Ontal that each of the conspirators would get his
fair share, Sweeney said: "I think there are enough things coming
down the pike where, if all of them pop, everybody's going to be
set," prosecutors related in court filings.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's lawyer, John Sweeney, a distant relative, said, "The
allegations in the indictment are shocking, and they are untrue."</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's employer, Perry, is "neither a subject nor a target" of
what lead prosecutor Hueston described as a continuing, wide-ranging
investigation into possible corruption in other cities. Perry said
Sweeney was put on unpaid leave after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's personal lawyer, Robert Dennis Pryce Jr., 52, of
Tarzana, was charged with helping to arrange some of the bribes. His
lawyer, Michael Proctor, said Thursday that Pryce looked forward to
telling his side of the story and expects to be exonerated.</TE>
<TE>   Former Inglewood city councilman and former Los Angeles Police
Officer Garland Hardeman, 46, was charged with attempting to arrange
bribes for the accused Carson council members. He has agreed to plead
guilty, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce and Hardeman offered their services to waste-hauling firms
as consultants who could help them secure city contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management, the country's largest waste hauler, refused to
retain either man and lost out, although, the government said, it was
low bidder for a 10-year contract, worth tens of millions of dollars,
to haul commercial waste.</TE>
<TE>   Two executives with Browning Ferris Industries, a subsidiary of
the nation's second-largest waste hauler, Allied Waste Industries,
were charged with agreeing to pay nearly $600,000 in bribes through
Pryce late last year.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Sweeney, Frank and Ontal voted earlier this year to
award BFI the contract, although the firm submitted the high bid,
prosecutors said. BFI later fired the executives who allegedly agreed
to the bribe, and was not charged. U.S. Atty. Debra Yang said that is
because the firm has cooperated with federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Aloyan, president of a relatively small competitor,
Compton-based Hub City Solid Waste, offered to pay the largest bribe
in the case -- $1.5 million to Ontal, prosecutors said. Aloyan, who
later made a token payment of $10,000, court documents show, has
agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Lead prosecutor Hueston said Aloyan "is attempting to cooperate"
by providing information "beyond the Carson schemes." Hueston refused
to be more specific. Aloyan was an admitted middleman in a separate
bribery scandal involving former Compton officials a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, The Times reported claims by Waste Management
and another firm, CalMet Services, that Aloyan had promised to
deliver them a lucrative Compton city garbage contract if the firms
paid him $1 million. After they refused, the Compton City Council
awarded the contract to Aloyan.</TE>
<TE>   The Times also reported claims by Waste Management that Carson
Mayor Sweeney had referred the firm to Pryce when it sought to renew
its garbage contract. Pryce allegedly asked for $1 million at one
point to help deliver City Council approval, Waste Management told
the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, prosecutors also alleged that:</TE>
<TE>   * Former Carson Mayor Fajardo, 60, who left office last year,
offered to guarantee the award of a $700,000 engineering contract in
1999 in return for a $70,000 bribe, which was not paid. The job then
went to another firm. Hueston would not say whether that firm had
paid.</TE>
<TE>   Fajardo also was charged with accepting $50,000 in bribes from the
owner of a senior citizens apartment complex. In return, Fajardo
allegedly helped the owner, Michael Padilla, obtain an $850,000 city
grant. Padilla, who was not charged, is regarded as a victim,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   * Sweeney's lawyer, Pryce, abused an unrelated position as one of
45 U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustees in the Central District of
California. He allegedly used his position to collect kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   As a trustee, Pryce was the court's designee to control debtors'
financial affairs. He allegedly agreed to use Nelson Shelton and
Associates as his real estate agent to sell debtors' properties. The
firm hired Pryce's daughter, public school teacher Kelly Walecki, and
paid her half its sales commission. She did nothing to earn the
money, and over time, prosecutors said, the Shelton firm paid Walecki
$310,000. She returned more than $130,000 to her father. Neither the
Shelton firm, which prosecutors view as a victim, nor Walecki were
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce also was charged with negotiating a kickback from a
construction firm, Scorza and Sons, for repairs on properties owned
by debtors. Prosecutors said Scorza was paid about $1.3 million for
repairs on two properties and returned about $170,000 to Pryce in
cash. The firm was not charged.</TE>
<TE>   The Central District's chief trustee, Maureen A. Tighe, said in a
statement: "This is the first time a bankruptcy trustee has been
indicted in this district, and the allegations in the indictment, if
proven, would constitute one of the most egregious frauds committed
on the bankruptcy system in this district's history."</TE>
<TE>   * Former Councilman Ontal told prosecutors that he accepted his
$5,000 bribe in 2000 in exchange for making a motion to extend a
public bus service contract held by Transportation Concepts. The
company was not charged. Prosecutors said they had insufficient
evidence -- only Ontal's uncorroborated account. Ontal also agreed to
plead guilty to evading taxes on $33,000 in unreported income.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Frank, a deputy Los Angeles County public defender,
has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion and
cooperate with the government, according to court papers filed
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, Pryce, Fajardo and former BFI executive Douglas Allyn
Moore were arrested at their homes Thursday morning, and arraigned in
the afternoon at the federal courthouse downtown. The other former
BFI executive, David Duan Robinson, turned himself in Thursday. His
lawyer, Michael Nasatir, said Robinson is "innocent of these
charges."</TE>
<TE>   All but Fajardo posted bail and were freed, prosecutors said.
Calls to lawyers representing Fajardo and Moore were not returned
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, led by FBI Agent Craig Howland and IRS criminal
investigator Steve Berryman, carries a lesson for businesspeople and
politicians, U.S. Atty. Yang said at a news conference: "Money does
not buy you access. Money buys you a criminal indictment."</TE>
<TE>   The probe picked up steam last year as a six-year garbage-hauling
contract, valued at $36 million and held by Waste Management, neared
expiration.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management sought to negotiate a contract renewal without
having to compete against other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who offered help was Hardeman, the former Inglewood
councilman. Hardeman asked Waste Management for $1.8 million if he
succeeded in getting its contract renewed, prosecutors said. The
charges against Hardeman, who is cooperating with the government, say
he planned to share the money with any council members who asked;
Sweeney and Ontal allegedly asked.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management ultimately did not employ Hardeman. But at one
point, Hardeman believed that Waste Management would pay him
$250,000, officials say. He offered $50,000 apiece to Sweeney and
Ontal, but Sweeney told him that was not enough, prosecutors said. "I
need all of that [$250,000]," prosecutors allege Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney later told Ontal that he was unhappy with Hardeman, saying
that he "would rather have somebody in place ... that I can trust and
that is used to dealing ... with big, big, big dollars," according to
a federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's lawyer, Pryce, wrote Waste Management, offering his
services as a lobbyist for $300,000 in advance and $300,000 upon
council approval of the contract extension, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Waste Management then met with Sweeney and was
told that if Waste Management paid Pryce, it would get the council
votes it needed, the government charged.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management rejected Sweeney's alleged offer, but Pryce tried
again. In August 2001, prosecutors said, Pryce told Sweeney that
Waste Management seemed willing to pay $25,000 per month over three
years. Pryce was wrong, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management again refused, and the City Council requested
bids from all interested garbage haulers.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, Sweeney named himself and Ontal to evaluate the
bids, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce drew interest from executives at Browning Ferris Industries,
prosecutors said. Pryce allegedly told Ontal that BFI would pay
$585,000: $45,000 in advance and $15,000 a month for three years.</TE>
<TE>   But Sweeney had a problem. He and Ontal had narrowed the field to
four firms. BFI was the highest bidder, Waste Management, the lowest.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney observed that BFI would have to reduce its bid and Pryce
then faxed BFI details of Waste Management's confidential bid,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce's fax was sent to an uninvolved city worker, apparently by
mistake. The worker circulated it, raising suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce allegedly told confederates later in the winter that he gave
Sweeney and Ontal $10,000 each, and Frank $5,000. Pryce met Ontal at
a hotel, handed him a newspaper and told him, "There's an article
inside you need to read," according to an indictment. Inside were two
envelopes stuffed with cash.</TE>
<TE>   Hardeman, the Inglewood consultant, continued to labor on behalf
of another waste-hauler finalist, Vernon-based Klistoff and Sons.
Hardeman offered Ontal at least $30,000 if he voted to give Klistoff
part of the commercial contract. Prosecutors said it was not clear
that Klistoff knew of Hardeman's offer. Klistoff was not charged.</TE>
<TE>   Ontal, Sweeney and Frank voted in February to award BFI the city's
commercial hauling contract for 10 years. BFI then started making its
monthly payments of $15,000, court documents allege.</TE>

<HD>Drunk Driving Deaths in U.S. Rose in 2001, MADD Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of drunk driving deaths in the United States rose last
year after holding steady during most of the 1990s, Mothers Against
Drunk Driving said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   There were 17,448 drunk driving deaths in 2001, up from 16,572 in
1999, the last time MADD conducted its "Rating the States" survey.
The organization graded the nation with a C -- down from a C-plus in
1999 -- with California ranking the highest with a B-plus, and
Montana flunking.</LD>
<LD>   MADD President Wendy Hamilton blamed the increase on complacency.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got about 300 people getting killed every single week in
this country in completely preventable crashes," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, alcohol-related traffic deaths dropped by 40% from
1980, when MADD was formed, to 1993. The number of deaths hovered
around 16,500 from 1994 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The war on drunk driving stalled," Hamilton said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The grades are based on the number of alcohol-related crashes in
each state, trends in the number of deaths, state laws on the books
and enforcement efforts.</TE>
<TE>   After California, other states that got high marks include
Georgia, New York, North Carolina and Oregon, which all received B
grades.</TE>
<TE>   Montana was the only state to flunk. Hamilton said it was the
first time a state received an F since the group began rankings a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   She called Montana "abysmal," noting the number of alcohol-related
crashes in the state, its failure to set 0.08% as the legal
blood-alcohol limit and a lack of support for making failure to wear
a seat belt a primary traffic violation.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 104 of Montana's 230 traffic deaths came in
alcohol-related crashes, MADD said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Galt, director of the Montana Department of Transportation,
said that he is concerned about that number but that the state is
working to lower it.</TE>
<TE>   Galt said he expects the Legislature will consider lowering the
blood-alcohol level from 0.1% next year and imposing a statewide ban
on open containers of alcohol in vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not proud of being 'F,' " Galt said. "I take that very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Galt said he disagreed with how the report described the state's
efforts to fight drunk driving, pointing to state funding of efforts
to reduce underage drinking and to set up visible sobriety
checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Montana was joined at the bottom of the list by Alaska and
Massachusetts, which received D-minus grades, and North Dakota, Rhode
Island, South Dakota and South Carolina, which received Ds.</TE>
<TE>   MADD's recommendations to reduce fatalities include more and
well-publicized sobriety checkpoints. It also urged tougher penalties
against drivers who refuse alcohol tests, who are caught driving with
a license that was suspended for an earlier drunk driving arrest or
who have a blood-alcohol level of 0.15% or more.</TE>
<TE>   One group, the Governors Highway Safety Assn., criticized the MADD
report, saying states should be judged on how they measure up against
their own goals rather than against each other.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cannot Find Many Resident Aliens, Investigation Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government could not locate nearly half the 4,112 resident aliens
whom authorities wanted to talk to after the Sept. 11 attacks,
congressional investigators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service did not have the
current addresses of 1,851 people, according to the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The INS either failed to tell those people that they had to alert
the agency when they moved or did not enforce the requirement.</LD>
<TE>   The report is the latest in a string of post-Sept. 11 criticism
aimed at the INS, which will be abolished when its functions are
transferred to the new Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This finding should not be shocking to anyone," said Rep. John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee. "The better use of technology, along with a better public
information campaign, could go a long way toward solving this
problem. Congress must continue its very close scrutiny to ensure
that the immigration system serves the needs of both immigrants and
the law enforcement community."</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, the INS has sought ways to better track foreign
visitors. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers entered the United
States legally on travel visas. Three were admitted with business
visas. The 19th entered on a student visa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of the agency being overwhelmed," said Steven
Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a
nonpartisan research group that supports some limits on immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners arriving in the United States for extended stays must
report their address to the government. The list includes permanent
residents who are not citizens. They are supposed to let the INS know
within 10 days of a move, but many may not know this because the
agency does not publicize the requirement, the GAO said. Others
simply ignore the rules because the agency has not enforced the
regulation for almost three decades, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's equivalent to not returning a library book on time," said
Angela Kelley, deputy director of the National Immigration Forum, a
pro-immigration group. "It's something that most perfectly legal
immigrants know nothing about. You have to question whether this is
where the INS should put its enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft proposed rules in July to help the INS
begin enforcing the law. The subsequent deluge of change-of-address
forms overwhelmed the INS' ability to update its records, agency
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials said they received 500,000 forms and hired a private
contractor to help them update their records. They said they hoped to
eliminate the backlog by mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   In a written response to the GAO report, Robert Diegelman, acting
assistant attorney general for the administration, agreed with most
of the report's findings but said U.S. attorneys' offices did not
have the time to prosecute minor offenses such as failing to file
change of address forms. The maximum penalty is 30 days in jail and a
$200 fine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If enforcement of the requirement to file a notice of change of
address is to be effective, these penalties would need to be
substantially increased," Diegelman wrote. "Only then will a change
in operating procedures and referring cases to the United States
attorneys be effective."</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Sues Train's Manufacturer Over Design Flaws</HD>
<DH>Railroad says delays are slowing introduction of high-speed
rail. But company shifts blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amtrak is suing the manufacturer of its high-speed Acela Express
train, escalating a year-old legal battle over design flaws that have
slowed America's first attempt at high-speed rail.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak is seeking more than $200 million in damages from
Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Alstom Ltd. of France for what it calls
"extraordinary delays and pervasive failures" in carrying out the
contract to build 20 of the sleek trains.</LD>
<LD>   Bombardier launched the court battle in November 2001 by suing
Amtrak for $200 million. Its lawsuit is pending before U.S. District
Judge Richard J. Leon, who in September turned down Amtrak's request
to dismiss the case. The railroad is appealing that decision.</LD>
<TE>   Bombardier said Amtrak did not sufficiently upgrade tracks in the
Northeast to prepare for the new trains, provided inaccurate
information about tunnels and tracks and imposed "costly and
time-consuming new design requirements" that, among other things,
made the trains too heavy for high-speed service. Alstom did not join
Bombardier's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In Amtrak's countersuit, filed Wednesday, the national passenger
railroad says it is the victim of mismanagement by Bombardier and
Alstom. It says Acela Express trains were not delivered on schedule
and are not performing up to par in the Boston-New York-Washington
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak says that Bombardier, by filing its lawsuit last year,
violated a contract provision requiring attempts to settle disputes
out of court. Bombardier's decision to go to court left Amtrak with
no choice but to do the same, Amtrak President David Gunn said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We incurred substantial financial losses because of these
problems and must unfortunately pursue through the legal system what
the manufacturer has been unwilling to abide by in the contract,"
Gunn said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Bombardier said the Montreal-based builder tried
several times to resolve the case by mediation or arbitration, but
Amtrak resisted.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the filing of Amtrak's long-awaited counterclaim,"
said spokeswoman Carol Sharpe. "It's a necessary step toward
resolution of the dispute."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Alstom declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bombardier and Alstom teamed up to win the $800-million Acela
Express contract in 1996. The contract called for construction of 20
of the high-speed trains, plus 15 high-horsepower locomotives to pull
conventional trains and three maintenance facilities. Bombardier is
required under the contract to maintain and repair the trains for 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak hoped to introduce Acela Express in October 1999. It
projected that the trains, capable of reaching speeds of 150 mph,
would generate $180 million in profit each year.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of delays, the inaugural Acela Express train
entered service in December 2000. There were further delays in
production of the rest of the trains. Amtrak has received 19 of them
but says they all need to be rotated out of service for numerous
improvements and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the entire fleet was sidelined when cracks were
discovered on and near brackets holding shock-absorbing assemblies to
Acela Express locomotives. So far, Amtrak has returned 12 to daily
duty, with three in reserve. On a typical day before the problem, 15
Acela locomotives were running in Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe said Bombardier has designed an improved bracket to fix the
problem. Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said the railroad is working
with the Federal Railroad Administration to evaluate the proposed
fix.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak has told Congress it needs $1.2 billion to maintain service
for the current budget year.</TE>

<HD>Water Disease Outbreaks on the Rise</HD>
<DH>Insufficient rules on private wells cited in illnesses
involving pools and drinking water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Outbreaks of disease from drinking water and swimming pools have
dramatically risen in recent years despite improvements in publicly
operated water systems, the government said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   One of the chief causes includes insufficient regulation of
private wells, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of these drinking- water outbreaks are preventable," said
Sherline Lee of the CDC.</LD>
<TE>   "Whether from the tap or a bottle, the public should think about
where their water comes from and whether it has been made safe."</TE>
<TE>   About 70% of the outbreaks traced to swimming pools involved the
chlorine-resistant organism cryptosporidium, the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   Germs found in wells and other sources of drinking water can
include parasites such as giardia and cryptosporidium and bacteria
such as E. coli and salmonella.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 and 2000, the latest years for which data are available,
there were 39 outbreaks involving drinking water in 25 states, the
CDC reported. That is more than double the 17 reported in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp rise comes even as outbreaks in regulated public water
systems decline, and indicates that owners of private wells must
"make sure the well is properly constructed, maintained or tested,"
Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rise in outbreaks, the number of people sickened
remained steady. A total of 2,038 people were made ill by drinking
water outbreaks in 1997-98, compared with 2,027 in 1999-2000. Two
people died and 122 were hospitalized in drinking-water outbreaks in
1999 and 2000, the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999-2000, nearly 2,100 people in 23 states were sickened in 59
outbreaks involving swimming pools and other recreational sources,
such as hot springs and lakes. Four died and 25 were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997-98, there were 32 outbreaks involving pools and other
recreational sources that sickened 2,128 in 18 states.</TE>

<HD>Senators Remembered to Deliver for Folks at Home</HD>
<DH>Aside from the hot national issues of the day, lawmakers
cleared some local concerns, like weed control and a shooting range.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sure, they made headlines by approving President Bush's Department of
Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   But before senators brought down the curtain on the 107th
Congress, they also enacted the Noxious Weed Control Act of 2002.
They voted to establish institutes to study wildfire prevention in
the West. And they approved a measure turning over 2,880 acres of
federal land for a public shooting range on the outskirts of Las
Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   While other issues drew more public attention, it was the more
mundane topics -- those important to the folks back home and to
politicians' self-preservation -- that occupied the final hours of
the 2002 legislative session.</LD>
<TE>   "All politics really is local," said Don Kettl, a University of
Wisconsin political scientist, recalling a political adage most
memorably articulated by the late House Speaker Thomas P. "Tip"
O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers need to deliver for their constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "Few members can credibly go back to their constituents and say,
'I created the new homeland security agency,' " said Philip A.
Klinkner, an associate professor of government at Hamilton College in
Clinton, N.Y. "On the other hand, they can go back and plausibly
claim, 'This new shooting range is because of my skill and leadership
on Capitol Hill.' "</TE>
<TE>   Don Ritchie, the Senate's associate historian, recalled that past
chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee "always seemed vulnerable
when they ran for reelection because the voters cared less about what
they did for the world than what they did back home."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) was so determined to win passage
of a water bill that she threw out her original 22-page measure and
drafted a mere two paragraphs that were designed to overcome
Republican opposition.</TE>
<TE>   She succeeded, sort of. The measure, which would renew the
California Federal Bay-Delta Program to restore the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, the state's major watershed, passed the Senate, but
probably too late for the House to take up the measure.</TE>
<TE>   This bill, like a lot of measures that cleared the Senate in the
final hours, gave its sponsor little more than bragging rights,
though Feinstein called the water bill a "modest step forward" that
will "generate momentum for further action next year."</TE>
<TE>   In the early morning hours Wednesday, the Senate passed more than
100 bills, about 40 of which already had cleared the House and now go
to the president for his signature.</TE>
<TE>   They included the shooting range bill, necessary to eliminate the
danger of makeshift target practice areas popping up near homes and
communities, said a spokesman for one of the bill's sponsors, Sen.
Harry Reid (D-Nev.). To ensure the bill's passage, Reid stayed in the
Senate chamber after most of his colleagues had gone to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Also sent to the president was a bill to establish a commission to
study reparations for the people of Guam who suffered under the
Japanese occupation of the U.S. territory during World War II. The
panel would make recommendations to Congress, which would decide how
much money should be paid out, if any.</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation is enormously significant for the people of
Guam," said Robert A. Underwood, Guam's delegate to Congress. "As the
only American community to experience an enemy occupation in the 20th
century, there has not been adequate recognition of this experience
and no serious attempt to provide for compensation."</TE>
<TE>   There were even bills that dealt with matters far outside their
sponsors' districts. Among those was one authorizing up to $50
million to protect Civil War battlefields. Rep. Gary G. Miller
(R-Diamond Bar) introduced the measure after visiting the site of the
Battle of Memphis, in Tennessee. "All I saw was a historic plaque and
condominiums," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other Senate-passed bills need the approval of the
House, making it unlikely that they will win final approval this
year. Among those were bills creating wildfire research institutes
and establishing a more coordinated program to eradicate weeds.</TE>
<TE>   The House today is expected to meet -- with just a few members
present in a session lasting just a few minutes -- to approve
noncontroversial Senate changes in the homeland security legislation
before closing the 107th Congress.</TE>
<TE>   For those bills that fail to clear Congress this year, sponsors
will need to reintroduce the bills when the new Congress convenes
Jan. 7.</TE>

<LD>The state Supreme Court rejected prosecutors' requests for life
imprisonment of a man who served as a lookout during a double murder
when he was 15.</LD>
<LD>   Leon Miller, 20, agreed on the spur of the moment in 1997 to stand
watch while Chicago gang members killed two members of a rival group.
He was tried as an adult and convicted of murder.</LD>
<LD>   The law required an automatic life sentence, but the trial judge
gave Miller 50 years, citing a constitutional amendment that says
punishment must match the severity of the crime.</LD>

<LD>An automatic recount was triggered in the race for Colorado's new
congressional seat after new vote tallies showed Republican Bob
Beauprez ahead of Democrat Mike Feeley by 122 votes out of nearly
163,000 cast.</LD>
<LD>   Beauprez had led by 386 votes, but three counties were ordered by
a judge to count every qualified provisional ballot in the battle to
represent the 7th District in suburban Denver.</LD>
<LD>   When the returns came in, Beauprez had 81,530 votes to Feeley's
81,408. The margin is so small that a recount is automatic under
state law.</LD>

<HD>New Rules to Ease Emission Guidelines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will release new rules today to give older
coal-fired power plants more leeway to avoid costly maintenance to
reduce emissions, congressional sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Environmental Protection Agency will release its long-awaited
"new source review" guidelines, said Chris Miller, a Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee staffer.</LD>
<LD>   EPA spokesman Joe Martyak declined to comment on the timing for
the release of the rules.</LD>
<TE>   Existing rules require utilities and refineries to invest in
state-of-the-art pollution controls if a plant undergoes a major
expansion or modification.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration said in June it planned to relax the
rules to make it easier for utilities to perform major modifications
to extend the life of aging plants without triggering
pollution-reduction requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals, which do not require congressional approval, have
provoked protest from environmental groups and some Democrats, who
see them as relaxing the Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   "These rollbacks of the Clean Air Act are unacceptable and
endanger public health," said Democratic Rep. Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Markey called the planned changes "the postelection opening salvo
in the Republicans' war on our nation's clean-air and clean-water
laws."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the proposal were still fluid Thursday. The rules are
expected to widen an exemption for utilities and refineries from
installing new pollution devices when they conduct routine
maintenance and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules, "you can basically do everything but tear the
plant down and not trigger the requirements," said Phil Clapp,
president of the National Environmental Trust.</TE>
<TE>   The rules were awaiting approval from the White House Office of
Management and Budget.</TE>
<TE>   The Edison Electric Institute, which represents many large
utilities, applauded the change.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions may "remove the perpetual threat of litigation now
hanging over the heads of power plant operators facing difficult
decisions about whether to proceed with critical maintenance," EEI
spokesman Dan Riedinger said.</TE>

<HD>Cruise Ship Undergoes Scrubbing</HD>
<DH>The Amsterdam is sanitized after a virus sickens hundreds
on its last four voyages. Avoid handshakes, the passengers were told.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORT EVERGLADES, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The cruise ship Amsterdam returned to port Thursday for a
stem-to-stern scouring after more than 500 people on its last four
voyages got sick with a stomach virus.</LD>
<LD>   The ship had been scheduled to leave on a 10-day Caribbean cruise
Thursday, but the voyage was canceled so the vessel could be
sanitized.</LD>
<LD>   After the latest passengers disembarked, 573 crew members began
cleaning the ship, emptying garbage cans and wiping down remote
controls, clock radios, even Bibles. During the next 10 days, crew
members will replace 2,500 pillows and dry clean, steam clean and
disinfect every surface aboard the ship, which is 780 feet long and
has 690 staterooms.</LD>
<TE>   The Holland America cruise line said that during the ship's
just-completed 10-day voyage, 58 passengers and 18 crew members
developed symptoms associated with the Norwalk virus.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty-seven of the 1,305 passengers left the ship at various
ports in the Caribbean and were flown home.</TE>
<TE>   Many passengers said they enjoyed their vacation despite the
problems and did not mind the frequent reminders from the crew to
wash their hands and avoid handshakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than shaking hands, we rubbed elbows," said Joel Bennett,
a bassist for a Tommy Dorsey orchestra that performed on board.</TE>
<TE>   Other passengers said that they resented not being told of the
virus and the precautions until just before they boarded the ship
outside Fort Lauderdale.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I am concerned, they put us in harm's way," said Joseph
Carbonell of New Britain, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 454 passengers and 70 crew members have become sick within
the last month during four successive voyages aboard the Amsterdam.
The virus, spread through food and water and close contact with
infected people or things they have touched, can cause diarrhea,
stomach pain and vomiting.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise line had spent more than 10 hours scrubbing the
Amsterdam with a chlorine solution before it departed on its latest
voyage.</TE>
<TE>   On the cruise, passengers were barred from serving themselves at
buffets or touching any food or drinks but their own.</TE>
<TE>   "They were cleaning all the time. You'd see people and then they
would not be there for dinner, so you knew they got sick," said Lori
Druckeroff, a Boynton Beach retiree.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise line is working with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Holland America Line is owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp.</TE>

<HD>New Element to Wisconsin Deer Hunt: Chronic Wasting Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WAUSAU, Wis.</DL>
<LD>The state's traditional deer hunt opens Saturday with hunters
wondering for the first time whether their prey is infected with a
rare, always fatal brain disease.</LD>
<LD>   There are no documented cases of chronic wasting disease being
transmitted from deer to humans, but scientists say they cannot rule
out the possibility.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin officials have instructed hunters in how to avoid
potentially infected parts of the carcass while dressing their kill,
but they have not advised anyone against eating venison.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of licenses for hunting deer are down 15% from a year ago,
and officials blame concern about the disease.</TE>
<TE>   George Nowak, 71, of Wausau refused to buy a license this year,
ending a lifetime of hunting that began when he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something you look forward to, hunting season. But the
chance of getting some awful disease is just not worth it," he said.
"If you can't eat it, why shoot it?"</TE>
<TE>   The illness is related to so-called mad cow disease in cattle and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The ailments are believed to be
caused by proteins called prions, which make sponge-like holes in the
brain.</TE>
<TE>   In February, chronic wasting disease was found in Wisconsin deer,
marking the first time it was discovered east of the Mississippi
River. It is known to exist in deer or elk in at least eight states
and Canada; thousands of animals are being slaughtered in attempts to
contain it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the concern, more than 500,000 licenses have been sold for
the nine-day Wisconsin hunt, and there was never any suggestion that
the deer season be called off.</TE>
<TE>   Deer hunting is a $1-billion industry in Wisconsin, and it ranks
up there with Green Bay Packers football and cheese as cherished
Wisconsin traditions. Some high schools even cancel classes during
hunting season.</TE>
<TE>   State agencies have advised hunters not to cut into the animals'
spinal cords and lymph nodes, where the deadly proteins that cause
the disease accumulate. Hunters were also advised to wear disposable
gloves and use disposable knives and saws.</TE>
<TE>   The state estimates 1.6 million deer roam Wisconsin this fall, and
officials hope hunters kill 450,000 to 500,000 of the animals. But
the officials said that, because of worries about the safety of the
venison, some hunters may try to shoot only large bucks for their
trophy horns.</TE>
<TE>   The state wants hunters in every county to donate a total of
50,000 deer heads for testing for the disease in what it calls the
biggest wildlife disease survey ever conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a historic season," said Brad Koele, an assistant deer
ecologist for the state Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois officials also hope to test deer heads for the disease
with help from participants in a three-day hunt that begins today.
Last month, Illinois confirmed its first known case of the disease in
a deer shot near the Wisconsin state line.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin hunt continues an unprecedented attempt to kill all
deer -- at least 25,000 of them -- in an area west of Madison where
the disease was discovered in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Erickson, 36, a hunter from Owen who bought his license
Thursday, said he would not shoot a sickly looking deer.</TE>
<TE>   But apart from that, "I am not really worried about CWD," he said.
"I hope a bunch of other hunters go out there. Then there will be
fewer deer I have to worry about hitting on the roads."</TE>

<HD>Camp Pendleton Marines Leave for Persian Gulf</HD>
<DH>The deployment, part of an exercise planned for months,
puts the troops near possible front lines with Iraq. They join a
group that left last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>As the U.S. continues to deploy troops in preparation for a possible
war with Iraq, several hundred combat-trained Marines from Camp
Pendleton left Thursday night for the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   While the deployment has been planned for months as part of a
military exercise, it puts the Marines on the possible front lines of
a ground offensive against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Marines were set to take the 18-hour flight from March Reserve
Air Force Base in Riverside. A similar-sized group, led by Lt. Gen.
James Conway, left last week.</LD>
<TE>   The Marines are "prepared to engage in direct combat operations
and major-theater war," if ordered, said a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The troops are part of the acclaimed 1st Marine Expeditionary
Force, which fought the Iraqi army in Operation Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   In early October, the Pentagon ordered the Army's V Corps,
headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, and the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force, headquartered at this sprawling base in northern
San Diego County, to establish command centers near the Kuwaiti-Iraqi
border for a possible ground offensive against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   For security reasons, the Marines declined to identify the precise
destination of the force. The U.S. military has forces in Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The military exercise, dubbed Internal Look, was meant to test the
military's ability to quickly move a command staff into a war zone.
During the offensive against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan,
the U.S. Central Command maintained its headquarters in Tampa, Fla.,
causing some grumbling among troops on or near the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the exercise, which by all pretenses has become a
preparation for war, Army and Air Force troops will move to Al Udeid
Air Base outside Doha, Qatar, to use a state-of-the-art computerized
command center recently built at that isolated desert facility.</TE>
<TE>   Several thousand Army troops are already in Kuwait for desert
warfare training. In late September, 1,000 Marines from Camp
Pendleton engaged in a monthlong exercise there to sharpen skills
learned at the corps' desert training facility at Twentynine Palms in
San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 8, gunmen opened fire on Marines conducting an urban
warfare exercise on the Kuwaiti island of Faylakah, killing one
Marine and wounding another. That incident, and a shooting Thursday
that wounded two U.S. soldiers in Kuwait, has increased the anxiety
of family members of the departing Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is worried," said one Marine's wife, fighting back
tears.</TE>
<TE>   Just how many of the 45,000 troops assigned to the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force will be sent to the Persian Gulf is unclear. In
early January, 2,000 Marines and sailors are set to deploy to the
region aboard several ships that are part of the Tarawa Amphibious
Ready Group. The departure could be sooner if needed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Bee, senior analyst at the UC San Diego-based Institute on
Global Conflict and Cooperation, said President Bush is following a
strategy used by his father. Bee noted that in the months before
Operation Desert Storm, expeditionary units of Marines and other
military personnel were sent to Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "In traditional diplomacy, you have to back up what you say with a
show of force," Bee said. "The constant buildup of forces is a signal
to Iraq that we're serious and that we're approaching endgame."</TE>
<TE>   Often when military personnel deploy overseas, little or no public
notice is given. But this time, the Marines invited the media to
cover the departure.</TE>
<TE>   "They watch CNN in Baghdad too," Bee said.</TE>

<HD>Edwards Talks Education, With an Eye on 2004</HD>
<DH>N.C. Democratic senator follows recent remarks on foreign
policy and economy with a call for school reform and an attack on
Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>As wounded Democrats ponder their midterm election losses and the
reemergence of their 2000 presidential nominee, Sen. John Edwards
offered an education plan on Thursday, reminding the party that he,
too, is weighing a run for the White House in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The first-term North Carolinian proposed new spending to improve
high schools, raise teacher quality and open doors to college --
including a guarantee of free tuition for students in their first
year at public universities and community colleges.</LD>
<LD>   He also criticized President Bush for failing to put enough money
behind a new school reform law and for embracing voucher subsidies to
private schools. Bush, he said, "walked away from education reform."</LD>
<TE>   Edwards added: "We can give kids competition and choice within our
accountable public system."</TE>
<TE>   His speech at the University of Maryland followed remarks in
recent weeks on the economy and foreign policy, helping Edwards stay
visible among likely and possible contenders jockeying for position
in Al Gore's shadow.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, 49, has established himself, at least among party
insiders, as a prolific fund-raiser and a fresh face to be taken
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   But he must also show that he has the substance and the savvy to
emerge from a pack of hopefuls that could seek the nomination to
oppose Bush, whether or not Gore runs.</TE>
<TE>   The former vice president is blitzing the media this month, for
the first time since his defeat, but has said that he will not decide
on another candidacy until after the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   That is about the same timetable Edwards has set for himself. When
asked whether Gore's decision would affect his own, Edwards said:
"No, absolutely not."</TE>
<TE>   Because his Senate term ends in two years, Edwards also must
decide whether to seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   At least three other Democratic senators are mulling presidential
runs: John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut and Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri has stepped down as House minority leader as he considers
a candidacy. Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has already said that he will
run.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' rivals on Capitol Hill have far more experience than he
does, limiting his stature on the legislative stage.</TE>
<TE>   "There's three things that matter in the Senate -- seniority,
seniority, seniority," said Duke University political scientist
Michael C. Munger. "He doesn't have any of them."</TE>
<TE>   What Edwards does have is a distinct geographic identity as a
southern Democrat. Gore, of Tennessee, also could make that claim --
but he lost his home state, and the region, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The last three Democratic presidents came from the old
Confederacy: Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Jimmy Carter of Georgia and
Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards cannot rely on geography alone. The fight for the
Democratic nomination will kick off in Iowa and New Hampshire and
require candidates to generate enthusiasm among the faithful -- and
generally liberal -- voters who turn out for the early caucuses and
primaries.</TE>
<TE>   In his speeches, Edwards has sought positions that appeal to core
Democrats while keeping a foot in the moderate wing.</TE>
<TE>   On foreign policy on Oct. 7, he supported Bush's drive for a
resolution to authorize military force against Iraq but backed more
foreign aid and criticized the president for "gratuitous
unilateralism."</TE>
<TE>   On the economy on Nov. 12, he accused Democrats of seeking to
spend too much and Republicans of kowtowing to corporate interests.
He called for delaying tax cuts scheduled to kick in in coming years
for couples who earn more than $200,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   On education Thursday, Edwards aligned himself firmly against
private school vouchers. That is Democratic orthodoxy. He also
complained that many teachers in the nation's lowest-performing
schools are overworked and underpaid, statements likely to be greeted
favorably by union members.</TE>
<TE>   But he supported public charter schools as reform laboratories,
and extra aid to districts that allow parents to enroll their
children in a public school of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   And he called for tenure reform to ensure that teachers who fail
to meet minimum standards can be removed. Those steps are not
universally popular among teacher unions.</TE>
<TE>   To help public schools attract teachers where they are most
needed, Edwards proposed to pay tuition for college students who
commit to teach for five years in low-performing districts. He also
urged an additional $3 billion a year to help raise salaries for
teachers in challenging jobs and additional aid to promote smaller
high schools.</TE>
<TE>   To help college students, he proposed a full subsidy for the first
year of tuition at public universities or community colleges -- in
exchange for a student's commitment to do community service work. And
he called on colleges to end admission systems that grant preferences
to early applicants and to children of alumni.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, a former trial lawyer and son of a textile mill
supervisor, used his own background to emphasize his points.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this is not an abstraction," Edwards said. "My parents
didn't go to college." But he earned a bachelor's degree at North
Carolina State University and a law degree at the University of North
Carolina, both with honors.</TE>
<TE>   "Without that combination of support from loving parents, terrific
teachers and public schools at every level, I would never be standing
here today," he said.</TE>

<HD>Study to Bury Power Plant Emissions Is Funded</HD>
<DH>The research is part of the administration's $90-million
battle against global warming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will spend as much as $90 million on programs
to fight global warming, including studying ways to remove power
plant carbon dioxide emissions from the air and storing them deep
underground, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The process, carbon sequestration, has prompted hopes in the farm
sector of a new source of income -- payments for curbing air
pollution -- and has been raised at international conferences as a
way to deal with so-called greenhouse gases.</LD>
<LD>   The Energy Department said a research team headed by American
Electric Power and Battelle could begin studying potential
sequestration sites in the Ohio River Valley, where carbon emissions
from power plants could be stored underground.</LD>
<TE>   "Theoretically, [underground sites] could hold all of the carbon
dioxide emitted by the nation's coal-burning power plants for the
next 100 years," Abraham told the National Coal Council. "But we will
move deliberately, because we want to go as far and as fast as the
science takes us."</TE>
<TE>   The administration currently provides about $50 million annually
to develop technologies to reduce or capture power plant emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said the administration also would fund four to 10
regional sequestration partnerships nationwide. These, formed by the
power industry, local governments and universities, would develop
technology to trim carbon dioxide emissions in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have yet to determine the most effective and least
costly method for capturing and storing carbon dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   The United States generates an estimated 5.8 billion tons of
carbon dioxide annually, according to the Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   While the popularity of carbon removal is likely to grow as
technology improves, experts believe the near-term focus will be on
other methods of trimming pollution, including greater fuel
efficiency and alternative fuels.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you do this, if you want to start taking carbon out of the
energy system, this is probably not the first thing you are going to
do," said Edward Rubin, professor of environmental engineering and
science at Carnegie Mellon University.</TE>
<TE>   By 2050, as much as 250 billion tons of carbon could be captured
from the atmosphere and stored in soil or underground, officials with
the Energy Department have estimated. An average of 3.5 billion tons
could be removed annually, up from about 2 billion tons currently.</TE>
<TE>   John McCormick, spokesman for the Citizens Coal Council, which
works to protect communities and the environment from coal pollution,
said the country is "stuck" with coal, the dominant fuel for power
plants. The United States has the world's largest coal reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Pollution from coal has dropped about 30% over the last 30 years
as new technology has been introduced.</TE>

<HD>Indian Bureau Chief Announces His Retirement</HD>
<DH>Neal A. McCaleb's tenure was marred by controversy
concerning trust fund management.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Neal A. McCaleb, whose 17 months as the Bush administration's top
official for Indian programs have been marred by controversy
concerning management of Indian trust funds, has given notice he will
retire at the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "It is with great reluctance, deep regret and a sense of personal
loss that I accept the retirement of Neal McCaleb," Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton said in a statement. "Neal serves as an
extremely valuable member of my leadership team and he will be very
difficult to replace."</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure as assistant secretary for Indian affairs,
McCaleb's efforts were focused on untangling a troubled trust fund
for royalties to Indians that has been mismanaged for more than a
century.</LD>
<TE>   In September, he and Norton were held in contempt of court by U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth for failing to comply with Lamberth's
order to fix the trust fund, which manages $500 million a year in
oil, gas, mining and timber royalties from Indian lands, and
concealing their failure to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "The constraints imposed by ever-present litigation have taken
their toll," McCaleb said in a statement. "Unfortunately, the
litigation has taken first priority in too many activities, thus
distracting attention from the other important goals that could
provide more long-term funding for Indian country."</TE>
<TE>   He sought to make sweeping changes to the trust fund management,
but met initial resistance from Indian leaders and negotiations
bogged down and were broken off.</TE>
<TE>   McCaleb argued for increased economic opportunity on Indian
reservations and additional spending for Indian education.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a proponent of the administration's aborted efforts to
privatize some Indian schools and pressed for increased energy
production on reservations, a component of President Bush's energy
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Indian Affairs oversees the education of 50,000
Indian schoolchildren and administers roughly 2,000 reservation law
enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian trust fund that dominated McCaleb's tenure was
established in 1887, when Congress assigned American Indians small
parcels of land and directed the Interior Department to manage the
royalties. For more than a century, an untold amount of money meant
for some of the nation's poorest residents was lost, stolen or never
collected.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Indians sued in 1996, claiming the government
squandered between $10 billion and $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Lamberth ordered the Interior Department to fix the management
problems and to put together an accounting of what the Indians are
owed.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Lamberth said Norton and McCaleb committed "fraud on
the court" in concealing the failures to fix the fund.</TE>
<TE>   McCaleb, 67, is a member of the Chickasaw tribe and was
transportation secretary in Oklahoma before he was tapped by Bush to
head the BIA.</TE>
<TE>   He was a civil engineer and businessman and a member of the
Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1974 to 1982. He ran for
governor in 1982, losing in the Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   He was also appointed to Indian economic development panels by
Presidents Nixon and Reagan.</TE>

<HD>Prison Corporation Hurting U.S. Workers, Congressmen Say</HD>
<DH>The outfit's exclusive contracts with federal agencies shut
out small firms, lawmakers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers on Thursday assailed a government-run corporation that uses
prisoners to make products, saying it puts other Americans out of
work.</LD>
<LD>   Federal Prison Industries Inc. makes 150 products, including
office furniture, electronics and textiles, and its entire product
line is sold exclusively to federal agencies. The agencies must buy
their products from FPI, under the trade name Unicor, unless the
corporation does not manufacture the item or it grants a waiver
allowing the agency to shop elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) said FPI is selling products that
are not made by prisoners, but by other private companies that
contract with FPI to get their exclusive access to government
contracts.</LD>
<TE>   He said he would ask Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to reassign Steve
Schwalb, FPI's chief operating officer, who was in the audience at
the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Rocks, the new chairman of FPI's board of directors,
promised to make sure prisoners do not put law-abiding Americans out
of work.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not want to be a plant manager in Vineland, N.J., and
tell my workers, 'If you want to continue making shirts for the
military, then rob a bank because your job just went to the federal
prison,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwalb also was targeted by Rep. Donald A. Manzullo, chairman of
the House Small Business Committee, who demanded that he remove a
statement from the corporation's Web site which said that FPI was
working with the committee to strengthen its relationship with small
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want my name as chairman of this committee associated
with the forced labor of FPI," said Manzullo, an Illinois Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation, an arm of the Justice Department's Federal Bureau
of Prisons, employs nearly 22,560 prisoners, or 18% of federal
inmates. In 2001, it had sales of $583.5 million. The program is
promoted as providing job training that inmates can use once they are
released.</TE>
<TE>   Several small-business owners said that they could offer better
quality, lower prices and quicker delivery than FPI, but that they
are kept out of the market for U.S. contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Manzullo called Schwalb out of the audience later to ask whether
the Internet reference had been taken down.</TE>
<TE>   Schwalb left and returned shortly after with a printout of the Web
site showing that the reference had been removed.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Schwalb would not comment on any criticism
except to say, "I think it's to be expected in a hearing where C-SPAN
is operating."</TE>
<TE>   Angela Styles, administrator for federal procurement policy at the
Office of Management and Budget, said the White House is committed to
reforming FPI to promote competition. But she said that the program
has been successful in keeping prisoners from returning to a life of
crime and that there is concern that changes to the exclusive
contracts will increase unrest in the prisons.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged that some FPI contracts are going to products
built outside the prisons, but she said OMB is not sure how
widespread the practice is and is considering how to respond.</TE>

<HD>Network's Calls to Rabbi's Jury Anger Judge</HD>
<DH>Sentencing hearing in murder-for-hire case is delayed.
'Good Morning America' telephoned members of the panel weighing death
penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FREEHOLD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The sentencing hearing for a rabbi convicted of having his wife
killed was delayed for two hours Thursday as the judge angrily
criticized the media for trying to contact the jury.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Linda Baxter closed the courtroom and polled
jurors to find out who had contacted them.</LD>
<LD>   "It is an outrage, frankly, that the media has so little respect
for this court of law," Baxter said.</LD>
<TE>   She said representatives of ABC's "Good Morning America" had
called seven people on the panel. Saying none had responded to the
inquiries, Baxter ordered the hearing to proceed, saying "ABC should
consider itself to be warned."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey W. Schneider, vice president of ABC News, said the bookers
were not aware of the judge's order forbidding journalists from
contacting jurors. They merely left messages, he said, and did not
actually speak with any jurors.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Good Morning America' is very blessed to have aggressive and
excellent bookers and producers, and in this case they seem to have
gotten a little ahead of themselves," Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   The same jury that convicted Rabbi Fred Neulander of hiring two
men to kill his wife must now decide whether he should be executed or
spend life in prison for the 1994 murder. His son Benjamin pleaded
for his father's life on the stand Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The media have constantly been a part of the Neulander saga. One
of the hit men first confessed to a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter
more than two years ago. And during Neulander's first trial, which
ended with a hung jury, a magazine journalist was fined after
approaching a juror during deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   After the first trial, four reporters from the Inquirer were
sanctioned for publishing the names of jurors and three were
sanctioned for seeking interviews. They are appealing their fines and
community service sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Neulander, 61, was convicted Wednesday of capital murder, felony
murder and conspiracy in the killing of Carol Neulander, 52, in their
suburban Philadelphia home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say he hired two men to kill her in order to pursue an
affair with a Philadelphia radio personality.</TE>
<TE>   The hit men are both awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to
aggravated manslaughter.</TE>

<HD>Federal Airport Workers Tell of Pay Glitches</HD>
<DH>Employee miscues and problems that come with hiring tens of
thousands of screeners keep some from getting their money on time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of new federal airport security screeners hailed as
front-line defenders in the war on terrorism are working without pay
because of logistical glitches, government officials acknowledge.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very crucial issue for us and we take it seriously," said
Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Transportation Security
Administration. "We have committed extra staff to our payroll
facility. Our goal is to ensure that all screeners are paid on time
the first time."</LD>
<LD>   TSA took credit this week for meeting a tough congressional
deadline for staffing all passenger checkpoints with federal
screeners. But some employees were in no mood to celebrate. One
Southern California screener is fending off creditors after going a
month without pay.</LD>
<TE>   "My car is going to get repossessed any day now, and I'm just
wondering when," said the screener, who asked not to be identified
for fear of being fired.</TE>
<TE>   The screener, who has a family, earns about $13 an hour. The job
comes with a full package of federal employee benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "The job is good, and I enjoy meeting people," the screener said.
But "everything is so unorganized right now. They've got paperwork
flying everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, an average of 500 screeners were not getting their
money on payday; that is down now to about 300, Turmail said.</TE>
<TE>   Missed checks are just one example of personnel problems that
include schedules subject to unpredictable changes and workers not
getting credit for overtime and training hours, says a union official
who is trying to organize the more than 40,000 screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Six Weeks of No Pay</TE>
<TE>   "They are not being treated fairly and they don't have any voice,"
said William Lyons, a national organizer for the American Federation
of Government Employees. One screener went six weeks without a
paycheck, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the largest single work force hired in years," Lyons
added. "If they didn't need union representation, I wouldn't be
getting calls from all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   AFGE, which represents 650,000 federal workers, could add as many
as 50,000 more dues-paying members if the organizing drive succeeds.
Under current law, screeners can join a union, but they are not
permitted to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Union representation may be jeopardized when screeners come under
the umbrella of the new Department of Homeland Security. President
Bush fought Democrats in Congress to win authority to waive
collective bargaining rights for homeland security employees. But
it's still unclear whether he will use that power broadly or focus on
units carrying out very sensitive missions. Bush has also said he
wants to preserve the rights of workers.</TE>
<TE>   TSA spokesman Turmail said the agency regards its screeners as the
foundation of effective security and is striving to resolve pay and
personnel problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the difficulties are the inevitable consequence of having
had to hire tens of thousands of people in the span of a few months.
"It's simply the logistical challenge of entering several thousand
individuals a week into a system where folks' information needs to be
entered manually," Turmail said.</TE>
<TE>   Largest Force at LAX</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, which has the largest
screener force of any airport in the country, federal security
director David Stone said he wants to eliminate payday glitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Pay is the issue where we are pushing to get it right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the last payday, Nov. 12, Stone said 130 of his screeners did
not get their wages. He said he has cut that down to fewer than 30
with potential problems for the upcoming Nov. 26 payday, two days
before Thanksgiving. LAX currently has more than 2,200 screeners and
Stone expects that number to grow to 3,200 by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said his staff has been calling creditors on behalf of
employees and issuing letters that screeners can take to their
landlords. Some screeners have received emergency advances on the pay
that was being held up.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was created by a number of factors, from bottlenecks
in information processing to employee mistakes, Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   In about 20% of the cases, screeners provided incorrect account
numbers for direct deposit.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the foul-ups were the result of various logistical
problems involving TSA's payroll unit or a contractor assisting with
the hiring process.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, LAX was shipping paper time cards to TSA's payroll
facility in Oklahoma City. Stone said he decided that procedure was
unacceptable in the age of computer networks. LAX now files payroll
data electronically.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not want to be tied to manually bundling up time cards,"
Stone said. "LAX is one of the first airports to go to electronic
pay. Eventually, the rest of the airports will be doing the same."</TE>
<TE>   Not getting paid is especially demoralizing for employees, but
constantly changing work schedules are another sore point with
screeners.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks with child-care issues get their schedules for the next
week, make all the arrangements, and then two days later the schedule
changes," said Lyons, the union organizer.</TE>
<TE>   Turmail said screeners are warned that schedules may be

<HD>Voters in Seattle OK Monorail Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Voters here gave the go-ahead for a monorail that would streak
quietly across the city's skyline.</LD>
<LD>   The $1.7-billion, 14-mile expansion of Seattle's landmark monorail
was approved by city residents by a mere 877 votes out of about
189,000 cast, according to election day totals made official
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to put Seattle back on the map as the pioneer
city that we are," said Patrick Kylen, one of the idea's chief
supporters.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, voters in Washington state defeated a proposed,
9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase that would have raised $7.7
billion for transportation projects, mainly highways.</TE>
<TE>   The money for the monorail project will come from a 1.4% motor
vehicle excise tax.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen miles of elevated track will be built through the city,
expanding on the monorail that has glided a single mile over the city
since the 1962 World's Fair. Running between the Space Needle and
downtown, it's mainly a tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the project say it will be a pollution-free
alternative that will enable people to glide to work, unaffected by
stoplights and traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents warned of budget overruns and a marred skyline and
said that ultimately it may do little to ease the headaches of
commuting.</TE>
<TE>   The city has yet to pick a design, a designer or a builder but
hopes to have a good portion of the line up and running by 2007.</TE>

<HD>More Money Urged to Improve Child Immunization Rates</HD>
<DH>Study says 3 million lives are saved a year, but more funds
may double that. World coverage is at 70%, yet disparities among
nations remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Trick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three million lives are saved each year through childhood vaccines
and immunizations, but that success rate could double with more
funding and support, according to a new report on the state of
vaccines worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Major progress has been achieved controlling measles, tetanus,
tuberculosis and whooping cough, and steps are being made to tackle
influenza and strains of hepatitis, according to the 116-page report
produced jointly by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the
World Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Polio is nearly eradicated, the report says. Pockets of the
scourge remain only in the most destitute areas of 10 nations in
Africa and Southeast Asia, the report said, and the disease was wiped
out in Congo in 2001, despite fierce fighting there. However, only
$725 million of the estimated $1 billion needed between now and 2005
to fight the disease has been secured, casting doubt on a final push
to end polio worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   "In many regions of the world, it is more the rule than the
exception for children to die of common childhood conditions such as
measles, which alone causes 700,000 deaths a year," said Dr. Gro
Harlem Brundtland, director-general of WHO, in a statement announcing
the report's release this week. "We need to act fast and effectively
to ensure that children and adults everywhere have access to
life-saving vaccines."</TE>
<TE>   With an additional investment of $250 million a year, at least 10
million more children would have access to basic vaccines, WHO said.
Also, newer vaccines, such as hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza
type B, or Hib, would cost only $100 million more a year. Together
the two diseases kill 970,000 children in developing nations each
year.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, worldwide immunization coverage was
maintained at 70%, the report found. However, the number without
context hides the disparities among developing nations, those in
stagnation and those with a public health system capable of fully
treating its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Fissures grew in countries such as India, where 40% of the world's
polio cases occur in only four districts in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh. Nations in Africa, where civil wars and revolutions
defer state funding from the public health infrastructure, have seen
vaccination rates slip since their peak of 55% in 1990, while South
American nations have seen their rates approach 87% for all vaccines.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Edward Hoekstra has seen the benefits of immunization
firsthand. In a measles inoculation effort in late June, Hoekstra and
a crew of 10,000 health workers from WHO, UNICEF and the local Red
Cross managed a 94% coverage rate in Kenya, which also hosts 200,000
refugees from war-torn Somalia and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   "We averted 10,000 deaths immediately," said Hoekstra, senior
health advisor for UNICEF's Global Measles Programme. "We're going to
Ghana next week, and soon Cameroon."</TE>
<TE>   Hoekstra began his global health work with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, where he helped establish public health
clinics in South America. Revisiting them decades later, Hoekstra
realized how important his efforts have been.</TE>
<TE>   "I was visiting a clinic in Venezuela I had helped create. It was
good to see the clinic was still there, but it was a shock to see the
same doctors were still there," Hoekstra said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the early success was that the programs were not overly
ambitious, Hoekstra said. He helped provide basic public health that
a developing state could sustain. Working with WHO and UNICEF, their
goal was to create and fund specific and viable programs that would
produce a desired outcome of better public health. Success was
measured by how many programs were created and how long they lasted,
Hoekstra said.</TE>
<TE>   But billionaire businessman Bill Gates changed that in January
2000 with a $750-million donation over five years to the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, which now coordinates
vaccination efforts worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The major donation by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation thrust
GAVI into a managerial role. The alliance formed by governments,
international groups such as UNICEF, international banks, the vaccine
industry and private donors such as the Gates Foundation administers
the Vaccine Fund, which the Gateses first filled. The Vaccine Fund
now totals $1.56 billion, thanks to help from developing nations and
other private foundations.</TE>
<TE>   The Gates Foundation, however, shuns the idea that the Microsoft
founder runs the show. "We're not in the front seat," said Anne Marie
Hou, a foundation spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   GAVI approaches world public health by getting a developing
country to invest in its own public health infrastructure. Countries
receiving support from the Vaccine Fund have been asked to analyze
their infrastructure and find ways to make vaccinations and
immunizations a sustainable project.</TE>
<TE>   "We work with countries to develop a plan," said Hou of the
foundation's role. "We don't build infrastructure, but we get the
vaccines there."</TE>

<HD>Those New Tricks Came From Old Dogs</HD>
<DH>Human contact over millenniums altered canines' DNA, a
study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the genetic journey from wolf to lapdog, dogs developed a unique
genius for sensing human intentions, as the interplay of handler and
hound shaped the biology of canine behavior in ways that scientists
only now are beginning to understand, new research shows.</LD>
<LD>   Dogs are tailored to fit the human mind, like a glove to the hand.</LD>
<LD>   From birth, dogs are fluent in the human text of hand gestures and
facial expressions. Their ability to understand humans is better than
chimpanzees -- humanity's closest relative -- or the gray wolves from
which dogs are descended, according to the first direct comparison of
the species. Harvard University anthropologist Brian Hare, who
conducted the comparison, publishes his experiments today in the
journal Science.</LD>
<TE>   This unusual canine social skill does not come from training or
experience; nor is it the legacy of a pack species with its own rich
vocabulary of body language, Hare said. It arises from genes shaped
by human contact, inherited by every contemporary dog, his
experiments suggest.</TE>
<TE>   "We have created the dog in our own image," said developmental
geneticist Jasper Rine at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Through a series of research papers in Science, three independent
teams of scientists, including Hare, explored the evolution of dogs
-- from feral scavengers to man's best friend -- to better understand
one of humanity's earliest innovations: the domestication of animals.</TE>
<TE>   By analyzing canine DNA from around the world, the researchers
determined that the domestication of dogs was an inspiration that
swept the ancient world more quickly and more recently than
previously believed. Every one of nearly 400 breeds today descends
originally from just five female wolves in East Asia, scientists
said.</TE>
<TE>   As perhaps the first wild animal to fall under human sway, dogs
offer an unusually clear window into how genes and selective breeding
can shape behavior. People have manipulated virtually every aspect of
canine design and demeanor, culling for those traits that humans deem
most useful in these cold-nosed companions.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs trace their ancestry to primordial wolves that thrived about
a million years ago, said Xaoming Wang, an expert on vertebrate
paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. In
all, there are 35 canine species alive today, only one of which --
the domestic dog -- is the object of human affection.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest fossil evidence of this special relationship was
unearthed from a grave in Israel, dating from about 12,000 years ago.
In its left hand, the human skeleton cradled a pup.</TE>
<TE>   By themselves, however, these poignant remains do not reveal
whether the bones belong to a dog or a wolf, or why they were
cherished. So far, no fossil shows where, when or why these animals
were first domesticated.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few hard facts about the origin of dogs, just a
lot of guessing," said geneticist Peter Savolainen of Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   In search of reliable answers, the scientists turned to the
animals' DNA, gathering genetic material from hundreds of dogs in
Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Arctic. Researchers also
successfully exhumed DNA from fossil remains of dogs that lived in
North and South America before Christopher Columbus and European
settlers began arriving.</TE>
<TE>   These DNA samples all were extracted from the tiny
energy-producing parts of the cell called mitochondria, which are
inherited relatively unchanged from the mother. That allowed
researchers to trace a direct genetic line of descent across
thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Their findings suggest domestication was a canine epic that began
more recently than previously believed and originated in East Asia,
far from the Middle East, the region long considered the cradle of
agriculture and animal husbandry.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing a global canine menagerie, Savolainen at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm and colleagues at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences determined that dogs may have been domesticated
perhaps just 15,000 years ago, compared with previous estimates of
100,000 years ago or more.</TE>
<TE>   In the largest study of its kind, they looked at the genetic
variations in 654 domestic dogs and 38 Eurasian wolves.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists used minute genetic differences between the animals
to calibrate a kind of molecular clock that allowed them to estimate
the pace of canine evolution and to gauge its epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   "We see that there is much higher genetic variation in East Asia
than in other parts of the world. That suggests to us that dogs
originated there, and a few dogs then spread to other parts of the
world, taking just part of that genetic variation with them,"
Savolainen said.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when stone tools, spears and fire were high technology,
the radical idea of a working partnership between man and beast
spread quickly among nomadic tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs reached the Americas with the first human settlers of the
Western Hemisphere about 12,000 years ago, researchers at the
National Museum of Natural History and UCLA concluded in a separate
study.</TE>
<TE>   "Our results suggest the dogs walked with them across the Bering
land bridge" from Siberia to Alaska, said UCLA evolutionary biologist
Robert Wayne. "They were already a fundamental part of human
society."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is happy with the idea that dogs might have been
domesticated so recently.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Wayne, are convinced that the process was far more
gradual, beginning as much as 100,000 years ago. That would allow
more time for the species to be tamed and then gradually integrated
into human life.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggest that the very speed with which the partnership
became part of prehistoric human culture is a measure of just how
indispensable dogs had become to humans as all-purpose, living
utility tools, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There must have been something advantageous about those dogs that
made them extremely successful and allowed them to spread all over
the world," said Carles Vila of Uppsala University in Sweden. "If
dogs were, for example, improving the quality of hunting, that would
be a very great advantage for humans. It could even have made the
colonization of the New World easier."</TE>
<TE>   Wayne and other researchers led by Smithsonian geneticist Jennifer
Leonard initially looked at mitochondrial DNA isolated from ancient
dog remains from Latin America and Alaska to see whether dogs had
evolved independently in the New World.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs were common in the Americas long before Europeans arrived.
The oldest known dog remains in the Americas, discovered in Danger
Cave, Utah, date from 10,000 years ago, comparable in antiquity to
canine remains unearthed at sites in Germany, Israel and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   That left researchers wondering whether dogs had indeed spread so
quickly around the globe in the eons before transoceanic travel, or
whether native American dogs, such as the Eskimo dog, Mexican
hairless and Chesapeake Bay retrievers, were descended from American
wolves.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard's team reconstructed their pedigree by examining DNA from
37 dog remains from pre-Columbian Mexico, Peru and Bolivia and
discovered some unique genetic types.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also looked at genetic sequences from dog remains
unearthed in Alaska that date to a time before European explorers
arrived in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs of the Western Hemisphere -- ancient and modern -- owe
their origins to the same East Asian wolves that gave rise to all
other dogs, Leonard determined.</TE>
<TE>   Those Western Hemisphere breeds that do survive today, such as the
Eskimo dog and the Mexican hairless, genetically are virtually
indistinguishable from Eurasian dogs. The unique strains identified
in the ancient remains are nowhere to be found today. Leonard
speculated that those native American dogs had been systematically
eliminated by European colonists.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these native American heritages have not been preserved
in the present gene pool of dogs," Leonard said. "Several things
might have happened. The conquistadors may have purposefully killed
off the dogs. The new European dogs also may have had more status
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   A still unresolved scientific question, the researchers said, is
just which species -- humans or wolves -- made the first move in the
collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Wolves may have initiated the relationship, attracted by the
refuse accumulating around prehistoric human campsites.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it entirely clear, Rine said, just which species is truly
the senior partner or how the company of dogs has altered the biology
of human character.</TE>
<TE>   "My dog can get me to give her affection any time, any place she
wants," Rine said. "I would say I am extraordinarily well-trained."</TE>

<HD>Lockyer Defends Unusual Rackauckas Investigation</HD>
<DH>Attorney general says gravity of accusations justifies
recording. He criticizes Orange County D.A., even though the probe
found no crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer and Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday said his office was
justified in asking a top official in the Orange County district
attorney's office to wear a hidden recording device for a criminal
investigation of the office, given the seriousness of the
accusations.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Lockyer said that his office had found no
evidence warranting criminal prosecution and that his agents have no
continuing investigation of the district attorney. But the attorney
general, who by law has oversight of county prosecutors, sharply
criticized Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   "While we do not have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a
crime, I've never seen a district attorney get so close to the line
repeatedly," he said. "People in positions of authority have a duty
to be extra careful."</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer would not say what specific accusation prompted his office
to set up the undercover operation.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred shortly before his office assisted the Orange County
Grand Jury in a separate investigation into the district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the panel issued a lengthy report that faulted Rackauckas
on an array of issues, including what it said were misuse of office
resources, poor management and intervention in cases involving
political supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment for this article. He has maintained
in the past that the grand jury was unduly swayed by his political
enemies and that his conduct has been appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Clesceri, the D.A.'s assistant investigations chief and a
former Rackauckas ally, secretly wore the recording device -- a rare
case in which one law enforcement agency has performed an undercover
investigation of another.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and defense attorneys in Orange County said they were
stunned by the undercover effort.</TE>
<TE>   "A senior investigator wearing a wire to record other employees in
the D.A.'s office? I wouldn't believe it," said Tom Goethals, former
head of the district attorney's homicide unit and now an Orange
County defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Goethals said he is concerned about the controversy, which Lockyer
and others have said is damaging morale in the state's third-largest
prosecuting office.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it ends soon because this isn't good for the system or the
community," Goethals said.</TE>
<TE>   Some details of Clesceri's work for the attorney general were
outlined in a letter that his lawyer to the office last week. The
letter did not disclose the extent of the undercover operation,
including who was recorded or how long Clesceri wore the device.
According to the letter, officials in the district attorney's office
learned of Clesceri's undercover work and have attempted to question
him about it. On Nov. 13, Clesceri's lawyer, Michael Stone, sent the
office a letter requesting that Clesceri not be questioned about his
undercover work because of an unspecified medical ailment. He also
indicated that Lockyer's office had instructed Clesceri to remain
silent.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Stone defended Clesceri's work.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I know about the case is Mike did nothing wrong, and
he was acting ... as directed by the attorney general," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's office started the investigation in 2001 after three
prosecutors traveled to Sacramento to complain about what they
claimed were criminal acts by Rackauckas. Rackauckas has said those
officials were political enemies with a vendetta against him.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he has no regrets about how the case was handled.</TE>
<TE>   "We take very seriously charges of political corruption," he said,
noting that the use of concealed recording devices "is a routine
investigative technique if you think you've got evidence of
wrongdoing."</TE>

<HD>Crowd Jams Ahmanson Hearing</HD>
<DH>Public comment will continue today, after which Ventura
County planning commissioners will vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study of the controversial Ahmanson Ranch mini-city near
Calabasas moved toward a key vote Thursday as dozens of speakers told
Ventura County planning commissioners that the subdivision is either
an environmental disaster or relief to Southern California's housing
crunch.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing chamber was so packed with people wanting to speak that
officials set up an overflow room nearby, equipped with a TV monitor
carrying the testimony live.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners listened to more than eight hours of testimony
before cutting off debate. The hearing will continue today at 8:30
a.m. at the Hall of Administration in Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   After all public comments, the commission will vote to approve or
deny the 3,050-home golf course project. Its recommendation will go
to the Board of Supervisors, which is expected to hear the issue in
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's hearing was the second stage of review for an
environmental study ordered by supervisors in December 2000 after
Ahmanson Ranch biologists found the endangered San Fernando Valley
spineflower and California red-legged frog on project lands.</TE>
<TE>   The 4,000-page document concludes that the two species can be
adequately protected with safeguards agreed to by developer
Washington Mutual Bank. A Ventura County committee made up of
technical staff gave its approval to the study last month.</TE>
<TE>   While opponents have faithfully turned up at each hearing to
protest the project, its supporters have been less visible. That
changed Thursday, when dozens of pro-Ahmanson advocates showed up.</TE>
<TE>   They listened attentively as Guy Gniadek, president of Ahmanson
Land Co., unveiled a 10-minute video outlining measures his company
has taken to protect the dime-sized spineflower and the red-legged
frog.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing bright green "Yes -- Build It!" stickers, supporters urged
commissioners to allow the project to go forward, saying that housing
is badly needed.</TE>
<TE>   Bernice Kalemkarian of Simi Valley said she often sees Palmdale
advertised as an affordable place to live. But the 80-year-old
grandmother said she wants her family close by.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we grandparents, who raised our children in Ventura
County, have to drive more than 100 miles to see our grandchildren?"</TE>
<TE>   Others said Ahmanson Ranch has been unfairly criticized when it
should be applauded as a model for how to build neighborhoods in a
responsible and environmentally sensitive way.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has already turned over 10,000 acres for open space,
planted 2,000 oaks and has won several awards for drawing up an
energy-efficient subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ahmanson people should be praised for being responsible
corporate citizens," said Jerry Miller, a Thousand Oaks resident and
president emeritus of Cal Lutheran University.</TE>
<TE>   Don Facciano, president of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn.,
noted that the project was approved by supervisors in 1992 and that
if the county attempts to stop it now, it will be sued for millions
of dollars by the developer.</TE>
<TE>   He called opponents "so-called activists" and "Hollywood celebrity
cheerleaders" who have tried repeatedly to halt the project in the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't get their way in the court and they want the
supervisors to come up with a phony environmental pretext" to evade
the development deal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maribel De La Torre, a member of the San Fernando City Council,
read a letter signed by 25 other Los Angeles County politicians
stating their support. The mayors and council members of several
small cities, including Lynwood, Norwalk and Alhambra, cited the
region's worsening housing shortage and spiraling home prices as
reasons to allow the project to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents were just as vocal.</TE>
<TE>   As they have in past hearings, they cited a variety of problems
with the proposed subdivision and the environmental study of it.</TE>
<TE>   Many said they are concerned about increased traffic and air
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village physician Ron de la Pena noted that Ventura
County's air quality already is among the worst in the nation and
predicted that respiratory illnesses would go up.</TE>
<TE>   "Voting for this project is a death sentence for unsuspecting
residents," De la Pena said. "It's unconscionable to approve this ...
just so that a few houses, shops and golf courses can be built."</TE>
<TE>   Others said they are worried that ancient Chumash caves could be
disturbed, or even destroyed, if the subdivision goes up nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Alul-Koy Lotah, who said she grew up in Ventura and roamed the
sage-covered hills at the ranch as a girl, asked commissioners to
consider the possible harm.</TE>
<TE>   "[The opposition] went silent, so I went silent. I thought it had
gone away," said Lotah, who now lives in Bradley, near Monterey. "But
now I'm thinking about the frogs and flowers and about my sacred
home."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most significant were the comments of Dennis Dickerson,
executive officer of the state Regional Water Quality Control Board
in Los Angeles. Dickerson told commissioners that his board has
"serious reservations" about discharge of sediments from the project
into downstream Malibu Creek during the rainy season.</TE>
<TE>   The board is also concerned about the recent discovery of the
toxin perchlorate in a well near the Ahmanson Ranch project site, he
said. More study is needed to find out if the contaminant is present
in ground water underlying the project, Dickerson told commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   His comments could signal more roadblocks for the project, even if
approved by the Board of Supervisors, because the state water board
must also approve some permits before construction.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch has been planned since 1986. Opponents mounted a
campaign to defeat it 10 years ago, when it first came before the
Board of Supervisors, but were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Years of litigation, and the 1999 discovery of the threatened frog
and flower, delayed the project.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents' campaign got new life last year when Hollywood director
Rob Reiner and a host of other celebrities joined the battle,
bringing money and star power.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana District Sues to Block Tustin Zoning</HD>
<DH>A deal to pay schools $60 million is at issue. Mayor says
district officials are impeding payment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest twist in the protracted dispute over the closed Tustin
Marine base, Tustin's mayor said Thursday that the Santa Ana Unified
School District's efforts to bar the city from zoning the property
will only "sabotage" their deal to pay the district $60 million.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is how Tustin will guarantee the money it has agreed to
pay the district for its share of the base.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Ana district took the city back to court last week,
winning a temporary restraining order on zoning of the base pending a
Dec. 2 hearing in Orange County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas, in a letter sent Thursday to school board
President John Palacio, said the court order is "counterproductive"
to the district being paid on time. "Unfortunately, the [school]
district's attorneys are bent on shutting down zoning and sales of
property at the base," Thomas wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The city has said that obtaining a letter of credit would cost too
much in bank fees. The district requested the letter so it could
obtain a loan to start building schools before the scheduled May
payment date, or a deed of trust if Tustin could not secure that
letter.</TE>
<TE>   The city and district disagree over whether Tustin tried hard
enough to secure the letter before offering the deed.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Families Bound by Hope</HD>
<DH>As surgery looms for a Northern California boy with
Sanfilippo disease, his parents find support from others fighting
same battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>John and Alicia Bennett will become members of an unofficial club
today that parents join only in desperation.</LD>
<LD>   They have a child with a rare genetic condition called Sanfilippo
syndrome, which causes progressive organ damage and death. And, like
only five other families before them, the Bennetts are investing all
hope for saving his life in an experimental stem-cell transplant here
at Duke University Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   From different corners of the nation, these families have found
each other and formed tight bonds. They've read each other's Internet
diaries, compared their children's progress, prayed for a full
recovery and even bought each other strollers and blankets.</LD>
<TE>   As doctors try to stretch medicine's frontier to find a cure, the
families in this group can understand each other's misery and joy
like no one else.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like we're all [one] family now," said Alicia Bennett of
Ione, Calif., as she braced herself for 3-year-old Tommy's
transplant. "It's not 'Oh that kid.' ... He's one of ours."</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts have more than their share of worries. Their two
older children, Ciara, 6, and Hunter, 4, also have Sanfilippo, and
are too disabled to undergo the transplant. If the disease takes its
usual course, they almost certainly will die by their early teens.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the photo montage on Tommy's hospital door includes pictures
of other children: Andrew Bowman, the second Sanfilippo child to
receive a stem-cell transplant, and Jillian Fitzpatrick, who received
her transplant Thursday, a day before Tommy's.</TE>
<TE>   This network didn't exist when Bernadette Gray's 6-year-old
daughter, Julia, underwent her stem-cell transplant in February 2001.
Julia was the first Sanfilippo child in the nation to receive the
experimental procedure, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to know of somebody else who had been
through it," said Julia's mother, who lives in Atlanta. "It was just
the fear of the unknown."</TE>
<TE>   Sanfilippo children lack an enzyme needed to break down chains of
sugar molecules. Over time, these molecules build up, which causes
the severe organ damage.</TE>
<TE>   Sanfilippo and other rare diseases often leave victims and their
families feeling "very isolated because they don't know anybody else
with the disease. They've never met anybody else with it," said Abbey
Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare Disorders,
which keeps a database of 1,100 rare diseases on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go to your corner church and go to a support group
meeting for arthritis or cancer, but you can't with rare diseases."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, these people increasingly are using the Internet and
other means to seek each other out.</TE>
<TE>   Networking has some drawbacks, some families and doctors say.
Parents tend to compare their children's progress, and when one child
suffers a setback, other families become paranoid that their children
will too.</TE>
<TE>   "In some respects, ignorance was bliss," Gray said of being first.
"We weren't as concerned because we didn't know any better."</TE>
<TE>   But the Bennetts and other families say they want to know the
course of disease in other children and the effects of the transplant
so they are not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say it, but I'm kind of a control freak," said
Fitzpatrick, Jillian's mother. "It helps me to know."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick said she's glad that her daughter and Tommy are only
one day apart in the transplant process. She and Tommy's mother
compare notes every day. Jillian, for instance, broke out in hives on
Tuesday from a chemotherapy drug; Tommy's hives came on Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like a clique," said Fitzpatrick, who lives in the
suburbs of Cleveland. "You just instantly feel a connection to them."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick keeps an online diary, detailing Jillian's daily
treatment regimen and voicing fears and hopes. So do the Bennetts and
all of the other Sanfilippo families that have gone through the
transplant process.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Bowman, Andrew's mom, said she talks regularly to the other
families by phone. On her Web site, she keeps a list of children who
could use prayers from others.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Andrew to do well not just for Andrew," his mother said.
"I want Andrew to do well for all the other children and parents who
look at Andrew and say, 'He will be the first one to tell us whether
it is successful or not.' "</TE>
<TE>   Angie Cottey, whose son Kyle had two transplants -- one was
unsuccessful -- said she relies on Bowman to help her through the
process. "When I'm upset and I feel I can't take it any more, I call
her."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Tommy will receive a blood transfusion rich with stem cells
derived from umbilical cord blood, which doctors hope will replace
his deficient cells and produce the enzyme his body is lacking.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say it's too soon to say whether the transplants will
work, as they have for young patients with related diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the transplants are successful, the doctors caution that
the children will never be normal or close to it. And there's a
chance of death and complications during the transplant process.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, director of Duke's pediatric bone-marrow
transplant program, would like to perform the transplant on 15 to 20
Sanfilippo children to fully study its effects.</TE>
<TE>   "If we saw something negative, that would make me reevaluate
whether we should be doing it," she said.</TE>

<LD>Compton Unified school board member Basil Kimbrew will give up his
post next month under an agreement with prosecutors that will allow
him to avoid jail time for lying about his address in a 1999 school
election.</LD>
<LD>   Kimbrew, 49, pleaded no contest Thursday to one count of false
declaration of candidacy, for claiming to live in Compton when he
lived in Carson. He will be ordered to quit Dec. 20, when he is
sentenced to probation with possible community service.</LD>

<HD>Art Imitates Life a Little Too Much When Film Set Is a Fake
Skid Row</HD>
<DH>Merchants say that a homeless encampment built for a TV
show in downtown L.A. was so realistic it scared off potential
customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city's current skid row crackdown seemed too effective Thursday
for merchants and shoppers in one Los Angeles neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   A homeless encampment -- complete with dozens of tents, cardboard
shelters and shopping carts brimming with old clothing, cans and
bottles -- suddenly materialized on a privately owned lot in front of
upscale art galleries and restaurants in the downtown artist
district.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, my God! They're sweeping skid row and they've swept the
homeless into here," said Jonathan Jerald, a documentary filmmaker
who lives nearby and is a member of the city's Historic-Cultural
Neighborhood Council.</LD>
<TE>   Police called to the grimy campsite in the 900 block of East 3rd
Street, about nine blocks east of the main skid row area, were
equally puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   Until, that is, they discovered that the encampment was fake --
and was just a film set erected for the Lifetime television network's
show "Strong Medicine."</TE>
<TE>   News that it was all make-believe came too late for hundreds of
art patrons invited Wednesday night to an exhibit of works by artist
Tod Lychkoff at the Asto Gallery. Some took one look at the
encampment and fled.</TE>
<TE>   "I left at 2 p.m. Wednesday after finishing the installation, and
nothing was there. I came back at 6 to open the show, and it looked
like the homeless had moved in. I couldn't believe it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery owner Nash Im said no one was warned that the mock
encampment was coming. "We were all very shocked and upset," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although studios are required to notify businesspeople and
residents before filming, it was unclear Thursday whether such
notices had been issued along 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which
grants film permits, were briefly at the scene early in the day, but
later did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Guido Ganschow, owner of the Cafe Metropol, said the incident was
a setback for merchants, who have worked for more than four years to
turn the neighborhood into a desirable place to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "People coming from the Westside and other places for that gallery
opening went away saying it's a nice gallery and there are cute
restaurants. But they won't be coming back a second time," worried
Ganschow.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of R-23, a Japanese restaurant, said business dropped
off sharply Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to tell customers not to be scared, that it was for a
movie," owner Jake S said.</TE>
<TE>   But the situation was not helped, he said, when a studio truck
that arrived to post the site as a "hot set" blocked the restaurant's
parking area during the lunch hour.</TE>
<TE>   Studio officials posted guards at the phony encampment to keep
real homeless people from moving in. Many had been rousted when
police moved through downtown before dawn Wednesday arresting more
than 130 people, including many ex-convicts suspected of violating
parole. The sweeps continued Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Production workers said 3rd Street filming is scheduled for today.
The prop tents, cardboard and shopping carts will be removed by 9
p.m., they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we weren't as sensitive as we should have been here,"
said Jim Weiss, unit production manager for "Strong Medicine."</TE>
<TE>   He said he never considered using a real skid row encampment for
the filming -- not when his set decorators can produce a realistic
re-creation.</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove Weiss' point, gallery visitor Francis Krahe of
Corona del Mar walked past with several friends and gazed sadly at
the tents.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lot of homelessness in Los Angeles," Krahe said.</TE>

<HD>Tom Coad Just Misses Bid for Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day late.</LD>
<LD>   That was the bad news delivered to Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad's
husband, who had hoped to become one of several candidates running in
January for an open seat on the Orange County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   County Counsel Benjamin de Mayo issued an opinion Thursday saying
that in order for Tom Coad to qualify as a candidate, his voter
registration form had to have been mailed and postmarked by last
Saturday. Tom Coad said he put the form, showing a new address in the
3rd District, in the mail Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Elections officials said they received it Thursday -- postmarked
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coad said he wouldn't challenge the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   He blamed his missed opportunity on Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
abruptly resigned this week. That pushed up the date of the election
-- and the residency requirement for candidates to run. Had Spitzer
stayed on the job until Dec. 2, when he will be sworn into the state
Assembly, Tom Coad would have had another week to re-register.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed that Supervisor Spitzer used a calculated
trick to thwart my candidacy," Tom Coad said. "I'm so disgusted and
disillusioned with the Machiavellian methods that some political
people think are so clever. I hope citizens will realize that there
are morally bankrupt people in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer was in San Diego attending a retreat for Republican
Assembly members and couldn't be reached for comment. When he
resigned Tuesday, he said he was leaving early because he couldn't
devote enough time to his county job while preparing for his new role
in the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coad announced a month ago that he would run to replace
Spitzer. The Coads live in west Anaheim but are building a home in
North Tustin. The house isn't ready for occupancy, so Tom Coad
registered at a neighbor's guest house to satisfy the residency
requirements. Other candidates include 71st District Assemblyman Bill
Campbell, whom Spitzer is replacing, and Orange Councilman Michael
Alvarez.</TE>

<LD>Now nobody's happy.</LD>
<LD>   After years of hand-wringing and debate over the future of the
stately Algodones Dunes, government officials in the southeastern tip
of California said Thursday that they will attempt to rein in lawless
free-for-alls at perhaps the most popular spot in the dunes for
off-road enthusiasts.</LD>
<LD>   The Imperial County Board of Supervisors said it has established a
sunset-to-sunrise curfew at a destination known as Competition Hill,
south of California 78. The curfew, which is already bringing howls
of protest from both the off-road-vehicle community and environmental
advocates, goes into effect immediately. Violating the curfew could
bring misdemeanor charges and six months in jail.</LD>
<TE>   The overnight restrictions were imposed just before Thanksgiving,
which in recent years has brought huge crowds to "Comp Hill" and
surrounding dunes in the Algodones system, which stretches nearly 40
miles from the Chocolate Mountains to the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Each year around Thanksgiving, as many as 200,000 off-roaders and
spectators have created something of a Woodstock in pickup trucks,
particularly around Competition Hill. Authorities say the gathering
has become increasingly hazardous, in particular to law enforcement
officers who try to impose some order.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the holiday weekend was over last year, three people
were dead and more than 200 injured, authorities said. There were
scores of crashes, a shooting and an attack on a ranger. According to
county records, law enforcement officers were surrounded at one point
by "thousands of unruly recreationists threatening physical harm."</TE>
<TE>   Similar gatherings are held around other holidays, and this year's
Halloween crowd reached 75,000. That led to concerns that this year's
Thanksgiving party could be bigger and more unruly than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "There are assaults and vehicles damaged and all kinds of
problems," said Imperial County Sheriff Harold Carter. "And then,
when law enforcement tries to step in, the crowd turns on them. It
makes it difficult to maintain the peace. It's just not worth the
effort. Public safety mandates this."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, the politics and emotions surrounding Competition
Hill have become almost as complicated as those on Capitol Hill. The
Board of Supervisors' decision has outraged off-road enthusiasts, who
are embroiled in a bitter dispute with environmentalists about
whether their high-tech, high-powered dune buggies and motorcycles
damage the rare ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Seaver, president of the American Sand Assn., which promotes
off-road recreation, said enthusiasts should have been at the
negotiating table all along.</TE>
<TE>   The parties give the normally law-abiding community a bad name,
and families end up paying the price, he said. The dunes have become
one of the prime exhibits for those who believe government agencies
are putting public land off-limits to the public, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no input in this," he said. "Even a curfew is a closure."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, meanwhile, have fought for years to protect
land inhabited by albino grasshoppers and the Peirson's milk vetch,
an endangered plant that features large pods whose seeds rattle in
the breeze. Vehicles are killing these and other rare plants and
animals that live only on the dunes, environmental organizations
argue.</TE>
<TE>   The conservation groups seemingly would be thrilled with the new
restrictions. Not so.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on
Wednesday, the Idyllwild-based Center for Biological Diversity said
it was a dangerous precedent for a county government to make land-use
decisions on federal property.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is not against them trying to crack down," said
Daniel Patterson, a desert ecologist at the center. "Our problem is
that a county ordinance has had an immediate effect on federal land.
Federal land-management decisions should be made and put into effect
by federal agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have essentially ceded Competition Hill to
off-road enthusiasts because damage there is so heavy, Patterson
said. The ban on nighttime use at Comp Hill, he said, will simply
encourage people to spread to new areas, where they will do more
damage.</TE>
<TE>   "That place has been completely destroyed," he said. "So let them
tear it up. They can't tear it up any more than they already have."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, meanwhile, remains at something of an
impasse while weighing the future of the dunes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has proposed overturning a Clinton-era
legal settlement that bans off-road vehicles on about 50,000 acres of
the dunes. The Bureau of Land Management wanted the plan in place by
this fall but needs a sister agency to sign off on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however, according to agency
documents, is considering issuing a "jeopardy opinion" saying,
effectively, that the bureau's plan to reopen portions of the dunes
could doom the milk vetch.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM supports the plan to ban use of Comp Hill from sunup to
sundown, said Stephen Razo, a spokesman at the Riverside-based
California Desert District Office.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the thorny politics, County Supervisor Wally Leimgruber
said that the curfew is the right move -- and that the county has
jurisdiction. Leimgruber himself has ridden dune buggies there, and
frequently hikes and camps nearby. Last year around Thanksgiving, he
waded into the fray -- and helped rescue a man who was being beaten
by a mob.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the county may tinker with the ordinance to make clear
that it will be applied only on busy holiday weekends, Leimgruber
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an element that chooses to come to Imperial County and
engage in lawless activity," he said. "We simply will not tolerate
it."</TE>

<HD>EIDC Chief Facing Removal</HD>
<DH>Councilwoman Greuel says she has the votes to oust Cody
Cluff, who vows to hold on to job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry and Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said Thursday that she has
enough support on the executive committee of the Entertainment
Industry Development Corp. to force Cody Cluff, the film permitting
agency's beleaguered president, to take a paid leave of absence.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a duty and a responsibility to take action," Greuel said.
"I strongly believe I have all the votes necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the position that I have taken, and the one that [the
executive committee] will take tomorrow, is needed in looking to the
future of this organization and its ability to operate," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the councilwoman, along with Mayor James K. Hahn and
county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, called for Cluff to go on leave
until his legal difficulties were resolved. The three elected
officials are on the 11-member executive committee, which is
scheduled to meet today to discuss Cluff's fate and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining members of the committee refused to reveal how they
would vote, although Supervisor Mike Antonovich and City Councilman
Alex Padilla said earlier this month that no action should be taken
until two pending studies are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff has said he would not step down, and Thursday he reiterated
his intention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to stay the course and see the audit through," he said,
referring to a pending study ordered by the executive committee. "I
don't feel that I should take a voluntary leave of absence. I don't
think that's appropriate at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff has been president of the EIDC since it was formed in 1995
to streamline city and county permitting procedures for film and
television productions, and to promote Los Angeles County to the
entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff is under criminal investigation for allegedly misusing EIDC
funds through lavish spending and political contributions to elected
officials, including members of the board of directors and executive
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Greuel nor Yaroslavsky has received EIDC campaign
contributions, although individual staff members gave $5,400 to
Greuel's campaign. Hahn received $1,000 during his mayoral campaign
from EIDC staff members and $2,000 from the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of Cluff's fate is expected to take place behind
closed doors, but the committee's final decision will be announced
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff has argued that under the organization's bylaws, the full
49-member board, not the executive committee, has the power to remove
him. The full board meets only once a year, usually in January.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said that she is asking the executive committee to only put
him on a leave of absence, not to remove him.</TE>
<TE>   She said Cluff should have either resigned or taken a leave of
absence long before now.</TE>
<TE>   "It is necessary and long overdue," said Greuel, a former
executive at DreamWorks. "People in the entertainment industry
believe this organization provides a critical service, and their
concern is that the more we delay putting Mr. Cluff on leave, the
less credibility this organization will have."</TE>
<TE>   "We have every right and a responsibility to ask for an
administrative leave," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Cluff's lawyer, George Newhouse, accused Greuel, Hahn
and Yaroslavsky of violating their contractual responsibilities as
corporate board members to protect the EIDC when they urged Cluff to
step aside.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans 'Loan' of River Water to Farmers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as the U.S. Department of Interior pushes California to rein in
its use of Colorado River water, agency officials said Thursday that
they may boost water supplies to farmers in the state who depend on
the river to irrigate their crops.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, if approved by Interior Secretary Gale Norton, would
likely send between 150,000 and 225,000 acre-feet of water from Lake
Mead on the Colorado to farmers in the Imperial Valley and
southeastern California. That's on top of the approximately 800,000
acre-feet of surplus water that Southern California already takes
from the river each year.</LD>
<LD>   That 800,000 acre-feet is enough to supply the city of Los Angeles
with water for a year.</LD>
<TE>   "When the Bureau of Reclamation informed water users in Nevada,
Arizona and California of this year's water supply [on the Colorado],
the other states adjusted their water use and California asked for
more," said Bennett Raley, an Interior Department assistant
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by Interior comes as negotiations continue on a
complex deal to transfer some of Imperial Valley's rights to Colorado
River water to the San Diego County Water Authority. The deal is seen
as important because it helps reduce Southern California's reliance
on the Colorado -- which must occur soon, as the region is scheduled
to lose its right to take surplus river water after 2015.</TE>
<TE>   But the new loan of water, in effect, means that the region is not
cutting its use of the Colorado, but rather increasing it. That
troubles environmentalists, who say it only encourages further
profligate use of the river's water by farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "When the water users ask Interior for water, they get it, and
when we ask for water for the environment, we don't," said Pamela
Hyde, executive director of Southwest Rivers, based in Flagstaff,
Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District, which will likely be the largest
recipient of the new loaned water, is the only one of four concerned
water agencies that has not yet backed the water transfer deal. A
vote on the transfer by the district's board is scheduled for next
month.</TE>
<TE>   Interior officials want the transfer to go through, but they said
that approving the water loan for the Imperial Valley is not intended
to influence the board's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Raley and other Interior officials said that a three-year drought
has had a severe impact on all California water users and that the
department is in a difficult position -- it desperately wants to see
the state cut its usage but also doesn't want to see farmers lose
their crops.</TE>
<TE>   Raley also said the Interior Department is setting up a program
that will account for any surpluses farmers take, and that farmers
will be expected to "pay back" the loan by reducing water demand in
coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Hull of the Imperial Irrigation District said the loan
continues a tradition of helping farmers at the end of a dry year.</TE>
<TE>   "We get three inches of rain in a normal year and, when you don't
get that, you're short," Hull said. "We're not asking for more; we're
just asking for the water we've always had."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Hitches L.A.'s Wagon to Two Stars</HD>
<DH>Schwarzenegger and Dodger Ishii aid the bid for a 3% rise
in Japanese travel to the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn used star power here Friday in an
effort to lure Japanese tourists back to Southern California and
reverse a decline that has cost the city millions of dollars since
Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   With Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii at
his side, Hahn unveiled a publicity and promotional campaign aimed at
increasing travel from Japan by 3% in the coming year. If that
happened, about $12 million would be added to the city's economy,
city officials said.</LD>
<LD>   As part of that campaign, the city is offering up to 30 Japanese
residents the chance to win a free trip to Los Angeles in a campaign
dubbed "See My L.A." It is a Web-based promotion (www.lax.or.jp)
designed to attract interest from tour operators and Japanese
residents.</LD>
<TE>   But the real draw Friday may have been Ishii. Speaking in
Japanese, the shy, charismatic pitcher told the crowd that L.A. "is a
wonderful and beautiful and delightful place to be. If you are in Los
Angeles, you are in the No. 1 city in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   About 70 members of the Japanese media descended on the normally
sedate Imperial Hotel, cameras clicking as Ishii and Schwarzenegger
played right to them.</TE>
<TE>   The film star, recalling his many visits to Tokyo in the last 30
years, said: "I have to admit it to you, today I am here for the most
important reason: the promotion of my favorite city in the world, Los
Angeles. I mean, it is absolutely mind-blowing how rich an experience
it is to come to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Before the news conference, L.A. officials showed a splashy video
about the city that included a stretch limousine by the beach, girls
in bathing suits, USC cheerleaders and the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn sought to assuage tourists' fears about visiting America. "As
a traveler myself, I feel more secure today than I did a year ago,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment industry officials in Los Angeles said
Schwarzenegger has become a bigger star in Japan than at home, with
his most recent movies making more money here than in the U.S. His
latest film, the third in his Terminator series, is expected to be a
huge hit in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   For Schwarzenegger, then, the trip is valuable for several
purposes: It gives him an opportunity to do a good turn for Los
Angeles, to promote his new film and to make an international
appearance at a time when some are speculating that he will run for
governor of California in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Although Schwarzenegger is a Republican and Hahn a Democrat,
political considerations took a back seat Thursday to tourism. Hahn
flew from Beijing to Tokyo for the news conference to accommodate
Schwarzenegger's schedule, and the mayor will return to China today
for meetings in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn even turned down a chance to meet with Jiang Zemin, China's
recently retired chief of the Communist Party, so he could make the
quick trip to Tokyo. (The meeting with Jiang had been set for earlier
in the week, but Chinese officials had to change it and they wanted
to reschedule it for Friday.)</TE>
<TE>   This is the mayor's sixth day of a 10-day Asia trip designed to
boost tourism, encourage trade and open business opportunities for
Los Angeles companies. He is traveling with City Council President
Alex Padilla and council members Eric Garcetti and Janice Hahn -- the
mayor's sister -- as well as a delegation of business executives and
other city officials. The mayor has already been to Seoul and
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   He spent a busy day in Tokyo, meeting with the heads of two major
Japanese airlines and then attending a meeting with Japan's leading
business organization, Nippon Keidanren, and part of the mayor's
delegation to discuss possible relationships between Los Angeles and
other parts of the Pacific Rim. The mayor was to dine with
Schwarzenegger, along with Japanese tour operators and airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has a particularly important stake in Japanese
tourism. The city is the second-most popular destination, after
Hawaii, for Japanese visitors to the U.S. More people visit Los
Angeles from Japan than from anywhere else overseas.</TE>
<TE>   But those tourists' numbers have dropped since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The tourism slump represents a serious weakness in L.A.'s economy,
according to the mayor and other city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Contreras of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
who is also on the Asia trip, said the city cannot support jobs in
hotels and other industries without boosting tourism.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
showed that the sluggish economy, coupled with fears of terrorism,
has cost Los Angeles nearly $2 billion in spending by international
visitors and 34,000 tourism-related jobs over two years.</TE>

<HD>As Body Count Rises, Top Man in Blue Pitches for Green</HD>

<LD>Six days, 16 bodies, and blood runs hot in the streets of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   What to do?</LD>
<LD>   You won't find any answers from Mayor Jim Hahn. He's in China,
lobbying for a couple of pandas. Hahn might not be able to deliver
the bears, we're told. But he did deliver a new chief of police a
month ago, and it hasn't taken Bill Bratton long to take control of
the city in Hahn's absence.</LD>
<TE>   Get angry, Bratton ordered the entire metropolis this week. Share
his outrage and join the fight to reclaim the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Given the mounting body count, I don't know if we ought to be
encouraging more anger. But whether you like Bratton's swagger or
not, I can't remember anyone getting the whole city to pay attention
to something other than a Laker trophy run.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe our Rust Belt import still hasn't figured out that Los
Angeles is a far-flung collection of separate worlds.</TE>
<TE>   North of the 10 Freeway, there isn't going to be much
hand-wringing over L.A.'s first-place standing in the national murder
derby unless the next corpse turns up at one of those Hollywood
cocktail parties that Bratton's been crashing.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's my take. But Bratton says he expects to enlist
every last one of us in his crime-fighting strategy, and his confabs
with the glamorous and the powerful are part of it.</TE>
<TE>   He was ticked off, he said, about an editorial in this paper
mentioning he'd been hobnobbing with Cindy Crawford while the bodies
were piling up a few miles south.</TE>
<TE>   "You think it's a lot of fun sitting with Cindy Crawford?" Bratton
asked.</TE>
<TE>   I can't say. Send me over there to deputize her in the war on
crime and I'll let you know.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm attempting to do is get all those communities angry
about this, and you're correct. It's difficult to do in West L.A. and
up in Brentwood, because they don't experience it. They can slough it
off or shrug it off.</TE>
<TE>   "But what's the headline people are seeing across the nation?
L.A., Murder Capital. Investors won't come here, businesses won't
locate here."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so we all have a stake in it, economically if not morally. But
I still wasn't clear on Cindy Crawford's role as a crime-fighter
until Bratton said the magic word.</TE>
<TE>   Money.</TE>
<TE>   He's going to hit her up, and the same goes for a lot of other
celebs and high-rollers, some of whom, I might add, make obscene
stacks of cash on violent entertainment in a city where parents are
afraid to let their children walk to the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton even used the term "Brentwood set" in naming likely
targets. My guess is that he's going to either charm them out of
their walking-around money or keep talking long enough that they'll
write a check just to make him go away.</TE>
<TE>   The ghost of Jack Webb and 300 of L.A.'s finest couldn't convince
me that Broadway Bill finds hanging out with celebs a tedious but
necessary part of his job. I'd even wager that he figures he's a
bigger celebrity than half the Botoxers he's eating tiny sandwiches
with.</TE>
<TE>   But the money isn't for him. It's for programs he says will get at
the root causes of violence. Education, counseling, gang
intervention. Bratton says he can't stop crime from the back end when
it's already too late. And he can't stop crime without an escort.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go after gangbangers, but I don't want to go in there
alienating the community with insensitivity and unfocused
enforcement," he said, telling me he's met for hours with community
leaders in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They want us to come in. But while they have a fear of gangs,
they also have a fear of us, and we need to get rid of that fear. The
only way to do it is ... through all this cooperation and meetings,
listening and learning."</TE>
<TE>   One idea Bratton wants to steal is Baltimore's "Believe" program,
a privately funded advertising campaign aimed at uniting the city to
address its problems and celebrate its successes.</TE>
<TE>   I'm told by my Baltimore sources that Believe is more show than
substance, but Bratton thinks it could be part of the solution in
L.A.. It's also the kind of thing you or anyone else can make a
donation to if Cindy Crawford is too tight to cover the entire cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It reaches out to all factions, rich and poor," Bratton said.
"The business community went crazy because there were ads on TV with
dead bodies, people shooting up. But you force people to face up to
the reality.... It seeks to rally the city around the cause, and the
idea that you can make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Can Bratton?</TE>
<TE>   I don't know. Talk is cheap, and it's too soon to know whether
he's a guy who mends fences or starts fires. A lot of people thought
his call to anger was out of line, saying decent people have been
both angry and scared for years in places where bullets fly every
night, often taking the lives of innocents.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton is the first guy I've heard talk to residents of this
city as if they ought to care about something in a neighborhood other
than their own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about rebuilding trust between police and the community," he
said. "We need that same idea of trust between the Korean and black
community, which still has open wounds because of the riots; we need
trust between whites and blacks and Hispanics. Trust between all of
us.</TE>
<TE>   "We can make this the safest city in America, and that might sound
pie in the sky, but it's stuff I sincerely believe in."</TE>
<TE>   One month in town, and he already sounds more like the mayor than
the mayor.</TE>

<HD>No More Delays for Rape Suspect</HD>
<DH>Judge dismisses attempts by attorneys to push back trial
for cosmetics heir Andrew Luster, accused of drugging and assaulting
three women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, lawyers for date-rape suspect Andrew Luster have accused
Ventura County prosecutors of hiding evidence that could exonerate
their wealthy client, and demanded more time to build their case
before trial.</LD>
<LD>   But time has run out.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley this week issued a
blunt ruling, denying a defense request to postpone the trial and
warning lawyers they will be held in contempt if they fail to show up
for jury selection on Dec. 3.</LD>
<TE>   The judge rejected half a dozen defense motions, including one to
suspend the proceedings to give defense lawyers time to fight his
rulings before an appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense has had well over one year to have the motions heard
and seek appellate relief in the event the motions were denied,"
Riley wrote in a five-page ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the 38-year-old great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max
Factor, is accused of raping three women after rendering them
unconscious with the so-called date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate,
or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported
being drugged at a Santa Barbara bar and raped at his Mussel Shoals
beach house.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of the home, detectives found videotapes that
allegedly depict Luster engaging in sex acts with two other
unconscious women.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend Luster has been framed by the Ventura
County sheriff and district attorney. They suggest the tapes have
been altered and the witnesses coached to lie.</TE>
<TE>   They have told Riley that delays in the case can be attributed to
prosecutors refusing to turn over tapes, photographs and other
evidence that could support those allegations.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing last week, Los Angeles attorney Richard G.
Sherman said the defense still is missing items and cannot go forward
until they are provided.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman also maintained that some tapes that have been provided
appear to have been "substantially altered," and requested at least
two more months to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold denied the allegations and accused
the defense of stalling.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be absolutely clear that this defendant does not want
to go to trial," Wold said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he wants to force us to trial," Sherman responded. "But I
want a chance to defend the case.... Mr. Luster is an innocent man
who has been framed."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman and co-counsel Roger Jon Diamond asked Riley to hold a
hearing so they could present evidence to show Wold has lied and
should be held in contempt of court.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling this week, Riley refused to grant the hearing. "This
defense motion has no basis in fact," he wrote. "The allegations
against Mr. Wold are without merit."</TE>

<HD>4th Man Convicted in Death of Valley Teen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months after he was acquitted of kidnapping, a 19-year-old
Goleta man was found guilty of murder for his role in the
execution-style slaying of West Hills teen Nicholas Markowitz.</LD>
<LD>   Graham Pressley was the fourth man convicted in Santa Barbara
County Superior Court in connection with the abduction and fatal
shooting of the 15-year-old in August 2000. The fifth suspect and
alleged mastermind, Jesse James Hollywood, has evaded authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Following a monthlong trial, a jury found Pressley guilty
Wednesday of second-degree murder and for use of an assault weapon.
Another jury in a separate trial in July had deadlocked on the murder
charge but acquitted Pressley of kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Pressley faces 18 years to life in prison, said Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Ron Zonen. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Jan.
15.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon is expected to
decide whether Ryan Hoyt, 23, of West Hills, should be executed for
his role in Markowitz's death. Hoyt was convicted last year of
shooting Markowitz nine times at a remote camping area near Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Zonen said Pressley chose the site where Markowitz would be killed
and dug a shallow grave to place his body in. Later that night,
authorities say Pressley led Markowitz, who was bound and gagged, and
others back to the campsite.</TE>
<TE>   Two other men were sentenced in September in connection with the
crime. Jesse Rugge, 22, of Santa Barbara was found guilty of
kidnapping for ransom and sentenced to life. William Skidmore, 22, of
Simi Valley was ordered to serve nine years after he pleaded guilty
to kidnapping and robbing Markowitz.</TE>

<DH>Prosecutors describe defendant's alleged slayings of woman
and father. Defense denies one, says other was self-defense or
accident.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after he strangled his girlfriend in her bedroom, prosecutors
said Thursday, Matthew Marky fatally shot his Emmy Award-winning
father as the older man sat in his backyard drinking beer. Marky then
went next door and tried to shoot a roommate in the Reseda house they
shared, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   But defense attorney James E. Blatt accused another roommate,
prosecution eyewitness Ricky Schaffer, of strangling 47-year-old
Maria Ruiz-Smeriglio on Aug. 5, 2001, and said Marky had shot his
father in self-defense after the older man took a shot at the son.</LD>
<LD>   Blatt described the household in the 18900 block of Valerio Street
where Ruiz-Smeriglio, Marky and Schaffer lived as one "literally
consumed in drug addiction," in which brawls and threats were
commonplace. He said the three were high on drugs and alcohol on the
day of the killings.</LD>
<TE>   Marky is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with the
special circumstance of multiple murders, attempted murder and a
weapon violation.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison without
parole. Prosecutors have said that they will not seek the death
penalty against the 33-year-old defendant.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dmitry Gorin said
Marky was furious with Ruiz-Smeriglio when he went into her bedroom
on a Sunday afternoon and strangled her, though he was interrupted by
Schaffer.</TE>
<TE>   When Schaffer was unable to stop Marky, Schaffer drove to the Los
Angeles Police Department's West Valley station to report a crime in
progress but refused to give specific details, such as names or the
house address, Gorin said.</TE>
<TE>   Schaffer, whom Gorin called a "coward" for not doing more to save
Ruiz-Smeriglio's life, left the station without providing adequate
details for the police to respond, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, Marky told a 911 operator that Ruiz-Smeriglio was
unresponsive and might have overdosed on pills and alcohol, Gorin
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until an autopsy was performed a few days later that
authorities learned that Ruiz-Smeriglio had been strangled, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Blatt said that Schaffer had "a very
powerful motive to kill Ms. Ruiz" and that he acted suspiciously on
the day that she was strangled.</TE>
<TE>   Blatt said Ruiz-Smeriglio had answered Schaffer's cell phone a few
days earlier and told his estranged wife that she and Schaffer were
using drugs and having sex as they spoke. It was untrue, Blatt said,
but the conversation enraged Schaffer and his wife</TE>
<TE>   "It is our contention that he did the murder," Blatt said,
referring to Schaffer.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Ruiz-Smeriglio was killed, Blatt said, Marky left the
house to buy liquor and, upon returning, saw Schaffer driving away.</TE>
<TE>   An hour or so later, Marky tried unsuccessfully to wake
Ruiz-Smeriglio and called 911, his attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, after seeing police and emergency vehicles next
door, William Marky asked his son to come into his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   As the father and son sat talking and drinking beer, William
Marky, a Vietnam veteran, went inside to retrieve his favorite
handgun, a .380 Beretta. Blatt said the elder Marky loved the gun and
even slept with it loaded under his pillow.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that Marky shot his father in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Marky intentionally killed his father and hid the
murder weapon, which he wrapped in toilet paper, in Ruiz-Smeriglio's
attic. Gorin said Marky gave police conflicting accounts of the
shooting, at first denying any knowledge of it.</TE>
<TE>   But Blatt said Marky would testify that he had shot his father
either accidentally or in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is scheduled to continue today before Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge John S. Fisher.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 11, Found Safe After Disappearing With a Man She May
Have Met on Chat Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities late Thursday found an 11-year-old Stanton girl who had
last been seen two days earlier leaving her neighborhood with a young
man she may have met through a telephone chat line.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County sheriff's investigators were in the process of
interviewing Bianca "Nelly" Marie Nunez and the detained male
"associate," said sheriff's Lt. Hayward Miller.</LD>
<LD>   The girl appeared not to be injured. She had been returned to
Stanton about 11 p.m. and appeared to be in good physical condition,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, when last seen before her disappearance, Bianca and a
9-year-old friend were in front of their apartment complex on West
2nd Street about 7 p.m. when a male 16 to 18 with a shaved head
pulled up in a blue or black van or sport utility vehicle, said
Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</TE>
<TE>   Her playmate told investigators that Bianca appeared to know the
man and climbed willingly into the passenger seat, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   A leading theory is that she had "a prearranged meeting with
someone she met on a chat line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca shares a two-bedroom apartment with her mother, brother and
sister in a complex that is about a mile from where 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion was abducted in July.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca often logged on to Internet chat rooms and is believed to
have been in contact with teenage boys and men, her family said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said that she also was a regular caller to a popular
Orange County telephone party line and that she had arranged a number
of dates that way.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, 25 uniformed deputies canvassed Bianca's
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 25 sheriff's investigators interviewed witnesses,
including friends, young men she has dated, and family members.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said FBI investigators were examining a friend's
computer that Bianca used regularly.</TE>

<HD>Stanton Girl, 11, Found After 2 Days</HD>
<DH>Child, reported in good physical condition, had last been
seen Tuesday with a man she may have met on chat line.</DH>

<LD>Authorities late Thursday found an 11-year-old Stanton girl who had
last been seen two days earlier leaving her neighborhood with a young
man she may have met through a telephone chat line.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County sheriff's investigators were in the process of
interviewing Bianca "Nelly" Marie Nunez and the detained male
"associate," said sheriff's Lt. Hayward Miller.</LD>
<LD>   The girl appeared not to be injured. She had been returned to
Stanton about 11 p.m. and appeared to be in good physical condition,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, when last seen before her disappearance, Bianca and a
9-year-old friend were in front of their apartment complex on West
2nd Street about 7 p.m. when a male 16 to 18 with a shaved head
pulled up in a blue or black van or sport utility vehicle, said
Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</TE>
<TE>   Her playmate told investigators that Bianca appeared to know the
man and climbed willingly into the passenger seat, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   A leading theory is that she had "a prearranged meeting with
someone she met on a chat line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca shares a two-bedroom apartment with her mother, brother and
sister in a complex that is about a mile from where 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion was abducted in July.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca often logged on to Internet chat rooms and is believed to
have been in contact with teenage boys and men, her family said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said that she also was a regular caller to a popular
Orange County telephone party line and that she had arranged a number
of dates that way.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, 25 uniformed deputies canvassed Bianca's
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 25 sheriff's investigators interviewed witnesses,
including friends, young men she has dated, and family members.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI was examining a friend's computer that Bianca used
regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, the focus of the search shifted to Long Beach,
about 20 miles west of Stanton, after a television news viewer called
authorities to report seeing Bianca about noon at a Wherehouse music
store in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The witness said she was with a man between the ages of 19 and 24,
wearing black pants, a striped shirt and a blue baseball cap with an
"NC" logo.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it was her," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department was not contacted until midnight
Wednesday, 28 hours after Bianca disappeared. The girl's mother,
Diana Ponce, delayed reporting her daughter missing because she said
she was under the impression that the law required her to wait 24
hours, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "A long time ago that was the general rule. But I haven't heard of
anything like that in years. And I don't think [the policy] ever held
true for an 11-year-old girl," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the delay and the lack of details about the driver and
vehicle, the Sheriff's Department did not trigger an Amber alert.
That system was used after a series of high-profile kidnappings
nationwide this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Criteria for issuing Amber alerts vary among jurisdictions. Many
follow three guidelines recommended by the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children: Authorities confirm a child has been
abducted; they believe the circumstances indicate that the child is
in danger of serious bodily harm or death; and there is enough
descriptive information about the child, abductor or the suspect's
vehicle to believe an immediate broadcast alert will help.</TE>
<TE>   "Time is of the essence," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Dorchester, director of operations for the Joyful Child
Foundation, an awareness group launched by Samantha Runnion's mother,
said the use and success of any alert is always going to depend on
the amount of information law enforcement agencies have to work with.
The county's alert system, known as the Child Abduction Regional
Emergency Alert, was credited for the quick arrest of a suspect in
the Runnion case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tool that should be left to the discretion of
whatever agency is doing the investigation," Dorchester said. "We
have a great level of confidence in the Orange County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>

<LD>A man has been arrested in connection with 11 bank robberies that
police said were the work of the "20K Bandit."</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, identified only as David Nguyen, was taken into
custody about 5 p.m. Wednesday in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The bank robber got the nickname because he often asked tellers to
give him $20,000. A $5,000 reward has been offered for his capture,
authorities said.</LD>

<HD>Yorba Linda Fire Expected to Be Fully Contained Today; No

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County fire officials Thursday credited well-prepared Yorba
Linda residents and quick-acting firefighters with successfully
battling an erratic, fast-moving brush fire that could have caused
much more damage than it did.</LD>
<LD>   "The cooperation of the community gave us a very big benefit and
paid a very big dividend," said Dennis Shell of the Orange County
Fire Authority.</LD>
<LD>   By late Thursday, he said, the fire -- which started about 7:30
p.m. Wednesday on Yorba Linda's Blue Gum Drive -- had burned 476
acres of grassland, all but 68 of them in Chino Hills State Park. The
fire was 80% contained, with full containment expected by 8 a.m.
today.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of the fire is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 Yorba Linda homes were threatened by the blaze; Shell
said the fire burned to within a few hundred feet of some but none
was damaged.</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter, airlifted off a hillside Wednesday for treatment
of heat exhaustion and dehydration, was in stable condition Thursday
at UCI Medical Center, Shell said.</TE>

<HD>Brush Fire in Yorba Linda Misses Homes</HD>
<DH>Blaze is expected to be fully contained early today. Its
cause is under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County fire officials Thursday credited well-prepared Yorba
Linda residents and quick-acting firefighters with successfully
battling an erratic, fast-moving brush fire that could have caused
much more damage than it did.</LD>
<LD>   "It could have been a lot worse," said Dennis Shell, a spokesman
for the Orange County Fire Authority. "The cooperation of the
community gave us a very big benefit and paid a very big dividend."</LD>
<LD>   About 30 Yorba Linda homes were threatened by the blaze; Shell
said the fire burned to within a few hundred feet of some, but none
was damaged.</LD>
<TE>   By late Thursday, he said, the fire -- which started about 7:30
p.m. Wednesday on Yorba Linda's Blue Gum Drive -- had burned 476
acres of grassland, all but 68 of them in Chino Hills State Park. The
fire was 80% contained, with full containment expected by 8 a.m.
today.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire -- listed as "incendiary" -- is under
investigation. "That's a real broad stroke of the brush," Shell said.
"We don't know if it was intentionally set or accidental."</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the fire -- with Santa Ana winds gusting up to 35
mph and temperatures exceeding 80 degrees -- the blaze was highly
unpredictable, he said. "The wind we had [Wednesday] night was what
we all feared," Shell said. "It was very erratic and dangerous. The
flames, in some areas, were 30 feet high, [posing] a big danger to
firefighters and property."</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter, airlifted from a hillside Wednesday for treatment
of heat exhaustion and dehydration, was in stable condition Thursday
at UCI Medical Center, Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The brush clearance, greenbelts and noncombustible roofs played a
key role in our not having any homes damaged or destroyed," Shell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many homeowners, he said, had cleared brush from within 200 feet
of their houses, installed sprinklers or irrigation systems and
removed dead vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't happened everywhere, officials say. In Newport Coast,
for instance -- a development of 2,600 expensive homes annexed this
year by Newport Beach -- a large number of properties are out of
compliance with county and local regulations requiring fire buffer
zones.</TE>
<TE>   "No one received an A," said Dave Kiff, Newport Beach assistant
city manager. "There were a few Bs and Cs and a lot of Ds."</TE>
<TE>   The development, built after the 1993 Laguna Beach wildfires that
burned 14,000 acres and destroyed 347 structures, was designed with
"fuel modification zones" to interrupt a fire's fuel supply and
provide space for firefighting operations.</TE>
<TE>   The zones are supposed to be maintained by the development's 25
homeowners associations, Kiff said. The associations are being
encouraged to bring them up to code, he said.</TE>

<HD>How to Commemorate the Precipitous Tumble of the Once-Great
Lakers?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the Lakers won their third straight NBA title earlier this year
-- hailed as a "Three-peat" -- I got carried away. I asked readers to
submit phrases to describe the fourth consecutive title that the team
would surely win this season. Submissions included "U-4-ia," "Four
Peat's Sake," "Four Score" and "Quat-Row" (a little bilingual touch
there).</LD>
<LD>   Alas, the Lakers have opened the season by losing nine of their
first 12 games while displaying the worst shooting percentage in the
NBA. They obviously are not going to win the title, even if Shaquille
O'Neal and his sore toesy return. Anyone got an idea for a phrase to
commemorate the fall of this once-great team?</LD>
<LD>   Four-gone, I guess, is a good beginning.</LD>
<TE>   Home furnishings for the daring (see accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   * A piece of meat that you can read by (from M. Wright of
Pasadena).</TE>
<TE>   * Some vegetable-flavored furniture (Susan Felice of Manhattan
Beach).</TE>
<TE>   * An offer that might give you pause, depending on what "fairly
new" means (Jolene Collins of Tujunga).</TE>
<TE>   * An unusual chair-bed combination (Randi Hutchinson of Santa
Monica).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally a speedy sofa set (John Strawway of Encino).</TE>
<TE>   Actors and other waiters: I mentioned that I don't mind being
served by would-be actors in restaurants as long as they're playing
the part of good waiters.</TE>
<TE>   In "Dream Palaces," a study of star mansions, author Charles
Lockwood recalls a joke that comedy star Fatty Arbuckle played on
Paramount Pictures boss Adolph Zukor during a dinner party in 1919.
Arbuckle hired funnyman Buster Keaton, then an unknown actor, to play
a clumsy server at Arbuckle's West Adams Boulevard estate in 1919.</TE>
<TE>   Keaton began by delivering shrimp to the men first, then to the
women. Upbraided by Arbuckle, Keaton simply scooped up all the men's
shrimp -- even half-eaten pieces -- and gave them to the women. Then
Keaton repaired to the kitchen, where he made clattering noises
indicating that he had dropped the soup tureen on the floor. His
uniform drenched, he emerged to remove all the soup bowls from the
dinner table without saying a word.</TE>
<TE>   For his coup de grace, Keaton dropped a roast turkey on the dining
room floor, at which point the screaming Arbuckle chased him out of
the house. Zukor was later let in on the joke and the guests were
given a real meal.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Laker fans are in a bad mood these days. During the
postgame show on KLAC-AM (570) radio Wednesday night, a grumbling
caller was told that if he correctly answered a trivia question, he
would win two free tickets to the team's game Sunday. "I don't want
to go to the game," he snapped.</TE>

<LD>Pharmacist Daniel Hancz knows all about the foreign-made medications
sold without prescriptions at outdoor swap meets, party supply stores
and butcher shops.</LD>
<LD>   He assists other members of Los Angeles County's Health Authority
Law Enforcement Task Force in an effort to stop over-the-counter
sales of the potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals, some of which are
banned in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent raid, Hancz and other task force members confiscated
prescription drugs labeled in Spanish from two botanicas near
downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Among the illicit items they seized in the raid last Friday was a
small round case of penicillin cream. For someone who is allergic to
penicillin, just a touch, officials said, could cause a severe
reaction, even death.</TE>
<TE>   Health officers and sheriff's deputies also removed vials of
ready-to-inject penicillin and a 1-liter bottle of a vitamin mixture
prepared for infusion from Botanica Guacamu on West 3rd Street near
Vermont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were cited Friday at four separate Los Angeles
storefronts for allegedly dispensing dangerous drugs without a
license, a misdemeanor offense.</TE>
<TE>   The task force, known as HALT, has seized an estimated $5 million
worth of illegal pharmaceuticals, mostly in immigrant communities,
during its nearly three-year existence, said Donald Ashton, the
deputy health officer in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found these illicit pharmacies everywhere, from South Bay
to Lancaster, from East Los Angeles to Santa Monica," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the medications are manufactured in other countries with
fewer government restrictions, officials said. Some drugs commonly
found in the United States, such as vitamins, antibiotics and birth
control, are sold in injection form, which requires a prescription.
Others, like the painkiller Neo-Melubrina, which can harm the immune
system, are banned in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Task force members are assisting police and prosecutors
investigating the death of a 54-year-old Anaheim man, Roberto
Caceres, last month after he allegedly received injections of vitamin
B-12 and the steroid B-Methasone, used to treat allergic disorders,
from two women now charged with involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Ashton said it's impossible to know how many people have become
sick or died from black-market pharmaceuticals. Caceres' death is the
first such reported fatality in L.A. County in about four years, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And four years ago was about the time county Supervisor Gloria
Molina began a campaign to empower county health officers to close
illegal pharmacies and increase the monetary penalties for selling
pharmaceuticals without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   A 13-month-old boy, Christopher Martinez, had died in April 1998
after he received five injections over three days at a storefront in
a Santa Ana strip mall. News reports showed a widespread problem.
Molina said she had not realized until then how many illicit
pharmacies were operating, or how potentially lethal their products
were.</TE>
<TE>   "We were seeing potential disasters appear throughout our
neighborhoods," she recalled. And county officials were almost
powerless to respond.</TE>
<TE>   So Molina asked state legislators for help. Under a 1998 law,
county health officers may now inspect businesses suspected of
selling illegal pharmaceuticals without search warrants, and may call
in law enforcement to seize the contraband.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also increased penalties for sales of illegal
pharmaceuticals. First-time offenders may now be fined up to $5,000
and sentenced to a year in jail; the fine increases to as much as
$10,000 for repeat violations.</TE>
<TE>   To enforce the new law, the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors created the health authority task force in February 1999
as part of its Department of Health Services. The seven-member task
force includes a full-time Los Angeles police officer and three
sheriff's deputies, in addition to Hancz and two health officers. It
has an annual budget of $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Like a drug agent, Ashton measures success by results in the
community. About 350 people have been arrested, roughly 50 of them in
2002, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who didn't know it was against the law or didn't think
they would get caught aren't doing it anymore," Ashton said.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the task force shut down a swap meet booth whose
operator had hung a shower curtain for customer privacy. "Someone
would ask for an injection, go behind the curtain, drop their pants
and get an injection," Ashton said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he cannot speak Spanish, Ashton once made undercover buys
at Latino storefronts. Back then, he said, he could walk into a
botanica, where many of the illegal items were on display, ask for
penicillin and buy it.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, sellers are more sophisticated, hiding their
merchandise in back rooms or, in one instance, inside false walls.
They also are more cautious, asking potential customers for a
reference.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them I don't think are bad people," Ashton said. "I
think some of them actually think they are trying to help."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Caceres had been desperate to get rid of an irritating
rash that doctors had been unable to cure, said his son, Luis
Caceres. He was on the verge of losing his job because he was sick so
often, the son said.</TE>
<TE>   With nowhere else to turn, Caceres sought help from a woman he had
heard about on a popular Spanish-language talk-radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Caceres paid Reina Isabel Chavarria $310 for an initial
consultation. When the pills and ointment she had given him didn't
help, he returned to Chavarria's house Oct. 28 for two injections
that cost $140, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the shots, Caceres went into convulsions and died
minutes later at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities charged Chavarria, 48, and her 28-year-old assistant,
Margarita Montes, both of Van Nuys, with involuntary manslaughter and
practicing medicine without a license in connection with Caceres'
death.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they saw people line up at Chavarria's house in the
15700 block of Marlin Place as early as 4:30 a.m., and they
occasionally complained to police when children were left unattended
in vehicles while adults went inside.</TE>
<TE>   Task force members, who respond solely to complaints, said they
were unaware of Chavarria's business until Caceres died.</TE>
<TE>   Since his death, members have been working with Los Angeles police
detectives and Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Rizzo, who is prosecuting the
case.</TE>
<TE>   At first, authorities had trouble even identifying what substances
had been injected. The bottles were in Spanish and their
English-language equivalencies were not listed in medical reference
books.</TE>
<TE>   Hancz found them in the Mexican edition of the Physicians' Desk
Reference, a popular pharmaceutical reference. He also is providing
other expertise to the prosecution and is expected to testify in the
criminal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   To report illegal pharmaceutical sales, call HALT at (213)
989-7039 and leave a message in English or Spanish. It should include
information about the location of illicit pharmacies and types of
drugs being sold there.</TE>

<HD>Maybe We Shouldn't Hear Those D.A. Tapes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just what do they talk about behind closed doors in the Orange County
D.A.'s office, when their guard is down and they don't know they're
being taped by a mole working for the state attorney general?</LD>
<LD>   If we're lucky, we'll find out soon.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere, unless it's already been eaten by a deputy attorney
general, is a copy of taped conversations involving unknown members
of the staff of embattled Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who must be
pining for his days as a judge when only defense attorneys bugged
him.</LD>
<TE>   Now Rackauckas has found out that a member of his inner circle has
secretly recorded conversations as part of an investigation into the
way Rackauckas is running his office.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant (former lieutenant might become the proper term
soon) is Michael Clesceri, assistant chief of investigations in the
D.A.'s office. For some reason, he agreed to a request from Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer's office to try and get some dirt on Rackauckas.
You have to admit, Clesceri has guts. Or a death wish.</TE>
<TE>   It's not yet known whom Clesceri taped, when he did it or what is
on the tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, no one in the D.A.'s office wants the tapes revealed.
That's because the chatter will turn out to be something
embarrassing, like this:</TE>
<TE>   Male voice: Hey, has anyone seen my briefs? I can't find them
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Female voice: Ha-ha. Never heard that one before. Did you hear ABC
is planning a takeoff on that bachelor show for next year? Instead of
a guy picking from 25 women, they're going to have a woman meet 25
guys and eventually select Mr. Right.</TE>
<TE>   Male: Yeah, and when she picks him, we ought to arrest both of
them on some kind of public indecency charge.</TE>
<TE>   Female: Oh, really. Are you saying that you, a connoisseur of "The
Man Show," don't like "The Bachelor?"</TE>
<TE>   Male: Have you actually made it through an hour of that dreck?
Just your average everyday great-looking, glib, sensitive, successful
phony who makes out with a dozen women in a few weeks, all on camera,
mind you, and then is left with an agonizing decision. Which babe is
he really in love with? How did the California Penal Code miss that
one?</TE>
<TE>   Female: You're the one missing the point. It's Cinderella meeting
the prince. It's a fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   Male: Yeah, Cinderella in designer jeans and painted nails.</TE>
<TE>   Female: So, you think the guy is a dope, too?</TE>
<TE>   Male: No, he's merely a fraud. He does what guys do. Doesn't your
skin crawl when you see the rejected women try to figure out what
went wrong?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see if I can help: They met a guy on TV two weeks ago, they
knew the point of the show is that he wines and dines them on ABC's
tab and acts like he's interested in them so the interest builds and
his final decision is a ratings grabber. Does that clarify it?</TE>
<TE>   Female: I'm sure they know it's all a game.</TE>
<TE>   Male: Oh, and that's why they're sniffling afterward and wanting
to know what went wrong with their perfect soul mate who, by the way,
just came out of a hot tub with the five other finalists. Get a grip.</TE>
<TE>   Female: OK, that's why it's not on PBS. Lighten up. Not every show
has to be about migrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   Male: Hey, now you're onto something! How about a show where a
poverty-stricken migrant farm worker from the Central Valley of
California is introduced to 25 Manhattan socialites and is forced to
pick one as his bride? They could call it "The Bracero."</TE>
<TE>   Female: You're losing it. We have a case to work on.</TE>
<TE>   Male: As soon as I find my briefs. No, seriously.</TE>

<HD>City Considers Curbs on Costly Home Loans</HD>
<DH>Ordinance targets predatory lending practices. Banking
interests voice dissent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With hard work, sacrifice and years of monthly payments, she
purchased a house.</LD>
<LD>   With a few strokes of the pen, she almost lost it.</LD>
<LD>   "I almost had a nervous breakdown," said Hazel Rawal, a
69-year-old grandmother whose lender placed a lien on her house and
threatened her with foreclosure. "I kept praying, Lord ... show me
what to do."</LD>
<TE>   With the help of housing advocates, Rawal kept her house. The
advocates say Rawal was a victim of "predatory lending" --
high-interest, high-fee loans designed, critics say, to send
unwitting homeowners into foreclosure. Experts say lenders appear to
target specific populations -- older people, poor people and minority
homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, cities and states are enacting laws to curb
the practice, and the Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to
consider such a measure today.</TE>
<TE>   "This is terrible stuff," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas. "It is life-altering, manipulative.... We just simply
believe that the city of Los Angeles is duty-bound to protect its
citizens, particularly seniors who are at risk of losing their single
most important asset."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents in the financial services industry have put time and
money into an effort to kill the ordinance. A state law passed last
year makes a local law unnecessary, they say, and will drive lenders
out of communities that need access to capital.</TE>
<TE>   The state law has "brought results," said Victor Franco Jr.,
director of government relations for the Central City Assn. of Los
Angeles, a business group.</TE>
<TE>   Predatory lending describes loans that are often characterized by
exorbitant interest rates, expensive fees and prepayment penalties.
They are offered by subprime lenders, those that service borrowers
who lack the "A" rating needed to borrow from prime lenders. While
not all subprime loans are predatory, many predatory loans are
subprime. Typical borrowers are homeowners who need extra cash.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy, Ridley-Thomas said, is that most of these homeowners
need to borrow only $5,000 to $10,000, but through abusive loan
agreements, end up owing much more. "Once ensnared, the best legal
minds have difficulty disentangling the victim," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates suspect that lenders target would-be borrowers
using databases to learn names, addresses and information on
delinquent taxes -- a clue as to who might be receptive to a pitch
for a loan.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from looking at the data that there are a large number of
census tracts and neighborhoods in Los Angeles that are particularly
plagued by predatory lending practices," said Gary Rhoades,
litigation director of the nonprofit Housing Rights Center. It
appears in Los Angeles "that race and age are two of the criteria
being used."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the calls that have come into a hotline set up by Freddie
Mac, a private mortgage investment company chartered by Congress, and
the city's Housing Department were "from African American senior
citizens who are saying things to us like, ' ... and the next thing I
knew my name was no longer on the deed,' " Rhoades said.</TE>
<TE>   The practice has been the subject of numerous studies conducted by
a range of organizations. A nationwide study by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development found that in 1998, subprime loans
accounted for 31% of refinance loans originated for African
Americans, compared with 12% for Latinos and 11% for Caucasians.</TE>
<TE>   An AARP study found that of borrowers 45 and older, 56% of
mortgages were subprime; for borrowers under 35, only 12% of
mortgages were subprime.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance is supported by a long list of groups, including
unions, churches, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</TE>
<TE>   It also has the backing of Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The law is opposed by the American Financial Services Assn. and
many major banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and
Washington Mutual. Many major banks, while not in the subprime market
themselves, own subsidiaries that are.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the proposed ordinance would:</TE>
<TE>   * Require borrowers to obtain home loan counseling from an
independent advisor.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibit lending unless there was a reasonable belief in the
borrower's ability to repay it.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibit making high-cost refinance loans that do not benefit
the borrower.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting of the City Council's Housing Committee on Wednesday,
several lenders accused the city of moving too quickly on the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Mark T. Harris, an attorney representing American Financial, said
consumer education, not more legislation, will keep people from
becoming victims.</TE>
<TE>   Several other industry representatives, including Jon Eberhardt of
the California Assn. of Mortgage Bankers, warned that lenders would
desert the subprime market in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is bigger than the reward," Eberhardt said.</TE>

<HD>Prince Takamado, 47; Japan Royal Sought 'Normal' Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Prince Takamado, a member of the Japanese royal family known for his
love of sports and efforts to make the closeted imperial system more
accessible to average Japanese, died Thursday. He was 47.</LD>
<LD>   The prince, seventh in line to the throne and a cousin of the
current emperor, collapsed while taking a squash lesson at the
Canadian embassy. According to Japanese media reports, he slumped
over around 4 p.m. and died several hours later of heart failure
after his wife, Hisako, gave permission to have him taken off life
support.</LD>
<LD>   Takamado sought to forge some semblance of a normal life and to
chip away at the institution's highly restrictive traditions,
stifling formality and micro-management -- a goal made easier by his
position relatively far down the line of succession.</LD>
<TE>   He took the subway, had a relatively regular job, enjoyed meeting
people and was known for enjoying down-market restaurants and
low-brow Japanese food such as steamed noodles and stir-fried pork
washed down with a bit of Japanese alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "Our views sometimes differ with those of the Imperial Household
Agency," he told Takanori Kato, a palace reporter with the Yomiuri
Shimbun. "But I'd get into trouble if I spoke about it."</TE>
<TE>   His position as honorary president of the Japan Football Assn. was
a platform for a groundbreaking visit to South Korea for the opening
ceremonies of the World Cup soccer finals six months ago, making him
the first royal family member to travel there since the end of World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   During the trip, he went out of his way to praise South Korean
hospitality, helping ease at least marginally the bitterness between
the two countries arising from Japan's 35-year occupation of Korea
that ended in 1945. "Our two countries, so close geographically but
often so far apart in other ways, are now becoming closer," he told
Koreans on a visit to a fish market in Pusan.</TE>
<TE>   The visit came shortly on the heels of a courageous statement by
Emperor Akihito that the imperial family likely traced its ancestry
to Korea -- something often assumed by scholars but largely stifled
by the watchful Household Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Palace watchers say the prince's everyman instincts were
strengthened in part his three years studying psychology and music
history in Canada, and his family position. His father as a younger
man had bridled under the imperial restrictions as well, while his
being the third son afforded him a bit more freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "In Canada away from the glare of Japan he learned to be more of
an ordinary guy, which he couldn't do back home," said Toshiaki
Kawahara, an independent journalist.</TE>
<TE>   More public duties fell on his shoulders in his 30s as illness
befell his siblings. His eldest brother, Tomohito, was diagnosed with
throat cancer a decade ago while the second son, Yoshihito, was
confined to a wheelchair in the 1980s after a head injury.</TE>
<TE>   Many Japanese, particularly younger people, welcomed his less
formal approach. "He was such an ordinary guy that it was easy to
forget he was part of the royal family," said Chikako Fujiwara, a
31-year-old housewife. "I just thought of him as a cousin of the
emperor."</TE>
<TE>   Takamado served for a time as a magazine columnist, and wrote
regular newspaper dance reviews. He met his wife, Hisako, a commoner
and English interpreter, after he noticed her in 1984 working at the
palace and asked for an introduction. Four months later he proposed
to her in English, making "Will you marry me?" one of the most
popular English expressions with the public that year.</TE>
<TE>   Takamado was, along with his wife, an avid collector of netsuke,
small charm-like objects attached by string to tobacco pouches,
kimono and other objects used from the 17th century to 19th century.
He visited Southern California in 1997 to attend the opening of a
netsuke exhibition at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   An avid sportsman, he loved soccer and played squash regularly.</TE>
<TE>   He also played the cello, enjoyed music and served as president of
Japan's Amateur Musicians' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Tokyo's Gakushuin University and Queen's University
in Canada, Takamado spent his entire working life at the Japan
Foundation, a government-funded organization promoting international
exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Takamado is survived by his wife, Princess Hisako, and their three
daughters.</TE>

<HD>4 Seek to Replace School Recall Target</HD>
<DH>One candidate for Nativo Lopez's seat in Santa Ana is a
former councilman and trustee.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four people, including a former city councilman who also served as a
school trustee, filed candidacy papers Thursday to replace Santa Ana
school board member Nativo Lopez in the event he is recalled in a
special election early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Robert L. Richardson, who served on the school board in the late
1980s before winning two City Council terms in Santa Ana, brings name
recognition and clout to the contest as it heads to a Feb. 4
showdown.</LD>
<LD>   The other candidates are Vivian Martinez, a district mother and
one of the original petitioners to recall Lopez; Cindy Pettus, a
community college instructor; and John Raya, a former boxer who runs
a youth boxing academy in Santa Ana. All four filed Thursday just
hours before the 5 p.m. deadline.</LD>
<TE>   The special election will cost Santa Ana Unified about $100,000,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Voters will decide whether Lopez, who is serving his second
four-year term, should be recalled. They also must choose a
replacement from among the four because both questions must be
answered for a ballot to count, according to the county's registrar
of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's opponents have called him a divisive force in the
community and accused him of promoting bilingual education in
violation of state law in the mostly Latino district of 62,000
students. Lopez, who denies doing anything illegal, says he is being
targeted for defending the rights of Latino students and their
working-class families.</TE>
<TE>   The bitter recall effort colored the regular school board election
earlier this month, as trustees John Palacio and Nadia Maria Davis,
seen as Lopez's allies on the five-member board, also were targeted
by recall supporters. Palacio won reelection, but Davis lost to
former board member Audrey Y. Noji. Two candidates backed by many of
the recall supporters and City Hall leaders, Lupe Moreno and Oscar
Garza, also lost, coming in third and fifth, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, 41, a senior administrative manager for the county and
a Santa Ana planning commissioner, said Thursday that he wants
Lopez's seat because he has become increasingly concerned about the
pace of school construction in the overcrowded district.</TE>
<TE>   The district won a $145-million construction bond in 1999 and is
preparing to build or expand several campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unbelievable that after three years, we have yet to add a
single classroom," said Richardson, a supporter of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez could not be reached for comment Thursday. But he and
Palacio have blamed the pace of construction on a scarcity of land in
Santa Ana. Lopez has also said the recall effort is fueled by
opponents of a proposed new elementary school in the relatively
affluent northern end of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said Thursday that if he were to take over Lopez's
seat, he would call for a review of that proposed school site. "I
don't believe that is where a school is most needed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the plan argue that the new campus will bring
disruptive traffic to their tranquil streets. Lopez says they don't
want low-income Latino children in their neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>Truck Driver Gets 1 Year in Fatal Anaheim Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A truck driver who lost control of his overweight big rig in an
Anaheim Hills intersection last year, killing a popular optometrist
in a 12-vehicle accident, was sentenced Thursday to one year in jail
-- a term family members said was not a fair price for the man who
died.</LD>
<LD>   "I relive that morning," Kenneth Michael Larkin's widow, Annie,
wrote in a letter read during the sentencing. "You have robbed me of
my Michael. You have taken away my very best friend and my love."</LD>
<LD>   Larkin, 53, was killed in the March 8, 2001, accident when Anthony
Robert Saiz's truck -- which was traveling on Imperial Highway with
failing brakes and a load of gravel -- careened down a residential
hill, then barreled through a red light at the Nohl Ranch Road
intersection.</LD>
<TE>   Saiz was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of
methamphetamine and morphine and having a stash of urine from a
family member, which authorities suspected he was carrying to beat a
drug test. Also, his license had expired.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Saiz tearfully apologized to the family. "I'm just so
very sorry to the Larkin family," said Saiz, seated in a wheelchair
and wiping his eyes with his shirt sleeve. "This is something that
will stay with me for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Superior Court Judge John Ryan said the one-year
jail term with five years' probation was the maximum sentence
permitted. He also ordered Saiz to surrender his commercial driver's
license, suspended his driver's license for a year and ordered him to
pay nearly $29,000 in restitution.</TE>
<TE>   "An experienced truck driver should have known there's bad brakes
and an overload," Ryan said. "He should have not been on that road."</TE>
<TE>   Saiz, 48, of Lakewood pleaded guilty in September to vehicular
manslaughter while under the influence of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   During the police investigation, Saiz told officials that he tried
to stop at the light, then waved and hit the horn to alert others.
Police concluded that seven of the eight brakes on his truck, owned
by Peterson Bros. Construction, were faulty and that the load of
gravel exceeded the legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   The accident, near two schools, sparked rallies and outrage from
neighbors who had long complained about speeding trucks. The city of
Anaheim increased police enforcement in the area.Though there was no
dispute that Saiz was driving under the influence, it was ultimately
unclear whether the drugs played a role in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The driver's attorney, Philip Zalewski, said that it was not his
client's responsibility to check the condition of the truck and that
Saiz became a scapegoat as the investigation progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Saiz's family pleaded for leniency. "He pays for this every day,"
said Monique Craig, one of his four children.</TE>
<TE>   Saiz injured his back, legs and knees in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's mother, Laverne Larkin, wrote a letter to the court,
reminding the judge of the price she and other family members paid.</TE>
<TE>   "[Michael] was so badly injured, I [could] only touch his hand at
his viewing."</TE>

<HD>Salvage Logging OKd in Tahoe Wilderness</HD>
<DH>Environmentalists plan to appeal Forest Service decision on
removal of trees that burned last year in roadless area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoffrey Mohan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists vowed to appeal a decision Thursday by the U.S.
Forest Service to allow timber companies to log as much as 2,743
acres of roadless wilderness burned in a forest fire last year.</LD>
<LD>   In all, the Forest Service will allow logging on more than 5,000
acres of Tahoe National Forest that was damaged by the Star fire,
which burned 17,500 acres around the Middle Fork of the American
River in August 2001.</LD>
<LD>   No fire-damaged trees showing any green needles would be felled,
however, and about 80% of the logging of dead trees would be done by
helicopters in an attempt to protect steep slopes and fragile soils,
according to the decision released Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Forty percent of the acreage that burned within Tahoe National
Forest will be protected for wildlife, soil and watershed
protections, including 1,811 acres of habitat for spotted owls and
goshawks, the Forest Service said. But the measure that has drawn the
ire of environmentalists, who have been watching the project closely,
involves allowing salvage logging within roughly 4,300 acres of the
Duncan Canyon Roadless Area, which has been nominated for wilderness
protection.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a Trojan horse," said Brian Vincent, an activist with the
American Lands Alliance in Nevada City, Calif., who vowed to appeal
the plan. "They want to go in and log big trees even if it's by
helicopter. They want to take the largest, most merchantable trees.
It has nothing to do with fuels management."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service, however, said selective logging in the Duncan
Canyon area, which sustained heavy damage in the blaze, would have a
minimal impact, and would help protect it by removing dead wood that
fuels fires.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't preclude any future wilderness designations," said
Richard Johnson, district ranger for the Forest Service's Foresthills
station. "The Forest Service is committed to managing this as a
wilderness area."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson estimated that about 25 million board-feet of timber --
roughly enough to build 1,666 average California homes -- could be
harvested.</TE>
<TE>   "As a person who owns a house, I'd much rather have my house built
from trees that are dead than from cutting green trees," Tahoe
National Forest spokeswoman Ann Westling said in defense of salvage
logging.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service said its aim is to "accelerate the
reestablishment of old-growth forests" and reduce the amount of dead
trees that could fuel a future fire. Timber companies would bid to
harvest the trees, and the Forest Service said it would use some of
the money to restore and replant the forest.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no explicit provision for timber companies to remove
smaller, less commercially viable trees, Westling said. That
material, which fire scientists say provides the most ready fuel for
forest fires, would have to be removed by service contracts or other
means, paid for by the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make any sense from a fire standpoint or a habitat
standpoint, because the bigger trees are what's needed for nesting
birds and those are also the trees that are most fire-resistant,"
said Chad Hanson, director of the John Muir Project, which will
appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the decision will have 45 days to appeal it, after
which they can resort to litigation.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Links Actor, Threat</HD>
<DH>Man claims private eye Anthony Pellicano hired him to
intimidate a Times reporter on behalf of Steven Seagal, the FBI says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Lait and Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man charged with threatening a Los Angeles Times reporter who was
researching the relationship between Steven Seagal and an alleged
Mafia associate told an informant for the FBI that Seagal was behind
the threat, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Proctor, a 59-year-old ex-convict charged with
threatening reporter Anita Busch, allegedly told the informant during
secretly recorded conversations that he had been hired to carry out
the threat by Anthony Pellicano, known as the private detective to
the stars.</LD>
<LD>   According to the FBI, Proctor told the informant that Seagal had
hired Pellicano to threaten the reporter.</LD>
<TE>   "He wanted to make it look like the Italians were putting the hit
on her so it wouldn't reflect on Seagal," Proctor told the informant,
according to a search warrant affidavit filed by an FBI agent
assigned to the case.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, more than a dozen FBI agents searched Pellicano's
West Hollywood office. An FBI spokesman, Matt McLaughlin, said
Pellicano had been arrested in connection with what appeared to be
explosive materials discovered in his office during the search. He is
expected to appear before a federal magistrate today, McLaughlin
said.</TE>
<TE>   One federal law enforcement source close to the case said that "at
this time, other than Proctor's uncorroborated statements, there is
no independent evidence that Seagal was involved in the threat made
to the reporter."</TE>
<TE>   The source added that investigators were still assessing Proctor's
credibility and possible motives.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Seagal said his client had no involvement in the
June 20 threat against the reporter, who woke up that morning and
found a dead fish, a rose and a note attached to her car windshield,
which had been punctured. The note was a one-word message: "Stop."</TE>
<TE>   "This uncorroborated allegation by someone arrested is pure
fiction and is nothing more than a transparent attempt to divert
attention from himself and the real perpetrators," said attorney
Martin R. Pollner, who represents Seagal. "This is part of an
unrelenting campaign to disparage Mr. Seagal and reads like a bad
screenplay."</TE>
<TE>   Before he was handcuffed, Pellicano declined to comment. As a
celebrity sleuth with a star-studded clientele, he has cultivated a
tough-guy image: He hands out paperweights to reporters saying,
"Sometimes ... you just have to play hardball."</TE>
<TE>   Pollner, Seagal's attorney, said it was his understanding "that
Mr. Pellicano and Mr. Seagal aren't even on speaking terms." In fact,
he said, he had been told by his client that Pellicano had been
retained as an investigator in an unrelated civil case against the
actor. Pollner did not identify the case.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor, who was being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center
in downtown Los Angeles without bail, has pleaded not guilty in the
case. His attorney, Victor Cannon, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Proctor told the informant that he
owed Pellicano $14,000 and agreed to intimidate Busch for $10,000.
But after the job was done, Proctor said, "they" were so pleased with
his work that Pellicano agreed to wipe out his remaining debt.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor allegedly told the informant that he was supposed to "blow
up" Busch's car as a warning so she would stop reporting on the story
about Seagal. But he said it would have been too difficult to set her
car ablaze, because she lived near an apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   He said Busch also had a neighbor who stayed up late at night, and
he was apparently afraid he would be seen.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Proctor allegedly told the informant that he bought
the fish and rose and placed them on Busch's car, putting a bullet
hole in the windshield and taping the cardboard sign to it.</TE>
<TE>   After Busch's car was vandalized, she told authorities she thought
the incident was related to her investigative work on an article
about Seagal and his former producing partner, Julius Nasso, who had
a bitter business fallout with the film star.</TE>
<TE>   According to federal authorities, Nasso is an associate of the
Gambino crime family. He was indicted earlier this year, along with
other reputed mob figures, in connection with a plot to extort money
from Seagal. He has pleaded not guilty. Seagal is scheduled to
testify next year as a prosecution witness at the trials of several
alleged mobsters and Nasso in Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Nasso's attorney alleged in a court document that
Seagal might have been involved in the threat against Busch, and that
could reflect on the actor's credibility as a witness.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor's taped statements to the informant are detailed in a
21-page application for a search warrant. Investigators requested
court permission to search Proctor's residence, but a judge denied
the request Oct. 17, a day after Proctor's arrest. There is no
indication in the documents why the request was rejected. One source
said there was technical language that needed to be fixed before the
judge would approve it.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI, the agency's informant was facing criminal
charges of his own, including mail fraud, at the time he agreed to
cooperate with the investigation of Proctor.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Busch's car was vandalized, the informant called the
reporter, saying he knew who was responsible. He said Proctor at that
time told him he had vandalized the car and was working for guys
"back East" who were ruthless and wanted Busch to back off her story.</TE>
<TE>   The informant then agreed to wear a concealed recording device
while trying to coax out more details about the plot from Proctor.</TE>
<TE>   During a July 3 meeting with the informant, Proctor reportedly
said he had actually carried out the threats against Busch on behalf
of Seagal, not ruthless men from back East.</TE>
<TE>   According to the court documents, Proctor talked to Pellicano on
several occasions. There is no indication in the documents that he
ever met with Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Proctor is an ex-convict with burglary
and narcotics-related convictions.</TE>
<TE>   He is charged with interfering with commerce by threats of
violence. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Council Approves Bonds for Low-Cost Housing</HD>
<DH>The city plans to sell $16 million in tax-exempt securities
to finance affordable homes for seniors and lower-income buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Moorpark City Council has backed construction of nearly 200
apartments and homes for low-income senior citizens and other
residents with limited earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Without discussion, council members Wednesday night unanimously
approved the sale of $16 million worth of tax-exempt bonds to aid
financing of Vintage Crest Senior Apartments, a 190-unit,
$22.5-million complex that will offer below-market rents to the
elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Council members also rezoned a city-owned parcel at Millard Street
and Los Angeles Avenue to allow construction of a trio of
three-bedroom houses that the city would buy from the developer to
resell to low- and very-low income buyers.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we are doing a reasonably good job of providing
affordable housing for all segments of the population, from
first-time home buyers up to seniors," Mayor Patrick Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Vintage Crest will substantially increase the number of affordable
dwellings for seniors in Moorpark, said Nancy Burns, a city
redevelopment analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "This project represents a very important ingredient in the
formula we've set out to provide affordable housing in the
community," Assistant City Manager Hugh Riley said. "There's a very
basic need for this."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 30-unit Tafoya Terrace, which serves seniors and
disabled tenants, is the primary project for Moorpark's elderly.
Overall, there are nearly 100 other rental units in two complexes
that have rent restrictions to keep them affordable for tenants of
all ages, Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   In the next five years, Moorpark should build 1,255 more units to
house its share of new residents expected to settle in Ventura
County, according to the county's Council of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 383 would accommodate buyers and renters of moderate
incomes, 155 would target those of low income, and 269 units would be
for residents with very low incomes -- $37,350 or less for a family
of four.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark is working with Calabasas developer Wayne Colmer to add
six below-market homes in a housing development called
MoonDance-Moorpark, south of the former school district headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Colmer's 22-home tract, where most houses will cost $250,000 to
$300,000, includes three of the discounted houses. He will construct
three more on an adjacent parcel the city bought last year for
$360,000.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said Moorpark would purchase each of the three homes for no
more than $127,500 for resale to low-income residents.</TE>

<HD>Foggy San Francisco Sees Bright Future in Solar Cells</HD>
<DH>The city unveils the first of several projects intended to
ease reliance on fossil fuels for electricity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>This famously foggy city, home to cold, cloudy and often capricious
weather, now wants to lighten its image to something decidedly
sunlit: as the nation's leading municipal producer of solar power and
renewable energy.</LD>
<LD>   On an unseasonably bright Thursday, Mayor Willie Brown unveiled
what officials hope will be the first of several solar power
refurbishment projects to make the city less reliant on aging fossil
fuel-burning generators.</LD>
<LD>   Capitalizing on a $100-million public solar power bond issue
passed by voters in 2001, officials soon will begin installing
thousands of photovoltaic panels atop the Moscone Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   The $5.2-million project, which includes a retrofit of existing
power and heating systems, is expected to save the city $200,000 in
energy costs and enough power annually to generate electricity for
more than 1,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming that such solar power conversions eventually will pay for
themselves, officials hope to set an energy-saving standard for other
cities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco voters have spoken," Brown said of last year's bond
measure, which passed by an overwhelming 73%. "They want cleaner,
greener sources of energy that reduce our reliance on polluting power
generated out of the area."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said officials have heard from 15 cities -- including San
Diego, Denver and New York -- that may seek to emulate San
Francisco's precedent of publicly funding a transition to renewable
energy, which eventually could bring down the cost of solar power.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Bonnie Raitt -- a longtime advocate of renewable energy --
drew raucous applause from a crowd of about 200 when she described
the solar power movement as a foreign policy alternative to waging
war in oil-producing regions of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Solar power is the most patriotic act we can commit," the singer
said in her signature raspy voice. "It makes our country less
dependent on foreign oil and less likely to go to war."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to last year's statewide energy crisis, Raitt called the
solar project an insurance policy so that "no gas or power company
can ever hold our state for ransom ever again."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Ammiano likened the solar power push to a song in
the movie "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is often referred to as Oz," Ammiano said. "The
movie includes a little ditty that goes, 'Step out of the woods, step
out of the dark and into the light.' Well, San Francisco has stepped
out into the light on its journey down the yellow brick road."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Smeloff, assistant general manager for power policy at the
city's Public Utilities Commission, said solar power and San
Francisco are not incompatible concepts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this misconception that we're all fog," he told the City
Hall gathering. "We need to recast San Francisco from the foggy city
to the sunny city."</TE>

<HD>Dr. Esther Somerfeld-Ziskind, 101; Pioneering Physician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Esther Somerfeld-Ziskind, a pioneering neurologist and
psychiatrist whose seven-decade career spanned much of the history of
those specialties in Los Angeles, has died. She was 101.</LD>
<LD>   Somerfeld-Ziskind was seeing patients and attending weekly
learning sessions at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, where she was
the oldest former resident, until shortly before her death Nov. 13
from natural causes. She died at her home in Silver Lake, said her
daughter, Emile Jacobson of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A Chicago native, she was one of the first doctors in Los Angeles
to prescribe lithium for depression, former colleagues said. With her
husband, Dr. Eugene Ziskind, she also helped introduce group
psychotherapy to Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a legend," said Dr. Roberta Williams, vice president for
pediatrics and academic affairs at Childrens. "She never lost her
zest for new knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of Romanian and Hungarian immigrants,
Somerfeld-Ziskind worked her way through school in the early 1920s as
a secretary and as a manuscript editor for the Journal of the
American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   She planned to become a social worker but changed her mind after
meeting some pre-med students. After completing pre-med studies at
the University of Chicago, she entered Rush Medical College in
Chicago, where she received her degree in 1925.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to California later that year to begin an internship at
what was then Los Angeles County General Hospital. She then served a
pediatric residency at Childrens Hospital, but practiced pediatrics
for only a short time. In 1928, she married Ziskind, whom she had met
as an undergraduate in Chicago, and joined him in specializing in
neurology and the then-fledgling field of psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   When she began in the field, there were few options for treating
the mentally ill. She often told of working with a prominent
psychiatrist in Rosemead whose treatment of depressed patients
consisted of bed rest and milk every hour. "The milk," she explained,
"was to build you up."</TE>
<TE>   But advances were coming. Soon the Ziskinds were experimenting
with insulin and electric shock therapy. Over the 70 years of
Somerfeld-Ziskind's career, she would witness other changes,
including development of psychotropic "wonder drugs," such as lithium
and Prozac.</TE>
<TE>   She and Ziskind started their own small general practice on
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles during the Depression. Because of
the number of patients who could not afford their services, each
worked for pay only half the time, deciding they could get by on
essentially one salary.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for their services, many patients gave them gifts,
such as oil paintings and musical manuscripts. Somerfeld-Ziskind
remembered with particular pleasure one barter that brought her a
hand-woven silk cloak that had belonged to an ex-wife of Groucho
Marx.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, she and Ziskind launched lecture-discussion groups at the
old Cedars of Lebanon Hospital (a predecessor of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center). The sessions were the first therapy groups in the city,
according to the Southern California Psychiatric Society, which cited
that contribution when it presented the couple with an award for
distinguished service in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, the couple founded a free psychiatric clinic at the old
Cedars hospital. It gave rise to the Los Angeles Psychiatric Service,
which continues today as the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Somerfeld-Ziskind also headed the psychiatry department at Cedars
of Lebanon during the 1940s, when most of its members were men.</TE>
<TE>   She later joined the faculty at USC's medical school, teaching
child psychiatry, group therapy and psychopathology.</TE>
<TE>   She also collaborated on research with her husband. In 1932, they
won a research prize from the California Medical Assn. for their work
on tuberculosis-meningitis. She wrote her master's thesis in
psychology at UCLA about a four-year study showing that the sedative
phenobarbital did not impair the intellect of epilepsy patients.</TE>
<TE>   Somerfeld-Ziskind never fully retired, even though she relied on a
wheelchair and a driver to get around during her last years. She was
the most faithful attendee at Childrens Hospital's "grand rounds,"
weekly sessions where faculty members learn about new developments in
pediatrics. And, until a few months ago, she continued to see a few
patients at her home.</TE>
<TE>   An accomplished classical pianist, she owned two baby grands. She
was often host for performances of eight-handed compositions that she
played on the pianos with three of her friends.</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote book reviews for the journal of the American
Psychiatric Assn., regularly analyzing texts of 1,000 pages or more
as recently as last year.</TE>
<TE>   "When I asked [the editors] if they had any idea she was 100 years
old, they looked at me and laughed," said Williams, the Childrens
Hospital vice president. "It was obvious to me they had no idea of
her age. They probably knew her as the one reviewer who would turn in
her reviews on time.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing about her writing or speaking that would give
her away."</TE>
<TE>   A voracious reader who had books piled high on her nightstand, the
centenarian belonged to two book discussion clubs. Glen Hamor, a
former professor of pharmacy at USC who was co-chairman of a book
club for the university's retirees, said Somerfeld-Ziskind was a
vibrant, witty participant who rarely missed a session in the last 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   She was the oldest member "by quite a few years," Hamor said, but
had no trouble keeping up with the younger ones, whose specialties
ranged from business to physics.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd leave the book discussion," Hamor recalled, "and then go to
a double-piano workout with someone."</TE>
<TE>   Somerfeld-Ziskind is survived by her daughter, two grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren. Her husband of 65 years died in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Her family asks that any memorial donations be sent to Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Room MS29, Los Angeles CA
90027.</TE>

<HD>Authorities Hit Skid Row Again</HD>
<DH>This time, officers fan out in early evening. Advocate for
homeless calls it 'grandstanding.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As darkness fell Thursday, authorities launched a second round of
sweeps through Los Angeles' skid row, a vast homeless encampment just
east of downtown where officials say they are determined to root out
lawless elements.</LD>
<LD>   Police said "Operation Enough" was intended to address a growing
problem of parole and probation violators who are avoiding prison by
living in the densely populated, litter-strewn area.</LD>
<LD>   The operation was launched after business organizations decried
the huge homeless population in the area, but officials said that
complaints had nothing to do with the sweep, which has been planned
for months partly in response to double-digit increases in homeless
assaulting or robbing each other.</LD>
<TE>   "What we are really trying to do is reduce aggravated assaults and
robberies in the skid row area," said Los Angeles Police Capt.
Charlie Beck. "Either you catch them in the act or you remove them
another way." Beck reiterated that police were going after those who
pose a threat to the community, not targeting the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Around 5 p.m. Thursday, hundreds of law enforcement officers from
the Los Angeles Police Department, the California Department of
Corrections and the California Youth Authority, as well as federal
agents, began massing near police headquarters at Parker Center. The
Corrections Department was the lead agency in the sweeps, and many
parole officers came from around the state to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Following a briefing, authorities fanned through the neighborhood,
some carrying photographs of suspected parole and probation
violators. They swept into low-cost hotels, shined flashlights into
tents and questioned people on the street. The majority of people on
the row, however, were left alone.</TE>
<TE>   But a homeless advocate Thursday blasted what she called
indiscriminate harassment of one of the city's most vulnerable
populations.</TE>
<TE>   "They went after everybody," said Alice Callaghan, an Episcopal
priest and former Catholic nun who runs Las Familias del Pueblo.
Talking of Wednesday's sweeps, she said, "They stood up whole lines
of people against the walls. This was not a carefully targeted
assault against criminals.... And if they knew about all these
criminals before, why did they wait for one day to grandstand? What
was the purpose?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they did not have a figure on how many people were
arrested Thursday. Wednesday's sweep resulted in 108 arrests, 57 of
them for parole violations and two for violating probation.</TE>
<TE>   Police refused repeated requests Thursday to identify those
arrested. Beck, commander of the LAPD's Central Division, said most
arrests were for drug offenses or those who were found in violation
of parole for prior drug offenses. But the group included people who
had been in prison for assault, burglary, robbery and drug dealing,
he said. Police confiscated many weapons, including knives.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the parole and probation arrests, 19 people were
arrested for felony violations, mostly drug possession. Eight were
arrested on misdemeanor violations, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Another six arrests were for outstanding felony warrants and 14
for outstanding misdemeanor warrants. Again, police refused to
identify the suspects or their alleged crimes. One juvenile was
arrested on an outstanding warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities on Wednesday also impounded six cars, made one arrest
for drunk driving and handed out 100 traffic citations, both for
moving violations and for jaywalking. Those cited were not taken into
custody, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Each of those accused of violating their parole was taken to the
county jail and will soon appear before a deputy court commissioner
to determine whether they will be returned to prison, said Jerome
Marsh, administrator of parole and community services for the
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan, the homeless advocate, strongly criticized the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our new police chief wants everybody to know who's in
town. And while he hasn't been able to do anything about the gang
killings in South-Central, he can easily come down and assault the
poorest and most vulnerable in the community. I think that just shows
that he's a coward."</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan said she considered the first-night roundup of 108
people to be a relatively paltry catch for the police. "The raid
proves that most of the homeless on skid row are not criminals.
That's the only good news to come out of yesterday," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, discussing the raid on Wednesday, insisted that the
police were attacking criminal behavior, not homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about kicking the homeless off the streets," he said.
"I have great compassion for the homeless. But many of these people
arrested are violent offenders who make skid row unsafe for people
who truly have nowhere else to go."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Hernandez, 74, who has lived at the King Edward Hotel on
5th Street for the last five years, welcomed the sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see the police,'' Hernandez said Thursday night.
"Maybe other people have problems with the police, but there are bad
people out here."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he had far fewer tools to deal with bad behavior on
city streets than he had as police commissioner in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He cited California laws that prohibit arrests of people who
urinate or defecate in public if there are no public restrooms
immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Shifting Gears to Become a Teacher</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified is looking for 1,000 mid-career professionals
to teach math, science and other subjects at its lowperforming
schools.</DH>

<LD>Roy Romer, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District,
put out the welcome mat Thursday for professionals, including
accountants, attorneys, bankers and engineers, who are considering a
career switch.</LD>
<LD>   "If you have any interest in becoming a teacher, come talk to us,"
Romer said, announcing a stepped-up effort to recruit and retrain
1,000 professionals to teach in low-performing schools.</LD>
<LD>   Officials hope those new teachers will be ready for the next
school year, particularly in the subject areas of math, science and
special education, where the need is most critical.</LD>
<TE>   The rookies will be hired through the fast-track Los Angeles
Teaching Fellows Program under the nationwide New Teacher Project,
which also has worked with school districts in Kansas, New York,
Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Los Angeles district hired 130 teachers through the
program, which requires candidates to attend a six-week training
session in which they learn about classroom management, instruction
and planning.</TE>
<TE>   The recruits next become interns in the district for three years,
during which they will continue to train, take education courses and
teach classes. If they pass an exam at the end, they will earn their
state-approved teacher credentials as if they had attended the
traditional post-bachelor's program at Cal State campuses.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young said campuses benefit from
having a mix of mid-career, highly experienced and new college
graduates together on a teaching team.</TE>
<TE>   "I encourage all our former dot-com friends and techies to come
join us," Young said at a news conference Thursday morning at John C.
Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Val Holwerda, a former advertising director and owner of a
printing company, left her career and entered the fellows program
last year. She began teaching English at Fremont in August. She
enjoys her job, and said the program helped incorporate her
management, supervisory and organizational skills in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The program valued my experience," she said. "You have to think
of it as a challenge and as something that is intellectually
stimulating."</TE>
<TE>   The 38,000-teacher district has hired an average of 4,000 teachers
each year since 1998. This year, nearly half of its new hires were
credentialed, up from 40% in several previous years. Others had
bachelor's degrees only and were hired on a so-called emergency
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified is under pressure to hire more trained
teachers because of a federal law passed last year that requires
teachers in every state to be fully credentialed by the end of the
2005-06 school year.</TE>
<TE>   The New Teacher Project has launched programs in 17 states, and
developed 10 training institutes since 1997. It has trained more than
3,000 teachers nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning teachers in the Los Angeles district with no experience
will earn $35,905, while those who have more experience or college
course credits may earn slightly more. Candidates must have a
bachelor's degree and a minimum 2.7 grade-point average to apply.</TE>
<TE>   The early application deadline is Feb. 7, and the regular deadline
is March 7. For more information, check the Web site

<HD>New Address Planned for Ancient Oak in Santa Clarita Valley</HD>
<DH>Initial relocation work could begin next week. Protester
vows to stay in the tree 'till the end.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Clarita Valley developer announced plans Thursday to
transplant a 400-year-old oak dubbed Old Glory that stands in the
path of a road-widening project needed to accommodate future growth.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Rattazzi, president of John Laing Homes, said the oak will be
boxed and moved about a quarter of a mile east along Pico Canyon
Road. It is to become the centerpiece of an 18-acre park that will
include 170 newly planted oaks. He said preliminary work could begin
next week.</LD>
<LD>   John Quigley, 42, however, said he's not budging from his perch in
the ancient oak, where he has managed to stave off bulldozers for the
last three weeks. "I'm staying till the end," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Quigley said he misses his family and hopes the end may be near,
perhaps by Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   If Rattazzi is serious, Quigley said, he should "put his money
where his mouth is" and take out a $10-million insurance bond as a
precautionary measure in case the tree dies after it is moved.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sitting tight," said Quigley, a Pacific Palisades resident
recruited by local activists for the campaign that has drawn national
media attention and the support of actress Rene Russo.</TE>
<TE>   "If the tree dies, the money would go to an Old Glory legacy fund
to preserve oaks," Quigley said.</TE>
<TE>   Although initial work on the tree project could begin in a few
days, the actual move will not start for at least three months,
Rattazzi said. He said the work can begin with Quigley still in the
tree. But at some point the activist will have to come down, ready or
not.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Rattazzi said, Quigley is trespassing and could be
forced off the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not safe to move the tree with him in it," he said. "We'll
look for the Sheriff's Department to assist us in whatever way
necessary to move that tree. Mr. Quigley is not going to be doing the
tree any good by staying on his perch."</TE>
<TE>   Rattazzi said his company has assembled a team of experts --
arborists, landscape architects and oak tree specialists -- to
perform the move, which will begin with trenching and boxing of the
tree.</TE>
<TE>   The oak must then remain where it is for at least 90 days while
steel beams are wedged under its roots. Meanwhile, soil will be
imported to the new site to help in the transplanting, said oak tree
specialist Lee Newman, president of L. Newman Design Group.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree has been growing in a creek-side setting and will be
moving to an upland, oak-wood setting," Newman said. "We'll try to
mimic conditions as best we can."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after February, the oak will be moved to its new location
on a huge dolly -- similar to the type used to move the space
shuttle, Newman said. The tree is healthy and it is the right time of
year to begin relocation, but no one can be sure of the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is there no 100% assurance it won't die if it's moved,
there's no 100% assurance it will live if it stays where it is,"
Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   Rattazzi would not disclose how much the move will cost, but said
that it will be "substantially more" than $250,000. The company has
already spent about $1 million on environmental issues in Pico
Canyon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Quigley was joined in the tree Thursday by his brother
Kevin of St. Paul, Minn., who had been following the standoff on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to come and see him to let him know his family is behind
him," Kevin Quigley said over a two-way radio while sitting on the
perch beside his brother. "We're all proud of him."</TE>

<LD>A 14-year-old was shot to death Thursday after a fistfight in Los
Angeles, and a half-hour later a man was chased down the street and
killed near Cheviot Hills, bringing to 18 the number of suspected
homicides in the county since Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The first shooting occurred just after 4 p.m. in the parking lot
of a doughnut shop at Western and Vermont avenues. The killer fired
repeatedly at the 14-year-old and fled, police Capt. James Miller
said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting did not appear to be related to gangs or to the eight
other shootings that have taken place along Western since Nov. 12,
Miller said.</LD>
<TE>   About 4:35 p.m., a 20-year-old man was chased on foot for about a
block and shot repeatedly in the backyard of a home in the 1900 block
of Preuss Road, south of Beverly Hills. He was pronounced dead at
Cedars Sinai Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it involved graffiti, somebody crossing out someone's
graffiti, getting chased and getting shot at," police Lt. Mike Menza
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief William J. Bratton on Wednesday said he was "very
disturbed and angry" about the rash of killings near the end of one
of the most violent years in recent city history and urged residents
and police to fight back.</TE>

<LD>A 21-year-old Oxnard man died Thursday when he failed to yield for a
stop sign at a busy intersection and his car was broadsided by a
sport utility vehicle, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial fisherman Jose Luis Gonzales Guzman died about 2:45
a.m. at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, about an hour
after the crash at K and 5th streets, said Deputy Coroner Craig
Stevens.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Guzman was driving a Dodge Neon south on K Street
when he failed to stop at the sign. A Ford Explorer carrying three
people and headed west on 5th Street slammed into the driver's side
of Guzman's car.</LD>
<TE>   The 29-year-old driver of the Explorer and his two passengers,
ages 52 and 23, all of Oxnard, suffered minor injuries.</TE>

<HD>Teacher of the Year Is a Study in Motivation</HD>
<DH>For Tamara Thornell of Oxnard, one of five educators to be
honored by the state, the profession is 'amazingly rewarding.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard teacher Tamara Thornell rarely stops thinking about her
classroom.</LD>
<LD>   At home on weekends, she ponders lesson plans.</LD>
<LD>   Vacationing in Mexico, she stopped to buy bilingual books and
maracas for her second-graders at Brekke School.</LD>
<TE>   Even last week, when Thornell was in the hospital having her first
baby, she grabbed a handful of handouts she thought might be useful
for a health lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Such enthusiasm for her students and her profession has made
Thornell stand out at her school and in Ventura County. Now she is
being recognized as one of five California Teachers of the Year,
state education officials announced this week.</TE>
<TE>   "From the first second of every day, teaching is amazingly
rewarding," said Thornell, 32, instructor in a bilingual class for
nine years. "I love the students. And I love everything about
watching them grow and learn."</TE>
<TE>   That is obvious to those who have seen her at work, said Renne
Ripps, principal at Brekke.</TE>
<TE>   Thornell's classroom is a learning wonderland, Ripps said. She has
a knack for giving individual help to children -- particularly those
dealing with poverty or violence at home.</TE>
<TE>   And her patient, sweet demeanor is the "epitome of what a teacher
should be," Ripps added.</TE>
<TE>   "She goes over and beyond what's expected," Ripps said. "If a
family can't come to school for parent conferences, she'll go to
their house to meet with them. She really connects with people."</TE>
<TE>   In her classroom, Thornell works to ensure each child builds
self-esteem and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Stemming from her own experience as a shy grade-schooler, Thornell
has folded a strong public-speaking element into her lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Every Tuesday, her second-graders must read aloud a paragraph they
have written, eventually while standing at the front of the room. On
Fridays, students recite a poem or sing a song they have memorized
for the rest of the class.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she teaches students to applaud after every
speech -- no matter what. For those who start out speaking very
softly, she hands them a microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want them growing up shy and quiet -- they need to be
outgoing," Thornell said. "You could hide in a corner and go a year
without being noticed, but how much are you learning?"</TE>
<TE>   Thornell also is focused on technology, teaching her students how
to use Power Point and helping them create their own Web pages.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the year students compile samples of their work in
an "e-portfolio" that they present to the class. She also puts on
workshops to help other teachers incorporate computer programs into
their classes. "Technology is such a fabulous way to reach kids,"
Thornell said.</TE>
<TE>   Loving the idea that she could help others succeed, Thornell never
doubted she would become a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, she said, she would persuade her siblings to "play
school" when class was not in session. And in the seventh grade she
ran a summer preschool club for kids in her neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "They all seemed to be so happy and having fun," Thornell
recalled. "I thought, 'It'd be cool to do this for a living.' "</TE>
<TE>   She graduated from UC Davis in 1993 with a major in math and minor
in Spanish, and got her bilingual education credential the next year.
Two years ago she earned a master's degree in educational technology
from Azusa Pacific University.</TE>
<TE>   Her career began in Oxnard at Cesar Chavez Elementary School,
where she taught first- and second-grade classes for three years
before moving to Brekke.</TE>
<TE>   The Teacher of the Year award is granted to only a handful of
educators from across the state. The news came just days after she
gave birth to Jacqueline. "I'm having a really good week," Thornell
said. "Life can't get any better than this."</TE>

<HD>At Washington Prep, Lots of Toil to Offset Trouble</HD>
<DH>With complaints of chaos triggering action, the many
success stories also can't be denied.</DH>

<LD>A mid-level Los Angeles Unified official named William Elkins earlier
this week stood in the doorway of Washington Preparatory High School
and temporarily barred reporters. The campus is not safe enough for
visitors to look around, he explained in one breath. In the next,
came a boast: Washington has academic and extracurricular successes
that are too often ignored.</LD>
<LD>   That is the strange dichotomy that faces Washington -- and other
urban high schools where safety and order sometimes collapse. At this
campus of three-story brick buildings and green lawns near Century
Boulevard and Western Avenue, the wonderful and the terrible coexist,
albeit uncomfortably.</LD>
<LD>   Even as teachers and students publicly aired complaints this week
about fights, robberies, open student sex and drug use, they
expressed fear that the perception of Washington would become worse
than reality. And as district Supt. Roy Romer visited the campus
Thursday and pledged to buck up Washington's security immediately, he
boasted about its test scores, which have risen slightly from among
the worst in the state.</LD>
<TE>   Its motto displayed in the main foyer ("Worthy Deeds Harmoniously
Achieved"), Washington is a place where a student can lose a cell
phone to pickpockets and also take two years of calculus.</TE>
<TE>   Brandi Welch, the student body vice president, cringes as she
walks through a third floor alcove notorious for drugs and sex -- on
her way to a college-level psychology class.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really two worlds in there," says Welch of the 3,800-student
campus. "The school is so big, it feels like five or six different
schools."</TE>
<TE>   When it opened 75 years ago, Washington attracted students to what
was then a semi-rural setting with its hard-to-find programs in
subjects such as aviation. In 1981, Principal George McKenna, trying
to focus students on college, added "preparatory" to the school name
and opened magnet schools within the school.</TE>
<TE>   McKenna later became the subject of a Denzel Washington television
movie, "The George McKenna Story." His successor, Marguerite P. La
Motte, became so influential locally that she is now running for the
school board.</TE>
<TE>   The principal for the last two years, James Noble, has suffered by
comparison, with teachers saying he does not have a strong enough
personality to command a high school of such operatic highs and lows.
Noble said security is being improved but declined to answer
questions about his role. On Thursday, Romer said he strongly backs
Noble.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's test scores put it in the worst 10% of schools in the
state's Academic Performance Index, though it made slight gains last
year. But nearly one-third of its students are enrolled in one of
three academically ambitious magnet schools within Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Those magnets -- music/performing arts, math/science and
communications -- send 90% of their students to college.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 took Advanced Placement exams, or college-level
tests, last spring, according to the school's own data.</TE>
<TE>   In the school's renowned jazz band program, only two students in
the last 12 years have not gone to college.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had job offers," says Fernando Pullum, the band director and
music magnet coordinator. Just a few months ago, a charter school
offered him a $20,000 raise and more vacation. "But this is a great
school. Why should I have to leave?"</TE>
<TE>   Pullum says troublemakers leave music magnet students alone out of
respect for their success.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, even as teachers declared the school "unsafe"
and "out of control," Pullum had the jazz band practicing until 9
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Since being recruited to Washington in 1984 by McKenna, Pullum has
transformed the jazz band from a two-student afterthought into three
18-member ensembles, which are deluged with offers of gigs.</TE>
<TE>   The jazz band has performed with Lionel Hampton, Wynton Marsalis
and Jackson Browne, who donated $150,000 to a foundation that
supports the arts at Washington High.</TE>
<TE>   While school police tried to identify gang members who weren't
supposed to be on campus, well-behaved music magnet students, who
were supposed to be on vacation this week, sneaked in for extra
practice on their instruments.</TE>
<TE>   In the band room, at least, Pullum can ensure discipline. Students
who miss a note must do five push-ups on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to make role models. So when this news about
Washington's problems came out this week, it felt like 10 steps
backwards," Pullum says. "No one makes the distinction. Kids hear
that Washington is dangerous and they'll go somewhere else instead of
coming and participating in our program."</TE>
<TE>   Washington's teachers say they decided to go public with their
safety concerns this week for similar reasons. The atmosphere, they
add, is not so much physically dangerous for them but is very
difficult for teaching and learning.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Holligan said the school was so lenient with tardiness that
his health classes never started on time. English teacher Eugene
Mackey complained that noise from hallway fights was disrupting his
teaching of "A Raisin in the Sun."</TE>
<TE>   Romer, after Thursday's visit, said the school could be made safer
simply by adding security cameras, hiring 10 security staffers and
finishing the iron perimeter fence with $37,000 allocated weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have work to do," Romer said, adding: "I intend not to let
this school drift back into an uncontrolled, undisciplined campus."</TE>
<TE>   Those changes will begin to take shape in early December. On
Thursday, however, teenagers from the neighborhood -- some of them
not students -- were still sneaking through holes in the fence. One
organized a spirited game of craps on an athletic field.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers said their protest letters and angry statements were
signs of life at Washington: They felt they had something to protect.</TE>
<TE>   "This school is out of control," said Annette Harrison, an English
teacher and leader of the protests. "But it's still a good school."</TE>

<CX>   Washington High -- In Friday's Orange County edition, a photo caption
in the California section gave the wrong names for some student
government leaders at Washington Preparatory High School. In the
photo with the incorrect caption, the student on the left had been
cropped out but was still named in the caption. In the photo shown
above, the correct identifications are, from left, Sheena Fairman,
Brandi Welch and Brandon Rainey. The woman in the background is
unidentified.</CX>
